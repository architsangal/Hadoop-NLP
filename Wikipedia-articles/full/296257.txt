[ April 2011 ] INSEE ( [ Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques ], pronounced [ inse ] { Not the } [ [ɛ̃se] ] { expected from the rules of French orthography } ) is the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies. It collects and publishes information on the French economy and society, carrying out the periodic national census. Located in Paris, it is the French branch of Eurostat, European Statistical System. The INSEE was created in 1946 as a successor to the National Statistics Service (SNS) created under Vichy during World War II. [ Purpose ] INSEE is responsible for the production and analysis of official statistics in France. Its best known responsibilities include: Organizing and publishing the national census Producing various indices – which are widely recognised as being of excellent quality – including an inflation index used for determining the rates of rents and the costs associated with construction. Eurostat uses INSEE statistics in combination with those of other national statistical agencies to compile comparable statistics for the EU as a whole. It is also widely recognized as representing France on international questions of statistics. [ Organization ] INSEE is the responsibility of MINEFE, the French Ministry of Finance. The current director is Jean-Philippe Cotis. However, Eurostat considers INSEE as an independent body, although its independence is not written in the law. { ACDC2007.free.fr, Eurostat report } [ Teaching and research ] Research and teaching for INSEE is undertake by GENES, or Group of the National Schools of the Economy and Statistics (French: G&apos;roupe des Écoles Nationales d&apos;Économie et S&apos;tatistique) which includes: ENSAE (L&apos;École nationale de la statistique et de l&apos;administration économique), a grande école which trains INSEE administrators and engineers specialized in statistics, the economy, and finance. ENSAI, (L&apos;École nationale de la statistique et de l&apos;analyse de l&apos;information), an engineering school. [ Codes and numbering system ] [ INSEE code ] INSEE gives numerical indexing codes (French: les Codes INSEE) to various entities in France: 2 digits ( département ) and 3 digits (commune) for the 96 départements of Metropolitan France. 3 digits (département or collectivity) and 2 digits (commune) for the Overseas departments, Overseas Territorial Collectivities and Overseas Countries and Territories.

In 1833, the Statistics Bureau (French: Bureau de la statistique) was created by Adolphe Thiers. In 1840 it was renamed SGF or General Statistics of France. { (French: S&apos;tatistique Générale de la F&apos;rance) } Under the direction of Lucien March, the SGF expanded its activities. It began an investigation of consumption habits in 1907, following with periodic investigations on retail prices in 1911. In 1920 Alfred Sauvy introduced competitive entrance exams for SGF recruitment. However, it was René Carmille, a pioneer of the use of the calculators, who laid the foundations of the modern organization. In 1940, the Demographic Service (Service de la démographie) was created under the Ministry of Finance in order to replace the military recruitment office prohibited by the June 1940 Armistice with Nazi Germany. In order to better conceal its undertakings, the Demographic Service absorbed the SGF on 11 October 1941. The new organization was called the SNS or National Statistics Service. { (French: S&apos;ervice National des S&apos;tatistiques) } As part of this reorganization, six new offices were created in the Northern (occupied) zone whose regional structure is maintained today in INSEE. René Carmille created an Applied Sciences School (predecessor of the current ENSAE ) to specially train members for the SNS. Carmille worked for Vichy France but he was actually a double agent for the French underground. From his position in the SNS he sabotaged the Nazi census of France, which saved untold numbers of Jewish people from death camps. He also used his department to help mobilize French resistance in Algeria. He was caught by the Nazis and sent to Dachau where he died in 1945. { IBM and the Holocaust, Edwin Black, 2001, Crown, p 320-332, } [ Creation of INSEE ] The SNS was finally transformed into INSEE by the law of 27 April 1946, The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Surveys for the metropolis and overseas France (L&apos;Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques pour la métropole et la France d&apos;outre-mer).
