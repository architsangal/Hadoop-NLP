During a flurry of subsequent legal actions, Walmart discontinued store-level meatcutting and started shipping in pre-packaged/pre-frozen meat to their stores. When all the hearings and appeals were exhausted, it was decided that the local meatcutters didn&apos;t embody the characteristics of a group that could bargain since they weren&apos;t specialized, while Walmart was found to have engaged in unfair labor practices. Even now, there is no one in the Jacksonville meat department to make special cuts of meat or any union presence there. { Wal-Mart&apos;s &quot; Meat Wars &quot; With Union Sizzles On, HuffingtonPost.com, Al Norman--writer, March 16, 2008.
