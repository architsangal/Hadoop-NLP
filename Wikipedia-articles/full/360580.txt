[ 965 3 28 y ] Arnulf of Flanders (c. 890 – March 28, 965), called the Great, was the third Count of Flanders, who ruled the County of Flanders, an area that is now northwestern Belgium and southwestern Holland. [ Life ] Arnulf was the son of count Baldwin II of Flanders and Ælfthryth of Wessex, daughter of Alfred the Great. { Detlev Schwennicke, Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten, Neue Folge, Band II (Verlag von J. A. Stargardt, Marburg, Germany, 1984), Tafel 5 } Through his mother he was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon kings of England and through his father a descendant of Charlemagne. { The Annals of } { Flodoard of Reims, 919-966, ed. Steven Fanning &amp; Bernard S. Bachrach (University of Toronto Press, CA, 2011), p. xx } Presumably Arnulf was named after Saint Arnulf of Metz a progenitor of Carolingian dynasty. { Philip Grierson, &apos;The Relations between England and Flanders before the Norman Conquest&apos;, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Vol. 23 (1941), p. 86 n. 1 } At the death of their father, Baldwin II in 918, Arnulf became Count of Flanders while his brother Adeloft succeeded to the county of Bologne However in 933 Adeloft died and Arnulf took the countship of Boulogne for himself, but later restored it to his nephew, Arnulf II, Count of Boulogne. { Renée Nip, &apos;The Political Relations between England and Flanders (1066-1128)&apos;, Anglo-Norman Studies 21: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1998, ed. Christopher Harper-Bill (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, UK, 1999), p. 150 } Arnulf I greatly expanded Flemish rule to the south, taking all or part of Artois, Ponthieu, Amiens, and Ostravent. He exploited the conflicts between Charles the Simple and Robert I of France, and later those between Louis IV and his baron s. In his southern expansion Arnulf inevitably had conflict with the Normans, who were trying to secure their northern frontier. This led to the 943 murder of the Duke of Normandy, William Longsword, at the hands of Arnulf&apos;s men. The Viking threat was receding during the later years of Arnulf&apos;s life, and he turned his attentions to the reform of the Flemish government. [ Family ] The name of Adulf&apos;s first wife is unknown but he had at least one daughter by her: { Heather J.

In 934 he married Adele of Vermandois, daughter of Herbert II of Vermandois. Their children were: Hildegarde, born c. 934 and died in 990; she married Dirk II, Count of Holland. It is uncertain whether she is his daughter by his first or second wife. Liutgard, born 935, died in 962, she married Wichmann IV, Count of Hamaland. Egbert, died 953. Baldwin III of Flanders. Elftrude, married Siegfried, Count of Guînes. [ Succession ] Arnulf made his eldest son and heir Baldwin III of Flanders co-ruler in 958, but Baldwin died untimely in 962, so Arnulf was succeeded by Baldwin&apos;s infant son, Arnulf II of Flanders.
