Detective Fiction - the collector&apos;s guide: Second Edition (pp. 82, 87) Scholar Press. 1994; ISBN 0-85967-991-8 } { &quot; American Tribute to Agatha Christie &quot; } and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in November of the same year. { Chris Peers, Ralph Spurrier and Jamie Sturgeon. Collins Crime Club – A checklist of First Editions. Dragonby Press (Second Edition), March 1999 (p. 15) } The U.S. edition retailed $ 2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6). The title is taken from a catechism in the Book of Common Prayer which asks, &quot; What is your Christian name? Answer N. or M. &quot; { A CATECHISM FROM THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER, 1549, ENLARGED, 1637, REVISED IN THE BISHOP WHITE BOOK, 1785, NOW AGAIN REVISED AND ENLARGED } The novel is the first to feature the mature versions of her detectives Tommy and Tuppence, whose previous appearances had been in the adventure The Secret Adversary (1922) and the short story collection Partners in Crime (1929). [ Plot introduction ] After the outbreak of the Second World War and many years after they worked for British intelligence, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford feel useless and sidelined. When Tommy is approached to go undercover once more, however, Tuppence decides to join him on his mission whether she is wanted or not. The duo begin a search for a German agent who may have infiltrated British command. Another British agent that was following these Germans left a cryptic message on his deathbed: &quot; N or M. Song Susie &quot;. Grant knew that &quot; Song Susie &quot; stood for Sans Souci, a hotel in Leahampton, and N and M were two German spies, one male and one female. Tommy is to go to Sans Souci to investigate whether N, M or both are at the hotel and to figure out their identities. [ Literary significance and reception ] Maurice Willson Disher&apos;s review in The Times Literary Supplement of 29 November 1941 began by saying, &quot; To believe that N or M? is not Miss Agatha Christie&apos;s best is difficult while the first fine anxious rapture of her latest story is still troubling the mind. &quot; He concluded, &quot; The point is reached when you begin to fear for your own sanity on catching yourself wondering whether an ingratiating babe-in-arms might not be Herr Doktor in disguise. Yet such is Miss Christie&apos;s skill in conjuring up the ominous that even infant prattle sounds uncommonly like a code for the Fifth Column. In other words, as Mr Robey has said before now, N or M? gets you. &quot; { The Times Literary Supplement, 29 November 1941 (p. 589) } Maurice Richardson in a short review in the 7 December 1941 issue of The Observer wrote: &quot; Agatha Christie takes time off from Poirot and the haute cuisine of crime to write a light war-time spy thriller. N or M is [an] unknown master Fifth Columnist concealed in [the] person of some shabby genteel figure in Bournemouth boarding-house... Christie&apos;s bright young couple, now middle-aged but active as ever, are nearly trapped. Nice surprise finish and all-round entertainment. &quot; { The Observer, 7 December 1941 (p. 3) } A short review by E.R. Punshon in The Guardian of 30 December 1941 ended with: &quot; Mrs. Christie shows herself as ingenious as ever, and one admires especially the way in which the hero snores himself out of captivity. &quot; { The Guardian, 30 December 1941 (p. 3) } Robert Barnard : &quot; The Beresfords contribute their intolerable high spirits to the war effort. Less racist than the earlier thrillers (in fact, some apology is made indirectly) but no more convincing. &quot; { Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive – an appreciation of Agatha Christie (revised edition; p. 193). Fontana Books, 1990; ISBN 0-00-637474-3 } [ References to other works ] In the book there are references to the first Tommy and Tuppence book, The Secret Adversary. For example, in chapter 1 Tuppence remembers how they saved a girl, found the secret document, etc. When Albert appears in the book, he remembers how Tommy and Tuppence first met.
