The river has achieved lasting fame as the main watercourse of the city of Rome, founded on its eastern banks. The river rises at Mount Fumaiolo in central Italy and flows in a generally southerly direction past Perugia and Rome to meet the sea at Ostia. Popularly called flavus ( &quot; the blond &quot; ), in reference to the yellowish colour of its water, the Tiber has heavily advanced at the mouth by about 3 km since Roman times, leaving the ancient port of Ostia Antica 6 km inland. { &quot; Tiber River. &quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006 } { &quot; Tiber &quot;. World Encyclopedia. Philip&apos;s, 2005. } However, it does not form a proportional delta, owing to a strong north-flowing sea current close to the shore, to the steep shelving of the coast, and to slow tectonic subsidence. [ Source of the Tiber ] The source of the Tiber consists of two springs [ 10 m ] away from each other on Mount Fumaiolo. These springs are called &quot; Le Vene. &quot; { Tiber Springs - Mount Fumaiolo } The springs are in a beech forest [ 1268 m ] above sea level. During the 1930s, Benito Mussolini placed an antique marble Roman column at the point where the river arises, inscribed QUI NASCE IL FIUME SACRO AI DESTINI DI ROMA ( &quot; Here is born the river / sacred to the destinies of Rome &quot; ). There is an eagle on the top of this column. The first miles of the Tiber run through Valtiberina before entering Umbria. { Tuscany tours - the origin of the Tiber River } [ Name ] It is probable that the name Tiber is pre-Latin, like the Roman name of Tibur (modern Tivoli ). It may be Etruscan or Italic in origin, possibly akin to the Celtic root-word dubr, &quot; water &quot;. The same root is believed to be the source of the Latin praenomen Tiberius, and its Etruscan cognate, Thefarie. { &quot; Tiber &quot;. Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names. } { John Everett-Heath. } { Oxford University Press 2005. } { George Davis Chase, &quot; The Origin of Roman Praenomina &quot;, in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol. VIII (1897) } The legendary king Tiberinus Silvius, or Thebris, ninth in the king-list of Alba Longa, was said to have drowned in the Albula River, which was subsequently renamed in his honour. { &quot; Tiber &quot;. Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names. } { John Everett-Heath. } { Oxford University Press 2005. } The myth may have explained a memory of an earlier, perhaps pre-Indo-European name for the river, &quot; white &quot; (alba) with sediment. According to the legend, Jupiter made him a god and guardian spirit of the river (also called Volturnus, &quot; rolling water &quot; ). This gave rise to the standard Roman depiction of the river as a powerfully built reclining river god, also named Tiberinus, with streams of water flowing from his hair and beard. { Tiber. Bloomsbury Dictionary of Myth (1996) } The River Tiber was also believed to be the river into which Romulus and Remus (the former founded Rome) were thrown as infants. [ History ] { Castel Sant&apos;Angelo from across the Tiber } According to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC on the banks of the Tiber about [ 25 km ] from the sea at Ostia. The island Isola Tiberina in the center of Rome, between Trastevere and the ancient center, was the site of an important ancient ford and was later bridged. Legend says Rome&apos;s founders, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, were abandoned on its waters, where they were rescued by a she-wolf. The river marked the boundary between the lands of the Etruscans to the west, the Sabines to the east and the Latins to the south. Benito Mussolini, born in Romagna, adjusted the boundary between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna, so that the springs of the Tiber would lie in Romagna. The Tiber was critically important to Roman trade and commerce, as ships could reach as far as [ 100 km mi -1 ] upriver; there is evidence that it was used to ship grain from the Val Teverina as long ago as the 5th century BC. { &quot; Tiber River. &quot; } { Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006 } It was later used to ship stone, timber and foodstuffs to Rome. During the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC, the harbour at Ostia became a key naval base. It later became Rome&apos;s most important port, where wheat, olive oil, and wine were imported from Rome&apos;s colonies around the Mediterranean. Wharves were also built along the riverside in Rome itself, lining the riverbanks around the Campus Martius area. The Romans connected the river with a sewer system (the Cloaca Maxima ) and with an underground network of tunnels and other channels, to bring its water into the middle of the city. Wealthy Romans had garden-parks or &quot; horti &quot; on the banks of the river in Rome up through the first century BC. { Horti:LacusCurtius • Gardens of Ancient Rome (Platner &amp; Ashby, 1929) } These may have been sold and developed about a century later. The heavy sedimentation of the river made it difficult to maintain Ostia, prompting the emperors Claudius and Trajan to establish a new port on the Fiumicino in the 1st century AD. They built a new road, the via Portuensis, to connect Rome with Fiumicino, leaving the city by Porta Portese (&apos;the port gate&apos;). Both ports were eventually abandoned due to silting. Several pope s attempted to improve navigation on the Tiber in the 17th and 18th century, with extensive dredging continuing into the 19th century. Trade was boosted for a while but by the 20th century silting had resulted in the river only being navigable as far as Rome itself. The Tiber was once known for its floods — the Campus Martius is a flood plain and would regularly flood to a depth of [ 2 m ]. The river is now confined between high stone embankments which were begun in 1876. Within the city, the riverbanks are lined by boulevards known as lungoteveri, streets &quot; along the Tiber. &quot; The Tiber in winter with St Peter&apos;s and the Castel Sant&apos;Angelo Because the river is identified with Rome, the term &quot; swimming the Tiber &quot; has come to be the Protestant shorthand term for converting to Roman Catholic ism. This is most common if the person who converts had been Anglican, the reverse of which is referred to as &quot; Swimming the Thames. &quot; In ancient Rome, executed criminals were thrown into the Tiber. People executed at the Gemonian stairs were thrown in the Tiber during the latter part of the reign of the emperor Tiberius. This practice continued over the centuries. For example, the corpse of Pope Formosus was thrown into the Tiber after the infamous Cadaver Synod held in 897. [ Bridges over the Tiber ] In addition to numerous modern bridge s over the Tiber in Rome, there remain several ancient bridges (now mostly pedestrian-only) that have survived in part (e.g., the Milvian Bridge and the Ponte Sant&apos;Angelo ) or in whole ( Fabricius&apos; Bridge ).
