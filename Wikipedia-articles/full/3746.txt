The screenplay, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The film depicts a dystopia n Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically engineered organic robots called replicant s —visually indistinguishable from adult humans—are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other &quot; mega–manufacturers &quot; around the world. Their use on Earth is banned and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial or leisure work on off-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and &quot; retired &quot; by police special operatives known as &quot; Blade Runners &quot;. The plot focuses on a brutal and cunning group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down. Blade Runner initially polarized critics: some were displeased with the pacing, while others enjoyed its thematic complexity. The film performed poorly in North American theaters but has since become a cult film. { Sammon, pp. xvi–xviii } The film has been hailed for its production design, depicting a &quot; retrofitted &quot; future, { Bukatman, p. 21; Sammon, p. 79 } and remains a leading example of the neo-noir genre.

Dick to the attention of Hollywood and several later films were based on his work. { Bukatman, p. 41 } Ridley Scott regards Blade Runner as &quot; probably &quot; his most complete and personal film.

Seven versions of the film have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by film executives. A rushed Director&apos;s Cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to workprint screenings. This, in conjunction with its popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first films released on DVD, resulting in a basic disc with mediocre video and audio quality.

July 26, 2007 July 27, 2011 ] [ Plot ] [ Note: There are several versions of &apos;&apos;Blade Runner&apos;&apos;. ] In Los Angeles, November 2019, retired police officer Rick Deckard ( Harrison Ford ) is detained and brought by officer Gaff ( Edward James Olmos ) to his former supervisor, Bryant ( M. Emmet Walsh ). Deckard, whose job as a &quot; Blade Runner &quot; was to track down bioengineered beings known as replicant s and &quot; retire &quot; them ( &quot; retire &quot; being the official term for the killing of replicants), is told by Bryant that several have escaped and come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan, and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives. Deckard watches a video of another Blade Runner named Holden ( Morgan Paull ) administering a &quot; Voight-Kampff &quot; test designed to distinguish humans from replicants based on their empathic response to questions. The subject of the test, Leon ( Brion James ), shoots Holden. Bryant wants Deckard to return to work to retire Leon and three other replicants— Roy Batty ( Rutger Hauer ), Zhora ( Joanna Cassidy ) and Pris ( Daryl Hannah ). Deckard refuses, but after Bryant makes a veiled threat, he reluctantly agrees. Sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models, Deckard discovers that Tyrell&apos;s ( Joe Turkel ) assistant Rachael ( Sean Young ) is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human; Rachael&apos;s consciousness has been enhanced with false memories to provide an &quot; emotional cushion &quot;. As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine if she is a replicant. Trying to find a way to meet with Tyrell, Roy and Leon go to the eye-manufacturing laboratory of Chew ( James Hong ), forcing him to divulge the identity of J.F. Sebastian ( William Sanderson ), a gifted designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo. Dropping the photo to the floor, Rachael leaves in tears after Deckard tells her that her memories are only implants taken from a real person. Sent by Roy, Pris meets and gains the confidence of Sebastian at his apartment, where he lives with manufactured companions. While searching Leon&apos;s apartment, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora, and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard retires Zhora, and shortly after is told by Bryant to add Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation headquarters, to his list of retirements. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd but is disarmed and attacked by Leon, who saw him kill Zhora. Rachael kills Leon using Deckard&apos;s gun, and the two return to Deckard&apos;s apartment, where he promises not to hunt Rachael. Later they share an intimate moment; Rachael then tries to leave, but Deckard seduces her. Arriving at Sebastian&apos;s apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic disorder that accelerates his aging, his life will also be cut short. Under a pretext, Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell&apos;s secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Told that this has proved to be impossible, Roy confesses that he has done &quot; questionable things &quot;. Tyrell dismisses Roy&apos;s guilt, praising Roy&apos;s advanced design and his accomplishments. Responding &quot; Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn&apos;t let you into heaven for &quot;, Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who rides the elevator down alone. [ In The Final Cut &quot;, Deckard is told by Bryant that Sebastian&apos;s body was found at the apartment, but this is left unsaid in other versions. Sebastian&apos;s death was never shot because of concerns over too much violence in the film. Sammon, p. 175 nb ] Upon entering Sebastian&apos;s apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but manages to kill her just as Roy returns. Roy fights Deckard without using his full strength against him. Eventually Deckard is hanging from a rooftop. Just as he is about to fall, Roy saves him. His life ending, Roy delivers a monologue on how his memories are about to be lost and dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and, referring to Rachael, shouts to Deckard &quot; It&apos;s too bad she won&apos;t live, but then again, who does? &quot; Deckard returns to his apartment to find Rachael alive and sleeping in his bed; as they leave, Deckard finds a small tin-foil unicorn, a calling card left by his origami -making partner Gaff. Depending on the version, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape. [ Technology ] [ Spinner ] Screenshot of police spinners flying above Los Angeles &quot; Spinner &quot; is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A Spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using jet propulsion much like Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses. { Sammon, pp. 79–80 } The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an &quot; aerodyne &quot; – a vehicle which directs air downward to create lift, though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: &quot; conventional internal combustion, jet, and anti-gravity &quot;.

The Voight-Kampff is a polygraph -like machine used by Blade Runners to assist in the testing of an individual to determine if they are a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, &quot; blush response &quot;, heart rate, and eye movement in response to emotionally provocative questions. { Sammon, pp. 106–107 } In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes &quot; six or seven &quot; questions to make a determination. In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine if Rachael is a replicant.

[ Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner Blade Runner: The Final CutDVD Warner Bros. 2007 ] Director Ridley Scott and the film&apos;s producers &quot; spent months &quot; meeting and discussing the role with Dustin Hoffman, who eventually departed over differences in vision. Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the Star Wars films, Ford&apos;s interest in the story of Blade Runner, and discussions with Steven Spielberg who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark at the time and strongly praised Ford&apos;s work in the film. According to production documents, a long list of actors were considered for the role, including Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Al Pacino, and Burt Reynolds. Coming off the success of Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth. After Steven Spielberg praised Ford, he was hired for Blade Runner. In 1992, Ford revealed, &quot; Blade Runner is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley. &quot; { Sammon, p. 211 } Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: &quot; When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a f**king [sic] nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director&apos;s interests. &quot; [ July 5, 2007 http://www.moono.com/news/news05091.html Ford: &quot; &apos;Blade Runner&apos; &quot; Was a Nightmare &quot; Moono.com July 27, 2011 ] &quot; I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it. &quot; { Sammon, p. 296 } In 2006 Scott was asked &quot; Who&apos;s the biggest pain in the arse you&apos;ve ever worked with? &quot;, he replied: &quot; It&apos;s got to be Harrison  ... he&apos;ll forgive me because now I get on with him.

[ Smith Neil The Total Film Interview Total Film Summer 2007 130 ] The film also used a number of then less well-known actors such as Daryl Hannah and Sean Young. { Sammon, pp. 92–93 } Casting their roles of Pris and Rachael was also challenging, and a lengthy series of screen tests, with Morgan Paull playing the role of Deckard, were filmed with numerous actresses auditioning. Paull was cast as Deckard&apos;s fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests. Among the actresses tested for the role of Rachael was Nina Axelrod, who was Paull&apos;s recommendation. Stacey Nelkin tried out for Pris but was instead given another role in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming. Both Axelrod&apos;s and Nelkin&apos;s screen tests are featured in the 2007 documentary Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner. Young was picked to play Rachael, Tyrell&apos;s assistant, a replicant with memories that belonged to Tyrell&apos;s niece. Hannah played Pris, a &quot; basic pleasure model &quot; replicant, and the development of her relationship with Roy Batty is shown as a symbol of the replicants&apos; underlying humanity. One role that was not difficult to cast was Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants.

J.  F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions, { Bukatman, p. 72 } and shares their shorter lifespan because he has &quot; Methuselah Syndrome &quot;, a genetic disease resembling progeria that causes faster aging. { Sammon, p. 170 } Joe Pantoliano, who later played the role of Cypher in The Matrix, was considered for the role.

Dick &apos;s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese was interested in filming the novel, but never optioned it. { Bukatman, p. 13; Sammon, p. 23 } Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb&apos;s son Robert: &quot; Jaffe&apos;s screenplay was so terribly done  ... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, &apos;Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?&apos; &quot; { Dick quoted in Sammon, p. 23 } The screenplay by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977. { Sammon, pp. 23–30 } Producer Michael Deeley became interested in Fancher&apos;s draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother&apos;s recent death. { Sammon, pp. 43–49 } He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US$13  million to $15  million. Fancher&apos;s script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and faith, which had featured heavily in the novel and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S. Burroughs for Alan E. Nourse &apos;s novel The Bladerunner (1974), entitled Blade Runner (a movie). [ Some editions of Nourse&apos;s novel use the two-word spacing Blade Runner, as does the Burroughs book. nb ] Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles. Eventually he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites. { Sammon, pp. 49–63 } Having invested over $2.5  million in pre-production, { Sammon, p. 49 } as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5  million in financing through a three-way deal between The Ladd Company (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer Sir Run Run Shaw, and Tandem Productions. { Bukatman, pp. 18–19; Sammon, pp. 64–67 } { Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, Seattle) } Philip K. Dick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film&apos;s production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood. { Sammon, pp. 63–64 } After Dick criticized an early version of Hampton Fancher&apos;s script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the David Peoples rewrite. { Sammon, pp. 67–69 } Although Dick died shortly before the film&apos;s release, he was pleased with the rewritten script, and with a twenty minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Ridley Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it. { Sammon, p. 284 } He said, &quot; I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull &apos;s special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly. &quot; He also approved of the film&apos;s script, saying, &quot; After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it.

The dark and shadowy elements of film-noir cinematography are clearly visible. Although Blade Runner is ostensibly an action film, it operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels.

This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the retrofitted future of Blade Runner, which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and old elsewhere. Ridley Scott described the film as: &quot; extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel &quot;, in an interview by Lynn Barber for The Observer (London) in 2002. Scott &quot; liked the idea of exploring pain &quot; in the wake of his brother&apos;s skin cancer death: &quot; When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me. &quot; An aura of paranoia suffuses the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored—especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories. Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale, hand in hand with the absence of any natural life, with artificial animals substituting for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extra-terrestrial ( &quot; off-world &quot; ) colonies.

The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is human, and forces the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.

Vangelis, fresh from his Academy Award winning score for Chariots of Fire, [ Blade Runner - Scoring the music http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/bladerunner/index.htm Nemo Studios July 27, 2011 ] composed and performed the music on his synthesizers. { Sammon, pp. 271–274 } He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator Demis Roussos. { Sammon, pp. 419–423 } Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo &quot; Love Theme &quot; by British saxophonist Dick Morrissey, who appeared on many of Vangelis&apos; albums. Ridley Scott also used &quot; Memories of Green &quot; from Vangelis&apos; album See You Later (an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film Someone to Watch Over Me ). [ Larsen Peter Film music Reaktion Books London 2007 978-1-86189-341-3 179 ] Along with Vangelis&apos; compositions and ambient textures, the film&apos;s sound scape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia ( &quot; Ogi No Mato &quot; or &quot; The Folding Fan as a Target &quot; from the Nonesuch Records release Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music) and a track by harpist Gail Laughton ( &quot; Harps of the Ancient Temples &quot; from Laurel Records). { Sammon, p. 424 } Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would in 1989 surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director&apos;s Cut version would a substantial amount of the film&apos;s score see commercial release. These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many bootleg recording s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 &quot; Off World Music, Ltd. &quot; created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis&apos; official CD in 1994. A set with three CDs of Blade Runner-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled Blade Runner Trilogy, the first CD contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second CD contains previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third CD is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.

The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the test previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version.

A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the Domestic Cut but contained three extra scenes. { Sammon, pp. 306 and 309–311 } The releases seen by most cinema audiences were: the U.S. theatrical version (1982, 116 minutes), known as the original version or Domestic Cut, released on Betamax and VHS in 1983 and Laserdisc in 1987; the International Cut (1982, 117 minutes), also known as the &quot; Criterion Edition &quot; or &quot; uncut version &quot;, which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S., and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases, it was later released on VHS and Criterion Collection Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a &quot; 10th Anniversary Edition &quot;. { Sammon, pp. 326–329 } The U.S. broadcast version (1986, 114 minutes) was the U.S. theatrical version edited by CBS to tone down the violence, profanity, and nudity to meet broadcasting restrictions. { Sammon, pp. 407–408 and 432 } The Ridley Scott-approved (1991, 116 minutes) Director&apos;s Cut was prompted by the unauthorized 1990/1991 workprint theatrical release. This Director&apos;s Cut was made available on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997. Significant changes from the theatrical version include: the removal of Deckard&apos;s voice-over; re-insertion of a unicorn sequence; and removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the Director&apos;s Cut. { Sammon, pp. 353, 365 } Ridley Scott&apos;s The Final Cut (2007, 117 minutes), or the &quot; 25th Anniversary Edition &quot;, was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc in December 2007. This is the only version over which Ridley Scott had complete artistic control, as he was not directly in charge of the Director&apos;s Cut. In conjunction with the Final Cut cinema release, extensive documentary and other materials were produced for the DVD releases which culminated in a five-disc &quot; Ultimate Collector&apos;s Edition &quot; release by Charles de Lauzirika. [ Derivative works ] [ Novelization ] Philip K. Dick refused an offer of $400,000 to write a novelization of the Blade Runner screenplay, saying: &quot; [I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience &quot; and &quot; [it] would have probably been disastrous to me artistically. &quot; He added, &quot; That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization—they were just furious.
