Within the East Village are several smaller neighborhoods, including Alphabet City and the Bowery. The area was once generally considered to be part of the Lower East Side, but began to develop its own identity and culture in the late 1960s, when many artists, musicians, students and hippie s began to move into the area, attracted by cheap rents and the base of Beatniks who had lived there since the 1950s. The neighborhood has become a center of the counterculture in New York, and is known as the birthplace and historical home of many artistic movements, including punk rock { In Rocking East Village, The Beat Never Stops, Karen Schoemer, The New York Times, June 8, 1990. } and the Nuyorican literary movement. { Another Nuyorican Icon Fades, Santiago Nieves, New York Latino Journal, May 13, 2005. } It has also been the site of protests and riots. The East Village is still known for its diverse community, vibrant nightlife and artistic sensibility, although in recent decades gentrification has changed the character of the neighborhood somewhat. { Kugel, Seth, &quot; An 80-Block Slice of City Life &quot;, } { The New York Times, September 19, 2007. } { TOC } { East 6th Street down } { Second Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares through the East Village } { East 5th Street between } { Second Avenue and } { Cooper Square is a typical side street in the heart of the East Village } [ Boundaries ] Definitions vary, { Neighborhoods in New York City do not have official status, and their boundaries are not specifically set by the city.

Petrus Stuyvesant received the deed to this farm in 1651, and his family held on to the land for over seven generations, until a descendant began selling off parcels of the property in the early 19th century. Wealthy townhouses dotted the dirt roads for a few decades until the great Irish and German immigration of the 1840s and 1850s. Speculative land owners began building multi-unit dwellings on lots meant for single family homes, and began renting out rooms and apartments to the growing working class, including many immigrants from Germany. From roughly the 1850s to first decade of the 20th century, the neighborhood has the third largest urban population of Germans outside of Vienna and Berlin, known as Klein Deutschland ( &quot; Little Germany &quot; ). It was America&apos;s first foreign language neighborhood; hundreds of political, social, sports and recreational clubs were set up during this period, some of these buildings still exist. However, the vitality of the community was sapped by the General Slocum disaster on June 15, 1904, in which over a thousand German-American died. Later waves of immigration also brough many Poles and, especially, Ukrainians to the area. Since the 1890s there has been a large concentration roughly from 10th Street to 5th Street, between 3rd Avenue and Avenue A. The post-World War II diaspora, consisting primarily of Western Ukrainian intelligentsia, also settled down in the area. Several churches, including St. George&apos;s Catholic Church; Ukrainian restaurants and butcher shops; The Ukrainian Museum; the Shevchenko Scientific Society; and the Ukrainian Cultural Center are evidence of the impact of this culture on the area. The area originally ended at the East River, to the east of where Avenue D is now located, until landfill – including World War II debris and rubble shipped from London – was used to extend the shoreline outward to provide foundation for the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. { Paths of Resistance in the East Village, John Strausbaugh, } { The New York Times, September 14, 2007; accessed August 25, 2008. } [ New neighborhood ] Until the mid-1960s, the area was simply the northern part of the Lower East Side, with a similar culture of immigrant, working class life. In the 1950s the migration of Beatnik s into the neighborhood later attracted hippies, musicians and artists well into 1960s. The area was dubbed the &quot; East Village &quot;, to dissociate it from the image of slums evoked by the Lower East Side. According to The New York Times, a 1964 guide called Earl Wilson&apos;s New York wrote that &quot; artists, poets and promoters of coffeehouses from Greenwich Village are trying to remelt the neighborhood under the high-sounding name of &apos;East Village.&apos; &quot; Newcomers and real estate brokers popularized the new name, and the term was adopted by the popular media by the mid-1960s.

On June 27, 1967, the Electric Circus opened in the same space with a benefit for the Children&apos;s Recreation Foundation whose chairman was Bobby Kennedy. The Grateful Dead, The Chambers Brothers, Sly and the Family Stone and the Allman Brothers were among the many rock bands that performed there before it closed in 1971. On March 8, 1968 Bill Graham opened the Fillmore East in what had been a Yiddish Theatre on Second Avenue at East 6th Street. The venue quickly became known as &quot; The Church of Rock and Roll &quot;, with two-show concerts several nights a week. While booking many of the same bands that had played the Electric Circus, Graham particularly used the venue—and its West Coast counterpart—to establish in the US British bands such as The Who, Pink Floyd, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cream and Led Zeppelin. The Fillmore East also closed in 1971. CBGB, the nightclub considered by some to be the birthplace of punk music, was located in the neighborhood, as was the early punk standby A7. No Wave and New York hardcore also emerged in the area&apos;s clubs. Among the many important bands and singers who got their start at these clubs and other venues in downtown Manhattan were Patti Smith, Arto Lindsay, the Ramones, Blondie, Madonna, Talking Heads, Television, the Plasmatics, Glenn Danzig, Sonic Youth, the Beastie Boys, Anthrax, and The Strokes. Some icons of the punk scene remained in the neighborhood as it changed. Richard Hell lives in the same apartment he has lived in since the 1970s, and Handsome Dick Manitoba of The Dictators owns Manitoba&apos;s bar on Avenue B. { Murray Hill with the &quot; Downtown Legends &quot; wall at Mo Pitkins House of Satisfaction, depicting artists of the East Village performance scene, including the } { Reverend Jen, } { Nick Zedd, } { Allen Ginsberg, } { Reverend Billy } [ Art scene ] Over the last 100 years, the East Village and the Lower East Side have contributed significantly to American arts and culture in New York. { Carlo McCormick, &quot; The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984 &quot;, Princeton University Press, 2006 } The neighborhood has been the birthplace of cultural icons and movements from the American gangster to the Warhol Superstar s, folk music to punk rock, anti-folk to hip-hop, advanced education to organized activism, experimental theater to the Beat Generation and the community of experimental musicians, composers and improvisers now loosely known as the Downtown Scene. Club 57, on St. Marks Place, was an important incubator for performance art and visual art in the late 1970s and early 1980s; followed by Now Gallery, 8BC and ABC No Rio. During the 1980s the East Village art gallery scene helped to galvanize a new post-modern art in America; showing such artists as Kiki Smith, Peter Halley, Keith Haring, Stephen Lack, Greer Lankton, Joseph Nechvatal, Nan Goldin, Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Wojnarowicz, James Romberger and Jeff Koons. [ Decline ] The East Village&apos;s performance and art scene has declined since its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s. { Haber, John. &quot; East Village USA &quot; } One club that had opened to try to resurrect the neighborhood&apos;s past artistic prominence was Mo Pitkins&apos; House of Satisfaction, part-owned by Jimmy Fallon of Saturday Night Live. It closed its doors in 2007, and was seen by many as another sign of the continued decline of the East Village performance and art scene, which has shifted in part to Williamsburg in Brooklyn. { E. Village Club Faces Curtains, Paula Froehlich, New York Post, September 5, 2007 } Rapture Cafe also shut down in April 2008, and the neighborhood lost an important performance space and gathering ground for the gay community. There are still some performance spaces, such as Sidewalk Cafe on Avenue A, where downtown acts find space to exhibit their talent, and the poetry clubs. { Rapture Cafe: Coffee is the New Vodka, Mikal Saint George, Trigger Magazine, May 8, 2007. } { St. Nicholas with parts of Second Street visible. The church and almost all buildings on the street were demolished in the 1960s and replaced with parking lots } From 2004 until 2009, the art gallery American Painting, located on East 6th St., between 2nd and 3rd Avenues, exhibited the works of several New York and American artists, namely, Andrei Kushnir, Michele Martin Taylor, Carol Spils, Barbara Nuss, Joachim Marx, Stevens Jay Carter and Michael Francis. One of their last exhibits, &quot; East Village Afternoon, &quot; depicted local interiors, exteriors, and scenes of the changing neighborhood. { &quot; East Village Afternoon &quot; on Vanishing New York } [ Rent ] The East Village is the setting for Jonathan Larson &apos;s musical Rent, which captures the neighborhood in the early 1990s; it opened at the New York Theater Workshop in February 1996. { From Grit to Gloss, Richard Perez, } { The New York Times, November 13, 2005; access August 25, 2008. } Rent describes a city devastated by the AIDS epidemic, drugs and high crime, and follows several characters in their efforts to make livings as artists. { Bohemia Takes its Final Bow, Campbell Robertson, } { The New York Times, July 18, 2008; accessed August 25, 2008. } [ Gentrification ] As has often been the pattern in Manhattan, a neighborhood that is &quot; discovered &quot; by artists and bohemians and then becomes &quot; hip &quot;, will often begin to attract more affluent residents, which drives up the price of housing, and begins to drive out some of the very people who &quot; turned over &quot; the neighborhood. This process, called gentrification, has occurred in SoHo, TriBeCa and Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Over the course of time, it begins to change the essential character of the neighborhood, which becomes safer, more comfortable and less &quot; edgy &quot;. [ Preservation ] Many local community groups actively worked and are working to gain individual and district landmark designations for the East Village to preserve and protect the architectural and cultural identity of the neighborhood. One such group is the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. They have undertaken a complete survey of the East Village, documenting the history of every single building in the area. { &quot; East Village &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } This information will be made public in the spring of 2012. In the spring of 2011 the Landmarks Preservation Commission proposed two East Village Historic Districts, one small district covering the block of East 10th Street known as Tompkins Square North and one larger district focused around lower Second Avenue that would encompass 15 blocks and 330 buildings. { &quot; East Village Preservation &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } The original proposal for the larger district excluded buildings such as the Pyramid Club and the Russian Orthodox Cathedral on East 2nd Street. Thanks to efforts made by local community groups such as the Lower East Side Preservation Initiative, East Village Community Coalition, Historic Districts Council, and Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, however, the proposed district now includes these worthy buildings. { &quot; Editing the East Village &quot; on the } { Villager website } The larger district is calendared to go up before the entire Landmarks Preservation Commission, but a hearing has yet to be scheduled. In January 2012, the East 10th Street Historic District was declared an official New York City Landmark District. Unfortunately, just minutes before the designation, an out-of-scale rooftop addition on one of the included buildings was approved by the Department of Buildings. { &quot; Designation of Historic District in East Village Won’t Stop Project &quot; on the } { New York Times website } Some of the individual sites that are already protected by landmark status are: PS 64/Old Charas Cultural Center, { &quot; PS 64/Old Charas Cultural Center &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } the former Yiddish Art Theater, { &quot; Yiddish Arts Theater &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } Webster Hall, which was designated a New York City landmark on March 18, 2008, { &quot; Webster Hall &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } and Stuyvesant Polyclinic, one of the East Village&apos;s earliest designated landmarks. { &quot; Stuyvesant Polyclinic &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } Some specific sites that are still in need of landmark designation are: the Russian Orthodox Cathedral, { &quot; Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Virgin Protection &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } 101 Avenue A, the current home of the Pyramid Club, { &quot; 101 Avenue A &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } 128 East 13th Street, a former horse auction market and home to Frank Stella&apos;s studio, { &quot; 128 East 13th Street — Saving the former Frank Stella Studios / Horse Auction Mart &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } the 170-year old rowhouses at 326-328 East 4th Street, { &quot; 326-328 East 4th Street &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } and the Congregation Mezritch Synagogue, the East Village&apos;s last operating tenement synagogue. { &quot; Congregation Mezritch &quot; on the } { Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation website } Yiddish Art Theater Webster Hall Stuyvesant Polyclinic (right) 128 East 13th Street [ New York University ] Along with gentrification, the East Village has seen an increase in the number of buildings owned and maintained by New York University, particularly dormitories for undergraduate students, and this influx has given rise to conflict between the community and the university. { As NYU plans towering dorm for 12th Street, East Village neighbors cry foul, Kristen Lombardi, The Village Voice, February 28, 2006. } St. Ann&apos;s Church, a rusticated-stone structure with a Romanesque tower on East 12th Street that dated to 1847, was sold to NYU to make way for a 26-story, 700 bed dormitory. After community protest about the destruction of the church, the university promised to protect and maintain the original facade, which it did, literally by having it stand alone in front of the new building, which is the tallest structure in the area. NYU&apos;s destruction or purchasing of many historic buildings, such as the Peter Cooper Post Office, have made it symbolic of change that many long-time residents fear is destroying what made the neighborhood interesting and attractive. { Residents wary of changing physical, socio-economic landscape, Katla McGlynn, Pace Press, February 6, 2008. } NYU has often been at odds with residents of both the East and West Villages; urban preservationist Jane Jacobs battled the school in the 1960s. { A Lightning Rod at 91, Frances Morrone, } { New York Sun, April 10, 2008. } &quot; She spoke of how universities and hospitals often had a special kind of hubris reflected in the fact that they often thought it was OK to destroy a neighborhood to suit their needs, &quot; said Andrew Berman of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. { Zimmer, Amy. &quot; Activists ask: WWJD? &quot; Metro (April 16, 2008) } [ Cooper Union ] The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, founded in 1859 by entrepreneur and philanthropist Peter Cooper and located on Cooper Square, is one of the most selective colleges in the world, with tuition-free programs in engineering, art and architecture. Its Great Hall is famous as a platform for historic speeches, notably Abraham Lincoln &apos;s Cooper Union speech and its New Academic Building is the first in New York City to achieve LEED Platinum Status. [ Neighborhoods ] { Loisaida street fair in the Summer of 2008. } St. Marks Place is a major shopping street, with many businesses that cater to the tourist trade { gentrification continues } The East Village contains several smaller vibrant communities, each with their own character. [ Alphabet City ] [ Alphabet City, Manhattan ] Alphabet City comprises nearly two-thirds of the East Village, and was once the archetype of a dangerous New York City neighborhood. Its turn-around was cause for The New York Times to observe in 2005 that Alphabet City went &quot; from a drug-infested no man&apos;s land to the epicenter of downtown cool. &quot; { The Final Frontier, for Now, Jennifer Bleyer, March 13, 2005; accessed August 27, 2008. } Its name comes from Avenues A, B, C, and D, the only avenues in Manhattan to have single-letter names. It is bordered by Houston Street to the south and 14th Street to the north. Some landmarks with Alphabet City include Tompkins Square Park and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. [ Loisaida ] [ Loisaida ] Loisaida is a term derived from the Latino, and especially Nuyorican, pronunciation of &quot; Lower East Side &quot;. The term was originally coined by poet/activist, Bittman &quot; Bimbo &quot; Rivas in his 1974 poem &quot; Loisaida &quot;. Loisaida Avenue is now an alternative name for Avenue C in the Alphabet City neighborhood of New York City, whose population has largely been Hispanic (mainly Nuyorican ) since the late 1960s. During the 1980s many of the old, vacant, tenement buildings in this area became inhabited by squatters.

It once had the cachet of Sutton Place, and was known as a secluded rich enclave in Manhattan, but by the 1850s had become a place for boarding houses and a German immigrant community. { Streetscapes / 19-25 St. Marks Place; The Eclectic Life of a Row of East Village Houses, Christopher Gray, } { The New York Times, November 8, 1998; accessed August 27, 2009. } It is named after St. Mark&apos;s Church in-the-Bowery, which was built on Stuyvesant Street but is now on 10th Street. St. Marks Place once began at the intersection of the Bowery and Stuyvesant Street, but today the street runs from Third Avenue to Avenue A. Japanese street culture and a Japanese expatriate scene forms in the noodle shops and bars that line the street, also home to an aged punk culture and CBGB &apos;s new store.

[ Tompkins Square Park Communist Rally ] [ Tompkins Square Park Communist Rally (1877) ] In July 1877, railroad workers received their second wage cut of the year by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. On July 14, railroad employees in Martinsburg, West Virginia, began what came to be known as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. On July 25, 1877, twenty thousand people gathered in Tompkins Square Park to hear communist orators speak about revolution, the strike, and the policies of President Hayes. All speeches were repeated in German at a second stand, as the neighborhood had such a large German population at that time. David Conroy, Chairman of the Working Man&apos;s Organization in NYC and organizer of the rally, stated that the purpose of the meeting was to harmonize the differences between the strikers and the railroad companies, and to urge the citizen soldiery to refrain from acting against the strikers. Although the rally did not get out of hand, New York City police and National Guardsmen eventually charged the crowd with billy clubs, later claiming that the rally was not being held in a peaceful manner. In the wake of this “riot,” the City, in conjunction with the War Department, established an official city armory program led by the 7th Regiment.

Nearby, on Second Avenue between 2nd and 3rd Streets, is the oldest public cemetery in New York City not affiliated with any religion, the New York Marble Cemetery. { New York Marble Cemetery official site. } It is open the fourth Sunday of every month. { A Hush-Hush Plan for a Not-So-Secret Garden, Gregory Bayer, The New York Times, June 1, 2008; accessed August 26, 2008. } [ Culture ] [ Ethnicity and religion ] According to 2000 census figures provided by the New York City Department of City Planning, which includes the Lower East Side in its calculation, the neighborhood was 35% Asian, 28% non-Hispanic white, 27% Hispanic and 7% black. { 2000 Census Figures, New York City Department of City Planning; accessed August 26, 2008. } On October 9, 1966, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, held the first recorded outdoor chanting session of the Hare Krishna mantra outside of the Indian subcontinent at Tompkins Square Park. { Hare Krishna Tree, New York City Parks Department; accessed August 26, 2008. } This is considered the founding of the Hare Krishna religion in the United States, and the large tree close to the center of the Park is demarcated as a special religious site for Krishna adherents. The late poet Allen Ginsberg, who lived and died in the East Village, attended the ceremony. There are several Roman Catholic churches in the East Village that have fallen victim to financial hardship particularly in the past decade. Unable to maintain their properties, the Roman Catholic Church has shuttered many of them—including St. Mary&apos;s Help of Christians on East 12th Street, as well as St. Ann&apos;s. There has recently been much controversy over St. Brigid&apos;s, the historical parish on Tompkins Square Park. One of the mainstays that remains active is St. Stanislaus, just steps from Tompkins Square Park.
