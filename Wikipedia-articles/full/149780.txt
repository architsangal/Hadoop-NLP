The pro-Israel students say that the Palestinian supporters chanted anti-semitic epithets at them, such as &quot; Hitler should have finished the job. &quot; The pro-Palestinian group say the pro-Israelis started the conflict by calling them terrorists and using epithets such as &quot; camel jockey. &quot; No violence occurred, but campus and city police were called in to defuse the situation. In 1994 a mural depicting Malcolm X was painted on the student union building, commissioned by the Pan-African Student Union and African Student Alliance. The mural&apos;s border contained yellow Stars of David and dollar signs mingled with skulls and crossbones and near the words &quot; African Blood. &quot; The next week, after demonstrations on both sides, the school administration had the mural painted over, and subsequently sand blasted. Two years later a new Malcolm X mural was painted, without the controversial symbols. During the campus protests of 1968-69 to gain an Ethnic Studies program, school President S. I. Hayakawa drew the ire of students by pulling the wires from a loudspeaker so that protesters could no longer be heard.
