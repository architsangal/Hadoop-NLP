[ http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/17/17097.html Lake County QuickFacts 2011-11-05 United States Census Bureau ] Its county seat is Waukegan. [ mdy 6 ] The county is part of the Chicago metropolitan area. According to the 2000 Census, Lake County is the 31st richest county by per capita income. The lakefront communities of Lake Forest and Highland Park are part of the affluent North Shore area. Originally part of McHenry County, the townships composing Lake County were carved out into a separate county in 1839. Naval Station Great Lakes is located in the city of North Chicago in Lake County. It is the United States Navy &apos;s Headquarters Command for training, and the Navy&apos;s only recruit training center. [ History ] [ April 2012 ] { Caspar Ott Cabin, built in 1837, is the oldest structure in Lake County. } Lake County at the time of its creation in 1839 The county, which was primarily unsettled prairie and was still home to its native Potawatomi Indians, was created by the Illinois State Legislature in 1839. At that time, Libertyville, then known as Independence Grove, was the first county seat. In 1841, however, the county&apos;s residents voted to move the county government to Little Fort, now Waukegan, where the commissioners had purchased a section of land from the state. Lake County&apos;s first courthouse was built on part of that land in 1844 and the remainder was sold to pay for the $4,000 construction cost. The county&apos;s first courthouse was used solely for court sessions and the jail, but in 1853, commissioners constructed a building to accommodate county administration offices and house records. When fire damaged the courthouse on October 19, 1875, the county records were saved because they were in the adjacent building. After the fire, proposals were made to move the county seat to Highland Park, Libertyville or another site in central Lake County. The county commissioners, however, decided to rebuild in Waukegan. The east half of the building was reconstructed at a cost of $45,000. In 1895, the first jail building was added to the government complex and a west addition was added to the courthouse in 1922. By 1938, county commissioners saw a need for additional space and approved the addition of a 5th Floor. This courthouse, however, was demolished in 1967 to make room for a new high-rise administration building, which was completed with the addition of the jail in 1969 and courts in 1970. Shortly thereafter, the Lake County Board commissioned the construction of a multi-faceted justice facility and ground was broken in 1986 for the Robert H. Babcox Justice Center, named in memory of Sheriff Babcox, who served as Lake County Sheriff from 1982-1988. The justice center, which houses the county jail, work release program, sheriff&apos;s administration offices and three courtrooms, was finished in 1989 at a cost of $29.6 million. Additional county government facilities have been built or expanded throughout Lake County, including the Coroner&apos;s Office, Health Department/Community Health Center facilities, Division of Transportation, Public Works and Winchester House. Lake County government services extend throughout the county&apos;s [ 470 sqmi km2 ]. The historic Half Day Inn, a tavern/restaurant, was constructed in 1843. This structure, once located at the corner of Milwaukee Avenue and Rte. 45/ Olde Half Day Road, had long been the oldest structure in Lake County (older than the Casper Ott Cabin) until it was demolished in 2007 (in the eyes of some residents unnecessarily) to make way for retail space, condominiums, and a retention pond.
