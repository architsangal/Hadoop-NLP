[ 1916 11 16 y ] { Toledo, Ohio, U.S. } [ 1988 5 18 1916 11 16 y ] { Culver City, California, United States } { Heart attack } { Voice actor } { 1934 –1988 } { Myrtis Martin-Butler (1940s –1988; his death) } { David Butler, Don Butler, Paul Butler and Charles (Chas) Butler } { http://www.dawsbutler.com } Charles Dawson &quot; Daws &quot; Butler (November 16, 1916   – May 18, 1988) was a voice actor originally from Toledo, Ohio. He worked mostly for Hanna-Barbera and originated the voices of many familiar animated cartoon characters, including Yogi Bear, Quick Draw McGraw, Snagglepuss, and Huckleberry Hound. [ Early life and career ] Daws Butler was born on November 16, 1916 in Toledo, Ohio, the only child of Ruth Butler and Charles Allen Butler. The family later moved from Ohio to Oak Park, Chicago, where Butler got interested in impersonating people. { http://www.dawsbutler.com/bio-daws.htm } In 1934, the future voice master started as an impressionist, entering multiple amateur contests and winning most of them. He had entered them, not with the intention of showing his talent but as a personal challenge to overcome his shyness, with success. Nonetheless, Butler won professional engagements at vaudeville theaters. Later he teamed up with fellow performers, Jack Lavin and Willard Ovitz to form the comedy trio The Three Short Waves. The team played in theaters, radio and nightclubs, generating positive reviews from regional critics and audiences. They dissolved when in 1941, Daws Butler joined the U.S. Navy as America entered World War Two. Some time after, he met his wife Myrtis during a wartime function at North Carolina. His first voice work for an animated character came in 1948 at MGM. Tex Avery hired Butler to provide the voice of a British wolf on Little Rural Riding Hood and also narration for several of his cartoons. In many of them, there was a nameless wolf that spoke in a Southern accent and whistled all the time. Butler provided the voice for this wolf. While at MGM, Avery wanted Butler to try to do the voice of Droopy, a character that Bill Thompson regularly voiced. Instead he then told Avery about Don Messick, another voice actor and Butler&apos;s life-long friend. Thus Messick voiced Droopy on several shorts. { A Personal Portrait of My Mentor by Joe Bevilesqua } In 1949, Butler landed a role in a televised puppet show created by former Warner Bros. cartoon director Bob Clampett called Time for Beany. Thirty-three-year-old Butler was teamed up with 23-year-old Stan Freberg, and together they did all the voices of the puppets. Butler voiced Beany Boy and Captain Huffenpuff. Freberg voiced Cecil and Dishonest John. An entire stable of recurring characters were seen. The show&apos;s writers were Charles Shows and Lloyd Turner, whose dependably funny dialog was still always at the mercy of Butler&apos;s and Freberg&apos;s ad lib s. Time for Beany ran from 1949 to 1954 and won several Emmy Award s. It was the basis for the cartoon Beany and Cecil. In Mr. Magoo, the UPA theatrical animated short series for Columbia Pictures, Butler voiced the part of Magoo&apos;s nephew Waldo (also voiced by Jerry Hausner at various times). Butler briefly turned his attention to TV commercials, although he quickly moved to providing the voice to many nameless Walter Lantz characters for theatrical shorts later seen on the Woody Woodpecker program. His notable character was the penguin &quot; Chilly Willy &quot; and his sidekick, the southern-speaking dog Smedley (the same voice used for Tex Avery&apos;s laid-back wolf character). Also in the 1950s, Stan Freberg asked Butler to help him write comedy skits for his Capitol Records albums. Their first collaboration, &quot; St. George and the Dragon-Net &quot; (based on Dragnet ), was the first comedy record to sell over one million copies. Freberg was more of a satirist who did song parodies, but the bulk of his &quot; talking &quot; routines were co-written by, and co-starred, Daws Butler. Butler also teamed up again with Freberg and cartoon actress June Foray in a short-lived network radio series, The Stan Freberg Show, which ran from July to October 1957 on the CBS Radio Network. Freberg&apos;s box-set, Tip of the Freberg ( Rhino Entertainment, 1999) chronicles every aspect of Freberg&apos;s career except the cartoon voice-over work, and it showcases his career with Daws Butler. In 1957, MGM closed their animation division, and producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera found themselves unemployed. They quickly formed their own company, and Daws Butler and Don Messick were on-hand to provide voices. The first, The Ruff &amp; Reddy Show, set the formula for the rest of the series of cartoons that the two would helm until the mid-1960s.

The breakfast cereal mascot Cap&apos;n Crunch became an icon of sorts on Saturday morning TV through many commercials produced by Jay Ward. Butler gave voice to the Cap&apos;n from the 1960s to the 1980s. He based the voice on that of character actor Charles Butterworth. When in 1961, Mel Blanc was recovering from a motor vehicle accident, Daws Butler stepped in to voice Barney Rubble in five episodes of The Flintstones (The Hit Songwriter, Droop-Along Flintstone, Fred Flintstone Woos Again, The Rock Quarry Story, The Little White Lie). In the 1970s he was the voice of &quot; Hair Bear &quot; on Help!... It&apos;s the Hair Bear Bunch! and a few characters in minor cartoons such as C.B. Bears. On Wacky Races, Butler provided the voices for a number of the racers, notably Rock Slag, Big Gruesome, the Red Max, Sgt. Blast, Peter Perfect, and Rufus Ruffcut. On Laff-a-Lympics, Butler was virtually the entire &quot; Yogi Yahooey &quot; team. He voiced a penguin and a turtle in the movie Mary Poppins, his only known work for Disney. Along with Stan Freberg, Paul Frees and June Foray, Butler also provided voices for countless children&apos;s records featuring recreations of several successful Disney cartoons and films. [ Inspiration ] Butler based some of his voices on popular celebrities of the day. Yogi Bear began as an Art Carney impression; Butler had done a similar voice in several of Robert McKimson &apos;s films at Warner Brothers and Stan Freberg&apos;s comedy record &quot; The Honey-Earthers. &quot; However, Butler soon changed Yogi&apos;s voice, making it much deeper and more sing-songy, thus making it a more original voice. Hokey Wolf began as an impression of Phil Silvers, and Snagglepuss as Bert Lahr. In fact, when Snagglepuss began appearing in commercials for Kellogg&apos;s Cocoa Krispies in 1961, Lahr threatened to sue Butler for &quot; stealing &quot; his voice. As part of the settlement, the disclaimer &quot; Snagglepuss voice by Daws Butler &quot; was required to appear on each commercial, making him the only voice actor ever to receive one in an animated TV commercial. Again, Butler redesigned these voices, making them his own inventions. Huckleberry Hound was inspired many years earlier, in 1945, by a North Carolina neighbor of Daws&apos; wife&apos;s family, and he had in fact been using that voice for a long time, for Avery&apos;s laid-back wolf and Lantz&apos;s Smedley. [ Later life ] Butler remained somewhat low-key in the 1970s and 1980s, until a 1985 revival of The Jetsons. Also in 1983, he voiced the title character, Wacky WallWalker in Deck the Halls with Wacky Walls. In 1975, Butler began an acting workshop that spawned such talents as Nancy Cartwright ( The Simpsons ), Corey Burton (Old Navy, Disney ), and Joe Bevilacqua ( NPR ). In the year of his death, The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound was released, a tour-de-force featuring most of his classic early characters. [ Personal life and death ] He was married to Myrtis Martin from the 1940s to 1988, whom he had met and married while he was in the United States Navy during World War II. [ http://www.s9.com/Biography/Daws-Butler Daws Butler&apos;s biography on S9.com 2010-09-09 ] They had four sons, David Butler, Don Butler, Paul Butler and Charles Butler. Butler died from a heart attack on May 18, 1988. Many of his roles were assumed by Greg Burson, who had personally studied with Butler for years. [ Legacy ] Daws Butler trained many voice actors including Nancy Cartwright (the voice of Bart Simpson ), Corey Burton (the voice of Dale in Chip &apos;n&apos; Dale ) and Joe Bevilacqua (whom Butler personally taught how to do all of his characters). Butler&apos;s voice and scripts were a frequent part of Bevilacqua&apos;s now-defunct XM show. [ http://comedyorama.com The Comedy-O-Rama Hour Comedyorama.com 2010-09-09 ] Bevilacqua also wrote Butler&apos;s official biography, published by Bear Manor Media. { Daws Butler - Characters Actor, BearManor Media } A new book of cartoon scripts written by Daws Butler and Joe Bevilacqua, Uncle Dunkle and Donnie: Fractured Fables, was scheduled for publication in the fall of 2009. A four-volume, 4½-hour audio set of Uncle Dunkle and Donnie was to be released simultaneously with Bevilacqua performing all 97 characters in 35 stories. Butler also trained Hal Rayle, who ultimately determined that his best-known character of Doyle Cleverlobe from Galaxy High School should sound like Elroy Jetson after he finished puberty. [ http://galaxyhigh86.tripod.com/halrayle.html The Galaxy High Website! Galaxyhigh86.tripod.com 2010-09-09 ] [ Media ] The video Daws Butler: Voice Magician is a 1987 documentary of Butler&apos;s career from his pre-MGM days on up through his teaming with Freberg in 1949 and the teaming with Don Messick in 1957. It was originally seen as a PBS pledge-drive special. Former Butler protege Joe Bevilacqua used to host a radio series on XM Satellite Radio&apos;s Sonic Theater Channel called The Comedy-O-Rama Hour which features a regular segment called What the Butler Wrote: Scenes from the Daws Butler Workshop with rare scripts of Daws performed by his students, including Nancy Cartwright, and rare recordings of Daws himself. Bevilacqua has also co-authored (with Ben Ohmart) the authorized biography book Daws Butler, Characters Actor, and edited the book Scenes for Actors and Voices written by Daws Butler, both published by Bear Manor Media. Butler once appeared as a contestant on Groucho Marx &apos;s You Bet Your Life. The studio audience did not recognize him until he began doing Huckleberry Hound&apos;s voice. Butler and his partner split the top prize of $10,000. In 1985, Daws Butler was interviewed about his career on radio by Dr. Demento.
