Larne_coat_of_arms.png Larne Coat of Arms Northern Ireland 54.851 -5.811 30 18,228 ( 2001 Census ) D4102 Larne Northern Ireland LARNE BT BT40 028 East Antrim East Antrim County Antrim ] Larne ( [ Latharna ], the name of a Gaelic territory) { Placenames Database of Ireland } is a substantial seaport and industrial market town on the east coast of County Antrim, Northern Ireland with a population of 18,228 people in the 2001 Census. As of 2011, there are about 31,000 residents in the greater Larne area. It has been used as a seaport for over 1,000 years, and is today a major passenger and freight roll-on roll-off port. Larne is twinned with Clover, South Carolina. Larne is administered by Larne Borough Council. Together with the neighbouring district of Carrickfergus and part of Newtownabbey, it forms the East Antrim constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly. [ History ] { Standing stone near } { Cairncastle. } { The } coastal area around Larne has been inhabited for millennia, and it thought to have been one of the earliest inhabited areas of Ireland, with these early human populations believed to have arrived from Scotland via the North Channel. The early coastal dwellers are thought to have had a sophisticated culture which involved trading between the shores of the North Channel and between other settlements on the coasts of Scotland. Archaeological digs in the area have found flint work and other artefacts which have been assigned dates from 6000 BC onwards. The term Larnian has even been coined by archaeologists to describe such flintworks and similar artefacts of the Mesolithic era (and one time to describe Mesolithic culture in Ireland as a whole). { Larne Borough council - Local History and Heritage } { Larnian - Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology } { Larnian industry - Encyclopædia Britannica } The oldest known recorded Irish name for Larne Lough was Loch Ollarbha or Inbhear nOllarbha (Ollarbha Rivermouth), from Ollarbha the ancient name of the Larne Water. It is also recorded that the Roman Emperor Serverus described how, in 204AD, a Roman slave galley bound for Scotland was blown off course and took shelter in a place that they called Portus Saxa (the Port of the Standing Stones ) - this is thought to have been Larne Lough. The ancient Greeks also had knowledge of the Antrim Coast and Ptolemy, the astronomer and geographer of the 2nd century AD, referred to Islandmagee on one of his maps. In mediaeval times Lathar, daughter/son &amp; #91; ? &amp; #93; of Hugony the Great (according to legend, High King of Ireland and reputed ruler of much of the British Isles), was reputedly given a small territory by her/his father which stretched along the Antrim coast roughly from Glenarm to the Inver River - this territory was thus called Latharna (the lands of Lathar). The area where the modern town sits was known in Irish as Inbhear an Latharna (meaning the &quot; river mouth of Latharna &quot; ) and in English as Inver Larne or simply Inver. (The territorial name of &quot; Latharna &quot; was only applied exclusively to the location of the present town in recent centuries.) The area at one point came under threat from Viking raids. Viking burial sites have been found in Larne, and artefacts such as Viking-type swords found in Larne have been dated to the tenth century AD. { Danish Viking Ship Museum - Larne Viking Grave } It is generally thought that the Vikings established a base at Larne for a time, and that the Norse name for Larne Lough was Ulfreksfjord (named after one of their Norse kings). According to Snorri, the Norse historian, Connor, King of Ireland, defeated the raiding Orkney Vikings at Ulfreksfjord in 1018. This suggests that some of Anglo-Norman names for the Larne area, such as Wulfrickford had a Norse origin. In later Anglo-Norman records the name for Larne Lough was spelt as Wulvricheford, Wulfrickford, Wokingisfyrth, Wolderfirth, Wolverflete, Ulderfleet, Ulderfleete and Wulfricchford in various records, eventually settling down to Olderfleet. P.W. Joyce in his Irish Names of Places states that it is probable that in the first element of &quot; Olderfleet &quot; is the ancient Irish name of the Larne water, Ollorbha, with the second element being a corruption of the word &quot; fiord &quot; (a long narrow arm of the sea, running up between high banks or cliffs, as on the coast of Norway ) { Irish Times - Where&apos;s That?/Olderfleet 1365 } { Olderfleet Castle } { In } the 13th Century the Scots-Irish Bissett family built Olderfleet Castle at Curran Point. In 1315 Edward the Bruce of Scotland (brother of Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland) landed at Larne with his 6000 strong army en route to conquer Ireland, where Olderfleet Castle was of strategic importance. Edward saw Ireland as another front in the ongoing war against Norman England. In 1569 Queen Elizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland, appointed Sir Moyses Hill as the governor of Olderfleet Castle. It was seen as strategically important for any Tudor conquest of Ulster. Following the 17th century Union of the Crowns of Scotland, England and Ireland under James VI &amp; I many more settlers would have arrived to Ulster via Larne during the Plantation of Ulster. The area around County Antrim itself, however, was not part of the official 17th century Plantation; instead many Scottish settlers arrived in the area through private settlement in the 17th century (as they had also been doing for centuries before). During the 18th century many Irish emigrated to America from the port of Larne. A monument in the Curran Park commemorates the Friends Goodwill, the first emigrant ship to sail from Larne in May 1717, heading for Boston, New England in the modern United States. Boston&apos;s long standing Irish roots can be traced to Larne. As with western and southern Ireland and unlike some areas of north –east (Antrim, Down, Louth and North Dublin ) and eastern Ireland (South Dublin, Wicklow ) this was a town stricken by the Irish Famine of the mid 19th century. [ March 2007 ] In 1914, Loyalists opposed to the Home Rule Act 1914 prepared for armed resistance. In an episode known as the Larne Gun Running German weapons and ammunition were transported into the port of Larne in the dead of night and distributed throughout Ulster. { A. T. Q. Stewart: &quot; The Ulster Crisis &quot;, London, Faber and Faber Ltd., 1967 SBN 571 08066 9 } This event marked a major step in cementing the right to Ulster Unionist self-determination, with the recognition of such a right ultimately leading to the creation of Northern Ireland. [ The Troubles ] Larne throughout the course of The Troubles had a significant paramilitary presence in the town, mostly through the presence of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA). For further information see UDA South East Antrim Brigade. The town suffered a number of bomb attacks during The Troubles, notably including a large car bomb at the King&apos;s Arms hotel { Report on King&apos;s Arms Hotel bombing } in 1980 that caused damage to the main shopping areas, for which the PIRA claimed responsibility. This incident was raised in Parliament at the time. { Hansard commentary on King&apos;s Arms Hotel bombing being raised in Westminster } [ Geography ] { Islandmagee illustrating the proximity to } { Scotland.

In the background are the Scottish } { Paps of Jura on the left and } { Mull of Kintyre on the right. } Larne sits on the western side of a narrow inlet that links Larne Lough to the sea. On the eastern side of the inlet is a peninsula called Islandmagee. To the west of Larne is the ancient volcanic formation of Antrim Plateau, with its glaciated valleys scenically sweeping down to the sea the to the north of Larne in what are known as the Glens of Antrim. Larne is 25 miles from the Scottish mainland, with stunning views across the North Channel towards the Mull of Kintyre, Rhins of Galloway, Islay and Paps of Jura often visible from the Larne area - this proximity to Scotland has had a defining influence on Larne&apos;s history and culture. The town is within the small parish of the same name. Like the rest of Ireland, this parish has long been divided into townland s, whose names mostly come from the Irish language. Over time, more rural townlands have been built upon and they have given their names to many roads and housing estates. The following is a list of townlands within Larne&apos;s urban area, alongside their likely etymologies : [ http://www.placenamesni.org/Index.html Northern Ireland Placenames Project 2010-06-12 ] Antiville (likely from an Tigh Bhile meaning &quot; the house of the old tree &quot; ) Ballyboley (likely from Baile Buaile meaning &quot; townland of the booley/dairy place &quot; ) Ballycraigy (likely from Baile Creige meaning &quot; townland of the rocky outcrop &quot; ) Ballyloran (likely from Baile Loairn meaning &quot; Loarn&apos;s townland &quot; ) Blackcave North Blackcave South Curran and Drumaliss (likely from Córran meaning &quot; crescent &quot; and Druim a&apos; Lios meaning &quot; ridge of the ringfort &quot; ) Greenland Inver (likely from Inbhear meaning &quot; rivermouth &quot; ) [ Panorama of Antrim Plateau and Antrim Coast from Blackcave area of Larne - geograph.org.uk - 2526485.jpg 900px Panorama of the Antrim Plateau and Antrim Coast from the Blackcave area of Larne.

It was originally a &quot; daughter church &quot; of the parish of St Cedma&apos;s, before being united with St Patrick&apos;s, Cairncastle, to form a new parish grouping. [ First Larne Presbyterian Church ] First Larne Presbyterian Church describes itself &quot; as one of the oldest Presbyterian congregations in Ireland &quot; { First Larne Presbyterian Church Website } on its website. [ Gardenmore Presbyterian Church ] [ Larne Baptist Church ] [ Larne Congregational Church ] Larne Congregational Church is situated on Curran Road This church was founded in 1879 by Rev James Orr, but nothing is recorded about other founding members and nothing is known about Rev Orr except that his time as minister lasted for six years until 1885 and that he had passed away before February 1910 when the new church was built at 38-40 Curran road. Before this there was an old tin/iron building on the Clonlee which was the original meeting place. It was known as the tin tabernacle. After it became unusable due to rust and decay, the church members met at 139 Main street in the town and some meetings were held in Rev Archibald Mackinlay&apos;s home at 20 Clonlee. Around this time (1900 approx) monthly meetings were being held in the Intermediate school at Barnhill. This school was actually the end house in the terrace beside the Orange hall and is now a house again. The new church was opened in 1910 and is still active today.

A freight-only service operates to Heysham. Passenger services are operated by P &amp; O, Stena Line and the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. The P &amp; O ferry company describes the crossings from Larne to Scotland as &quot; the shortest, fastest crossings &quot; P &amp; O Irish Sea due to the close proximity that Larne has to Scotland, and that the fast ferry to Cairnryan takes only one hour. Larne is connected to Belfast by the A8 road. The A2 road or &apos;Antrim coast road&apos; which runs along the Antrim coast, and passes through the scenic Glens of Antrim, also serves the town. South of the town the A2 passes the side of Larne Lough, via Glynn, Magheramorne, and Ballycarry, to Whitehead and Carrickfergus. The A36 road runs from the town to Ballymena. The Belfast–Larne railway line connects to Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station and Belfast Central, via Whitehead and Carrickfergus, also connects Larne to the Northern Ireland Railways network. Currently there is no freight transport by rail in Northern Ireland. Both Larne Town railway station and Larne Harbour railway station opened on 1 October 1862 and closed for goods traffic on 4 January 1965. The Ballymena and Larne Railway was a narrow gauge railway. It opened in 1878, was closed to passengers in 1933 and finally completely closed in 1950. Another line ran from Larne to Ballyclare and some parts of it can still be made out where it ran along the Six Mile valley.
