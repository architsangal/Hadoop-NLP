[ Scifi Sci Fi ] Science fiction is a genre of fiction dealing with imaginary but more or less plausible (or at least non- supernatural ) content such as future settings, futuristic science and technology, space travel, aliens, and paranormal abilities. Exploring the consequences of scientific innovation s is one purpose of science fiction, making it a &quot; literature of ideas &quot;. [ Marg Gilks, Paula Fleming, and Moira Allen Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas WritingWorld.com 2003 http://www.writing-world.com/sf/sf.shtml ] Science fiction is largely based on writing rationally about alternative possible worlds or futures. [ Del Rey Lester The World of Science Fiction: 1926–1976 Ballantine Books 1979 5 0-345-25452-X ] It is similar to, but differs from fantasy in that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). The settings for science fiction are often contrary to known reality, but most science fiction relies on a considerable degree of suspension of disbelief, which is facilitated in the reader&apos;s mind by potential scientific explanations or solutions to various fictional elements. Science fiction elements include: [ Card Orson Scott How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy Writer&apos;s Digest Books 1990 17 0-89879-416-1 ] [ Hartwell David G.

New and different political or social systems (e.g. dystopia, post-scarcity, or a post-apocalyptic situation where organized society has collapsed). Paranormal abilities such as mind control, telepathy, telekinesis, and teleportation. Other universes or dimensions and travel between them. [ Definitions ] [ Definitions of science fiction ] Science fiction is difficult to define, as it includes a wide range of subgenre s and themes. Author and editor Damon Knight summed up the difficulty by stating that &quot; science fiction is what we point to when we say it &quot;, [ Knight Damon Francis In Search of Wonder: Essays on Modern Science Fiction Advent Publishing, Inc. 1967 xiii 0-911682-31-7 ] a definition echoed by author Mark C. Glassy, who argues that the definition of science fiction is like the definition of pornography : you don&apos;t know what it is, but you know it when you see it. [ The Biology of Science Fiction Cinema Glassy Mark C. 2001 McFarland Jefferson, N.C. 0-7864-0998-3 ] Vladimir Nabokov argued that if we were rigorous with our definitions, Shakespeare&apos;s play The Tempest would have to be termed science fiction. [ Nabokov Vladimir Vladimirovich Strong opinions McGraw-Hill 1973 3 et seq 0-07-045737-9 ] According to science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein, &quot; a handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method. &quot; [ Science Fiction: Its Nature, Faults and Virtues The Science Fiction Novel: Imagination and Social Criticism Advent Publishers Heinlein Robert A.

G. Wells } Then with the dawn of new technologies such as electricity, the telegraph, and new forms of powered transportation, writers like Jules Verne and H. G.

[ http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563123_2/Science_Fiction.html Encarta Online Encyclopedia Microsoft Science Fiction 2006 2007-01-17 ] Wells&apos; The War of the Worlds describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians using tripod fighting machines equipped with advanced weaponry. It is a seminal depiction of an alien invasion of Earth. In the late 19th century, the term &quot; scientific romance &quot; was used in Britain to describe much of this fiction. This produced additional offshoots, such as the 1884 novella Flatland : A Romance of Many Dimensions by Edwin Abbott Abbott. The term would continue to be used into the early 20th century for writers such as Olaf Stapledon. { Jules Verne } In the early 20th century, pulp magazine s helped develop a new generation of mainly American SF writers, influenced by Hugo Gernsback, the founder of Amazing Stories magazine. In 1912 Edgar Rice Burroughs published A Princess of Mars, the first of his three-decade-long series of Barsoom novels, situated on Mars and featuring John Carter as the hero. The 1928 publication of Philip Nolan&apos;s original Buck Rogers story, Armageddon 2419, in Amazing Stories was a landmark event. This story led to comic strips featuring Buck Rogers (1929), Brick Bradford (1933), and Flash Gordon (1934). The comic strips and derivative movie serials greatly popularized science fiction. In the late 1930s, John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction, and a critical mass of new writers emerged in New York City in a group called the Futurians, including Isaac Asimov, Damon Knight, Donald A. Wollheim, Frederik Pohl, James Blish, Judith Merril, and others. [ http://jophan.org/mimosa/m21/resnick.htm The Literature of Fandom Resnick Mike Mimosa #21 1997 2007-01-17 ] Other important writers during this period included E.E. (Doc) Smith, Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Olaf Stapledon, A. E. van Vogt and Stanisław Lem. Campbell&apos;s tenure at Astounding is considered to be the beginning of the Golden Age of science fiction, characterized by hard SF stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress. This lasted until postwar technological advances, new magazines like Galaxy under Pohl as editor, and a new generation of writers began writing stories outside the Campbell mode. In the 1950s, the Beat generation included speculative writers like William S. Burroughs. In the 1960s and early 1970s, writers like Frank Herbert, Samuel R. Delany, Roger Zelazny, and Harlan Ellison explored new trends, ideas, and writing styles, while a group of writers, mainly in Britain, became known as the New Wave for their embrace of a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content, and a highbrow and self-consciously &quot; literary &quot; or artistic sensibility. In the 1970s, writers like Larry Niven and Poul Anderson began to redefine hard SF.

[ Innovation ] While SF has provided criticism of developing and future technologies, it also produces innovation and new technology. The discussion of this topic has occurred more in literary and sociological than in scientific forums. Cinema and media theorist Vivian Sobchack examines the dialogue between science fiction film and the technological imagination. Technology impacts artists and how they portray their fictionalized subjects, but the fictional world gives back to science by broadening imagination. While more prevalent in the beginning years of science fiction with writers like Arthur C. Clarke, new authors still find ways to make the currently impossible technologies seem closer to being realized.

Some works may overlap two or more commonly defined genres, whereas others are beyond the generic boundaries, either outside or between categories. Moreover, the categories and genres used by mass markets and literary criticism differ considerably. One example that straddles science fiction subgenres is Elizabeth Moon &apos;s Vatta&apos;s War series, which has been described by many as military science fiction but also has elements of space opera. [ Hard SF ] [ Hard science fiction ] Hard science fiction, or &quot; hard SF &quot;, is characterized by rigorous attention to accurate detail in quantitative sciences, especially physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, or on accurately depicting worlds that more advanced technology may make possible. Many accurate predictions of the future come from the hard science fiction subgenre, but numerous inaccurate predictions have emerged as well.

Peter Lang Publishing (March 1995) ISBN 0-8204-1962-1 } Some writers blur the boundary between hard and soft science fiction. { New World Encyclopedia: Science Fiction } Related to Social SF and Soft SF are the speculative fiction branches of utopian or dystopian stories; George Orwell &apos;s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Aldous Huxley &apos;s Brave New World and Margaret Atwood &apos;s The Handmaid&apos;s Tale, are examples. Satirical novels with fantastic settings such as Gulliver&apos;s Travels by Jonathan Swift may be considered speculative fiction.

Common themes in cyberpunk include advances in information technology and especially the Internet, visually abstracted as cyberspace, artificial intelligence and prosthetics and post-democratic societal control where corporations have more influence than governments. Nihilism, post-modernism, and film noir techniques are common elements, and the protagonists may be disaffected or reluctant anti-hero es. Noteworthy authors in this genre are William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and Pat Cadigan. James O&apos;Ehley has called the 1982 film Blade Runner a definitive example of the cyberpunk visual style.

The first major time travel novel was Mark Twain &apos;s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&apos;s Court. The most famous is H. G. Wells &apos;s 1895 novel The Time Machine, which uses a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively, while Twain&apos;s time traveler is struck in the head. The term &quot; time machine &quot;, coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle. Stories of this type are complicated by logical problems such as the grandfather paradox. [ http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/ Time Travel and Modern Physics Frank Artzenius and Tim Maudlin Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2000-02-17 2007-01-16 ] Time travel continues to be a popular subject in modern science fiction, in print, movies, and television such as the BBC television series Doctor Who. [ Alternate history ] [ Alternate history ] Alternate (or alternative) history stories are based on the premise that historical events might have turned out differently. These stories may use time travel to change the past, or may simply set a story in a universe with a different history from our own. Classics in the genre include Bring the Jubilee by Ward Moore, in which the South wins the American Civil War, and The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick, in which Germany and Japan win World War II. The Sidewise Award acknowledges the best works in this subgenre; the name is taken from Murray Leinster &apos;s 1934 story &quot; Sidewise in Time. &quot; Harry Turtledove is one of the most prominent authors in the subgenre and is sometimes called the &quot; master of alternate history &quot;.

Stories include detail about military technology, procedure, ritual, and history; military stories may use parallels with historical conflicts. Heinlein&apos;s Starship Troopers is an early example, along with the Dorsai novels of Gordon Dickson. Joe Haldeman &apos;s The Forever War is a critique of the genre, a Vietnam -era response to the World War II–style stories of earlier authors.

[ http://www.baen.com/intweis.htm Website Interview with Toni Weisskopf on SF Canada Baen Books 2005-09-12 2007-01-16 ] [ Superhuman ] Superhuman stories deal with the emergence of humans who have abilities beyond the norm. This can stem either from natural causes such as in Olaf Stapledon &apos;s novel Odd John, and Theodore Sturgeon &apos;s More Than Human, or be the result of intentional augmentation such as in A.  E. van Vogt &apos;s novel Slan. These stories usually focus on the alienation that these beings feel as well as society&apos;s reaction to them. These stories have played a role in the real life discussion of human enhancement. Frederik Pohl &apos;s Man Plus also belongs to this category. [ Apocalyptic ] [ Apocalyptic fiction ] Apocalyptic fiction is concerned with the end of civilization through war ( On the Beach ), pandemic ( The Last Man ), astronomic impact ( When Worlds Collide ), ecological disaster ( The Wind from Nowhere ), or some other general disaster or with a world or civilization after such a disaster. Typical of the genre are George R. Stewart &apos;s novel Earth Abides and Pat Frank &apos;s novel Alas, Babylon. Apocalyptic fiction generally concerns the disaster itself and the direct aftermath, while post-apocalyptic can deal with anything from the near aftermath (as in Cormac McCarthy &apos;s The Road ) to 375 years in the future (as in By The Waters of Babylon) to hundreds or thousands of years in the future, as in Russell Hoban &apos;s novel Riddley Walker and Walter M. Miller, Jr. &apos;s A Canticle for Leibowitz. [ Space opera ] [ Space opera ] Space opera is adventure science fiction set in outer space or on distant planets. The conflict is heroic, and typically on a large scale. Space opera is sometimes used pejoratively, to describe improbable plots, absurd science, and cardboard characters. But it is also used nostalgically, and modern space opera may be an attempt to recapture the sense of wonder of the golden age of science fiction. The pioneer of this subgenre is generally recognized to be Edward E. (Doc) Smith, with his Skylark and Lensman series. The Star Trek television series franchise is often described as space opera that encourages this sense of wonder, in that most of the scripts are generally about peaceful space exploration and examinations of cultural differences rather than about conflict between civilizations. Alastair Reynolds &apos;s Revelation Space series, Peter F. Hamilton &apos;s Void, Night&apos;s Dawn and Pandora&apos;s Star series, and Vernor Vinge &apos;s A Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky are newer examples of this genre. [ Space Western ] [ Space western ] Space Western could be considered a sub-genre of space opera that transposes themes of the American Western books and film to a backdrop of futuristic space frontiers. These stories typically involve &quot; frontier &quot; colony worlds (colonies that have only recently been terraformed and/or settled) serving as stand-ins for the backdrop of lawlessness and economic expansion that were predominant in the American west. Examples include the Sean Connery film Outland, the Firefly television series, and the film sequel Serenity by Joss Whedon, as well as the manga and anime series Trigun, Outlaw Star, and Cowboy Bebop. [ Other sub-genres ] [ June 2008 ] [ Do Metaphors Dream of Literal Sleep? A Science-Fictional Theory of Representation Seo-Young Chu Harvard University Press 2011 0-674-05517-9 ] Anthropological science fiction is a sub-genre that absorbs and discusses anthropology and the study of human kind. Examples include Hominids by Robert J. Sawyer, and &apos;&apos;Neanderthal&apos;&apos; by John Darnton. Biopunk focuses on biotechnology and subversives. Comic science fiction is a sub-genre that exploits the genre&apos;s conventions for comic effect. Feminist science fiction poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, the role reproduction plays in defining gender and the unequal political and personal power of men and women. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopia s to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopia s to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue. Elyce Rae Helford, in Westfahl, Gary. The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Greenwood Press, 2005: 289-290 Joanna Russ &apos;s work, and some of Ursula Le Guin&apos;s work can be thus categorised. Science fiction poetry is an overlooked and under-discussed sub-category of science fiction. As Seo-Young Chu remarks in her 2011 book Do Metaphors Dream of Literal Sleep? A Science-Fictional Theory of Representation, science fiction is not often (enough) thought of as a genre related to lyric poetry. But as Chu points out, there are plenty of examples of science fiction poetry and verse by writers including Diane Ackerman, Emily Dickinson, Suzette Haden Elgin (who founded the Science Fiction Poetry Association and authored The Science Fiction Poetry Handbook), Ruth Fainlight, Robert Frazier, Cathy Park Hong, Andrew Joron, and Frederick Turner, among many others. Chu also points out that lyricism is an overlooked yet overwhelming presence in science fiction novels, stories, and films. Steampunk is based on the idea of futuristic technology existing in the past, usually the 19th century, and often set in Victorian era England—but with prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy, such as fictional technological inventions like those found in the works of H.  G. Wells and Jules Verne, or real technological developments like the computer occurring at an earlier date. Popular examples include The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, as well as the Girl Genius series by Phil and Kaja Foglio, although seeds of the genre may be seen in certain works of Michael Moorcock, Philip Jose Farmer and Steve Stiles, and in such games as Space 1889 and Marcus Rowland&apos;s Forgotten Futures.

[ http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fanfic The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language Houghton Mifflin Company 2003 2007-01-17 ] This modern meaning of the term should not be confused with the traditional (pre-1970s) meaning of &quot; fan fiction &quot; within the community of fandom, where the term meant original or parody fiction written by fans and published in fanzines, often with members of fandom as characters therein ( &quot; faan fiction &quot; ). Examples of this would include the Goon Defective Agency stories, written starting in 1956 by Irish fan John Berry and published in his and Arthur Thomson &apos;s fanzine Retribution. In the last few years, sites have appeared such as Orion&apos;s Arm and Galaxiki, which encourage collaborative development of science fiction universes.

[ Science fiction studies ] [ Science fiction studies ] The study of science fiction, or science fiction studies, is the critical assessment, interpretation, and discussion of science fiction literature, film, new media, fandom, and fan fiction. Science fiction scholars take science fiction as an object of study in order to better understand it and its relationship to science, technology, politics, and culture-at-large. Science fiction studies has a long history dating back to the turn of the 20th century, but it was not until later that science fiction studies solidified as a discipline with the publication of the academic journals Extrapolation (1959), Foundation - The International Review of Science Fiction (1972), and Science Fiction Studies (1973), and the establishment of the oldest organizations devoted to the study of science fiction, the Science Fiction Research Association and the Science Fiction Foundation, in 1970. The field has grown considerably since the 1970s with the establishment of more journals, organizations, and conferences with ties to the science fiction scholarship community, and science fiction degree-granting programs such as those offered by the University of Liverpool and Kansas University. The National Science Foundation has conducted surveys of &quot; Public Attitudes and Public Understanding &quot; of &quot; Science Fiction and Pseudoscience &quot;. { National Science Foundation survey: Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Public Understanding. Science Fiction and Pseudoscience. } They write that &quot; Interest in science fiction may affect the way people think about or relate to science....one study found a strong relationship between preference for science fiction novels and support for the space program...The same study also found that students who read science fiction are much more likely than other students to believe that contacting extraterrestrial civilizations is both possible and desirable (Bainbridge 1982). { Bainbridge, W.S. 1982. &quot; The Impact of Science Fiction on Attitudes Toward Technology. &quot; In E.M.

(the inspiration for the movie Blade Runner ). A number of respected writers of mainstream literature have written science fiction, including Aldous Huxley &apos;s Brave New World, George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Anthony Burgess &apos; A Clockwork Orange and Margaret Atwood &apos;s The Handmaid&apos;s Tale. Nobel Laureate Doris Lessing wrote a series of SF novels, Canopus in Argos, and nearly all of Kurt Vonnegut &apos;s works contain science fiction premises or themes. The scholar Tom Shippey asks a perennial question of science fiction: &quot; What is its relationship to fantasy fiction, is its readership still dominated by male adolescents, is it a taste which will appeal to the mature but non-eccentric literary mind? &quot; { Shippey, Tom (1991) Fictional Space. Essays on Contemporary Science Fiction, page 2, Humanities Press International, Inc., NJ } In her much reprinted essay &quot; Science Fiction and Mrs Brown, &quot; { Le Guin, Ursula K.

Theories of Science Fiction, (Edited by } { James Gunn and Matthew Candelaria), The Scarecrow Press, Inc. Maryland, 2005 } the science fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin has approached an answer by first citing the essay written by the English author Virginia Woolf entitled &quot; Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown &quot; in which she states: [ I believe that all novels, … deal with character, and that it is to express character – not to preach doctrines, sing songs, or celebrate the glories of the British Empire, that the form of the novel, so clumsy, verbose, and undramatic, so rich, elastic, and alive, has been evolved … The great novelists have brought us to see whatever they wish us to see through some character. Otherwise they would not be novelists, but poets, historians, or pamphleteers. ] Le Guin argues that these criteria may be successfully applied to works of science fiction and so answers in the affirmative her rhetorical question posed at the beginning of her essay: &quot; Can a science fiction writer write a novel? &quot; Tom Shippey in his essay does not dispute this answer but identifies and discusses the essential differences that exists between a science fiction novel and one written outside the field. To this end, he compares George Orwell &apos;s Coming Up for Air with Frederik Pohl and C.  M.  Kornbluth &apos;s The Space Merchants and concludes that the basic building block and distinguishing feature of a science fiction novel is the presence of the novum, a term Darko Suvin adapts from Ernst Bloch and defines as &quot; a discrete piece of information recognizable as not-true, but also as not-unlike-true, not-flatly- (and in the current state of knowledge) impossible &quot;. { Suvin, Darko (1979) Metamorphoses of Science Fiction: On the Poetics and History of a Literary Genre, New Haven, page 63-84 } In science fiction the style of writing is often relatively clear and straightforward compared to classical literature. Orson Scott Card, an author of both science fiction and non-SF fiction, has postulated that in science fiction the message and intellectual significance of the work is contained within the story itself and, therefore, there need not be stylistic gimmicks or literary games; but that many writers and critics confuse clarity of language with lack of artistic merit. In Card&apos;s words: [...a great many writers and critics have based their entire careers on the premise that anything that the general public can understand without mediation is worthless drivel. [...] If everybody came to agree that stories should be told this clearly, the professors of literature would be out of job, and the writers of obscure, encoded fiction would be, not honored, but pitied for their impenetrability. &quot; Card, O.:Ender&apos;s Game, Introduction. Macmillan, 2006 ] Science fiction author and physicist Gregory Benford has declared that: &quot; SF is perhaps the defining genre of the twentieth century, although its conquering armies are still camped outside the Rome of the literary citadels. &quot; { Benford, Gregory (1998) &quot; Meaning-Stuffed Dreams:Thomas Disch and the future fo SF &quot;, New York Review of Science Fiction, September, Number 121, Vol. 11, No. 1 } This sense of exclusion was articulated by Jonathan Lethem in an essay published in the Village Voice entitled &quot; Close Encounters: The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction. &quot; { pp } { Lethem, Jonathan (1998) &quot; Close Encounters: The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction, &quot; Village Voice, June.

Clarke &apos;s Rendezvous with Rama, stands as &quot; a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that SF was about to merge with the mainstream. &quot; Among the responses to Lethem was one from the editor of the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction who asked: &quot; When is it [the SF genre] ever going to realize it can&apos;t win the game of trying to impress the mainstream? &quot; { Van Gelder, Gordon (1998) &quot; Editorial, &quot; Fantasy and Science Fiction, October/November v95 #4/5 #567 } On this point the journalist and author David Barnett has remarked: { Barnett, David. &quot; Gaiman&apos;s choice: shouldn&apos;t good writing tell a story too?, &quot; The Guardian, London, June 23, 2010, } [ The ongoing, endless war between &quot; literary &quot; fiction and &quot; genre &quot; fiction has well-defined lines in the sand.

Literary readers will probably recognise The Road by Cormac McCarthy, one of the sections of Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell, The Gone-Away World by Nick Harkaway, The Stone Gods by Jeanette Winterson and Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood from their descriptions above. All of these novels use the tropes of what most people recognize as science fiction, but their authors or publishers have taken great pains to ensure that they are not categorized as such. ] [ Science fiction world-wide ] Although perhaps most developed as a genre and community in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, Science Fiction is a worldwide phenomenon.

[ Asia and the Middle East ] [ Bengali science fiction Science fiction in China Japanese science fiction ] Indian science fiction, defined loosely as science fiction by writers of Indian descent, began with the English-language publication of Kylas Chundar Dutt&apos;s A Journal of Forty-Eight Hours in the Year 1945 in the Calcutta Literary Gazette (June 6, 1835). Since this story was intended as a political polemic, credit for the first science fiction story is often given to later Bengali authors such as Jagadananda Roy, Hemlal Dutta and the polymath Jagadish Chandra Bose (see Bengali science fiction ). Similar traditions exist in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil and English. { http://www.literaturaprospectiva.com/?p=4544 } In English, the modern era of Indian speculative fiction began with the works of authors such as Samit Basu, Payal Dhar, Vandana Singh and Anil Menon. Works such as Amitav Ghosh &apos;s The Calcutta Chromosome and Salman Rushdie &apos;s Grimus and Boman Desai &apos;s The Memory of Elephants are generally classified as magic realist works but make essential use of SF tropes and techniques.

Although the term &quot; science fiction &quot; is understood in France their penchant for the &quot; weird and wacky &quot; has a long tradition and is sometimes called &quot; le culte du marveilleaux &quot;.

In Belgian and French films, science-fiction is represented, but not nearly as much as drama, comedy, or historical film. In Belgian and French comic books, on the other hand, science-fiction is, among other things, a well established (and often pessimistic) genre. [ June 2011 ] In the case of Canada&apos;s Québec, Élisabeth Vonarburg and other authors developed a related tradition of French-Canadian SF. The Prix Boreal was established in 1979 to honour Canadian science fiction works in French. The Aurora Awards (briefly preceded by the Casper Award) were founded in 1980 to recognise and promote the best works of Canadian science fiction in both French and English. Also, due to Canada&apos;s bilingualism and the US publishing almost exclusively in English, translation of Science Fiction prose into French thrives and runs nearly parallel upon a book&apos;s publishing in the original English. A sizeable market also exists within Québec for European-written Francophone science fiction literature. [ Oceania ] [ Science fiction in Australia ] Australia: David G. Hartwell noted that while there is perhaps &quot; nothing essentially Australian about Australian science-fiction &quot;, many Australian science-fiction (and fantasy and horror) writers are in fact international English language writers, and their work is commonly published worldwide. This is further explainable by the fact that the Australian inner market is small (with Australian population being around 21 million), and sales abroad are crucial to most Australian writers. { David G.

All published in 1875, O Doutor Benignus by the Brazilian Augusto Emílio Zaluar, El Maravilloso Viaje del Sr. Nic-Nac by the Argentinian Eduardo Holmberg, and Historia de un Muerto by the Cuban Francisco Calcagno are three of the earliest novels which appeared in the continent. [ Causo Roberto de Sousa Balanço 2009: Primeiros romances de ficção científica http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0%2C%2COI4262161-EI6622%2C00-Balanco%20Primeiros%20romances%20de%20ficcao%20cientifica.html Terra Magazine 15 October 2011 ] Up to the 1960s, science fiction was the work of isolated writers who did not identify themselves with the genre, but rather used its elements to criticize society, promote their own agendas or tap into the public&apos;s interest in pseudo-sciences. It received a boost of respectability after mainstream authors such as Horacio Quiroga and Jorge Luis Borges used its elements in their writings. This, in turn, led to the permanent emergence of science fiction in the 1960s and mid 1970s, notably in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Cuba. Magic realism enjoyed parallel growth in Latin America, with a strong regional emphasis on using the form to comment on social issues, similar to social science fiction and speculative fiction in the English world. Economic turmoil and the suspicious eye of the dictatorial regimes in place reduced the genre&apos;s dynamism for the following decade. In the mid-1980s, it became increasingly popular once more. Although led by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, Latin America now hosts dedicated communities and writers with an increasing use of regional elements to set them apart from English-language science-fiction. { Bell, Andrea (1999) &quot; Science Fiction in Latin America: Reawakenings &quot;, } { Science Fiction Studies, November, Number 26, No. 3, pages 441-446 } [ See also ] Fantastic art List of science fiction authors List of science fiction films List of science fiction novels List of science fiction television programs List of science fiction themes List of science fiction and fantasy artists Non-Aristotelian logic—use in science fiction Science fiction libraries and museums Sense of wonder Skiffy Transhumanism (a school of thought profoundly inspired by SF) [ Notes and references ] [ Notes ] [ 2 ] [ References ] Barron, Neil, ed.
