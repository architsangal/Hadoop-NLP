[ May 2012 ] [ May 2012 ] Flag of Circassia Circassia ( [ Адыгэ Хэку ], { http://aheku.org/ Russian Language } [ Черке́сия ], [ شيركاسيا ] { http://www.circassianews.com/ Arabic Language } ) is a mountainous region located in the Caucasus of Eurasia. It consisted of various mountain tribes that were at some points allied with each other. Differentiations were made between eastern and western Circassians. [ Geography ] { Russian-Circassian War (1840) } Circassia is located at the crossroads of Western Asia and Eastern Europe between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Before the Russian conquest of the Caucasus (1763–1864) covered the entire and the whole fertile plateau and the steppe of the Northwestern region of the Caucasus, and its estimated population was between 3-4 million. Circassia’s historical great range began from Anapa, a town in today’s Krasnodar Krai and extended southwards towards Mount Elbrus of the Caucasus Mountains and Mozdok, a town in today’s North Ossetia–Alania. Historically, Circassia covered today’s Southern half of Krasnodar Krai bounded by the Kuban River which separated it from the Russian Empire, the Beshtau, or the &quot; Land of Five Mountains, &quot; an isolated mountainous region in Stavropol Krai, the republics of Adygea, Karachay–Cherkessia, Kabardino-Balkaria and Mozdok, a town in North Ossetia–Alania. Sochi is considered by some Circassian as the traditional capital city. { Home thoughts from abroad: Circassians mourn the past—and organise for the future. } { The Economist. 2012-05-26. } [ Name ] { Jean-Léon Gérôme ) } Another historical name for the country was Zygii or Zygoi. The Zygii has been described by the ancient Greek intellectual Strabo as a nation to the north of Colchis. At the end of the 15th century a detailed description of Circassia and of its inhabitants was made by Genoese traveler and ethnographer Giorgio Interiano. Circassia is also known by the name Cherkessia or the native term Adygea. Consequently, the ethnic group is also referred to as Circassian, Cherkessian or Adyghe. [ The kings ] Arrian said «Stachemfak - king Zichia». 1237 year - in the Persian Chronicles, a historian Rashid-ad-Din pointed out that the Circassian king Toocar, was killed in battle against the Mongols { Рашид ад-Дин. Сборник летописей. М.-Л., 1952. Т. 2. С. 39 }. 1333 year - in his letter, the Pope John XXII, to be given to the king Zichia(Circassia) Verzacht, Rome (Avignon) Pontiff thanks of the Governor of Circassians, for the assistance in the implementation of the Christian faith among the Adygs (Circassians) { Колли Л. Кафа в период владения ею банком св. Георгия (1454—1475) // Известия Таврической Ученой Архивной комиссии. № 47. Симферополь, 1912. С. 86 }. Power and status Верзахта was so high, that by his example was followed by the rest of the Circassian princes took the Roman Catholic Church. 1471 year - preserved contract between ruler Circassia and ruler of Caffa, making the name of another ruler Zichia - «Petrezok, the paramount lord of Zichia» { Kressel R. Ph. The Administration of Caffa under the Uffizio di San Giorgio. University of Wisconsin, 1966. P. 396 }. Under the contract Zichia supplied in the Cаffа large quantities of grain. [ History ] { Shapsugian village that aimed to free the coast from the occupiers during the Russian-Circassian War (1840) } The region was famed for its Circassian beauties, many of whom were married to the Ottoman sultan and had influential positions in the Imperial Harem. Most of the population was expelled from its historical country in the late 19th century after the Russian–Circassian War in what amounted to ethnic cleansing of Circassians. Today, the Circassians are found in various areas of the old Ottoman Empire, including Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Kosovo, [ World: Europe Circassians flee Kosovo conflict BBC News 1998-08-02 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/143667.stm 2008-07-06 ] Egypt, and Israel (in the villages of Kfar Kama and Rehaniya, since 1880), and even as far afield as New Jersey and California in the United States, Germany, Australia, { http://www.circassian.com.au/} } and the Netherlands. { http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/02/nj_circassians_join_internatio.html } Circassian nationalism has only recently developed and calls for a restoration of the native homelands. [ Population ] There is an effort among the people from different tribes to use only the term &quot; Circassian &quot; (Adyghe) in Russian Census (2010) to reflect and revive the unity of the Circassian nation. At the moment, they are spread out as Adyghes in Adyghea, Kabardians in Kabardino-Balkaria, Cherkess ( [ Шэрджэс ] or Šărdžăs) in Karachay–Cherkessia, and Shapsugs in the southern part of Krasnodar Krai, as well as small Adyghe groups in Stavropol Krai and North Ossetia. The majority of the diaspora already tends to call itself &quot; Circassian &quot;.
