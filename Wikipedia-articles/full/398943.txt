[ 995.55 ] { 000004 } { search } { shaken%20infant%20syndrome } Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is a triad of medical symptoms: subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhage, and brain swelling from which doctors, consistent with current medical understanding, infer child abuse caused by intentional shaking. In a majority of cases there is no visible sign of external trauma. SBS is often fatal and can cause severe brain damage, resulting in lifelong disability. Estimated death rates ( mortality ) among infants with SBS range from 15% to 38%; the median is 20%–25%. Up to half of deaths related to child abuse are reportedly due to shaken baby syndrome. [ Montelenone JA, Brodeur AE. Child Maltreatment: A Clinical Guide and Reference 1994 GW Medical Publishing St Louis ] [ September 2010 ] [ March 2011 ] Nonfatal consequences of SBS include varying degrees of visual impairment (including blindness ), motor impairment (e.g. cerebral palsy ) and cognitive impairment s. [ June 2009 ] [ Signs and symptoms ] { Subdural hematoma (arrow), bleeding between the } { dura mater and the brain, commonly occurs in SBS. } The characteristic injuries associated with SBS include retinal hemorrhage s, multiple fractures of the long bones, and subdural hematoma s (bleeding in the brain). [ http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/shakenbaby/shakenbaby.htm NINDS Shaken Baby Syndrome Information Page 2008-06-23 2007-02-14 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ] These signs have evolved through the years as the accepted and recognized signs of child abuse and the shaken baby syndrome. Medical professionals strongly suspect shaking as the cause of injuries when a baby or small child presents with retinal hemorrhage, fractures, soft tissue injuries or subdural hematoma, that cannot be explained by accidental trauma or other medical conditions. About three quarters of cases involve retinal hemorrhaging. [ http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/515880 Shaken Baby Syndrome 2011-04-27 Journal of Forensic Nursing ] Additional effects of SBS are diffuse axonal injury, oxygen deprivation and swelling of the brain, which can raise intracranial pressure and damage delicate brain tissue. A recent study found the prevalence of retinal hemorrhages in abusive head trauma was 78%, but only 5.3% in nonabusive pediatric head trauma. { Medscape } Victims of SBS may display irritability, failure to thrive, alterations in eating patterns, lethargy, vomiting, seizure s, bulging or tense fontanel s (the soft spots on an infant&apos;s head), increased size of the head, altered breathing, and dilated pupil s. { Types of brain injury: Shaken baby syndrome. Brain Injury Association of America. Retrieved on September 24, 2007. } Fracture s of the vertebrae, long bones, and ribs may also be associated with SBS.

[ Mechanism ] Rotational injury is especially damaging and likely to occur in shaking trauma. The type of injuries caused by shaking injury are usually not caused by falls and impacts from normal play, which are mostly linear forces. The mechanism of ocular abnormalities appears to be related to vitreoretinal traction, with movement of the vitreous contributing to development of the characteristic retinal hemorrhages. These ocular findings correlate well with intracranial abnormalities. { Post Mortem Findings } [ Prevention ] Prevention is similar to the prevention of child abuse in general. [ Diagnosis ] { Hydrocephalus, an accumulation of } { cerebrospinal fluid, can accompany SBS. CT scanning is one technique used to diagnose the condition. } SBS may be misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed, and caregivers may lie or be unaware of the mechanism of injury.

Examination by an experienced ophthalmologist is often critical in diagnosing shaken baby syndrome, as particular forms of ocular bleeding are quite characteristic. [ Shaken Baby Syndrome Resources http://www.aao.org/education/library/statements/shaken_baby.cfm#ocular American Academy of Ophthalmology ] No alternative condition mimics all of the symptoms of SBS exactly, but those that must be ruled out include hydrocephalus, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), seizure disorder s, and infectious or congenital disease s like meningitis and metabolic disorder s. { Togioka BM, Arnold MA, Bathurst MA, et al.

[ March 2011 ] Conditions that may accompany SBS include bone fracture s, injury to the cervical spine (in the neck), hemorrhaging of the retina (in the eye), cerebral hemorrhage or atrophy, hydrocephalus, and papilledema (swelling of the optic disc ). [ Treatment ] Treatment involves monitoring of intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull), draining of fluid from the cerebral ventricles, and, if an intracranial hematoma is present, draining of the hematoma. [ Prognosis ] Prognosis depends on severity and can range from total recovery to severe disability to death when the injury is severe. One third of these patients die, one third survives with a major neurological condition, and only one third survives in good condition. The most frequent neurological impairments are learning disabilities, seizure disorders, speech disabilities, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and visual disorders. [ Epidemiology ] Small children are at particularly high risk for the abuse that causes SBS given the large difference in size between the small child and an adult. [ February 2011 ] SBS usually occurs in children under the age of two but may occur in those up to age five. [ March 2011 ] [ Risk factors ] Caregivers that are at risk for becoming abusive often have unrealistic expectations of the child and may display &quot; role reversal &quot;, expecting the child to fulfill the needs of the caregiver. [ March 2011 ] Substance abuse and emotional stress, resulting for example from financial troubles, are other risk factors for aggression and impulsiveness in caregivers. [ March 2011 ] Both males and females can inflict SBS, but the abusers are more often male. [ March 2011 ] Although it had been previously speculated that SBS was an isolated event, a history of prior child abuse is a common finding in cases of SBS. [ March 2011 ] In an estimated 33–40% of cases, evidence of prior head injuries, such as old intracranial bleeds, is present. [ March 2011 ] [ History ] In 1946, the concept of SBS and the term &quot; whiplash shaken infant syndrome &quot; was introduced by Dr. John Caffey, a pediatric radiologist. { http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/54/4/396 } The term described a set of symptoms found with little or no external evidence of head trauma, including retinal hemorrhages and intracranial hemorrhages with subdural or subarachnoid bleeding or both. [ Caffey J On the theory and practice of shaking infants. Its potential residual effects of permanent brain damage and mental retardation American Journal of Diseases of Children 124 2 161–9 1972 August 4559532 ] In 1971, Dr. Norman Guthkelch proposed that whiplash injury caused subdural hemorrhage in infants by tearing the veins in the subdural space.

[ March 2011 ] [ Concerns raised by SBS pioneer ] Dr. Norman Guthkelch stated in 2011, &quot; I don&apos;t think that the famous triad, however well some people think it&apos;s defined, can ever be so well-defined that you can say that and nothing else cause it — that meaning shaking. &quot; He is also concerned by the number of cases similar to one he reviewed in Arizona that he concluded that child likely died of natural causes not SBS stating, &quot; I think I used the expression in my report, &apos;I wouldn&apos;t hang a cat on the evidence of shaking, as presented.&apos; &quot; { http://www.npr.org/2011/06/29/137471992/rethinking-shaken-baby-syndrome } [ Legal issues ] In July 2005, the Court of Appeals in the United Kingdom heard four appeals of SBS convictions: one case was dropped, the sentence was reduced for one, and two convictions were upheld. [ De Leeuw M, Jacobs W Shaken baby syndrome: The classical clinical triad is still valid in recent court rulings Critical Care 11 Supplement 2 416 2007 10.1186/cc5576 http://ccforum.com/content/11/S2/P416 ] The court found that the classic triad of retinal hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and acute encephalopathy are not 100% diagnostic of SBS and that clinical history is also important. In the Court&apos;s ruling, they upheld the clinical concept of SBS but dismissed one case and reduced another from murder to manslaughter. In their words: &quot; Whilst a strong pointer to NAHI [non-accidental head injury] on its own we do not think it possible to find that it must automatically and necessarily lead to a diagnosis of NAHI. All the circumstances, including the clinical picture, must be taken into account. &quot; [ Shaken baby convictions overturned http://www.guardian.co.uk/child/story/0%2C%2C1533200%2C00.html Special Reports Thursday July 21, 2005 Guardian Unlimited 2006-10-15 ] The court invalidated a &quot; unified hypothesis &quot; proposed by Geddes and colleagues as an alternative mechanism for the subdural and retinal hemorrhage found in suspected cases of SBS. The unified hypothesis proposed that the hemorrhage was not caused by shearing of subdural and retinal veins but rather by cerebral hypoxia, increased intracranial pressure, and increased pressure in the brain&apos;s blood vessels. The court reported that &quot; the unified hypothesis [could] no longer be regarded as a credible or alternative cause of the triad of injuries &quot; : subdural haemorrhage, retinal bleeding and encephalopathy due to hypoxemia (low blood oxygen) found in suspected SBS. On January 31, 2008, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals granted Audrey A. Edmonds a new trial based on &quot; competing credible medical opinions in determining whether there is a reasonable doubt as to Edmunds&apos;s guilt. &quot; Specifically, the appeals court found that &quot; Edmunds presented evidence that was not discovered until after her conviction, in the form of expert medical testimony, that a significant and legitimate debate in the medical community has developed in the past ten years over whether infants can be fatally injured through shaking alone, whether an infant may suffer head trauma and yet experience a significant lucid interval prior to death, and whether other causes may mimic the symptoms traditionally viewed as indicating shaken baby or shaken impact syndrome. &quot; [ Court of Appeals decision - State of Wisconsin v.

However symptoms consistent with increased histamine levels, such as low blood pressure and allergic symptoms, are not commonly associated with scurvy as clinically significant vitamin C deficiency.

Furthermore, shaking cervical spine injury can occur at much lower levels of head velocity and acceleration than those reported for SBS. &quot; [ Margulies S Shaken baby syndrome: a flawed biomechanical analysis Forensic Science International 164 2–3 278–9; author reply 282–3 2006 December 16436323 10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.12.018, Prange M Myers BS 3 Maltese Matthew R.
