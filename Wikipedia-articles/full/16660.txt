The Kenya Army, Kenya Navy, and Kenya Air Force comprise the national Defence Forces. The current Kenya Defence Forces were established, and its composition laid out, in Article 241 of the 2010 Constitution of Kenya. The President is the commander-in-chief of all the armed forces. The military enjoys, in general, a good reputation. It is regularly deployed in peace-keeping missions around the world and generally commended for its professionalism. Further, in the aftermath of the national elections of December 2007 and the violence that subsequently engulfed the country, a commission of inquiry, the Waki Commission, commended its readiness and adjudged it to &quot; have performed its duty well. &quot; { Commission of Inquiry into the Post Election Violence } Nevertheless there have been serious allegations of human rights violations, most recently while conducting counter-insurgency operations in the Mt Elgon { Kenya National Commission on Human Rights } area and also in the district of Mandera central. Additionally, Kenya’s military, like many institutions in the country in general, has been tainted by allegations of corruption. Further, because the operations of the military have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of “state security”, the corruption has been less in public view, and thus less subject to public scrutiny and notoriety. This has changed recently. In what are by Kenyan standards unprecedented revelations, in 2010, credible claims of corruption were made with regard to recruitment { The Standard 31 October 2010 Activists give military 5 days to re-admit recruit INTERNET http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=2000021408 &amp; catid=159 &amp; a=1 Cited on 03 January 2011 } and procurement of Armoured Personnel Carriers. { The Standard Sh 1.6 billion tender rocks the DoD INTERNET http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=2000020947 &amp; catid=4 &amp; a=1 Cited on 03 January 2011 } Further, the wisdom and prudence of certain decisions of procurement have been publicly questioned. { For example the decision to acquire ex-Jordanian F5 fighter aircraft.

In collaboration with Major Cunningham&apos;s Uganda Rifles, expeditions were organized against the Nandi who put up a strong resistance. It was not until 1906 that they were subdued. Another one in 1900 commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hatch, Commandant of the East African Rifles, followed this. Two medals were issued after these expeditions namely “1898” and “Jubaland 1900”. The East African Rifles also sent troops to help Uganda Rifles suppress a mutiny by Sudanese troops in Uganda. Captain Harrison who led this expedition was decorated. After being deployed on this expedition, he remained behind to form the 1st Battalion of the Uganda Rifles. This battalion later became 5 KAR. In 1901 the British government decided to organize all the existing troops in Central Africa, East Africa, Uganda and British Somaliland under one command. Lieutenant Colonel Manning, an officer in the Indian Corps was appointed Inspector General for all the troops and promoted to the rank of general. After the troops based in different parts of British East and Central Africa territories were placed under a central command, the regiment born thereof was officially designated “ King&apos;s African Rifles ” on 1 January 1902. The composition of this regiment was as follows:- The 8 companies of 1 Central African Rifles became 1 Battalion King&apos;s African Rifles. The 6 companies of 2 Central African Rifles became 2 Battalion King&apos;s African Rifles. The 7 companies and one camel company of East African Rifles became 3 Battalion King&apos;s African Rifles. The 9 companies of the Uganda Rifles became 4 Battalion King&apos;s African Rifles. The 4 companies of the Contingent of Uganda Rifles became 5 Battalion Kings African Rifles. [ 1902-1963 ] On 1 April 1902, 3 KAR moved its headquarters from Mombasa to Nairobi, and together with 4 KAR and 5 KAR, was used by the British colonial government in expeditions against those who resisted British rule. In 1904 5 KAR, which was mainly made up of Indian troops, was disbanded chiefly because of maintenance costs and also because the British felt they had contained the resistance to their rule. This was however reconstituted in 1916 during World War I and stationed in Meru. Later in 1926, 5 KAR was again disbanded and their colours were handed over to 3 KAR for safe custody. On 1 March 1930 the Unit was once again reconstituted, presented with their colours and stationed in Nairobi. After World War II both battalions were used by the colonial government to contain the Mau Mau rebellion. On the dawn of independence the Kenya National Assembly passed a bill (Kenya Bills 1963) to amend the status of the military forces in Kenya. Accordingly, the former units of the King&apos;s African Rifles were transformed to the Kenyan Military Forces and the Independent Kenyan Government was legally empowered to assign names to the units as deemed necessary with effect from the midnight of 12 December 1963. Thus 3 KAR and 5 KAR became 3 Kenya Rifles and 5 Kenya Rifles respectively. 3 KAR, which was the forerunner of today&apos;s Kenyan Army, was formed on 1 January 1902. The transformation of King&apos;s African Rifles to Kenya Military Forces on the midnight of 12 December 1963 is a major milestone in the foundation of today&apos;s Kenya Army units. [ 1963-present ] The Ministry of State for Defence, just like that of Internal Security and Provincial Administration, is part of the vast office of the President docket. All but senior military officers are appointed, promoted, and, if necessary, removed by the military&apos;s professional personnel system. The president appoints and retires senior military officers. With the authority of the president as commander-in-chief, the minister of defence presides over the National Defence Council. The chief of general staff is the tactical, operational and administrative head of the military. Under the 2010 constitution, the defence forces can no longer be deployed for combat operations within Kenya without the approval of Parliament In October 2011, in a coordinated military operation with the Somalian military, troops from Kenya crossed the border into southern Somalia in pursuit of Al-Shabaab militants that are alleged to have kidnapped several foreign tourists and aid workers inside Kenya. { Security &amp; Itemid=115 Kenyan ramps up security at Somali border, eyes al Shabaab } [ http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111016115410991692.html Al Jazeera English 16 October 2011 16 October 2011 Kenyan troops pursue al-Shabab into Somalia in Operation Linda Nchi ] The incursion was reportedly spearheaded by Kenya&apos;s Minister of Defence, Mohamed Yusuf Haji. [ Organization ] The army&apos;s organisation consists of two armoured brigade s, four infantry brigades, one engineer brigade, one armoured reconnaissance battalion, three artillery battalions, three engineer battalions, one independent air cavalry battalion with 35 armed helicopters ( Embakasi ), five infantry battalions, one parachute battalion and one ranger battalion for low-intensity warfare.

The unit was deployed for counter insurgency operations in the Mt Elgon area in 2008 amid accusations of torture and illegal detention.

Thirty-three vehicles ordered from Ukraine were hijacked by Somali pirates. { Somali pirates warn off rescuers http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7639090.stm access date 27 September 2008 by the BBC. The Ukrainian Defence Minister Yury Yekhanurov confirmed 33 Russian T-72 tanks and &quot; a substantial quantity of ammunition &quot; were aboard the captured cargo ship, called the Faina &quot;. } The ship they were being carried in, MV &apos;&apos;Faina&apos;&apos; was released and the tanks unloaded in the port city of Mombasa in February 2009. There have been doubts expressed as to whether the T-72s imported by Kenya are intended for use by the Kenyan Army. Instead, popular opinion is that they were being clandestinely imported for the southern Sudanese army, which has an arms embargo against it. { Los Angeles Times, retrieved 18 November 2008 } The Kenyan military has dispelled speculation by publicly showing these tanks (and other hardware) as part of its arsenal on 22 August 2010, during rehearsals for the passing of the new Constitution of Kenya. { http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/995068/-/wcijn1/-/index.html } Nevertheless a cloud of doubt will persistently hang over the initial intent of this acquisition. Recent revelations by Wikileaks provide that &quot; it is a badly kept secret &quot; that there has been an ongoing process of armaments purchases on behalf of the Southern Sudanese government by the Kenyan government. [ http://allafrica.com/stories/201012110008.html Sudan &quot; arm-twisted govt &quot; to get tanks All Africa.com 10 December 2010 2011-10-04 ] The leaks go on to speculate that these clandestine operations were motivated by the Kenya political leadership&apos;s desire to support Southern Sudan, but not in a way that would openly provoke Khartoum or potentially threaten South Sudan&apos;s eventual independence.

[ September 2007 ] A number of Kenyan military personnel participate in international peacekeeping operations in war torn countries under the auspices of the United Nations. In 2000, women were integrated into the regular units of the military, and the Women&apos;s Service Corps disbanded.During the recent referendum activity the Kenya government deployed over 79,000 security personnel who included police,gsu,kws,national youth servuice,forest rangers and other specialist units on 4 August 2010. In addition to the armed forces, Kenya employs up to 40,000 police and paramilitary personnel. The Kenya Police, which report to the Commissioner of Police in the office of the president, field about 60,000 officers. The General Service Unit (GSU) initially known as the Kenya Police Emergency Company, was established by the colonial government to battle Mau Mau freedom fighters during the fight for Kenya&apos;s independence. It now has around 9,000 paramilitary of which 2000 are Israeli trained and battle hardened (Recee group) that forms most of the Presidential guard,VIP and Diplomatic protection. In addition, Administration Police (AP) 47000 report to local District Commissioners, who in turn report to the office of the President.We also have the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)a state corporation paramilitary wing responsible with wildlife conservation and general protection,it consists of the trap unit,air wing unit,anti-poaching unit,scout unit,wildlife intelligence unit,wildlife protection unit and of late dog unit.It is a well trained wing that can easily surbodinate the military for guerilla warfare following the nature of their work in the wild environment,it is headed by the Director of the Kenya Wildlife Service.Last but not least we have the Kenya Forest Service rangers(KFS)a paramilitary unit that protects the forests of this country. Finally, the National Youth Service (NYS), which is administered by the office of the president, provides some paramilitary training to young job trainees and are about 2500. Other forces include the Kenya Prisons with about 16,000 personnel. Military service is fulfilled by voluntary enlistment, generally for a period of nine years. However due to the present dismal economic situation, annual recruitment of new constables in all the military is not more than 2000 personnel. Kenya&apos;s armed forces combat worthiness against an opposing organised military in the field remains untested since independence. [ Kenyan National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) ] In 1998, a new act of Parliament in Kenya established the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) to replace the former Directorate of Security Intelligence which was commonly known as the &quot; Special Branch &quot; and which was part of the Kenya Police Department.The NSIS brief, like all other intelligence organisations, is to gather and exploit secret information. It identifies conditions that threaten Kenya&apos;s political, economic and social stability. It subsequently develops opportunities and strategies to neutralise such threats. The Current NSIS boss is Maj-Gen Michael Gichangi In May 1999, President Daniel arap Moi appointed retired Brig. Wilson Bonett to head NSIS whose intelligence gathering work includes: internal, external and strategic intelligence. NSIS is divided into seven sections: 1. Administration 2. Information technology 3. Internal intelligence 4. External intelligence 5. Analysis &amp; production 6. Operations 7. National Intelligence Academy It changed name and relocated from its notorious Nyati House offices to new headquarters on the outskirts of the city, near the Windsor Golf and Country Hotel. As the Director general of NSIS, Retired Brig. Boinet is the principal advisor of the President on matters relating to national security. In April 1999, the Moi government appointed Mrs Pamela Mboya, the former Permanent representative to the Habitat, to head a Committee that was charged with formulating a scheme of service for NSIS officers.Security of tenure given the director of NSIS is designed to protect him from such abuse by members of the governing elite. He has the opportunity to say &apos;no&apos; to any unlawful or sectarian instructions from his bosses without fear of losing his job. [ September 2007 ] Officials of the new Intelligence body are: Director of operations, Director of external intelligence, Director of internal intelligence, Director of National Intelligence Academy, Director of administration, Director of economic affairs Director of information technology.
