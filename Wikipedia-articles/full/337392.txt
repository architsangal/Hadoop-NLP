This article is about the current British group - for information about the earlier British group, see National Socialist Movement (UK, 1962). For other groups with this name, see National Socialist Movement. The National Socialist Movement (NSM) was a British neo-Nazi group active during the late 1990s. The group is not connected to the earlier National Socialist Movement of Colin Jordan. [ Origins ] The roots of the NSM lay in a split that developed in Combat 18 in the mid to late 1990s. In early 1997 it was claimed on ITV &apos;s World in Action { McLagan &amp; Lowles, Mr. Evil, pp. 63-64 } that the original leader of Combat 18 Charlie Sargent, who at the time was on remand for the murder of fellow C18 member Chris Castle, had acted as a paid informant for the police, although no evidence for this allegation was provided. Whilst Sargent was disowned by some of the rank and file membership of C18, his brother Steve, also a C18 member, supported Sargent and together with David Myatt led away fifty or so like-minded members to form a separate group, the National Socialist Movement, in June 1997. { Langenohl, Andreas Langenohl &amp; Westphal, Kirsten.

Their whole programme is one of terrorism... against Jews, against Blacks and against Asians. &quot; { Transcript of Panorama } Myatt, who was the architect of the NSM, denied that NSM the supported racial hatred but admitted that they intended to accomplish their aim of &quot; an entirely new society, based upon personal honour &quot; through revolutionary activity. { What the neo-Nazi fanatic did next: switched to Islam } The group&apos;s own mission statement claimed that the NSM was &quot; formed in June 108 yf [ &quot; Year of the Fuehrer &quot; - a system of measuring the years from Adolf Hitler &apos;s birth also employed by the National Alliance and similar groups] for the purpose of championing the cause of Aryan identity and Aryan freedom &quot; whilst also committing the group to the establishment of a &quot; National Socialist State &quot;. Steve Sargent served as propaganda director of the new group and produced their magazine White Dragon. This neo-Nazi publication garnered a following due to its often humorous style of reporting as well as Sargent&apos;s propensity to fill pages with his take on events at his favourite football club Arsenal. The NSM calimed to be a political party although much of its literature advocated violent revolution. { McLagan &amp; Lowles, Mr. Evil, p. 65 } A further magazine was also published, sharing the name Column 88 with an earlier neo-Nazi paramilitary group, although this was as much a personal concern of Williams as White Dragon was of Sargent. { McLagan &amp; Lowles, Mr. Evil, p. 67 } [ Nail bomber ] The NSM was not widely known until 1999 when David Copeland, the London nail-bomber, received six life sentences for his April 1999 bombing campaign against London&apos;s black, Asian, and gay communities, which killed three people, including a pregnant woman, and injured 129, some of whom lost limbs. Copeland, who had joined the NSM after becoming disillusioned with the British National Party, served as Hampshire organiser for the group. { Ryan, Homeland, p. 84 } David Myatt would claim that the attacks had been the work of Copeland on his own and could not be blamed on the NSM. Nonetheless the arrest of Copeland saw the other members of the NSM go to ground. { Ryan, Homeland, p. 225 } [ References ] [ Bibliography ] &quot; The Nailbomber &quot;, transcript of BBC Panorama documentary, aired June 30, 2000 Lowles, Nick.
