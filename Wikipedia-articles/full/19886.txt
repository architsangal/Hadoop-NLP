Bottled maple syrup Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, although it can also be made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in the spring. Maple trees can be tapped by boring holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap. The sap is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup. Maple syrup was first collected and used by aboriginal peoples of North America. The practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually improved production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer, responsible for about three-quarters of the world&apos;s output; Canadian exports of maple syrup exceed C$ 145 million (approximately US$ 141 million) per year. Vermont is the largest producer in the United States, generating about 5.5 percent of the global supply. Maple syrup is graded according to the Canada, United States, or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency. Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup. In Canada, syrups must be at least 66 percent sugar and be made exclusively from maple sap [ Chapter 13 – Labelling of Maple Products http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch13e.shtml Canadian Food Inspection Agency 9 December 2011 ] to qualify as maple syrup. In the United States, a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as &quot; maple &quot;. Maple syrup is often eaten with pancake s, waffle s, French toast, or oatmeal and porridge. It is also used as an ingredient in baking, and as a sweetener or flavouring agent. Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour, although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood. [ Sources ] A sugar maple tree Three species of maple trees are predominantly used to produce maple syrup: the sugar maple (&apos;&apos;Acer saccharum&apos;&apos;), the black maple (&apos;&apos;A. nigrum&apos;&apos;), and the red maple (&apos;&apos;A. rubrum&apos;&apos;), [ Elliot 2006 8–10 ] because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species.

According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. [ Ciesla 2002 37, 104 ] There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; one of the most popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. [ History http://www.mi-maplesyrup.com/about/history.htm Michigan Maple Syrup Association 20 November 2010 ] Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 15 ] Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup. The Algonquian s recognized maple sap as a source of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tool s to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark. The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stone s into the buckets [ Larkin David Country Wild 1998 Houghton Mifflin 978-0-395-77190-7 146–147 ] or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. Production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in North America that is not a European colonial import. [ Europeans ] In the early stages of European colonization in northeastern North America, native peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap. [ Ciesla 2002 37 ] André Thevet, the &quot; Royal Cosmographer of France &quot;, wrote about Jacques Cartier drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages. { Quoted in } [ Sweet maple Lawrence, James M; Martin, Rux Chapters Publishing Ltd 1993 57 978-1-881527-00-8 ] By 1680, European settlers and fur trade rs were involved in harvesting maple products. [ Ciesla 2002 37, 39 ] However, rather than making incisions in the bark as the natives did, the Europeans opted to use the less destructive method of drilling tapholes in the trunks with auger s. During the 17th and 18th centuries, processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar, in both liquid and crystallized-solid form, as cane sugar had to be imported from the West Indies. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 15 ] Maple sugaring parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. [ Ciesla 2002 37 ] Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment&apos;s core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container.

[ Ciesla 2002 37 –39 ] The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained &quot; sweet &quot;. The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree&apos;s normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.

The harvested sap was transported back to the party&apos;s base camp, where it was then poured into large vessels (usually made from metal) and boiled to achieve the desired consistency. The sap was usually transported using large barrels pulled by horses or oxen to a central collection point, where it was processed either over a fire built out in the open or inside a shelter built for that purpose (the &quot; sugar shack &quot; ).

Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flue s, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process. Two taps in a maple tree, using plastic tubing for sap collection Buckets began to be replaced with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup. [ Koelling Melvin R et al Melvin R Koelling Heiligmann Randall B North American Maple Syrup Producers Manual http://ohioline.osu.edu/b856/ http://web.archive.org/web/20060429074616/http%3A//ohioline.osu.edu/b856/ 29 April 2006 20 September 2010 Bulletin 856 1996 Ohio State University Chapter 8: Syrup Filtration, Grading, Packing, and Handling ] A large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. [ Ciesla 2002 40 ] Vacuum pump s were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency. Improvements in tubing and vacuum pumps, new filtering techniques, &quot; supercharged &quot; preheaters, and better storage containers have since been developed. Research continues on pest control and improved woodlot management. In 2009, researchers at the University of Vermont unveiled a new type of tap that prevents backflow of sap into the tree, reducing bacteria l contamination and preventing the tree from attempting to heal the bore hole.

Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain pure syrup without chemical agents or preservatives. Maple syrup is made by boiling between [ 20 and 50 L USgal UK ] of sap (depending on its concentration) over an open fire until [ 1 L USgal UK ] of syrup is obtained, usually at a temperature [ 4.1 °C-change 2 ] over the boiling point of water. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 55 ] Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 53 ] Boiling the syrup is a tightly controlled process, which ensures appropriate sugar content. Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize, whereas under-boiled syrup will be watery, and will quickly spoil. The finished syrup has a density of 66° on the Brix scale (a hydrometric scale used to measure sugar solutions). [ Elliot 2006 12 ] The syrup is then filtered to remove sugar sand, crystals made up largely of sugar and calcium malate. These crystals are not toxic, but create a &quot; gritty &quot; texture in the syrup if not filtered out. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 56 ] The filtered syrup is graded and packaged while still hot, usually at a temperature of [ 82 °C °F ] or greater. The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup. Packages can be made of metal, glass, or coated plastic, depending on volume and target market. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 59 ] The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create a variety of other maple products, including maple sugar, maple butter or cream, and maple candy or taffy. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 65–67 ] [ Off-flavours ] Off-flavours can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup; causes include contaminants in the boiling apparatus, such as paint or cleanser; changes in the sap, such as fermentation when it has been left sitting too long; and changes in the tree, such as &quot; buddy sap &quot; late in the season when budding has begun.

These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, empyreumatic (burnt), milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign deterioration or environment, maple, confectionery, and plants forest-humus-cereals, herbaceous or ligneous. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 71, 73 ] These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting. [ Eagleson Hasner 2006 74 ] Maple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancake s, waffle s, and French toast in North America. They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods, including fritter s, ice cream, hot cereal, and fresh fruit. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potato es, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine ( mead ). [ Elliot 2006 ] [ Imitations and substitutions ] In the United States, &quot; maple syrup &quot; must be made almost entirely from maple sap, although small amounts of substances such as salt may be added. { Sweeteners and table sirups: maple sirup. 21 } { CFR § 168.140 (USA). Food and Drug Administration. } &quot; Maple-flavoured &quot; syrups include maple syrup but may contain additional ingredients. { Sweeteners and table sirups: table sirup. 21 CFR § 168.180 (USA). Food and Drug Administration. } &quot; Pancake syrup &quot;, &quot; waffle syrup &quot;, &quot; table syrup &quot;, and similarly named syrups are substitutes which are less expensive than maple syrup. In these syrups, the primary ingredient is most often high fructose corn syrup flavoured with sotolon; they have no genuine maple content, and are usually thickened far beyond the viscosity of maple syrup. [ Harris NE Replacement of Sugar Syrup with High-Fructose Syrup in Imitation Maple Syrup 1975 Defense Technical Information Center 1–13 et al ] The fenugreek seed, a spice with high amounts of sotolon, can be prepared to have a maple-like flavour, and is used to make a very strong commercial flavouring that is similar to maple syrup, but much less expensive; one such syrup, Mapleine, was popular during the Great Depression.

Food and Drug Administration. } In Canada, syrup must have a density of 66° on the Brix scale to be marketed as maple syrup. [ Elliot 2006 12 ] Québécois sometimes refer to imitation maple syrup as sirop de poteau ( &quot; pole syrup &quot; ), a joke referring to the syrup as having been made by tapping telephone poles.

A 2009 Cook&apos;s Illustrated comparison between top-selling maple and imitation syrups consistently rated the real maple brands (Maple Grove Farms, Highland Sugarworks, Camp Maple, Spring Tree, and Maple Gold) above the imitation brands tested ( Eggo, Aunt Jemima, Mrs. Butterworth&apos;s, Log Cabin, and Hungry Jack).

The sugar maple&apos;s leaf has come to symbolize Canada, and is depicted on the country&apos;s flag. [ The maple leaf http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/df6-eng.cfm Canadian Heritage 17 November 2008 18 November 2010 ] Several US states, including New York and Vermont, have the sugar maple as their state tree.
