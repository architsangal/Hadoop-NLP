[ December 2011 ] The main campus is in the Devon city of Plymouth, but the university has campuses and affiliated colleges all over South West England. Whilst the University has been known as Plymouth University since June 2011 as a result of a rebrand, the formal name and legal title of the University remains University of Plymouth. [ http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page%3D36409 The new brand With Plymouth University 2012-01-09 University of Plymouth 2011-06-14 ] [ History ] The University was originally a Polytechnic College, with its constituent bodies being Plymouth Polytechnic, Rolle College, the Exeter College of Art and Design (which were, before April 1989, run by Devon County Council ) and Seale-Hayne College (which before April 1989 was an independent charity). It was renamed Polytechnic South West in 1989 and remained as this until gaining university status in 1992 along with the other polytechnics. The new university absorbed the Plymouth School of Maritime Studies and Tavistock College. In 2006 part of the remains of the World War II Portland Square air-raid shelter were rediscovered on the Plymouth campus.

The bomb blast was so violent that human remains were found in the tops of trees. Only three people escaped alive, all children. The University&apos;s first Vice Chancellor was Professor John Bull. He was succeeded by Professor Roland Levinsky who was VC until his death on 1 January 2007, when he walked into live electrical cables brought down during a storm.

Professor Wendy Purcell became VC on 1 December 2007. The University was selected by the Royal Statistical Society in October 2008 to be the home of its Centre for Statistical Education.

[ Campus ] When university status was gained in 1992, the university was based in various locations. Under Vice-Chancellor Levinsky the university began a policy of centralising its campus activities in Plymouth. The Exmouth campus - Rolle College - housed the Faculty of Education and relocated to the new Rolle Building in August 2008. The decision was unpopular with students and the town of Exmouth itself, there were several protest marches and a campaign to keep the campus open. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4429228.stm BBC News Teaching college closure agreed 11 November 2005 ] Recently completed developments include Portland Square, a library extension, refurbished and new laboratory and teaching facilities in many of the campus buildings, halls of residence near the Business School and a new £16  million Peninsula Medical School headquarters at Derriford, in the north of the city. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news/012002/06/medical_school.shtml BBC Devon Medical school plans new headquarters 6 January 2002 ] A new maritime centre is being constructed behind the Babbage Building to house civil engineering, coastal engineering and marine sciences. An exception to the trend of centralising activities are the University&apos;s extensive activities in education for the health professions. In addition many of its students are taught at Further Education Colleges throughout Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, such as South Devon College. A new building which opened in 2008 is shared between the Peninsula Medical School and the Faculty of Health, Education and Society. { Roland Levinsky Building } [ Roland Levinsky building ] The Roland Levinsky Building, designed by architects Henning Larsen with Building Design Partnership, is clad with copper sheets in a seamed-cladding technique, is nine storeys high and has [ 13000 m2 sqft ] of floor space.

The building contains two large lecture theatres; the Jill Craigie Cinema, used by the film students to display their films and for showing of films to the public; three performance rehearsal studios; and a public art gallery which displays work by local artists groups, students and famous artists. [ Student accommodation ] For first year students, halls of residence and cluster flats are approved by the university. About 60% of first year students can gain a room in these facilities. { http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/accommodation } The University Partnership Programme (UPP) supplies and manages the student halls of residence at the university. Cluster flat developments close to the university are owned and managed by Unite plc. Places are allocated exclusively to first year students. The University provides an approved accommodation database. About half of all first year students and virtually all second and third years choose their accommodation from the approved database. { http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=2013 } Special accommodation arrangements are made for postgraduate students and students with medical conditions. [ Organisation and administration ] Plymouth is a modern university that has undergone a great deal of development, including several new buildings. Jointly with the University of Exeter and the National Health Service in the region, the University runs the recently founded Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4651816.stm BBC Student dental school is approved 26 January 2006 ] A new £13  million building on the University of Plymouth&apos;s main campus provides teaching rooms, office space, a clinical skills laboratory and research facilities for the Plymouth-based activities of the School, along with the Faculty of Health and Social work. [ Coat of arms ] The Arms, Crest, Badge and Supporters forming the University’s Coat of Arms were granted on 10 April 2008, in Grant 173/189, by the College of Arms. { http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Newsletter/018.htm } The books represent the University’s focus on learning and scholarship. The scattering of small stars, represent navigation, which has played a key role in the history of the city and the university. The scallop shells in gold, represents pilgrimage, a sign of the importance of the departure of the Pilgrim Fathers from a site near the Mayflower Steps in the Barbican aboard the Mayflower in 1620. A Pelican and a Golden Hind support the shield and reflect both the original and later, better known, name of Sir Francis Drake ’s ship. The crest contains the Latin motto, &quot; Indagate Fingite Invenite” which translates as &quot; Explore Dream Discover &quot; and is a quote from Mark Twain, reflecting the university&apos;s ambitions for its students and Plymouth&apos;s history of great seafarers. The Letters Patent granting Arms to the University of Plymouth were presented by Eric Dancer, Lord Lieutenant of Devon, in a ceremony at the University on 27 November 2008, in the presence of Henry Paston-Bedingfeld, York Herald of the College of Arms, the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of Plymouth, Judge William Taylor, the Recorder of Plymouth, and Baroness Judith Wilcox. { http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=24787 } The Coat of Arms are rarely seen in use, other than at graduation. The university tends to use the modern globe logo on stationery and signs and is very keen to keep the Coat of Arms exclusive. The use of the arms is therefore restricted to graduations and other formal ceremonies, degree certificates and associated materials and the exclusive use by the Office of the Vice-Chancellor. [ December 2011 ] [ Academic profile ] The Portland Square Building [ New Faculty and School structure ] The university revised its academic structure to fully reflect its enterprise vision. [ December 2011 ] Key developments include: the creation of a new Business School; bringing together complementary subjects in a new combined faculty of Science and Technology; and creating the largest Marine Science and Engineering School in Europe. A wide variety of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes are taught at the main city campus in Plymouth. The University scores well in law, psychology, geographical sciences, computing (including digital media) and computer science, fine art and art history.
