Severn Trent is a group of companies employing more than 15,000 people across the UK, US and mainland Europe, with some involvement in the Middle East. The main companies in the group are Severn Trent Water and Severn Trent Services. Severn Trent Laboratories was rebranded as part of Severn Trent Services in 2010 in order to better streamline the company to give a single worldwide image, rather than a series of separate organisations with different identities. It is regulated under the Water Industry Act 1991. [ History ] The Company was established in 1974 as the Severn Trent Water Authority, one of the ten water authorities in England formed under the Water Act 1973, to supply fresh water and treat sewage for around 8  million people living in the Midlands of England and also certain regions of Wales. { Severn Trent History } It took its name from the two major rivers in this area, the Severn and the Trent. It was privatised in 1989 and in 1991 it went on to acquire Biffa, a leading waste management business.
