[ the Japanese government initiative the Joint European Torus Joint European Torus ] [ November 2007 ] [ The Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme 語学指導等を行う外国青年招致事業 Gogaku Shidōtō wo Okonau Gaikoku Seinen Shōchi Jigyō ] or [ JET Programme JETプログラム Jetto Puroguramu ] is a Japan ese government initiative that brings college ( university ) graduates—mostly native speaker s of English —to Japan as Assistant Language Teacher s (ALTs) and Sports Education Advisors (SEAs) in Japanese kindergartens, elementary, junior high and high school s, or as Coordinators for International Relations (CIRs) in local governments and boards of education. JET Programme participants are collectively called JETs. Participants currently come from a total of 36 countries. As of July 1, 2010, 4,334 participants { Participants Publications: As of July 1 2010 } (in CIR, ALT, and SEA positions) were employed on the programme, making it the world&apos;s largest exchange teaching programme. Of that number, about half are from the United States (2,420), with Canada (474), the United Kingdom (399), Australia (254), New Zealand (206), Ireland (112) and South Africa (110) for ALTs as well as China (72) and Korea (56) mostly CIRs, making up most of the remainder. Holders of Japanese passports may participate in the programme, but must renounce their Japanese citizenship to do so. In principle, participants should be under 40 years of age when hired. The focus of the program is on English language learning and teaching, so about 90% of the participants on the programme are ALTs; the remaining 10% are divided between CIRs and SEAs. The number of alumni totals over 54,000 from 54 different countries. [ History and aims of the programme ] The English Teaching Recruitment Programme was started in 1978 and initially was exclusively for British university graduates. This programme became known as the &quot; British English Teachers Scheme. &quot; American teaching assistants were later added under the &quot; Mombusho English Fellows Program. &quot; As more countries were included, the programmes were folded into a single entity, the JET Programme, in 1987. Its aims were revised to &quot; increase mutual understanding between the people of Japan and the people of other nations, to promote internationalisation in Japan&apos;s local communities by helping to improve foreign language education, and to develop international exchange at the community level. &quot; In 2004, the JET programme welcomed 6,103 participants from 41 countries. As of November 3, 2009, there are 4,436 participants (366 CIRs, 4,063 ALTs, and 7 SEAs). The total number of JET participants has decreased by an average of 333 people per year since 2004. { Participant Numbers as of July 1, 2009 } [ Administrative details ] The programme is run by three ministries: the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in conjunction with local authorities. The programme is administered by CLAIR (the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations ), and has an annual budget of over 45 billion yen ( US$ 400 million). There is an organization called The Association of Japan Exchange and Teaching (AJET), that provides support for the Programme participants { http://ajet.net/lang/en/services/ajet-peer-support-group/ } and facilitates communication with the JET Programme sponsors. { http://ajet.net/lang/en/about/what-is-ajet/ } AJET organises events and has a number of publications to assist with teaching in Japan. Some notable publications include Planet Eigo (replacement for Team Taught Pizza { http://ajet.net/lang/en/ajet-publications/ } ) and Foxy Phonics. [ Application process ] hold a Bachelor&apos;s degree (in any subject); be a citizen of the country where the recruitment and selection procedures take place; have excellent skills in the designated language (both written and spoken). (English or for non-English speaking countries English or the principal language); have a keen interest in the country and culture of Japan; not have lived in Japan for 6 or more years after 2000, nor be a former participant in the programme after 2007. Official Homepage of the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme MOFA website: JET Eligibility { Prospective participants must submit a detailed application including a statement of purpose and self-reported medical form, usually in November or December of the year before their departure. } { Those who pass stage one of the process are invited to interviews which are conducted in major cities, usually in February. Although applications are accepted from people living in Japan, there are no interviews offered in-country. Applicants must interview in their home country. Interviews are conducted in English or in the language of applicant&apos;s country, but part of the interview will be conducted in Japanese if the applicant indicated Japanese ability on their application, or if they are a CIR applicant. The interview is normally conducted by a panel of three people, consisting of former JETs and members of Japanese government, embassy, and consulate organizations. The interviews last approximately 20 minutes. } [ JET Interview Questions http://koshii.livejournal.com/248393.html LiveJournal ] { Interviewees are then offered a position, rejected, or become &quot; Alternates &quot; (who may participate if positions become available). } { Once offered a position, applicants must formally submit their acceptance or rejection of the offer. In addition, they must provide the results of a recent physical examination, performed by a physician within the last three months. Finally, they must submit detailed contact information so that the programme can send them materials and information as the departure date draws nearer. } { Participants usually learn of their placement details during May through July just before their departure date of very late July (Group A) or very early August (Group B). Alternates may receive very short notice, sometimes only a few weeks, if a placement becomes available. A small group of alternates usually arrives together in late August (Group C) and other individual alternates arrive at other times throughout the fall. It should be noted that applicants who withdraw from the program after receiving placement notification are ineligible to reapply the following year. Applicants are required to depart in a group from the city in which they were interviewed, although rare exceptions are made. This is usually the Japanese embassy or consulate that serves the applicant&apos;s home town, though it could theoretically be any site in the same country that the applicant submits on his or her application. Airfare is arranged by the programme. } Participants are also required to attend pre-departure and post-arrival orientations as well as conferences, including mid-year conferences and returnee conferences, during their tenure. Participants are placed with a local authority in Japan (the Contracting Organization) which is the employer. There are 47 prefectural governments and 12 city governments, as well as numerous individual city, town and village governments and some private schools designated as Contracting Organisations. While applicants can specify up to three preferred locations, and can request urban, semi-rural or rural placements, they may be placed anywhere in Japan, and placements may not match requests. Participants sign a one-year contract, which can be renewed up to four times, for a maximum of five years. Some contracting organizations offer the option of contracting for a total of five years, although some contracting organizations strictly prohibit contracting beyond three years. Often the application for a fourth year is a rigorous process, including an essay and interview in Japanese detailing why the participant feels they should be allowed to continue in their position. Before 2006, participants could only contract for up to three years, with the exception of a few positions. Participants who began their tenure on the program in 2011 or earlier received a salary of ¥3,600,000 per year after tax. { Official Homepage of the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme } Participants beginning in 2012 or later are paid on a new salary scale: &quot; 3.36 million yen for the first appointment, 3.6 million yen for the second appointment, 3.9 million yen for the third appointment, and for those appointed for a fourth and fifth year, 3.96 million yen for each year. &quot; Additionally, this salary is pre-tax, so participants who are liable for income or residential taxes in Japan must pay taxes. { http://jetprogramme.org/e/news/remuneration_change.html } Participants may receive housing subsidies or other benefits including paid airfare to and from Japan, and city taxes paid by the Japanese government. Participants are generally forbidden to take paid work outside of their Programme duties.

The number includes both new participants and participants who are continuing for another year (recontracting participants). [ Contract renewal ] Some JETs elect to stay for the maximum number of contracts - a sum of four renewal cycles (from 2007–2008) for a total of five years maximum ALT/CIR experience. A few may even stay beyond the maximum term limit as sometimes privately hired by their contracting organizations upon tenure completion or take other positions elsewhere. [ Developments ] Some JETs in recent years have been placed in elementary schools, reflecting MEXT &apos;s plan to raise the English ability of Japanese students. Some contracting organizations go further and have ALTs periodically work with kindergarten students teaching basic English vocabulary through games and activities. This also brings them exposure to non-Japanese people. JETs occasionally also teach in special schools. Several prefectures have opted out of the JET Programme in recent years. Some hire individuals directly through advertising or word of recommendation while others use an intermediary dispatch company - usually one of the big English schools such as Heart, Interac or Altia. { JET-Programme.com } While direct-hired employees may obtain working conditions similar to the JET Programme; those employed by dispatch companies often have very different working contracts —unpaid holidays or pay-by-the-day contracts are not uncommon. Some dispatch methods used by certain Boards of Education have even been declared illegal by Japanese labor standards authorities (see Assistant Language Teacher ). From 2007, the possible stay for some JETs has been extended from three years to five years, subject to certain stipulations. A JET participants in their third year is able to re-contract two more times if their work performance, accomplishments and abilities are deemed outstanding by their Contracting Organization. { http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/current/pubs/gih.html CLAIR General Information Handbook } However, as in most JET matters, the application process is decided upon by the individual contracting organization. From 2009, it is possible to apply for an April start. { 2010 Application instruction pack } This option does not exclude the applicant from being considered from the traditional August start. Successful applicants starting in April are notified in early March (this notice includes their placement). The April start is in line with the start of the Japanese School year. Since 1998, the Hong Kong government has operated a similar program, known as the Native English-speaking Teacher scheme, which employs about 800 teachers. Korea has also implemented a similar program called EPIK (English Program in Korea). { EPIK } In May 2010, the JET program came up for review by the Government Revitalization Unit, the jigyōshiwake budget review panel, due to the need to cut costs given the current state of the economy of Japan.
