[ History ] The settlement was originally named &quot; Boomerang, &quot; a construction camp for the Oregon Short Line from 1882-84 at the mouth of the Payette River. Logs were floated down the river to the sawmills at the camp to produce railroad tie s. After completion of the railroad, the settlement moved upstream to its present site and incorporated in 1891 as &quot; Payette, &quot; to honor François Payette, a French-Canadian fur trapper and one of the first white men to explore the area. He arrived in present-day Idaho from Astoria and was later the head of the Fort Boise trading post for the British Hudson&apos;s Bay Company from 1835-44. A large merry man, Payette was highly regarded for his helpful assistance to the many travelers who came through the fort. After his retirement in 1844, he returned to Montreal, but the rest of his life is a mystery. { &quot; Idaho for the Curious &quot;, by Cort Conley, ©1982, ISBN 0-9603566-3-0, p.549-550 } Payette County was created in 1917, partitioned from Canyon County, and the city of Payette became the county seat.
