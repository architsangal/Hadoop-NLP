[ Park Hill (disambiguation) ] [ April 2009 ] [ Park Hill Flats 240px Park Hill under renovation in September 2010 Sheffield Under renovation 1957-1961 ] Park Hill is a council housing estate in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It was built between 1957 and 1961, and in 1998 was given Grade II* listed building status, the largest listed building in Europe. Following a period of decline, the estate is being renovated by developers Urban Splash. { Local Government Yorkshire and Humber &quot; Park Hill &quot; Retrieved 10 March 2011 } [ Background ] A typical deck at Park Hill. Park Hill was previously the site of back-to-back housing, a mixture of 2-3 storey tenement buildings, waste ground, quarries and steep alleways. Facilities were poor with one standpipe supporting up to 100 people. It was colloquially known as &quot; Little Chicago &quot; in the 1930s, due to the incidence of violent crime there. Clearance of the area began during the 1930s but was halted due to World War II.

To that end architects Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith began work in 1945 designing the Park Hill Flats. Inspired by Le Corbusier &apos;s Unité d&apos;Habitation and the Smithsons&apos; unbuilt schemes, most notably for Golden Lane in London, the deck access scheme, was viewed as revolutionary at the time. Construction is of an exposed concrete frame with yellow, orange and red brick curtain wall ing. The style is known as brutalism. However, as a result of weathering and soot-staining from passing trains, few people realise this and assume the building to be constructed entirely from concrete. The concept of the flat s was described as streets in the sky. Broad decks, wide enough for milk float s, had large numbers of front door s opening onto them. Each deck of the structure, except the top one, has direct access to ground level at some point on the sloping site. The site also allows the roofline to remain level despite the building varying between four and thirteen stories in height. The scheme also incorporates a shopping precinct and a primary school. [ History ] Construction began in 1957. Park Hill (Part One) was officially opened by Hugh Gaitskell, MP and Leader of the Opposition, on 16 June 1961. { Sources for the study of the history of Park Hill flats Produced by Sheffield City Council&apos;s Libraries and Archives. Retrieved 2011-06-18. } The City Council published a brochure on the scheme which was in several languages, including Russian. Welcome sign and plan at the main entrance. To maintain a strong sense of community, neighbours were re-homed next door to each other and old street names from the area were re-used (e.g. Gilbert Row, Long Henry Row). Cobbles from the terraced streets surrounded the flats and paved the pathways down the hill to Sheffield station and tramlines.

Although initially popular and successful, over time the fabric of the building has decayed somewhat and some other disadvantages of the estate, such as poor noise insulation and easy getaway routes for muggers, have become apparent. [ November 2007 ] For many years, the council have had difficulty finding tenants for the flats. The estate was nicknamed San Quentin by some residents after the notorious American jail.

Sheffield City Council hoped this would attract investment to renovate the building, but this was not initially forthcoming. The decision to list the estate was controversial at the time and it continues to attract criticism.

Two blocks (including the North Block - the tallest part of the buildings) have been cleared, leaving only their concrete shell. Even now, inhabitants of Sheffield are split on the matter of Park Hill; many believe it to be a part of Sheffield&apos;s heritage, while others consider it nothing more than an eyesore and blot on the landscape. Public nominations led it to the top 12 of Channel 4 &apos;s Demolition programme. Other television appearances for the flats include Police 2020 and in an Arctic Monkeys video. A BBC programme called Saving Britain&apos;s Past sheds light on the building site&apos;s past and discusses the listing from several viewpoints in its second episode, called Streets in the Sky. A piece of graffiti, &quot; Clare Middleton I love you will u marry me &quot;, which is written on one of the &quot; bridges &quot; linking two of the blocks was the subject of a documentary broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2011. The presenter went in search of the story behind the graffiti, [ Radio review: The I Love You Bridge Elisabeth Mahoney http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/07/radio-review-love-you-bridge The Guardian 7 August 2011 13 August 2011 ] eventually finding that Clare did not marry the author of the graffiti, a man named Jason. She died of cancer in 2007. As part of the refurbishment of the estate the developers have chosen to illuminate the portion of the graffiti reading &quot; I love you will u marry me &quot; in neon. Clare Middleton&apos;s name has not been illuminated.

The name relates to the deer park attached to Sheffield Manor, the remnant of which is now known as Norfolk Park.
