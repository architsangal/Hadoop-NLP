[ Early life ] She was born Eliza Alicia Lynch in Charleville, County Cork, Ireland. { Tom Hennigan: &quot; Life of Cork woman and heroine in Paraguary to be featured in TV drama &quot;, } { Irish Times, 14 May 2011. (confirmed by baptismal certificate) } She emigrated at the age of ten with her family to Paris to escape the Great Irish Famine. On the 3rd of June, 1850, she married Xavier Quatrefages, a French officer who was shortly afterwards posted to Algeria. She accompanied him, but at eighteen years of age, due to deteriorating health, { Bareiro Saguier, Ruben; Villagra Marsal, Carlos. ‘’Testimonios de la Guerra Grande. Muerte del Mariscal López. Tomo I’’, Editorial Servilibro. Asuncion, Paraguay, 2007. Page 104. } she returned to Paris to live with her mother in the Strafford household. { Bareiro. Tomo I. Page 104. } Courtesy of a few fortuitous introductions, she later entered the elite circle surrounding Princess Mathilde Bonaparte and quickly set herself up as a courtesan. { Margaret Nichols &quot; The World&apos;s Wickedest Women &quot;.pgs34-34 } She was described as possessing a Junoesque figure, golden blonde hair and a provocative smile. It was perhaps those very qualities that appealed to a visiting South American a year after her return to France. It was 1854 whenEliza Lynch met Francisco Solano López, son of Carlos Antonio López, president of Paraguay, one the wealthiest small southern nations in continental America. The young general López, in training with the Napoleonic army, kept his country&apos;s interests above all as fundamental reasons for his European journey. However, Lynch and López would begin a relationship which led her to return with him during that same year to Paraguay. { Bareiro. Tomo I. Page 104 } [ Paraguay ] Lynch around age 20, c.1855 Once in Paraguay, Eliza Lynch became López&apos;s partner, bearing him six children in total. The eldest of them, Juan Francisco &quot; Panchito &quot; López was born in Asuncion in 1855. The last child she would bear from López, Leopoldo, born in 1867, was born in the midst of the Paraguayan War and would soon after die of dysentery due to the poor conditions in the front. After C.A. López died in 1862, he left his son, F.S. López, as his successor as president. She then became the de facto first lady, as she and López never actually married. Eliza Lynch would spend the next 15 years as the most powerful woman in the country. While she never married López, her marriage to Quatrefages was annulled on the grounds that it did not fulfill the legal obligations for it to be considered a lawful marriage (he had not received permission to marry from his commanding officer, and they had no children together). This is supported by his remarriage in 1857, a marriage from which he had children. { Bareiro. Tomo I. Page 105 } She is considered to be the reason Lopez was so ambitious. However, in a book she wrote in 1876 while in Buenos Aires titled &quot; Exposición. Protesta que hace Elisa A. Lynch &quot; { Bareiro. Tomo I. Page 103 } (Exposition. Protest made by Elisa A. Lynch) she states that she had actually no knowledge of and did not meddle in political affairs, rather dedicating her time during the war to helping the wounded and the innumerable families which followed López wherever he went. [ Battle of Cerro Cora ] [ Battle of Cerro Corá ] Lynch followed López during the entire war and led a group of women, composed of the soldier&apos;s wives, daughters, and others, who supported the soldiers called &quot; Las Residentas &quot;. It was in this role that she came to be in Cerro Cora on 1 March 1870 when López was finally killed. { Bareiro. Tomo I. Page 105, 106 } After the Brazilian forces killed López, they headed towards the civilians in order to capture them. López and Lynch&apos;s eldest son Juan Francisco, who had been promoted to Colonel during the war and was 15 years old, was with her. The Brazilian officers told him to surrender, and upon replying &quot; Un coronel Paraguayo nunca se rinde &quot; (A Paraguayan Colonel never surrenders) { Bareiro Saguier, Ruben; Villagra Marsal, Carlos. ‘’Testimonios de la Guerra Grande. Muerte del Mariscal López. Tomo II’’, Editorial Servilibro. Asuncion, Paraguay, 2007. Page 106. } he was shot and killed by the allied soldiers. At this, Lynch, after jumping and covering her son&apos;s body, exclaimed &quot; Esta es la civilizacion que han prometido? &quot; (Is this the civilization you have promised?) { Bareiro. Tomo I. Page 106 } (making a reference to the allies&apos; claim that they intended to free Paraguay from a tyrant and deliver freedom and civilization to the nation). She then buried both López and her son with her bare hands before being taken as prisoner. [ Life after the War and Death ] Tomb of Eliza Alicia Lynch at the Recoleta cemetery in Asuncion - Paraguay After being taken prisoner she was taken on board a ship called the Princesa (Princess) to Asuncion, where she was banished from the nation by the newly established provisional government, constituted by Paraguayans who had fought in favour of the allied forces and against López&apos;s army. { Bareiro. Tomo I. Page 106, 107 } She returned to Europe with her remaining children; and after five years, and under promises of the then elected Paraguayan president Juan Bautista Gill that she would be respected, she decided to return to Paraguay to settle there and try to claim her former property. Upon arrival, however, she was tried and banished from the country permanently by President Gill. { Bareiro. Tomo I. Page 107 } It was during these events that she wrote her book. Eliza Lynch died in obscurity in Paris on 27 July 1886. Over one hundred years later, her body was exhumed and brought back to Paraguay where the dictator General Alfredo Stroessner proclaimed her a national heroine. Her remains are now located in the national cemetery &quot; Cementerio de la Recoleta &quot;. [ Legacy and Historical Perception ] Some people believe that Eliza Lynch was responsible in inducing Francisco Solano López to start the Paraguayan War and that she provoked him to carry on the futile and bloody war against Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. During her time as First Lady, Eliza Lynch educated Paraguayan society in many European customs and was largely responsible for the introduction of social events and clubs. She is considered a prominent figure of the war for her support of the troops and her willingness to remain with López until the bitter end. Lynch is known as Madam or Madama Lynch in Paraguay due to her European origins, the fact that she never married López, and the implications of her past as a courtesan. [ Eliza Lynch in Literature ] [ Fiction ] Eliza Lynch is often noted as the Paraguayan predecessor to the Argentine Evita (without the change of heart from aristocratic elitism to champion of the downtrodden). Due to the melodramatic appeal of her story, many fictionalized accounts of her life were written at the time and up to the present day, but the historical record is somewhat ignored and liberties are taken to maximize dramatic effect. Novels include: William Edmund Barrett, Woman on Horseback (1938) Graham Shelby, Demand the World (1990) Anne Enright, The Pleasure of Eliza Lynch (2003) Lily Tuck, The News from Paraguay (2004), which won the National Book Award for that year.
