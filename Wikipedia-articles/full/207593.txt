Gregory is an influential American comic who has used his performance skills to convey to both white and black audiences his political message on civil rights. His social satire helped change the way white Americans perceived African American comedians since he first performed in public. [ Early life ] As a poor student who excelled at running, Gregory was aided by teachers at Sumner High School, among them Warren St. James. Gregory earned a track scholarship to Southern Illinois University Carbondale. { Dick Gregory, AEI Speakers Bureau. Accessed December 11, 2007. &quot; A track star at Sumner High School, Gregory earned an athletic scholarship in 1951 to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and became the first member of his family to attend college. &quot; } There he set school records as a half-miler and miler. His college career was interrupted for two years in 1954 when he was drafted into the U.S. Army. The army was where he got his start in comedy, entering and winning several Army talent show s at the urging of his commanding officer, who had taken notice of Gregory&apos;s penchant for joking. In 1956, Gregory briefly returned to SIU after his discharge, but dropped out because he felt that the university &quot; didn&apos;t want me to study, they wanted me to run &quot;. In the hopes of performing comedy professionally, Gregory moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he became part of a new generation of black comedians that included Nipsey Russell, Bill Cosby, and Godfrey Cambridge, all of whom broke with the minstrel tradition, which presented stereotypical black characters. Gregory drew on current events, especially racial issues, for much of his material: &quot; Segregation is not all bad. Have you ever heard of a collision where the people in the back of the bus got hurt? &quot;. { http://www.dickGregory.com/about_dick_gregory.html Segregation Joke } [ Career ] After completing military service, Gregory performed as a comedian in small, primarily black-patronized nightclub s while working for the United States Postal Service during the daytime. In 1961, while working at the Black-owned Roberts Show Bar in Chicago, he was hired by Hugh Hefner to work at the Chicago Playboy Club after Hefner heard him perform the following material before a largely white audience: [ Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I understand there are a good many Southerners in the room tonight. I know the South very well. I spent twenty years there one night.Last time I was down South I walked into this restaurant and this white waitress came up to me and said, &quot; We don&apos;t serve colored people here. &quot; I said, &quot; That&apos;s all right. I don&apos;t eat colored people. Bring me a whole fried chicken. &quot; Then these three white boys came up to me and said, &quot; Boy, we&apos;re giving you fair warning. Anything you do to that chicken, we&apos;re gonna do to you &quot;. So I put down my knife and fork, I picked up that chicken and I kissed it. Then I said, &quot; Line up, boys! &quot;. http://www.duckProds.com/projects/dickgGregory Joke Gregory Told That Got Him Hired By High Hefner ] This routine caused a direct request from publisher Hugh Hefner and he was booked as a replacement for the white comedian Professor Irwin Corey. [ March 2012 ] Until then Gregory had worked mostly at small clubs with predominantly black audiences. Gregory&apos;s first TV appearance was on the late night The Tonight Show Starring Jack Paar. [ March 2012 ] He soon began appearing nationally and on television. [ Post career ] Gregory is number 82 on Comedy Central &apos;s list of the 100 Greatest Standups of all time and has his own star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. There is a grassroots effort afoot to get him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, spearheaded by Radio One host Joe Madison. Gregory is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Gregory was a former co-host with radio personality Cathy Hughes, and is still a frequent morning guest, on WOL 1450 AM talk radio&apos;s &quot; The Power &quot;, the flagship station of Hughes&apos; Radio One. He also appears regularly on the nationally syndicated Imus in the Morning program. Gregory appears as &quot; Mr. Sun &quot; on the television show Wonder Showzen (the third episode, titled &quot; Ocean &quot;, aired in 2005). As Chauncey, a puppet character, imbibes a hallucinogenic substance, Mr. Sun warns, &quot; Don&apos;t get hooked on imagination, Chauncey. It can lead to terrible, horrible things. &quot; Gregory also provides guest commentary on the Wonder Showzen Season One DVD. Large segments of his commentary were intentionally bleeped out, including the names of several dairy companies, as he made potentially slander ous remarks concerning ill effects that the consumption of cow milk has on human beings. Gregory attended and spoke at the funeral of James Brown on December 30, 2006, in Augusta, Georgia. Gregory is an occasional guest on the Mark Thompson&apos;s &quot; Make It Plain &quot; Sirius Channel 146 Radio Show from 3pm to 6pm PST. Gregory appeared on The Alex Jones Show on September 14, 2010, and again on March 19, 2012. [ Personal life ] Gregory met his wife Lillian Smith [ Yes The http://www.flickr.com/photos/the_yes_we_cantv/5756042507/ Journalist Lillian Smith with her mentor Human Rights Activist Dick Gregory. &amp; #124; Flickr - Photo Sharing!

They have ten children, including one who died at birth: Michele, Lynne, Pamela, Paula, Stephanie (aka Xenobia), Gregory, Christian, Miss, Ayanna, and Yohance. { http://www.dickGregory.com/about_dick_gregory.html With my wife Lillian I have 10 kids } In 1973 the Gregorys moved to Plymouth, Massachusetts. [ March 2012 ] [ Activism ] [ Political activism ] [ section March 2012 ] { Miami Book Fair International of 1984 } Active in the civil rights movement, on October 7, 1963, Gregory came to Selma, Alabama and spoke for two hours on a public platform two days before the voter registration drive known as &quot; Freedom Day &quot; (October 7, 1963). { Howard Zinn, You Can&apos;t Be Neutral on a Moving Train. Beacon Press, 1994; rev. ed. 2002, p. 58. } In 1964, Gregory became more involved in struggles for civil rights, activism against the Vietnam War, economic reform, anti-drug issues, conspiracy theories, and others. As a part of his activism, he went on several hunger strike s. Gregory began his political career by running against Richard J. Daley for the mayoralty of Chicago in 1967. Though he did not emerge victorious, this would not prove to be the end of his dalliances in electoral politics. Dick Gregory in 1965 Gregory unsuccessfully ran for President of the United States in 1968 as a write-in candidate of the Freedom and Peace Party, which had broken off from the Peace and Freedom Party. He garnered 47,097 votes (including one from Hunter S. Thompson [ Thompson Hunter S. Hunter S.

Gregory then wrote the book Write Me In about his presidential campaign. One interesting anecdote therein relates the story of a publicity stunt that came out of Operation Breadbasket in Chicago where the campaign had printed dollar bills with Gregory&apos;s image on them, some of which made it into circulation, causing considerable problems, but priceless publicity. The majority of these bills were quickly seized by the federal government. A large contributing factor to the seizure came from the bills resembling authentic US currency enough that they worked in many dollar-cashing machines of the time. Gregory avoided being charged with a federal crime, later joking that the bills couldn’t really be considered US currency because &quot; everyone knows a black man will never be on a US bill. &quot; Shortly after this time Gregory became an outspoken critic of the Warren Commission findings that President JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald. On March 6, 1975, Gregory and assassination researcher Robert Groden appeared on Geraldo Rivera&apos;s late night ABC talk show Goodnight America. An important historical event happened that night when the famous Zapruder film of JFK&apos;s assassination was shown to the public on TV for the first time in history. { Zapruder film on Good Night America - 3/6/75 Robert Groden and Dick Gregory http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DwKK4rkeEM } The public&apos;s response and outrage to that showing led to the forming of the Hart-Schweiker investigation, which contributed to the Church Committee Investigation on Intelligence Activities by the United States, which resulted in the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation. Gregory was an outspoken feminist, and in 1978 he joined Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Bella Abzug, Margaret Heckler, Barbara Mikulski, and original suffragists to lead the National ERA March for Ratification and Extension, a march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the United States Capitol of over 100,000 on Women&apos;s Equality Day (August 26), 1978 to demonstrate for a ratification deadline extension for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, and for the ratification of the ERA. The march was ultimately successful in extending the deadline to June 30, 1982, and Gregory joined other activists to the Senate for celebration and victory speeches by pro-ERA Senators, Members of Congress, and activists. The ERA still narrowly failed to be ratified by the extended ratification date, however, but the Women&apos;s Movement was largely successful in securing gender equality in the laws and society. On July 21, 1979, Gregory appeared at the Amandla Festival where Bob Marley, Patti LaBelle, and Eddie Palmieri, amongst others, had performed. Gregory gave a speech before Marley&apos;s performance, blaming President Carter, and showing his support for the international Anti-Apartheid movements. Gregory and Mark Lane conducted landmark research into the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which helped move the U.S. House Assassinations Committee to investigate the murder, along with that of John F. Kennedy. Lane was author of conspiracy theory books such as Rush to Judgment. The pair wrote the MLK conspiracy book Code Name Zorro, which postulated that convicted assassin James Earl Ray did not act alone. Gregory has also argued that the moon landing was faked and the commonly accepted account of the 9/11 attacks is incorrect, among other conspiracy theories.

In 1980 he traveled to Tehran to attempt to negotiate the hostages&apos; release and engaged in a public hunger strike there, weighing less than 100 pounds (45  kg) when he returned to the United States. In 1998 Gregory spoke at the celebration of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with President Bill Clinton in attendance. Not long after, the President told Gregory’s long-time friend and P.R. Consultant, Steve Jaffe, “I love Dick Gregory; he is one of the funniest people on the planet.” They spoke of how Gregory had made a comment on Dr. King’s birthday that broke everyone into laughter, when he noted that the President made Speaker Newt Gingrich ride “in the back of the plane,” on an Air Force One trip overseas. Gregory was diagnosed with lymphoma in late 1999. He said he was treating the cancer with herbs, vitamins, and exercise, which he believes kept the cancer in remission. [ http://findArticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_26_97/ai_62685512 Dick Gregory Talks About His Fight With Cancer Jet June 2000 ] Since the late 1980s, Gregory has been a figure in the health food industry by advocating for a raw fruit and vegetable diet. He wrote the introduction to Viktoras Kulvinskas&apos; book &quot; Survival into the 21st Century &quot;. Gregory first became a vegetarian in the 1960s, and has lost a considerable amount of weight by going on extreme fasts, some lasting upwards of 50 days. He developed a diet drink called &quot; Bahamian Diet Nutritional Drink &quot; and went on TV shows advocating for his diet and to help the morbidly obese. He is probably best remembered for his attempts, chronicled in the media on daytime talk shows in early 1988, at helping 1,200 pound (540  kg) Long Island resident Walter Hudson drop nearly 600 pounds (270  kg) in only a few months on a liquid diet. In 2003, Gregory and Cornel West wrote letters on behalf of PETA to Kentucky Fried Chicken &apos;s CEO, asking that the company improve their animal-handling procedures. { &quot; PETA Recruits Comedian, Activist in Anti-KFC Push, &quot; Nation&apos;s Restaurant News, 24 November 2003. } At a Civil Rights rally marking the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, Gregory criticized the United States, calling it &quot; the most dishonest, ungodly, unspiritual nation that ever existed in the history of the planet. As we talk now, America is 5 percent of the world&apos;s population and consumes 96 percent of the world&apos;s hard drugs &quot;. { http://www.newsMax.com/archives/ic/2005/8/8/102152.shtml Gregory Speaks:US Has Just 5% Of World Population,Yet Uses 96% Of The World&apos;s Hard Drugs! } Gregory announced a hunger strike on September 10, 2010, saying in a commentary published by the Centre for Research on Globalisation in Montreal that he doubted the official U.S. report about the attacks on September 11, 2001. &quot; One thing I know is that the official government story of those events, as well as what took place that day at the Pentagon, is just that, a story. This story is not the truth, but far from it. I was born on October 12, 1932. I am announcing today that I will be consuming only liquids beginning Sunday until my eightieth birthday in 2012 and until the real truth of what truly happened on that day emerges and is publicly known. &quot; [ WTC 1 and 2: Justice and 9/11 Demands Accountability.
