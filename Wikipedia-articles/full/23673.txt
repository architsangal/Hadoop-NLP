In the Coptic churches his feast day is celebrated on May 9. In the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches his feast day is celebrated on May 15. { Ὁ Ὅσιος Παχώμιος ὁ Μέγας. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ. } [ Biography ] He was born in 292 in Thebes ( Luxor, Egypt ) to pagan parents. According to his hagiography, he was swept up against his will in a Roman army recruitment drive at the age of 20, a common occurrence during the turmoils and civil wars of the period, and held in captivity. It was here that local Christians would daily bring food and comforts to the inmates, which made a lasting impression on him, and he vowed to investigate Christianity further when he got out. He was able to get out of the army without ever having to fight, was converted and baptized (314). He then came into contact with a number of well known ascetics and decided to pursue that path. He sought out the hermit Palaemon and came to be his follower (317). After studying seven years with the Elder Palaemon, Pachomius set out to lead the life of a hermit near St. Anthony of Egypt, whose practices he imitated until, according to legend, he heard a voice in Tabennisi that told him to build a dwelling for the hermits to come to. An earlier ascetic named Macarius had earlier created a number of proto-monasteries called &quot; larves &quot;, or cells, where holy men would live in a community setting who were physically or mentally unable to achieve the rigors of Anthony&apos;s solitary life. Pachomius set about organizing these cells into a formal organization. Up to this point in time, Christian asceticism had been solitary or eremitic. Male or female monastics lived in individual huts or caves and met only for occasional worship services. Pachomius seems to have created the community or cenobitic organization, in which male or female monastics lived together and had their possessions in common under the leadership of an abbot or abbess. Pachomius himself was hailed as &quot; Abba &quot; (father) which is where we get the word Abbot from. This first cenobitic monastery was in Tabennisi, Egypt. He established his first monastery between 318 and 323. The first to join him was his elder brother John, and soon more than 100 monks lived at his monastery. He came to found nine monasteries in his lifetime, and after 336, Pachomius spent most of his time at his Pabau monastery. From his initial monastery, demand quickly grew and, by the time of his death in 346, one count estimates there were 3000 monasteries dotting Egypt from north to south. Within a generation after his death, this number grew to 7000 and then spread from Egypt to Palestine and the Judean Desert, Syria, North Africa and eventually Western Europe. { Kenneth W. Harl (2001), The World of Byzantium, ISBN 1-56585-090-4 (audio recording) } Other sources maintain that the number of monks, rather than the number of monasteries, may have reached 7000. { Peter Brown (Norton, 1971), The World of Late Antiquity: AD 150-750, pp.99 } { Philip Rousseau (University of California Press, 1985), Pachomius: the Making of a Community in Fourth-Century Egypt, pp.74-75 } He is also credited with being the first Christian to use and recommend use of a prayer rope. He was visited once by Basil of Caesarea who took many of his ideas and implemented them in Caesarea, where Basil also made some adaptations that became the ascetic rule, or Ascetica, the rule still used today by the Eastern Orthodox Church, and comparable to that of the Rule of St. Benedict in the West. Though Pachomius sometimes acted as lector for nearby shepherds, neither he nor any of his monks became priests. St Athanasius visited and wished to ordain him in 333, but Pachomius fled from him. Athanasius&apos; visit was probably a result of Pachomius&apos; zealous defence of orthodoxy against Arianism. He remained abbot to the cenobites for some forty years. When he caught an epidemic disease (probably plague ), he called the monks, strengthened their faith, and appointed his successor. He then departed on 14 Pashons, 64 A.M. (9 May 348 A.D.) His reputation as a holy man has endured. He is currently commemorated in several liturgical calendars, including that of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. [ Coptic literature ] Examples of purely Coptic literature are the works of Abba Antonius and Abba Pachomius, who spoke only Coptic, and the sermons and preachings of Abba Shenouda, who chose to write only in Coptic. The Pachomian system tended to treat religious literature as mere written instructions. The earliest original writings in Coptic language were the letters by St. Anthony of Egypt, first of the “Desert Fathers.” During the 3rd and 4th centuries many ecclesiastics and monks wrote in Coptic, among them, St. Pachomius, whose monastic rule (the first cenobitic rule, for solitary monks gathered in communities) survives only in Coptic. St. Athanasius, is the first Patriarch of Alexandria to use Coptic, as well as Greek. { Encyclopædia Britannica } [ See also ] St. Benedict Book of the First Monks Coptic monasticism Coptic Saints Desert Fathers [ Notes ] [ External links ] The Rule Of Pachomius: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, &amp; Part 4 Coptic Orthodox Synaxarium (Book of Saints) Page of the &quot; Saint Pachomius Library &quot; (contains sources in full text) Evansville.edu Earlychurch.org.uk St. Pachomius (Catholic Encyclopedia) Catholic-forum.com Opera Omnia by Migne Patrologia Latina with analytical indexes Hypothetical reconstruction of a Pachomian monastery [ n/50/051557 ] [ Pachomius 292 Thebes, Egypt 9 May 348 Egypt ] Category:292 births Category:348 deaths Category:4th-century Christian saints Category:Christianity in Africa Category:Coptic Orthodox saints Category:Eastern Orthodox saints Category:Egyptian saints Category:Egyptian Christian monks Category:People celebrated in the Lutheran liturgical calendar Category:Renewers of the church Category:Wonderworkers Category:4th-century Romans Category:4th-century Christian theologians ar:باخوم ca:Pacomi de Tabenna cs:Pachomios de:Pachomios el:Παχώμιος es:Pacomio fr:Pacôme de Tabennesis ko:파코미우스 id:Pachomius it:Pacomio abate he:פכומיוס sw:Pakomi la:Pachomius Tabennisiensis nl:Pachomius (monnik) pl:Pachomiusz pt:Pacômio ro:Pahomie Tabenisiotul ru:Пахомий Великий sk:Pachomios Veľký sl:Sveti Pahomij sr:Пахомије sh:Pahomije fi:Pakhomios sv:Pachomios uk:Пахомій Великий zh:帕科繆
