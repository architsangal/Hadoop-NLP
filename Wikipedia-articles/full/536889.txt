All four genera are part of the biological family Callitrichidae. The term marmoset is also used in reference to the Goeldi&apos;s marmoset, Callimico goeldii, which is closely related. Most marmosets are about [ 20 cm 1 ] long. Relative to other monkey s, they show some apparently primitive features: they have claw s rather than nail s, and tactile hairs on their wrists. They lack wisdom teeth, and their brain layout seems to be relatively primitive. Their body temperature is unusually variable, changing by up to 4  °C (7  °F) in a day. { Stafford, S.G.

They have long lower incisor s, which allow them to chew holes in tree trunks and branches to harvest the gum inside; some species are specialised feeders on gum. Marmosets live in family groups of three to 15, consisting of one to two breeding females, an unrelated male, their offspring and occasionally extended family members and unrelated individuals. Their mating systems are highly variable and can include monogamy, polygyny and occasionally polyandry. In most species, fraternal twins are usually born, but triplets are not unknown. Like other callitrichine s, marmosets are characterized by a high degree of cooperative care of the young and some food sharing and tolerated theft. Adult males, females other than the mother, and older offspring participate in carrying infants. Most groups scent mark and defend the edges of their ranges, but it is unclear if they are truly territorial, as group home ranges greatly overlap. [ Human cultural references ] Callithrix comes from Ancient Greek and means &quot; beautiful fur &quot;. Marmoset is from the French marmouset, uncertain etymology. The monkey is mentioned in Shakespeare &apos;s Tempest, when Caliban says he will instruct his new master Stephano &quot; how to snare the nimble marmoset &quot; [for eating], on the no-man island where the play takes place (Act 2, Scene 2).
