The album&apos;s first single release, &quot; Sweet Emotion &quot;, was released a month later on May 19 and &quot; Walk This Way &quot; was later released on August 28 in the same year (see 1975 in music ). The album is their second-most commercially successful studio LP, with eight million copies sold in the United States alone, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Steven Tyler claims that his original idea for the album cover was a teddy bear sitting in the attic with its wrist cut and stuffing spread across the floor. They decided, in the end, to put all of the animals in instead. The album was ranked #228 on Rolling Stone s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album&apos;s title track is part of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&apos;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list. [ History ] For Aerosmith&apos;s previous album, 1974&apos;s Get Your Wings, the band began working with record producer Jack Douglas, who co-produced the album with Ray Colcord. Even though in the liner notes to the 1993 reissue of Greatest Hits it was said by an unnamed member of the group that they &quot; nailed &quot; the album, it was not a hit, only reaching #71 on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200 and none of the album&apos;s singles charted. At the beginning of 1975 the band started working at The Record Plant in New York City for the album that became Toys in the Attic. The sessions for Toys were produced by Jack Douglas without Ray Colcord - the album was engineered by Jay Messina with assistant engineers Rod O&apos;Brien, Corky Stasiak, and Dave Thoener. The songs for Toys were recorded with a Spectrasonics mixing board and a 16-track tape recorder. When Toys in the Attic was released in April 1975, it eventually made #11 on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200, a full 63 points higher than Get Your Wings. The single release of &quot; Sweet Emotion &quot; became a minor hit on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; Hot 100 reaching #36 in 1975 and &quot; Walk This Way &quot; reached #10 on the Hot 100 in 1977.

Greg Kot called the album a landmark of hard rock. For the Blender magazine review, Ben Mitchell called Toys in the Attic cocaine -influenced and mentions the songs &quot; Toys in the Attic &quot;, &quot; Walk This Way &quot;, and &quot; Sweet Emotion &quot; as &quot; Standout Tracks &quot;.
