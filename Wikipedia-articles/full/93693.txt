The population was 690 at the 2010 census. { http://www.omaha.com/article/20110301/NEWS01/110309991/0 } Its county seat is Harrisburg; [ 6 ] there are no incorporated municipalities within the county. Banner County is part of the Scottsbluff, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area. In the Nebraska license plate system, Banner County is represented by the prefix 85 (it had the eighty-fifth-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922). [ History ] When Nebraska became a state in 1867, a single county encompassed the entire Panhandle. { Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey —Banner County. Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2010-06-22. } In 1870, the southern half of the Panhandle was organized as Cheyenne County. The arrival of increasing numbers of settlers led to the partitioning of the county in 1888: the eastern third became Deuel County; the middle third became present-day Cheyenne County; and the western third became Kimball, Scotts Bluff, and Banner Counties. { Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey —Reconnaissance Final Report of Cheyenne County, Nebraska.

Retrieved 2010-06-29. } The initial settlement of the area was by cattle ranchers, drawn by good pastures in the Pumpkin Creek valley. { Hayes, F. A. (1923). &apos;&apos;Soil Survey of Banner County&apos;&apos;. p. 11. } In the late 1880s, these open-range ranchers were displaced by an influx of settlers; by 1890, almost every quarter-section (160 acres, or 65 ha) was claimed by homesteaders. However, the good moisture years that had attracted these settlers were succeeded by a severe drought in 1893 and 1894, which drove many of the new settlers away again; the number of farms in the county declined by more than half, from 565 in 1890 to 226 in 1900. The land thus vacated was again used by ranchers, who raised both crops and cattle. The 1904 passage of the Kinkaid Act, which allowed homesteaders to claim [ 640 acre ] brought a new wave of settlers; however, even these larger tracts were often insufficient to support a family, and many of the Kinkaid claims were eventually sold to established cattle ranchers. The county&apos;s growth was hindered by the absence of railroads: the nearest lines ran through Kimball, [ 11 mi ] to the south, and Gering, [ 8 mi ] to the north. Roads were also slow to develop in the county: in 1923, only dirt roads existed. The difficulty of reaching markets tended to discourage commercial crop farming in the county.

By the late 20th century, center-pivot irrigation systems were in use through much of the county. By 2000, there were approximately 500 registered irrigation wells in the Pumpkin Creek basin. { &quot; Pumpkin Creek Basin (PCB) Sub-Area &quot;. North Platte Natural Resources District.

Complicating matters, lawsuits have been filed contending that water use in the Pumpkin Creek valley depletes flows into Lake McConaughy and interferes with the prior water rights of downstream irrigators. { Hansen, Sandra. &quot; Lawsuit roils waters in Platte River irrigation fight &quot;. &apos;&apos;Scottsbluff Star-Herald&apos;&apos;. 2009-03-10.

From 1960 to 1963, 90 Atlas sites were constructed in Nebraska. Construction of the launch sites, and upgrading of the roads leading to them, led to an economic boom in western Nebraska. Beginning in 1963, the Atlas series was replaced by Minuteman missiles, which used solid instead of liquid fuel, and which were launched from underground silos. In the 1970s, there were 82 Minuteman III sites in the Panhandle, of which 20 were located in Banner County. [ Geography ] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of [ 746 sqmi 1 ], 0.02% of which is water. [ 1 ] Banner County lies on what was once a tableland sloping away from the Rocky Mountains. Over geologic history, it was eroded by Pumpkin Creek and other watercourses, and much of the county now lies below the original High Plains level. The county can be divided into four major geographic divisions: the low-lying and relatively flat valley of Pumpkin Creek, which occupies about 40% of the county&apos;s area; a tableland, in places smooth and in others deeply dissected, occupying the southern one-third of the county; the Wildcat Hills, a highly dissected escarpment that crosses the northwestern portion of the county; and a small portion of the North Platte River valley in the northeastern corner of the county. { Hayes, F.

In response to groundwater depletion and drought, the Natural Resources Conservation Service has developed a system of cash incentives for farmers in the Pumpkin Creek watershed who convert irrigated cropland to dryland farming. Oil was discovered in Banner County in 1919; but the deposits were too deep to be commercially viable. Production of oil in the county began in 1951, and peaked in 1960, when [ 7000000 oilbbl ] was produced from 397 wells. By 2009, the number of wells had fallen to about 200; but new discoveries in Weld County, Colorado have prompted interest in exploring the Niobrara shale, which lies beneath western Nebraska, northeastern Colorado, and southeastern Wyoming. A 2010 sale of oil leases yielded record prices in Banner and Kimball counties. { Jenkins, Nate. &quot; Oil frenzy spills into Nebraska; schools get the money &quot;. &apos;&apos;Lincoln Journal-Star&apos;&apos;. 2010-06-03.
