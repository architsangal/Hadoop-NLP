The Beatles released two distinct arrangements of the song in 1968: a hard rock version as the B-side of the single &quot; Hey Jude &quot;, and a slower version titled &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; on the eponymous album The Beatles (commonly called the &quot; White Album &quot; ). Although &quot; Revolution &quot; was released first, it was recorded several weeks after &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; as a re-make specifically designed to be released as a single. A third connected piece written by Lennon is the experimental &quot; Revolution 9 &quot;, which evolved from an unused portion of &quot; Revolution 1 &quot;, and also appears on the White Album. &quot; Revolution &quot; was inspired by political protests in early 1968. Lennon&apos;s lyrics expressed doubt about some of the tactics. When the single version was released in August, the political left viewed it as betraying their cause. The release of the album version in November indicated Lennon&apos;s uncertainty about destructive change, with the phrase &quot; count me out &quot; modified to &quot; count me out, in &quot;. In 1987, the song became the first Beatles recording to be licensed for a television commercial, which prompted a lawsuit from the surviving members of the group. [ Background and composition ] In early 1968, media coverage in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive spurred increased protests in opposition to the Vietnam War, especially among university students. [ MacDonald 1994 226 ] The protests were most prevalent in the US, but on 17 March several thousand demonstrators marched to the American embassy in London&apos;s Grosvenor Square and violently clashed with police. [ Burley 2008 ] Major protests concerning other political issues made international news, such as the March 1968 protests in Poland against their communist government, and the campus uprisings of May 1968 in France. [ Dülffer 2008 ] The Beatles had avoided expressing political viewpoints, with &quot; Taxman &quot; being their only prior song with an overt political topic. During his time in Rishikesh, Lennon decided to write a song about the recent wave of social upheaval. He recalled, &quot; I thought it was about time we spoke about it [revolution], the same as I thought it was about time we stopped not answering about the Vietnamese war. I had been thinking about it up in the hills in India. &quot; [ The Beatles 2000 298 ] Despite Lennon&apos;s antiwar feelings, he had yet to become anti-establishment, and expressed in &quot; Revolution &quot; that he wanted &quot; to see the plan &quot; from those advocating toppling the system. [ Everett 1999 173 ] The repeated phrase &quot; it&apos;s gonna be alright &quot; in &quot; Revolution &quot; came directly from Lennon&apos;s Transcendental Meditation experiences in India, conveying the idea that God would take care of the human race no matter what happened politically. [ MacDonald 1994 227 ] Another influence on Lennon was his burgeoning relationship with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono; Ono attended the recording sessions, and participated in the unused portion of &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; which evolved into &quot; Revolution 9 &quot;. Around the fourth week of May 1968, The Beatles met at Kinfauns ( George Harrison &apos;s home in Esher) to demonstrate their compositions to each other in preparation for recording their next studio album. A bootleg recording from that informal session shows that &quot; Revolution &quot; had two of its three verses intact. [ Everett 1999 173 ] The line referencing Mao Zedong was added to the lyrics in the studio. During filming of a promotional clip later that year, Lennon told the director that it was the most important lyric of the song. [ Bextor Barrow Newby 2004 74 ] Lennon had changed his mind by 1972, saying &quot; I should have never put that in about Chairman Mao &quot;. [ Spignesi Lewis 2004 40 ] 1968 sheet music cover, Maclen Music, Inc., New York. &quot; Recorded by The Beatles on Apple Records &quot;. [ Recording ] [ Revolution 1 ] The Beatles began their studio sessions for the new album on 30 May, starting with &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; (simply titled &quot; Revolution &quot; for the first few sessions). The first day concentrated on recording the basic rhythm track. Take 18 lasted 10:17, much longer than the earlier takes, and it was this take that was chosen for additional overdubs recorded over the next two sessions. [ Lewisohn 1988 135–136 ] During overdubs which brought the recording to take 20, Lennon took the unusual step of performing his lead vocal while lying on the floor. He also altered one line into the ambiguous &quot; you can count me out, in &quot;. [ Lewisohn 1988 136 ] He later explained that he included both because he was undecided in his sentiments. [ Wenner 2000 110–111 ] The appended &quot; in &quot; did not appear on the lyric sheet included with the original album. [ Wiener 1991 61 ] &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; has a blues style, performed at a relaxed tempo. The basic time signature is 12/8 (or 4/4 with a swing feel), but the song has several extra half-length bars during the verses. [ Everett 1999 174 ] There is also an extra beat at the end of the last chorus, the result of an accidental bad edit during the mixing process that was left uncorrected at Lennon&apos;s request. [ Emerick Massey 2006 243 ] [ Take 20 ] Low-quality monitor mixes of the full-length version of Revolution appeared on various bootlegs, such as From Kinfauns to Chaos, throughout the 90s. [ From Kinfauns to Chaos http://www.fabfour.de/vt183.html FabFour.de ] Then in 2009, a high-quality version labeled &quot; Revolution Take 20 &quot; appeared on the bootleg CD Revolution: Take...Your Knickers Off! [ Kreps 2009 ] [ Winn 2009 171–173 ] The release triggered great media fanfare and activity among fans. This version, RM1 (Remix in Mono #1) of Take 20, runs 10 minutes 46 seconds (at the correct speed) and was created at the end of the 4 June session, with a copy taken away by Lennon. [ McKinney 2009 ] It was an attempt by Lennon to augment the full-length version of &quot; Revolution &quot; in a way that satisfied him before he chose to split the piece between the edited &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; and the musique concrete &quot; Revolution 9 &quot;. The bootlegged recording starts with engineer Peter Brown announcing the remix as &quot; RM1 of Take... &quot; and then momentarily forgetting the take number, which Lennon jokingly finishes with &quot; Take your knickers off and let&apos;s go, &quot; hence the name of the bootleg CD. [ Winn 2009 173 ] The first half of the recording is almost identical to the released track &quot; Revolution 1 &quot;. It lacks the electric guitar and horn overdubs of the final version, but features two tape loops in the key of A (same as the song) that are faded in and out at various points. [ McKinney 2009 ] After the final chorus, the song launches into an extended coda a la &quot; Hey Jude &quot;. (The album version only features about 40 seconds of this coda.) Beyond the point where the album version fades out, the basic instrumental backing keeps repeating while the vocals and overdubs become increasingly chaotic: Paul McCartney and George Harrison repeatedly sing &quot; dada, mama &quot; in a childlike register; John Lennon&apos;s histrionic vocals are randomly distorted in speed (a little of this can be heard in the fade of &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; ); and radio tuning noises a la &quot; I Am the Walrus &quot; appear. [ Lewisohn 1988 135 ] Several elements of this coda appear in the officially released &quot; Revolution 9 &quot;. Throughout the body of that song, Lennon&apos;s histrionic vocal track periodically appears (albeit minus the speed distortion,) as do the tape loops. After the band track ends, the song moves into avant-garde territory, with Yoko Ono reciting some prose over an unknown, vaguely operatic recording (possibly captured live from the radio.) Yoko&apos;s piece begins with the words, &quot; Maybe, it&apos;s not that... &quot; with Yoko trailing off at the end; John (or George) jokingly replies, &quot; It is &apos;that&apos;! &quot; As the piece continues, John quietly mumbles &quot; Gonna be alright &quot; a few times. Then follows a brief piano riff, some comments from John and Yoko on how well the track has preceded, and final appearances of the tape loops. [ McKinney 2009 ] Most of this coda was lifted for the end of &quot; Revolution 9 &quot;, with a little more piano at the beginning (which monitor mixes reveal was present in earlier mixes of &quot; Revolution &quot; [ From Kinfauns to Chaos Beatles 1999 Vigotone VT-184 ] ) and minus Lennon&apos;s (or Harrison&apos;s) joking reply. [ Splitting of Revolution 1 and Revolution 9 ] [ Revolution 9 ] Lennon soon decided to divide the existing ten-minute recording into two parts: a more conventional Beatles track and an avant-garde sound collage. [ Winn 2009 180 ] Within days after take 20, work began on &quot; Revolution 9 &quot; using the last six minutes of the take as a starting point. Numerous sound effects, tape loop s, and overdubs were recorded and compiled over several sessions almost exclusively by Lennon and Ono, although Harrison provided assistance for additional spoken overdubs. [ Lewisohn 1988 136–138 ] With more than 40 sources used for &quot; Revolution 9 &quot;, only small portions of the take 20 coda are heard in the final mix; most prominent from take 20 are Lennon&apos;s multiple screams of &quot; right &quot; and &quot; alright &quot;, and about a minute near the end featuring Ono&apos;s lines up to &quot; you become naked &quot;. [ Everett 1999 174–175 ] On 21 June, the first part of take 20 received several overdubs and became officially titled &quot; Revolution 1 &quot;. The overdubs included a lead guitar line by Harrison and a brass section of two trumpets and four trombones. Final stereo mixing was completed 25 June. [ Lewisohn 1988 138–139 ] The final mix included the hurried announcement of &quot; take two &quot; by engineer Geoff Emerick at the beginning of the song. [ Emerick Massey 2006 243 ] [ Revolution (single version) ] Lennon wanted &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; to be the next Beatles single, but McCartney was reluctant to invite controversy, and argued along with Harrison that the track was too slow for a single. [ MacDonald 1994 229 ] Lennon persisted, and rehearsals for a faster and louder re-make began on 9 July; recording started the following day. [ Lewisohn 2000 288–289 ] The song begins with &quot; a startling machine-gun fuzz guitar riff &quot;, with Lennon&apos;s and Harrison&apos;s guitars prominent throughout the track. [ Unterberger ] The distinctive distorted guitar sound was achieved by direct injection of the guitar signal into the mixing console. [ Everett 1999 178 ] Emerick further explained that he routed the signal through two microphone preamplifier s in series while he kept the amount of overload just below the point of overheating the console. [ Emerick Massey 2006 253 ] Lennon overdubbed the opening scream, and double-tracked some of the words &quot; so roughly that its careless spontaneity becomes a point in itself &quot;. [ MacDonald 1994 238 ] &quot; Revolution &quot; was performed in a higher key, B major, compared to the A major of &quot; Revolution 1 &quot;, although the distortion changes the key slightly, leaving the song halfway between B flat and B. The &quot; shoo-bee-do-wah &quot; backing vocals were omitted in the re-make, and an instrumental break was added. &quot; Revolution &quot; was given a climactic end, as opposed to the fade out of &quot; Revolution 1 &quot;. [ Pollack 1997 ] For this version, Lennon unequivocally sang &quot; count me out &quot;. A piano overdub by Nicky Hopkins was added 11 July, with final overdubs on 13 July and mono mixing on 15 July. [ Lewisohn 2000 289 ] [ Release and reception ] &quot; Revolution &quot; was released as the B-side of the &quot; Hey Jude &quot; single in late August 1968. The song reached number 12 in the US and number 1 in New Zealand. [ Allmusic ] The &quot; Hey Jude &quot; / &quot; Revolution &quot; single was listed as a double-sided number 1 in Australia. &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; was released on The Beatles in late November 1968. It was the first track on the fourth side, four spots ahead of the companion piece &quot; Revolution 9 &quot;. &quot; Revolution &quot; later appeared on the 1970 US compilation album Hey Jude, the first time the song appeared in stereo. Lennon disliked the stereo mix, saying in a 1974 interview that the mono mix of &quot; Revolution &quot; was a &quot; heavy record &quot; but &quot; then they made it into a piece of ice cream! &quot; [ Unterberger 2006 167 ] The song was released on other compilations, including 1967–1970 and Past Masters. It was remixed for the 2006 soundtrack album Love, appearing in full length on the DVD-Audio version and as a shortened edit on other versions. Music journalist Greil Marcus noted that the political critics had overlooked the music; he wrote that while &quot; there is sterility and repression in the lyrics &quot;, the &quot; freedom and movement in the music... dodges the message and comes out in front. &quot; [ Wiener 1991 61 ] Among later music critics, Dave Marsh included &quot; Revolution &quot; in his 1989 book covering the 1001 greatest singles, describing it as a &quot; gem &quot; with a &quot; ferocious fuzztone rock and roll attack &quot; and a &quot; snarling &quot; Lennon vocal. [ Marsh 1989 424 ] Writing for Allmusic, Richie Unterberger called &quot; Revolution &quot; one of The Beatles&apos; &quot; greatest, most furious rockers &quot; with &quot; challenging, fiery lyrics &quot; where the listener&apos;s &quot; heart immediately starts pounding before Lennon goes into the first verse &quot;. [ Unterberger ] [ Political reception ] [ Turner 2009 101 ] Politically, the release of &quot; Revolution &quot; prompted immediate responses from the New Left and counterculture press: Ramparts branded it a &quot; betrayal &quot;, and the New Left Review said the song was &quot; a lamentable petty bourgeois cry of fear &quot;. [ Wiener 1991 60 ] The far-left contrasted &quot; Revolution &quot; with a song by The Rolling Stones that was inspired by similar events and released around the same time: &quot; Street Fighting Man &quot; was perceived to be more supportive of their cause. [ Burley 2008 ] Others on the left praised The Beatles for rejecting radicalism and advocating &quot; pacifist idealism &quot;. [ Wiener 1991 62 ] The song&apos;s unapologetic left-wing outlook caused Lennon to became the target of a few various minority Trotskyist, Leninist and in particular Maoist groups. [ Turner 2009 100 ] The far-right remained suspicious of The Beatles, saying they were moderate subversives who were &quot; warning the Maoists not to &apos;blow&apos; the revolution by pushing too hard &quot;. [ MacDonald 1994 227 ] As further evidence of The Beatles&apos; supposed &quot; pro-Soviet &quot; sentiments, the John Birch Society magazine cited another song on the White Album, &quot; Back in the U.S.S.R. &quot;. [ Wiener 1991 63 ] Anti communist and far right groups also picked on the track &quot; Piggies &quot;, which was about social class and corporate greed. [ Turner 2009 86 ] [ Turner 2009 68 ] [ Promotional clips ] Filming for promotional clips of &quot; Hey Jude &quot; and &quot; Revolution &quot; took place on 4 September 1968 under the direction of Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Two finished clips of &quot; Revolution &quot; were produced, with only lighting differences and other minor variations. [ Lewisohn 2000 296–297 ] The Beatles sang the vocals live over the pre-recorded instrumental track from the single version. Their vocals included elements from &quot; Revolution 1 &quot; : McCartney and Harrison sang the &quot; shoo-bee-doo-wah &quot; backing vocals, and Lennon sang &quot; count me out, in &quot;. Lennon also substituted &quot; we&apos;d all love &quot; for &quot; we all want &quot; in the opening verse. Unlike the single version, McCartney performed the opening scream because Lennon could not recover his breath in time to start singing the first verse. While the &quot; Hey Jude &quot; clip debuted on David Frost &apos;s ITV television programme, the &quot; Revolution &quot; clip was first broadcast on the BBC1 programme Top of the Pops on 19 September 1968. The first US screening of &quot; Revolution &quot; was on the 13 October 1968 broadcast of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. [ Lewisohn 2000 296–297 ] [ Personnel ] Revolution John Lennon – lead vocals, scream, lead guitar, handclaps Paul McCartney – bass guitar, Hammond organ, handclaps George Harrison – rhythm guitar, handclaps Ringo Starr – drums, handclaps Nicky Hopkins – electric piano Revolution 1 John Lennon – lead vocal, acoustic guitar, lead guitar Paul McCartney – bass guitar, piano, organ, backing vocals George Harrison – lead guitar, backing vocals Ringo Starr – drums Derek Watkins and Freddy Clayton – trumpet s Don Lang, Rex Morris, J. Power, and Bill Povey – trombone s [ MacDonald 1994 223, 237 ] Personnel per Ian MacDonald [ Use in Nike advertisement ] In 1987, &quot; Revolution &quot; became the first Beatles recording to be licensed for use in a television commercial. { A cover version of &quot; } { Help! &quot; had been used two years earlier in a } { Lincoln–Mercury commercial. } Nike paid $500,000 for the right to use the song for one year, split between recording owner Capitol-EMI and song publisher ATV Music Publishing (owned by Michael Jackson ). Commercials using the song started airing in March 1987. [ Doyle 2009 ] [ If it&apos;s allowed to happen, every Beatles song ever recorded is going to be advertising women&apos;s underwear and sausages. We&apos;ve got to put a stop to it in order to set a precedent. Otherwise it&apos;s going to be a free-for-all. It&apos;s one thing when you&apos;re dead, but we&apos;re still around! They don&apos;t have any respect for the fact that we wrote and recorded those songs, and it was our lives. right 42% 1 right ] The three surviving Beatles, through their record company Apple, filed a lawsuit in July 1987 objecting to Nike&apos;s use of the song. The suit was aimed at Nike, its advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, { The ad was conceived by copywriter Janet Champ and art directors Susan Hoffman and Kristi Myers, directed by Peter Kagan and Paula Greif and edited by Larry Bridges ( } { Communication Arts, vol. 29, no. 5, p. 112). } and Capitol-EMI Records. [ Pareles 1987 ] Capitol-EMI said the lawsuit was groundless because they had licensed the use of &quot; Revolution &quot; with the &quot; active support and encouragement of Yoko Ono Lennon, a shareholder and director of Apple &quot;. [ Doyle 2009 ] Ono had expressed approval when the commercial was released, saying the commercial &quot; is making John&apos;s music accessible to a new generation &quot;. [ Pareles 1987 ] The &quot; Revolution &quot; lawsuit and others involving The Beatles and EMI were settled out of court in November 1989, with the terms kept secret. [ Kozinn 1989 ] The financial website TheStreet.com included the Nike &quot; Revolution &quot; advertisement campaign in its list of the 100 key business events of the 20th century, as it helped &quot; commodify dissent &quot;.

Billy Bragg performed a punk rock arrangement of the song on the 1997 compilation album Revolution No. 9: A Tribute to The Beatles. [ Wiederhorn 2001 ] [ Billboard 2001 ] In October 2001, Stone Temple Pilots performed &quot; Revolution &quot; live during Come Together: A Night for John Lennon&apos;s Words and Music, a television special in tribute to Lennon that raised funds for victims of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. After their performance received significant radio airplay, the group recorded a studio version, which was released as a single in November 2001. The song reached number 30 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Other artists who have featured &quot; Revolution &quot; on their albums include the Grateful Dead ( Terrapin Station (Limited Edition) ), the Thompson Twins ( Here&apos;s to Future Days ) and additionally with Madonna at Live Aid, Blessid Union of Souls ( Walking Off the Buzz ), Running Wild ( Victory ), and Reckless Kelly ( Reckless Kelly Was Here ).
