Pottstown was laid out in 1752 –53 and named Pottsgrove in honor of its founder, John Potts. The old name was abandoned at the time of the incorporation as a borough in 1815. In 1888, the limits of the borough were considerably extended. Pottstown is the center of a productive farming and dairying region. In the past, its iron and steel interests were very extensive. There were large rolling mills, furnaces, nail works, textile mills, bridge works, agricultural-implement works, boiler and machine shops, foundries, and manufactories of bricks, silks, shirts, hosiery, etc. In 1900, 13,696 people lived there; in 1910, 15,599; in 1920, 17,431; and in 1940, 20,194 people lived there. The population was 22,377 at the 2010 census. Pottstown is not to be confused with Pottsville, a city in Schuylkill County well known for being the home of the Yuengling brewery. [ History ] Pottsgrove Manor, located on the west end of town, was the home of John Potts. Modern day Pottstown is established on land originally deeded to William Penn. Germans, Swedes and English were among the first settlers in the area. After establishment of the first iron forge in 1714, Pottstown&apos;s fortunes became tied to the iron industry. Eventually, blast furnaces for production of iron and later steel opened in the area. Iron and steel production brought the Potts family, iron masters by trade, to the area. They established a forge in the area and built a large home just west of the Manatawny Creek. John Potts founded a town in 1761 on part of the [ 995 acre km2 ] that he owned. Over time, Pottsgrove grew and in 1815, was incorporated under the name Pottstown becoming the second borough in Pennsylvania after Norristown. The Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad mainline between Reading and Philadelphia reached Pottstown in 1838. The extension of the railroad to Mount Carbon in 1842 facilitated the movement of raw materials and finished goods which helped Pottstown&apos;s economy to grow. In the few years following the extension of the railroad, the population grew from 600 to 1,850 residents. Pottstown&apos;s metal production grew and notably, steel from the borough was used in the Panama Canal and Golden Gate Bridge. { Pottstown History from Official City Website } In 1944, the borough adopted a city manager form of government. By 1964, the borough saw the need to re-organize the municipal government. At the time, it had one of the largest borough councils in the state, with 20 members. This was reduced to seven members in redrawn wards.
