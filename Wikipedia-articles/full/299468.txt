D. Wilkes Azita Youssefi Tayna Small ] Silver Jews were an indie rock band from New York City, formed in 1989 by David Berman along with Pavement &apos;s Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich. Berman remained throughout and was the only constant member. During the last few albums, Cassie Berman became a regular member of the band. They disbanded in 2009. [ Background ] [ Early years ] Though often labeled as a Pavement side project, Silver Jews were actually formed at roughly the same time as Pavement. Berman has falsely quoted the band&apos;s name originating from the transcription of a billboard that he saw reading &quot; Silver Jewelry &quot;, although he has stated in an interview that the name was actually intended to be a pseudonym for a conceptual art piece and later evolved into the actual band. { http://raford.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/silver-jews-thursday-exclusive-interview-wdavid-part-i/ } Others claim, however, that the name pays homage to Silver Apples, The Silver Beatles, and slang for blonde-haired Jewish people. [ artist p41541 yes ] [ Touring ] Though Berman had avoided playing live for most of the band&apos;s existence, the Silver Jews embarked on their first-ever tour following the release of Tanglewood Numbers in 2005. They toured North America, Europe, and Israel in 2006. A documentary, titled Silver Jew, was filmed during the band&apos;s time in Israel. [ Breakup ] On January 22, 2009, Berman announced via the official Drag City messageboard that he planned to retire from music and that the Silver Jews would play their final show on Bluegrass Underground at Cumberland Caverns in McMinnville, Tennessee at 3 pm on January 31, 2009. { http://bluegrassunderground.com/2008/12/its-hard-to-find-a-friend-the-silver-jews-are-so-underground/ } { Pitchfork Media article: &quot; Silver Jews David Berman calls it quits &quot;. } The caverns are located 333 feet underground, and only 300 general admission tickets were made available. Berman stated that he would play his 15 favorite Silver Jews songs. He also wrote that his intentions are to move to &quot; screenwriting or muckraking &quot;. He closed the entry by saying, &quot; I always said we would stop before we got bad. If I continue to record I might accidentally write the answer song to &apos; Shiny Happy People &apos;. &quot; { Drag City Messageboard posts by David Berman } Berman originally planned for the concert to be recorded and aired sometime in February 2009 on Nashville&apos;s famed WSM AM radio station; however, the day before the show, Berman posted on the Drag City message board to say that he had &quot; negotiated out of the WSM part out of the deal. &quot; { Drag City messageboard thread with posts from David Berman (username DCB): &quot; final show &quot;. } The concert was documented by several 16 mm film cameras, and Berman has hinted at a possible DVD release of the show at some point in the future. The last song that the Silver Jews performed live was &quot; Smith and Jones Forever. &quot; [ Post-Silver Jews Projects ] Brian Kotzur (drummer) is the front man/drummer for Tim Chad and Sherry and also plays drums for Super Bowl Rocket Ship. William Tyler plays guitar for Tim Chad and Sherry as well.
