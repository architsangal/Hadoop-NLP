After holding several ministerial roles in John Major &apos;s Conservative government, Fox served as Constitutional Affairs Spokesman (1998–1999), Shadow Health Secretary (1999–2003), Conservative Party chairman (2003–05), Shadow Foreign Secretary (2005) and Shadow Defence Secretary (2005–10). Fox stood unsuccessfully in the 2005 Conservative leadership election. In 2010, he was appointed Secretary of State for Defence, a position from which he resigned on 14 October 2011 over allegations that he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.

Along with his brother and two sisters he was educated in the state sector; he attended St. Bride&apos;s High School. He studied medicine at the University of Glasgow Medical School, graduating with MB ChB degrees in 1983. Fox is a general practitioner (he was a GP in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, before his election to Parliament), a former Civilian Army Medical Officer and Divisional Surgeon with St John Ambulance. He is a member of the Royal College of General Practitioners. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12283134 BBC News Article BBC News 26 January 2011 26 January 2011 ] Whilst studying at the University of Glasgow, he was a member of the Dialectic Society and became president of the Glasgow University Conservative Association. From there he advanced through the Conservative ranks. Fox contested the Hairmyres Ward of East Kilbride District Council in May 1984, coming second – 210 votes – to the incumbent Labour Councillor, Ed McKenna. While studying medicine at Glasgow University in the early 1980s, Fox resigned his position on the university&apos;s Students Representative Council (SRC) in protest at the council passing a motion condemning the decision of the university&apos;s Glasgow University Union (GUU) not to allow a gay students society to join the union. The SRC motion called both the union&apos;s decision and the explanations given for it &quot; bigoted &quot;. The GUU maintained its stance regardless and the controversy was reported in the national media while leading to many other university student unions up and down the country, including Edinburgh, cutting ties with their Glasgow counterparts. Explaining his decision to resign from the SRC and support the GUU&apos;s position, Fox was quoted as saying &quot; I&apos;m actually quite liberal when it comes to sexual matters. I just don&apos;t want the gays flaunting it in front of me, which is what they would do. &quot; When asked about the controversy in 2008, Fox remarked that &quot; fortunately most of us have progressed from the days when we were students more than a quarter of a century ago &quot;.

Thereafter, he sought and won nomination for the English constituency of Woodspring and was successful in being elected MP for that constituency at the 1992 general election. [ In government ] A little over a year after his election in 1992, Fox was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, in June 1993. Thereafter, in July 1994, he was appointed an Assistant Government Whip. Following a limited government reshuffle in November 1995, he was appointed a Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty&apos;s Treasury – a Senior Government Whip. He was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1996 to 1997. In 1996, he brokered an accord in Sri Lanka, called the Fox Peace Plan, between Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge’s PA and the opposition UNP of Ranil Wickremesinghe, on a bipartisan approach for ending the ethnic war. However, little has happened since then to suggest that the various parties have acted in good faith in the interests of peace.

Between 1999 and 2003 he was the Shadow Secretary of State for Health. In November 2003, Fox was appointed campaign manager for Michael Howard following the no-confidence vote against the Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith. Fox was made co-chairman of the party by Michael Howard when he became party leader in November 2003. After the 2005 general election he was promoted within the Shadow Cabinet to become Shadow Foreign Secretary. On 7 December 2005 he was moved to Defence by new Leader of the Opposition David Cameron MP. [ Leadership bid ] In September 2005, Fox announced he would join the contest to be the next leader of the Conservative party. His campaign theme for the 2005 leadership race was based on the &quot; broken society &quot; theme, which he says Conservatives can address by returning emphasis to marriage and reforming welfare. In the initial ballot of Conservative MPs, on 18 October, he gained enough support (42 votes) to avoid coming last, and put himself through to the second ballot to be held two days later. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4352666.stm Fox says he has &apos;great momentum&apos; BBC News 18 October 2005 26 June 2008 ] He was eliminated with 51 votes in third place behind David Cameron (90 votes) and David Davis (57 votes). Cameron, who eventually won the leadership election, gave Fox the role of Shadow Defence Secretary. [ Secretary of State for Defence ] He was appointed as Secretary of State for Defence in the cabinet of David Cameron on 12 May 2010 and that weekend flew out to Afghanistan with the Foreign Secretary, William Hague and the International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell to see first hand the issues facing the troops based there. In July 2010 he said that the dire state of the public finances meant the Armed Forces could no longer be equipped to cover every conceivable danger. He said that the strongest signal that it will have to give up one or more of these capabilities, which have been maintained at the same time as contributing to collective security pacts such as NATO. “We don’t have the money as a country to protect ourselves against every potential future threat,” he said. “We have to look at where we think the real risks will come from, where the real threats will come from and we need to deal with that accordingly. The Russians are not going to come over the European plain any day soon,” he added. Dr Fox’s admission casts doubt on the future of the 25,000 troops currently stationed in Germany. The Defence Secretary has previously said that he hoped to withdraw them at some point, leaving Britain without a presence in the country for the first time since 1945.

The results of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) are expected around the same time as the cross-Government comprehensive spending review, which will be published on 20 October. The defence industry is very concerned that the review is being led by budget concerns rather than military need. Speaking in September 2010 Fox said on the possibility of sharing aircraft carriers with the French Navy that &quot; I think it is unrealistic to share an aircraft carrier but, in other areas like tactical lift we can see what we can do, &quot; Liam Fox, said at a meeting in Paris with Herve Morin. &quot; I can&apos;t deny that there is an element of urgency added by budget concerns. &quot; [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/7980904/UK-and-France-wont-share-aircraft-carriers-says-Defence-Secretary-Liam-Fox.html UK and France won&apos;t share aircraft carriers, says Defence Secretary Liam Fox The Daily Telegraph 3 September 2010 14 November 2011 Amy Wilson ] In September 2010 Fox in a private letter to David Cameron, Fox refuses to back any substantial reduction in the Armed Forces. He says it risks seriously damaging troops’ morale. The letter was written the night before a National Security Council (NSC) meeting on the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). In the letter Fox wrote that: &quot; Frankly this process is looking less and less defensible as a proper SDSR (Strategic Defence and Strategy Review) and more like a &quot; super CSR &quot; (Comprehensive Spending Review). If it continues on its current trajectory it is likely to have grave political consequences for us &quot;. Fox continued saying that &quot; Our decisions today will limit severely the options available to this and all future governments. The range of operations that we can do today we will simply not be able to do in the future. In particular, it would place at risk &quot; [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/8031385/Defence-cuts-Liam-Foxs-leaked-letter-in-full.html Defence cuts: Liam Fox&apos;s leaked letter in full The Daily Telegraph 28 September 2010 14 November 2011 ] In February 2011 Fox launched an attack on “ballooning” spending in his own department as figures show projects are running at least £8.8 billion over budget. The top 15 major procurement projects are now running at £8.8 billion over budget and, between them, are delayed by a total of 32 years. That includes the A400M transporter aircraft order that is £603 million over budget and six years behind schedule. He will criticise what he calls a “conspiracy of optimism based on poor cost-estimation, unrealistic timescales” at the MoD and in industry. “These practices in the MOD would simply not be tolerated in the private sector, and they will no longer be tolerated in the MoD.” A “new, frank and honest relationship between Government and industry” is needed and Mr Fox will signal that change must come.

Cameron has conceded that axing around 5,000 personnel from the army, 3,300 from the Navy and 2,700 from the RAF will be difficult for those affected. Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) set out plans for reducing the size of the armed forces by 17,000 in total. Some of that number will be met by not replacing people who were retiring or leaving for other reasons. Defence officials said 11,000 personnel still face being redundant on a compulsory or voluntary basis.Dr Fox said it was essential that service personnel were made &quot; fully aware of the options available and the timescales involved &quot;. &quot; That means that a timetable needs to be adhered to for the sake of themselves and their families, &quot; he said. &quot; It would simply be wrong to alter that timetable for the convenience of the Government.

In a leaked letter to the Prime Minister, Dr Fox said he could not accept plans to increase the development budget to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. The aid pledge, made in the Conservative election manifesto last year, was at the heart of Mr Cameron&apos;s attempts to change his party&apos;s image. It has gained opponents among Right–wing Tories, many of whom voted for Dr Fox when he fought Mr Cameron for the party leadership in 2005. &quot; I cannot support the proposal in its current form, &quot; Dr Fox told the Prime Minister. Dr Fox suggested that development funding should be diverted to the defence budget, writing that reneging on the aid pledge would release more public money to be spent on &quot; other activities or programmes rather than aid &quot;. The letter is the second significant private message from Dr Fox to Mr Cameron that has leaked. Last year, The Daily Telegraph obtained a letter in which the Defence Secretary warned the Prime Minister that &quot; draconian &quot; cuts in the defence budget could cripple the Armed Forces. Dr Fox&apos;s rejection of the aid commitment and the leaking of his letter will fuel suspicion among Mr Cameron&apos;s allies that the Defence Secretary is trying to undermine the Prime Minister and may one day seek the Conservative leadership again. He finished third in the 2005 contest, behind Mr Cameron and David Davis.

He also warned that high-ranking members of the Armed Forces were facing the sack because the Government wanted to reduce bureaucracy by cutting “the star count”.The Daily Telegraph has learnt that the redundancies will include up 500 starred officers, equivalent to the rank of an Army brigadier and above. Dr Fox said: “We must be very careful, those of us who have authority in defence, when discussing the sustainability of a mission. People’s lives are at stake and there can only be one message that goes out on Libya.” Admiral Sir John “Sandy” Woodward, a former deputy chief of the defence staff, suggested Dr Fox was trying to blame military chiefs for “his own failings”. He said: “Of course the service chiefs should not be talking outside the MoD, but when politicians have got it so wrong they have no other choice.” [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8602016/Outspoken-Forces-chiefs-risk-lives-warns-Liam-Fox.html Outspoken Forces chiefs risk lives, warns Liam Fox The Daily Telegraph 27 June 2011 14 November 2011 Thomas Harding ] [ Levene report ] On 27 June 2011 Fox announced that Baron Levene had completed his report [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8600041/MoD-is-bureaucratic-bloated-and-indecisive-warns-report.html MoD is bureaucratic, bloated and indecisive, warns report The Daily Telegraph 27 June 2011 14 November 2011 James Kirkup ] on the reform of the MoD and suggested that will cut the number of senior officers and could also lead to ministerial posts being axed. The army, navy and air force will each be run by a single chief. Currently, the services have two commanders, one in charge of strategy, the second in charge of day-to-day operations. The reforms would see operational control pushed down the chain of command. In addition, the three service chiefs will be removed from the defence board, a powerful committee the defence secretary chairs. The overall head of the military, the chief of the defence staff, currently General Sir David Richards, will represent them. A committee chaired by an independent non-executive director, chosen by the defence secretary, will be in charge of appointments to the services&apos; top ranks. The MoD is expected to axe up to 8,000 civil servants in 2012. Senior commanders would be given more overall control of their budgets and internal appointments.

Levene says that &quot; finance and the need for affordability are not regarded as sufficiently important throughout the organisation. &quot; He says that the &quot; lack of trust &quot; which pervades the MoD has led to a tendency for those at the top to try to micromanage, while the individual services look out for themselves rather than thinking of defence as a whole. This has led to a &quot; predisposition to overcomplicate... and a culture of reinventing the wheel &quot;.The role of the chief of the defence staff should also be enhanced so that &quot; he alone will be responsible for representing the military voice. &quot; Levene says that the new defence board &quot; should be the primary decision-making body for non-operational matters &quot;, and should meet 10 times a year. It will have nine members, but only one will be from the military, the chief of the defence staff, currently General Sir David Richards.

In terms of equipment, the RAF will lose the Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft programme, the entire Harrier jump-jet fleet will be scrapped, and bases will be turned over to the Army. The Army will have its tanks and heavy artillery cut by 40%, and half of the soldiers in Germany will return to the UK by 2015, with the rest brought home by 2030 and housed in former RAF bases. The Navy will have its destroyer and Frigate fleet cut from 23 to 19 (by cutting the type 22 frigates) and will be provided with less expensive frigates. It will also be affected by the loss of the Harriers. Overall, the defence budget is to be cut by 8% but Mr Cameron insisted that Britain would continue to meet the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.
