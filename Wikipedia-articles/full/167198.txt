This article refers to the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve. For other countries see global strategic petroleum reserves The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is an emergency fuel storage of oil maintained by the United States Department of Energy. It is the largest emergency supply in the world with the capacity to hold up to [ 727 Moilbbl m3 ]. The current inventory is displayed on the SPR&apos;s website. As of February 29, 2012, the inventory was [ 695.9 Moilbbl m3 ]. This equates to 36 days of oil at current daily US consumption levels of [ 19.5 Moilbbl/d m3/d ]. { CIA World Factbook site } At recent market prices ($102 a barrel as of February 2012 { Energy Information Agency statistics } ) the SPR holds over $26.7 billion in sweet crude and approximately $37.7 billion in sour crude (assuming a $15/barrel discount for sulfur content). The total value of the crude in the SPR is approximately $64.5 billion USD. The price paid for the oil is $20.1 billion (an average of $28.42 per barrel). [ http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/reserves/spr/spr-facts.html Strategic Petroleum Reserve - Quick Facts and Frequently Asked Questions US Department of Energy February 25, 2012 ] Purchases of crude oil resumed in January 2009 using revenues available from the 2005 Hurricane Katrina emergency sale. The DOE purchased [ 10700000 oilbbl ] at a cost of $553 million. { DOE SPR site } The United States started the petroleum reserve in 1975 after oil supplies were cut off during the 1973-74 oil embargo, to mitigate future temporary supply disruptions. According to the World Factbook, [ https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html The World Factbook - United States CIA February 25, 2012 ] the United States imports a net [ 12 Moilbbl m3 ] of oil a day (MMbd), so the SPR holds about a 58-day supply. However, the maximum total withdrawal capability from the SPR is only [ 4.4 Moilbbl m3 ] per day, making it a 160 + day supply. [ Facilities ] The SPR management office is located in New Orleans, Louisiana. The reserve is stored at four sites on the Gulf of Mexico, each located near a major center of petrochemical refining and processing. Each site contains a number of artificial caverns created in salt dome s below the surface. Individual caverns within a site can be up to 1000 m below the surface, average dimensions are 60 m wide and 600 m deep, and capacity ranges from [ 6 to 37 Moilbbl m3 ]. Almost $4 billion was spent on the facilities. The decision to store in caverns was made in order to reduce costs; the Department of Energy claims it is roughly 10 times cheaper to store oil below surface with the added advantages of no leaks and a constant natural churn of the oil due to a temperature gradient in the caverns. The caverns were created by drilling down and then dissolving the salt with water.

Oil reserve site raises ire, Bush policy tested, Reuters, Retrieved on May 16, 2008 [ Retired ] [ 72 Moilbbl m3 ] Weeks Island - Iberia Parish, Louisiana (Decommissioned 1999) Capacity of. This facility was a conventional room and pillar near-surface salt mine, formerly owned by Morton Salt. In 1993, a sinkhole formed on the site, allowing fresh water to intrude into the mine. Because of the mine&apos;s construction in salt deposits, fresh water would erode the ceiling, potentially causing the structure to fail. The mine was backfilled with salt-saturated brine. This process, which allowed for recovery of 98% of the petroleum stored in the facility, reduced the risk of further freshwater intrusion, and helped prevent the remaining oil from leaking into the aquifer that is located over the salt dome. [ History ] [ Background ] Access to the reserve is determined by the conditions written into the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), primarily to counter a severe supply interruption. The maximum removal rate, by physical constraints, is [ 4.4 Moilbbl/d m3/d ]. Oil could begin entering the marketplace 13 days after a presidential order. The Department of Energy says it has about 59 days of import protection in the SPR. This, combined with private sector inventory protection, is estimated to equal 115 days of imports. The SPR was created following the 1973 energy crisis. The EPCA of December 22, 1975, made it policy for the U.S. to establish a reserve up to 1 billion barrels (159 million m³) of petroleum. A number of existing storage sites were acquired in 1977. Construction of the first surface facilities began in June 1977. On July 21, 1977, the first oil —approximately [ 412000 oilbbl m3 ] of Saudi Arabian light crude —was delivered to the SPR. Fill was suspended in FY 1995 to devote budget resources to refurbishing the SPR equipment and extending the life of the complex. The current SPR sites are expected to be usable until around 2025. Fill was resumed in 1999. [ Filling and Suspending the SPR ] On November 13, 2001, President George W. Bush announced that the SPR would be filled, saying, &quot; The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is an important element of our Nation&apos;s energy security. To maximize long-term protection against oil supply disruptions, I am directing the Secretary of Energy to fill the SPR up to its 700 million barrel [111,000,000 m³] capacity. &quot; The highest prior level was reached in 1994 with [ 592 Moilbbl m3 ]. At the time of President Bush&apos;s directive, the SPR contained about [ 545 Moilbbl m3 ]. Since the directive in 2001, the capacity of the SPR increased by [ 27 Moilbbl m3 ] due to natural enlargement of the salt caverns in which the reserves are stored. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 has since directed the Secretary of Energy to fill the SPR to the full [ 1 Goilbbl m3 on ] authorized capacity, a process which will require a physical expansion of the Reserve&apos;s facilities. On August 17, 2005, the SPR reached its goal of [ 700 Moilbbl m3 ], or about 96% of its now-increased [ 727 Moilbbl m3 on ] capacity. Approximately 60% of the crude oil in the reserve is the less desirable sour (high sulfur content) variety. The oil delivered to the reserve is &quot; royalty-in-kind &quot; oil —royalties owed to the U.S. government by operators who acquire leases on the federally owned Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. These royalties were previously collected as cash, but in 1998 the government began testing the effectiveness of collecting royalties &quot; in kind &quot; - or in other words, acquiring the crude oil itself. This mechanism was adopted when refilling the SPR began, and once filling is completed, revenues from the sale of future royalties will be paid into the federal treasury. On April 25, 2006, President Bush announced a temporary halt to petroleum deposits to the SPR as part of a four point program to alleviate high fuel prices. [ May 2008 ] On January 23, 2007, President Bush suggested in his State of the Union speech that Congress should approve expansion of the current reserve capacity to twice its current level.

On May 12, 2008, Rep. Peter Welch ( D, Vermont ) and 63 co-sponsors introduced the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act bill ( H.R.6022 ), to suspend the acquisition of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

This announcement came days after Congress voted to direct the Bush administration to do the same. The U.S. Department of Energy did not state when the shipments would resume.

The purchase will be funded by the roughly $600 million received in 2005 from the emergency sales. [ Emergency sales to Israel ] According to the 1975 Sinai Interim Agreement signed by the United States and Israel as a precondition for Israel&apos;s return of the Sinai Peninsula and its associated oil reserves to Egypt, in an emergency the U.S. is obligated to make oil available for sale to Israel for up to 5 years. [ Phillips James http://www.heritage.org/Research/MiddleEast/bg76.cfm The Iranian Oil Crisis The Heritage Foundation February 28, 1979 February 25, 2012 ] [ Limitations ] The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is exclusively a crude petroleum reserve, not a stockpile of refined petroleum fuel s, such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene. Although there are small-scale (2,000,000 barrels) heating oil reserves in Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Jersey under the aegis of the Department of Energy (DOE), the federal government maintains no gasoline reserves on anything like the scale of the SPR. Consequently, while the US enjoys some protection from disruptions in oil supplies, it would have to depend on other stockpiling members of the International Energy Agency for relief from any major disruption to refinery operations. Since no new refineries have been constructed in the US for thirty years, there is little excess refining capacity. [ November 2007 ] This was illustrated during Hurricane Katrina, when many of the Gulf coast oil refining complexes were disrupted for some time. There have been suggestions that the DOE should stockpile both gasoline and jet fuel, to rectify this weakness.
