[ Early life and education ] Born in Lexington, Virginia, Mann was the third of three children and the only daughter. Her father, Robert S. Munger, was a general practitioner, and her mother, Elizabeth Evans Munger, ran the bookstore at Washington and Lee University in Lexington. Mann graduated from The Putney School in 1969, and attended Bennington College and Friends World College. She earned a B.A., summa cum laude, from Hollins College (now Hollins University ) in 1974 and a MA in creative writing in 1975. { PBS PBS art:21 - Art in the 21st Century } She took up photography at Putney, where, she claims, her motive was to be alone in the darkroom with her boyfriend. She made her photographic debut at Putney, with an image of a nude classmate. Her father encouraged her interest in photography; His 5x7 camera became the basis of her use of large format cameras today. [ Early career ] After graduation, Mann worked as a photographer at Washington and Lee University. In the mid 1970s she photographed the construction of its new law school building, the Lewis Hall (now the Sydney Lewis Hall), leading to her first one-woman exhibition in late 1977 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. { Archives / Corcoran Gallery of Art } Those surrealistic images were subsequently included as part of her first book, Second Sight, published in 1984. Her second collection, At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women, published in 1988, stimulated controversy. The images “captured the confusing emotions and developing identities of adolescent girls [and the] expressive printing style lent a dramatic and brooding mood to all of her images.” { Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago, IL } Mann is perhaps best known { Corcoran Museum, Washington DC 2004 Exhibition } for Immediate Family, her third collection, published in 1992. The NY Times said, “Probably no photographer in history has enjoyed such a burst of success in the art world.” { Richard B. Woodward, “The Disturbing Photography of Sally Mann.” ‘’The New York Times Magazine’’ cover story, September 27, 1992, page 29. } The book consists of 65 black-and-white photographs of her three children, all under the age of 10. Many of the pictures were taken at the family&apos;s remote summer cabin along the river, where the children played and swam in the nude. Many explore typical childhood themes (skinny dipping, reading the funnies, dressing up, vamping, napping, playing board games) but others touch on darker themes such as insecurity, loneliness, injury, sexuality and death. The controversy on its release was intense, including accusations of child pornography (both in America { “Photo Book Challenged as Indecent”, ‘’The Post-Tribune’’ (Merrillville IN), December 18, 1997. } and abroad { &quot; Sally Mann’s photographs lead to request for police investigation &quot; Helsingin Sanomat, Helsinki, Finland } ) and of contrived fiction with constructed tableaux. One image of her 4-year-old daughter (Virginia at 4) was censored by the Wall Street Journal with black bars over her eyes, nipples and pubic area. { ’’The Wall Street Journal’’, February 6, 1991. “Critique: Censoring Virginia,” By Ray Sokolov, p A10. } Mann herself considered these photographs to be “natural through the eyes of a mother, since she has seen her children in every state: happy, sad, playful, sick, bloodied, angry and even naked.” { Photographers and photography. &quot; Sally Mann: Mother and American Photographer &quot; } Critics agreed, saying her “vision in large measure [is] accurate, and a welcome corrective to familiar notions of youth as a time of unalloyed sweetness and innocence,” { Charles Hagen, “Review/Art; Childhood Without Sweetness.” The New York Times, June 5, 1992. } and that the book “created a place that looked like Eden, then cast upon it the subdued and shifting light of nostalgia, sexuality and death. &quot; { Lyle Rexer, “Art/Architecture; Marriage Under Glass: Intimate Exposures”, ‘’The New York Times, November 10, 2000. } When Time magazine named her “America’s Best Photographer” in 2001, it wrote: Mann recorded a combination of spontaneous and carefully arranged moments of childhood repose and revealingly — sometimes unnervingly — imaginative play. What the outraged critics of her child nudes failed to grant was the patent devotion involved throughout the project and the delighted complicity of her son and daughters in so many of the solemn or playful events. No other collection of family photographs is remotely like it, in both its naked candor and the fervor of its maternal curiosity and care. { Reynolds Price, ‘’Time Magazine’’ July 9, 2001 } The New Republic considered it &quot; one of the great photograph books of our time. &quot; { Luc Sante, Luc Sante on Photography: The Nude and the Naked. The New Republic, May 1, 1995, p 30. } Her fourth book, Still Time, published in 1994, was based on the catalogue of a traveling exhibition that included more than 20 years of her photography. The 60 images included more photographs of her children, but also earlier landscapes with color and abstract photographs. [ Later career ] In the mid 1990s, Mann began photographing landscapes on wet plate collodion 8x10 glass negatives, and again used the same 100-year-old 8 x 10 bellows view camera that she had used for all the previous bodies of work. These landscapes were first seen in Still Time, and later featured in two shows presented by the Edwynn Houk Gallery in NYC: Sally Mann – Mother Land: Recent Landscapes of Georgia and Virginia in 1997, and then in Deep South: Landscapes of Louisiana and Mississippi in 1999. Many of these large (40 &quot; x50 &quot; ) black-and-white and manipulated prints were taken using the 19th century “wet plate” process, or collodion, in which glass plates are coated with collodion, dipped in silver nitrate, and exposed while still wet. This gave the photographs what the New York Times called “a swirling, ethereal image with a center of preternatural clarity, &quot; { Lyle Rexer, &quot; Art/Architecture: Marriage Under Glass: Intimate Exposures &quot;, New York Times, November 19, 2000. } and showed many flaws and artifacts, some from the process and some introduced by Mann. Mann’s fifth book, What Remains, published in 2003, is based on the show of the same name at the Corcoran Museum in Washington, DC and is in five parts. The first section contains photographs of the remains of Eva, her greyhound, after decomposition. The second part has the photographs of dead and decomposing bodies at a federal Forensic Anthropology Facility (known as the ‘body farm’). The third part details the site on her property where an armed escaped convict was killed. The fourth part is a study of the grounds of Antietam, the site of the bloodiest single day battle in American history during the Civil War. The last part is a study of close-ups of the faces of her children. Thus, this study of mortality, decay and death ends with hope and love. { Malcolm Jones, &quot; Love, Death, Light &quot;, Newsweek, September 8, 2003. } Mann’s sixth book, Deep South, published in 2005, with 65 black-and-white images, includes landscapes taken from 1992 to 2004 using both conventional 8x10 film and wet plate collodion. These photographs have been described as “haunted landscapes of the south, battlefields, decaying mansion, kudzu shrouded landscapes and the site where Emmett Till was murdered. &quot; { Malcolm Jones, &quot; Look Books &quot;, Newsweek, November 25, 2005] } &quot; Newsweek &quot; picked it as their book choice for the holiday season, saying that Mann “walks right up to every Southern stereotype in the book and subtly demolishes each in its turn by creating indelibly disturbing images that hover somewhere between document and dream. &quot; Mann&apos;s seventh book, Proud Flesh, published in 2009, is a study taken over six years of the effects of muscular dystrophy on her husband Larry Mann. The project was displayed in Gagosian Gallery in October 2009. Mann&apos;s eighth book, The Flesh and The Spirit, published in 2010, was released in conjunction with a comprehensive show at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia. [ http://www.vmfa.state.va.us/Exhibitions/Sally-Mann-The-Flesh-and-The-Spirit/ Sally Mann: The Flesh And The Spirit Virginia Museum of Fine Arts 11 November 2010 ] Though not a retrospective, this 200 page book includes new and recent work (unpublished self-portraits, landscapes, images of her husband, her children&apos;s faces, and of the dead at a forensic institute) as well as early works (unpublished color photographs of her children in the 1990s, color Polaroids and platinum prints from the 1970s). Its unifying theme is the body, with its vagaries of illnesses and death, and includes essays by John Ravenal, David Levi Strauss and Anne Wilkes Tucker. Her current projects include a series of self-portraits, a multipart study of the legacy of slavery in Virginia, and intimate images of her family and life. { Laura Parsons, &quot; The lyrical lens: Sally Mann’s poetry in stillness &quot;, The Hook, May 10, 2007, Charlottesville, Va.] } The latter, entitled &quot; Marital Trust, &quot; spans 30 years, and includes intimate details of her family life with Larry. { NPR, &quot; From Lens To Photo: Sally Mann Captures Her Love &quot; &quot; All Things Considered, &quot; February 17, 2011. } In May 2011 she delivered the three-day Massey Lecture Series at Harvard. [ Personal life ] Mann has three children: Emmett, born in 1979, who for a time joined the Peace Corps, { Interview to Charlie Rose, 2003 (see External Links) } Jessie (herself an artist, photographer and model), { Jessie Mann&apos;s Web Site } born in 1981, and Virginia (now in law school), born in 1985. Mann lives on a farm in Virginia with her husband, Larry. He is a full time attorney, and has muscular dystrophy, with progressive weakness. Mann is passionate about endurance horse racing. In 2006, Mann&apos;s horse had an aneurysm while she was riding him. In the horse&apos;s death throes, Mann was thrown to the ground and the impact broke her back. It took her two years to recover from the accident and during this time, she made a series of ambrotype self-portraits. These self-portraits were on view for the first time in November 2010 at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts as a part of Sally Mann: the Flesh and the Spirit. { The Serendipitous Moments of Sally Mann } She is currently represented by the Gagosian Gallery of New York City. [ Recognition ] Her works are included in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, { Sally Mann at the Metropolitan Museum of Art } the Corcoran Gallery of Art, { Sally Mann at the Corcoran Gallery of Art } the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, { Sally Mann at the Hirshhorn Museum } the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston, { Sally Mann at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston } the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, { Sally Mann at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art } and the Whitney Museum of New York City among many others. Time magazine named Mann &quot; America&apos;s Best Photographer &quot; in 2001. Photos she took have appeared on the cover of The New York Times Magazine twice: first, a picture of her three children for the September 27, 1992 issue with a feature article on her &quot; disturbing work, &quot; and again on September 9. 2001, with a self-portrait (which also included her two daughters) for a theme issue on &quot; Women Looking at Women. &quot; Mann has been the subject of two film documentaries. The first, Blood Ties, [ Steven Cantor (Director) 1994 Blood Ties Motion picture http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106431/ ] was directed by Steve Cantor, debuted at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival, and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Documentary Short. The second, What Remains [ Steven Cantor (Director) 2005 What Remains Motion picture http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0483836/ ] was also directed by Steve Cantor. It premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Emmy for Best Documentary in 2008. In her New York Times review of the film, Ginia Bellafante wrote, &quot; It is one of the most exquisitely intimate portraits not only of an artist’s process, but also of a marriage and a life, to appear on television in recent memory. &quot; { Ginia Bellafante,&apos;&apos;What Remains: The Life and Works of Sally Mann, &quot; The New York Times, January 31, 2007. } Mann received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree { Jay DeForge, &quot; Corcoran College Awards Sally Mann Honorary Doctorate.
