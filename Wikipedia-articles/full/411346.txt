[ Biography ] Piper was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Bill and Ruth Piper. His father was a traveling evangelist and church planter, and consequently his mother largely raised him. When he and his older sister were still young, the Pipers moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where he spent the remainder of his youth and graduated from Wade Hampton High School. He married Noël Henry in 1968, and together they have four sons, a daughter, and several grandchildren. [ http://www.desiringgod.org/about/john-piper Life Desiring God ] Piper attended Wheaton College (1964–68) majoring in literature and minoring in philosophy. Studying Romantic Literature with Clyde Kilby stimulated his poetic side, [ Piper John The Pastor as Scholar 2011 Crossway Wheaton 978-1-4335-2647-3 30–34 ] and today he regularly composes poetry to celebrate special family occasions as well as annually composing story-poems (based on the life of biblical characters) for his congregation during the four weeks of Advent. [ http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Poems/ByDate/ Poems by Date Desiring God Christian Resource Library ] In college he originally subscribed in the Pre-med program, only to decide to go into ministry during a bout of sickness. Following college, he completed a Bachelor of Divinity degree at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California (1968–71). While at Fuller, he took several courses from Daniel Fuller and through him discovered the writings of Jonathan Edwards. [ Piper John The Pastor as Scholar &amp; the Scholar as Pastor 2011 Crossway Wheaton 978-1-4335-2647-3 39–40 ] Piper did his doctoral work in New Testament Studies at the University of Munich, Germany (1971–74) under Leonhard Goppelt. His dissertation, Love Your Enemies, was published by Cambridge University Press and Baker Book House. Upon completion of his doctorate, he taught Biblical Studies at Bethel University and Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, for six years (1974–80).

His father died on March 6, 2007. [ http://www.desiringgod.org/Blog/536_things_i_have_learned Things I Have Learned Desiring God Blog John Piper March 28, 2007 ] [ Ministry ] In 1980, after what he described as an irresistible call of the Lord to preach, Piper became Pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he has been ministering ever since. Piper was catapulted onto the evangelical scene after the publication of his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986) and has continued to publish dozens of other books further articulating this theological perspective. In 1994, he founded Desiring God Ministries, which today provides all of Piper&apos;s sermons and articles from the past three decades, and most of his books online free of charge, as well as offering for sale books, CDs, and DVDs and regularly hosting conferences. In August 2009, Piper claimed that a wind storm occurring during a conference of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America was a &quot; gentle but firm warning &quot; from God. [ Allen Bob http://www.abpnews.com/content/view/4329/ John Piper says possible tornado a warning to Lutherans August 20, 2009 Associated Baptist Press March 5, 2012 ] He wrote a blog post tying the storm to the ELCA&apos;s consideration of its position on issues concerning homosexuality. [ Piper John http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/the-tornado-the-lutherans-and-homosexuality The Tornado, the Lutherans, and Homosexuality Desiring God August 19, 2009 ] According to Piper, Desiring God Ministries exists to &quot; spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ, &quot; [ http://www.desiringgod.org/AboutUs/ Desiring God exists to say... Desiring God ] which is also his personal motto. Piper calls those who live out this motto Christian Hedonists. He places a heavy emphasis on the objective and absolute nature of truth and is confident in the Christian&apos;s ability to grasp that truth through the guidance of the Holy Spirit. [ March 2010 ] On January 11, 2006, Piper announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. According to a letter sent to his church, [ http://www.desiringgod.org/news_events/dgm_news/2006/20060106_cancer_announcement.html http://web.archive.org/web/20060110183758/http%3A//www.desiringgod.org/news_events/dgm_news/2006/20060106_cancer_announcement.html January 10, 2006 January 6, 2006 John Piper Diagnosed with Prostate Cancer John Piper Desiring God ] he and his doctors believed that the cancer was fully treatable. Piper responded to his diagnosis with the following: &quot; This news has, of course, been good for me. The most dangerous thing in the world is the sin of self-reliance and the stupor of worldliness. The news of cancer has a wonderfully blasting effect on both. I thank God for that. The times with Christ in these days have been unusually sweet. &quot; Piper underwent successful surgery on February 14, 2006. [ http://www.desiringgod.org/Blog/405_cancer_update/ Cancer Update Desiring God Blog John Piper February 3, 2007 ] [ March 2010 ] Piper took an eight-month leave of absence from his ministry from May 1, 2010 to January 9, 2011.

A candidate to succeed him was announced in March 2012. On May 20, 2012 Jason Meyer was voted in (784 Yes to 8 No) to be the next Pastor for Preaching &amp; Vision, replacing John Piper. [ Theological views ] [ Christian hedonism ] [ Christian hedonism ] Piper advocates Christian hedonism and teaches that &quot; God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him &quot; { We Want You to Be a Christian Hedonist! :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } and that God&apos;s highest pursuit ( &quot; his glory &quot; ) and man&apos;s deepest and most durable happiness come together in one pursuit—namely, the pursuit of joy in God. He was awakened to this notion in the writings of Jonathan Edwards, Blaise Pascal, and C. S. Lewis, among others, and then found it throughout the Bible, for example [ Ps 16:11 ]; [ Ps 37:4 ]; [ Phil 3:1 ]; [ Phil 4:4 ] among others. [ Gender roles ] Piper holds to a complementarian view of gender roles. { Recovering: Chapter 2 } This view says that the Bible teaches that a husband is called to lovingly lead, protect and provide for his wife and family, and that the wife should joyfully and intelligently affirm and submit to her husband&apos;s leadership. He also says that the Bible teaches that men are to bear the primary responsibility to lead the church and that therefore only men should be elders. { for a brief overview of the complementarian position see http://www.cbmw.org/Online-Books/Recovering-Biblical-Manhood-and-Womanhood/A-Vision-of-Biblical-Complementarity and http://www.cbmw.org/Online-Books/Fifty-Crucial-Questions/Fifty-Crucial-Questions } Piper along with Wayne Grudem was co-editor of one of the bedrock books in this area called Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. One of the chapters has been reprinted several times as an independent short book called What&apos;s the Difference?. { http://www.cbmw.org/Online-Books/Recovering-Biblical-Manhood-and-Womanhood/A-Vision-of-Biblical-Complementarity } [ Calvinism ] Piper&apos;s soteriology is Calvinist, { What We Believe About the Five Points of Calvinism :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } and his ecclesiology is Baptist. { I Baptize You with Water :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } He affirms the distinctively Calvinist doctrine of double predestination, which includes &quot; unconditional reprobation &quot; or damnation as a corollary to the Augustinian doctrine of unconditional election, and he subscribes to the Leibnizian view that God decreed this universe to be the best of all possible universes. { What does Piper mean when he says he&apos;s a seven-point Calvinist? :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } Piper believes in justification by faith alone apart from any works, { Does James Contradict Paul? :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } and his teachings emphasize the need for the active and inevitable perseverance of the believer in faith, sanctification, and enduring sufferings, which he believes is evidence of God&apos;s saving grace. According to Piper, a once-professing Christian who does not faithfully persevere until the end demonstrates that he was mistaken about his election and was never a true believer in the first place. { Olympic Spirituality, Part 1 :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } { Letter to a Friend Concerning the So-Called &quot; Lordship Salvation &quot; :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } [ Spiritual gifts ] Regarding spiritual gifts, Piper is a continuationist. { Are Signs and Wonders for Today? :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } That is, he believes that supernatural gifts such as prophecy, miracles, healing s, and speaking in tongues have not ceased and should be sought by the church, { Spiritual Gifts and the Sovereignty of God, Panel Discussion :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } in particular with regard to missions and evangelism. He does believe, however, that the office of apostle has ceased { &quot; Jesus chose Twelve Apostles for a unique, unrepeatable role in the history of redemption... there seem to be also another group (or groups) of men called and authorized by Jesus in the New Testament, some of whom are on a par with the Twelve in their teaching authority. Paul certainly believed that his call and commission by the risen Christ put him on a par with the Twelve in his teaching role... &quot; } and that the gift of prophecy in the church is not the same as the inspiration of scripture. { &quot; But the spiritual gift of prophecy is different from the inspiration of Scripture. &quot; } While he believes that God&apos;s supernatural revelation in the N.T. gift of prophecy is without error, he says that today, outside the Biblically recorded Word of God, the prophet&apos;s perception, understanding and delivery of that revelation is imperfect and fallible, { &quot; God reveals something to the mind of the prophet (in some way beyond ordinary sense perception), and since God never makes a mistake, we know that his revelation is true. It has no error in it. But the gift of prophecy does not guarantee the infallible transmission of that revelation. The prophet may perceive the revelation imperfectly, he may understand it imperfectly, and he may deliver it imperfectly. &quot; } thus modern prophecies within the church are subject to sifting. { &quot; We need a third category for the &quot; spiritual gift of prophecy &quot; —Spirit-prompted, Spirit-sustained, revelation-rooted, but mixed with human imperfection and fallibility and therefore in need of sifting. &quot; } [ Eschatology ] Piper describes himself as an &quot; optimistic premillennialist &quot; [ http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/ConferenceMessages/ByDate/2008/3346_Filling_Up_What_Is_Lacking_in_Christs_Afflictions/ Filling Up What Is Lacking in Christ&apos;s Afflictions Desiring God Ministries 2008-10-19 John Piper ] and holds a post-tribulation view of the second coming of Jesus. { Definitions and Observations Concerning the Second Coming of Christ :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } { What Must Happen Before the Day of the Lord? :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } Because of this belief, he maintains that Romans 11 teaches that a mass in-gathering of ethnic Israel will be saved when the hardening of their hearts is removed at Jesus&apos; second coming. { Did Israel Stumble in Order That They Might Fall? :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } He therefore advocates the importance of hoping in the resurrection of the dead at Christ&apos;s return. { What Happens When You Die? The Dead Will Be Raised Imperishable :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } [ Law and covenant ] Piper does not don any of the typical hermeneutical frameworks, but claims he is furthest from dispensationalism, and closest to Covenant Theology, or a New Covenant Theology in matters of the Law and covenants, but agrees with the dispensationalist belief that there will be a millennium. { What does John Piper believe about dispensationalism, covenant theology, and new covenant theology? :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } He says that the Law was meant by God to reveal sin and show man&apos;s inability to live up to God&apos;s righteous standards. { Why Then the Law? :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } Christians, living under the New Covenant, are not under the Old Covenant law but able to fulfill its intent through faith in Jesus Christ. { What Does It Mean to Fulfill the Law in Romans 8:3-4 :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } { Hagar and Slavery Vs. Sarah and Freedom :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } Piper teaches that God has only one covenant people, mostly believing Jews in the Old Testament, and now that relationship has been superseded by the Church. { Israel and Us Reconciled in One Body :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } Thus, the Church is rightful inheritor of all the promises made to ethnic Israel (land, kingdom, etc.), and Jews who reject Jesus as Messiah have no divine right of claim on those promises. { Israel, Palestine and the Middle East :: Desiring God Christian Resource Library } [ Books ] Love Your Enemies: Jesus&apos; Love Command in the Synoptic Gospels and the Early Christian Paraenesis (Cambridge University Press, 1980; Baker, 1991).
