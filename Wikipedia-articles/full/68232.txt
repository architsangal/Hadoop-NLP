BioWare&apos;s Infinity Engine offers a pre-rendered isometric worldview, with sprite -based characters. Baldur&apos;s Gate was also the third computer game ever to make use of the Lua scripting language. The engine was also used for Planescape: Torment and the Icewind Dale series. The games are based on a real-time modification of the second edition AD &amp; D (Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons) ruleset. The player&apos;s party can have up to six members, either created by the player according to the AD &amp; D rules or NPCs recruited by the protagonist from the game world. Numerous side quests and plot twists are associated with particular NPCs and can be activated if they are found in the player&apos;s party. Through extensive, context-dependent dialogue, many characters inside and outside the player&apos;s party are fleshed out and given an added level of complexity. In 1999, Baldur&apos;s Gate won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Computer Game of 1998, and in 2000, Baldur&apos;s Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast won Best Roleplaying Computer Game of 1999. Baldur&apos;s Gate has also been often compared to Diablo (an action RPG ), perhaps for similarities in dungeon-crawling and the isometric view, but is much more story driven with less hack and slash. The Dark Alliance series, which was driven by both story and hack and slash only managed to win one award for Baldur&apos;s Gate: Dark Alliance. In 2001, the game won Game of the Year for Role Playing Games by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal ended up winning the game&apos;s computer counterpart. Baldur&apos;s Gate: Dark Alliance II was awarded the 2004 RPG of the Year Award by GameFan and was inducted in its Hall of Fame in the year 2011. { http://diehardgamefan.com/2011/08/18/diehard-gamefan-hall-of-fame-nominee-baldurs-gate-dark-alliance-2/ } [ Games ] [ Bhaalspawn saga ] [ Baldur&apos;s Gate ] [ Baldur&apos;s Gate Baldur&apos;s Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast ] The first game in the series introduces the player character as a powerless orphan raised in the monastery of Candlekeep, south of Baldur&apos;s Gate and north of the kingdom of Amn. The main character searches for the killer of his or her foster father, Gorion, and becomes involved with the region&apos;s iron crisis which causes metal to crumble, all while battling to stay alive. An expansion pack for Baldur&apos;s Gate, Tales of the Sword Coast did not add anything to the primary storyline, but presented the protagonist with more areas to explore along the Sword Coast, more powerful enemies, more spells, better equipment, and allows the player character to reach higher levels of experience. It also made some general changes to gameplay and altered the original game&apos;s final battle. [ Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn ] [ Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal ] The main character is captured by Jon Irenicus and must escape into the city of Athkatla, the capital of Amn. Here the protagonist faces several different ways to figure out the reason behind the capture as he or she journeys through the region of Amn and the Underdark. The game presents a number of innovations over the first Baldur&apos;s Gate game, including further specialization of character classes, better graphics and higher power levels. It also allowed for more interaction with the game&apos;s joinable NPCs, including friendships, romances, and your own party members&apos; interactions with one another. Throne of Bhaal is an expansion pack for Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, and includes both an expansion of the original game -such as new areas to explore- as well as a conclusion to the Bhaalspawn story arc started in the first Baldur&apos;s Gate game. [ Dark Alliance series ] [ Baldur&apos;s Gate: Dark Alliance ] [ Baldur&apos;s Gate: Dark Alliance ] The action RPG Baldur&apos;s Gate: Dark Alliance was developed by Snowblind Studios and others, and released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 console, and later Xbox and GameCube video game consoles. The game takes place in the city of Baldur&apos;s Gate and surrounding area and is set in the Forgotten Realms setting, with a ruleset derived from the 3rd edition Dungeon and Dragons ruleset; the plot is unrelated to previous PC games.

The gameplay style was expanded to make the game more like an RPG, the ability to craft weapons, armor and amulets was added, Baldur&apos;s Gate became a hub city with the addition of a world map and being able to travel back to areas, making the game open world and many more side-quests were added as well as the ability to level up one&apos;s class. [ Future ] [ Official Games ] Development on Baldur&apos;s Gate III: The Black Hound was cancelled in 2004, the third game in the Dark Alliance series was also cancelled in 2004 when Black Isle Studios was closed in 2004 by parent company Interplay Entertainment Corp. It was announced by Overhaul Games that after finishing the Enhanced Editions of Baldur&apos;s Gate I and II, they would be looking to develop Baldur&apos;s Gate 3 with funding from Kickstarter, much like Wasteland 2 had gotten. { http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/03/20/former-bioware-developer-making-baldurs-gate-3-a-long-term-goal } [ Enhanced Editions ] On the 15th of March 2012, Baldur&apos;s Gate: Enhanced Edition was announced.

[ http://www.gamebanshee.com/interviews/theblackhound1.php The Black Hound Interview Jon &quot; Buck &quot; Birnbaum Gamebanshee.com 2007-02-13 2009-09-15 ] The Black Hound was originally going to be a departure from the high-powered epic of the Bhaalspawn saga to a low-key, roleplaying plot. With protagonists progressing to around level four at the end of BIS&apos; typically enormous campaign and a hard cap at level eight, gameplay was refocussed to a flat and wide adventure emphasizing quests over combat. In fact, the game was only titled &quot; Baldur&apos;s Gate &quot; due to Interplay having lost the general D &amp; D license to Atari, but still retaining the right to make &quot; Baldur&apos;s Gate &quot; and &quot; Icewind Dale &quot; branded D &amp; D games (the same reason as for BGDA &apos;s title.) The game was not going to be connected to the previous Baldur&apos;s Gate series in any way and would start a new series, the Black Hound series. Like Bioshock Infinite it would have been a sequel in terms of gameplay and not story, it would continue some parts of the Icewind Dale II story though. The game was announced in 2002 and was said to have used the 3rd Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons ruleset, the gameplay of the previous Baldur&apos;s Gate games would have been updated to fit the ruleset. Many new gameplay features were also going to be added to fit the 3rd Edition Ruleset better, elements from the Dark Alliance series would have also been borrowed. The game used the Jefferson Engine which featured 3D effects such as casting dynamic shadows. The game was 75% finished before it was canceled. Its cancellation happened due to Interplay losing the right to publish Baldur&apos;s Gate games on the PC yet retaining the Baldur&apos;s Gate name for consoles, the result of this was Baldur&apos;s Gate: Dark Alliance II. The game appeared to be canceled in 2003, just before its engine was re-purposed for Black Isle&apos;s ill-fated Van Buren Fallout 3 project. Subsequently, Josh Sawyer, one of the designers of the canceled game, resumed development of The Black Hound as a module for Neverwinter Nights 2. As of 2009, this remains a side project for Sawyer, who works at Obsidian Entertainment.

[ http://pc.ign.com/articles/504/504160p1.html Baldur&apos;s Gate III, Neverwinter Nights II in Development? IGN 2007-04-02 ] As revealed in an interview with Winterwind Productions, Black Hound developer Damien Foletto revealed the story and setting of the game, which would have been in the Dalelands. The player character would have been resting at his campsite when a lady chasing a Black Hound crashes in, she kills the hound which dies on the player&apos;s lap. Accusing the player of being in league with the dog, she is about to kill the player as well, but the Riders of Archendale arrive and scare her off and question the player. After a brief inquisition, the local magistrates tell the player not to wander far because they may have more questions. And so begins the players quest to find out who the mad cleric was, what this has to do with him/her, why a black spirit hound now follows him/her around, and why can&apos;t people just leave the player character alone and do things for themselves. { http://www.winterwind-productions.com/gaming/foletto_pt2/ } In the January 2008 issue of PC Gamer UK, the editor claims that he knows that Baldur&apos;s Gate III is indeed being worked on - this has further been reiterated in the January 2009 edition.
