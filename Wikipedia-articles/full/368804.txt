Cachaça is Brazil&apos;s most common distilled alcoholic beverage (also known as Pinga or Caninha). Both rum and cachaça are made from sugarcane -derived products.

The word may be used as either a masculine or a feminine noun, but when referring to this drink it is only feminine (usage of diminutives is common in Brazil). In the Brazilian vocabulary, the word caipirinha is mostly associated with the drink itself rather than the class of person. [ Variations ] [ November 2011 ] The term caipirinha is sometimes used to describe any cachaça-and-fruit-juice drink (e.g. a passionfruit caipirinha, kiwi caipirinha or strawberry caipirinha). Caipifruta is a very popular caipirinha drink in Brazil, consisting of cachaça, crushed fresh fruits (either singly or in combination), and crushed ice. The most popular fresh fruits used to create caipifrutas are tangerine, lime, kiwi fruit, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon, grapes, mango, cajá, and caju (cashew fruit). Caipisake (made with sake instead of cachaça) is also becoming increasingly popular, most commonly made with strawberries or kiwi.
