It also serves parts of western Suffolk County, New York as well as eastern portions of the New York City borough of Queens. It was formerly operated under the name of MTA Long Island Bus, the trading name of the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority, a division of MTA Regional Bus Operations. In 2011, the owner, Nassau County, decided to switch the system over to a private operator, Veolia Transportation, due to a funding dispute with the MTA. [ LI Bus gets new name, look, operator says http://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/li-bus-gets-new-name-look-operator-says-1.3309573 Castillo Alfonso November 9, 2011 November 10, 2011 Newsday ] [ History ] [ Private companies (pre-1973) ] The MTA began operating Nassau County bus service in 1973 under the name Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority, through the merging of 11 private operators: Rockville Centre Bus (N14, N15, N16, and N17) Utility Lines (N19; extended to Patchogue along current S40 [Suffolk Transit] route) Stage Coach Lines (N71, N73, N74, and earlier N70): NOTE: The N70 under Stage Coach was a loop route from Hempstead to Levittown, Bellmore, Wantagh, and back to Hempstead. Mid-Island Transit (N78, N79, N80, N81): This operator was acquired by Stage Coach, which would be acquired by Bee-Line. Also operated by this operator was a route from today&apos;s Broadway Mall to Oyster Bay. { Schenck Transportation (N20, N21, N22, N23, N24, N25, N26, N27) and previously acquired: } Nassau Bus Line (N31, N32, N33) Universal Auto Bus (N57 and N58) { Jerusalem Avenue Bus Line (N51, N54, N55) and a now-discontinued Massapequa Park circulator (old N53) } { Hempstead Bus Corporation (N35, N36, N37 [merged into N35], N40, N41, N45, N47, N48, N49) } { Roosevelt Bus Line (N62) } { Branch Bus Corporation (N69; transferred to Long Beach in 1984) } { Hendrickson Bus Corporation (N67, discontinued January 1975) } [ MTA Long Island Bus ] right In the 1980s, the N28 (now discontinued), N46, N50, and N70 (as an N72 branch) were instituted as new routes, with the N20 extended to Hicksville. The 1990s saw the creation of a shuttle around Roosevelt Field (N93, now discontinued), two shuttles designed to take customers from train stations to work sites (the N94 and N95, both discontinued), and a service connecting Nassau County to JFK Airport (the N91, now discontinued), with the 2000s seeing a Merrick shuttle (now discontinued) and the N8 and N43 routes being created. In 2007, Long Island Bus averaged over 109,000 weekday riders, many of which include customers connecting to other MTA services in the region. [ Privatization ] [ Ed Mangano#Long Island Bus controversy ] In 2010, the future of MTA Long Island Bus became uncertain, as the MTA threatened drastic cuts due to Nassau County&apos;s disproportionately small contributions to the operation. For the past decade, the MTA has provided a unique subsidy (of $24 million in 2011 and over $140 million since 2000) to the Nassau County bus system that the other New York City suburban county bus systems have not received. [ http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/nyregion/28towns.html The New York Times Peter Applebome March 27, 2011 February 23, 2012 ] The county&apos;s contribution was $9.1 million per year out of a total budget of $133.1 million, and the MTA desired that this contribution increase to $26 million. Critics have noted that Westchester County subsidized its similarly-sized Bee-Line Bus System service by $33 million/year, and that Suffolk subsidizes its substantially smaller Suffolk County Transit system by $24 million/year. The county hoped to reduce its contribution from $9.1 million to $4.1 million by using a private contractor; [ Nassau Bus Riders May Get Reprieve on Service Cuts http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/nyregion/02bus.html 4 April 2011 The New York Times 2 April 2011 A17 ] the planned county contribution was later decreased to $2.5 million/year. { http://www.longislandpress.com/2012/02/21/bus-rider-advocates-oppose-planned-cuts/ } By March 2011, the MTA proposed a set of major service reductions which will eliminate over half of the routes, with the greatest impact on southeastern Nassau County, eliminating all routes operating south of Hempstead Turnpike and east of the Meadowbrook State Parkway (except for the N71), citing Nassau&apos;s refusal to pay its contracted amount. [ MTA Long Island bus faces deepest cuts http://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/mta-plans-to-cut-most-of-li-bus-routes-1.2723257 Castillo Alfonso March 2, 2011 April 20, 2011 Newsday ] After reviewing the service cut plans, County Executive Ed Mangano considered severing ties with the MTA and privatizing the Long Island Bus system. [ Nassau: Private company to run LI Bus http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/nassau-private-company-to-run-li-bus-1.2764369 Castillo Alfonso March 16, 2011 March 20, 2011 Newsday ] A temporary reprieve, via additional state funding, would sustain service through the end of 2011.

Mangano then announced that he had retained Veolia Transportation to operate the system beginning in 2012 through a public-private partnership pending legislative approval.

All buses, including Able-Ride vehicles, will be painted into a new paint scheme to reflect the change. On December 12, 2011, the legislature unanimously approved the Veolia contract, which was subsequently approved by the state-controlled Nassau County Interim Finance Authority (NIFA) on December 22, 2011. Veolia began operations January 1, 2012. This Veolia privatisation plan was the subject of heated county public hearings in which Long Island Bus riders and employees criticized the plan. { http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/crowd-at-hearing-pans-nassau-s-li-bus-plan-1.3368630 } { http://www.liherald.com/stories/County-hearing-gets-heated-over-LI-Bus-,36645 } In February 2012, Veolia announced planned service cuts and adjustments to take effect in April. While there are no route cancellations planned, just over $7 million in cuts to existing routes are planned, with service reductions and route concentrations planned for routes primarily serving northern and eastern Nassau County, beginning in spring 2012, with resources redirected towards busier routes. These planned cuts have been criticized as occurring too soon, only six weeks after starting service. [ Fare ] The current fare is $ 2.25 ($1.10 for seniors and disabled customers), and can be paid with the MTA&apos;s MetroCard (including unlimited cards) or coins. Students with ID receive a discount of $0.25 from the base fare. Dollar bills are not accepted on any NICE fixed-route buses. Transfers are available upon request with coins, and are included automatically with MetroCard. The transfers are valid for two hours and can be used on two connecting NICE routes. They are also valid on Suffolk County Transit, Long Beach Bus, or Huntington Area Rapid Transit (HART) with the following restrictions: Transfers to non-MetroCard buses are with coins only. Transfers to the New York City Subway, or New York City Bus or MTA Bus express service, are available with MetroCard only (express buses require additional fare). Transfers from Suffolk Transit/HART or Long Beach Bus require payment of a &quot; step-up &quot; fare, which is the difference between the base fares of the systems. The Able-Ride paratransit fare is $3.75, payable in Able-Ride tickets or exact fare. [ Bus depots ] Nassau Inter-County Express operates from three garages in Nassau County, as listed below. Also below are the former depot logos that were used by the MTA.

Routes are designated &quot; N &quot; for Nassau County, with service provided daily (although not all routes operate 7 days a week), and 24-hour service provided on the N4 Merrick Road and N6 Hempstead Turnpike routes. NICE routes operating to Jamaica and Flushing, Queens operate closed-door service in Queens (that is, local service is not provided solely for travel within Queens; appropriate NYC Transit or MTA Bus services must be used instead). There are two exceptions to this: the N24, where one side of Jericho Turnpike/Jamaica Avenue is in New York City, but the other side of the street is in the Town of Hempstead (eastbound drop-off begins at 225 Street, where state maintenance of Jamaica Avenue begins, and westbound pickups occur as far west as 239 Street); and the N31/N32 and N33, which operate open-door in a portion of Far Rockaway where no other bus service is available. In addition, the N33 operates closed-door within the City of Long Beach, where local service is provided by Long Beach Bus.
