[ Fisher R, van Emde Boas W, Blume W, Elger C, Genton P, Lee P, Engel J Epileptic seizures and epilepsy: definitions proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) Epilepsia 46 4 470–2 2005 15816939 http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.66104.x 10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.66104.x ] The outward effect can be as dramatic as a wild thrashing movement (tonic-clonic seizure) or as mild as a brief loss of awareness (absence seizure). It can manifest as an alteration in mental state, tonic or clonic movements, convulsion s, and various other psychic symptoms (such as déjà vu or jamais vu ). Sometimes it is not accompanied by convulsions but a full body &quot; slump &quot;, where the person simply will lose body control and slump to the ground. The medical syndrome of recurrent, unprovoked seizures is termed epilepsy, but seizures can occur in people who do not have epilepsy. For more information, see non-epileptic seizure. About 4% of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80 and the chance of experiencing a second seizure is between 30% and 50%. [ 10.1007/s11940-004-0016-5 Herman ST. 2004 Single Unprovoked Seizures Curr Treat Options Neurol 6 3 243–255 15043807 ] [ Hosey MM Tao M Protein kinases of rabbit and human erythrocyte membranes. Solubilization and characterization. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 482 2 348–57 1977 18184 ] Treatment may reduce the chance of a second one by as much as half. Most single episode seizures are managed by primary care physicians (emergency or general practitioners), whereas investigation and management of ongoing epilepsy is usually done by neurologists. Difficult-to-manage epilepsy may require consultation with an epileptologist, a neurologist with an interest in epilepsy. [ Classification ] [ Seizure types ] Clinicians organize different types of seizure according to whether the source of the seizure within the brain is localized (partial- or focal-onset seizures) or distributed (generalized seizures). Partial seizures are further divided on the extent to which consciousness is affected ( simple partial seizures and complex partial seizures ). If consciousness is unaffected, then it is a simple partial seizure; otherwise it is a complex partial seizure. A partial seizure may spread within the brain—a process known as secondary generalization. Generalized seizures are divided according to the effect on the body, but all involve loss of consciousness. These include absence, myoclonic, clonic, tonic, tonic–clonic, and atonic seizures. A mixed seizure is defined as the existence of both generalized and partial seizures in the same patient.

Neurol. 12 3 220–4 1995 April 7619188 10.1016/0887-8994(95)00021-7 ] Following standardization proposals published [ July 2011 ] in 1970, outdated terms such as &quot; petit mal &quot;, &quot; grand mal &quot;, &quot; Jacksonian &quot;, &quot; psychomotor &quot;, and &quot; temporal-lobe seizure &quot; have fallen into disuse. [ Signs and symptoms ] The signs and symptoms of seizures vary depending on the type. Seizures may cause involuntary changes in body movement or function, sensation, awareness, or behavior. Seizures are often associated with a sudden and involuntary contraction of a group of muscles and loss of consciousness. However, a seizure can also be as subtle as a fleeting numbness of a part of the body, a brief or long term loss of memory, visual changes, sensing/discharging of an unpleasant odor, a strange epigastric sensation, or a sensation of fear and total state of confusion. A seizure can last from a few seconds to status epilepticus, a continuous group of seizures that is often life-threatening without immediate intervention. Therefore seizures are typically classified as motor, sensory, autonomic, emotion al or cognitive. After the active portion of a seizure, there is typically a period referred to as postictal before a normal level of consciousness returns. In some cases, the full onset of a seizure event is preceded by some of the sensations described above, called vertiginous epilepsy. These sensations can serve as a warning to that a generalized tonic–clonic seizure is about to occur. These warning sensations are cumulatively called an aura and are due to a focal seizure. Some patients are able to tell when a seizure is about to happen. Some symptoms experienced by the person before a seizure may include dizziness, lightheadedness, tightening of the chest, and some experience things in slow-motion just prior to the seizure. Symptoms experienced by a person during a seizure depend on where in the brain the disturbance in electrical activity occurs. Partial and frontal seizures and focal epileptic discharges tend to happen more during sleep than during wakefulness. In contrast, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are rare between midnight and 6 a m. and never occur during sleep. [ 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1997.tb01077.x Bazil CW Walczak TS. 1997 Effects of sleep and sleep stage on epileptic and nonepileptic seizures Epilepsia 38 1 56–62 9024184 ] Generalized epilepsy but not focal epilepsy is higher in the morning probably reflecting a diurnal variation in cortical excitability. [ Badawy RA MacDonell RA Jackson GD Berkovic SF Why do seizures in generalized epilepsy often occur in the morning? Neurology 73 3 218–22 2009 19620610 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181ae7ca6 ] A person having a tonic–clonic seizure may cry out, lose consciousness and fall to the ground, and convulse, often violently. A person having a complex partial seizure may appear confused or dazed and will not be able to respond to questions or direction. Some people have seizures that are not noticeable to others. Sometimes, the only clue that a person is having an absence seizure is rapid blinking, extreme confusion for a few seconds or sometimes into hours. [ December 2008 ] [ Causes ] [ Seizure trigger ] Unprovoked seizures are often associated with epilepsy and related seizure disorder s. Causes of provoked seizures include: [ August 2010 ] Dehydration sleep deprivation cavernoma or cavernous malformation is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages. An MRI can quickly confirm or reject this as a cause. arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages. An MRI can quickly confirm or reject this as a cause. head injury may cause non-epileptic post-traumatic seizures or post-traumatic epilepsy, in which the seizures chronically recur. intoxication with drugs, for example aminophylline or local anaesthetics normal doses of certain drugs that lower the seizure threshold, such as tricyclic antidepressant s infection, such as encephalitis or meningitis fever leading to febrile convulsions (but see above) metabolic disturbances, such as hypoglycaemia, hyponatremia or hypoxia withdrawal from drugs ( anticonvulsant s, antidepressant s, and sedative s such as alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines,) space-occupying lesions in the brain ( abscess es, tumor s ) seizures during (or shortly after) pregnancy can be a sign of eclampsia. seizures in a person with hydrocephalus may indicate severe shunt failure. binaural beat brainwave entrainment may trigger seizures in both epileptics and non-epileptics haemorrhagic stroke can occasionally present with seizures, embolic strokes generally do not (though epilepsy is a common later complication); cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare type of stroke, is more likely to be accompanied by seizures than other types of stroke multiple sclerosis sufferers may rarely experience seizures Some medications produce an increased risk of seizures and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) deliberately sets out to induce a seizure for the treatment of major depression. Many seizures have unknown causes. Seizures which are provoked are not associated with epilepsy, and people who experience such seizures are normally not diagnosed with epilepsy. However, the seizures described above resemble those of epilepsy both outwardly, and on EEG testing. Seizures can occur after a subject witnesses a traumatic event. This type of seizure is known as a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure and is related to posttraumatic stress disorder. [ Diagnosis ] Only about 25 percent of people who have a seizure or develop status epilepticus have epilepsy. [ Stasiukyniene V. Pilvinis V. Reingardiene D. Janauskaite L. [Epileptic seizures in critically ill patients] Medicina (Kaunas) 45 6 501–7 2009 19605972 ] It is important to distinguish primary epileptic seizures from secondary causes. Blood tests, lumbar puncture or toxicology screening can be helpful in specific circumstances suggestive of an underlying cause like alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, meningitis or drug overdose, but there is insufficient evidence to support their routine use in the work-up of an adult with an apparently unprovoked first seizure.

MRI is more sensitive in a first apparently unprovoked seizure. [ Physical examination ] Most patients are in a postictal state following a seizure. In this state they are drowsy and often confused. There may be signs of other injuries. A small study found that finding a bite to the side of the tongue was very helpful when present: while only a quarter of those with seizures had such a bite ( sensitivity of 24%), the finding was very specific for seizures, with only 1% due to other causes ( specificity of 99%).

They can identify background epileptogenic activity, as well as help identify causes of seizures. [ Determining the underlying cause ] Additional diagnostic methods include CT Scan ning and MRI imaging or angiography. These may show structural lesions within the brain and heart, but the majority of those with epilepsy show nothing unusual. As seizures have a broad differential diagnosis, it is common for patients to be simultaneously investigated for cardiac and endocrine causes. Checking glucose levels, for example, is a mandatory action in the management of seizures as hypoglycemia may cause seizures, and failure to administer glucose would be harmful to the patient. Other causes typically considered are syncope and cardiac arrhythmia s, and occasionally panic attack s and cataplexy. In addition, 5% of patients with a positive tilt table test may have seizure-like activity that seems to be due to cerebral hypoxia. [ Passman R, Horvath G, Thomas J, et al. Clinical spectrum and prevalence of neurologic events provoked by tilt table testing Arch. Intern. Med. 163 16 1945–8 2003 12963568 10.1001/archinte.163.16.1945 ] For more information, see non-epileptic seizures. [ Differential ] Differentiating an epileptic seizure from other conditions such as syncope can be difficult. Other possible conditions that can mimic a seizure include: decerebrate posturing, psychogenic seizures, dystonia, migraine headache s, and strychnine poisoning. [ Management ] Potentially sharp or dangerous objects should also be moved from the vicinity, so that the individual is not hurt. After the seizure if the person is not fully conscious and alert, they should be placed in the recovery position. A seizure longer than five minutes is a medical emergency. Caregivers may carry medicine. [ Medication ] The treatment of choice for someone who is actively seizing is lorazepam. This may be repeated if there is no effect after 10 minutes. If there is no effect after two doses, barbiturate s or propofol may be used. Ongoing medication is not typically needed after a first seizure and is generally only recommended after a second has occurred or those with structural lesions in the brain. However, in severe cases where patients experience frequent unpredictable seizures everyday, the use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are recommended to reduce the likelihood and duration of seizures. Approximately 70% of the patients could have the seizures fully under control with continuous use of medication. The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggests patients taking only one type of AEDs at a time.

[ Prognosis ] In adults, after 6 months seizure free, after a first seizure the risk of a subsequent seizure in the next year is less than 20% regardless of treatment.
