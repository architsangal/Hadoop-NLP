The village is surrounded on three sides by the high moors which are called Marsden Moor and Meltham Moor although Saddleworth Moor is very close. Saddleworth Moor is known for the place of burial for the moors murders. Marsden has low level access only from the east up the Colne Valley. Several generations of tracks and roads have crossed the moors at this point. There are two distinctive packhorse bridge s in the town (Mellor Bridge by the church, and Close Gate Bridge at the edge of the moor to the east of the village), whilst the current A62 main road crosses through the Standedge cutting some 2.5 miles (4  km) to the west. Both the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Huddersfield to Manchester railway also pass through Marsden, entering the parallel rail and canal Standedge Tunnels about half a mile (0.8  km) to the west of the town. Marsden station is located in the village on the railway line. Marsden Moor Estate, which surrounds Marsden to the west and south, is in the care of the National Trust (NT). The estate, and several reservoirs also to be found on the moors, form an area of beautiful scenery ideal for walking and cycling. Moor management is not an established science/craft, so the NT are breaking new ground in developing new techniques to rehabilitate the moor.
