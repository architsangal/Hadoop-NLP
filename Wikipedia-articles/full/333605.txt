Cantwell (born October 13, 1958) is the junior United States Senator from the state of Washington and a member of the Democratic Party. She previously served in the Washington House of Representatives, and then in the United States House of Representatives from [ Washington 1 ] from 1993 to 1995, after which she worked as an executive for RealNetworks. She is Washington&apos;s second female senator, after Patty Murray. [ Early life ] Cantwell was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was raised in a predominantly Irish-American neighborhood on the south side of Indianapolis. Her father, Paul F. Cantwell, { 1 } served as county commissioner, city councilman, state legislator, and Chief of Staff for U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs, Jr. Her mother, Rose M., was an administrative assistant. Her ancestry includes Irish and German. She attended Emmerich Manual High School and was inducted into the Indianapolis Public School Hall of Fame in 2006. { IPS Hall of Fame } After high school, Cantwell went to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Administration. She moved to Seattle, Washington in 1983 to campaign for Alan Cranston in his unsuccessful bid for the 1984 Democratic Presidential nomination. She then moved to the Seattle suburb of Mountlake Terrace because it reminded her of Indianapolis, and led a successful campaign to build a new library there. [ Early political career ] In 1986, Cantwell was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives at the age of 28. In her campaign, she embarked on an extensive door-knocking effort in her district. [ https://www.olywa.net/ywcaofolympia/maria%20cantwell.html 2002 Woman of Distinction The YWCA of Olympia ] As a state representative, she helped write Washington&apos;s Growth Management Act of 1990, which required cities to develop comprehensive growth plans, and she negotiated its passage. She also worked on legislation regulating nursing homes. In 1992, Cantwell became the first Democrat elected to the United States House of Representatives from Washington&apos;s first congressional district in 40 years. During her only term, she helped convince the Clinton administration to drop its support of the Clipper chip, voted in support of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and supported President Clinton&apos;s 1993 budget. Republican Rick White used that vote to narrowly defeat her in the Republican landslide of 1994. [ In the private sector ] After her defeat, Cantwell vowed to leave politics. Political ally Rob Glaser offered her a job as vice president of marketing for RealNetworks. Among her accomplishments was the live internet streaming broadcast of a Mariners - Yankees baseball game in 1995. (Cantwell is an avid Mariners fan.) In 1998, the company faced heavy criticism because privacy groups alleged that the RealJukebox software program incorporated spyware to track unsuspecting users&apos; listening patterns and download history. In response, RealNetworks amended its privacy policy to fully disclose its privacy practices regarding user listening patterns. Subsequently, RealNetworks submitted to independent outside audits of its privacy practices. Several lawsuits regarding the alleged privacy violations were settled out of court. This incident has in part formed her views on privacy and thus her opposition to the Bush administration&apos;s post-9/11 policies. [ Rosen Jeffrey Jeffrey Rosen The Naked Crowd: Reclaiming Security and Freedom in an Anxious Age 1st Trade Paperback 2004 Random House New York 0-375-75985-9 139 The Path of the Law ] Cantwell became a multimillionaire with the stock options from RealNetworks. In August 2000, during her Senate campaign, Cantwell sold about 110,000 shares of RealNetworks stock at around $44/share. [ 2000 campaign ] At the urging of party activists and officials, Cantwell formed an exploratory committee in October 1999 to consider a run for United States Senate against Democrat Deborah Senn and incumbent Republican Slade Gorton. She committed to run for the position on January 19, 2000. [ Primary ] Cantwell entered the campaign a year after Senn; she quickly lost the endorsements by the Washington State Labor Council and NARAL to Senn. Early on, privacy became an issue. Senn cited her record protecting medical privacy as insurance commissioner. Cantwell promoted internet privacy and cited her opposition to the Clipper chip. In her television advertisement late in the campaign, Senn accused Cantwell of avoiding debates. Cantwell had agreed to two debates; Senn preferred more. They ended up having three debates, during which the candidates harshly attacked each other. Senn attacked RealNetworks and Cantwell&apos;s role in the company. Cantwell accused Senn of wanting to run against RealNetworks and said that Senn was uninformed on internet issues. Cantwell secured the endorsements of the Seattle Times, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the Spokesman-Review, and the News Tribune. She easily won her party&apos;s nomination, defeating Senn 3–1 in the primary. Although he won renomination, Slade Gorton got fewer votes than Cantwell and Senn&apos;s combined total. Cantwell cited this result as evidence that Washington was ready for a change. [ General election ] Social security, prescription drugs, dams, and campaign finance reform were among the most important issues in Cantwell&apos;s race against Gorton. Cantwell also adopted the slogan, &quot; your voice for a change, &quot; a veiled reference to Gorton&apos;s campaign theme in 1980, challenging incumbent Warren Magnuson &apos;s age. She claimed Gorton supported &quot; 19th century solutions to 21st century problems. &quot; Cantwell won the endorsements of The Seattle Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the state&apos;s two biggest newspapers. Gorton won the endorsements of the smaller Tri-City Herald and the News Tribune. At times the campaign was accused of pettiness. After a Cantwell campaign worker deep-linked to a humorous photo on the Gorton website, Gorton accused Cantwell&apos;s campaign of hacking his website, and Senn accused Cantwell of hypocrisy. &quot; Fiddling with people&apos;s websites and calling it good fun... adds a very childish and unworthy character to the race, &quot; said Senn&apos;s campaign spokeswoman Barbara Stenson.

Early on, Cantwell enjoyed a lead, and TV networks projected a Cantwell victory. As absentee ballots streamed in, Gorton overtook Cantwell and achieved a lead of 15,000 votes. When the heavily Democratic Puget Sound region finished counting ballots and the county totals were certified on November 23, Cantwell had regained the lead; she was ahead by 1,953 votes out of 2.5 million cast, about 0.08%. A mandatory recount increased her lead to 2,229 votes, or 0.09%. In 2000, Maria Cantwell and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan became the first women to defeat incumbent senators. [ Campaign finance ] Cantwell spent over $10 million of her own money on her campaign, pledging not to accept money from PAC s. When RealNetworks stock declined at the end of 2000, she spent time raising funds for debt retirement, although she kept her pledge not to accept PAC money, as documented by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

After review, the Federal Election Commission sent a letter of admonishment, saying that the loans were &quot; made on a basis that assures repayment and that each loan bore the usual and customary interest rate. &quot; [ http://www.fec.gov/press/press2004/20040223murs.html MUR 5198 Federal Election Commission 2004-02-23 2006-11-07 ] [ 2006 re-election campaign ] [ Washington United States Senate election, 2006 ] The close 2004 gubernatorial race between Democrat Christine Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi suggested to many that the 2006 contest might go either way.

However, when Cantwell ran as a challenger for the Senate against the incumbent Slade Gorton in 2000, Gorton only agreed to two debates of a similar format. In another comparison, when Washington&apos;s Senior Senator Patty Murray ran for re-election in 2004, she only agreed to two debates with George Nethercutt, although both debates lasted one hour.

Her October 10, 2002, press release, however, quotes her as stating on the floor of the U.S. Senate, &quot;... Mr. President, my vote for this resolution does not mean that I am convinced of the Administration has answered all the questions. I believe the following issues must be addressed before the U.N. or the U.S. move forward with military action. &quot; Cantwell detailed six specific areas in which her questions and concerns had yet to be satisfactorily addressed at the time of her vote to authorize war: &quot; First: Continued Multilateral Approach...

On the issue of abortion, Cantwell calls herself &quot; 100% pro-choice &quot;, and she consistently supports the positions of the pro-choice movement. She was one of 34 senators to vote against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which passed and was signed into law by President Bush on November 5, 2003, and has been ruled against by multiple federal courts before finally being upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. She also voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which made it an additional crime to kill or harm a fetus during a criminal assault upon the mother. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 61–38, and was signed into law by President Bush on April 1, 2004.

Others argued that due to the state&apos;s unique economy, any senator from Washington almost had to vote for free trade pacts. Her votes on CAFTA, the PATRIOT Act, and Iraq prompted a 2006 Democratic primary challenge from Hong Tran, a Seattle legal aid attorney, and a third party challenge from Aaron Dixon, the former captain of the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party. Citing his potential views on abortion and the environment, Cantwell was one of 22 senators to vote against United States Supreme Court nominee John Roberts. In December 2005, Cantwell scored what many perceived as one of the strongest victories of her first term when she blocked Alaska senator Ted Stevens &apos; efforts to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Stevens attached the measure to a bill that provided money for defense spending and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.
