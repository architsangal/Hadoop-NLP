Incest in the Bible does not entirely overlap with the definition of incest in many modern nations. A few books of the Bible, particularly the early parts of the Torah, contain narrative s in which certain individuals, from the same family as one another, engage in sexual intercourse together; while this could be construed as incest, endogamy is an alternative interpretation. The Bible does not, for example, forbid cousin s from marrying, but it does prohibit sexual relations with several other close relatives. [ Definition ] In ancient times, tribal nations preferred endogamous marriage - marriage to one&apos;s relatives; [ incest http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid%3D126%26amp%3Bletter%3DI ] the ideal marriage was usually that to a cousin, and it was often forbidden for an eldest daughter to even marry outside the family. Marriage to a half-sister, for example, is considered incest by most nations today, but was common behaviour for Egyptian pharaoh s; similarly, the Book of Genesis portrays Sarah as marrying Abraham, her half-brother, without criticising the close genetic relationship between them, [ Genesis 20:12 ] and the Book of Samuel treats the marriage of a royal prince to his sister as unusual, [ 2 Samuel 13:13 ] rather than wicked. The issue of consanguinity is thus a complicated one, and the exact definition of incest varies throughout the Bible and Rabbinical literature. The Holiness Code of Leviticus elaborates in detail the relationships it regards as incestuous unions, [ Leviticus 18:7-11 ] and two chapters later specifies punishments for specific incestuous unions, but this second list of unions is much shorter than the first; [ Leviticus 20:11-21 ] textual scholars regard these two lists as having originally been independent documents, bound together at a later point. [ Leviticus L &amp; artid=301 ] { Richard Elliott Friedman, } { Who Wrote the Bible? (1987) } [ Leviticus Leviticus-Lord ] The Deuteronomic Code, gives a yet more simple list of forbidden relationships - just parent&apos;s daughter (including sister), father&apos;s wife (including mother), and mother-in-law. [ Deuteronomy 22:30 ] [ Deuteronomy 27:20-23 ] These lists only mention relationships with female relatives; excluding lesbianism, this implies that the list is addressed to men. These lists of forbidden unions compare as follows (the relations highlighted in red are those that are forbidden): Leviticus 18 Leviticus 20 Deuteronomy Grandfather&apos;s wife (including grandmother) Father&apos;s wife Mother Stepmother Mother-in-law Aunt Parent&apos;s sister Uncle&apos;s wife Father&apos;s brother&apos;s wife Mother&apos;s brother&apos;s wife Parent&apos;s daughter Half-sister (mother&apos;s side) Father&apos;s daughter Sister Half-sister (father&apos;s side) Step sister Sister-in-law (if the wife was still alive) Niece Wife&apos;s daughter Daughter Stepdaughter Daughter-in-law Wife&apos;s child&apos;s daughter (including granddaughter) One of the most notable features of all the lists is that sexual activity between a man and his own daughter is not explicitly forbidden, although the first relation mentioned after the Levitical prohibition of sex with &quot; near kin &quot; is that of &quot; thy father. &quot; [ Leviticus 18:6-7 ] { cf. } [ Deuteronomy 22:30 ] The talmud argues that this absence is because the prohibition was obvious, especially given the proscription against a relationship with a granddaughter, { Yebamot 3a } although some biblical scholars have instead proposed that it was originally in the list, but was then accidentally left out from the copy on which modern versions of the text ultimately depend, due to a mistake by the scribe. [ marriage Manius-Mash ] The second list in the Holiness code noticeably differs from the first by not including the closer relatives, and it might be assumed that obviousness is the explanation here as well. Apart from the case of the daughter, the first incest list in the Holiness code roughly produces the same rules as were followed in early (pre-Islamic) Arabic culture; in Islam, these pre-existing rules were made statutory. The rules in this list are, however, ignored in several prominent cases in the Torah - Jacob is described as having married his first wife&apos;s sister, [ Genesis 29:16 ] [ Genesis 29:23 ] [ Genesis 29:28 ] and Abraham as having a father in common with Sarah (rather than a mother, which would have been permitted by the list). Ezekiel implies that, in his time, marriage between a man and his stepmother, or his daughter-in-law, or his sister, were frequent. [ Ezekiel 22:10-11 ] This situation seems to be the target of the Deuteronomic version of the incest prohibition, which only addresses roughly the same three issues (though prohibiting the mother-in-law in place of the daughter-in-law). Early rabbinic commentators instead argue that the Deuteronomic list is so short because the other possible liaisons were obviously prohibited, and these three were the only liaisons difficult to detect, on account of the fact that, in their day, a man&apos;s stepmother, half-sister, and mother-in-law usually lived in the same house as the man (prior to any liaison). { Samuel ben Meir, Commentary, ad loc. } [ Gender-specific rules ] The biblical lists are not symmetrical - the implied rules for women are not the same. Ignoring family members involved in homosexual liaisons (for the sake of simplicity), they compare as follows (blue = forbidden for men only, red = forbidden for women only, purple = forbidden for both men and women): Leviticus 18 Leviticus 20 Deuteronomy Grandparent&apos;s spouse (including other grandparent) Parent&apos;s spouse Parent Stepparent Parent-in-law Uncle/Aunt Parent&apos;s sibling Uncle&apos;s/Aunt&apos;s spouse Father&apos;s sibling&apos;s spouse Mother&apos;s sibling&apos;s spouse Parent&apos;s child Half-sibling (mother&apos;s side) Father&apos;s child Sibling Half-sibling (father&apos;s side) Step sibling Sibling-in-law (if the spouse was still alive) Nephew/Niece Sibling&apos;s child Nephew/Niece-in-law Spouse&apos;s brother&apos;s child Spouse&apos;s sister&apos;s child Spouse&apos;s child Child Stepchild Child-in-law Spouse&apos;s grandchild (including grandchild) [ Specific incestuous relationships in the Bible ] [ Genesis 9:20-27 9 ] In, Ham saw his father Noah&apos;s nakedness. The Talmud suggests that Ham may have sodomized Noah (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 70a). In more recent times, some scholars have suggested that Ham may have had intercourse with his father&apos;s wife. Frederick W. Bassett, &quot; Noah&apos;s nakedness and the curse of Canaan : a case of incest? &quot; VT 21 [1971] p 232-237. John S. Bergsma and Scott Hahn, &quot; Noah&apos;s nakedness and the curse on Canaan (Genesis 9:20-27), &quot; JBL 124 [2005] p 25-40. [ Genesis 11:29 9 ] Abraham&apos;s brother Nahor married his niece Milcah, the daughter of his other brother Haran. [ Genesis 19:30-38 9 ] [ Genesis 19:32-35 9 ] In, living in an isolated area after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot&apos;s two daughters conspired to inebriate and seduce their father due to the lack of available partners. Because of intoxication, Lot &quot; perceived not &quot; when his firstborn, and the following night his younger daughter, lay with him. ( ) The two children born were directly Lot&apos;s sons and indirectly his grandsons, being his daughters&apos; sons. Likewise, their sons were also their half-brothers, having the same father. [ February 2012 ] In one of the tales of a wife confused for a sister, Abraham admitted that his wife Sarah is also his half-sister, on his father&apos;s side. However, in the rabbinic literature, Sarah is considered Abraham&apos;s niece (the daughter of his brother, Haran). [ Genesis 24:15 9 ] [ Genesis 28:9 9 ] [ Genesis 29 9 ] Abraham&apos;s son Isaac married Rebekah, his first cousin once removed, the granddaughter of his father&apos;s brother Nahor and niece Milcah. Isaac and Rebekah&apos;s firstborn son Esau married his cousin Mahalah, daughter of his father&apos;s brother Ishmael, while their second son Jacob married his cousins Leah and Rachel, daughters of his mother&apos;s brother Laban. Marriage of cousins was not forbidden in biblical law. [ Genesis 35:22 9 ] In, Jacob&apos;s firstborn son Reuben committed incest by sleeping with his father&apos;s concubine Bilhah. [ Genesis 38 9 ] In Genesis 38, Judah, the fourth son of Jacob, mistook his daughter-in-law Tamar for a prostitute while she was veiled, and had sex with her. [ Exodus 6:20 9 ] The biblical character Amram married his paternal aunt, Jochebed, the mother of Aaron and Moses. [ 2 Samuel 13 9 ] [ 2 Samuel 13:13 9 ] [ February 2012 ] In the book of 2nd Samuel, Amnon, King David &apos;s eldest son and heir to the throne, raped his beautiful half-sister Tamar; Tamar&apos;s brother, Absalom, learned of the incident and, two years later, ordered his servants to have Amnon killed. It is noteworthy that when pleading in vain with Amnon, Tamar said, &quot; Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee &quot;. This would imply that - in spite of the prohibition set out elsewhere in the Bible - the marriage of siblings (at least those of different mothers, as Amnon and Tamar were) could be acceptable in the society in which the story was written.
