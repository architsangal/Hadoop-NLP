{ Edward T. Hall &apos;s personal &apos;&apos;&apos;reaction bubbles&apos;&apos;&apos; (1966), showing } { radius in feet } Proxemics is a subcategory of the study of nonverbal communication along with haptics (touch), kinesics (body movement), vocalics (paralanguage), and chronemics (structure of time). [ Moore Nina Nonverbal Communication:Studies and Applications 2010 Oxford University Press New York ] Proxemics can be defined as &quot; the interrelated observations and theories of man’s use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture”. [ Hall Edward T. The Hidden Dimension 1966 Anchor Books 0-385-08476-5 ] Edward T. Hall, the cultural anthropologist who coined the term in 1963, emphasized the impact of proxemic behavior (the use of space) on interpersonal communication. Hall believed that the value in studying proxemics comes from its applicability in evaluating not only the way man interacts with others in his daily life, but also &quot; the organization of space in his houses and buildings, and ultimately the layout of his towns. [ Hall Edward T. A System for the Notation of Proxemic Behavior American Anthropologist 1963 October 65 5 1003–1026 29 February 2012 ] In animals, Swiss zoologist Heini Hediger had distinguished between flight distance (run boundary), critical distance (attack boundary), personal distance (distance separating members of non-contact species, as a pair of swans), and social distance (intraspecies communication distance). Hall reasoned that, with very few exceptions, flight distance and critical distance have been eliminated in human reactions, and thus interviewed hundreds of people to determine modified criteria for human interactions. In his work on proxemics, Edward T. Hall separated his theory into two overarching categories: personal space and territory. Personal space describes the immediate space surrounding a person, while territory refers to the area which a person may &quot; lay claim to &quot; and defend against others. His theory on territoriality has been applied to animal behaviors as well; defending territory is said to be a means of &quot; propagation of the species by regulating density &quot;. [ Personal Space ] Body spacing and posture, according to Hall, are unintentional reactions to sensory fluctuations or shifts, such as subtle changes in the sound and pitch of a person&apos;s voice. Social distance between people is reliably correlated with physical distance, as are intimate and personal distance, according to the delineations below. Hall did not mean for these measurements to be strict guidelines that translate precisely to human behavior, but rather a system for gauging the effect of distance on communication and how the effect varies between cultures and other environmental factors. [ 6 in cm ] [ 6 to 18 in cm ] Close phase – less than Far phase – { Personal distance for interactions among good } { friends or } { family members } [ 1.5 to 2.5 ft cm ] [ 2.5 to 4 ft cm ] Close phase – Far phase – { Social distance for interactions among acquaintances } [ 4 to 7 ft m ] [ 7 to 12 ft m ] Close phase – Far phase – { Public distance used for public speaking } [ 12 to 25 ft m ] [ 25 ft m ] Close phase – Far phase – or more. In addition to physical distance, the level of intimacy between conversants can be determined by &quot; socio-petal socio-fugal axis &quot;, or the &quot; angle formed by the axis of the conversants&apos; shoulders &quot;. Hall has also studied combinations of postures between dyads (two people) including lying prone, sitting, or standing. These variations in positioning are impacted by a variety of nonverbal communicative factors, listed below. kinesthetic factors This category deals with how closely the participants are to touching, from being completely outside of body-contact distance to being in physical contact, which parts of the body are in contact, and body part positioning. touching code This behavioural category concerns how participants are touching one another, such as caressing, holding, feeling, prolonged holding, spot touching, pressing against, accidental brushing, or not touching at all. visual code This category denotes the amount of eye contact between participants. Four sub-categories are defined, ranging from eye-to-eye contact to no eye contact at all. thermal code This category denotes the amount of body heat that each participant perceives from another. Four sub-categories are defined: conducted heat detected, radiant heat detected, heat probably detected, and no detection of heat. olfactory code This category deals in the kind and degree of odour detected by each participant from the other. voice loudness This category deals in the vocal effort used in speech. Seven sub-categories are defined: silent, very soft, soft, normal, normal+, loud, and very loud. [ Cultural Factors ] Hall notes that different cultures maintain different standards of personal space. The Lewis Model of Cultural Types indicates the variations in personal interactive qualities, indicating three poles: &quot; linear-active &quot; cultures, which are characterized as cool and decisive (Germany, Norway, USA), &quot; reactive &quot; cultures, characterized as accommodating and non-confrontational (Vietnam, China, Japan), and &quot; multi-active &quot; cultures, characterized as warm and impulsive (Brazil, Mexico, Italy). [ Lewis Richard Cross-Culture http://www.crossculture.com/services/cross-culture/ 27 March 2012 ] Realizing and recognizing these cultural differences improves cross-cultural understanding, and helps eliminate discomfort people may feel if the interpersonal distance is too large ( &quot; stand-offish &quot; ) or too small (intrusive). [ Territory ] There are four forms of human territory in proxemic theory. They are: public territory a place where one may freely enter interactional territory a place where people congregate informally home territory a place where people claim their individual territory body territory the space immediately surrounding us These different levels of territory, in addition to factors involving personal space, suggest ways for us to communicate and produce expectations of appropriate behavior. [ Lyman S.M. Scott, M.B. Territoriality: A Neglected Sociological Dimension Social Problems 1967 15 236–249 27 March 2012 ] [ Proxemics in Applied Research ] Much research in the fields of Communication, Psychology, and Sociology, especially under the category of Organizational Behavior, has shown that physical proximity enhances peoples&apos; ability to work together. Face-to-face interaction is often used as a tool to maintain the culture, authority, and norms of an organization or workplace. [ Levitt B J.G. March Organizational Learning Annual Review of Sociology 1988 14 319–340 ] [ Nelson R. R. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change 1982 Belknap Press Cambridge, MA ] An extensive body of research has been written about how proximity is affected by the use of new communication technologies. The importance of physical proximity in co-workers is often emphasized. In developing new communication technologies, the theory of proxemics is often considered. While physical proximity cannot be achieved when people are connected virtually, perceived proximity can be attempted, and several studies have shown that it is a crucial indicator in the effectiveness of virtual communication technologies. [ O&apos;Leary Michael Boyer Wilson, Jeanne M; Metiu, Anca; Jett, Quintus R Perceived Proximity in Virtual Work: Explaining the Paradox of Far-but-Close Organization Studies 2008 29 7 979–1002 ] [ Monge Peter R Kirste, Kenneth K Measuring Proximity in Human Organization Social Psychology Quarterly 1980 43 1 110–115 ] [ Monge Peter R Rothman, Lynda White; Eisenberg, Eric M; Miller, Katherine I; Kirste, Kenneth K The Dynamics of Organizational Proximity Management Science 1985 31 9 1129–1141 ] [ Olson Gary M Olson, Judith S Distance Matters Human Computer Interaction 2000 15 139–178 ] These studies suggest that various individual and situational factors influence how close we feel to another person, regardless of distance. The mere-exposure effect originally referred to the tendency of a person to positively favor those who they have been physically exposed to most often. [ Zajonc R.B. Attitudinal Effect of Mere Exposure Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 1968 9 2–17 ] However, recent research has extended this effect to virtual communication. This work suggests that the more someone communicates virtually with another person, the more he is able to envision that person&apos;s appearance and workspace, therefore fostering a sense of personal connection. Increased communication has also been seen to foster common ground, or the feeling of identification with another, which leads to positive attributions about that person. Some studies emphasize the importance of shared physical territory in achieving common ground, [ Hinds Pamela Distributed Work 2002 MIT Press Cambridge, MA Kiesler, Sara ] while others find that common ground can be achieved virtually, by communicating often.
