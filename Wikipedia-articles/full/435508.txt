Joining the professional sport in Japan in 1988, he was trained by pioneering Hawaiian sumo wrestler Takamiyama and rose swiftly up the rankings, reaching the top division in 1990. After two consecutive yusho or tournament championships in November 1992 and January 1993 he made history by becoming the first foreign born wrestler ever to reach yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo. One of the tallest and heaviest wrestlers ever, Akebono&apos;s rivalry with the young Japanese hopefuls, Takanohana and Wakanohana, was a big factor in the increased popularity of sumo at tournament venues and on TV in the early 1990s. [ Akebono Lewis Ferd http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/150/sesq5akebono Honolulu Advertiser 2006-07-02 2007-05-25 ] During his eight years at the yokozuna rank, Akebono won a further eight tournament championships, for a career total of eleven, and was a runner-up on thirteen other occasions, despite suffering several serious injury problems. Although his rival yokozuna Takanohana won more tournaments in this period, their individual head-to-heads remained very close. Akebono became a Japanese citizen in 1996, and after retiring in 2001 he worked as a coach at Azumazeki stable before leaving the Sumo Association in 2003. After an unsuccessful period as a K-1 fighter, he is now a freelance professional wrestler, mainly performing for the All Japan Pro Wrestling promotion. He is the current Zero1 World Heavyweight Champion in Zero1. [ Early life ] Rowan was born on May 8, 1969 to Randolph and Janice Rowan. [ Ardolino Frank Dawn P Dawson Great Athletes Revised 1 2002 1992 Salem Press 1-58765-008-8 23–25 ] He grew up with two younger brothers, one of whom, Ola, also became a sumo wrestler for a brief period after Chad. He attended Kaiser High School, where he played basketball and became an All-Star center. He went to Hawaii Pacific University on a basketball scholarship, but sat out his freshman season. [ Early career ] Rowan was planning to study for a career in hotel management, [ Sharnoff, Lora Grand Sumo Weatherhill 1993 0-8348-0283-X ] but he had always been interested in sumo from watching television broadcasts, and a family friend introduced him to Azumazeki Oyakata, the former Takamiyama, who also originally hailed from Hawai i. Azumazeki overcame his initial concerns that Rowan might be too tall and his legs too long for sumo, and agreed to let him join his Azumazeki stable, founded in 1986. Rowan flew to Japan in early 1988. Adopting the shikona of Akebono, meaning &quot; new dawn &quot; in Japanese, [ Hall Mina The Big Book of Sumo Paperback 2007-06-03 Stone Bridge Press 1997 Berkeley, CA, USA 1-880656-28-0 89 ] he made his professional debut in March 1988. [ Akebono Japan Sumo Association http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_meikan/rikishi_joho/rikishi.php?A%3D35 2007-06-02 ] This entry cohort was one of the most successful ever, producing two other yokozuna, Takanohana and Wakanohana (sons of the popular champion from the 1970s, Takanohana Kenshi ), as well as a great ozeki, Kaio. [ Kaio Japan Sumo Association http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_meikan/rikishi_joho/rikishi_6.html 2007-06-02 ] Akebono rose rapidly through the ranks, equaling the record for the most consecutive kachikoshi (majority of wins in a sumo championship) from debut, reaching sekiwake before suffering his first makekoshi losing record. He was promoted to jūryō in March 1990, the first sekitori from his stable, and to makuuchi in September of the same year. [ Akebono Taro Rikishi Information Sumo Reference http://sumodb.sumogames.com/Rikishi.aspx?r%3D1 20 April 2009 ] He made his top division debut in the same tournament as Wakanohana, as well as Takatoriki and Daishoyama. In the November 1990 tournament he was awarded his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit, and in January 1991 he earned his first gold star for defeating yokozuna Asahifuji. In March 1991 he defeated ozeki Konishiki in the first ever match between two non-Japanese wrestlers in the top division. [ Promotion ] In 1992, after a year of 8-7 or 7-8 records near the top of the makuuchi division, Akebono suddenly came alive with a 13-2 record in January of that year, narrowly losing the top division championship to Takanohana. [ Rikishi In Makunouchi and Juryo szumo.hu http://www.szumo.hu/sekitori/Akebono.html 2007-06-02 ] A second 13-2 record two tournaments later, in May, saw him win the top division championship for the first time, and with it promotion to ozeki. After an injury during the summer, he went on to win consecutive championships in November 1992 and January 1993 to win promotion to Yokozuna. At the time of his promotion, the rank of yokozuna had been vacant for 8 months (an exceedingly rare occurrence) and his promotion, despite the fact that he was the first foreign yokozuna, was welcomed by many. He had met the stipulation of winning two consecutive tournaments that had been mentioned by the Yokozuna Deliberation Council when turning down Konishiki the previous year, and was also seen as having conducted himself with the dignity and humility necessary for such an exalted rank. [ Pollack,Andrew Sumo Bows and Opens Sacred Door to U.S. Star New York Times http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9F0CEEDE1338F935A15752C0A965958260%26amp%3Bsec%3D%26amp%3Bspon%3D%26amp%3Bpagewanted%3Dall 1993-01-26 2008-04-17 ] One commentator remarked, &quot; He makes me forget he is a foreigner because of his earnest attitude towards sumo. &quot; [ Yokozuna era ] Akebono was a long standing and strong Yokozuna, lasting nearly eight years in the rank and winning the top division championship on a further eight occasions. His career highlights include the rare achievement of winning the top division championship in three consecutive tournaments, in 1993. In July 1993 he beat Takanohana and Wakanohana in consecutive matches to win the honbasho when all three ended up tied at the end of the 15 day tournament, and in May 1997 he defeated Takanohana twice on the final day, once in their regular match and once in a playoff, to win his first title in over two years. The competition between Akebono and Takanohana, who reached yokozuna himself in 1995, was said to be one of the great defining rivalries of postwar sumo. { http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20070530TDY24001.htm } The two finished their careers with a 20-20 tie in bouts against one another. [ Lewin, Brian What will become of the dynasty? Sumo Fan Magazine http://www.sumofanmag.com/content/Issue_2/Hanada4.htm August 2005 2008-06-05 ] At the opening ceremony of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, a professional sumo wrestler was chosen to represent each of the competing countries and lead them into the stadium. After Takanohana fell ill, Akebono was given the honor of representing Japan in the opening ceremony. [ Winter Olympics: Akebono to lead sumo&apos;s debut on Olympic stage The London Independent http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980129/ai_n9651719 1998-01-29 2007-06-02 http://web.archive.org/web/20071228212101/http%3A//findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980129/ai_n9651719 2007-12-28 ] Akebono also led other sumo wrestlers in a ring cleansing ceremony at the Opening Ceremony (also meant to cleanse the stadium itself). Akebono was quite susceptible to injury because of his height and weight. [ Sumo great Akebono retires BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1130668.stm 2001-01-22 2007-06-02 ] He suffered his first serious knee injury in May 1994 when, after winning his first ten matches, he lost a bout to Takatoriki and fell awkwardly. He flew to Los Angeles and underwent career-saving surgery. [ Panek, Mark Gaijin Yokozuna University of Hawaii Press 2006 0-8248-3043-1 ] From November 1998 to March 1999 he missed three successive tournaments due to a herniated disc in his lower back and faced calls for his retirement. However, after receiving the personal backing of the Chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, he scored a respectable 11-4 record in his comeback tournament in May 1999. In 2000 he enjoyed his first completely injury-free year since 1993 and won two tournaments, finishing as runner-up in three others. He won 76 bouts out of a possible 90, the best record of any wrestler that year. [ Fighting style ] Akebono was one of the tallest sumo wrestlers ever, at 203  cm (6  ft 8 in) tall, and also one of the heaviest with a fighting weight around 235  kg (517  lb). Despite having long legs, considered a disadvantage in sumo as it tends to make one top heavy and susceptible to throws, he covered for this by training exceptionally hard, and using his long reach to thrust his opponents out of the dohyo (ring). In his prime, he had incredible thrusting strength and on many occasions would blast lesser wrestlers out of the ring in one or two strokes using tsuppari techniques. His most common winning kimarite was oshi-dashi, a simple push out, and he also regularly won by tsuki-dashi, the thrust out. In later years he also used his reach to more often grab his opponent&apos;s mawashi, or belt, and then use his weight and power to force the opponent from the ring by yori-kiri. He liked a migi-yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside grip, and was fond of using his left hand to employ uwatenage, or overarm throw.

After his retirement, he became a member (or elder) of the Japan Sumo Association as a coach, or oyakata, and worked with his former mentor in the Azumazeki stable. He helped train the Mongolia n wrestler Asashoryu who also became a yokozuna, and Akebono instructed him on how to perform the dohyo-iri, or yokozuna ring-entering ceremony. While an oyakata, Akebono also appeared in TV commercials and opened a restaurant called ZUNA.

His koenkai, or supporters network, had dissolved after his marriage in 1998, depriving him of a valuable source of income. In addition, he earned far less as an oyakata than he had as a yokozuna. K-1 offered him a chance to clear his debts by fighting for them.
