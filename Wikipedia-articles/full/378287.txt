It was built to replace the Lahug Airport, which could no longer be expanded due to safety and physical problems. The airport was then expanded in its later years to become the current Mactan-Cebu International Airport (MCIA). The airport is currently the second busiest in the country after Manila&apos;s Ninoy Aquino International Airport and serves as the country&apos;s primary alternative gateway. The airport is currently in the process of building an administrative building. The construction is currently stalled due to irregularities in the deal but it is expected to continue soon. The idea behind the building is to free up space in the airport terminal so that the airport can expand passenger facilities without necessarily expanding the size of the airport. Currently, all airport offices are located inside the Main Terminal. A VIP Lounge for the ASEAN Summit held in Cebu in 2007. The airport lounge now serves as the primary welcome area for VIPs visiting Cebu.

The airliner was able to make an emergency landing.Authorities later found out that Ramzi Yousef planted the bomb on the airliner to test the bomb for his Project Bojinka plot. His project was discovered in Manila after an apartment fire on the night of January 5 and the morning of January 6, 1995. Ramzi Yousef was on board Flight 434 from Manila when he planted the bomb beneath a vacant seat. He used a fake identity thus he was able to pass through security in Manila. Yousef set the time for the bomb to blow off when the airplane was already in its Cebu-Tokyo leg. Yousef got off the plane during the stopover in Cebu from Manila.
