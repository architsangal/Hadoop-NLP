[ the Egyptian food Dukka ] [ 100% dukkha dukkha ( Dev : दुक्ख) duḥkha ( Dev : दुःख) suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction, discontentment, etc. སྡུག་བསྔལ། Wylie : sdug bsngal; THL : dukngal 苦 kǔ 苦 ku 苦 (ko) khổ ဒုက္ခ doʊʔkʰa̰ ] Dukkha (Pāli; Sanskrit: [ duḥkha ]; Tibetan phonetic: dukngal) is a Buddhist term commonly translated as &quot; suffering &quot;, &quot; stress &quot;, &quot; anxiety &quot;, or &quot; dissatisfaction &quot;. Dukkha is identified as the first of the Four Noble Truths. Within the Buddhist tradition, dukkha is commonly explained according to three different patterns or categories. In the first category, dukkha includes the obvious physical suffering or pain associated with giving birth, growing old, physical illness and the process of dying. These outer discomforts are referred to as the dukkha of ordinary suffering (dukkha-dukkha). In a second category, dukkha also includes the anxiety or stress of trying to hold onto things that are constantly changing; these inner anxieties are called the dukkha produced by change (vipariṇāma-dukkha). The third pattern or category of dukkha refers to a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all forms of life, due to the fact that all forms of life are impermanent and constantly changing. On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards. This subtle dissatisfaction is referred to as the dukkha of conditioned states (saṃkhāra-dukkha). [ Neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but realistic ] The central importance of dukkha in Buddhist philosophy is not intended to present a pessimistic view of life, but rather to present a realistic practical assessment of the human condition—that all beings must experience suffering and pain at some point in their lives, including the inevitable sufferings of illness, aging, and death. [ Gethin 1998 61 ] Contemporary Buddhist teachers and translators emphasize that while the central message of Buddhism is optimistic, the Buddhist view of our situation in life (the conditions that we live in) is neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but realistic. [ Goldstein 2002 150 ] { * Rupert Gethin states: &quot; On the basis of its analysis of the problem of suffering, some have concluded that Buddhism must be judged a bleak, pessimistic and world-denying philosophy. From a Buddhist perspective, such a judgement may reflect a deep-seated refusal to accept the reality of duḥkha itself, and it certainly reflects a particular misunderstanding of the Buddha’s teaching. The Buddha taught four truths and, by his own standards, the cessation of suffering and the path leading to its cessation are as much true realities as suffering and its cause. The growth of early Buddhism must be understood in the context of the existence of a number of different ‘renouncer’ groups who shared the view that ‘suffering’ in some sense characterizes human experience, and that the quest for happiness is thus only to be fulfilled by fleeing the world. &quot; } [ Gethin 1998 62 ] { * Ajahn Sucitto states: &quot; As the Buddha points out in his many discourses, things change, and change can be effected without the naïveté that assumes that solutions are going to be permanently satisfactory and without the pessimism that assumes that it’s all hopeless. The Buddha taught dukkha, but also the cessation of dukkha. The particulars of unpleasant circumstances can come to an end or be brought to an end, even if problems then surface in other areas. And the way of meeting conflict and problems can be compassionate, calm, and peaceful in itself. So accepting that life has its dark, problematic side needn’t be depressing. Most fruitfully, the kind of suffering that is the mental reaction to a situation, even on an instinctive plane, can be completely abolished. With the ending of that kind of suffering, the mind is clearer and wiser and more capable of effecting positive change in the world of ever-changing circumstances. &quot; } [ Ajahn Sucitto 2010 36 ] { * Ringu Tulku states: &quot; It is sometimes said that Buddhism is a very pessimistic religion, since it constantly talks about suffering. But Buddhism does not aim at creating suffering or a pessimistic attitude. It talks about suffering in order to engender an optimistic outlook. It conveys the message, &quot; Yes there is suffering, but it can be removed. &quot; In order to do so, we have to open our eyes. If we pretend that everything is all right, it will not be of much avail, especially when a problem arises that is so great that it can not be denied. &quot; } [ Ringu Tulku 2005 23 ] { * } { Traleg Kyabgon states: &quot; Normally we think our happiness is contingent upon external circumstances and situations, rather than upon our own inner atti­tude toward things, or toward life in general. The Buddha was saying that dissatisfaction is part of life, even if we are seeking happiness and even if we manage to find temporary happiness. The very fact that it is temporary means that sooner or later the happiness is going to pass. So the Buddha said that unless we understand this and see how pervasive dissatisfaction or duhkha is, it is impossible for us to start looking for real happiness. &quot; } Walpola Rahula explains the importance of this realistic point of view: [ Walpola Rahula 2007 loc. 525-541 ] Surya Das emphasizes the matter-of-fact nature of dukkha: [ Lama Surya Das 1997 loc.1300 ] The Buddha acknowledged that there is both happiness and sorrow in the world, but he taught that even when we have some kind of happiness, it is not permanent; it is subject to change. And due to this unstable, impermanent nature of all things, everything we experience is said to have the quality of duh­kha or unsatisfactoriness. Therefore unless we can gain insight into that truth, and understand what is really able to provide lasting happiness, and what is unable to provide happiness, the experience of dissatisfac­tion will persist. [ Thich Nhat Hanh 1999 11 ] { &apos;&apos;The Four Noble Truths&apos;&apos; by Traleg Kyabgon } [ Three patterns of dukkha ] Within the Buddhist tradition, dukkha is commonly explained according to three different patterns or levels or categories: [ Walpola Rahula 2007 loc. 590-592 ] [ Gethin 1998 61 ] [ Walpola Rahula 2007 loc. 590-592 ] [ Chogyam Trungpa 2009 26-28 ] [ Sakyong Mipham 2003 159-160 ] [ Ringu Tulku 2005 24 ] [ Lama Surya Das 1997 78-80 ] { &apos;&apos;Suffering in Depth&apos;&apos; by Bhikkhu Bodhi } { &apos;&apos;The Three Kinds of Suffering&apos;&apos; by Toni Bernhard } { &apos;&apos;Dukkha Sutta: Stress&apos;&apos; translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu } { &apos;&apos;Embracing Imperfection&apos;&apos; by Ines Freedman } Dukkha of ordinary suffering Pali: dukkha-dukkha Also referred to as the suffering of suffering. Includes the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, death, and coming across what is not desirable. This outer level of dukkha includes all of the obvious physical suffering or pain associated with giving birth, growing old, physical illness and the process of dying. Dukkha produced by change Pali: viparinama-dukkha Also referred to as: suffering of change or suffering of impermanence. Includes two categories: trying to hold onto what is desirable, and not getting what you want. Buddhist author Chogyam Trungpa includes the category &quot; not knowing what you want. &quot; Pema Chodron described this type of suffering as the suffering of trying to hold onto things that are always changing This inner level of dukkha includes the anxiety or stress of trying to hold onto things that are constantly changing. Dukkha of conditioned states Pali sankhara -dukkha Also referred to as all-pervasive suffering This category is also identified as one of the &quot; eight types of suffering &quot;. Pema Chodron describes this as the suffering of ego-clinging; the suffering of struggling with life as it is, as it presents itself to you; struggling against outer situations and yourself, your own emotions and thoughts, rather then just opening and allowing. This is a subtle form of suffering arising as a reaction to qualities of conditioned things, including the skandha s, the factors constituting the human mind. This is the deepest, most subtle level of dukkha; it includes &quot; a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence, all forms of life, due to the fact that all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance. &quot; &apos;&apos;The Four Noble Truths - By Bhikkhu Bodhi On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards. [ Eight types of dukkha ] The three patterns of dukkha described above can also be broken down into eight types: [ Chogyam Trungpa 2009 16-26 ] { &apos;&apos;The First Noble Truth - Dukkha&apos;&apos; by Bhikkhu Bodhi } Suffering of birth: the discomfort of birth and experiencing the world for the first time; and the discomfort of relating to new demands or experiences. Suffering of old age: the discomfort involved in the process of aging and growing old; this can apply to psychological as well as physical discomfort of aging. Suffering of sickness: the discomfort of physical or psychological illness. Suffering of death: includes the pain of separation and not being able to continue on in your endeavors, as well as the physical discomfort of dying. Suffering of getting what you don&apos;t want: being unable to avoid difficult or painful situations. Suffering of not getting what you do want: this includes the pain of trying to hold onto what is desirable. All-pervasive suffering: a very subtle dissatisfaction that exists all the time; it arises as a reaction to the qualities of conditioned things (e.g. the impermanence of things). [ Three marks of existence ] [ Three marks of existence ] Dukkha is also listed among the three marks of existence. These are: Impermanence ( anicca ) Suffering (dukkha) Not-self ( anatta ). In this context, dukkha denotes the experience that all formations ( sankhara ) are impermanent ( anicca ) - thus it explains the qualities which make the mind as fluctuating and impermanent entities. It is therefore also a gateway to anatta, not-self. [ Developing insight into dukkha ] The Buddhist teachings emphasize the importance of practicing meditation in order to develop insight into dukkha. Contemporary Buddhist teacher Ajahn Brahm emphasizes this point using a simile that compares the experience of dukkha to being in prison, and compares meditation (Pali: jhana) to a tunnel that leads out of the prison: [ lower-alpha This simile is comparable to Plato&apos;s Allegory of the Cave ] [ Ajahn Brahm 2006 ] Contemporary Buddhist teacher Chogyam Trungpa explains that meditation is designed to develop an understanding of dukkha: [ Chogyam Trungpa 2009 34 ] Similarly, the Anapanasati Sutta and Maha-satipatthana Sutta indicate that a person first needs to practice meditation to purify the mind of the five hindrances to wisdom before contemplating the Four Noble Truths, which begin with the nature of &quot; dukkha &quot; in life. The need to develop insight into dukkha is also emphasized in Samyutta Nikaya #35, in which the Buddha says: What ordinary folk call happiness, the enlightened ones call dukkha. Contemporary scholar Micheal Carrithers also emphasizes the need to examine one&apos;s life. Carrithers asserts that insofar as it is dynamic, ever-changing, uncontrollable and not finally satisfactory, unexamined life is itself precisely dukkha. [ Carrithers 1986 op cit., pp. 55-56. ] Carrithers also asserts that the question which underlay the Buddha&apos;s quest was &quot; in what may I place lasting relevance? &quot; He did not deny that there are satisfactions in experience: the exercise of vipassana assumes that the meditator sees instances of happiness clearly. Pain is to be seen as pain, and pleasure as pleasure. It is denied that happiness dependent on conditions will be secure and lasting. [ Carrithers 1986 op cit., pp. 55-56. ] [ Relation to the five skandhas ] According to the Buddhist tradition, the dukkha of conditioned states (saṃkhāra-dukkha) is related to clinging to the skandhas. Oxford scholar Noa Ronkin discusses the relation between the skandhas (Sanskrit; Pali: khandhas) and dukkha: [ Ronkin 2005 43 ] [ Within Buddhist literature ] Dukkha appears frequently in Buddhist texts. Jeffrey Po explains: Dukkha is an extremely important concept and is central to understanding Buddhism in its entirety. It appears in the first of the Four Noble Truths and as one of the Three Characteristics of Existence. References to &quot; dukkha &quot; as one of life&apos;s situations abound in many of the suttas delivered by Lord Buddha Himself as well as in numerous Buddhist philosophical and psychological thoughts. The Four Noble Truths deal with the nature of &quot; dukkha &quot; in life, what is the cause of &quot; dukkha &quot;, the cessation (cure) for &quot; dukkha &quot;, and the techniques to bring about the cessation of &quot; dukkha &quot;. The first noble truth is presented within the Buddha&apos;s first discourse, Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dharma ( Dharmacakra Pravartana Sūtra ), as follows: { Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu } [ Bhikkhu Bodhi (translator) 2000 1844 ] &quot; This is the noble truth of dukkha: birth is dukkha, aging is dukkha, illness is dukkha, death is dukkha; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair are dukkha; union with what is displeasing is dukkha; separation from what is pleasing is dukkha; not to get what one wants is dukkha; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are dukkha. &quot; Texts like the Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta { MN 63, trans. } { Thanissaro Bhikkhu, retrieved from &quot; Access to Insight &quot; at http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html } and Anuradha Sutta, { SN 22.86, trans., Thanissaro Bhikkhu, retrieved from &quot; Access to Insight &quot; at http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.086.than.html } show Buddha as insisting that the truths about dukkha and the way to end dukkha are the only ones he is teaching as far as attaining the ultimate goal of nirvana is concerned. [ Within non-Buddhist literature ] [ Hinduism ] In Hindu literature, the earliest Upani ṣ ads — the Bṛhadāraṇyaka and the Chāndogya — are believed to predate or coincide with the advent of Buddhism. { See, e.g., Patrick Olivelle (1996), Upani } [ ṣ ] { ads (Oxford: Oxford University Press), ISBN 978-0-19-283576-5, p. xxxvi: &quot; The scholarly consensus, well-founded I think, is that the } { Bṛhadāraṇyaka and the } [ Chāndogya ] { are the two earliest } { Upani ṣ ads.... The two texts as we have them are, in all likelihood, pre-Buddhist; placing them in the seventh to sixth centuries BCE may be reasonable, give or take a century or so. &quot; } In these texts&apos; verses, the Sanskrit word du [ ḥ ] kha (translated below as &quot; suffering &quot; and &quot; distress &quot; ) occurs only twice. In the [ Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad ], it states (in English and Sanskrit): [ ihaiva santo &apos;tha vidmas tad vayaṃ na ced avedir mahatī vinaṣṭiḥ ye tad vidur amṛtās te bhavanty athetare duḥkham evāpiyanti ] English Sanskrit While we are still here, we have come to know it [ &apos;&apos; ā tman&apos;&apos; ]. If you&apos;ve not known it, great is your destruction. Those who have known it — they become immortal. As for the rest — only suffering awaits them. BU 4.4.14, trans. Olivelle (1996), p. 66.

In the [ Chāndogya Upaniṣad ] is written: [ na paśyo mṛtyuṃ paśyati na rogaṃ nota duḥkhatām sarvaṃ ha paśyaḥ paśyati sarvam āpnoti sarvaśaḥ ] English Sanskrit When a man rightly sees, he sees no death, no sickness or distress. When a man rightly sees, he sees all, he wins all, completely. CU 7.26.2, trans. Olivelle (1996), p. 166. Compare this statement to that in the Pali Canon&apos;s Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta ( SN 56.11) where sickness and death are formulaically identified as examplars of dukkha. ChUp 7,26.2. Retrieved 27 December 2008 from &quot; Georg-August-Universität Göttingen &quot; at http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/4_upa/chup___u.htm. Thus, as in Buddhism, these texts emphasize the eradication of du [ ḥ ] kha as a desired and promised outcome; here du [ ḥ ] kha serves as an antipode to the ultimate Brahmanic goal of immortality ( [ amṛtās ] ). In addition, as in Buddhism, one overcomes du [ ḥ ] kha through the development of a transcendent understanding. { For a general discussion of the core Indian spiritual goal of developing transcendent &quot; seeing, &quot; see, e.g., Hamilton, Sue (2000/2001), Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction, (Oxford: Oxford U. Press), pp. 9-10, ISBN 978-0-19-285374-5. } Nonetheless, in these Brahmanic sacred texts, du [ ḥ ] kha is either identified as a general condition or as simply one of many undesirable states, not embodying the conceptual centrality assigned to it in Buddhist thought. [ Panetics ] [ Ralph Siu Suffering#Social_sciences ] In 1986, the Journal of Humanistic Psychology published an article by Ralph G.H. Siu entitled Panetics—The Study of the Infliction of Suffering. { Journal of Humanistic Psychology, Vol. 28, No. 3, 6-22 (1988). } In the abstract for the article, Sui proposed using the term dukkha as a quantitative measurement; he wrote: After analyzing the unceasing mutual inflictions of suffering by practically everyone and the neglect of this pervasive and degenerating human deficiency by the academic community, I urge the immediate creation of a new and vigorous academic discipline, called panetics, to be devoted to the study of the infliction of suffering. The nature, scope, illustrative contents, and social value are outlined. The dukkha is proposed as a semiquantitative unit of suffering to assist in associated analytical operations. Related publications include: Vol. I, Less Suffering for Everybody. Ibid. Vol. II, Panetics and Dukkhas. Ibid. Vol. III, Seeds of Reflection, Panetic Word Clusters. Ibid [ Etymology ] The early Western translators of Buddhist texts (prior to the 1970s) translated the Pali term dukkha as &quot; suffering &quot; and conveyed the impression that Buddhism was a pessimistic or world-denying philosophy. Later translators, however, including Walpola Rahula (What Buddha Taught, 1974) and nearly all contemporary translators, have emphasized that &quot; suffering &quot; is too limited a translation for the term dukkha, and have preferred to either leave the term untranslated or to clarify that translation with terms such as unease, anxiety, stress, dissatisfaction, disquietude, etc. [ Walpola Rahula 2007 loc. 525-541 ] [ Prebish 1993 ] [ Keown 2003 ] { &apos;&apos;Is Buddhism a Pessimistic Way of Life?&apos;&apos; by Jeffrey Po } Rupert Gethin explains: [ Gethin 1998 61 ] Rich in meaning and nuance, the word duḥkha is one of the basic terms of Buddhist and other Indian religious discourse. Literally ‘pain’ or ‘anguish’, in its religious and philosophical contexts duḥkha is, however, suggestive of an underlying sense of ‘unsatisfactoriness’ or ‘unease’ that must ultimately mar even our experience of happiness. On the deepest level, dukkha suggests a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all forms of life, due to the fact that all forms of life are impermanent and constantly changing. Dukkha indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards. [ Walpola Rahula 2007 loc. 514-524 ] Sargeant (2009: p.  303) explains the historical roots of duḥkha and its antonym sukha: [ Sargeant 2009 303 ] It is perhaps amusing to note the etymology of the words sukha (pleasure, comfort, bliss) and duḥkha (misery, unhappiness, pain). The ancient Aryans who brought the Sanskrit language to India were a nomadic, horse- and cattle-breeding people who travelled in horse- or ox-drawn vehicles. Su and dus are prefixes indicating good or bad. The word kha, in later Sanskrit meaning &quot; sky, &quot; &quot; ether, &quot; or &quot; space, &quot; was originally the word for &quot; hole, &quot; particularly an axle hole of one of the Aryan&apos;s vehicles. Thus sukha … meant, originally, &quot; having a good axle hole, &quot; while duhkha meant &quot; having a poor axle hole, &quot; leading to discomfort. According to grammatical tradition, dukkha is derived from [ dus-kha ] &quot; uneasy &quot;, but according to Monier-Williams more likely a Prakrit ized form of [ dus-stha ] &quot; unsteady, disquieted &quot;. [ Monier-Williams 1899, 1964 483 ] The Sanskrit prefix &apos;su&apos; is used as an emphasis suggesting wholesome, high, evolved, desirable, strong and such. { Bhaktivedanta VedaBase Network } Dukkha was translated as kǔ ( 苦 &quot; bitterness; hardship; suffering; pain &quot; ) in Chinese Buddhism, and this loanword is pronounced ku (苦) in Japanese Buddhism and ko (苦) in Korean Buddhism, and khổ in Vietnamese Buddhism. The Tibetan (phonetic) is dukngal. In Shan, it is [ tuk˥kʰaː˥ ] and in Burmese, it is [ doʊʔkʰa̰ ]. [ Alternate translations ] Translations used for dukkha in the context of the four noble truths are: A basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence (Bhikkhu Bodhi) Anguish Anxiety (Chogyam Trungpa: The Truth of Suffering, pp. 8-10) Affliction (Brazier) Dissatisfaction (Pema Chodron, Chogyam Trunpa) Discomfort Discontent Frustration Misery Sorrow Stress (Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Jon Kabat-Zin) Suffering (Thich Nhat Hanh, Ajahn Succito, Chogyam Trungpa, Rupert Gethin, et al.)
