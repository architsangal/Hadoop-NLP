[ Summers ] [ Residency ] Along with other spots on the Jersey Shore, Margate becomes a popular destination in the summer months. Many houses in Margate are second homes used during the Summer, and a considerable number are owned by year-round residents. Unlike in other places, such as Cape May or Ocean City, where many visitors spend a few nights in a hotel, Margate has no hotel, so most of the people who choose this town are regulars. Also unlike other area towns such as Ocean City and the municipalities on Long Beach Island, weekly house/condominium rentals are almost non-existent in Margate. However, perhaps due to the recent rise in gas prices and the slow pace of the real estate market, weekly rentals have increased over the past several years. More home and condo owners are happy to rent their property for a week or two. Most real estate offices in town can assist vacationers going &apos;down the shore&apos; in finding a weekly, monthly or summer rental. Winter rentals are also available. [ Recreation ] [ Beaches ] Margate beaches attract surfers, kayaking and hobie cat sailing. Some beaches provide restrooms for beachgoers.

Lifeguards are on duty during summer months from 10 am to 6 pm, with more limited hours in the late Spring and early Autumn months.
