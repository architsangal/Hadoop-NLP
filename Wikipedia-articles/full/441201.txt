[ May 2010 ] { French military pilot at 1,000 hours flight time } Hazing is various ritual s and other activities involving harassment, abuse or humiliation used as a way of initiating a person into a group. Hazing is seen in many different types of social group s, including in gang s, sports teams, school s, military unit s, workplace s and fraternities. In the United States and Canada, hazing is often associated with Greek-letter organizations (college fraternities and sororities ). Hazing is often prohibited by law and may comprise either physical (possibly violent ) or psychological abuse. It may also include nudity or sexually oriented activities. { definition, Merriam-Webster unabridged dictionary, 2010 } [ Terms ] In some continental Europe an languages, terms with a &quot; christening &quot; theme or etymology are preferred (e.g. baptême in French, in Dutch doop (mostly used in Flanders)) or variations on a theme of naïveté and the rite of passage such as a derivation from a term for freshman (e.g. bizutage in French, ontgroening (de-green[horn]ing) in Dutch (mostly used in the Netherlands), novatada in Spanish) or a combination of both, such as in the Finnish mopokaste (literally &quot; moped baptism &quot;, &quot; moped &quot; being the nickname for freshmen, stemming from the concept that they would be barred from riding a full motorcycle at their age). In Latvia n, the word &quot; iesvētības &quot;, which literally means &quot; in-blessings &quot; is used, it also stands for religious rites of passage, especially confirmation. In Swedish, the term used is &quot; nollning &quot;, literally &quot; zeroing &quot;. In Spain, the term is &quot; novatada &quot; from &quot; novato &quot; meaning newcomer and in Portugal &quot; praxe &quot;, which literally means &quot; habit &quot;. In the Italian military, instead, the term used was nonnismo, from nonno (literally &quot; grandfather &quot; ), a jargon term used for the soldiers who had already served for most of their draft period. A similar equivalent term exists in the Russian military, where a hazing phenomenon knowing as Dedovshchina exists, meaning roughly &quot; grandfather &quot; or the slang term &quot; gramps &quot; (referring to the senior corps of soldiers in their final year of conscription ). Often most or all of the endurance or the more serious ordeal is concentrated in an orgiastic collective session, which may be called hell night, or prolonged to a hell week and/or retreat or camp, sometimes again at the pledge&apos;s { &quot; Pledge &quot; is a common term for the initiation candidates; alternative terms include } { newbie, } { rookie, mainly in athletic teams, and } { freshman. } birthday (e.g. by birthday spanking ), but some traditions keep terrorizing pledges over a long period, resembling fagging. [ Initiation Rite of passage ] [ Scope ] { Universidad de Talca, } { Chile } [ Hazing in Greek letter organizations ] According to one of the largest US National Surveys regarding hazing including over 60,000 student athletes from 2,400 colleges and universities, coordinated by Dr Nadine C. Hoover of Alfred University, the August 30, 1999 &quot; National Survey: Initiation Rites and Athletics for NCAA Sports Teams &quot;; &quot; Over 325,000 athletes at more than 1,000 National Collegiate Athletic Association schools in the US participated in intercollegiate sports during 1998-99. Of these athletes: • More than a quarter of a million experienced some form of hazing to join a college athletic team. • One in five was subjected to unacceptable and potentially illegal hazing. They were kidnapped, beaten or tied up and abandoned. They were also forced to commit crimes – destroying property, making prank phone calls or harassing others. • Half were required to participate in drinking contests or alcohol-related hazing. • Two in five consumed alcohol on recruitment visits even before enrolling. • Two-thirds were subjected to humiliating hazing, such as being yelled or sworn at, forced to wearembarrassing clothing or forced to deprive themselves of sleep, food or personal hygiene. • One in five participated exclusively in positive initiations, such as team trips or ropes courses. &quot; Chapters of Greek letter organizations have developed complex hazing rituals that range from demeaning tasks to humiliating ceremonies. These practices are most common in, but not limited to, North American schools. Swedish students undergo a similar bonding period, known as nollningen, in which all members of the entering class participate (see fraternities and sororities for more information). College and universities in general, from Ivy league to smaller institutions, such as the officially sanctioned &quot; Kangaroo Court &quot; at Quincy University, Illinois have also been associated with hazing rituals [ January 2007 ]. Other groups within university life that have hazing rituals include competition teams, fan clubs, social groups, secret societies and even certain service club s, or rather their local chapters (such as some modern US Freemasons; not traditional masonic lodges). While hazing is less common in high schools, some secondary education institutions have developed hazing rituals. [ June 2011 ] The armed forces have long had hazing rituals, which often involve violence and punishments. The United States military defines hazing as unnecessarily exposing a fellow soldier to an act which is cruel, abusive, oppressive, or harmful. The Army maintains that they do not condone hazing, as it is not congruent with their value system. { Army Command Policy AR 600-20 April 27, 2010 } In the US hard hazing practices from World War I boot camps were introduced into colleges. [ June 2011 ] In Poland army hazing is called Polish fala &quot; wave &quot; adopted pre-World War I from non-Polish armies. [ June 2011 ] In the British Army it doesn&apos;t have a specific name as it isn&apos;t seen as a ritual of any sort, but similar incidents occur in the early ranks. [ June 2011 ] In the Russian army (formerly the Red Army ) hazing is called &quot; Dedovshchina &quot;. [ June 2011 ] Police forces, especially those with a paramilitary tradition, or sub-units of police forces such as tactical teams, may also have hazing rituals. [ June 2011 ] Rescue services, such as lifeguard s or air-sea rescue teams may have hazing rituals. [ June 2011 ] The senior ranks within Boy Scout Troops have sometimes developed hazing practices. [ June 2011 ] Some workplaces use hazing to initiate newly hired employees. [ June 2011 ] Inmate hazing is also common at prisons around the world, including frequent reports of beatings and sexual assaults by fellow inmates. [ June 2011 ] { Massachusetts Agricultural College. Circa 1879. } It is a subjective matter where to draw to line between &quot; normal &quot; hazing (somewhat abusive) and a rite of passage (essentially bonding; proponents may argue they can coincide), and there is a gray area where it passes over into sheer degrading, even harmful abuse that should not be tolerated even if accepted voluntarily (serious but avoidable accidents do still happen; deliberate abuse with similar grave medical consequences occurs, in some traditions rather often). [ June 2011 ] Furthermore, as it must be a ritual initiation, a different social context may mean a same treatment is technically hazing for some, not for others, e.g., a line-crossing ceremony when passing the equator at sea is hazing for the sailor while the extended (generally voluntary, more playful) application to passengers is not. [ June 2011 ] &quot; Hazing &quot; refers to any activity expected of someone joining a group (or to maintain full status in a group) that humiliates, degrades or risks emotional and/or physical harm, regardless of the person&apos;s willingness to participate. [ June 2011 ] In years past, hazing practices were typically considered harmless pranks or comical antics associated with young men in college fraternities. [ June 2011 ] Hazing extends far beyond college fraternities and is experienced by boys/men and girls/women in school groups, university organizations, athletic teams, the military, and other social and professional organizations. [ June 2011 ] Hazing is a complex social problem that is shaped by power dynamics operating in a group and/or organization and within a particular cultural context. [ June 2011 ] According to stophazing.org, hazing activities are generally considered to be physically abusive, hazardous, and/or sexually violating. The specific behaviors or activities within these categories vary widely among participants, groups and settings. While alcohol use is common in many types of hazing, other examples of typical hazing practices include personal servitude; sleep deprivation and restrictions on personal hygiene; yelling, swearing and insulting new members/rookies; being forced to wear embarrassing or humiliating attire in public; consumption of vile substances or smearing of such on one&apos;s skin; brandings; physical beatings; binge drinking and drinking games; sexual simulation and sexual assault. { Stophazing.org } [ Controversy ] [ section May 2007 ] { Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais against the violence in hazing ( &quot; trote &quot;, in Brazilian Portuguese) inside the colleges, in } { Belo Horizonte, } { Brazil. } The practice of ritual abuse among social groups is poorly understood. This is partly due to the secretive nature of the activities, especially within collegiate fraternities and sororities, and in part a result of long-term acceptance of hazing. Thus, it has been difficult for researchers to agree on the underlying social and psychological mechanisms that perpetuate hazing. In military circles hazing is sometimes assumed to test recruits under situations of stress and hostility. Although in no way a recreation of combat, hazing does put people into stressful situations that they are unable to control, which allegedly should weed out those weaker members prior to being put in situations where failure to perform will cost lives. A portion of the training course known as SERE (Survive, Evade, Resist, Escape) simulates as closely as is feasible the physical and psychological conditions of a POW camp. Part of the purpose of SERE training is to train and test soldiers on their ability to resist methods of interrogation. The problem with this approach, according to opponents, is that the stress and hostility comes from inside the group, from the assumed &quot; good guys &quot;, and not from outside as in actual combat situation, creating suspicion and distrust towards the superiors and comrades-in-arms. Willing participants may be motivated by a desire to prove to senior soldiers their stability in future combat situations, making the unit more secure, but blatantly brutal hazing can in fact produce negative results, making the units more prone to break, desert or mutiny than those without hazing traditions, as observed in the Russian army in Chechnya, where units with the strongest traditions of dedovschina were the first to break and desert under enemy fire. [ Sean Renaud A View from Chechnya: An Assessment of Russian Counterinsurgency During the two Chechen Wars and Future Implications 78 http://muir.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/1804/02_whole.pdf%3Bjsessionid%3DC9BC90145CBF36ED01677E1B5C4CF2FF?sequence%3D1 ] At worst, hazing may lead into fragging incidents. Outside of the criminal context, a form of the syndrome may take place in military basic training, in which &quot; training is a mildly traumatic experience intended to produce a bond, &quot; with the goal of forming military units which will remain loyal to each other even in life-threatening situations. It would be more difficult to make such a case in favour of hazing ceremonies in academic bodies and social clubs, where the origin is imitating educational (parental and school) discipline in substitute households and internal teaching. In a 1999 study, a survey of 3,293 collegiate athletes, coaches, athletic directors and deans found a variety of approaches to prevent hazing, including strong disciplinary and corrective measures for known cases, implementation of athletic, behavioral, and academic standards guiding recruitment; provisions for alternative bonding and recognition events for teams to prevent hazing; and law enforcement involvement in monitoring, investigating, and prosecuting hazing incidents. { Dr. Nadine C. Hoover, Alfred University, 1999. } Hoover&apos;s research suggested half of all college athletes are involved in alcohol-related hazing incidents, while one in five are involved in potentially illegal hazing incidents. Only another one in five was involved in what Hoover described as positive initiation events, such as taking team trips or running obstacle courses. &quot; Athletes most at risk for any kind of hazing for college sports were men; non-Greek members; and either swimmers, divers, soccer players, or lacrosse players. The campuses where hazing was most likely to occur were primarily in eastern or southern states with no anti-hazing laws. The campuses were rural, residential, and had Greek systems, &quot; Hoover wrote. Hoover uses the term &quot; Greek &quot; to refer to U.S.-style fraternities and sororities. Non-fraternity members were most at risk of hazing, Hoover reported. Football players are most at risk of potentially dangerous or illegal hazing, the study found. In the May issue of the American Journal of Emergency Medicine, Michelle Finkel, MD, reported that hazing injuries are often not recognized for their true cause in emergency medical centers. The doctor said hazing victims sometimes hide the real cause of injuries out of shame or to protect those who caused the harm. In protecting their abusers, hazing victims can be compared with victims of domestic violence, Finkel wrote. [ January 2007 ] Finkel cites hazing incidents including &quot; beating or kicking to the point of traumatic injury or death, burning or branding, excessive calisthenics, being forced to eat unpleasant substances, and psychological or sexual abuse of both males and females &quot;. Reported coerced sexual activity is sometimes considered &quot; horseplay &quot; rather than rape, she wrote. Finkel quoted from Hank Nuwer&apos;s book Wrongs of Passage which counted 56 hazing deaths between 1970 and 1999. { The updated list of hazing deaths in colleges is at http://hazing.hanknuwer.com/listoflists.html } Even in the modern western military, which combines discipline with welfare priorities, initiation practices can cause controversy. Although not a part of the training programme of the British Royal Marines, there is a tradition (in many military – especially elite – corps) of subjecting the newly trained ranks to a hell night-like &quot; joining run &quot;, a macho preparation of men in the prime of their lives for the ordeals of warfare, going beyond what most civilians (and even many service personnel) would find acceptable; it usually combines humiliation (such as nudity) with physical endurance. In November 2005, controversy arose over a video showing Royal Marines fighting naked and intoxicated as part of a hazing ritual. The fight culminated with one soldier receiving a kick to the face, rendering him unconscious. [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504191/Police-investigate-video-of-beaten-marine.html Police investigate video of beaten marine 2009-01-30 Catriona Davies 2005-11-28 The Daily Telegraph London ] The victim, according to the BBC, said &quot; It&apos;s just Marine humour &quot;. [ January 2007 ] The Marine who leaked the video said &quot; The guy laid out was inches from being dead &quot;. Under further investigation, the Marines had just returned from a six month tour of Iraq, and were in their &quot; cooling down &quot; period, in which they spend two weeks at a naval base before they are allowed back into society. The man who suffered the kick to the head did not press charges. All Royal Marine recruits endure hazing on induction into their unit usually comprising physical beatings, sexual humiliation and forced drinking of various fluids including cooking oil and human urine. &apos;Kangaroo courts&apos; are common place, officially denied by officers but particularly common amongst returning veterans from conflict zones imposing their &apos;authority&apos; over new recruits, incidents involving other ranks and NCO&apos;s have been reported, punishments on being found &apos;guilty&apos;, include beatings and sleep deprivation. Investigation proves very difficult, since complainants are exposed to significant personal risk from bullying and official denial. In 2008, a national hazing study was conducted by Dr Elizabeth Allan and Dr Mary Madden from the University of Maine. This investigation is the most comprehensive study of hazing to date and includes survey responses from more than 11,000 undergraduate students at 53 colleges and universities in different regions of the U.S. and interviews with more than 300 students and staff at 18 of these campuses. Through the vision and efforts of many, this study fills a major gap in the research and extends the breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding about hazing. Ten initial findings are described in the report, Hazing in View: College Students at Risk. These include: [ Allan Elizabeth Hazing in View: College Students at Risk http://www.hazingstudy.org/publications/hazing_in_view_web.pdf University of Maine, College of Education and Human Development 21 May 2010 Mary Madden 11 March 2008 ] More than half of college students involved in clubs, teams, and organizations experience hazing. Nearly half (47%) of students have experienced hazing prior to coming to college. Alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sex acts are hazing practices common across student groups. [ History of Extreme Hazing Incidences ] Throughout history, hazing has resulted in several deaths and serious injuries. The following is a chronological list of incidents where &quot; hazing &quot; crossed the line of what was socially acceptable and was deemed a criminal act, and the law enacted to combat such acts. • 1626: Francisco de Quevedo includes a scene of students hazing one another in his picaresque novel El Buscón. { Quevedo – El Buscón } • 1684: Cambridge, MA, a Harvard Student, Joseph Webb, was expelled for hazing.

He had been transported to the frat house in a car trunk along with two other pledges. Alfred University has since completely abolished fraternities and sororities. After Chuck&apos;s death, his mother, Eileen Stevens, formed C.H.U.C.K., the committee to halt useless college killings. • 1993-2007: in Indonesia, 35 people died as a result of hazing initiation rites in the Institute of Public Service (IPDN). The latest was in April 2007 when Cliff Muntu died after being beaten by the seniors. { Inu Kencana, Whistleblower from IPDN } • 2005: Matthew Carrington was killed at California &apos;s Chico State University on February 2, 2005. As a result, a number of colleges and parents, sorority and fraternity members are taking steps to bring an end to criminal hazing practices. Colleges and fraternities have also faced civil liability in actions brought for injuries and deaths caused by fraternity hazing. { Drslawfirm.com } Hazing is considered a felony in several U.S. states, and anti-hazing legislation has been proposed in other states. SB 1454, or Matt&apos;s Law, was developed in Carrington&apos;s memory, and a bill was put into law to eliminate hazing in California. • 2004: In Sandwich, MA two Sandwich High School (Massachusetts) football players faced felony charges after a freshman teammate lost his spleen in a hazing ritual. Apparently, a junior on the football team grabbed Garrett’s ankles, lifted him in the air, and then threw him on the ground at the beginning of a practice before the coaches had arrived in what was described as a “freshman beat-down.” The result was a ruptured spleen; the surgeons characterized the force of his hitting the ground as similar to that of a car accident. Due to the injury, the freshman will now require routine immunizations and regular antibiotics to combat the bacteria normally filtered by the spleen for the rest of his life. [ February 2012 ] • 2005: in Russia, the victim of a high-profile hazing attack, Andrei Sychyov required the amputation of his legs and genitalia after he was forced to squat for three hours whilst being beaten and tortured by a group on New Year&apos;s Eve, 2005. The brutal attack on Sychyov, and its horrific consequences highlighted the widespread problem of dedovshchina – or hazing – in the Russian armed forces. [ May 2010 ] • 2007: in Lawrenceville, NJ, Rider University, the Trenton Times reported in April that one fraternity pledge died and another was hospitalized with alcohol poisoning, during what the judge called, &quot; knowingly or recklessly organized, promoted, facilitated or engaged in conduct which resulted in serious bodily injury &quot;. Five people were charged including two university administrators { Administrators Indicted in Hazing Death, August 6, 2007 - 4:00am By Jennifer Epstein } • 2011: in Andover, MA, two Andover High School basketball players were expelled and five were suspended for pressuring underclassmen to play &quot; wet biscuit, &quot; where the loser was forced to eat a semen-soaked cookie. &quot; { http://www.eagletribune.com/opinion/x910015271/Editorial-No-fix-to-end-Andover-hazing-scandal } • 2011: in Florida, thirteen students from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University attacked 23 year old, drum major Robert Champion on a bus after a marching band performance, beating him to death. Since the 2011 death, a series of reports of abuse and hazing within the band have been documented. In May of 2012, 2 faculty members resigned in connection with a hazing investigation and 13 people were charged with felony or misdemeanor hazing crimes. Eleven of those individuals face one count of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death, which is punishable by up to six years in prison. The FAMU incident prompted Florida Governor Rick Scott to order all state universities to examine their hazing and harassment policies in December. Scott also asked all university presidents to remind their students, faculty and staff &quot; how detrimental hazing can be. &quot; { http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/03/justice/florida-hazing-charges/index.html?hpt=us_c2 }. • 2012: in Florida, at the University of Florida; 9 students of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity were accused of &quot; striking the pledges with paddles and/or striking with hands and/or requiring the performance of calisthenics &quot; on January 22, 2012. If convicted, these men could be sentenced to one year in prison and be forced to pay as much as a $1,000 fine { http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/03/justice/florida-hazing-charges/index.html?hpt=us_c2 }. There is anti-hazing legislation in several countries, e.g. in France (the French term is bizutage) imposing a punishment up to six months in prison or 7,500 €. { French Penal Code. Du Bizutage : articles 225-16-1 to 225-16-3 } In the Philippines, hazing accompanied by any forms of temporary or permanent physical injuries (from light injuries to injuries resulting to death), sexual abuse (in any form) or any acts that lead to mental incapacity are punishable by law. Penalties vary depending on how serious the offense is. { The Philippine Anti-Hazing Law. From the Virtual Library of the Chan Robles Law Office (a law firm based in the Philippines) } In India, ragging (as hazing is called there) is legally banned. However, implementation of the law remains problematic because victims rarely speak out. Recently, the Supreme Court of India directed the police to register criminal cases against those accused of ragging. State governments have also been instructed to take a tougher stance on ragging. [ Methods ] [ section May 2007 ] Forced to dress as a maid and clean. Before the Great Depression, U.S. hazing achieved an art form status amongst benevolent fraternities such as the Mooses and the Freemasons. The DeMoulin Catalog is a catalog of many hazing implements used, most famously the electric carpet.In many cases, the hardest abuse is usually only enacted for a photograph (sometimes even posted on the Internet) or video. Reported hazing activities can involve all types of ridicule and humiliation within the group or in public – many of which could easily be considered [ November 2010 ] abusive if a candidate were not a consenting adult – while others are quite innocent, akin to pranks. Spanking is done mainly in the form of paddling among fraternities, sororities and similar (e.g., athletic) clubs, sometimes over a lap, a knee, furniture or a pillow (pile), but mostly with the victim &quot; assuming the position, &quot; i.e., simply bending over forward. A variation of this (also as punishment) is trading licks. This practice is also used in the military (where a new round of hazing can follow a promotion, etc.). Alternative modes (including bare-buttock paddling, strapping and switching, as well as mock forms of antiquated forms of physical punishment s such as stocks, walking the plank and running the gauntlet ) have been reported in the US and other countries, even though all hazing is officially illegal in many states. The hazee may be humiliated by being hosed or by sprinkler, buckets or hoses; covered with dirt or with (sometimes rotten) food, even urinated upon. Olive or baby oil may be used to &quot; show off &quot; the bare skin, for wrestling or just slipperiness, e.g., to complicate pole climbing. Cleaning may be limited to a dive into water, hosing down or even paddling the worst off. They may have to do tedious cleaning including swabbing the decks, cleaning the toilets with a toothbrush. In fraternities, pledges often must clean up a mess intentionally made by brothers which can include fecal matter, urine, and dead animals. Servitude such as waiting on others (as at fraternity parties) or various other forms of housework, often with tests of obedience. In some cases, the hazee may be made to eat raw eggs, peppers, hot sauce, or drink too much alcohol. Some hazing even includes eating or drinking vile things such as bugs or rotting food. The hazee may have to wear an imposed piece of clothing, outfit, item or something else worn by the victim in a way that would bring negative attention to the wearer. Examples include a uniform (e.g. toga, especially in Greek societies); a leash and/or collar (also associated with SM bondage); infantile and other humiliating dress and attire (e.g., diapers [ January 2012 ], underwear (sometimes of the opposite sex; sometimes wet to make it see-through) or a condom on the head); cross-dress or fake breasts; wearing just a box or a barrel; bunny costume; a phallus or dildo, even in explicitly homo-erotic poses. In some cases, the hazee may be completely or partially in a state of nudity (with or without cupping of the genitals). A variation in use in Germany is the &quot; clothesline &quot;, i.e., contributing garments (usually remaining decent, e.g., in swim suit) to form a long line. In Sweden, gymnasium (high school, 16 to 19 years old) and university also use the clothes line. Girls strip to their thong, boys strip to their underwear. [ May 2010 ] { Branding as fraternity initiation } Markings may also be made on clothing or bare skin. They are painted, written, tattooed or shaved on, sometimes collectively forming a message (one letter, syllable or word on each pledge) or may receive tarring and feathering (or rather a mock version using some glue) or branding. If half-naked, topless or with bare feet, the victim may be subjected to thorough and prolonged tickling until helpless with laughter, sometimes in order to extract a promise or pledge to the group, sometimes merely to elicit a confession of ticklishness. Submission to the seniors is common. Abject &quot; etiquette &quot; required of pledges or subordinates may include prostration, kneeling, literal groveling, kissing/licking/washing/worshipping/massaging/rubbing/sucking/ body parts usually genitalia. Other physical feats may be required, such as calisthenics and other physical tests, such as push-ups (sometimes a hazer keeps his/her foot on the pledges&apos; back), jumping jacks (under near impossible conditions), sit-up s, mud wrestling, forming a human pyramid or dog piling, climbing a greased pole, skinny diving, leap-frog, human wheel-barrow etc., often with some twist. Exposure to the elements may be required, such as swimming or diving in cold water or snow. Degrading positions and tasks include being locked up in a cage or barrel, commanded to move on all fours or crawl on their bellies, eat or fetch &quot; doggy style &quot;, kiss or urinate in public. The Elephant Walk, a process where pledges grab one another&apos;s genitalia and march to the beat of the Pink Panther, is also a common form of hazing. Orientation tests may be held, such as abandoning pledges far or fettered without transport, in the dark and/or in a public place. Dares include jumping from some height (bungee or in water), stealing from police or rival teams and obedience. Blood pinning among military aviators (and many other elite groups) to celebrate becoming new pilots by piercing their chests with the sharp pins of aviator wings. On his first crossing the equator in military and commercial navigation, each &quot; pollywog &quot; (sailor; sometimes even passengers) is subjected to a series of endurances usually including running and/or crawling a gauntlet of abuse (soiling, paddling, etc.) and various scenes supposedly situated at King Neptune&apos;s court. A pledge auction is a variation on the slave auction, where people bid on the paraded (often exposed) pledges. It is held either as an open fund raiser where the general public (or just an invited sorority) can bid, or internally to decide which brother can impose his fantasies on which pledge. Sometimes, male pledges&apos; prices depend on how little clothing the boy is allowed to wear. The &quot; slaves &quot; must do whatever the master orders, such as bringing drinks or preparing food. The Happy Corner, known in Taiwan as aluba ( &quot; hitting the tree &quot; ), Hong Kong (as corning or being corned), and Norway (as &quot; stolping &quot;, &quot; poling &quot; or &quot; gjelling &quot;, &quot; gelding &quot; ), involves rubbing a lifted boy&apos;s groin against a tree or pole. Treeing is binding up with ropes, chains, handcuffs or other means, to a tree or pole, or in some variations on a cross (mock crucifixion ) wearing only a loincloth, underwear, a diapers [ January 2012 ], or sometimes even nothing at all, to be helplessly abused and/or bound. The term tunnel seems to have various meanings in different traditions, such as a spanking tunnel or belt-line. It may be appealing as a symbolic rite of passage: one goes in as a rookie and emerges as something of a brother or teammate. Hazing also occurs for apprentices in some trades. In printing, it consists of applying bronze blue to the apprentice&apos;s penis and testicles, a color made by mixing black printers ink and dark blue printers ink, which takes a long time to wash off. Similarly, mechanics get their groins smeared with old dirty grease. [ February 2011 ] [ Psychology, purpose, and role ] Hazing supposedly serves a deliberate purpose, of building solidarity. Psychologist Robert Cialdini uses the framework of consistency and commitment to explain the phenomenon of hazing, and the vigor and zeal to which practitioners of hazing persist in and defend these activities even when they are made illegal. { Robert Cialdini, Influence: Science and Practice, 4th Ed, Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2001. (pp. 76–78) } Cialdini cites a 1959 study in which the researchers observed that &quot; persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort. &quot; { Elliott Aronson, Judson Mills, &quot; The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group &quot;, &apos;&apos;Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology&apos;&apos;, Vol. 59, No. 2, Sep. 1959, pp. 177–181. } [ Fiction ] [ November 2009 ] Films where hazing plays an important part in the plot and/or constitutes a forceful scene include if...., Fraternity Row (film), National Lampoon&apos;s Animal House, Hell Night, Full Metal Jacket, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama (female pledges paddled during initiation ritual), Dazed and Confused (high school freshmen are put through many rituals, including fake &quot; air raids &quot;, being covered in food, spanked with a paddle, and forced to lie in a trucks bed while it goes through the car wash), A Few Good Men, The Lords of Discipline, The Skulls, Old School, Jarhead, &apos;&apos; The Good Shepherd &quot;.
