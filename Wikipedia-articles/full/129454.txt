Over the next forty years the town grew quickly, attaining a population of 3,021 people in 1880. By 1880 two railroad lines passed through the community, helping to spur economic and population growth. In 1886 two newspaper offices, eight churches, and two banks existed in Jackson. The largest businesses in the town were the Star Furnace Company and the Globe Iron Company with thirty employees apiece. Both firms used local coal and iron ore deposits to make iron products. Jackson continued to grow during the twentieth century. Jackson was the county&apos;s largest community in 2000, with a population of 6,184 people.
