[ the British author E. Nesbit ] [ January 2011 ] [ 1884 12 25 y ] { Tarentum, Pennsylvania } [ 1967 1 17 1884 12 25 y ] { Santa Monica, California } [ * Evelyn Nesbit-Thaw * Evelyn Nesbit Thaw ] { Model, chorus girl, actress } { American } { Scots-Irish } [ * Harry Kendall Thaw (April 4, 1905 – 1915) * Jack Clifford (1915–1933) ] { Russell William Thaw } Evelyn Nesbit (December 25, 1884 – January 17, 1967) was an American artists&apos; model and chorus girl, noted for her entanglement in the murder of her ex-lover, architect Stanford White, by her first husband, Harry Kendall Thaw. [ Early life ] She was born Florence Evelyn Nesbit on December 25, 1884, in Tarentum, a small village near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She was of Scots-Irish ancestry. As a child, Florence Evelyn was strikingly beautiful, but quiet and somewhat shy. { EvelynNesbit.com } She had a younger brother, Howard. The Nesbit family moved to Pittsburgh around 1893, when Evelyn was still a schoolgirl. Her father, a struggling lawyer named Winfield Scott Nesbit, died that year, leaving behind substantial debts; his wife and two children were nearly destitute. For years Evelyn and her mother and younger brother lived in near-poverty, but by the time she reached adolescence her startling beauty came to the attention of several local artists, including John Storm, and she was able to find employment as an artists&apos; model. [ Modeling career ] { James Carroll Beckwith, &apos;&apos;Portrait of Evelyn Nesbitt,&apos;&apos; c. 1901. } 1901 photograph by Rudolf Eickemeyer, Jr. In 1901, when Nesbit was sixteen, she and her mother moved into a tiny room at 249 W. 22nd Street in New York City. Her mother had difficulty in finding work and after several weeks, Evelyn persuaded her to let her model again. Using a letter of introduction from a Philadelphia artist, Evelyn met and posed for James Carroll Beckwith, who introduced her to other New York artists. Soon she began modeling for artists Frederick S. Church, Herbert Morgan, Gertrude Käsebier, Carl Blenner and photographer Rudolf Eickemeyer, Jr. Eventually, Evelyn became one of the most in-demand artists&apos; models in New York. Charles Dana Gibson, one of the most popular artists in the country at the time, rendered a pen-and-ink profile of Evelyn with her red hair arranged in the form of a question mark. The work, titled &quot; The Eternal Question &quot;, remains one of Gibson&apos;s best known works and Evelyn entered the ranks of the famous turn-of-the-century &quot; Gibson Girl s. &quot; Photographic fashion modeling, which was becoming more popular in daily newspaper s, proved to be even more lucrative for Evelyn. Photographer Joel Feder would pay her $5 for a half-day shoot or $10 for a full day shoot (about $260 per day in 2010 dollars). Evelyn soon made more than enough money to support her family. [ Relationships ] [ Stanford White ] circa 1902 As a chorus girl on Broadway in 1901, Nesbit was introduced to acclaimed architect Stanford White by Edna Goodrich, { Prodigal Days; Evelyn Nesbit, Julian Messner Publishers, New York, 1934, page 3. } who was a member along with Nesbit in the company performing Florodora at the Casino Theatre on Broadway. White—a notorious womanizer known as &quot; Stanny &quot; by his close friends and relatives—was then 47 years of age to her 16. White had a loft apartment on West Twenty-fourth Street above FAO Schwarz with its walkup doorway situated next to the toy store&apos;s back delivery entrance. In her memoir Prodigal Days, Nesbit described her introduction to White at the apartment, decorated with heavy red velvet curtains and fine paintings, where White and a man named Reginald Ronalds poured her a glass of champagne and led her upstairs to a studio outfitted with a red velvet swing. { Prodigal Days; Evelyn Nesbit, Julian Messner Publishers, New York, 1934, page 27. } While nothing untoward occurred on that first visit, the swing would later become notorious as accounts of its use were aired in the course of a murder trial, and some sources incorrectly state the activities that formed the basis for the 1955 film The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing took place at the &quot; Tower Room &quot; at the old Madison Square Garden, where White kept an office. [ http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/nyregion/thecity/04swin.html The Girl, the Swing and a Row House in Ruins Dworin Caroline H. 2007-11-04 New York Times 2008-08-19 ] Nesbit states specifically that the swing and its related activities took place at the apartment on West Twenty-fourth Street. Although White reportedly derived sexual pleasure by pushing young women in the swing, naked or nearly so, as Nesbit later testified in court, she claimed her own later nude escapades with White were simply for his &quot; aesthetic &quot; delight. Stanford White had endeared himself to Nesbit&apos;s mother by making arrangements for her son to be admitted to the Chester Military Academy near Philadelphia, and she placed so much trust in the architect that when she arranged an out-of-town trip, Stanford White and Evelyn Nesbit saw her off at the train station, where she left her daughter in his care. { Prodigal Days; Evelyn Nesbit, Julian Messner Publishers, New York, 1934, page 37. } Nesbit with flowers and headband Several nights after her mother left for Pittsburgh, Nesbit was summoned to the apartment by White, where the two shared dinner and several glasses of champagne before she was given a tour that ended in the &quot; Mirror Room. &quot; On the same upper floor as the studio featuring the velvet swing, the ten-by-ten room held a green velvet-covered couch and walls and ceilings covered with mirrors. Later, after more champagne, the two returned downstairs and Nesbit tried on a yellow satin kimono before she &quot; passed out. &quot; She recounted that she awoke in bed, nearly naked with White lying beside her, and that she &quot; entered that room a virgin, &quot; but did not come out as one. { Prodigal Days; Evelyn Nesbit, Julian Messner Publishers, New York, 1934, page 41. } Later, Nesbit related this story to millionaire Harry Thaw after he repeatedly hounded her to know why she refused to marry him. She later did, but at the end of her life, Nesbit claimed that the charismatic &quot; Stanny &quot; was the only man she had ever loved. [ John Barrymore ] As White moved on to other young, virginal women, Nesbit was courted by the young John Barrymore, beginning in 1901. The two met when Barrymore caught a performance of Florodora and sent flowers backstage. Barrymore, who was from a well known theatrical family, was then 19 and seeking a career in cartooning. He was considered too poor by her mother to be a suitable match for the 17-year-old Nesbit. Her mother and White were enraged when they found out about the relationship. However, Nesbit was finally smitten with someone her own age and often returned to Barrymore&apos;s apartment after hours. White, still a strong influence in her life, arranged to send her away to a boarding school in Wayne, New Jersey (run by the mother of film director Cecil B. DeMille ) in part to extricate her from John Barrymore. Barrymore in the meantime proposed marriage to Nesbit, in the presence of Mrs Nesbit and White, but Evelyn turned down his offer. { Harry Kendall Thaw, husband of Evelyn Nesbit } [ Harry Kendall Thaw ] Stanford White and John Barrymore were subsequently supplanted in Nesbit&apos;s life by Harry Kendall Thaw (1871–1947) of Pittsburgh, the son of a coal and railroad baron. Prior to her relationship with Thaw, Nesbit dated a well known polo player named James Montgomery Waterbury (1875–1920) and the young magazine publisher Robert J. Collier. Thaw was extremely possessive of Nesbit (he reportedly carried a pistol), and obsessive about the details of her relationship with White (whom he referred to as &quot; The Beast &quot; ). Thaw was a cocaine addict and allegedly a sadist who subjected women—including Nesbit—and the occasional adolescent boy to severe whippings. However, following a trip to Europe, Nesbit finally accepted Thaw&apos;s repeated marriage proposal. They were wed on April 4, 1905, when Nesbit was twenty. Nesbit had one child, Russell William Thaw, who was born in Berlin on October 25, 1910 (he died in 1984 at Santa Barbara, California). A noted aircraft pilot in World War II, as a child he appeared in Hollywood films with his mother. The identity of his father, however, remains in doubt. While Thaw swore he was not the child&apos;s father (he was conceived and born during Thaw&apos;s confinement), Nesbit always insisted that he was. [ Murder of Stanford White ] On June 25, 1906, Nesbit and Thaw saw White at the restaurant Café Martin and ran into him again later that night in the audience of the Madison Square Garden&apos;s roof theatre at a performance of Mam&apos;zelle Champagne, written by Edgar Allan Woolf. During the song &quot; I Could Love A Million Girls &quot;, Thaw fired three shots at close range into White&apos;s face, killing him instantly and reportedly exclaiming, &quot; You&apos;ll never go out with that woman again. &quot; { Thaw Murders Stanford White New York Times; June 26, 1906; page 1. } In his book The Murder of Stanford White, Gerald Langford quoted Thaw as saying &quot; You ruined my life, &quot; or &quot; You ruined my wife, &quot; and the New York Times account the following day stated &quot; Another witness said the word was &quot; wife &quot; instead of &quot; life &quot; &quot; in response to the arresting officer&apos;s report otherwise. Harry Thaw was tried twice for the murder of Stanford White. At the first, the jury was deadlocked; at the second (in which Nesbit testified in his behalf), Thaw pleaded temporary insanity. Thaw&apos;s mother (usually referred to as &quot; Mother Thaw &quot; ) promised Nesbit that if she would testify that White had raped her and that Thaw had only tried to avenge her honor, she would receive a quiet divorce and a one million dollar divorce settlement. Nesbit got the divorce, but never saw a cent of the million. Immediately following Thaw&apos;s acquittal, she was cut off financially by Thaw&apos;s mother. Thaw was incarcerated at the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Beacon, New York, but enjoyed almost total freedom. Still, he tried to escape a couple of times to Canada. In 1913, he strolled out of the asylum and was driven over the Canadian border into Sherbrooke, Quebec. He was extradited back to the U.S., but in 1915 was released from custody after being judged sane. [ Later years ] In the years following the second trial, Nesbit&apos;s careers as a vaudeville performer, silent film actress and cafe manager were only modestly successful, her life marred by suicide attempts. In 1914, she appeared in Threads of Destiny produced at the Betzwood studios of film producer Siegmund Lubin. { Prodigal Days; Evelyn Nesbit, Julian Messner Publishers, New York, 1934, page 276. } In 1916, after her divorce from Thaw, she married her dancing partner, Jack Clifford (1880–1956, born Virgil James Montani). He left her in 1918, and she divorced him in 1933. In 1926 Nesbit gave an interview to the New York Times, stating that she and Thaw had reconciled, but nothing came of the renewed relationship. Nesbit published two memoirs, The Story Of My Life (1914), and Prodigal Days (1934). She lived quietly for several years in Northfield, New Jersey. She overcame suicide attempts, alcoholism, and an addiction to morphine, and in her later years taught classes in ceramics. She was a technical adviser on the 1955 movie The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing. [ Death ] She died in a nursing home in Santa Monica, California, on January 17, 1967, at the age of 82.
