[ 6 ] [ History ] Jackson County was formed in 1816. It was named for Andrew Jackson, who defeated the British in 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812,and then Signed the Indian Removal Act sending all Indians in Indiana west. He had become president at the time. Jackson County was the site of the first recorded train robbery of a moving train in the United States. On October 6, 1866 the Reno Gang robbed an Ohio and Mississippi Railway train making off with over $10,000.They were nicknamed: &quot; The Jackson Theives &quot; later on. { http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=VideoArticle &amp; id=51742 } Jackson County is home to the longest 3-span covered bridge in the world; The Medora Covered Bridge. However, due to decades of neglect the bridge is on the verge of collapse and has been closed to pedestrian traffic. Another long neglected covered bridge, the Bells Ford Bridge, which is believed the last remaining Post Truss bridge in the world, succumbed to similar neglect, collapsing into the White River on January 2, 2006. Because the Bell&apos;s Ford Bridge used a metal truss it was able to be largely salvaged, however, the Commissioner President Gary Darlage has been quoted as saying: &quot; There is nothing left of the Bell Ford Bridge and I will not spend another tax dollar on it. Ninety percent of the people in this county think it is asinine to even consider rebuilding that bridge. By asking for any amount of money to be used on it, you are asking me to do something I don’t believe is right. &quot; Although it has been brought to Darlage&apos;s attention that federal funds could be used to restore the Bell&apos;s Ford Bridge, Darlage has refused to request federal funds, saying, &quot; I guess I’m just not a historic person. The average taxpayer sees it as their tax money, even if it is federal money. &quot; [ August 2008 ] [ Geography ] According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of [ 513.91 sqmi ], of which [ 509.31 sqmi ] (or 99.10%) is land and [ 4.60 sqmi ] (or 0.90%) is water.
