[ 90 N 0 W title ] { Azimuthal projection showing the Arctic Ocean and the North Pole. } North Pole scenery The North Pole, also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is, subject to the caveats explained below, defined as the point in the Northern Hemisphere where the Earth&apos;s axis of rotation meets its surface. It should not be confused with the North Magnetic Pole. The North Pole is the northernmost point on Earth, lying diametrically opposite the South Pole. It defines geodetic latitude 90° North, as well as the direction of true north. At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of longitude converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. While the South Pole lies on a continental land mass, the North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole (unlike the South Pole). However, the Soviet Union, and later Russia, have constructed a number of manned drifting stations on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. In recent years, a number of studies have predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free due to Arctic shrinkage, with timescales varying from next year [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13002706 ] [ http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/05/us-canada-arctic-idUSTRE52468B20090305 ] to fifty years or more. The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at [ 4261 m on ] by the Russian Mir submersible in 2007 { Russian sub plants flag at North Pole, Reuters, Aug 2, 2007 } and at 4,087 m (13,410 ft) by USS &apos;&apos;Nautilus&apos;&apos; in 1958.

The nearest permanently inhabited place is Alert in the Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada, which is located [ 817 km on ] from the Pole. [ Precise definition ] [ Polar motion ] The Earth&apos;s axis of rotation  – and hence the position of the North Pole  – was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician Leonhard Euler predicted that the axis might &quot; wobble &quot; slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent &quot; variation of latitude, &quot; as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth&apos;s surface, by a range of a few meters. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the 8 month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the Chandler wobble after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth&apos;s axis and the Earth&apos;s surface, at any given moment, is called the &quot; instantaneous pole &quot;, but because of the &quot; wobble &quot; this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required. It is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or orography ) to fixed landforms. Of course, given plate tectonics and isostasy, there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service and the International Astronomical Union have defined a framework called the International Terrestrial Reference System. [ Expeditions ] [ Arctic exploration Farthest North List of Arctic expeditions List of firsts in the Geographic North Pole ] [ Pre-1900 ] { Gerardus Mercator &apos;s map of the North Pole from 1595 } As early as the 16th century, many eminent people correctly believed that the North Pole was in a sea, which in the 19th century was called the Polynya or Open Polar Sea. { John K. Wright Geographical Review, Vol. 43, No. 3. (Jul., 1953), pp. 338–365 &quot; The Open Polar Sea &quot; } It was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year. Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes. One of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer William Edward Parry, who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. In 1871 the Polaris expedition, a US attempt on the Pole led by Charles Francis Hall, ended in disaster. Another British Royal Navy attempt on the pole, part of the British Arctic Expedition, by Commander Albert H. Markham reached a then-record 83°20&apos;26 &quot; North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879–1881 expedition commanded by US naval officer George W. DeLong ended tragically when their ship the USS &apos;&apos;Jeanette&apos;&apos;, was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including DeLong, were lost. Nansen&apos;s ship &apos;&apos;Fram&apos;&apos; in the Arctic ice In April 1895 the Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen&apos;s icebound ship Fram. The pair reached latitude 86°14′ North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching Franz Josef Land. In 1897 Swedish engineer Salomon August Andrée and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon Örnen ( &quot; Eagle &quot; ), but were stranded [ 300 km on ] north of Kvitøya, the northeasternmost part of the Svalbard archipelago, and perished on this lonely island. In 1930 the remains of this expedition were found by the Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition. The Italian explorer Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi and Captain Umberto Cagni of the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) sailed the converted whaler Stella Polare ( &quot; Pole Star &quot; ) from Norway in 1899. On March 11, 1900 Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86° 34’ on April 25, setting a new record by beating Nansen&apos;s result of 1895 by [ 35 to 40 km on ]. Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until June 23. On August 16 the Stella Polare left Rudolf Island heading south and the expedition returned to Norway. [ 1900–1940 ] Peary&apos;s sledge party &quot; at the North Pole, &quot; 1909. From left: Ooqueah, Ootah, Henson, Egingwah, Seeglo. http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/pearyfrontis.html At the North Pole, 6–7 April 1909: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Web Heritage.nf.ca 2011-02-16 The US explorer Frederick Cook claimed to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 with two Inuit men, Ahwelah and Etukishook, but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted. { Robert Bryce Cook and Peary: the Polar Controversy Resolved Stackpole 1997; Henderson, B. (2005) True North W W Norton &amp; Company ISBN 0-393-32738-8 } The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to US Navy engineer Robert Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on 6 April 1909, accompanied by Matthew Henson and four Inuit men, Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary&apos;s claim remains controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole. The distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary&apos;s account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line  – the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing  – is contradicted by Henson&apos;s account of tortuous detours to avoid pressure ridge s and open lead s. The British explorer Wally Herbert, initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary&apos;s records in 1989 and concluded that they must have been falsified and that Peary had not reached the Pole. [ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html Obituary, &apos; &amp; #39;The Independent&apos; &amp; #39; 16 June 2007 Independent.co.uk 16 February ] Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer Tom Avery and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary&apos;s journey with replica wooden sleds and Canadian Eskimo Dog teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours  – nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery&apos;s fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles, significantly short of the 135 claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that &quot; The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia. Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole. &quot; { Tom Avery website, retrieved May 2007 } { Ivan Papanin at } { North Pole-1 drifting station, 1937 } Another rejection of Peary&apos;s claim arrived in 2009, when E. Myles Standish of the California Institute of Technology, an experienced referee of scientific claims, reported numerous alleged lacunae and inconsistencies. { Roald Amundsen First to Each Pole - Three Prior North Pole Claims: Each Unproven &amp; Highly Suspect } The first claimed flight over the Pole was made on 9 May 1926 by US naval officer Richard E. Byrd and pilot Floyd Bennett in a Fokker tri-motor aircraft. Although verified at the time by a committee of the National Geographic Society, this claim has since been undermined { The North Pole Flight of Richard E.

The flight started from Svalbard in Norway, and crossed the Arctic Ocean to Alaska. Nobile, with several scientists and crew from the Norge, overflew the Pole a second time on 24 May 1928, in the airship Italia. The Italia crashed on its return from the Pole, with the loss of half the crew. In May 1937 the world&apos;s first North Pole ice station, North Pole-1, was established by Soviet scientists 20 kilometres (13 mi) from the North Pole. The expedition members: oceanographer Pyotr Shirshov, meteorologist Yevgeny Fyodorov, radio operator Ernst Krenkel, and the leader Ivan Papanin [ http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid%3D66677 North Pole Drifting Stations (1930s-1980s) 2012-01-08 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution 2011-08-17 ] conducted scientific research at the station for the next nine months.

On March 17, 1959, the USS Skate (SSN-578) surfaced at the Pole, becoming the first naval vessel to do so. [ Ned Harris (USCS # 3608) Cover carried aboard U.S.S.

The United States Air Force independently confirmed their position. On April 6, 1969, Wally Herbert and companions Allan Gill, Roy Koerner and Kenneth Hedges of the British Trans-Arctic Expedition became the first men to reach the North Pole on foot (albeit with the aid of dog teams and airdrop s ). They continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean  – and by its longest axis, Barrow, Alaska to Svalbard  – a feat that has never been repeated. { Obituary of Sir Wally Herbert, Times Online, 13 June 2007 } { Obituary of Sir Wally Herbert, Guardian Unlimited, 15 June 2007 } Because of suggestions (later proven false) of Plaisted&apos;s use of air transport, some sources classify Herbert&apos;s expedition as the first confirmed to reach the North Pole over the ice surface by any means. { northpolewomen.com } In the 1980&apos;s, Plaisted&apos;s pilots Weldy Phipps and Ken Lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was provided.

In 1982 Ranulph Fiennes and Charles R. Burton became the first people to cross the Arctic Ocean in a single season. They departed from Cape Crozier, Ellesmere Island, on February 17, 1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on April 10, 1982. They travelled on foot and snowmobile. From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship MV Benjamin Bowring and boarded it on August 4, 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result of this journey, which formed a section of the three-year Transglobe Expedition 1979–1982, Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone. This achievement remains unchallenged to this day. In 1985, Sir Edmund Hillary (the first man to stand on the summit of Mount Everest) and Neil Armstrong (the first man to stand on the moon) landed at the North Pole in a small twin-engined ski plane. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest. In 1986, Will Steger, with seven teammates, became the first to be confirmed as reaching the Pole by dogsled and without resupply. On September 7, 1991, the German research vessel &apos;&apos;Polarstern&apos;&apos; and the Swedish icebreaker &apos;&apos;Oden&apos;&apos; reached the North Pole as the first conventional powered vessels. { Fütterer, D. et al.

Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years. The first attempt at underwater exploration of the North Pole was made by a Russian firefighter and diver Andrei Rozhkov with a support of Diving Club of Moscow State University on April 22, 1998 but ended in fatality.

[ Day and night ] The sun at the North Pole is continuously above the horizon during the summer and continuously below the horizon during the winter. Sunrise is just before the March equinox (around March 19); the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23½° elevation at the summer solstice (around June 21), after which time it begins to sink, reaching sunset just after the September equinox (around September 24). When the sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox. A civil twilight period of about two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset, a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset. These effects are caused by a combination of the Earth&apos;s axial tilt and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earth&apos;s axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth&apos;s orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference. [ Time ] In most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole, and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as Greenwich Mean Time, or the time zone of the country they departed from. [ Climate ] { Arctic shrinkage s of 2007 compared to 2005 and also compared to the 1979–2000 average. } The North Pole is significantly warmer than the South Pole because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude in a continental land mass. Winter (January) temperatures at the North Pole can range from about [ -43 C 0 ] to [ -26 C 0 ], perhaps averaging around [ -34 C 0 ]. Summer temperatures (June, July and August) average around the freezing point ( [ 0 C 0 ] ). The highest temperature yet recorded is [ 5 C 0 ], much warmer than the South Pole&apos;s record high of only [ -13.5 C ]. { &quot; Science question of the week &quot;, Goddard Space Center } The sea ice at the North Pole is typically around [ 2 to 3 m on ] thick, { Beyond &quot; Polar Express &quot; : Fast Facts on the Real North Pole, National Geographic News } although ice thickness, its spatial extent, and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate. [ Sea Ice http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/sotc/sea_ice.html Sate of the Cryosphere NSIDC 6 March 2012 ] Studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years. { &quot; Arctic ice thickness drops by up to 19 per cent &quot;, Daily Telegraph, 28 October 2008 } It is likely that global warming has contributed to this, but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the Arctic. [ Model-Based Estimates of Change http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch4s4-4-3-4.html IPCC 6 March 2012 ] Reports have also predicted that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer. { Arctic sea ice &quot; faces rapid melt &quot;, BBC news story, December 2006 } This may have significant commercial implications; see &quot; Territorial Claims, &quot; below. The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming, as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation, and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation. [ Future of Arctic Climate and Global Impacts http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/future/heat.html NOAA 6 March 2012 ] [ Flora and fauna ] Polar bear s are believed rarely to travel beyond about 82° North owing to the scarcity of food, though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole, and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just [ 1 mi on ] from the Pole. { Polar Bear  – Population &amp; Distribution, WWF, January 2007 } { Explorers&apos; Blog, Greenpeace Project Thin Ice, 1 July 2006 } The ringed seal has also been seen at the Pole, and Arctic fox es have been observed less than [ 60 km on ] away at 89°40′  N. { Ringed seal makes its home on the ice, Antti Halkka } { The Arctic Fox, Magnus Tannerfeldt } Birds seen at or very near the Pole include the Snow Bunting, Northern Fulmar and Black-legged Kittiwake, though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions. [ http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic56-3-309.pdf FARTHEST NORTH POLAR BEAR (Ursus maritimus) PDF 2011-02-16 ] Fish have been seen in the waters at the North Pole, but these are probably few in number. A member of the Russian team that descended to the North Pole seabed in August 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there. However, it was later reported that a sea anemone had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the Russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified shrimp s and amphipods. { &quot; North Pole sea anemone named most northerly species &quot;, Observer, 2 August 2009 } [ Territorial claims to the North Pole and Arctic regions ] [ Territorial claims in the Arctic ] { Under } { international law, no country currently owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The five surrounding Arctic countries, Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark (via Greenland), and the United States (via Alaska), are limited to a } [ 200 nmi on in ] { exclusive economic zone around their coasts, and the area beyond that is administered by the } { International Seabed Authority. } Upon ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a country has a ten year period to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200 mile exclusive economic zone. If accepted, such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone. [ http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/annex2.htm United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Annex 2, Article 4) 2007-07-26 ] Norway (ratified the convention in 1996 [ February 2011 ] ), Russia (ratified in 1997 ), Canada (ratified in 2003 ) and Denmark (ratified in 2004 ) have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of Arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation. [ http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/arctic.pdf Territorial claims in the Arctic PDF 2011-02-16 ] { The Battle for the Next Energy Frontier: The Russian Polar Expedition and the Future of Arctic Hydrocarbons, by Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff and Timothy Fenton Krysiek, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, August 2007 } In 1907 Canada invoked a &quot; sector principle &quot; to claim sovereignty over a sector stretching from its coasts to the North Pole. Although this claim has not been relinquished, neither has it been consistently pressed. [ http://www.carc.org/pubs/v22no4/loss.htm Northern Perspectives (Volume 22, Number 4, Winter 1994-95) CARC 2011-02-16 ] [ Cultural associations ] In some Western culture s, the geographic North Pole is described as being the location of the workshop and residence of Santa Claus, although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic North Pole. Canada Post has assigned postal code H0H 0H0 to the North Pole (referring to Santa&apos;s traditional exclamation of &quot; Ho ho ho ! &quot; ). { &quot; Canada Post Launches 24th Annual Santa Letter-writing Program &quot;, Canada Post press release, November 15, 2006 } This association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of Hyperborea that posits the North Pole, the otherworldly world-axis, as the abode of God and superhuman beings (see Joscelyn Godwin, Arktos: The Polar Myth). The popular figure of the pole-dwelling Santa Claus thus functions as an archetype of spiritual purity and transcendence. { Pole-Spirits North and South } As Henry Corbin has documented, the North Pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of Sufism and Iranian mysticism. &quot; The Orient sought by the mystic, the Orient that cannot be located on our maps, is in the direction of the north, beyond the north. &quot; { Corbin, The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism, trans. N. Pearson, 1978 } Owing to its remoteness, the Pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient Islam ic tradition called Mount Qaf (Jabal Qaf), the &quot; farthest point of the earth &quot;. { Ibrahim Muhawi &amp; Sharif Kanaana. Speak, Bird, Speak Again: Palestinian Arab Folktales. Berkeley University of California Press } { Irgam Yigfagna; al-Jabal al-Lamma } According to certain authors, the Jabal Qaf of Muslim cosmology is a version of Rupes Nigra, a mountain whose ascent, like Dante&apos;s climbing of the Mountain of Purgatory, represents the pilgrim&apos;s progress through spiritual states. { Irgam Yigfagna; al-Jabal al-Lamma, p. 44 } In Iranian theosophy, the heavenly Pole, the focal point of the spiritual ascent, acts as a magnet to draw beings to its &quot; palaces ablaze with immaterial matter. &quot; { Irgam Yigfagna; al-Jabal al-Lamma, p. 11 } Fantasy flight s often refer to a flight to the North Pole for these same reasons.
