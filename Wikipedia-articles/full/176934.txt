The Finnish nickname for I-16 was Siipiorava ( &quot; } { Flying Squirrel &quot; ). } [ Design and development ] While working on the Polikarpov I-15 biplane, Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov began designing an advanced monoplane fighter. It featured cutting-edge innovations such as retractable landing gear and a fully enclosed cockpit, and was optimized for speed with a short stubby fuselage (similar to Gee Bee R-1 ) and a Wright Cyclone radial engine in a NACA cowling. The aircraft was small, light and simple to build. Full scale work on the TsKB-12 prototype began in June 1933 and the aircraft was accepted into production on 22 November 1933, a month before it took to the air. The TsKB-12 was of mixed construction using a wooden monocoque fuselage and wings based around a KhMA chrome-molybdenum steel alloy wing spar, dural ribs and D1 aluminum alloy skinning on the center and leading edges, with the remaining portions of the wings fabric covered. Another modern feature were the aileron s which ran almost the entire trailing edge of the wing and also operated as flaps (in the manner of more modern flaperon s ) by drooping 15°. The cockpit was covered by a 40  cm (16  in) wide canopy which featured an Aldis tubular gun sight which could slide back and forth on runners fitted with bungee cords of rubber. A 225  l (59.4  US gal) fuel tank was fitted directly in front of the cockpit. The main landing gear was fully retractable by a hand-crank. The armament consisted of a pair of 7.62  mm (0.30  in) ShKAS machine gun s in the wings, mounted on the outboard side of the main gear and carried 900 rounds of ammunition. These features were proposed at first by Andrei N. Tupolev, however the NII VVS was more concerned about the stresses a typical combat aircraft was subjected to in combat, and initially considered the risk too great. However TsAGI, with the help of the 3rd Design Brigade under the leadership of Pavel O. Sukhoi and Aleksandr P. Putylov eventually convinced NII VVS that what was being proposed was not only feasible, but would enhance the aircraft&apos;s performance. The TsKB-12 was designed around the Wright Cyclone SR-1820-F-3 nine cylinder radial engine (rated at 529  kW/710  hp); a license to build this engine was being negotiated. As the license was not yet approved, Polikarpov was asked to settle for the less powerful M-22 (Soviet-built version of the Gnome-Rhone Jupiter 9ASB which itself was a licensed version of the Bristol Jupiter VI) with 358  kW (480  hp). This was deemed acceptable because the projected top speed still exceeded 300  km/h (185  mph). The M-22 powered TsKB-12 first took to the air on 30 December 1933 with the famous Soviet test pilot Valery Chkalov at the controls. The second TsKB-12 with a Cyclone engine and three-bladed propeller flew in January of the following year. Initial government trials in February 1934 revealed very good maneuverability but the aircraft did not tolerate abrupt control inputs. Thus the TsKB-12 was deemed dangerous to fly and all aerobatic s were forbidden. The M-22 version was preferred due to vibration of the Cyclone-powered aircraft. Pilots commented early on the difficulty of climbing into the cockpit, a trait that persisted through I-16&apos;s service life. Before continuing test flights the designers had to answer the question of spin behavior. Wind tunnel testing suggested that TsKB-12 with its short tail would enter an unrecoverable flat spin, but real-life trials were necessary to confirm this. Since Cyclone engines were rare it was decided to risk the M-22 prototype for this purpose. On 1 March and 2 March 1934, Chkalov performed 75 spins and discovered that the aircraft had very benign stall behavior (dipping a wing and recovering without input from the pilot when airspeed increased) and intentional spins could be easily terminated by placing controls in the neutral position. The stories of vicious spin behavior of the I-16 perpetuated in modern literature is unfounded (perhaps extrapolated from Gee Bee experience). In fact, the I-16&apos;s stablemate, the biplane Polikarpov I-153, exhibited much worse spin characteristics. Service trials of the new fighter, designated I-16, began on 22 March 1934. The M-22 prototype reached 359  km/h (223  mph). The manually retracted landing gear was prone to jamming and required considerable strength from the pilot. Most of the test flights were performed with the gear extended. On 1 May 1934, the M-22 prototype participated in the flyover of the Red Square. Approximately 30 I-16 Type 1 aircraft were delivered, but were not assigned to any VVS fighter squadron. Most pilots who flew the I-16 Type 1 for evaluation purposes did not find the aircraft to have many redeeming characteristics. Regardless of pilot opinion, much attention was focused on the Cyclone powered aircraft and the M-25 (the license built Cyclone). On 14 April 1934, the Cyclone prototype was damaged when one of the landing gear legs collapsed while it was taxiing. The third prototype with a Cyclone engine incorporated a series of aerodynamic improvements and was delivered for government trials on 7 September 1934. The top speed of 437  km/h (270  mph) no longer satisfied the Air Force, who now wanted the experimental Nazarov M-58 engine and 470  km/h (290  mph). Subsequently, the M-22 powered version entered production at Factory 21 in Nizhny Novgorod and Factory 39 in Moscow. Because it was the fourth aircraft produced by these factories, it received the designation I-16 Type 4. Aircraft fitted with these new engines required a slightly changed airframe, including armor plating for the pilot and changes to the landing gear doors to allow for complete closure. The M-25 fitted I-16, the I-16 Type 5, featured a new engine cowling which was slightly smaller in diameter and featured nine forward-facing shuttered openings to control cooling airflow, a redesigned exhaust with eight individual outlet stubs, and other changes. The M-25 was rated at 474  kW (635  hp) at sea level and 522  kW (700  hp) at 2,300  m (7,546  ft). Due to the poor quality of the canopy glazing, the I-16 Type 5 pilots typically left the canopy open or removed the rear portion completely. By the time the Type 5 arrived, it was the world&apos;s lightest production fighter (1,460  kg/3,219  lb), as well as the worlds fastest, able to reach speeds of 454  km/h (282  mph) at altitude and 395  km/h (245  mph) at sea level. While the Type 5 could not perform the high-g maneuvers of other fighters, it possessed superior speed and climb rates, and had extremely responsive aileron control which gave the Type 5 a very good roll rate which lead to precision maneuvers in loops and split-Ss. A total of 7,005 single-seat and 1,639 two-seat trainer variants were produced. [ Operational history ] Initial service experience revealed that the ShKAS machine gun s had a tendency to jam. This was the result of the guns being installed in the wings upside-down to facilitate the fit. The problem was addressed in later modifications. Evaluations from pilots confirmed the experience with prototypes. Controls were light and very sensitive, abrupt maneuvers resulted in spins, and spin behavior was excellent. A barrel roll could be performed in under 1.5 seconds (roll rate over 240  degrees/second). The machine guns were fired via a cable and the required effort, coupled with sensitive controls, made precision aiming difficult. The rear weight bias made I-16 easy to handle on unprepared airfields because the aircraft was rather unlikely to flip over the nose even if the front wheels dug in. The pilots had poor visibility { Jackson 2003 p. 148. } and the canopy tended to become fouled with engine oil and the moving portion was prone to slamming shut during hard maneuvers which caused many pilots to fix it in the open position.The I-16 was a difficult fighter to fly. The front section of the fuselage, with the engine, was too close to the centre of gravity, and the pilot&apos;s cockpit too far to the rear. The Polikarpov had insufficient longitudinal stability and it was impossible to fly the aircraft &quot; hand off &quot;. { Jackson 2003 p. 147. } { Popeye mascot &quot; } [ Spanish Civil War ] At the start of Spanish Civil War in 1936, Republican forces pleaded for fighter aircraft. After receiving payment in gold, Joseph Stalin dispatched around 475 { Gunston 2003 p. 85. } I-16 Type 5s and Type 6s. The first I-16s appeared in Spanish skies in November 1936. { Maslov 2010 p. 25. } The Polikarpov monoplanes had their baptism of fire on the 13 November 1936, when 12 I-16s intercepted a Nationalist bombing raid on Madrid. Soviet pilots claimed four air victories. Two Germans Heinkel He 51 pilots were indeed killed. But the Soviets suffered losses too; the group commander collided with an enemy aircraft and another I-16 pilot crash landed. { Maslov 2010, p. 26. } The Polikarpovs immediately began dominating the enemy He 51s, Arado Ar 68 and Fiat CR.32 biplanes, [ September 2011 ] and remained unchallenged until the introduction of the Messerschmitt Bf 109.The arrival of the newest Bf 109Bs and the overwhelming numerical superiority of Nationalist fighters were the primary cause of the heavy combat losses suffered by I-15s and I-16s throughout 1937. { Maslov 2010 p. 30. } A number of aviation publications called the new Soviet fighter a &quot; Boeing &quot; due to the incorrect assumption that it was based on the Boeing P-26 &apos;s design. The Nationalists nicknamed the stubby fighter Rata (Rat), while the Republicans affectionately called it Mosca (Fly). Combat experience showed that the I-16 had deficiencies; several aircraft were lost after structural failure of the wings which was quickly remedied by reinforced structures. Heavy machine gun bullets could sometimes penetrate the armored backrest and fuel tanks occasionally caught fire in spite of being protected. The hot Spanish summers required the addition of oil radiators, and dust adversely affected the life of the engines. Although some aircraft accumulated up to 400 hours of flying time, the average life of an I-16 was 87 days, of which one sixth was spent on maintenance. The biggest complaint in service was the light armament of only two 7.62  mm (0.30  in) machine gun s. This was urgently addressed with Type 6 which added a third ShKAS in the bottom of the fuselage. The four-gun Type 10 was nicknamed &quot; Super Mosca &quot; or simply &quot; Super &quot;.The total number of I-16s delivered to Spain in 1936-1938 amounted to 276. When the war ended, on 1 April 1939, 187 Ratas had been lost in Spain: 112 lost in combat, one shot down by anti-aircraft fire, 11 destroyed on the ground, one force-landed and 62 lost in accidents. { Maslov 2010 p. 32. } [ The Far East ] I-16 with Chinese insignia, flown by Chinese pilots and Soviet volunteers Another 250 I-16 Type 10 were supplied to China. This model added a second set of 7.62  mm (0.30  in) ShKAS machine guns, armor behind the pilot, and had a slightly upgraded 560  kW (750  hp) M-25 engine. In 1939, these aircraft fought against the Japanese, fighting the fixed-landing gear equipped Nakajima Ki-27 Nate of the IJAAF and IJNAF &apos;s Mitsubishi A5M Claude. Further large scale action took place in fighting between the Soviet Union and Japan in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1939. The next year, the Imperial Japanese Navy introduced the A6M Zero which was more than a match for the I-16. Further attempts were made to upgrade the firepower of the aircraft using 20  mm (0.79  in) ShVAK cannon s, making the I-16 one of the most heavily armed fighters of that moment, { Price 1975, p. 78. } able to fire 28 pounds of ammunition in three seconds. Pilots loved the results, but the cannons were in short supply and only a small number of I-16 Type 12, 17, 27, and 28 were built. The cannons adversely affected performance with the 360° circle time increasing from 15 seconds in Type 5 to 18 seconds. Type 24 replaced the skid with a tailwheel and featured the much more powerful 670  kW (900  hp) Shvetsov M-63 engine. Type 29 replaced two of the ShKAS guns with a single 12.7  mm (.50  in) UBS. Types 18, 24, 27, 28, and 29 could be equipped to carry RS-82 unguided rockets. A 1939 government study found that I-16 had exhausted its performance potential. Addition of armor, radio, battery, and flaps during the aircraft&apos;s evolution exacerbated the rear weight distribution to the point where the aircraft required considerable forward pressure on the stick to maintain level flight and at the same time developed a tendency to enter uncontrolled dives. Extension and retraction of the landing flaps caused a dramatic change in the aircraft attitude. Accurate gunfire was difficult. [ Russia ] { VVS pilots at } { Khalkin Gol in front of their I-16 in August 1939. } The pilots nicknamed the aircraft Ishak (Russian: Ишак, Donkey/ Hinny ) because it was similar to the Russian pronunciation of &quot; I-16 &quot;. When Operation Barbarossa erupted on 22 June 1941, 1,635 of 4,226 VVS aircraft were I-16s of all variants, fielded by 57 fighter regiments in frontier areas. { Maslov 2010 p. 68. } The main assault delivered by Luftwaffe&apos;s Luftflotte 2 (in support of Wehrmacht Army Group Centre) was directed against the Soviet Western Special Military district, that deployed 361 (424, according to other sources) I-16s. { Maslov 2010 pp. 68-69. } During the early phase of the campaign the I-16 bases were main targets for the German aircraft and after 48 hours of combat, of the 1,635 Polikarpov monoplanes in service on 21 June 1941, only 937 were left. { Maslov 2010 p. 69. } By 30 June the number of I-16s of western front line units had dropped to 873, including 99 that required repairs. { Maslov 2010 p. 72. } To stem the Luftwaffe aerial assault several I-16 pilots adopted the taran tactic and sacrificed their lives, ramming German aircraft. { Maslov 2010 p. 72. } Its main opponent in the sky of 1941 was the German Messerschmitt Bf 109. { Drabkin 2007 p. 142. } The I-16 was slightly more maneuverable than the early Bf 109s and could fight the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, or Emil, on equal terms in turns. Skilled Soviet pilots took advantage of Polikarpov&apos;s superior horizontal maneuverability and liked it enough to resist the switch to more modern fighters. The German aircraft, however, outclassed its Russian opponent in service ceiling, rate of climb, acceleration and, crucially, in horizontal and diving speed, due to better aerodynamics and a more powerful engine. The main versions of the I-16 had a maximum speed of 450–470  km/h (279-291  mph), while the Bf 109E had a maximum speed of 560–570  km/h (347-353  mph), the more streamlined Bf 109F Friedrich could hit 600  km/h (372  mph). Superior speed was the decisive factor in a dogfight so German pilots held the initiative and could decide if they wanted to chase their opponents, could attack them from above and behind and then gain altitude for an eventual new attack. Meanwhile Polikarpovs could only defend each other by forming a defensive circle or via horizontal maneuverability. { Drabkin 2007 p. 142. } Moreover, in terms of armament, Messerschmitts had a slight edge on the I-16. The Emil carried two wing-mounted 20  mm MG FF cannons and two synchronized 7.92  mm MG-17s with a weight of a one-second salvo of 2.37  kg, while the most common version of the I-16 - armed with just two synchronized and two wing-mounted 7.62 ShKAS - could deliver 1.43  kg of bullets each second. { Drabkin 2007 pp. 142-143. } Finally, the ammunition storage on a Messerschmitt exceeded that of the I-16, carrying 1,000 bullets for each machine guns (plus 60 rounds for each cannon), while the Polikarpov carried just 450 rounds for each ShKAS gun. { Drabkin 2007 p. 143. } The I-16 and had a more durable engine than the liquid-cooled engine of the Bf 109. Around half of all produced I-16s were still in service in 1943, when they were finally replaced. Specially modified I-16s were used in the Zveno parasite aircraft experiments using the Tupolev TB-3 as mothership. The Luftwaffe was known to have captured some I-16s and UTI-4s two-seat trainers (two of which were marked with the Stammkennzeichen codes DM+HC and DM+HD) and flown from the &apos;&apos;Erprobungstelle Rechlin&apos;&apos; central Luftwaffe test facility by Kampfgeschwader 200 (KG 200). { Thomas 2004, p. 80. } The Luftwaffe was not the only air force able to test its fighters against the I-16; the Japanese captured a few I-16s as well. and the Romanian Air Force also got one when a Soviet pilot defected. { Stapfer 1996, p. 46. } The Finnish Air Force (FAF) captured some I-16s (along with several other Soviet types). During the Winter War and the Continuation War, the Finns captured six I-16s and one I-16UTI. Two of the captured I-16s and I-16UTIs were put back into flying condition and flight tested. { Perttula, Pentti. &quot; FAF in Color. &quot; saunalahti.fi.
