Flights to the then British colony of Hong Kong and the city of Kota Kinabalu and Kuching in East Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo) started the same day. Early route expansion included services to Manila in 1976, and Bangkok in 1977. Three years later, Royal Brunei acquired a Boeing 737-200QC – its third Boeing 737 – enabling it to reach Kuala Lumpur in 1981 and Darwin in 1983. [ From national independence: 1984–1991 ] After the independence of Brunei from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984, services commenced to Jakarta on 3 January, thus linking all five ASEAN capital cities at the time – Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Singapore – to Brunei. Three Boeing 757-200 s were purchased in the mid-1980s to enable the airline to expand to Taipei in 1986 and Dubai in 1988. They were also used on existing high-capacity routes to Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Jakarta and KualaLumpur; after the introduction of the 757, its smaller sibling was phased out. In 1990, Royal Brunei began its first flight to Europe when services started to Frankfurt am Main via Bangkok and Dubai. Services to London Gatwick Airport commenced in 1990 via Singapore and Dubai, and changed to London Heathrow Airport in 1991, by which time services were inaugurated to Perth and to Jeddah via Dubai. [ Rapid expansion: 1992–1996 ] { Boeing 767-300ER at } { Perth Airport. } With the airline&apos;s rapid expansion the 737s were sold, replaced by the Boeing 767.

In March 1993, Abu Dhabi was added to the route network, through which flights to Frankfurt and Jeddah were re-routed instead of Dubai. Bali was the second Indonesian city to be added to the network in May during the year. Flights to the third European destination, Zürich, commenced in August 1993 via Kuala Lumpur and another new destination, Bahrain. Before the end of the year, the airline were inaugurated services to Beijing (October) and Cairo (November), via Kuala Lumpur and Bahrain, respectively. RBA sold its last Boeing 737 to Aloha Airlines. The growth of the network continued in 1994. The delivery of two Fokker 50 s were used to start services to Miri and Labuan in East Malaysia of the same year. Flights to Brisbane and Osaka were also commenced in June and December, respectively; (the Brisbane service was initially routed via Darwin but later upgraded to a non-stop flight ).

The route to Zürich was suspended in September 1996 to enable Royal Brunei to commence daily services to London Heathrow. Some London flights were routed through Yangon and Abu Dhabi, instead of via Singapore and Dubai; however, Yangon proved uneconomical and was discontinued the following year. [ Consolidation: 1997–2002 ] In August 1997, a Dornier 228 owned by Royal Brunei Airlines but operated and maintained by Malaysian regional carrier Hornbill Airways, carrying 19 passengers to Miri, crashed into high ground near Miri airport. All 19 passengers and two crew died. The Dornier 228s were sold in 1997 and short haul services connecting Brunei to Miri, Labuan, Mulu and Bintulu were terminated. Later that year, Surabaya was the fourth Indonesian destination to be added. Unprofitable routes to Beijing and Osaka were suspended in 1998 and the F-100s were also sold to Alpi Eagles Airlines in 1998.

The fleet of 6 Boeing 767 s would be changed to 15 new narrow-body aircraft and 8 wide-body aircraft; half of the new aircraft to be leased and the others to be purchased.

However, before U.S. routes could be planned Royal Tongan went into bankruptcy with huge debts in mid 2004, after less than 6 months of operation. As Royal Tongan was unable to pay the lease fees, and the 757s was repossessed and stored at Auckland International Airport. Starting in March 2004, 4 of Royal Brunei’s Boeing 767s were modified by the introduction of SkyDreamer seats in Business Class to replace the old First Class and Business Class Skyluxe seats. Business Class was renamed as Sky Executive Class and in Economy class each seat was installed with an 8.4  inch TV. Sky Executive Class was subsequently renamed Business Class following poor response from the public. The unprofitable Taipei route was suspended in late 2004. Kuching and Kolkata were dropped on 31 October 2004 due to the rising oil prices, but at the same time, Sydney was added to the route network. Commencing 17 December, flights to Jeddah were routed through Sharjah instead of Abu Dhabi. { Sharjah International Airport Press Release - last retrieved 28 January 2008 } During the year, the airline launched Blue Sky Fares, a low-cost Internet booking facility, offering cheaper economy class fares on selected destinations, to compete with low-cost carrier s in the region, such as AirAsia.
