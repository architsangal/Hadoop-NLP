The college enrolls approximately 1,700 students and has been coeducational since 1971. It offers 33 majors and 4 additional minors, and the student-faculty ratio is 9:1. Famous alumni include Joshua Chamberlain, Henry W. Longfellow, Franklin Pierce and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Brunswick is located on the shores of Casco Bay and the Androscoggin River, 12 miles north of Freeport, Maine, and 28 miles north of Portland, Maine. In addition to its Brunswick campus, Bowdoin also owns a 118-acre (478,000 m²) coastal studies center on Orrs Island [ http://bowdoin.edu/csc/ The Bowdoin Coastal Studies Center Bowdoin.edu 2011-03-01 2011-03-24 ] and a 200-acre (809,000 m²) scientific field station on Kent Island [ http://bowdoin.edu/kent-island/ A description of Kent Island Bowdoin.edu 2011-03-24 ] in the Bay of Fundy. [ History ] [ Founding and 19th Century ] { Fitz Hugh Lane } Bowdoin College was chartered in 1794 by Governor Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, of which Maine was then a district, and was named for former Massachusetts governor James Bowdoin, whose son James Bowdoin III was an early benefactor. At the time of its founding, it was the easternmost college in the United States. It is thought that the Bowdoin seal, created in 1798 by Joseph Callender, was a sun because it was the first college in the United States to see the sunrise. [ http://www.bowdoin.edu/about/history/symbols.shtml Bowdoin Symbols Bowdoin.edu 1909-04-06 2011-03-24 ] In 1806, 13 Harvard graduates opted to accept a Bowdoin degree along with their diploma from Harvard. [ http://www.bowdoin.edu/about/history/traditions.shtml Bowdoin Traditions and History Bowdoin.edu 2011-03-24 ] Bowdoin came into its own in the 1820s, a decade in which Maine became an independent state as a result of the Missouri Compromise and the college graduated a number of its most famous alumni, including future United States President Franklin Pierce, class of 1824, and writers Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, both of whom graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1825. { watercolor, 1845 } Bowdoin&apos;s connections to the Civil War have prompted some to quip that the war &quot; began and ended &quot; in Brunswick. Harriet Beecher Stowe, &quot; the little lady who started this big war, &quot; started writing her influential anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin in Bowdoin&apos;s Appleton Hall while her husband was teaching at the College, and Brigadier General (and Brevet Major General ) Joshua Chamberlain, a Bowdoin alumnus and professor, was responsible for receiving the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in 1865. Chamberlain, a Medal of Honor recipient who later served as governor of Maine, adjutant-general of Maine, and president of Bowdoin, distinguished himself at Gettysburg, where he led the 20th Maine in its valiant defense of Little Round Top. There are other Civil War connections as well: Major General Oliver Otis Howard, class of 1850, led the Freedmen&apos;s Bureau after the war and later founded Howard University; Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew, class of 1837, was responsible for the formation of the famous 54th Massachusetts; and William P. Fessenden 1823 and Hugh McCulloch 1827 both served as Secretary of the Treasury during the Lincoln Administration. After the war, Bowdoin contended that a higher percentage of its alumni fought in the war than that of any other college in the North—and not only for the Union. In fact, Confederate President Jefferson Davis held an honorary degree from Bowdoin, which he received while United States Secretary of War in 1858. President Ulysses S. Grant, too, was given an honorary degree from the college in 1865. In addition to Howard and Chamberlain, William Fessenden&apos;s sons, James Deering Fessenden and Francis Fessenden, were both brigadier generals, and seventeen Bowdoin alumni would receive brevets as brigadier generals, including Ellis Spear (Class of 1858, who was Chamberlain&apos;s second-in-command at Gettysburg), Charles Hamlin (Class of 1857, son of Vice President Hannibal Hamlin ), and General Howard&apos;s brother Charles (Class of 1859). [ Twentieth century ] Bowdoin was also the Medical School of Maine from 1821-1921 Although Bowdoin&apos;s Medical School of Maine closed its doors in 1921, the College is currently known for its particularly strong programs in the natural sciences. One illustrious alumnus was Dr. Augustus Stinchfield, who received his M.D. in 1868, who went on to become one of the co-founders of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He was asked to join the two Mayo brother&apos;s private medical practice in 1892. In 1915, the remaining partners in the then private practice embraced the creation of the non-profit Mayo Clinic. While perhaps Bowdoin&apos;s better-known alumnus in the sciences is the controversial entomologist-turned-sexologist Alfred Kinsey, class of 1916, the College&apos;s reputation in this area was cemented in large part by the Arctic explorations of Admiral Robert E. Peary, class of 1877, and Donald B. MacMillan, class of 1898. View of the campus from Coles Tower (constructed as the &quot; Senior Center &quot; ), the second tallest building in Maine Peary led the first successful expedition to the North Pole in 1908, and MacMillan, a member of Peary&apos;s crew, became famous in his own right as he explored Greenland, Baffin Island and Labrador in the schooner Bowdoin between 1908 and 1954. Bowdoin&apos;s Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum [ http://academic.bowdoin.edu/arcticmuseum/ Website of the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum Academic.bowdoin.edu 2010-11-18 2011-03-24 ] honors the two explorers, and the College&apos;s mascot, the Polar Bear, was chosen in 1913 to honor MacMillan, who donated a particularly large specimen to his alma mater in 1917. Following in the footsteps of President Pierce and House Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed, class of 1860, several 20th century Bowdoin graduates have assumed prominent positions in national government while representing the Pine Tree State. Wallace H. White, Jr., class of 1899, served as Senate Minority Leader from 1944–1947 and Senate Majority Leader from 1947–1949; George J. Mitchell, class of 1954, served as Senate Majority Leader from 1989-1995 before assuming a prominent role in the Northern Ireland peace process; and William Cohen, class of 1962, spent twenty-five years in the House and Senate before being appointed Secretary of Defense in the Clinton Administration. Maine&apos;s First Congressional District has been christened the &quot; Bowdoin seat &quot; because of its long occupation by graduates of the College. A total of eleven Bowdoin graduates have ascended to the Maine governorship, and three graduates of the College currently sit on the state&apos;s highest court. Over the last several decades, Bowdoin College has modernized dramatically. In 1970, it became one of a very limited number of selective schools to make the SAT optional in the admissions process, and in 1971, after nearly 180 years as a small men&apos;s college, Bowdoin admitted its first class of women. Bowdoin also phased out fraternities in the late 1990s, replacing them with a system of college-owned social houses. [ Recent developments ] { Bowdoin College Museum of Art (built in 1894), completed in 2007 } In 2001, Barry Mills, class of 1972, was appointed as the fifth alumnus president of the College. On January 18, 2008, Bowdoin announced that it would be eliminating loans for all new and current students receiving financial aid, replacing those loans with grants beginning with the 2008-2009 academic year. [ Story posted January 24, 2008 http://www.bowdoin.edu/news/archives/1bowdoincampus/004745.shtml Bowdoin Eliminates Student Loans While Vowing to Maintain its Com, Campus News (Bowdoin) Bowdoin.edu 2008-01-24 2011-03-24 ] President Mills stated, &quot; Some see a calling in such vital but often low paying fields such as teaching or social work. With significant debt at graduation, some students will undoubtedly be forced to make career or education choices not on the basis of their talents, interests, and promise in a particular field, but rather on their capacity to repay student loans. As an institution devoted to the common good, Bowdoin must consider the fairness of such a result. &quot; In February 2009, following a $10 million donation by Subway Sandwiches co-founder and alumnus Peter Buck, the college completed a $250-million capital campaign. Additionally, the college has also recently completed major construction projects on the campus, including a significant renovation of the college&apos;s art museum and a new fitness center named after Peter Buck.

Other departments are also strong, including economics, the natural sciences, and English. In 2010, Bowdoin&apos;s art history program was ranked as the top program in the nation by U.S. News and World Report. Course distribution requirements were abolished in the 1970s, but were reinstated by a faculty majority vote in 1981, as a result of an initiative by oral communication and film professor Barbara Kaster. She insisted that distribution requirements would ensure students a more well-rounded education in a diversity of fields and therefore present them with more career possibilities. The requirements of at least two courses in each of the categories of Natural Sciences / Mathematics, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Humanities / Fine Arts, and Foreign Studies (including languages) took effect for the Class of 1987 and have been gradually amended since then. Current requirements require one course each in: Natural Sciences, Quantitive Reasoning, Visual and Performing Arts, International Perspectives and Exploring Social Differences. A small, writing intensive course, called a First Year Seminar, is also required. In 2002, the faculty decided to change the grading system so that it incorporated plus and minus grades. Previously, only grades of A, B, C, D, and F, were given, without the &quot; + &quot; or &quot; - &quot; modifications. Other prominent Bowdoin faculty include (or have included): Edville Gerhardt Abbott, Charles Beitz, John Bisbee, Paul Chadbourne, Thomas Cornell, Kristen R. Ghodsee, Eddie Glaude, Joseph E. Johnson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Elliott Schwartz, and Scott Sehon.

Bowdoin is a need-blind and a no-loans institution. Students applying to the school are evaluated independently of their financial situations, the college meets 100% of demonstrated financial need, and the college replaces loans with grants for all students on financial aid to lift the burden of significant student debt upon graduation. While a significant portion of the student body hails from New England — including nearly 25% from Massachusetts and 10% from Maine — recent classes have drawn from an increasingly national and international pool. Although Bowdoin once had a reputation for homogeneity (both ethnically and socioeconomically), a diversity campaign has increased the percentage of students of color in recent classes to more than 31%. { http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?match=true &amp; collegeId=3744 &amp; searchType=college &amp; type=qfs &amp; word=bowdoin%20college } In fact, admission of minorities goes back at least as far as John Brown Russwurm 1826, Bowdoin&apos;s first African-American college graduate, and the third African-American graduate of any American college. { Charles C.

Morgan &apos;59 described student life at the then-all-male school as &quot; monastic, &quot; and noted that &quot; the only things to do were either work or drink. &quot; (This is corroborated by the Official Preppy Handbook, which in 1980 ranked Bowdoin the number two drinking school in the country, behind Dartmouth.)

While six houses were originally established, following the construction of two new dorms, two were added effective in the fall of 2007, bringing the total to eight: Ladd (affiliated with Osher Hall), Baxter (West), Quinby (Appleton), MacMillan (Coleman), Howell (Hyde), Helmreich (Maine), Reed (Moore), and Burnett (Winthrop). The college houses are physical buildings around campus which host parties and other events throughout the year. Those students who choose not to live in their affiliated house retain their affiliation and are considered members throughout their Bowdoin career. Before the fraternity system was abolished in the 1990s, all the Bowdoin fraternities were co-educational (except for one unrecognized sorority and two unrecognized all-male fraternities).
