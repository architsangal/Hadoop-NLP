{ U.S patent } A patent ( [ icon ˈ p æ t ən t ] or [ ˈ p eɪ t ən t ] ) is a form of intellectual property. It consists of a set of exclusive right s granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or their assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for the public disclosure of an invention. The procedure for granting patents, the requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claim s defining the invention which must meet the relevant patentability requirements such as novelty and non-obviousness. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or distributing the patented invention without permission. [ http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html#protection Patents: Frequently Asked Questions World Intellectual Property Organization 22 February 2009 ] Under the World Trade Organization &apos;s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, { Article 27.1. of the TRIPs Agreement. } and the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years. In many countries, certain subject areas are excluded from patents, such as business methods and computer programs. [ Definition ] The word patent originates from the Latin patere, which means &quot; to lay open &quot; (i.e., to make available for public inspection). More directly, it is a shortened version of the term letters patent, which was a royal decree granting exclusive rights to a person, predating the modern patent system. Similar grants included land patent s, which were land grants by early state governments in the USA, and printing patent s, a precursor of modern copyright. In modern usage, the term patent usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents any new, useful, and non-obvious process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter. Some other types of intellectual property rights are also referred to as patents in some jurisdictions: industrial design rights are called design patents in the US, plant breeders&apos; rights are sometimes called plant patents, and utility model s and Gebrauchsmuster are sometimes called petty patents or innovation patents. The additional qualification utility patent is sometimes used (primarily in the US) to distinguish the primary meaning from these other types of patents. Examples of particular species of patents for inventions include biological patent s, business method patent s, chemical patent s and software patent s.

[ History of Copyright UK Intellectual Property Office 2006 http://www.patent.gov.uk/about-history-copy.htm 2007-08-12 ] The patent systems in many other countries, including Australia, are based on British law and can be traced back to the Statute of Monopolies. { State of Victoria Library: Patent Resources } In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court for a new process for making salt. { James W.

Actual use of the invention was deemed adequate disclosure to the public. { Frank D. Prager, “Proposals for the Patent Act of 1790 &quot;, Journal of the Patent and Trademark Office Society, March 1954, vol XXXVI, No. 3, pp 157 et Seq., citing J. Isore in Revue Historique de Droit Francais, 1937 pp. 117 et Seq. } The modern French patent system was created during the Revolution in 1791. Patents were granted without examination since inventor&apos;s right was considered as a natural one { Gabriel Galvez-Behar, La République des inventeurs. Propriété et organisation de l&apos;innovation en France, 1791-1922, Presses universitaires de Rennes, 2008, ISBN 2-7535-0695-7, ISBN 978-2-7535-0695-4. } In the United States, during the so-called colonial period and Articles of Confederation years (1778–89), several states adopted patent systems of their own. The first Congress adopted a Patent Act, in 1790, and the first patent was issued under this Act on July 31, 1790 (to Samuel Hopkins of Vermont for a potash production technique). [ Law ] [ Effects ] A patent is not a right to practice or use the invention. { &quot; A patent is not the grant of a right to make or use or sell. It does not, directly or indirectly, imply any such right. It grants only the right to exclude others. The supposition that a right to make is created by the patent grant is obviously inconsistent with the established distinctions between generic and specific patents, and with the well-known fact that a very considerable portion of the patents granted are in a field covered by a former relatively generic or basic patent, are tributary to such earlier patent, and cannot be practiced unless by license thereunder. &quot; - Herman v. Youngstown Car Mfg. Co., 191 F. 579, 584-85, 112 CCA 185 (6th Cir. 1911) } Rather, a patent provides the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention for the term of the patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date { Article 33 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( } { TRIPS ). } subject to the payment of maintenance fees. A patent is, in effect, a limited property right that the government offers to inventors in exchange for their agreement to share the details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned. The rights conveyed by a patent vary country-by-country. For example, in the United States, a patent covers research, except &quot; purely philosophical &quot; inquiry. A U.S. patent is infringed by any &quot; making &quot; of the invention, even a making that goes toward development of a new invention—which may itself become subject of a patent. A patent being an exclusionary right does not, however, necessarily give the owner of the patent the right to exploit the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else&apos;s patent. If an inventor takes an existing, patented mouse trap design, adds a new feature to make an improved mouse trap, and obtains a patent on the improvement, he or she can only legally build his or her improved mouse trap with permission from the patent holder of the original mouse trap, assuming the original patent is still in force. On the other hand, the owner of the improved mouse trap patent can exclude the original patent owner from using the improvement. Some countries have &quot; working provisions &quot; that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers. Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention. The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention. [ Enforcement ] Patents can generally only be enforced through civil lawsuit s (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as France and Austria ) have criminal penalties for wanton infringement. [ DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary 2005 Patent Litigation across Europe http://cecollect.com/ve/ZZf3096aBBft91T940 cecollect.com DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary ] Typically, the patent owner will seek monetary compensation for past infringement, and will seek an injunction prohibiting the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement. To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practices all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the &quot; doctrine of equivalents &quot; ). An important limitation on the ability of a patent owner to successfully assert the patent in civil litigation is the accused infringer&apos;s right to challenge the validity of that patent. Civil courts hearing patent cases can and often do declare patents not valid. A patent can be found invalid on grounds that are set out in the relevant patent legislation that vary between countries. Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for patentability in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a prior publication, for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated. An example is the UK Certificate of contested validity. Patent licensing agreements are contract s in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to forgo their right to sue the licensee for infringement of the licensor&apos;s patent rights, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation. It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into dozens of license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under cross-licensing agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other&apos;s patented inventions. Therefore, patents may be enforced through litigation, and a common defense is an invalidity challenge. Patents may also be subject to licensing agreements. The vast majority of patents are however never litigated or even licensed. { Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001). Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 95, No. 4, 2001. Available at or doi:10.2139/ssrn.261400 SSRN.com } [ Ownership ] In most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent. In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be assigned to a corporate entity subsequently [ Assignee (Company) Name http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week39/OG/help/help.htm#Assignee%20%28Company%29%20Name Help Page U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) 2007-07-25 ] and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under a contract of employment. In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor&apos;s normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer&apos;s company. { See Section 39 of the UK Patents Act as an example. The laws across Europe vary from country to country but are generally harmonised. } { ejector seat of a military aircraft, stating that the design is covered by multiple patents in Britain, South Africa, Canada and &quot; others &quot;. } { Dübendorf Museum of Military Aviation. } The inventors, their successors or their assignees become the proprietors of the patent when and if it is granted. If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent. For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s). The ability to assign ownership rights increases the liquidity of a patent as property. Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties. { Article 28.2 TRIPs : &quot; Patent owners shall also have the right to assign, or transfer by succession, the patent and to conclude licensing contracts. &quot;. } The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves. [ Governing laws ] [ Patent law by countries and regions ] The grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws. Patents are, therefore, territorial in nature. Commonly, a nation forms a patent office with responsibility for operating that nation&apos;s patent system, within the relevant patent laws. The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts. There is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) being particularly active in this area. The TRIPs Agreement has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws. Conformity with the TRIPs agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important. This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice. A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority : filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Because the right to a patent is intensely date-driven, this right is fundamental to modern patent usage. [ April 2012 ] The authority for patent statutes in different countries varies. In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended. { United Kingdom law requiring no explicit authority due to the } { Supremacy of Parliament. } In the United States, the Constitution empowers Congress to make laws to &quot; promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts... &quot; The laws Congress passed are codified in Title 35 of the United States Code and created the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) [administered by the European Patent Organisation (EPOrg)], and the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) (administered by WIPO and covering more than 140 countries), that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization. [ Application and prosecution ] [ Patent application Patent prosecution ] A patent is requested by filing a written application at the relevant patent office. The person or company filing the application is referred to as &quot; the applicant &quot;. The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee. The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide sufficient detail for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention. In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the best mode of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention. Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided. The application also includes one or more claims, although it is not always a requirement to submit these when first filing the application. The claims set out what the applicant is seeking to protect in that they define what the patent owner has a right to exclude others from making, using, or selling, as the case may be. In other words, the claims define what a patent covers or the &quot; scope of protection &quot;. After filing, an application is often referred to as &quot; patent pending &quot;. While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages. { IP Australia website, &apos;&apos;What does &apos;patent pending&apos; mean?&apos;&apos;, Consulted on August 5, 2009. } { USPTO web site, &apos;&apos;Patent Marking and &quot; Patent Pending &quot; &apos;&apos; (Excerpted from General Information Concerning Patents print brochure), Consulted on August 5, 2009. } { UK Intellectual Property Office web site, &apos;&apos;Display your rights&apos;&apos;, (under &quot; IPO Home &gt; Types of IP &gt; Patents &gt; Managing your patents &gt; Using and enforcing &quot; ) Consulted on August 5, 2009. } For a patent to be granted, that is to take legal effect in a particular country, the patent application must meet the patentability requirements of that country. Most patent offices examine the application for compliance with these requirements. If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their patent agent or attorney and one or more opportunities to respond to the objections to bring the application into compliance are usually provided. Once granted the patent is subject in most countries to renewal fees to keep the patent in force. These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis, although the US is a notable exception. Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g. the European Patent Office ) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted. [ Costs ] The costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent. The European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10 year term was around 32,000 Euro. { With the following assumptions: &quot; 18 pages (11 pages description, 3 pages claims, 4 pages drawings), 10 claims, patent validated in 6 countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland), excl. in-house preparation costs for the patentee &quot; (the costs relate to European patents granted in 2002/2003), in European Patent Office, &apos;&apos;The cost of a sample European patent - new estimates&apos;&apos;, 2005, p.  1. } Since the London Agreement entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required. In the United States, in 2000 cost of obtaining patent ( patent prosecution ) was estimated from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent. When patent litigation is involved (which in year 1999 happened in about 1,600 cases compared to 153,000 patents issued in the same year ), costs increase significantly: while 95% of patent litigation cases are settled out of court, { Carry a Big Stick } but when the case reaches the court, direct legal costs of patent litigation are on average in the order of a million dollars per case, not including associated business costs. [ Patent failure: how judges, bureaucrats, and lawyers put innovators at risk Bessen James Meurer Michael James 2008 132 0-691-13491-X ] {. Based on an } { American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) survey of patent lawyers (2005), and court documents for a sample of 89 court cases where one side was ordered to pay the other side&apos;s legal fees.The containing chapter (‘The Costs of Disputes’) also tries to quantify associated business costs. } [ Alternatives to applying for a patent ] A defensive publication is the act of publishing a detailed description of a new invention without patenting it, so as to establish prior art and public identification as the creator/originator of an invention, although a defensive publication can also be anonymous. A defensive publication prevents others from later being able to patent the invention. A trade secret is the act of not disclosing the methods by which a complex invention works or how a chemical is formulated. Trade secrets are protected by nondisclosure agreements and employment law that prevents reverse engineering and information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and corporate espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not limited in time (it &quot; continues indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public &quot;, [ http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid Friedrich Klinkert April 2012 MIPLC Lecture Series May 6, 2012 6 ] whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention), a trade secret does not imply any registration costs, has an immediate effect, does not require compliance with any formalities, and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public. The disadvantages of trade secrets include that &quot; others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it &quot;, [ http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid Friedrich Klinkert April 2012 MIPLC Lecture Series May 6, 2012 7 ] &quot; others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets &quot;, and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent. [ Economics ] [ Economics and patents ] [ Rationale ] There are four primary incentives embodied in the patent system: to invent in the first place; to disclose the invention once made; to invest the sums necessary to experiment, produce and market the invention; and to design around and improve upon earlier patents. [ April 2010 ] [ March 2009 ] [ February 2011 ] [ March 2009 ] [ March 2009 ] Patents provide incentives for economically efficient research and development (R &amp; D). A study conducted annually by the IPTS shows that the 2,000 largest global companies invested more than 430 billion euros in 2008 The 2009 EU Industrial R &amp; D Investment Scoreboard produced by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies in their R &amp; D departments. If the investments can be considered as inputs of R &amp; D, real products and patents are the outputs. Based on these groups, a project named Corporate Invention Board, had measured and analyzed the patent portfolios to produce an original picture Technological profiles for global companies by analysing their patent portfolios of their technological profiles. Supporters of patents argue that without patent protection, R &amp; D spending would be significantly less or eliminated altogether, limiting the possibility of technological advances or breakthroughs. Corporations would be much more conservative about the R &amp; D investments they made, as third parties would be free to exploit any developments. This second justification is closely related to the basic ideas underlying traditional property rights. Howard T. Markey (chief judge of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and later of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit), Special Problems in Patent Cases, 66 F.R.D. 529, 1975. In accordance with the original definition of the term &quot; patent, &quot; patents facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation s into the public domain for the common good. If inventor s did not have the legal protection of patents, in many cases, they would prefer or tend to keep their inventions secret. Awarding patents generally makes the details of new technology publicly available, for exploitation by anyone after the patent expires, or for further improvement by other inventors. Furthermore, when a patent&apos;s term has expired, the public record ensures that the patentee&apos;s idea is not lost to humanity. In many industries (especially those with high fixed cost s and either low marginal cost s or low reverse engineering costs — computer processors, and pharmaceuticals for example), once an invention exists, the cost of commercialization (testing, tooling up a factory, developing a market, etc.) is far more than the initial conception cost. (For example, the internal &quot; rule of thumb &quot; at several computer companies in the 1980s was that post-R &amp; D costs were 7-to-1). Unless there is some way to prevent copies from competing at the marginal cost of production, companies will not make that productization investment. One effect of modern patent usage is that a small-time inventor can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor. This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention. Thus the inventor&apos;s time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on manufacturability. { Stim, Rishand, &quot; Profit from Your Idea: How to Make Smart Licensing Decisions &quot;, ISBN 1-4133-0450-8 (Published 2006) } Another effect of modern patent usage is to cause competitors to design around (or to &quot; invent around &quot; according to R S Praveen Raj ) { Thehindubusinessline.com } each other&apos;s patents. This may promote healthy competition among manufacturers, resulting in gradual improvements of the technology base. [ Kim Linsui Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property Rights: Lessons from Korea&apos;s Experience UNCTAD/ICTSD 2002 UNCTAD/ICTSD Working Paper ] This may help augment national economies and confer better living standards to the citizens. The 1970 Indian Patent Act allowed the Indian pharmaceutical industry to develop local technological capabilities in this industry. This act transformed India from a bulk importer of pharmaceutical drugs to a leading exporter. The rapid evolution of Indian pharmaceutical industry since the mid-1970s highlights the fact that the design of the patent act was instrumental in building local capabilities even in a poor country like India. [ Kumar Nagesh Intellectual Property Rights, Technology, and Economic Development: Experience of East Asian Countries RIS Discussion Paper 2002 25 ] [ Criticism ] [ Criticism of patents ] As state-granted monopolies, patents have been criticized as inconsistent with free trade. On that basis, in 1869 the Netherlands abolished patents, and did not reintroduce them until 1912. { Chang, Ha-Joon. &quot; Kicking Away the Ladder: How the Economic and Intellectual Histories of Capitalism Have Been Re-Written to Justify Neo-Liberal Capitalism &quot;. } { Post-Autistic Economics Review. 4 September 2002: Issue 15, Article 3. Retrieved on 8 October 2008. } Patents have also been criticized for being granted on already-known inventions, with many complaining in the United States that the USPTO fails &quot; to do a serious job of examining patents, thus allowing bad patents to slip through the system. &quot; On the other hand, it has been argued that because of low number of patents going into litigation, increasing quality of patents at patent prosecution stage will increase overall legal costs associated with patents, and that current USPTO policy is a reasonable compromise between full trial on examination stage on one hand, and pure registration without examination, on the other hand. Patent trolls are one of common criticisms against patents, { TROLL OR NO TROLL? POLICING PATENT USAGE WITH AN OPEN POST-GRANT REVIEW } though some commentators suggest that patent trolls are not bad for the patent system at all but instead realign market participant incentives, make patents more liquid, and clear the patent market.

[ Ferreira L. 2002 Access to Affordable HIV/AIDS Drugs: The Human Rights Obligations of Multinational Pharmaceutical Corporations Fordham Law Review 71 3 1133–79 12523370 ] Critics also question the rationale that exclusive patent rights and the resulting high prices are required for pharmaceutical companies to recoup the large investments needed for research and development. One study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development. [ Barton J.H.

Other groups are investigating how social inclusion and equitable distribution of research and development findings can be obtained within the existing intellectual property framework, although these efforts have received less exposure. Some public campaigns have expressed a concern for &quot; preventing the over-reach &quot; of IP protection including patent protection, and &quot; to retain a public balance in property rights &quot; of this kind. { Susan K Sell (2003), Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights, Cambridge, 2003 (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge Studies in International Relations: 88); quoted from page 179, see also page 5. } According to James Bessen, the costs of patent litigation exceed their investment value in all industries except chemistry and pharmaceuticals. For example, in the software industry, litigation costs are twice the investment value. { Bessen, James, 2008. &quot; The value of U.S. patents by owner and patent characteristics, &quot; Research Policy, Elsevier, vol. 37(5), pages 932-945, June. } [ Proposed alternatives to the patent system ] According to James Bessen, elimination of the patent system would increase the incentives for innovation in all industries except Chemistry and pharmaceuticals by eliminating startup litigation costs. { Bessen, James, 2008. &quot; The value of U.S. patents by owner and patent characteristics, &quot; Research Policy, Elsevier, vol. 37(5), pages 932-945, June. } Alternatives have been discussed to address the issue of financial incentivization to replace patents. Mostly, they are related to some form of direct or indirect government funding. One example is the idea of providing &quot; prize money &quot; (from a &quot; prize fund &quot; sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent. { Stiglitz, Joseph. Project Syndicate, 2007. project-syndicate.org } Another approach is to remove the issue of financing development from the private sphere all together, and to cover the costs with direct government funding. { Baker, Dean. “The Reform of Intellectual Property”. post-autistic economics review, issue no. 32, 5 July 2005, article 1, Paecon.net } Trade secrets are an existing alternative to the patent system. Given their popularity, it has been proposed [ April 2012 ] to strengthen nondisclosure and employment law pertaining to trade secrets.
