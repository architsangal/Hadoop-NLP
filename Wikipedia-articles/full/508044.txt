The film is based upon the novel Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square by Arthur La Bern, and was adapted for the screen by Anthony Shaffer. La Bern later expressed his dissatisfaction with Shaffer&apos;s adaptation. { Letters to the Editor: Hitchcock&apos;s &quot; Frenzy &quot;, The Times, 29th May 1972 } The film stars Jon Finch, Alec McCowen, and Barry Foster and features Billie Whitelaw, Anna Massey, Barbara Leigh-Hunt, Bernard Cribbins and Vivien Merchant. The original music score was composed by Ron Goodwin. The film was screened at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.

The film has a couple of grisly key scenes. The rape and murder of Brenda ( Barbara Leigh-Hunt ) makes use of numerous short edits in a similar fashion to the Janet Leigh shower scene in Psycho, and this serves to heighten the images of violence and horror. The murder of Brenda is the only murder depicted onscreen. Screenwriter Shaffer convinced Hitchcock that to show a second murder would be redundant. The murder of the barmaid Barbara Jane &quot; Babs &quot; Milligan occurs off-screen. The audience sees her entering the killer&apos;s apartment and then the camera is pulled back down the stairs and all the way out into the street, where the everyday street sounds tell us that she will never hear them again. The audience next sees the killer carrying a large sack and placing it onto the back of a lorry where it sits unobtrusively among a load of unsold potatoes ready to be transported back to Lincolnshire. He soon finds that his lapel pin is missing, and realizes that Babs must have torn it off as he was strangling her. He returns to the lorry and climbs into it to retrieve the pin from Babs&apos; dead fingers, only to find the lorry starting off on its journey north. The killer desperately scrabbles through the sack of potatoes to find the dead woman&apos;s hand. As rigor mortis has set in, he is unable to prise the pin from her grasp until he has broken her fingers. As in several other previous Hitchcock films, the audience is fully aware of the identity of the killer (Bob Rusk, played by Barry Foster ) very early in the proceedings, and is also shown how circumstantial guilt is rapidly built up around an innocent man (Richard Blaney, Babs&apos; boyfriend and Brenda&apos;s ex-husband, played by Jon Finch ). Blaney is duly apprehended by the police and jailed, all the while maintaining his innocence. The investigating detective reconsiders the previous events and begins to believe that he has arrested the wrong man. In several scenes showing the detective&apos;s domestic situation, comedy is used to heighten the grisly nature of the death scenes. The detective and his wife discuss the case over a series of elaborate and seemingly inedible dinners. In counterpoint to Rusk&apos;s violence against women, Detective Oxford is also being driven crazy, but he is a civilized man. Blaney escapes from prison, and the detective knows that he will head to Rusk&apos;s flat at Covent Garden to get revenge on Rusk, and so immediately goes there. Blaney has already arrived to find that the door to Rusk&apos;s flat is unlocked. He silently creeps in and sees what he presumes to be the top of Rusk&apos;s head, asleep in bed; he strikes the body with a metal bar. Just then the audience is shown the truth: it is not Rusk in bed, but another of his victims. Suddenly the detective bursts through the door while Blaney is still standing over the corpse holding the metal bar. Blaney protests his innocence to the detective but the expression on the policeman&apos;s face is clearly one of doubt; just then they both hear Rusk carrying something large and heavy up the staircase. The detective then realises Blaney is innocent and the two men wait in the flat for the killer. When Rusk arrives, he has a large trunk with him, to carry away the dead body, and with the body lying in the bed, his guilt is finally obvious. The film ends with Chief Inspector Oxford&apos;s line, &quot; Mr. Rusk, you&apos;re not wearing your tie &quot;. [ Cast ] Jon Finch as Richard Ian &apos;Dick&apos; Blaney Alec McCowen as Chief Inspector Oxford Barry Foster as Robert &apos;Bob&apos; Rusk Billie Whitelaw as Hetty Porter Anna Massey as Barbara Jane &apos;Babs&apos; Milligan Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Brenda Margaret Blaney Bernard Cribbins as Felix Forsythe Vivien Merchant as Mrs. Oxford Michael Bates as Sergeant Spearman Jean Marsh as Monica Barling Clive Swift as Johnny Porter Madge Ryan as Mrs. Davison Elsie Randolph as Gladys Gerald Sim as Mr. Usher, Solicitor in the Pub John Boxer as Sir George George Tovey as Neville Salt Jimmy Gardner as Hotel Porter Noel Johnson as Doctor in Pub Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s cameo appearance can be seen (three minutes into the film) in the center of a crowd scene wearing a bowler hat. Teaser trailer s show a Hitchcock-like dummy floating in the River Thames and Hitchcock introducing the audience to Covent Garden via the fourth wall. Michael Caine was Hitchcock&apos;s first choice for the role of Rusk, the main antagonist, but Caine thought the character was disgusting and said &quot; I don&apos;t want to be associated with the part &quot;. Foster was cast after Hitchcock saw him in Twisted Nerve (which also featured Frenzy co-star Billie Whitelaw ). Vanessa Redgrave reportedly turned down the role of Brenda, and Deep Red &apos;s David Hemmings (who had co-starred with Redgrave in Blow-Up ) was considered to play Blaney. [ Soundtrack ] Henry Mancini was originally hired as the film&apos;s composer. His opening theme was written in Bachian organ andante, opening in D minor, for organ and an orchestra of strings and brasss to express the formality of the grey London Landmarks, but Hitchcock thought it sounded too much like Herrmann. According to Mancini himself &quot; Hitchcock came to the reccording session, listened awhile and said &quot; Look, If I want Herrmann, I&apos;d ask for Herrman &quot;. After an enigmatic behind-the-scenes melodrama the composer was fired. He never understood the experience, insinting that his score sounded nothing like Herrman. In those days, Mancini had full music measurements sheet and he had to pay all transportation and accommodations himself. In his authobiography Mancini reports that the discussions between himself and Hitchcock seemed clear, he thought he understood what was wanted, but he was replaced and flew back home to Hollywood. The irony was that Mancini was now being second-guessed for being too dark, too shymphonic after having been criticized for being too light before. The Frenzy debacle was a painful topic for years to come. Hitchcock then hired composer Ron Goodwin to write the score after being impressed with some of his earlier work. Goodwin&apos;s music had a lighter tone in the opening scenes, and scenes featuring London scenery, while there were more darker undertones in certain scenes. [ Production ] [ January 2010 ] After a pair of unsuccessful films depicting political intrigue and espionage, Hitchcock returned to the murder genre with this film. The narrative makes use of the familiar Hitchcock theme of an innocent man overwhelmed by circumstantial evidence and wrongly assumed to be guilty. Some critics consider Frenzy the last great Hitchcock film and a return to form after his two previous works, Topaz and Torn Curtain. Hitchcock set and filmed Frenzy in London after many years making films in the United States. The film opens with a sweeping shot along the Thames to Tower Bridge, and while the interior scenes were filmed at Pinewood Studios, much of the location filming was done in and around Covent Garden and was a homage to the London of Hitchcock&apos;s childhood. The son of a Covent Garden merchant, Hitchcock filmed several key scenes showing the area as the working produce market that it was. Aware that the area&apos;s days as a market were numbered, Hitchcock wanted to record the area as he remembered it. According to the making-of feature on the DVD, an elderly man who remembered Hitchcock&apos;s father as a dealer in the vegetable market came to visit the set during the filming and was treated to lunch by the director. During shooting for the film Hitchcock&apos;s wife and long time collaborator Alma had a stroke. As a result some sequences were shot without Hitchcock on the set so he could attend to his wife. { McGilligan, Patrick Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light, published by Regan Books (30/Sep/2003) } The area as seen in the film still exists, but the market no longer operates from there, having relocated in 1974. The buildings seen in the film are now occupied by banks and legal offices, restaurants and nightclubs, such as Henrietta Street, where Rusk lived (and Babs met her untimely demise). Oxford Street, which had the back alley (Dryden Chambers, now demolished) leading to Brenda Blaney&apos;s matrimonial agency, is the busiest shopping area in Britain. Nell of Old Drury, which is the public house where the doctor and solicitor had their frank, plot-assisting discussion on sex killers, is still a thriving bar. The lanes where merchants and workers once carried their produce, as seen in the film, are now occupied by tourists and street performers. Frenzy shows a London that has all but disappeared.
