At its peak in 1923, the organization claimed some 100,000 members in good standing and could marshal the support of perhaps 300,000 workers. Its membership declined dramatically after severe government repression as part of the first Red Scare and a 1924 split brought on by internal conflict. IWW membership does not require that one work in a represented workplace, { &quot; (1) I am a student, a retired worker, and/or I am unemployed; can I still be an IWW member? &quot; } nor does it exclude membership in another labor union. { &quot; (2) I am a member of another union; can I still I join the IWW? &quot; } The IWW contends that all workers should be united as a class and that the wage system should be abolished.

[ Brissenden Paul Frederick The I. W. W.: a study of American syndicalism http://books.google.com/books?id%3D4QkAAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA67 2 November 2011 1919 Columbia University 67 ] It is considered one of the most important events in the history of industrial unionism. The IWW&apos;s first organizers included William D. ( &quot; Big Bill &quot; ) Haywood, Daniel De Leon, Eugene V. Debs, Thomas J Hagerty, Lucy Parsons, &quot; Mother &quot; Mary Harris Jones, Frank Bohn, William Trautmann, Vincent Saint John, Ralph Chaplin, and many others. The IWW&apos;s goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class; its motto was &quot; an injury to one is an injury to all &quot;, which improved upon the 19th century Knights of Labor &apos;s creed, &quot; an injury to one is the concern of all. &quot; In particular, the IWW was organized because of the belief among many unionists, socialists, anarchists and radicals that the AFL not only had failed to effectively organize the U.S. working class, as only about 5% of all workers belonged to unions in 1905, but also was organizing according to narrow craft principles which divided groups of workers. The Wobblies believed that all workers should organize as a class, a philosophy which is still reflected in the Preamble to the current IWW Constitution: The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth. We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers. These conditions can be changed and the interest of the working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to all. Instead of the conservative motto, &quot; A fair day&apos;s wage for a fair day&apos;s work, &quot; we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, &quot; Abolition of the wage system. &quot; It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only for everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old. { Preamble to the IWW Constitution: Iww.org, Retrieved 2010-11-30. } The first IWW charter in Canada, Vancouver Industrial Mixed Union no.322, May 5, 1906. The Wobblies differed from other union movements of the time by its promotion of industrial unionism, as opposed to the craft unionism of the American Federation of Labor. The IWW emphasized rank-and-file organization, as opposed to empowering leaders who would bargain with employers on behalf of workers. This manifested itself in the early IWW&apos;s consistent refusal to sign contracts, which they felt would restrict workers&apos; abilities to aid each other when called upon. Though never developed in any detail, Wobblies envisioned the general strike as the means by which the wage system would be overthrown and a new economic system ushered in, one which emphasized people over profit, cooperation over competition. One of the IWW&apos;s most important contributions to the labor movement and broader push towards social justice was that, when founded, it was the only American union (besides the Knights of Labor) to welcome all workers including women, immigrants, African Americans and Asians into the same organization. Indeed, many of its early members were immigrants, and some, like Carlo Tresca, Joe Hill and Mary Jones, rose to prominence in the leadership. Finns formed a sizeable portion of the immigrant IWW membership. &quot; Conceivably, the number of Finns belonging to the I.W.W. was somewhere between five and ten thousand. &quot; [ http://www.genealogia.fi/emi/art/article257e.htm Finnish-American Workmen&apos;s Associations Auvo Kostiainen Genealogia.fi 1919-11-22 2009-08-20 ] The Finnish-language newspaper of the IWW, Industrialisti, published out of Duluth, Minnesota, was the union&apos;s only daily paper. At its peak, it ran 10,000 copies per issue. Another Finnish-language Wobbly publication was the monthly Tie Vapauteen ( &quot; Road to Freedom &quot; ). Also of note was the Finnish IWW educational institute, the Work People&apos;s College in Duluth, and the Finnish Labour Temple in Port Arthur, Ontario which served as the IWW Canadian administration for several years. One example of the union&apos;s commitment to equality was Local 8, a longshoremen&apos;s branch in Philadelphia, one of the largest ports in the nation in the WWI era. Led by the African American Ben Fletcher, Local 8 had over 5,000 members, the majority of whom were African American, along with more than a thousand immigrants (primarily Lithuanians and Poles), Irish Americans, and numerous others. The IWW was condemned by politicians and the press, who saw them as a threat to the market systems as well as an effort to monopolize labor at a time when efforts to monopolize industries were being fought as anti-market. Factory owners would employ means both non-violent (sending in Salvation Army bands to drown out speakers) and violent means to disrupt their meetings. Members were often arrested and sometimes killed for making public speeches, but this persecution only inspired further militancy. [ Political action or direct action? ] [ Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics ] The IWW split over policy. [ March 2012 ] In 1908 a group led by Daniel DeLeon argued that political action through DeLeon&apos;s Socialist Labor Party (SLP) was the best way to attain the IWW&apos;s goals. The other faction, led by Vincent Saint John, William Trautmann, and Big Bill Haywood, believed that direct action in the form of strikes, propaganda, and boycott s was more likely to accomplish sustainable gains for working people; they were opposed to arbitration and to political affiliation. Haywood&apos;s faction prevailed, and De Leon and his supporters left the organization, forming their own version of the IWW. The SLP&apos;s &quot; Yellow IWW &quot; eventually took the name Workers&apos; International Industrial Union, which was disbanded in 1924.

Further fame was gained later that year, when they took their stand on free speech. The town of Spokane, Washington had outlawed street meetings, and arrested Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, [ Arksey Laura http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id%3D7462 Spokane  — Thumbnail History at &apos; &amp; #39;SpokaneHistory.org&apos; &amp; #39; Historylink.org 2005-09-04 2009-08-20 ] a Wobbly organizer, for breaking this ordinance. The response was simple but effective: when a fellow member was arrested for speaking, large numbers of people descended on the location and invited the authorities to arrest all of them, until it became too expensive for the town. In Spokane, over 500 people went to jail and four people died. The tactic of fighting for free speech to popularize the cause and preserve the right to organize openly was used effectively in Fresno, Aberdeen, and other locations. In San Diego, although there was no particular organizing campaign at stake, vigilantes supported by local officials and powerful businessmen mounted a particularly brutal counter-offensive. 1914 IWW demonstration in New York City By 1912 the organization had around 25,000 members, { Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905-1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 147 } concentrated in the Northwest, among dock workers, agricultural workers in the central states, and in textile and mining areas. The IWW was involved in over 150 strikes, including the Lawrence textile strike (1912), the Paterson silk strike (1913) and the Mesabi range (1916). They were also involved in what came to be known as the Wheatland Hop Riot on August 3, 1913. Between 1915 and 1917, the IWW&apos;s Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) organized more than a hundred thousand migratory farm workers throughout the Midwest and western United States, { Henry E. McGuckin, Memoirs of a Wobbly, Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company, 1987, page 70 } often signing up and organizing members in the field, in rail yards and in hobo jungles. During this time, the IWW member became synonymous with the hobo riding the rails; migratory farmworkers could scarcely afford any other means of transportation to get to the next jobsite. Railroad boxcars, called &quot; side door coaches &quot; by the hobos, were frequently plastered with silent agitators from the IWW. Workers often won better working conditions by using direct action at the point of production, and striking &quot; on the job &quot; (consciously and collectively slowing their work). As a result of Wobbly organizing, conditions for migratory farm workers improved significantly. [ August 2011 ] Building on the success of the AWO, the IWW&apos;s Lumber Workers Industrial Union (LWIU) used similar tactics to organize lumberjack s and other timber workers, both in the deep South and the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada, between 1917 and 1924. The IWW lumber strike of 1917 led to the eight-hour day and vastly improved working conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Even though mid-century historians would give credit to the US Government and &quot; forward thinking lumber magnates &quot; for agreeing to such reforms, an IWW strike forced these concessions. [ One Big Union 1986 ] From 1913 through the mid-1930s, the IWW&apos;s Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union (MTWIU), proved a force to be reckoned with and competed with AFL unions for ascendance in the industry. Given the union&apos;s commitment to international solidarity, its efforts and success in the field come as no surprise. Local 8 of the Marine Transport Workers was led by Ben Fletcher, who organized predominantly African-American longshoremen on the Philadelphia and Baltimore waterfronts, but other leaders included the Swiss immigrant Waler Nef, Jack Walsh, E.F. Doree, and the Spanish sailor Manuel Rey. The IWW also had a presence among waterfront workers in Boston, New York City, New Orleans, Houston, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Eureka, Portland, Tacoma, Seattle, Vancouver as well as in ports in the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and other nations. IWW members played a role in the 1934 San Francisco general strike and the other organizing efforts by rank-and-filers within the International Longshoremen&apos;s Association up and down the West Coast. Wobblies also played a role in the sit-down strikes and other organizing efforts by the United Auto Workers in the 1930s, particularly in Detroit, though they never established a strong union presence there. Where the IWW did win strikes, such as in Lawrence, they often found it hard to hold onto their gains. The IWW of 1912 disdained collective bargaining agreement s and preached instead the need for constant struggle against the boss on the shop floor. It proved difficult, however, to maintain that sort of revolutionary elán against employers. In Lawrence, the IWW lost nearly all of its membership in the years after the strike, as the employers wore down their employees&apos; resistance and eliminated many of the strongest union supporters. In 1938, the IWW voted to allow contracts with employers, { The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 100 } so long as they would not undermine any strike. [ Government suppression ] { Joseph J. Ettor, who had been arrested in 1912, giving a speech to barbers on strike } The IWW&apos;s efforts were met with violent reactions from all levels of government, from company management and their agents, and from groups of citizens functioning as vigilantes. In 1914, Joe Hill (Joel Hägglund) was accused of murder and, despite only circumstantial evidence, was executed by the state of Utah in 1915. On November 5, 1916 at Everett, Washington a group of deputized businessmen led by Sheriff Donald McRae attacked Wobblies on the steamer Verona, killing at least five union members (six more were never accounted for and probably were lost in Puget Sound). Two members of the police force  — one a regular officer and another a deputized citizen from the National Guard Reserve  — were killed, probably by &quot; friendly fire &quot;. { &quot; Although the exact circumstances are unknown, it is thought that both deputies were struck by friendly fire. &quot; Deputy Sheriff Jefferson F. Beard at the Officer Down Memorial Page. } { &quot; Although the exact circumstances are unknown, it is thought that both deputies were struck by friendly fire. &quot; Deputy Sheriff Charles O. Curtiss at the Officer Down Memorial Page. } Many IWW members opposed United States participation in World War I. The organization passed a resolution against the war at its convention in November 1916. { Peter Carlson, Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood (1983), pages 241. } This echoed the view, expressed at the IWW&apos;s founding convention, that war represents struggles among capitalists in which the rich become richer, and the working poor all too often die at the hands of other workers. An IWW newspaper, the Industrial Worker, wrote just before the U.S. declaration of war: &quot; Capitalists of America, we will fight against you, not for you! There is not a power in the world that can make the working class fight if they refuse. &quot; Yet when a declaration of war was passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1917, the IWW&apos;s general secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood became determined that the organization should adopt a low profile in order to avoid perceived threats to its existence. The printing of anti-war stickers was discontinued, stockpiles of existing anti-war documents were put into storage, and anti-war propagandizing ceased as official union policy. After much debate on the General Executive Board, with Haywood advocating a low profile and GEB member Frank Little championing continued agitation, Ralph Chaplin brokered a compromise agreement. A statement was issued that denounced the war, but IWW members were advised to channel their opposition through the legal mechanisms of conscription. They were advised to register for the draft, marking their claims for exemption &quot; IWW, opposed to war. &quot; { Peter Carlson, Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood (1983), pp. 242-244. } In spite of the IWW moderating its vocal opposition, the mainstream press and the U.S. Government were able to turn public opinion against the IWW. Frank Little, the IWW&apos;s most outspoken war opponent, was lynched in Butte, Montana in August 1917, just four months after war had been declared. The government used World War I as an opportunity to crush the IWW. In September 1917, U.S. Department of Justice agents made simultaneous raids on forty-eight IWW meeting halls across the country. In 1917, one hundred and sixty-five IWW leaders were arrested for conspiring to hinder the draft, encourage desertion, and intimidate others in connection with labor disputes, under the new Espionage Act; one hundred and one went on trial before Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis in 1918. In 1917, during an incident known as the Tulsa Outrage, a group of black-robed Knights of Liberty, a short-lived faction of the Ku Klux Klan, tarred and feathered seventeen members of the IWW in Oklahoma. The IWW members had been turned over to the Knights of Liberty by local authorities after they were convicted of the crime of not owning war bonds. Five other men who testified in defense of the Wobblies were also fined by the court and subjected to the same torture and humiliations at the hands of the Knights of Liberty. { Chapman, Lee Roy, Published September 1, 2011, accessed September 19, 2011. } [ Why the IWW Is Not Patriotic to the United States ] They were all convicted  — even those who had not been members of the union for years  — and given prison terms of up to twenty years. Sentenced to prison by Judge Landis and released on bail, Haywood fled to the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic where he remained until his death. A wave of such incitement led to vigilante mobs attacking the IWW in many places, and after the war the repression continued. In Centralia, Washington on November 11, 1919, IWW member and army veteran Wesley Everest was turned over to the lynch mob by jail guards and lynched. Although a myth was created six months after the events that Everest was castrated, the historical record does not support it. { See: &quot; Wesley Everest, IWW Martyr &quot; Pacific Northwest Quarterly, October 1986 } Members of the IWW were prosecuted under various State and federal laws and the 1920 Palmer Raids singled out the foreign-born members of the organization. By the mid-1920s membership was already declining due to government repression and it decreased again substantially during a contentious organizational schism in 1924 when the organization split between the &quot; Westerners &quot; and the &quot; Easterners &quot; over a number of issues, including the role of the General Administration (often oversimplified as a struggle between &quot; centralists &quot; and &quot; decentralists &quot; ) and attempts by the Communist Party to dominate the organization. By 1930 membership was down to around 10,000. One result of the Palmer Raids was the confiscation of Joe Hill&apos;s ashes, among other items taken from IWW offices. These ashes were recovered under the Freedom of Information Act in the late 1980s. [ November 2010 ] [ Activity after World War II ] [ 1949-2000 ] The Wobblies continued to organize workers and were a major presence in the metal shops of Cleveland, Ohio until the 1950s. After the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1946 by Congress, which called for the removal of Communist union leadership, the IWW experienced a loss of membership as differences of opinion occurred over how to respond to the challenge. In 1949, Tom C. Clark [ Tyler Robert L.

The Cleveland IWW metal and machine workers wound up leaving the union, resulting in a major decline in membership once again. The IWW membership fell to its lowest level in the 1950s, but the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, anti-war protests, and various university student movements brought new life to the IWW, albeit with many fewer new members than the great organizing drives of the early part of the 20th Century. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the IWW had various small organizing drives. Membership included a number of cooperatively owned and collectively run enterprises especially in the printing industry: Black &amp; Red (Detroit), Lakeside ( Madison, Wisconsin ), and Harbinger ( Columbia, South Carolina ). The University Cellar, a non-profit campus bookstore formed by University of Michigan students, was for several years the largest organized IWW shop with about 100 workers. Ann Arbor was also home to the Peoples Wherehouse which was believed to be the largest shop at the time (1980s). In the 1960s, Rebel Worker was published in Chicago by the surrealists Franklin and Penelope Rosemont. One edition was published in London with Charles Radcliffe who went on to become involved with the Situationist International. By the 1980s, the &quot; Rebel Worker &quot; was being published as an official organ again, from the IWW&apos;s headquarters in Chicago, and the New York area was publishing a newsletter as well; a record album of Wobbly music, &quot; Rebel Voices &quot;, was also released. In the 1990s, the IWW was involved in many labor struggles and free speech fights, including Redwood Summer, and the picketing of the Neptune Jade in the port of Oakland in late 1997. Three IWW General Secretary-Treasurers: Mark Kaufman, Jeff Ditz, and Fred Chase, at a funeral for a friend. Memorial service IWW organizing drives in recent years have included a major campaign to organize Borders Books in 1996, a strike at the Lincoln Park Mini Mall in Seattle that same year, organizing drives at Wherehouse Music, Keystone Job Corps, the community organization ACORN, various homeless and youth centers in Portland, Oregon, sex industry workers, and recycling shops in Berkeley, California. IWW members have been active in the building trades, marine transport, ship yards, high tech industries, hotels and restaurants, public interest organizations, schools and universities, recycling centers, railroads, bike messengers, and lumber yards. The IWW has stepped in several times to help the rank and file in mainstream unions, including saw mill workers in Fort Bragg in California in 1989, concession stand workers in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1990s, and most recently at shipyards along the Mississippi River. [ 2000-present ] In the early 2000s (decade), the IWW organized Stonemountain and Daughter Fabrics, a fabric shop in Berkeley. The shop has remained under contract with the IWW to this day. In 2004, an IWW union was organized in a New York City Starbucks. In 2006, the IWW continued efforts at Starbucks by organizing several Chicago area shops. { Philip Dawdy, A Union Shop on Every Block, Seattle Weekly, December 7, 2005. Retrieved September 24, 2006. } { Damon Agnos, Back to the Future: Starbucks vs. the Wobblies, Seattle Weekly, May 4, 2009. Retrieved March 4, 2010. } In September 2004, IWW-organized short haul truck drivers in Stockton, California walked off their jobs and went on a strike. Nearly all demands were met. Despite early victories in Stockton, the truck driver union ceased to exist in mid-2005. { Seattle. } In Chicago the IWW began an effort to organize bicycle messenger s with some success. Between 2003 and 2006, the IWW organized unions at food co-operatives in Seattle, Washington and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The IWW represents administrative and maintenance workers under contract in Seattle, while the union in Pittsburgh lost 22-21 in an NLRB election, only to have the results invalidated in late 2006, based on management&apos;s behavior before the election. The city of Berkeley&apos;s recycling is picked up, sorted, processed and sent out all through two different IWW-organized enterprises. In New York City, the IWW has been organizing immigrant foodstuffs workers since 2005. That summer, workers from Handyfat Trading joined the IWW, and were soon followed by workers from four more warehouses. { Caitlin Esch, Wobblies Organize Brooklyn Warehouses, Brooklyn Rail, April 2007. } Workers at these warehouses made gains such as receiving the minimum wage and being paid overtime. In May 2007, the NYC warehouse workers came together with the Starbucks Workers Union to form The Food and Allied Workers Union IU 460/640. In the summer of 2007, the IWW organized workers at two new warehouses: Flaum Appetizing, a Kosher food distributor, and Wild Edibles, a seafood company. Over the course of 2007-08, workers at both shops were illegally terminated for their union activity. In 2008, the workers at Wild Edibles actively fought to get their jobs back and to secure overtime pay owed to them by the boss. { Krauthamer, Diane. &apos;&apos;Taming Wild Edibles&apos;&apos; iww.org February 3, 2008. } Besides IWW&apos;s traditional practice of organizing industrially, the Union has been open to new methods such as organizing geographically: for instance, seeking to organize retail workers in a certain business district, as in Philadelphia. The union has also participated in such worker-related issues as protesting involvement in the war in Iraq, opposing sweatshops and supporting a boycott of Coca Cola for that company&apos;s support of the suppression of workers rights in Colombia. In 2006, the IWW moved its headquarters to Cincinnati, Ohio, and in 2010, headquarters was moved back to Chicago, Illinois. Also in 2006, the IWW Bay Area Branch organized the Landmark Shattuck Cinemas. The Union has been negotiating for a contract and hopes to gain one through workplace democracy and organizing directly and taking action when necessary. On July 5, 2008, the Grand Rapids, Michigan, Starbucks Workers Union and CNT-FAI in Seville, Spain, organized a global day of action against alleged Starbucks union-busting, in particular the firing of two union members in Grand Rapids and Seville. According to the Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union website, [ Posted by Wobblybarista http://grsbuxunion.blogspot.com/2008/07/list-of-cities-and-countries-that.html Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union (IWW) - For An Organized Fair Trade Future: List of cities and countries that participated in the July 5 actions Grsbuxunion.blogspot.com 2008-07-06 2009-08-20 ] pickets were held in several dozen cities in more than a dozen countries. The Portland, Oregon General Membership Branch is one of the largest and most active branches of the IWW currently. The branch holds one contract currently, with Janus Youth Services. There has been much debate within the branch about whether or not union contracts such as this are desirable in the long run, with most members favoring solidarity unionism as opposed to contract unionism. The branch has successfully supported workers wrongfully fired from several different workplaces in the last two years. Due to frequent picketing by Wobblies, these workers have received significant compensation from their former employers. Branch membership has been on a steep incline overall and continues to trend upwards, as does shop organizing. The Portland GMB also hosts many social and educational events, notably Music for the Working Class, a free event that occurs on the last Wednesday of every month at the Red and Black Cafe, 400 SE 12th St. Acts that have appeared include Brendan Phillips and Fast Rattler, David Rovics, and the unofficial band of the Portland branch, I Wobble Wobble. The branch annually hosts a month-long Wobtoberfest—a series of music shows, film showings and educational events in October. As of 2005, the 100th anniversary of its founding, the IWW had around 5,000 members, compared to 13 million members in the AFL-CIO. { Moberg, David, Culture: Power to the Pictures, In These Times Magazine, 19 July 2005 } Other IWW branches are located in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. [ Outside the US ] [ In Australia ] Australia encountered the IWW tradition early. In part this was due to the local De Leonist SLP following the industrial turn of the US SLP. The SLP formed an IWW Club in Sydney in October 1907. Members of other socialist groups also joined it, and the special relationship with the SLP soon proved to be a problem. The 1908 split between the Chicago and Detroit factions in the United States was echoed by internal unrest in the Australian IWW from late 1908, resulting in the formation of a pro-Chicago local in Adelaide in May 1911 and another in Sydney six months later. By mid 1913 the &quot; Chicago &quot; IWW was flourishing and the SLP-associated pro-Detroit IWW Club in decline. { Turner, Industrial Labour and Politics: The Dynamics of the Labour Movement in Eastern Australia 1900-1921, p56-58 p64-66, Australian National University Press, Canberra, 1965 } In 1916 the &quot; Detroit &quot; IWW in Australia followed the lead of the US body and renamed itself the Workers&apos; International Industrial Union. { Turner, Industrial Labour and Politics: The Dynamics of the Labour Movement in Eastern Australia 1900-1921, p 150, Australian National University Press, Canberra, 1965 } The early Australian IWW used a number of tactics from the US, including free speech fights. However, there early appeared significant differences of practice between the Australian IWW and its US parent; the Australian IWW tended to co-operate where possible with existing unions rather than forming its own, and in contrast with the US body took an extremely open and forthright stand against involvement in World War One. The IWW cooperated with many other unions, encouraging industrial unionism and militancy. In particular, the IWW&apos;s strategies had a large effect on the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. The AMIEU established closed shops and workers councils and effectively regulated management behaviour toward the end of the 1910s. Australian anti-conscription poster, 1916 The IWW was well known for opposing the First World War from 1914 onwards, and in many ways was at the front of the anti-conscription fight. A narrow majority of Australians voted against conscription in a very bitter hard-fought referendum in October 1916, and then again in December 1917, Australia being the only belligerent in World War One without conscription. In very significant part this was due to the agitation of the IWW, a group which probably never had as many as 500 members in Australia at its peak. The IWW founded the Anti-Conscription League (ACL) in which IWW members worked with the broader labour and peace movement, and also carried on an aggressive propaganda campaign in its own name; leading to the imprisonment of Tom Barker (1887–1970) the editor of the IWW paper Direct Action, sentenced to twelve months in March 1916. A series of arson attacks on commercial properties in Sydney was widely attributed to the IWW campaign to have Tom Barker released. He was indeed released in August 1916, but twelve mostly prominent IWW activists, the so-called Sydney Twelve were arrested in NSW in September 1916 for arson and other offences. (Their trial and eventual imprisonment would become a cause célèbre of the Australian labour movement on the basis that there was no convincing evidence that any of them had been involved in the arson attacks.) A number of other scandals were associated with the IWW, a five pound note forgery scandal, the so-called Tottenham tragedy in which the murder of a police officer was blamed on the IWW, and above all the IWW was blamed for the defeat of the October 1916 conscription referendum. In December 1916 the Commonwealth government led by Labour Party renegade Billy Hughes declared the IWW an illegal organization under the Unlawful Associations Act. Eighty six IWW members immediately defied the law and were sentenced to six months imprisonment, this was certainly a high percentage of the Australian IWW&apos;s active membership but it is not known how high. Direct Action was suppressed, its circulation was at its peak of something over 12,000. [ Turner Ian 1965 Industrial Labour and Politics: The Dynamics of the Labour Movement in Eastern Australia 1900-1921 Australian National University Press Canberra ] During the war over 100 IWW members Australia-wide were sentenced to imprisonment on political charges, [ Oliver Bobbie 1995 War and Peace in Western Australia: The Social and Political Impact of the Great War 1914-1926 University of Western Australia Press Western Australia 1-875560-57-2 81 ] including the veteran activist and icon of the labour, socialist and anarchist movements Monty Miller. The IWW continued illegally operating with the aim of freeing its class war prisoners and briefly fused with two other radical tendencies – from the old Socialist parties and Trades Halls – to form a larval communist party at the suggestion of the militant revolutionist and Council Communist Adela Pankhurst. The IWW, however, left the CPA shortly after its formation. By the 1930s the IWW in Australia had declined significantly, and took part in unemployed workers movements which were led largely by the CPA. The poet Harry Hooton became involved with it around this time. In 1939 the Australian IWW had four members, according to surveillance by government authorities, and these members were consistently opposed to the Second World War. (See files in National Archives of Australia). After the Second World War, the IWW would become one of the influences on the Sydney Libertarians who were in turn a significant cultural and political influence IWW members picket in Sydney, June 1981 Today the IWW still exists in Australia, in larger numbers than the 1940s, but due to the nature of the Australian industrial relations system, it is unlikely to win union representation in any workplaces in the immediate future. More significant is its continuing place in the mythology of the militant end of the Australian labour movement. { &quot; Flowers For the Rebels Faded &quot; Workers&apos; Online Issue 102, Accessed November 12, 2007, } As an extreme example of the integration of ex-IWW militants into the mainstream labour movement one might instance the career of Donald Grant, one of the Sydney Twelve sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for conspiracy to commit arson and other crimes. Released unbowed from prison in August 1920 he would soon break with the IWW over its anti-political stand, standing for the NSW Parliament for the Industrial Socialist Labour Party unsuccessfully in 1922 and then in 1925 for the mainstream Australian Labor Party (ALP) also unsuccessfully. But this reconciliation with the ALP and the electoral system did not prevent him being imprisoned again in 1927 for street demonstrations supporting Sacco and Vanzetti. He would eventually represent the ALP in the NSW Legislative Council in 1931-1940 and the Australian Senate 1943-1956. { Australian National Dictionary of Biography, accessed November 16, 2007, print publication details: Frank Farrell, &apos;Grant, Donald McLennan (1888 - 1970)&apos;, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, Melbourne University Press, 1983, pp 75-76, } No other member of the Australian IWW actually entered Parliament but Grants career is emblematic in the sense that the ex-IWW militants by and large remained in the broader labour movement, bringing some greater or lesser part of their heritage with them. &quot; Bump Me Into Parliament &quot; [ http://unionsong.com/u005.html Bump me into Parliament Unionsong.com 2009-08-20 ] is the most notable Australian IWW song, and is still current. It was written by ship&apos;s fireman William &quot; Bill &quot; Casey, later Secretary of the Seaman&apos;s Union in Queensland. [ In the UK ] Although much smaller than their North American counterparts, the BIROC (British Isles Regional Organising Committee) reported in 2006 that there were nearly 200 members in the UK and Ireland out of a total membership of around 5,000. The British Advocates of Industrial Unionism, founded in 1906, supported the IWW. This group split in 1908, with the majority supporting DeLeon and a minority around E. J. B. Allen founding the Industrialist Union and developing links with the Chicago-based IWW. Allen&apos;s group soon disappeared, but the first IWW group in Britain was founded by members of the Industrial Syndicalist Education League around Guy Bowman in 1913. The IWW was present to varying extents in many of the struggles in the early decades of the 20th century, including the UK General Strike of 1926 and the dockers&apos; strike of 1947. During the decade after World War II, the IWW had two active branches in London and Glasgow. These soon died off, before a modest resurgence in North-West England during the 1970s. More recently, IWW members were involved in the Liverpool docker s &apos; strike that took place between 1995 and 1998, and numerous other events and struggles throughout the 1990s and 2000s (decade), including the successful unionising of several workplaces, such as support workers for the Scottish Socialist Party. Between 2001 and 2003, there was a marked increase in UK membership, with the creation of the Hull GMB. During this time the Hull branch had 27 members of good standing, being at that time the largest branch outside of the US. In 2005, the IWW&apos;s centenary year, a stone was laid in a forest in Wales commemorating the centenary, and the death of US IWW and Earth First! activist Judi Bari. 2006 saw the IWW formally registered by the UK government as a recognised trade union. The IWW has launched a website { Industrial Workers of the world | iww.org.uk } and has branches in a number of major cities and several organizing groups around the UK alongside two growing industrial networks for health and education workers. The largest branches are found in Glasgow, Leicester, London and the West Midlands conurbation (largely Birmingham ). The IWW publishes a magazine aimed at the British and Irish members, Bread and Roses, a national industrial newsletter for health workers and a specific bulletin for workers in the National Blood Service. In 2007 it launched a campaign alongside the anti-capitalist group No Sweat which attempts to replicate some of the successes of the US IWW&apos;s organising drives amongst Starbucks workers. In the same year its health-workers&apos; network launched a national campaign against cuts in the National Blood Service, which is ongoing. In 2007, IWW branches in Glasgow and Dumfries were a key driving force in a successful campaign to prevent the closure of one of Glasgow University &apos;s campuses, ( The Crichton ) in Dumfries, Dumfriesshire. [ http://iwwscotland.org/category/crichton-campus/ Crichton Campus &quot; IWW Scotland Iwwscotland.org 2007-08-21 2009-08-20 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] The campaign united IWW members, other unions, students and the local community to build a powerful coalition. Its success, coupled with the ongoing Blood Service campaign, has raised the IWW&apos;s profile significantly since early 2007. In 2011, the IWW representing cleaners at the Guildhall won back pay and the right to collective negotiation with their employers, Ocean. Also in 2011, branches of the IWW were set up in Lincoln, Manchester &amp; Sheffield (notably workers employed by Pizza Hut). [ In Canada ] The IWW was active in Canada from a very early point in the organization&apos;s history, especially in Western Canada, primarily in British Columbia. The union was active in organizing large swaths of the lumber and mining industry along the coast, in the Interior of BC, and Vancouver Island. Joe Hill wrote the song &quot; Where the Fraser River Flows &quot; during this period when the IWW was organizing in British Columbia. Some members of the IWW had relatively close links with the Socialist Party of Canada. [ http://www.socialisthistory.ca/Docs/Imposs/Impossibilists1.htm Canadian Socialist History Project Socialisthistory.ca 1919-06-11 2009-08-20 ] Arthur &quot; Slim &quot; Evans, organizer in the Relief Camp Workers&apos; Union and the On-to-Ottawa Trek was once a Wobbly, although during the On-to-Ottawa Trek he was with the One Big Union, which had direct ties with the Communist Party of Canada [ June 2008 ]. He was also a friend of another well known Canadian Wobbly, Ginger Goodwin, who was shot in Cumberland, British Columbia by a Dominion Police constable when he was resisting the First World War. The impact of Ginger Goodwin goes past the IWW and influenced various left and progressive groups in Canada, including a progressive group of MPs in the House of Commons called the Ginger Group. Today the IWW remains active in the country with numerous branches in Vancouver, Vancouver Island, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto and Montréal. The largest branch is currently in Edmonton. Among current and more notable IWW shops in Canada is the Ottawa Panhandlers&apos; Union, which continues a tradition in the IWW of organizing disenfranchised workers on relief or in work camps started during the Great Depression. In the spirit of organizing industrially, any who make their living in the street, such as buskers, street vendors, or panhandlers are welcome to join the Ottawa Panhandlers&apos; Union. [ In Germany, Switzerland, Austria ] A Regional Organizing Committee has recently been formed for the German speaking countries of Europe. They maintain a website [ http://www.wobblies.de/ wobblies  — internationale gewerkschaft» industrial workers of the world im deutschsprachigen raum Wobblies.de 2009-08-20 ] with many translated IWW documents and 16 city contacts in Germany, Switzerland and Austria as of May &apos;09. [ Folk music and protest songs ] Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent: The &quot; Little Red Songbook &quot; One Wobbly characteristic since their inception has been a penchant for song. To counteract management sending in the Salvation Army band to cover up the Wobbly speakers, Joe Hill wrote parodies of Christian hymn s so that union members could sing along with the Salvation Army band, but with their own purposes. For example, &quot; In the Sweet By and By &quot; became &quot; There&apos;ll Be Pie in the Sky When You Die (That&apos;s a Lie) &quot;. From that start in exigency, Wobbly song writing became common because they &quot; articulated the frustrations, hostilities, and humor of the homeless and the dispossessed. &quot; { Kornbluh, Joyce L., Rebel Voices: An I.W.W. Anthology, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1964 p.131 } The IWW collected its official songs in the Little Red Songbook and continues to update this book to the present time. In the 1960s, the American folk music revival in the United States brought a renewed interest in the songs of Joe Hill and other Wobblies, and seminal folk revival figures such as Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie had a pro-Wobbly tone, while some were members of the IWW. Among the protest song s in the book are &quot; Hallelujah, I&apos;m a Bum &quot; (this song was never popular among members, and removed after appearing in only the first edition), &quot; Union Maid &quot;, and &quot; I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night &quot;. Perhaps the best known IWW song is &quot; Solidarity Forever &quot;. The songs have been performed by dozens of artists, and Utah Phillips performed the songs in concert and on recordings for decades. Other prominent IWW song-writers include Ralph Chaplin who authored &quot; Solidarity Forever &quot;, and Leslie Fish. The Finnish IWW community produced several folk singers, poets and song-writers, the most famous being Matti Valentine Huhta (better known as T-Bone Slim ), who penned &quot; The Popular Wobbly &quot; and &quot; The Mysteries of a Hobo&apos;s Life &quot;. Slim&apos;s poem, &quot; The Lumberjack&apos;s Prayer &quot; was recorded by Studs Terkel on labor singer Bucky Halker&apos;s CD, &quot; Don&apos;t Want Your Millions &quot; (Revolting Records, 2000). Hiski Salomaa, whose songs were composed entirely in Finnish (and Finglish ), remains a widely recognized early folk musician in his native Finland as well as in sections of the Midwest United States, Northern Ontario, and other areas of North America with high concentrations of Finns. Salomaa, who was a tailor by trade, has been referred to as the Finnish Woody Guthrie. Arthur Kylander, who worked as a lumberjack, is a lesser known, but important Finnish I.W.W. folk musician. Kylander&apos;s lyrics range from the difficulties of the immigrant labourer&apos;s experience to more humorous themes. Arguably, the wanderer, a recurring theme in Finnish folklore dating back to pre-Christian oral tradition (as with Lemminkäinen in the Kalevala ), translated quite easily to the music of Huhta, Salomaa, and Kylander; each of whom have songs about the trials and tribulations of the hobo. [ Lingo ] [ Wobbly lingo ] The origin of the name &quot; Wobbly &quot; is uncertain. Many [ October 2010 ] believe it refers to a tool known as a &quot; wobble saw &quot; [ October 2010 ]. { Mark Leier, Where the Fraser River Flows: The Industrial Workers of the World in British Columbia.

It has long been rumored, but not yet proven, that baseball legend Honus Wagner was also a Wobbly. Senator Joe McCarthy accused Edward R. Murrow of having been an IWW member. Two of the organization&apos;s most famous current members are Noam Chomsky and Tom Morello.
