Once apprehended, Leopold and Loeb retained Clarence Darrow as counsel for the defense. Darrow’s summation in their trial is noted for its influential criticism of capital punishment and retributive, as opposed to rehabilitative, penal systems. Leopold and Loeb have been the inspiration for several works in film, theater and fiction, such as the 1929 play Rope by Patrick Hamilton and Alfred Hitchcock &apos;s 1948 film of the same name. [ Early lives ] Both Leopold and Loeb were exceptionally intelligent. Leopold was a child prodigy who spoke his first words at the age of four months; he reportedly had an intelligence quotient of 210, { The Biography Channel &quot; Notorious Crime Profiles: Leopold and Loeb, Partners in Crime &quot;, Retrieved January 5, 2009. } though this is not directly comparable to scores on modern IQ tests.

Loeb was the youngest graduate in the history of the University of Michigan and planned to enter the University of Chicago Law School after taking some postgraduate courses. Leopold planned to transfer to Harvard Law School in September after taking a trip to Europe. The Leopold, Loeb, and Franks families lived in the affluent Kenwood neighborhood on Chicago&apos;s Southside some six miles south of downtown. Loeb&apos;s father, Albert, began his career as a lawyer and became the vice president of Sears and Roebuck. Besides owning an impressive mansion in Kenwood, two blocks from the Leopold home, the Loeb family had a summer estate, Castle Farms, in Charlevoix, Michigan. Leopold and Loeb met at the University of Chicago as teenagers. Leopold agreed to act as Loeb&apos;s accomplice. { Leopold and Loeb&apos;s Perfect Crime by Denise Noe. Retrieved November 4, 2007. } Beginning with petty theft, the pair committed a series of more and more serious crimes, culminating in the murder. Leopold was age 19 at the time of the murder, and Loeb, 18. They believed themselves to be Nietzschean supermen who could commit a &quot; perfect crime &quot; (in this case a kidnapping and murder). { The Leopold and Loeb Trial:A Brief Account by Douglas O. Linder. 1997. Retrieved April 11, 2007. } Before the murder, Leopold had written to Loeb: &quot; A superman... is, on account of certain superior qualities inherent in him, exempted from the ordinary laws which govern men. He is not liable for anything he may do. &quot; { Simon Baatz, For the Thrill of It. New York: Harper, 2008. } [ Murder of Robert Franks ] Robert &quot; Bobby &quot; Franks with his father in 1920. Leopold and Loeb spent seven months planning the murder, the disposal of the body, and devising a plan to get ransom money with little or no risk of being caught. { Statement of Nathan F. Leopold Northwestern University Retrieved October 30, 2007. } They put their plot into motion on Wednesday, May 21, 1924. After a search, the pair finally decided upon Robert &quot; Bobby &quot; Franks, the son of Chicago millionaire Jacob Franks. Future Hollywood producer Armand Deutsch, the then 11-year-old grandson of Julius Rosenwald later claimed he might have been the intended victim of Loeb or Leopold. However on the day of the murder he was picked up by his family&apos;s chauffeur after school because he had a prior dental appointment. Deutsch died aged 92 on August 13, 2005.

With Franks in the vehicle, one of them drove and the other one sat in the back armed with a chisel. It is not known who struck the first blow with the murder weapon. { Statement of Richard Loeb Northwestern University Retrieved October 30, 2007. } During the attack, a sock was stuffed into the schoolboy&apos;s mouth, and he died soon after. Contrary to rumors that Franks had been sexually assaulted, the trial judge would later state that conclusive evidence convinced him that no abuse had been committed. { Leopold, Loeb &amp; The Crime of the Century, pg 265 } The killers covered the body and drove to a remote area near Wolf Lake in Hammond, Indiana. They removed Franks&apos;s clothes and left them at the side of the road. Leopold and Loeb poured hydrochloric acid { Crime Library  – Enter Clarence Darrow.

After finishing their meal, they concealed the body in a culvert at the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks near 118th street, north of Wolf Lake. After returning to Chicago, they called Franks&apos;s mother and said her son had been kidnapped. They mailed the ransom note to the Franks family. The killers burned items of their own clothing that had been spotted with blood. They also attempted to clean bloodstains from the upholstery of their rented automobile. The two then spent the rest of the evening playing cards. Before the Franks family could pay the ransom, Tony Minke, a Polish immigrant, discovered the body. When Leopold and Loeb learned that the body had been found, they destroyed the typewriter used to write the ransom note and burned the robe used to move the body. However, Detective Hugh Patrick Byrne, while searching for evidence, discovered a pair of eyeglasses near the body, unremarkable except for an unusual hinge mechanism. In Chicago, only three people had purchased glasses with such a mechanism, one of whom was Nathan Leopold. { The Glasses: The Key Link to Leopold and Loeb UMKC Law. Retrieved April 11, 2007. } Upon being questioned, Leopold told police he had lost the glasses while birdwatching. { Chicago Daily News, June 2, 1924 } Loeb told the police that Leopold was with him the night of the murder. Leopold and Loeb claimed they had picked up two women in Leopold&apos;s car and had dropped them off near a golf course, never learning their last names. Leopold&apos;s car, however, was being repaired by his chauffeur and the chauffeur&apos;s wife confirmed that the car had been in the Leopold garage that night. During police questioning, Leopold&apos;s and Loeb&apos;s alibis fell apart. Loeb confessed first, followed by Leopold. { Chicago Daily News, September 10, 1924, pg.3 } Although their confessions corroborated most of the facts in the case, each blamed the other for the actual killing. Most commentators believe that Loeb struck the blow that killed Franks. However, which of the two actually wielded the weapon that killed Franks would never be known. Psychiatrists at the trial, impressed by Leopold&apos;s intelligence, agreed that Loeb had struck the fatal blow. However, the circumstantial evidence in the case, including eyewitness testimony by Carl Ulvigh (who saw Loeb driving with Leopold in the back seat minutes before the kidnapping), indicated that Leopold may have been the killer. { Leopold, Loeb &amp; The Crime of the Century, by Hal Higdon, pg 319 } The ransom was not their primary motive; the young men&apos;s families provided them all the money that they needed. Both had admitted that they were driven by the thrill of the kill and the desire to commit the &quot; perfect crime &quot;. [ Trial ] Ransom note Defense attorney Clarence Darrow. The trial became a media spectacle. Held at Courthouse Place, it was one of the first cases in the U.S. to be dubbed the &quot; Trial of the Century &quot;. { JURIST - The Trial of Leopold and Loeb, Prof. Douglas Linder. Retrieved November 1, 2007. } Loeb&apos;s family hired 67-year-old Clarence Darrow —a well-known opponent of capital punishment —to defend the men against the capital charges of murder and kidnapping. { Gilbert Geis and Leigh B. Bienen, Crimes of the Century (Boston, 1998). } While the media expected Leopold and Loeb to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, Darrow advised his clients to plead guilty, avoiding a trial by jury, which Darrow believed would most certainly have resulted in a conviction and perhaps even the death penalty. The case was heard by Cook County Circuit Court Judge John R. Caverly. During the 12-hour hearing on the final day, Darrow gave a speech that has been called the finest of his career. { -The Clarence Darrow Home Page, The Leopold and Loeb Trial Home Page, Prof. Douglas Linder. Retrieved March 7, 2012. } The speech included the following: &quot; This terrible crime was inherent in his organism, and it came from some ancestor... Is any blame attached because somebody took Nietzsche &apos;s philosophy seriously and fashioned his life upon it?... It is hardly fair to hang a 19-year-old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university. &quot; { John Thomas Scopes, World&apos;s greatest court trial. Cincinnati : National Book Co., 1925, pp. 178-179, 182. } In the end, Darrow succeeded. The judge sentenced Leopold and Loeb each to life imprisonment for the murder and 99 years each for the kidnapping. This was mainly on the grounds that, being under 21, Leopold and Loeb were legal minors. [ Prison and later life ] Leopold and Loeb Initially held at Joliet Prison, Leopold and Loeb were later transferred to Stateville Penitentiary, where they taught classes in the prison school. { Life &amp; Death In Prison by Marilyn Bardsley. Crime Library  — Courtroom Television Network, LLC. Retrieved April 11, 2007. } On January 28, 1936, Loeb was attacked by fellow prisoner James E. Day with a straight razor in a shower room and died from his wounds. Day claimed afterward that Loeb had attempted to sexually assault him. Day emerged without a scratch while Loeb sustained more than 50 wounds from the attack, including numerous self-defense wounds on his arms and hands. Loeb&apos;s throat had also been slashed from behind. { Leopold, Loeb &amp; The Crime of the Century by Hal Higdon, pg 295 } Nevertheless, an inquiry accepted Day&apos;s testimony. The prison authorities, embarrassed by publicity sensationalizing alleged decadent behavior in the prison, { Leopold, Loeb &amp; The Crime of the Century, pg 301 } ruled that Day&apos;s attack on Loeb was in self-defense. According to one widely reported account, newsman Ed Lahey wrote this lead for the Chicago Daily News : &quot; Richard Loeb, despite his erudition, today ended his sentence with a proposition. &quot; [ http://www.poynter.org/dg.lts/id.1/aid.5324/column.htm Ask Dr. Ink Dr. Ink August 23, 2002 Poynter Online ] [ Follett Pub.

Both Leopold and Loeb had been receiving generous allowances from their families, enough to purchase tobacco and various other items for their cellmates and friends. After the warden reduced all prisoner allowances to only a few dollars per month, Day, a former cellmate of Loeb&apos;s, continued to demand the gifts he had been accustomed to receiving, which Loeb could no longer afford. { Leopold, Loeb &amp; The Crime of the Century by Hal Higdon, pg 292 } Nathan Leopold in Stateville Penitentiary, 1931. There is no evidence that Richard Loeb was a sexual predator while in prison; however, Loeb&apos;s murderer was later caught on at least one occasion engaging a fellow inmate sexually { Leopold, Loeb &amp; The Crime of the Century, pg 302 } as well as committing numerous other infractions. In an autobiography entitled Life Plus 99 Years, Leopold referred to Day&apos;s claims that Loeb had attempted to sexually assault him as ridiculous and laughable. This is echoed in an interview with the Catholic chaplain at the prison, Father Eligius Weir, who had been a personal confidante of Richard Loeb. Weir stated that James Day had been the sexual predator and had gone after Loeb because Loeb refused to have sexual relations with him. { Leopold, Loeb &amp; The Crime of the Century, pg 293 } In 1944, Leopold participated in the Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study, in which he volunteered to be infected with malaria. { Leopold, Nathan F., Jr. Life Plus 99 Years. Lowe and Brydone (Printers) Limited, 1958. } Early in 1958, after 33 years in prison, Leopold was released on parole. In April of that year, he set up the Leopold foundation &quot; to aid emotionally disturbed, retarded, or delinquent youths &quot; { Daily Defender; May 29, 1958; p9 } which would be funded by the royalties from his book, Life Plus 99 Years. { Life Plus 99 Years. Intro. By Erle Stanley Gardner, by Leopold, Nathan Freudenthal. Publisher: Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday, 1958. } But in July, the State of Illinois voided his charter for the organization, saying it violated the terms of his parole. { Chicago Daily Tribune, July 16, 1958 p.23 } Leopold moved to Puerto Rico to avoid media attention and married a widowed florist. He was known as &quot; Nate &quot; to neighbors and co-workers at Castañer General Hospital in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico, where he worked as a laboratory and x-ray assistant. { e-mailed comment at www.law.umkc.edu } During this period he was active in the Natural History Society of Puerto Rico, traveling throughout the island to observe its birdlife. In 1963 he published the Checklist of Birds of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. At one time after his release from prison, Leopold talked about his intention to write a book entitled Snatch for a Halo about his life following prison. He never did so. Later, Leopold tried to block the movie Compulsion (see below) on the grounds of invasion of privacy, defamation, and making money from his life story. He died of a diabetes-related heart attack on August 29, 1971, at the age of 66. His cornea s were donated. [ In popular culture ] [ June 2010 ] Leopold and Loeb have been the inspiration for several works in film, theater, and fiction, such as the 1929 play Rope by Patrick Hamilton, which served as the basis for a BBC television performance of this play in 1939, { http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418111 } and Alfred Hitchcock &apos;s film of the same name in 1948. In 1956 Meyer Levin revisited the case in his novel Compulsion, a fictionalized version of the actual events in which the names of the pair were changed to &quot; Steiner and Strauss. &quot; Three years later, the novel was made into a film of the same name, &apos;&apos;Compulsion&apos;&apos;. Never the Sinner, a theatrical recreation of the Leopold and Loeb trial, was written by John Logan in 1988. In Richard Wright&apos;s 1940 novel Native Son, partly set in the same Kenwood neighborhood of Chicago, protagonist Bigger Thomas is inspired by a faint recollection of the Loeb and Leopold case to send a ransom note to the wealthy family of a young girl he has suffocated, a risk that ultimately leads to his own capture. The novel&apos;s conclusion, which centers around the efforts of Bigger&apos;s communist lawyer to convince a judge not to impose capital punishment, may also be inspired by Darrow&apos;s defense of Leopold and Loeb. Other works inspired by the case include Tom Kalin &apos;s more openly gay-themed 1992 film Swoon; Michael Haneke&apos;s 1997 film Funny Games, with an American shot-for-shot remake produced in 2008; 1997&apos;s Kiss the Girls based on the 1995 bestselling novel of the same name by American writer James Patterson; Barbet Schroeder &apos;s Murder by Numbers (2002); and Stephen Dolginoff &apos;s 2005 Off-Broadway musical Thrill Me: The Leopold and Loeb Story; and various TV episodes (including on Law &amp; Order SVU ). Nathan Leopold, Jr. is featured as a character in Nicky Silver &apos;s Off Broadway comedy The Agony &amp; The Agony, despite the play&apos;s being set in 2006. Leopold and Loeb are mentioned twice in the television show Gilmore Girls. First in a season-one episode titled &quot; Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers &quot;, where Lorelai is set up on a blind date with a man who had two dobermans as a child named Leopold and Loeb. Second in a season-three episode titled &quot; Those Lay-Hazy-Crazy Days &quot;, Lorelai has a dream about having twins and plans to name them Leopold and Loeb. The Leopold and Loeb case is a theme in Daniel Clowes &apos; 2005 graphic novel Ice Haven, which includes a short story about the criminal duo as well as references to the incident in other stories. In &quot; Mad Men, &quot; Season 2, Episode 3, Donald Draper snidely refers to two other admen as &quot; Leopold and Loeb. &quot; Clarence Darrow&apos;s speech during the Leopold and Loeb case was mentioned twice in the TV show The Practice, in season 6 and season 7.
