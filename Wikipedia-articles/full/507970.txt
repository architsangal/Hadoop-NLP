As of 2006, it has a circulation of 3.75 million and revenue expected to top $1.5 billion. { People who need people, a July 2006 article from } { Variety magazine. } It was named &quot; Magazine of the Year &quot; by Advertising Age in October 2005, for excellence in editorial, circulation and advertising. { Martha Nelson Named Editor, The People Group, a January 2006 } { Time Warner press release. } People ranked #6 on Advertising Age&apos;s annual &quot; A-list &quot; and #3 on Adweek &apos;s &quot; Brand Blazers &quot; list in October 2006. The magazine runs a roughly 50/50 mix of celebrity and human-interest articles. People&apos;s editors claim to refrain from printing pure celebrity gossip, enough so to lead celebrity publicists to propose exclusives to the magazine, evidence of what one staffer calls a &quot; publicist-friendly strategy &quot;. People&apos;s website, People.com, focuses exclusively on celebrity news. In February 2007, the website drew 39.6 million page views &quot; within a day &quot; of the Golden Globes. However &quot; the mother ship of Oscar coverage &quot; broke a site record with 51.7 million page views on the day after the Oscars, beating the previous record set just a month before from the Golden Globes. [ Old Media Partying With Oscar Online Katharine Q. Seelye http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/19/business/media/19oscars.html The New York Times 19 February 2007 3 July 2011 ] { &lt; Media Industry News letter, March 2006 &gt; } [ July 2011 ] People is perhaps best known for its yearly special issues naming &quot; Most Beautiful People &quot;, &quot; The Best Dressed &quot;, and &quot; The Sexiest Man Alive &quot;. The magazine maintains a single editorial bureau in Los Angeles. Due to economic reasons it has recently closed bureaus in New York City, Austin, Miami, Chicago, and London. [ History ] The concept for People has been attributed to Andrew Heiskell, Time, Inc.’s chief executive officer at the time and the former publisher of the weekly &apos;&apos;LIFE&apos;&apos; magazine. The founding managing editor of People was Richard B. (Dick) Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at LIFE and the journalist who acquired the Zapruder tapes of the John F. Kennedy assassination for Time, Inc. in 1963. People’s first publisher was Richard J. (Dick) Durrell, another Time, Inc. veteran. Stolley characterized the magazine as &quot; getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues. &quot; [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C944778%2C00.html Time The Press: PEOPLE&apos;S PREMIERE 1974-03-04 ] Stolley’s almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time, Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premiere March 4, 1974 edition featured actress Mia Farrow, then starring in the movie The Great Gatsby, on the cover. That issue also featured stories on Gloria Vanderbilt, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action. The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents. The core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from the weekly LIFE magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of ESPN anchor Trey Wingo ), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of &apos;&apos;Us&apos;&apos; magazine ), and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate Mitt Romney ); former Time senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of Time’s ill-fated cable television magazine View); Chief of Photography, a LIFE photographer, John Loengard, to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy LIFE staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the “Lyle The Crocodile” book series for children. Many of the noteworthy LIFE photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends Alfred Eisenstaedt and Gjon Mili and rising stars Co Rentmeester, David Burnett and Bill Eppridge. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers: Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, and Jed Horne, later an editor of The Times-Picayune in New Orleans. In 1996 Time, Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled People en Español. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the slain Tejano singer Selena and the other featuring the hit television series Friends; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not. { &quot; Grad Named Head of &apos;&apos;People en Español&apos;&apos;. &quot; tufts.edu. February 29, 2004. } Though the original idea was that Spanish-language translations of articles from the English magazine would comprise half the content of People en Español over time came to have entirely original content. [ http://www.articlecat.com/Article/People-En-Espanol--Spanish-Magazine/161992 People En Espanol: Spanish Magazine Articlecat.com 15 January 2011 ] In 2002, People introduced People Stylewatch, a title focusing on celebrity style, fashion, and beauty – a newsstand extension of its Stylewatch column. Due to its success, the frequency of People Stylewatch was increased to 10 times per year in 2007. In Australia, the localized version of People is titled Who because of a pre-existing lad&apos;s mag published under the title People. [ Teen People ] [ Teen People Nickteenpeople.jpg 200px Teen People April 2006 Monthly Christina Ferrari Barbara O&apos;Dair Managing Editor Celebrity Time Inc. ( Time Warner ) English 1998 September, 2006 United States ] In 1998, the magazine introduced a version targeted at teens called Teen People. However, on July 27, 2006, the company announced it would shut down publication of Teen People immediately. The last issue to be released was scheduled for September 2006. { &quot; Teen People magazine closes, but website will still continue. &quot; New York Times. July 26, 2006. } Subscribers to this magazine received Entertainment Weekly for the rest of their issues in exchange. There were numerous reasons cited for the publication shutdown, including a downfall in ad pages, competition from both other teen-oriented magazines and the internet along with a decrease in circulation numbers.

People.com will &quot; carry teen-focused stories that are branded as TeenPeople.com &quot;, Mark Golin the editor of People.com explained, with the decision to merge the brands, &quot; We&apos;ve got traffic on TeenPeople, People is a larger site, why not combine and have the teen traffic going to one place? &quot; [ http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id%3D1003570645 TeenPeople.com to Merge Into People.com Mediaweek.com April 11, 2007 15 January 2011 ] [ Competition for celebrity photos ] In a July 2006 Variety article, Janice Min, Us Weekly editor-in-chief, blamed People for the increase in cost to publishers of celebrity photos: &quot; They are among the largest spenders of celebrity photos in the industry....One of the first things they ever did, that led to the jacking up of photo prices, was to pay $75,000 to buy pictures of Jennifer Lopez reading Us magazine, so Us Weekly couldn&apos;t buy them. &quot; That was the watershed moment that kicked off high photo prices in my mind. I had never seen anything like it. But they saw a competitor come along, and responded. It was a business move, and probably a smart one. &quot; People reportedly paid $4.1 million for newborn photos of Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, the child of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. The photos set a single-day traffic record for their website, attracting 26.5 million page views. [ Sexiest Man Alive ] The annual feature the &quot; Sexiest Man Alive &quot; is billed as a benchmark of male attractiveness and typically includes only famous people and celebrities. It is determined in a similar procedure to &apos;&apos;Time&apos;&apos; &apos;s Person of the Year. The origin of the title was a discussion on a planned story on Mel Gibson. A female editor exclaimed, &quot; Oh my God, he is the sexiest man alive! &quot; And someone else said, &quot; You should use that as a cover line. &quot; { Argetsinger, Amy; Roberts, Roxanne. &quot; Matt Damon??!!! We Demand to Differ! &quot; The Washington Post. November 19, 2007. Retrieved 2008-01-31. } For the first decade or so, the feature appeared at uneven intervals. Originally awarded in the wintertime, it shifted around the calendar, resulting in gaps as short as seven months and as long as a year and a half (with no selection at all during 1994). Since 1997, the dates have settled between mid-November and early December. Dates of magazine issues, winners, ages of winners at the time of selection, and pertinent comments are listed below. As of 2012, John F. Kennedy, Jr. and Patrick Swayze are the only winners to have died since winning.
