[ History ] [ History of Mobile, Alabama ] [ Colonial ] The European settlement of Mobile, then known as Fort Louis de la Louisiane, started in 1702, at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the Mobile River, as the first capital of the French colony of Louisiana. It was founded by French Canadian brothers Pierre Le Moyne d&apos;Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, to establish control over France&apos;s Louisiana claims. Bienville was made governor of French Louisiana in 1701. Mobile&apos;s Roman Catholic parish was established on 20 July 1703, by Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec. { Higginbotham, Jay.

In 1704 the ship &apos;&apos;Pélican&apos;&apos; delivered 23 French women to the colony, along with yellow fever which passengers had contracted at a stop in Havana. { Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city,pages 20–21. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 } Though most of the &quot; Pélican girls &quot; recovered, numerous colonists and neighboring Native Americans died from the illness. This early period was also the occasion of the arrival of the first African slaves, transported aboard a French supply ship from Saint-Domingue. The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708, yet descending to 178 persons two years later due to disease. Mobile and Fort Condé in 1725. These additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods caused Bienville to order the town relocated several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the Mobile River and Mobile Bay in 1711. { Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city,pages 17–27. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001.

The capital of Louisiana was moved to Biloxi in 1720, leaving Mobile in the role of military and trading center. In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began and it was renamed Fort Condé in honor of Louis Henri, Duc de Bourbon and prince of Condé. [ Historic Fort Conde &quot; Museum of Mobile &quot; http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php 2007-10-18 ] In 1763, the Treaty of Paris was signed, ending the French and Indian War. The treaty ceded Mobile and the surrounding territory to Great Britain, and it was made a part of the expanded British West Florida colony. [ Early European Conquests and the Settlement of Mobile &quot; Alabama Department of Archives and History &quot; http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec02qs.html 2007-10-20 ] The British changed the name of Fort Condé to Fort Charlotte, after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, King George III&apos;s queen. [ Mobile: Alabama&apos;s Tricentennial City &quot; Alabama Department of Archives and History &quot; http://www.archives.state.al.us/mobile/mobile3.html 2007-10-20 ] The British were eager not to lose any useful inhabitants and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists, ultimately 112 French Mobilians remained in the colony. { Thomason, Michael. Mobile: the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city,pages 44–45. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 } The first permanent Jewish presence in Mobile began in 1763 as a result of the new religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir, a decree passed by France&apos;s King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France&apos;s colonies. Most of these colonial era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders, and added to the commercial development of Mobile. { Zietz, Robert (1994).

During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies. { Delaney, Caldwell. The Story of Mobile, page 45. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN 0-940882-14-0 } While the British were dealing with their rebellious colonists along the Atlantic coast, the Spanish entered the war as an ally of France in 1779. They took the opportunity to order Bernardo de Galvez, Governor of Louisiana, on an expedition east to retake Florida [ The Fort Barrancas Story David P. Ogden Eastern National Parks 978-1-888213-15-7 2 ] and captured Mobile during the Battle of Fort Charlotte in 1780 as part of this campaign. They wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony, which they had received from France in the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Their actions were also condoned by the revolting American colonies, as evidenced by the presence of Oliver Pollack, representative of the American Continental Congress, and because West Florida, for the most part, remained loyal to the British Crown. The fort was renamed Fortaleza Carlota, with the Spanish holding Mobile as a part of Spanish West Florida until 1813, when it was seized by the U.S. General James Wilkinson during the War of 1812.

[ Thomason Michael Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city 65 Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 2001 0-8173-1065-7 ] The city was included in the Alabama Territory in 1817, after Mississippi gained statehood. Alabama was granted statehood in 1819; Mobile&apos;s population had increased to 809 by that time. As the river frontage areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by farmers and the plantation economy became established, Mobile&apos;s population exploded. It came to be settled by merchants, attorneys, mechanics, doctors and others seeking to capitalize on trade with these upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city&apos;s population was 2800. From the 1830s onward, Mobile expanded into a city of commerce with a primary focus on the cotton trade. [ Thomason Michael Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city 69–71 Tuscaloosa, Alabama University of Alabama Press 2001 0-8173-1065-7 ] The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation. With the economy so focused on one crop, Mobile&apos;s fortunes were always tied to those of cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises. Though Mobile had a relatively small slave-owning population compared to the inland plantation areas, it was the slave-trading center of the state until surpassed by Montgomery in the 1850s. [ Thomason Michael Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city 79–80 Tuscaloosa, Alabama University of Alabama Press 2001 0-8173-1065-7 ] By 1853, there were fifty Jewish families living in Mobile, including Philip Phillips, an attorney who was elected to the Alabama State Legislature and then to the United States Congress. { Zietz, Robert (1994).

Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city, page 113. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 } On 12 April 1865, 3 days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse, the city of Mobile surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction following the Union victories at the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakely. Ironically, on 25 May 1865, the city suffered loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a federal ammunition depot on Beauregard Street. The explosion left a [ 30 ft m 0 on ] deep hole at the depot&apos;s location, sunk ships docked on the Mobile River, and the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city. { Delaney, Caldwell.

ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 } The last quarter of the 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile&apos;s exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3  million in 1882. { Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city, page 145.

ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 } The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels in the harbor. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile&apos;s economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important. Van Antwerp Building, completed in 1907 During this time, social justice and race relations in Mobile worsened, however. In 1902 the city government passed Mobile&apos;s first segregation ordinance, one that segregated the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile&apos;s African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile&apos;s de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain dominance. The red imported fire ant was first introduced into the United States via the Port of Mobile. Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off of South American cargo ships, where they lived in the soil used as ballast on those ships. { http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/documents/FACT/RedImportedFireAntsJusttheFacts-Sep2007.pdf } World War II led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile&apos;s population, largely due to the massive influx of workers coming to Mobile to work in the shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field. { Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city, pages 213–217. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 } Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries. Mobile was one of eighteen U.S. cities producing Liberty ships. Its Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them. Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation, focused on building freighters, Fletcher class destroyer s, and minesweepers. The years after World War II brought about changes in Mobile&apos;s social structure and economy. Instead of shipbuilding being a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand, and most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, African Americans stepped up their efforts to achieve equal rights and social justice. Some residents of Mobile had considered the city to be tolerant and racially accommodating compared to other cities in the South, especially as the police force and Spring Hill College were integrated in the 1950s. Buses and lunch counters were voluntarily desegregated by the early 1960s. Mobile&apos;s African-American citizens were not as content with the status quo as such residents believed. In 1963 three African-American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. { Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama&apos;s first city, pages 260–261. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 } The court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County&apos;s school system. The Civil Rights Movement led to the end of legal racial segregation with passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. { RSA Battle House Tower and } { RSA–BankTrust Building. } In the late 1960s, Mobile&apos;s economy was dealt a blow with the closing of Brookley Air Force Base. This and other factors ushered in a period of economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The Alabama legislature passed the Cater Act in 1949 allowing cities and counties to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile&apos;s first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was the driving force behind its creation. The existing Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, considering itself better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, saw the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally&apos;s IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions. { Bill Patterson, &quot; The Founding of the Industrial Development Board of the City of Mobile: The Port City&apos;s Reluctant Use of Subsidies &quot;, Gulf South Historical Review 2000 15(2): 21–40, } Beginning in the late 1980s, the new mayor, Mike Dow, and the city council began an effort termed the &quot; String of Pearls Initiative &quot; to make Mobile into a competitive city. [ Mobile Wins Title of All American City &quot; City of Mobile &quot; http://www.cityofmobile.org/mapsnfacts/all_america.php 2007-11-15 ] The city initiated construction of numerous new facilities and projects, and the restoration of hundreds of historic downtown buildings and homes.
