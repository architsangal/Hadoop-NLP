[ Wołyń the Polish village Wołyń, Łódź Voivodeship ] Volhynia { Lubart&apos;s Castle was the seat of the medieval princes of Volhynia. } Volhynia, Volynia, or Volyn ( [ Волинь ], [ Волы́нь ], [ Wołyń ], [ Voluinė ] or Volynė, [ Wolhynien ] or Wolynien, [ װאָהלין, Vohlin ] ) is a historic region straddling Poland and Russia. It was annexed after the Second World War into the Soviet Union as Ukraine pushed its borders westwards replacing the Polish and Jewish populations, and, since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, it now forms a part of western Ukraine. It is located between the rivers Prypiat and Southern Bug, to the north of Galicia and Podolia. The region is named for the former city of Volyn or Velyn, said to have been located on the Southern Bug River, whose name may come from the Proto-Slavic root *vol/vel- &apos;wet.&apos; { E.M. Pospelov, Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira (Moscow, 1998), p. 104. } In addition to Poles, Russians and Ukrainians, the region historically had one of the biggest Jewish populations in the world, almost all of whom were murdered in the Holocaust, or in pre-war pogroms by Ukrainian and Polish nationalists. Territories of historical Volhynia now form the Volyn, Rivne, and parts of Zhytomyr, Ternopil and Khmelnytskyi Oblast s of Ukraine, as well as parts of Poland (see Chełm ). Major cities include Lutsk, Kovel, Kremenets (Ternopil Oblast), Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and Starokostiantyniv (Khmelnytskyi Oblast). Many Jewish shtetl s (villages) like Trochenbrod and Lozisht were once an integral part of the region.

Volhynia&apos;s early history coincides with that of the duchies or principalities of Halych and Volodymyr-Volynskyi. These two successor states of the Kievan Rus formed Halych-Volhynia between the 12th and the 14th centuries. { Pochayiv Lavra, the spiritual heart of the } { Orthodox in Volhynia. } After the disintegration of the Grand Duchy of Halych-Volhynia (also called Galich-Vladimir Rus) circa 1340, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania divided up the region between them, Poland taking Western Volhynia and Lithuania Eastern Volhynia (1352–1366). After 1569 Volhynia formed a province of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During this period Poles and Jew s settled in the area. The Roman and Greek Catholic churches became established in the province, and many Orthodox churches were forcibly annexed by the latter. Records of the first agricultural colonies of Mennonite s date from 1783. After the Third partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795 Volhynia became the Volhynian Governorate of the Russian Empire and covered an area of 71,852.7 square kilometers. In the year of 1897 its population amounted to 2,989,482 souls (41.7 per square kilometer) and consisted of 73.7 percent Russians (predominantly Ukrainians ), 13.2 percent Jews, 6.2 percent Poles, and 5.7 percent Germans. { Meyers Konversations-Lexikon. 6th edition, Vol. 20, Leipzig and Vienna 1909, pp. 744-745. } Most of the German settlers had immigrated from Congress Poland. A small number of Czech settlers also had arrived. Although economically the area was developing rather quickly, upon the eve of the First World War it was still the most rural province in Western Russia. { Ostroh was endowed by the } { Ostrogski princes in the 15th century. } In 1921, after the end of the Polish-Soviet war, the treaty known as the Peace of Riga divided Volhynia between Poland and the Soviet Union. Poland took the larger part and established a Volhynian Voivodeship. Most of eastern Volhynia became part of the Zhytomyr Oblast. From 1935-38 Joseph Stalin had the Poles of Eastern Volhynia deported in what became the first ethnic deportation in the Soviet history. Following the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, and the subsequent invasion and division of Polish territories between the Reich and the USSR, Volhynia was occupied by the Soviet Union. In the course of the Nazi-Soviet population transfers which followed this German-Soviet reconciliation, most of the German minority population of Volhynia were transferred to Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany. During the war the Ukrainians exterminated a large part of the local Polish population (see Massacre of Poles in Volhynia ). Ethnic Germans in these areas were expelled from these areas starting in 1945. Volhynia was annexed to Soviet Ukraine after the end of World War II. Most of the remaining ethnic Polish population were expelled to Poland in 1945 (see Recovered Territories ). Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Volhynia has been an integral part of Ukraine.
