Retrieved: 19 December 2007. } On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb as a weapon of war. The bomb, code-named &quot; Little Boy &quot;, was targeted at the city of Hiroshima, Japan, and caused extensive destruction. The Enola Gay gained additional attention in 1995 when the cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited during the bombing&apos;s 50th anniversary at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) of the Smithsonian Institution in downtown Washington, D.C. The exhibit was changed due to a controversy over original historical script displayed with the aircraft. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM&apos;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. [ World War II ] The Enola Gay (B-29-45-MO, AAF Serial Number 44-86292, Victor number 82) was built by the Glenn L. Martin Company (now Lockheed Martin ) at its Bellevue, Nebraska, plant, at what is now known as Offutt Air Force Base, and was one of 15 B-29s with the &quot; Silverplate &quot; modifications necessary to deliver atomic weapons, which included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors, special propellors, modified engines { March, Peter R. &quot; Enola Gay Restored &quot;. Aircraft Illustrated, October 2003. } and the deletion of protective armor and gun turrets. Enola Gay was personally selected by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., commander of the 509th Composite Group, on 9 May 1945, while still on the assembly line. { &quot; Boeing B-29 Enola Gay Superfortress bomber, Aircraft history, facts and pictures. &quot; aviationexplorer.com. Retrieved: 4 August 2010. } The aircraft was accepted by the USAAF on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, 509th Composite Group. { Knaack, Marcelle Size. Post-World War II Bombers, 1945–1973. Washington: Office of Air Force History, 1988. ISBN 0-16-002260-6. } Crew B-9 (Captain Robert A. Lewis, aircraft commander) took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509th&apos;s base at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah on 14 June 1945. Thirteen days later, the aircraft left Wendover for Guam, where it received a bomb bay modification and flew to North Field, Tinian on 6 July. It was originally given the Victor (squadron-assigned identification) number &quot; 12, &quot; but on 1 August, was given the circle R tail markings of the 6th Bomb Group as a security measure and had its Victor changed to &quot; 82 &quot; to avoid misidentification with actual 6th BG aircraft. During July of that year, after the bomber flew eight training missions and two combat missions to drop pumpkin bomb s on industrial targets at Kobe and Nagoya, Enola Gay was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission. The partially assembled Little Boy combat weapon L-11 was contained inside a 41” x 47” x 138” wood crate weighing [ 10000 lb ] that was secured to the deck of the USS Indianapolis. Unlike the six U-235 target discs, which were later flown to Tinian on three separate aircraft arriving 28 and 29 July, the assembled projectile with the nine U-235 rings installed was shipped in a single lead-lined steel container weighing [ 300 lb ] that was securely locked to brackets welded to the deck of Captain Charles McVay’s quarters. ( [ The atomic bombs were euphemistically known as the &quot; gadgets &quot;, a tag given to them by scientists at the Los Alamos test facility. Hoddeson et al. 1993, p. 2.

It is in its 6th BG livery, victor number 82 visible on fuselage just forward of the tail fin. On 5 August 1945, during preparation for the first atomic mission, pilot Colonel Paul Tibbets who assumed command of the aircraft, named the B-29 aircraft after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets (1893–1983), who had been named for the heroine of a novel ( [ Enola; or Her fatal mistake(1886), by Mary Young Ridenbaugh is the only novel of the period to use &quot; Enola &quot;.

According to Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts, { Thomas 1977. } regularly assigned aircraft commander Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now famous nose art. { Campbell 2005, pp. 191–192. } Tibbets himself, interviewed on Tinian later that day by war correspondents, confessed that he was a bit embarrassed at having attached his mother&apos;s name to such a fateful mission. { Murphy, Charles J.V. &quot; Carl Spaatz: A Register of His Papers in the Library of Congress. &quot; Library of Congress. Retrieved: 4 August 2010. } The Hiroshima mission was described by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan Witts in their book, Enola Gay as tactically flawless. Enola Gay returned safely to its base on Tinian to great fanfare. The Enola Gay was accompanied by two other B-29s, Necessary Evil which was used to carry scientific observers, and as a camera plane to photograph the explosion and effects of the bomb and The Great Artiste instrumented for blast measurement. { Campbell 2005, p. 219. } The first atomic bombing was followed three days later by another B-29 ( Bockscar ) { &quot; Boeing B-29 Superfortress. &quot; National Museum of the United States air Force. Retrieved: 3 August 2010. } (piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney ) which dropped a second nuclear weapon, &quot; Fat Man &quot;, on Nagasaki. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution, and Bockscar had very little fuel by the time it landed on Okinawa. { Rossenfeld, Carrie. &quot; The Story of Nagasaki: The Missions. &quot; hiroshima-remembered.com, 2005.

On 29 April 1946, Enola Gay left Roswell as part of Operation Crossroads and flew to Kwajalein on 1 May. It was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll and left Kwajalein on 1 July, the date of the test, and reached Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field, California, the next day. The decision was made to preserve the Enola Gay, and on 24 July 1946, the aircraft was flown to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, in preparation for storage. On 30 August 1946, the title to the aircraft was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution and the Enola Gay was removed from the USAAF inventory. From 1946 to 1961, the Enola Gay was put into temporary storage at a number of locations: 1 September 1946: Davis-Monthan AFB. 3 July 1949: Orchard Place Air Field, Park Ridge, Illinois, flown there by Brig Gen Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian. 12 January 1952: Pyote Air Force Base, Texas, moved after O&apos;Hare International Airport &apos;s location was announced. 2 December 1953: Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. 10 August 1960: disassembly at Andrews AFB begun by personnel of the Smithsonian. 21 July 1961: components transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland.

Retrieved: 4 August 2010. } The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit in order to meet the satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. { Dubin, Steven C. &apos;&apos;Displays of Power: Controversy in the American Museum from the Enola Gay to Sensation.&apos;&apos; New York: NYU Press, 2001.

While the fuselage was on display, from 1995 to 1998, work continued on the remaining unrestored components. The aircraft was shipped in pieces to the National Air and Space Museum&apos;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia from March–June 2003, with the fuselage and wings reunited for the first time since 1960 on 10 April 2003 and assembly completed on 8 August 2003.

The aircraft is shielded by various means to prevent a repetition of the vandalism that was attempted when it was first placed on display. A video analytics system was installed in 2005 and multiple surveillance cameras automatically generate an alarm when any person or object approaches the aircraft.
