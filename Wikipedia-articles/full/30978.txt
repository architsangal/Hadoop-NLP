Formed in 1990, the group&apos;s line-up has included drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Since 1995, Justin Chancellor has been the band&apos;s bassist, replacing their original bassist Paul D&apos;Amour. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.The band emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album Undertow in 1993, and later became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their second effort, Ænima, in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and commercial success around the world. Due to Tool&apos;s incorporation of visual arts and relatively long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock and art rock. The relationship between the band and today&apos;s music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship and the band members&apos; insistence on privacy.

Jones explained that it doesn&apos;t contain a storyline, but that his intentions were to summon personal emotions with its imagery. Rolling Stone described this imagery by stating that, in the video, &quot; evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat coursing through pipes in the wall &quot; and called it a &quot; groundbreaking &quot;, &quot; epic &quot; clip.

The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the Associated Press attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging. Both Ænima { Akhtar, D11. } and 10,000 Days were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. As art director, Adam Jones created packaging for 10,000 Days that features a pair of stereoscopic lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones has been a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography and expressed a desire for the packaging to be unique and to reflect the &apos;70s artwork he appreciates.

Breckinridge Haggerty, the band&apos;s live video director, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage &quot; are mostly for Maynard &quot;. He explains, &quot; [a] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he’s trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows. &quot; The big screens are used to play back &quot; looped clips that aren’t tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They’ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised.... The show is never the same twice. &quot; As of 2010, Andres Abrego is their new live video director. During the 10,000 Days tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Adam Jones, his wife Camella Grace, Chet Zar, Meats Meier and Breckinridge Haggerty.
