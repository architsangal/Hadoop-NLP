The show is a free flowing conversation about the week&apos;s news, happenings in the lives of the hosts and their families, and restaurant reviews from the dinners John and Adam have together when they are in the same city (usually San Francisco). Adam usually has more outlandish opinions of the week&apos;s news or world events while Dvorak is intended to play the straight man in the dialogue.

Then it can wash its hands of any marketplace failures.
