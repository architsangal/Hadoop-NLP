He left masterpieces of poetic short stories such as &quot; The Lemon &quot;, &quot; Winter Days &quot;, and &quot; Under the Cherry Trees &quot;. An obscure writer all his short life, his stories were praised by Kawabata in several articles, and today his works are appreciated for their finely tuned self-observation and descriptive power. As short his lifetime and body of work were, Kajii left a modest footprint on Japan&apos;s culture. His story &quot; Lemon &quot; being a staple of textbooks, many a high schooler emulated its protagonist&apos;s act of leaving a lemon in a department store. { &quot;  I read an article about Maruzen closing its business in yesterday&apos;s Asahi Journal Evening Edition. It claims that many people are leaving lemons in the department store, just like the main character in Motojiro Kajii&apos;s short story titled LEMON. Coincidentally, I learned that many people are buying LEMON from the bookstore inside Maruzen. LEMON is featured in school textbooks; there aren&apos;t many Japanese who don&apos;t know the story. I am fond of the story myself. I learned the name Maruzen for the first time through LEMON. To be perfectly honest... I left a lemon in Maruzen when I was a high school student. My friend did the same. It must have been a nuisance for the people who worked there.   &quot; – } { Hideo Kojima (creator of the } { Metal Gear Solid video games for } { Konami ), in the Sunday, 2 October 2005 entry of his English blog ( } { Archive.org copy) } { &quot;  On October 10th Maruzen will close their Kyoto shop which is associated with this novel Lemon. After they announced their closure, store staff found lemons on the books. They had lemons before a few times in a year, but this year they have found 11 lemons already.   &quot; – Mari Kanazawa (notable Tokyo blogger), in the Monday, October 03, 2005 entry &quot; A lemon on books &quot; of her English blog &quot; Watashi to Tokyo - Me and Tokyo &quot; } And his opening sentence [ &quot;  Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees!   &quot; 桜の樹の下には屍体が埋まっている！ Sakura no ki no shita ni wa shitai ga umatte iru! ] is often quoted by Japanese people { &quot; Why is the Cherry Blossom (Sakura) cherished? &quot; } about the cherry-blossoms-watching custom of hanami.

At this time, he visited the famous writer Yasunari Kawabata and they became friends, playing go together { (op. cit.) Kajii &amp; Kodama de Larroche, Le citron, p. 13 } several times a week. After Aozora stopped publishing in 1927, he wrote in Bungei Toshi (文芸都市; &quot; The Literary City &quot; ), another literary coterie magazine.
