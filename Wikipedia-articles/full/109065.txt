The population was 6,505 at the 2000 census. Residents of the unincorporated community voted in late 2004 to join the city of Pompano Beach, Florida. [ History ] The area was developed with single-family homes beginning in the mid-1950s. Developer Mackle Company and architect James Vensel laid out a community with 4 basic home types on lots averaging 75 x 100 ft. The homes were single-story concrete block structures with large windows and open-plan interiors. The exterior details were kept to a minimum, but certain models had stylish space-age touches. The &quot; Lime Beach &quot; model had staggered roof gables at one end lending a geometric flair to an otherwise rectangular box. The developers marketed the houses nationally, with ads in magazines such as Life. 1 Low prices and small down payments enticed many retirees to purchase homes sight unseen via mail.
