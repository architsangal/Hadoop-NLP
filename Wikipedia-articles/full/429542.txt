The cause for preterm birth is in many situations elusive and unknown; many factors appear to be associated with the development of preterm birth, making the reduction of preterm birth a challenging proposition. Premature birth, commonly used as a synonym for preterm birth, refers to the birth of a baby before the developing organs are mature enough to allow normal postnatal survival. Premature infants are at greater risk for short and long term complications, including disabilities and impediments in growth and mental development. Significant progress has been made in the care of premature infants, but not in reducing the prevalence of preterm birth. Preterm birth is among the top causes of death in infants worldwide. [ September 2010 ] [ Classification ] In that they continue developing after birth, most animals are not born mature. At birth, a normal human infant is less mature than infants of some other primate species, possibly to allow the disproportionately large head to fit through a pelvis adapted for walking on two legs. Furthermore, since the evolution of conscious thought in humans, there is less selective pressure to have more developed infants at birth because of the increased ability to protect human infants. [ October 2011 ] In humans whereas the usual definition of preterm birth is birth before 37 complete weeks of gestational age, [ Steer P 2005 The epidemiology of preterm labour British Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 112 Suppl 1 1–3 15715585 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00575.x ] a &quot; premature &quot; infant is one that has not yet reached the level of fetal development that generally allows life outside the womb. In the normal human fetus, several organ systems mature between 34 and 37 weeks, and the fetus reaches adequate maturity by the end of this period. One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to develop in the womb; because of this, premature babies typically spend the first days/weeks of their life on a ventilator. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature. Prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth. [ Signs and symptoms ] Symptoms of imminent spontaneous preterm birth, are signs of premature labor; one sign is four or more uterine contraction s in one hour. In contrast to false labor, true labor is accompanied by cervical dilatation and effacement. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection ( chorioamnionitis ) is a serious threat to both fetus and mother. In some cases the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process. [ Mortality and morbidity ] The shorter the term of pregnancy, the greater the risks of mortality and morbidity for the baby primarily due to the related prematurity. Preterm-premature babies ( &quot; preemies &quot; or &quot; premmies &quot; ) have an increased risk of death in the first year of life ( infant mortality ), with most of that occurring in the first month of life ( neonatal mortality ). Worldwide, prematurity accounts for 10% of neonatal mortality, or around 500,000 deaths per year. [ 1999 Reducing Perinatal and Neonatal Mortality Child Health Research Project Special Report ] In the U.S. where many infections and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%. [ Mathew TJ, MacDorman MF 2006 Infant Mortality Statistics from the 2003 Period Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set National Vital Statistics Reports 54 16 ] Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk for having subsequent serious chronic health problems as discussed below. The earliest gestational age at which the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is referred to as the limit of viability. As NICU care has improved over the last 40 years, viability has reduced to approximately 24 weeks, [ Kaempf JW, Tomlinson M, Arduza C, et al. 2006 Medical staff guidelines for periviability pregnancy counseling and medical treatment of extremely premature infants Pediatrics 117 1 22–29 16396856 10.1542/peds.2004-2547 http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/1/22 ] {  — in particular see TABLE 1 Survival and Neurologic Disability Rates Among Extremely Premature Infants } [ Morgan MA, Goldenberg RL, Schulkin J 2008 Obstetrician-gynecologists&apos; practices regarding preterm birth at the limit of viability Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine 21 2 115–121 18240080 10.1080/14767050701866971 ] although rare survivors have been documented as early as 21 weeks. This date is controversial, as gestation in the case reported was measured from the known date of conception (by IVF) rather than, as usual, the date of the mother&apos;s last menstrual period, making gestation appear two weeks less than if calculated by the conventional method in this case. [ James SD 2007 Life at 21 weeks:Immature Lungs and a Handful of Fragile Skin and Pain http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id%3D2890242%26amp%3Bpage%3D1 ABC News 2008-12-16 ] As risk of brain damage and developmental delay is significant at that threshold even if the infant survives, there are ethical controversies over the aggressiveness of the care rendered to such infants. The limit of viability has also become a factor in the abortion debate [ March 2010 ]. [ Specific risks for the preterm neonate ] Preterm infants usually show physical signs of prematurity in reverse proportion to the gestational age. As a result they are at risk for numerous medical problems affecting different organ systems. Neurological problems include apnea of prematurity, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), developmental disability, transient hyperammonemia of the newborn, cerebral palsy and intraventricular hemorrhage, the latter affecting 25 percent of babies born preterm, usually before 32 weeks of pregnancy. March of Dimes -- &gt; Neonatal Death Retrieved on September 2, 2009 Mild brain bleeds usually leave no or few lasting complications, but severe bleeds often result in brain damage or even death. Neurodevelopmental problems have been linked to lack of maternal thyroid hormone s, at a time when their own thyroid is unable to meet postnatal needs.

[ 1 ] Respiratory problems are common, specifically the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS or IRDS) (previously called hyaline membrane disease). Another problem can be chronic lung disease (previously called bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD). Gastrointestinal and metabolic issues can arise from hypoglycemia, feeding difficulties, rickets of prematurity, hypocalcemia, inguinal hernia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Hematologic complications include anemia of prematurity, thrombocytopenia, and hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice) that can lead to kernicterus. Infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection A large study on children born between 22 and 25 weeks who were currently at school age found that 46 percent had severe or moderate disabilities such as cerebral palsy, vision or hearing loss and learning problems. 34 percent were mildly disabled and 20 percent had no disabilities, while 12 percent had disabling cerebral palsy. [ http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6790571/ns/health-kids_and_parenting/ Extreme preemies face long-term disabilities ] { Kapiolani Medical Center NICU in Honolulu, Hawaii } [ Causes ] As the cause of labor still remains elusive, the exact cause of preterm birth is also unsolved. In fact, the cause of 50% of preterm births is never determined. Labor is a complex process involving many factors. Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension, decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection. [ Simhan HN, Caritis SN 2007 Prevention of Preterm Delivery New England Journal of Medicine 357 5 477–487 17671256 10.1056/NEJMra050435 ] Activation of one or more of these pathways may happen gradually over weeks, even months. From a practical point a number of factors have been identified that are associated with preterm birth, however, an association does not establish causality. [ Maternal background ] A number of factors have been identified that are linked to a higher risk of a preterm birth: age at the upper and lower end of the reproductive years, be it more than 35 [ Martius JA, Steck T, Oehler MK, Wulf KH 1998 Risk factors associated with preterm ( &lt; 37+0 weeks) and early preterm birth ( &lt; 32+0 weeks): univariate and multivariate analysis of 106 345 singleton births from the 1994 statewide perinatal survey of Bavaria European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 80 2 183–189 9846665 10.1016/S0301-2115(98)00130-4 ] or less than 18 years of age. Maternal height and weight can also play a role. [ Merck Risk factors present before pregnancy http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch258/ch258b.html Merck Manual Home Edition Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme ] Further, in the US and the UK, black women have preterm birth rates of 15–18%, more than double than that of the white population. This discrepancy is not seen in comparison to Asian or Hispanic immigrants and remains unexplained. Pregnancy interval makes a difference as women with a 6 months span or less between pregnancies have a two-fold increase in preterm birth. [ Smith GC, Pell JP, Dobbie R 2003 Interpregnancy interval and risk of preterm birth and neonatal death: retrospective cohort study British Medical Journal 327 7410 313 12907483 169644 10.1136/bmj.327.7410.313 ] Studies on type of work and physical activity have given conflicting results, but it is opined that stressful conditions, hard labor, and long hours are probably linked to preterm birth. Women who have undergone previous surgically induced abortion s have been shown to have a higher risk of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks), as well as extreme preterm birth (less than 28 weeks).

Women with a low BMI are at increased risk for preterm birth. [ Hendler I, Goldenberg RL, Mercer BM, et al. 2005 The preterm prediction study: association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and spontaneous preterm birth American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 192 3 882–886 15746686 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.09.021 ] Further, women with poor nutritional status may also be deficient in vitamin s and mineral s. Adequate nutrition is critical for fetal development and a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may help reduce the risk of a preterm delivery. [ 2005 Cholesterol Lowering Diet for Pregnant Women May Help Prevent Preterm Birth British Medical Journal 331 1093 10.1136/bmj.331.7525.0-e ] Obesity does not directly lead to preterm birth; however, it is associated with diabetes and hypertension which are risk factors by themselves. Women with a previous preterm birth are at higher risk for a recurrence at a rate of 15–50% depending on number of previous events and their timing. [ Mercer BM, Goldenberg RL, Moawad AH, et al. 1999 The preterm prediction study: effect of gestational age and cause of preterm birth on subsequent obstetric outcome American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 181 5 Pt 1 1216–1221 10561648 10.1016/S0002-9378(99)70111-0 ] To some degree those individuals may have underlying conditions (i.e. uterine malformation, hypertension, diabetes) that persist. Marital status is associated with risk for preterm birth. A study of 25,373 pregnancies in Finland revealed that unmarried mothers had more preterm deliveries than married mothers (P=0.001). [ Raatikainen K, Heiskanen N, Heinonen S 2005 Marriage still protects pregnancy BJOG 112 10 1411–6 16167946 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00667.x ] Pregnancy outside of marriage was associated overall with a 20% increase in total adverse outcomes, even at a time when Finland provided free maternity care. A study in Quebec of 720,586 births from 1990-97 revealed less risk of preterm birth for infants with legally married mothers, compared with those with common law wed or unwed parents.

[ Factors during pregnancy ] Multiple pregnancies ( twins, triplets, etc.) are a significant factor in preterm birth. The March of Dimes Multicenter Prematurity and Prevention Study found that 54% of twins were delivered preterm vs. 9.6% of singleton births.

The use of fertility medication that stimulates the ovary to release multiple eggs and of IVF with embryo transfer of multiple embryos has been implicated as an important factor in preterm birth.

Finally, the use of tobacco, cocaine, and excessive alcohol during pregnancy also increases the chance of preterm delivery. Tobacco is the most commonly abused drug during pregnancy and also contributes significantly to low birth weight delivery.

[ Goldenberg RL, Hauth JC, Andrews WW 2000 Intrauterine infection and preterm delivery New England Journal of Medicine 342 20 1500–1507 10816189 10.1056/NEJM200005183422007 ] The frequency of infection in preterm birth is inversely related to the gestational age. Endotoxin s released by microorganisms and cytokine s stimulate deciduas responses including the release of prostaglandin s which may stimulate uterine contractions. Further the decidual response may include release of matrix-degrading enzymes that weaken fetal membranes leading to premature rupture. Intrauterine infection appears to be a chronic process. Typical organisms identified in the uterus before rupture of the membranes are genital Mycoplasma spp and specifically Ureaplasma urealyticum. Micro-organisms may reach the decidua in a number of ways, ascending, hematogeneous, iatrogenic by a procedure, or retrograde through the fallopian tubes. From the deciduas they may reach the space between the amnion and chorion, the amniotic fluid, and finally the fetus. A chorioamnionitis also may lead to sepsis of the mother. Fetal infection not only is linked to preterm birth but to significant long-term handicap including cerebral palsy. It has been reported that asymptomatic colonization of the decidua occurs in up to 70% of women at term using a DNA probe suggesting that the presence of micro-organism alone may be insufficient to initiate the infectious response. Bacterial vaginosis has been linked to preterm birth raising the risk by a factor of 1.5 – 3. [ Hillier SL, Nugent RP, Eschenbach DA, et al. 1995 Association between bacterial vaginosis and preterm delivery of a low-birthweight infant.

It is opined that bacterial vaginosis before or during pregnancy may affect the decidual inflammatory response that leads to preterm birth. A number of maternal bacterial infections are associated with preterm birth including pyelonephritis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, pneumonia, and appendicitis. Also periodontal disease has been shown repeatedly to be linked to preterm birth. [ Jeffcoat MK, Geurs NC, Reddy MS, Cliver SC, Goldenberg RL, Hauth JC 2001 Periodontal Infection and Preterm Birth Journal of the American Dental Association 132 7 875–880 11480640 ] In contrast, viral infections, unless accompanied by a significant febrile response, are considered not to be a major factor in relation to preterm birth. [ Diagnosis ] A helpful clinical test should predict a high risk for preterm birth during the early and middle part of the third trimester, when their impact is significant. Many women experience false labor (not leading to cervical shortening and effacement) and are falsely labeled to be in preterm labor. The study of preterm birth has been hampered by the difficulty in distinguishing between &quot; true &quot; preterm labor and false labor. These new tests are used to identify women at risk for preterm birth. [ Fetal fibronectin ] Fetal fibronectin has become the most important biomarker—the presence of this glycoprotein in the cervical or vaginal secretions indicates that the border between the chorion and deciduas has been disrupted. A positive test indicates an increased risk of preterm birth, and a negative test has a high predictive value. It has been shown that only 1% of women in questionable cases of preterm labor delivered within the next week when the test was negative. [ Lu GC, Goldenberg RL, Cliver SP, Kreaden US, Andrews WW 2001 Vaginal fetal fibronectin levels and spontaneous preterm birth in symptomatic women Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 97 2 225–228 11165589 10.1016/S0029-7844(00)01130-3 ] [ Ultrasonography of the cervix ] Obstetric ultrasound has become useful in the assessment of the cervix in women at risk for premature delivery. A short cervix preterm is undesirable: At 24 weeks gestation a cervix length of less than 25  mm defines a risk group for preterm birth. Further, the shorter the cervix the greater the risk. [ Iams JD, Goldenberg RL, Meis PJ, et al. 1996 The length of the cervix and the risk of spontaneous premature delivery.

Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth. Increasingly primary interventions that are directed at all women, and secondary intervention that reduce existing risks are looked upon as measures that need to be developed and implemented to prevent the health problems of premature infants and children. [ Iams JD, Romero R, Culhane JF, Goldenberg RL 2008 Primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality of preterm birth The Lancet 371 9607 164–175 18191687 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60108-7 ] [ Preconceptional ] Raising public and professional awareness about the scope of the problem and its significance as the major contributor to infant mortality is important to reduce avoidable risk factors. [ April 2011 ] Among them [ April 2011 ] is the need to reduce repeated uterine instrumentation (i.e. repeated surgical abortions) [ Ancel PY, Lelong N, Papiernik E, et al. and for EUROPOP 2004 History of induced abortion as a risk factor for preterm birth in European countries: results of the EUROPOP survey Human Reproduction 19 3 734–740 14998979 10.1093/humrep/deh107 ] and to avoid risky choices in infertility treatments. Adoption of specific professional policies can immediately reduce risk of preterm birth as the experience in assisted reproduction has shown when the number of embryos during embryo transfer were limited. Many countries have established specific programs to protect pregnant women from hazardous and night-shift work, and to provide them with time for prenatal visits and paid pregnancy-leave. The EUROPOP study showed that preterm birth is not related to type of employment, but to prolonged work (over 42 hours per week) or prolonged standing (over 6 hours per day). [ Saurel-Cubizolles MJ, Zeitlin J, Lelong N, et al. and for the Europop Group 2004 Employment, working conditions, and preterm birth: results from the Europop case-control survey Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health 58 5 395–401 15082738 1732750 10.1136/jech.2003.008029 ] Also, night work has been linked to preterm birth. Other Complications include: [ April 2011 ] Jaundice Of Prematurity Atrial septal defects commonly seen in babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia because their lungs are so fragile. GER Gastroesophgeal reflux Patent Ductus Arterosis Seizures Immature GI system so feeding from a (NG) tube or nasogastric tube may help make feeding easier on the babies&apos; tummy. Also theirs TPN feeding or Total Parentral Nutrition its made up of lipids, calories, good fats calsuim, magnesium salfate and other vitamins including B and C. Neonatalologists work with the family as a whole instead of just the neonate or baby whose systems are to immature to actually swallow food so babies between 23-28 weeks are fed through a neonatal gastric tube from the babies nose to the stomach. In some neonates there are disabilities from varying conditions of the baby this depends on the gestational age the babies delivered at usually women with severe enough preeclampsia will deliver earlier than normal and those mothers worry greatly because of all of their rumours about NICUs and babies needing wheelchairs glasses and also needing medicines for seizures and ADD/ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, anxiety disorder s.

Avoidance of weight extremes and good nutritional support are important. Although a study failed to show that multivitamin preparation taken prior to conception reduces the risk of preterm birth, [ Czeizel AE, Dudas I, Metnecki J 1994 Pregnancy outcomes in a randomised controlled trial of periconceptional multivitamin supplementation. Final report Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics 255 3 131–139 7979565 10.1007/BF02390940 ] preconceptional intake of folic acid is recommended to reduce birth defects. There is significant evidence that long term ( &gt; one year) use of folic acid supplement preconceptionally may reduce premature birth.

[ During pregnancy ] Interventions that should have been initiated prior to pregnancy can still be instituted during pregnancy, including nutritional adjustments, use of vitamin supplements, and smoking cessation. Calcium supplementation as well as supplemental intake of C and E vitamins could not be shown to reduce preterm birth rates. [ Hofmeyr GJ, Atallah AN, Duley L 2006 Calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing hypertensive disorders and related problems Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews 3 CD001059 16855957 10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub2 ] [ Rumbold AR, Crowther CA, Haslam RR, et al. 2006 Vitamins C and E and the risks of preeclampsia and perinatal complications New England Journal of Medicine 354 17 1796–1806 16641396 10.1056/NEJMoa054186 ] Different strategies are used in the administration of prenatal care, and future studies need to determine if the focus should be on screening for high risk women, or widened support for low-risk women, or to what degree these approaches should be merged. While periodontal infection has been linked with preterm birth, randomized trials have not shown that periodontal care during pregnancy reduces preterm birth rates. [ Screening of low risk women ] Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria followed by appropriate treatment reduces pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm birth. [ Romero R, Oyarzun E, Mazor M, Sirtori M, Hobbins JC, Bracken M 1989 Meta-analysis of the relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and preterm delivery/low birth weight Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 73 4 576–582 2927852 ] Extensive studies have been carried out to determine if other forms of screening in low-risk women followed by appropriate intervention are beneficial, including: Screening for and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the rate of preterm birth. Routine ultrasound examination of the length of the cervix identifies patients at risk, but cerclage is not proven useful, and the application of a progesterone is under study. Screening for the presence of fibronectin in vaginal secretions is not recommended at this time in women at low risk. [ Self-care ] Self-care methods to reduce the risk of preterm birth include proper nutrition, avoiding stress, seeking appropriate medical care, avoiding infections, and the control of preterm birth risk factors (e.g. working long hours while standing on feet, carbon monoxide exposure, domestic abuse, and other factors). Self-monitoring vaginal pH followed by yogurt treatment or clindamycin treatment if the pH was too high all seem to be effective at reducing the risk of preterm birth. [ Lamont RF, Jaggat AN 2007 Emerging drug therapies for preventing spontaneous preterm labor and preterm birth Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs 16 17302528 3 10.1517/13543784.16.3.337 337–345 ] [ Hoyme UB, Saling E 2004 Efficient prematurity prevention is possible by pH-self measurement and immediate therapy of threatening ascending infection European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 115 2 148–153 15262346 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2004.02.038 ] [ Secondary (reducing existing risks) ] Women are identified to be at increased risk for preterm birth on the basis of their past obstetrical history or the presence of known risk factors. Preconception intervention can be helpful in selected patients in a number of ways. Patients with certain uterine anomalies may have a surgical correction (i.e. removal of a uterine septum ), and those with certain medical problems can be helped by optimizing medical therapies prior to conception, be it for asthma, diabetes, hypertension and others. [ During pregnancy ] [ Reducing indicated preterm birth ] A number of agents have been studied for secondary prevention of indicated preterm birth. Trials using low-dose aspirin, fish oil, vitamin C and E, and calcium to reduce preeclampsia demonstrated some reduction in preterm birth only when low-aspirin was used. Interestingly, even if agents such as calcium or antioxidant s were able to reduce preeclampsia, a resulting decrease in preterm birth was not observed. [ Reducing spontaneous preterm birth ] Reduction in maternal activity – pelvic rest, limited work, bed rest – is frequently recommended although there is no clear proof of its efficacy. Also, increasing medical care by more frequent visits and more education has not shown a reduction in preterm birth rates. [ Hodnett ED, Fredericks S 2003 Support during pregnancy for women at increased risk of low birth weight babies Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews 3 3 CD000198 12917888 10.1002/14651858.CD000198 ] Use of nutritional supplements such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid s is based on the observation that populations who have a high intake of such agents are at low risk for preterm birth, presumably as these agents inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines. A randomized trial showed a significant decline in preterm birth rates, [ Olsen SF, Secher SJ, Tabor A, et al. 2000 Randomised clinical trials of fish oil supplementation in high risk pregnancies. Fish Oil Trial In Pregnancy (FOTIP) Team British Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 107 3 382–395 10740336 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2000.tb13235.x ] and further studies are in the making. Antibiotics Studies examining the use of antibiotics have provided mixed results; a Cochrane review of 15 trials shows no major benefit, [ McDonald HM, Brocklehurst P, Gordon A 2007 Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) 1 1 CD000262 17253447 10.1002/14651858.CD000262.pub3 ] in contrast a review by Lamont suggested that treatment of bacterial vaginosis if initiated prior to 20 w gestation is beneficial. [ Lamont RF 2005 Can antibiotics prevent preterm birth–the pro and con debate British Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 112 Suppl 1 67–73 15715599 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00589.x ] It has been suggested that the presence of a chronic chorioamnionitis may not be amenable to antibiotics, thus the difficulty to demonstrate their effectiveness. Progesterone Progesterone, often given in the form of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, relaxes the uterine musculature, maintains cervical length, and has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus exerts activities expected to be beneficial in reducing preterm birth. Two meta-analyses demonstrated a reduction in the risk of preterm birth in women with recurrent preterm birth by 40–55%. [ Dodd JM, Flenady V, Cincotta R, Crowther CA 2006 Prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews 1 1 CD004947 18591318 10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817d0262 ] [ Mackenzie R, Walker M, Armson A, Hannah ME 2006 Progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth among women at increased.

American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 194 5 1234–1242 16647905 10.1016/j.ajog.2005.06.049 ] However, progesterone is not effective in all populations, as a study involving twin gestations failed to see any benefit. [ Caritis S, Rouse D 2006 A randomized controlled trial of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) for the prevention of preterm birth in twins American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 195 S2 10.1016/j.ajog.2006.10.003 ] Cervical cerclage In preparation for childbirth, the woman&apos;s cervix shortens. Preterm cervical shortening is linked to preterm birth and can be detected by ultrasonography. Cervical cerclage is a surgical intervention that places a suture around the cervix to prevent its shortening and widening. Numerous studies have been performed to assess the value of cervical cerclage and the procedure appears helpful primarily for women with a short cervix and a history of preterm birth. [ 10.1097/01.AOG.0000168435.17200.53 Berghella V, Odibo AO, To MS, Rust O, Althuisius SM 2005 Cerclage for short cervix on ultrasonography; meta-analysis of trials using individual patient data Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 106 1 181–189 15994635 ] Instead of a prophylactic cerclage, women at risk can be monitored during pregnancy by sonography, and when shortening of the cervix is observed, the cerclage can be performed. However, no matter how careful you are spontaneous preterm birth can still occur. Know your body and see your doctor immediately if you notice any sudden changes or experience early contractions. [ Management ] Tertiary interventions are aimed at women who are about to go into preterm labor, or rupture the membranes or bleed preterm. The use of the fibronectin test and ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and reduces false-positive diagnosis. While treatments to arrest early labor where there is progressive cervical dilatation and effacement will not be effective to gain sufficient time to allow the fetus to grow and mature further, it may defer delivery sufficiently to allow the mother to be brought to a specialized center that is equipped and staffed to handle preterm deliveries. [ Phibbs CS, Baker LC, Caughey AB, et al. 2007 Level and volume of neonatal intensive care and mortality in very-low-birth-weight infants New England Journal of Medicine 356 21 2165–2175 17522400 10.1056/NEJMsa065029 ] Centers for the care of women with preterm delivery are usually staffed by maternal-fetal specialists and highly trained staff and linked to neonatal intensive care units (vi). In a hospital setting women are hydrated via intravenous infusion as dehydration can lead to premature uterine contractions. [ Glucocorticosteroids ] Severely premature infants may have underdeveloped lungs, because they are not yet producing their own surfactant. This can lead directly to respiratory distress syndrome, also called hyaline membrane disease, in the neonate. To try to reduce the risk of this outcome, pregnant mothers with threatened premature delivery prior to 34 weeks are often administered at least one course of glucocorticoids, a steroid that crosses the placental barrier and stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs of the fetus. Typical glucocorticoids that would be administered in this context are betamethasone or dexamethasone, often when the fetus has reached viability at 23 weeks. In cases where premature birth is imminent, a second &quot; rescue &quot; course of steroids may be administered 12 to 24 hours before the anticipated birth. There is no research consensus on the efficacy and side-effects of a second course of steroids, but the consequences of RDS are so severe that a second course is often viewed as worth the risk. Beside reducing respiratory distress, other neonatal complications are reduced by the use of glucocorticosteroids, namely intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, and patent ductus arteriosus. [ Roberts D, Dalziel S 2006 Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews 3 CD004454 16856047 10.1002/14651858.CD004454.pub2 ] Despite being used for over 50 years to treat respiratory distress syndrome, glucocorticosteroid therapy is still controversial. Much of this concern is based on when these steroids should be administered (i.e. prenatally or postnatally) or for how long (i.e. acutely or chronically). For instance, clinical research conducted in 2004 has shown that the postnatal administration of dexamethasone can lead to permanent neuromotor and cognitive deficits. [ Yeh TF, Lin YJ, Lin HC, et al. 2004 Outcomes at school age after postnatal dexamethasone therapy for lung disease of prematurity New England Journal of Medicine 350 13 1304–1313 15044641 10.1056/NEJMoa032089 ] This has led to a drastic reduction in the postnatal use of glucocorticosteroids in prematurely born infants. In addition, a recent large scale study has found that a second “rescue” dose of betamethasone prenatally does not improve preterm birth outcomes and leads to decreased weight, length, and head circumference. [ Murphy KE, Hannah ME, Willan AR, et al. 2008 Multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids for preterm birth (MACS): a randomised controlled trial The Lancet 372 9656 2143–2151 19101390 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61929-7 ] Other side effects of corticosteroids are diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, inhibition of growth, hypertension, cognitive problems, anxiety, depression, gastritis, colitis. Finally, a single study on animals has shown that a single exposure to these same drugs during brain development causes rapid brain degeneration. [ Noguchi KK, Walls KC, Wozniak DF, et al. 2008 Acute neonatal glucocorticoid exposure produces selective and rapid cerebellar neural progenitor cell apoptotic death Cell Death &amp; Differentiation 15 10 1582–1592 18600230 2636573 10.1038/cdd.2008.97 ] [ http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20081118/bl_bottomstrip18.art.htm USA Today Steroids used in preemies may kill brain cells 2008-11-17 2010-05-22 ] Despite these concerns, there is a consensus that the benefits of a single regimen of prenatal glucocorticosteroids vastly outweigh the potential risks. { http://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994AntenatalSteroidPerinatal095html.htm } The routine administration of antibiotics to all women with threatened preterm labor reduces the risk of the baby to get infected with group B streptococcus and has been shown to reduce related mortality rates. [ Schrag S, Gorwitz R, Kultz-Butts K, Schuchat K 2002 Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease. Revised guidelines from CDC MMWR: Recommendations and Reports 51 RR-11 1–22 12211284 ] Research reported at the 2008 conference of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine suggests that administration of magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) to women just before premature birth can cut the rate of cerebral palsy in half. While the compound is cheap and safe, it may make mothers and infants groggy, and details are pending scientific publication. [ Tocolysis ] Anti-contraction medications ( tocolytic s ), such as Beta2-agonist drugs ( ritodrine, terbutaline, fenoterol ), calcium-channel blockers nifedipine and oxytocin antagonists ( atosiban ) appear only to have a temporary effect in delaying delivery. Tocolysis has not fulfilled its promise as it is rarely successful beyond 24–48 hours because current medication do not alter the fundamentals of labor activation. However, just gaining 48 hours is sufficient to allow the pregnant women to be transferred to a center specialized for management of preterm deliveries and give administered corticosteroids the possibility to reduce neonatal organ immaturity. Meta-analyses indicate that calcium-channel blockers and an oxytocin antagonist can delay delivery by 2–7 days, and β2-agonist drugs delay by 48 hours but carry more side effects. { Li X, Zhang Y, Shi Z. Ritodrine in the treatment of preterm labour: a meta-analysis.Indian J Med Res. 2005 Feb;121(2):120-7.PMID 15756046 } Meta-analyses of magnesium sulfate failed to support it as a tocolytic agent. When membranes rupture prematurely, obstetrical management looks for development of labor and signs of infection. Administration of corticosteroid s is indicated prior to 32 weeks gestation. Prophylactic antibiotic administration has been shown to prolong pregnancy and reduced neonatal morbidity with rupture of membranes at less than 34 weeks. [ Kenyon SL, Taylor DJ, Tarnow-Mordi W 2001 Broad-spectrum antibiotics for preterm, prelabour rupture of fetal membranes: the ORACLE I randomised trial. ORACLE Collaborative Group The Lancet 357 9261 979–988 11293641 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04233-1 ] Because of concern about necrotizing enterocolitis, amoxicillin or erythromycin has been recommended, but not amoxicillin + clavulanic acid ( co-amoxiclav ). The routine use of cesarean section for early delivery of infants expected to have very low birth weight is controversial, and a decision concerning the route and time of delivery probably needs to be made on a case by case basis. [ Neonatal care ] In developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as neonatologists. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in incubator s (also called isolettes), which are bassinet s enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, oxygenation, and brain activity. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through intravenous catheters, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as kangaroo care (skin to skin warming), encouraging breastfeeding, and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm morbidity and mortality. Bili light s may also be used to treat newborn jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia). Prophylactic treatments are also used to care for preterm infants. For example, indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) is commonly used to help with the closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A recent study on extremely premature infants (23-24 weeks) treated prophylactically with indomethacin within 6 hours of life showed a relative risk reduction (RRR) of developing symptomatic PDA (bounding pulses, wide pulse pressure, pulmonary congestion) to be 100% when compared to infants who were not given indomethacin until ductus-related signs were observed. In addition, infants treated prophylactically also showed a 50% RRR of severe intraventricular hemorrhage and 100% RRR of other major complications (pulmonary hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, etc.) when compared to the patient controls. { Yoshimoto S, Sakai H, Ueda M, Mayumi Y, Mizobuchi M, Naka H. &quot; Prophylactic indomethacin in extremely premature infants between 23 and 24 weeks of gestation. &quot; Pediatrics International. 2010; 52: 374-377. } [ 10.1111/j.1442-200X.2009.02977.x ] [ Prognosis ] Many children will adjust well during childhood and adolescence, [ Saigal S, Doyle LW 2008 An overview of mortality and sequelae of preterm birth from infancy to adulthood. The Lancet 371 9608 261–269 18207020 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60136-1 ] although a large study that followed children born between 22 and 25 weeks found some alarming results. When the children were 6 years old it was found that 46 percent had severe or moderate disabilities such as cerebral palsy, vision or hearing loss and learning problems; 34 percent were mildly disabled while 20 percent had no disabilities.12 percent had disabling cerebral palsy. For the first time this gave a real picture of what happens to children who are at the limits of viability. As survival has improved, the focus of interventions directed at the newborn has shifted to reduce long-term disabilities, particularly those related to brain injury. Some of the complications related to prematurity may not be apparent until years after the birth. A long-term study demonstrated that the risks of medical and social disabilities extend into adulthood and are higher with decreasing gestational age at birth and include cerebral palsy, mental retardation, disorders of psychological development, behavior, and emotion, disabilities of vision and hearing, and epilepsy. [ Moster D, Lie RT, Markestad T 2008 Long-Term Medical and Social Consequences of Preterm Birth New England Journal of Medicine 359 3 262–273 18635431 10.1056/NEJMoa0706475 ] Standard intelligence tests showed that 41 percent of children born between 22 and 25 weeks had moderate or severe learning disabilities when compared to the test scores of a group of similar classmates who were born at full-term. It is also shown that higher levels of education were less likely to be obtained with decreasing gestational age at birth. People born prematurely may be more susceptible to developing depression as teenagers.

Three obstetric events precede preterm birth: spontaneous preterm births are the 40–45% preterm births that follow preterm labor and the 25–30% preterm births after premature rupture of membrane s. The remainder (30–35%) are preterm births that are induced for obstetrical reasons; obstetricians may have to deliver the baby preterm because of a deteriorating intrauterine environment (i.e. infection, intrauterine growth retardation ) or significant endangerment of the maternal health (i.e. preeclampsia, cancer ). By gestational age, 5% of preterm births occur at less than 28 weeks (extreme prematurity), 15% at 28–31 weeks (severe prematurity), 20% at 32–33 weeks (moderate prematurity), and 60–70% at 34–36 weeks (late preterm).

[ Data and statistics http://www.who.int/research/en/ World Health Organisation ] It is estimated that one-third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to preterm delivery. Weight generally correlates to gestational age, however, infants may be underweight for other reasons than a preterm delivery. Neonates of low birth weight (LBW) have a birth weight of less than 2500 g (5  lb 8 oz) and are mostly but not exclusively preterm babies as they also include small for gestational age (SGA) babies. Weight-based classification further recognizes Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) which is less than 1500 g, and Extremely Low Birth Weight (ELBW) which is less than 1000 g. [ Subramanian, KNS 18 June 2009 Extremely Low Birth Weight Infant http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2784.htm eMedicine 2009-08-26 ] Almost all neonates in these latter two groups are born preterm. Preterm birth is a significant cost factor in healthcare, not even considering the expenses of long-term care for individuals with disabilities due to preterm birth. A 2003 study in the US determined neonatal costs to be $224,400 for a newborn at 500–700 g versus $1,000 at over 3,000 g. The costs increase exponentially with decreasing gestational age and weight.

At birth, she was [ 9 in cm 1 ] long and weighed 10 ounces (283  grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children&apos;s Hospital on 20 February 2007.

The autistic savant Derek Paravicini was born at 25 weeks. The oxygen therapy given during his time in a neonatal intensive care unit rendered him blind and affected his developing brain, resulting in his severe learning disability. Furthermore Paravicini developed autism. However, he also has absolute pitch and highly developed musical abilities.

But it is difficult to predict which babies will die and which will live with severe disabilities. As a consequence, families and health professionals have to make complex decisions about how much intervention is necessary or justifiable. The most difficult decisions are about whether or not to resuscitate a premature baby and admit him or her to neonatal intensive care, or whether to withdraw intensive care and give the child palliative care. This is discussed at great length in a report &quot; Critical care decisions in fetal and neonatal medicine: ethical issues &quot; [ Nuffield Council for Bioethics 2006 Critical care decisions in fetal and neonatal medicine http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/sites/default/files/CCD%20web%20version%2022%20June%2007%20%28updated%29.pdf Critical care decisions in fetal and neonatal medicine ] produced by the London-based Nuffield Council for Bioethics. In the UK, the debate regarding resuscitation of babies born at 23 weeks was highlighted by Dr Daphne Austin, an NHS official who advised local health authorities on how to spend their budgets in 2011. She argued that babies born at 23 weeks should not be resuscitated because their chances of surviving are so slim and that there is sufficient evidence that keeping the babies alive can do more harm than good. UK official guidelines for pre-term babies state that medics should not attempt to resuscitate babies born before 22 weeks, as they are too under developed. Babies born between 22 and 25 weeks should be given intensive care as routine. { Premature Babies at 23 Weeks : Mindful Mum Retrieved 16 April 2012 } [ The age of viability ] The gestational age at which a child is born plays a key part in these decisions. [ April 2012 ] [ April 2012 ] 22 weeks: in the UK and France babies are not normally resuscitated. 23 weeks: in the Netherlands, babies are not normally resuscitated at this age or below. 24 weeks: In most countries, babies at this gestation are resuscitated.
