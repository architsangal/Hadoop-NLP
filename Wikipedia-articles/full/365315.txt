It is the most common falcon in North America, and is found in a wide variety of habitats. At [ 19 - 21 cm in 0 us ] long, it is also the smallest falcon in North America. It exhibits sexual dimorphism in size and plumage, although both sexes have a rufous back with noticeable barring. Juveniles are similar in plumage to adults. The American Kestrel hunts by hovering in the air with rapid wing beats or perching and scanning the ground for prey. Its diet typically consists of grasshopper s, lizard s, mice, and other small birds. It nests in cavities in trees, cliffs, buildings, and other structures. The female lays three to seven eggs, which both sexes help to incubate. It is a common bird to be used in falconry, especially by beginners. Its breeding range extends from central and western Alaska across northern Canada to Nova Scotia, and south throughout North America, into central Mexico and the Caribbean. It is a local breeder in Central America and is widely distributed throughout South America. Most birds breeding in Canada and the northern United States migrate south in the winter. It is an occasional vagrant to western Europe. [ Description ] The American Kestrel is the smallest falcon in North America and, under traditional classification, is the smallest raptor in America. { The American Kestrel: Falcon of Many Names by Wauer and Clark. Johnson Books (2005), ISBN 1555663532 } The American Kestrel is sexually dimorphic, although there is some overlap in plumage coloration between the sexes. The bird ranges from [ 19 to 31 cm in on ] in length with a wingspan of [ 50 - 61 cm in on ]. The female kestrel is larger than the male. The male weighs [ 80 - 120 g oz on ], as opposed to the female which weighs [ 118 - 166 g oz abbr-on ]. In standard measurements, the wing bone is [ 16 - 21 cm in on ] long, the tail is [ 11 - 15 cm in on ] and the tarsus is [ 3.2 - 4 cm in on ]. [ http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Falco_sparverius.html American Kestrel Falco sparverius University of Michigan Museum of Geology McCollough 13 September 2010 ] { Raptors of the World by Ferguson-Lees, Christie, Franklin, Mead &amp; Burton. Houghton Mifflin (2001), ISBN 0-618-12762-3 } In contrast to many other raptor species, the sexes differ more in plumage than in size. Males have blue-grey wing s with black spots and white undersides with black barring. The back is rufous, with barring on the lower half. The belly and flanks are white with black spotting. The tail is also rufous, with a white or rufous tip and a black subterminal band. [ http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Kestrel/id American Kestrel, Falco sparverius Cornell Lab of Ornithology 13 September 2010 ] The back and wings of the female American Kestrel are rufous with dark brown barring. The undersides of the females are creamy to buff with heavy brown streaking. The tail is noticeably different from the male&apos;s, being rufous in color with numerous narrow dark black bars. Juveniles exhibit coloration patterns similar to the adults&apos;. In both sexes, the head is white with a bluish-grey top. There are also two narrow, vertical black facial markings on each side of the head, while other falcons have one. { Tveten &amp; Tveten (2004), p. 210 } Two black spots (ocelli) can be found on each side of the white or orangish nape. { Clark &amp; Wheeler (2001), p. 252 } The function of these spots is debated, but the most commonly accepted theory is that they act as &quot; false eyes &quot;, and help to protect the bird from potential attackers.

While the kestrel is perched, the wingtips are noticeably shorter than the tail tip. [ November 2011 ] [ Vocalizations ] The American Kestrel has three basic vocalizations – the &quot; klee &quot; or &quot; killy &quot;, the &quot; whine &quot;, and the &quot; chitter. &quot; [ Mueller Helmut C. 1971 Displays and Vocalizations of the Sparrow Hawk The Wilson Bulletin Wilson Ornithological Society 83 3 249–254 http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Wilson/v083n03/p0249-p0254.pdf ] The &quot; klee &quot; is usually delivered as a rapid series – klee, klee, klee, klee when the kestrel is upset or excited. This call is used in a wide variety of situations and is heard from both sexes, but the larger females typically have lower-pitched voices than the males. The &quot; whine &quot; call is primarily associated with feeding, but is also uttered during copulation. The &quot; chitter &quot; is used in activities which involve interaction between male and female birds, including courtship feeding, copulation, and the feeding of nestlings. { Wauer (2005), pp. 11–12 } Nestlings can produce calls similar to those of adults at 16 days old. [ Smallwoood John A. Dudajek Valerie 2003 Vocal Development in American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) Nestlings Journal of Raptor Research Raptor Research Foundation 37 1 37–43 http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/jrr/v037n01/p00037-p00043.pdf ] [ Taxonomy ] Until the sixth edition of the AOU Checklist of North American Birds was published by the American Ornithologists&apos; Union in 1983, the most commonly used name for the American Kestrel was the Sparrow Hawk or Sparrowhawk. This was due to a mistaken connection with the Eurasian Sparrowhawk in the genus Accipiter. The sixth edition of the AOU Checklist corrected this, officially renaming the bird American Kestrel. Several other colloquial names for the kestrel are also in use, including Grasshopper Hawk, due to its diet, and Killy Hawk, due to its distinct call. { Wauer (2005), p. 4 } The American Kestrel&apos;s scientific name, Falco sparverius, was given by Carolus Linnaeus in his 18th century work Systema Naturae. [ Linnaeus Carolus Carolus Linnaeus Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I. Editio decima, reformata Latin Holmiae: Laurentii Salvii. 1758 152 ] The genus refers to the falcate, or hooked, shape of the beak, and the specific name means &quot; pertaining to a sparrow &quot;, referring to the bird&apos;s small size and occasional hunting of sparrows. Seventeen subspecies of the American Kestrel are recognized, generally based upon plumage, size, and vocalizations: [ http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/602/articles/systematics American Kestrel: Systematics Smallwood John A. Bird David M. Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2002 4 September 2010 ] F. s. sparverius, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the nominate subspecies. It is found in most of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. F. s. paulus, described by Howe and King in 1902, is found in the Southeast United States, from Louisiana to Florida. F. s. peninsularis, described by Mearns in 1892, is found in southern Baja California. F. s. tropicalis, described by Griscom in 1930, is found from southern Mexico to northern Honduras. F. s. nicaraguensis, described by Howell in 1965, is found in Honduras and Nicaragua. F. s. sparveroides, described by Vigors in 1827, is found in Cuba and the Isle of Youth, and southern to central Bahamas. F. s. dominicensis, described by Gmelin in 1788, is found in Puerto Rico through the Lesser Antilles to Grenada. F. s. caribaearum, described by Gmelin in 1788, is found in Hispaniola. F. s. brevipennis, described by Berlepsch in 1892, is found in the Netherlands Antilles. F. s. isabellinus, described by Swainson in 1837, is found from Venezuela to northern Brazil. F. s. ochraceus, described by Cory in 1915, is found in eastern Colombia and northwest Venezuela. F. s. caucae, described by Chapman in 1915, is found in western Colombia. F. s. aequatorialis, described by Mearns in 1892, is found in northern Ecuador. F. s. peruvianus, described by Cory in 1915, is found in southwest Ecuador, Peru, and northern Chile. F. s. fernandensis, described by Chapman in 1915, is found on the Juan Fernández Islands off Chile. F. s. cinnamominu, described by Swainson in 1837, is found in Peru, Chile, and Argentina. F. s. cearae, described by Cory in 1915, is found from northeast Brazil south to eastern Bolivia. [ Ecology and behavior ] Female about to pounce American Kestrels are found in a wide variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, deserts, and other open to semiopen regions. They can also be found in both urban and suburban areas. A kestrel&apos;s habitat must include perches, open space for hunting, and cavities for nesting (whether natural or man-made). [ http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Kestrel/lifehistory American Kestrel, Life History All About Birds Cornell Lab of Ornithology 3 September 2010 ] The American Kestrel is able to live in very diverse conditions, ranging from above the Arctic Circle, { Wauer (2005), p. 15 } to the tropics of Central America, to elevations of over [ 4500 m ft 0... us ] in the Andes Mountains. { Fjeldså &amp; Krabbe (1990), p. 112 } The bird is distributed from northern Canada and Alaska to the southernmost tip of South America, Tierra del Fuego. It is the only kestrel found in the Americas. [ http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/602/articles/introduction American Kestrel: Introduction Smallwood John A. Bird David M. Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2002 2 November 2010 ] It has occurred as a vagrant in the UK, Denmark, Malta and the Azores. [ Snow David Perrins, Christopher M (editors) The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) Oxford University Press 1998 Oxford 152 0-19-850188-9 ] American Kestrels in Canada and the northern United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35 degrees north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. { Wauer (2005), pp. 23–24 } Wintering kestrels&apos; choice of habitat varies by sex. Females are found in open areas more often than males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory. [ 10.1006/anbe.1996.0364 Ardia Daniel R.

Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2002 27 May 2012 ] In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans. [ http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/602/articles/demography American Kestrel: Demography and Populations Smallwood John A. Bird David M. Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2002 5 September 2010 ] [ Feeding ] On the lookout American Kestrels feed largely on small animals such as grasshopper s, dragonflies, lizard s, mice, and vole s. They will also eat other small birds. The kestrel has also been reported to have killed larger animals such as snakes, bats, and squirrels. [ Sherrod Steve K. 1978 Diets of North American Falconiformes Journal of Raptor Research Raptor Research Foundation 12 2 103–106 http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/jrr/v012n03-04/p00049-p00121.pdf ] The kestrel maintains high population densities, in part because of the broad scope of its diet. The American Kestrel&apos;s primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects in the air. [ Collopy Michael W. Koplin James R. 1983 Diet, Capture Success, and Mode of Hunting by Female American Kestrels in Winter The Condor Cooper Ornithological Society 85 3 69–371 136708 ] Prey is almost always caught on the ground. Before striking, the kestrel characteristically bobs its head and tail, then makes a direct flight toward the prey to grab it in its talons. During the breeding season, the bird will carry large prey back to its mate or young. One study found that an American Kestrel pair &quot; foraged in ways that minimized the costs of energy acquisition in its particular situation &quot;. For example, if the success rate for catching prey decreases significantly in a particular area, the bird will move to a different area.

Pair bonds are strong, often permanent. Pairs usually use previous nesting sites in consecutive years. This gives birds an advantage over younger or invading individuals, as they would already be familiar with the hunting grounds, neighbors, predators, and other features of the site. { Wauer (2005), p. 52 } Males perform elaborate dive displays to advertise their territory and attract a mate. These displays consist of several climbs and dives, with three or four &quot; klee &quot; calls at their peaks. Females are promiscuous for about one to two weeks after their arrival at the nesting site. This is thought to stimulate ovulation. { Wauer (2005), p. 54 } Food transfers from the male to the female occur from about four to five weeks prior to egg laying to one to two weeks after. [ http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/602/articles/behavior American Kestrel: Behavior Smallwood John A. Bird David M. Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2002 25 September 2010 ] American Kestrels are cavity nesters, but they are able to adapt to a wide variety of nesting situations. They generally prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. { Wauer (2005), p. 55 } Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpecker s, [ Gault Kathleen E.

The average egg size is 32  mm by 29  mm, 10% larger than average for birds of its body size. The eggs are white to cream in color with brown or grey splotching. Incubation usually lasts 30 days and is mainly the responsibility of the female, although the male incubates 15–20% of the time. Eggs which are lost are typically replaced in 11–12 days. Hatching takes place over three to four days. Hatchlings are altricial, and are only able to sit up after five days. They grow very quickly, reaching an adult weight after 16–17 days. After 28–31 days, their wings develop and they are able to leave the nest. { Wauer (2005), pp. 59–63 } [ Status and conservation ] The American Kestrel is likely the most abundant falcon in North America, although its total population is difficult to quantify, as local populations can change quickly due to resource availability. Count data from the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate that the North American breeding population is experiencing long-term and gradual but sustained declines, with some regions, such as New England and coastal California, exhibiting more rapid declines.

[ http://rpi-project.org/2011/assessments.php Raptor Population Index, Regional Population Trend Summaries 2011 Raptor Population Index 2012 27 May 2012 ] The North American population has been estimated at 1.2 million pairs, with the Central and South American populations being as large. A smaller estimate is 236,000 birds wintering in North America. A population increase occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, probably due to deforestation for agriculture. The resulting pastures provided an ideal habitat for kestrels. { San Diego Zoo } The southeastern U.S. subspecies (Falco sparverius paulus) has declined 82% since 1940 due to a decrease in nest site availability. This decline is a result of Longleaf Pines being cleared from agricultural fields. [ Hoffman Mark L. Collopy Michael W. 1988 Historical Status of the American Kestrel (Falco sparverius paulus) in Florida The Wilson Bulletin Wilson Ornithological Society 100 1 91–107 4162520 ] Despite this, the American Kestrel is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The Peregrine Fund, a leading non-profit organization advancing research and conservation of birds of prey worldwide, launched the American Kestrel Partnership in 2012. [ http://kestrel.peregrinefund.org/index.php American Kestrel Partnership The Peregrine Fund 2012 27 May 2012 ] The American Kestrel Partnership developed and maintains a web-based network for citizen and professional scientists to enter, manage, and consolidate data from kestrel nestbox monitoring programs in the Western Hemisphere. The database is being used by researchers to model and understand relationships between kestrel nesting parameters (e.g., phenology, occupancy, survival, productivity, and nestling weight and exposure to environmental toxins) and environmental factors, such as land use, landscape composition and configuration, climate conditions (e.g., drought), and point sources of environmental toxins. The American Kestrel Partnership&apos;s website, with support from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, features two live, streaming video feeds from a kestrel nestbox and breeding pair on The Peregrine Fund&apos;s campus in Boise, Idaho. [ http://kestrel.peregrinefund.org/index.php American Kestrel Partnership The Peregrine Fund 2012 27 May 2012 ] [ Relationship with humans ] One important use of American Kestrels is in falconry. Although most falconers prefer larger birds such as Peregrine Falcons and Northern Goshawk s when hunting, kestrels can be used to catch small birds, insects, and rodents. American Kestrels are also often used in scientific studies, because they can be bred easily in captivity. By artificially manipulating the daylight hours in captivity, scientists have bred them more than once a year. { Wauer (2005), pp. 75–76 } Migratory raptors native to the United States are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, so American Kestrels are illegal to possess without a permit in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
