{ Kensington, London, by } { Alvin Langdon Coburn } Ezra Weston Loomis Pound (30 October 1885 – 1 November 1972) was an American expatriate poet, critic and a major figure of the early modernist movement. His contribution to poetry began with his promotion of Imagism, a movement that derived its technique from classical Chinese and Japanese poetry, stressing clarity, precision and economy of language. His best-known works include Ripostes (1912), Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920), and his unfinished 120-section epic, The Cantos (1917–1969). Nadel (1999), xiv-xxxi For details of the publication sequence of the final cantos, see Bush (1999), 109 For a different view of the beginning of the Imagist movement, see for example Brown, Mark. &quot; Enthusiasts mark centenary of modern poetry &quot;, The Guardian, 25 March 2009, accessed 12 April 2012. Working in London in the early 20th century as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, Pound helped to discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Robert Frost, and Ernest Hemingway. He was responsible for the publication in 1915 of Eliot&apos;s &quot; The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, &quot; and for the serialization from 1918 of Joyce&apos;s Ulysses. Hemingway wrote of him in 1925: &quot; He defends [his friends] when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail.... He writes articles about them. He introduces them to wealthy women. He gets publishers to take their books. He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying... he advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide. &quot; For his promotion of other writers, see Hammer, Langdon.

For the quote from Hemingway, see Bruccoli and Baughman (2006), 5-6 Outraged by the loss of life during the First World War, he lost faith in England, blaming the war on usury and international capitalism. He moved to Italy in 1924 where throughout the 1930s and 1940s, to his friends&apos; dismay, he embraced Benito Mussolini &apos;s fascism, expressed support for Adolf Hitler, and wrote for publications owned by the British fascist Oswald Mosley. The Italian government paid him during the Second World War to make hundreds of radio broadcasts criticizing the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and in particular Jews, broadcasts that were monitored by the U.S. government, as a result of which he was arrested for treason by American forces in Italy in 1945. He spent months in detention in a U.S. military camp in Pisa, including 25  days in a six-by-six-foot outdoor steel cage that he said triggered a mental breakdown: &quot; when the raft broke and the waters went over me. &quot; Deemed unfit to stand trial, a decision disputed for decades after his death, he was incarcerated in St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years. For his support of Mussolini and Hitler, see Witemeyer (1996), 123–124 For his relationship with Mosley, see Haller (2005), 195 For the broadcasts, see Gill (2005), 115–116 For his mental breakdown, and the quote from The Pisan Cantos (80.665–67), see Sieburth (2003), xiii While in custody in Italy he had begun work on sections of The Cantos that became known as The Pisan Cantos (1948), for which he was awarded the Bollingen Prize in 1949 by the Library of Congress. The award triggered enormous controversy, mostly because of his antisemitism and the charge of treason, and in part because it raised literary questions about whether a supposedly &quot; mad &quot; poet who held such contentious views could produce work of any value. He was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958, thanks to a protracted campaign by his fellow writers, and returned to live in Italy until his death. His political views ensure that his work remains controversial; in 1933 Time magazine called him &quot; a cat that walks by himself, tenaciously unhousebroken and very unsafe for children. &quot; Hemingway nevertheless wrote: &quot; The best of Pound&apos;s writing – and it is in the Cantos – will last as long as there is any literature. &quot; For the controversy about the Bollingen prize, see Hammer, Langdon.

Pound - Brady-Handy.jpg 150 Thaddeus Pound, Pound&apos;s grandfather, in the late 1880s EzraPound &amp; IsabelPound1898.jpg 140 With his mother in 1898 ] Pound was born in Hailey, Idaho Territory, the only child of Homer Loomis Pound (1858–1942) and Isabel Weston (1860–1948). Both parents&apos; ancestors had emigrated from England in the 17th century. On his father&apos;s side, John Pound, a Quaker, sailed from England around 1650. His grandfather, Thaddeus Coleman Pound (1832–1914), was a retired Republican Congressman for north-west Wisconsin who had made and lost a fortune in the lumber business. His son Homer, Pound&apos;s father, had worked for Thaddeus until Thaddeus secured him an appointment as Register of the Government Land Office in Hailey. { Moody (2007), xiii–13 } On his mother&apos;s side Pound was descended from William Wadsworth, a Puritan who emigrated from England to Boston on the Lyon in 1632. { &apos;&apos;Lyon&apos;&apos; 1632 passenger list } The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York, and Harding Weston and Mary Parker produced Isabel Weston, Pound&apos;s mother. Harding apparently spent most of his life without work, so his brother, Ezra Weston and his wife, Frances, looked after Mary and Isabel&apos;s needs. Isabel was unhappy living in Hailey, and when her son was 18 months old she left with him to go back East. { Cockram (2005), 238 } Homer followed them, and in 1889 Homer took a job as an assayer at the Philadelphia Mint. The family moved to 417 Walnut Street in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, then in July 1893 bought a six-bedroom house at 166 Fernbrook Avenue in the town of Wyncote, Pennsylvania. [ Education ] Pound&apos;s early education took place in a series of so-called dame schools, some of them run by Quakers: Miss Elliott&apos;s school in Jenkintown in 1892; the Misses Heacock&apos;s Chelten Hills school in Wyncote in 1893; and the Florence Ridpath school from 1894, which became the Wyncote Public School a year later. From 1898 until 1900 he attended the Cheltenham Military Academy, where the boys wore Civil War-style uniforms and were taught military drilling, how to shoot, and the importance of submitting to authority. Pound was clever, independent-minded, conceited, and unpopular. He knew early on that he wanted to be a poet. His first publication was on 7  November  1896 in the Jenkintown Times-Chronicle, a limerick about American politician William Jennings Bryan, who had just lost the presidential election : By E.L. Pound, Wyncote, Aged 11 years: &quot; There was a young man from the West, / He did what he could for what he thought best. &quot; { qtd in Redman (1999), 251 } Pound&apos;s first trip overseas came two years later when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe with his mother and Aunt Frances, who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. He was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania &apos;s College of Liberal Arts in 1901 at the age of 15: { Hilda Doolittle at the University of Pennsylvania } [ I resolved that at 30 I would know more about poetry than any man living, that I would know what was accounted poetry everywhere, what part of poetry was &quot; indestructible, &quot; what part could not be lost by translation and – scarcely less important – what effects were obtainable in one language only and were utterly incapable of being translated. &lt; p &gt; In this search I learned more or less of nine foreign languages, I read Oriental stuff in translations, I fought every University regulation and every professor who tried to make me learn anything except this, or who bothered me with &quot; requirements for degrees. &quot; Levy (1983), 11 ] He met Hilda Doolittle at the University of Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of the professor of astronomy, and later became known as the poet H.D. Doolittle wrote that she felt her life was irrevocably intertwined with Pound&apos;s; she followed him to Europe in 1908, leaving her family, friends, and country for little benefit to herself, and became involved with Pound in developing the &quot; Imagisme &quot; movement in London. He asked her to marry him in the summer of 1907, though her father refused permission, and wrote several poems for her between 1905 and 1907, 25 of which he hand-bound and called &quot; Hilda&apos;s Book &quot;. Doolittle (1979), 67–68 Hilda&apos;s Book is in the Houghton Library at Harvard; see &quot; Poems and Translations &quot;, Library of America, accessed 21 October 2010. He was seeing two other women at the same time – Viola Baxter and Mary Moore – later dedicating a book of poetry, Personae (1909), to the latter. He asked Mary to marry him that summer too, but she turned him down. { Nadel (1999), 3–6 } [ I strove a little book to make for her, Quaint bound, as &apos;twere in parchment very old, That all my dearest words of her should hold. 20% left ] With his parents and Frances Weston, Pound took another three-month European tour in 1902, after which he transferred to Hamilton College in Clinton, New York – possibly because of poor grades – where he studied the Provençal dialect with William Pierce Shephard, and Old English with Joseph D. Ibbotson. David Moody writes that it was at Hamilton with Shephard that he read Dante, and out of the discussions emerged the idea for a long poem in three parts – dealing with emotion, instruction, and contemplation – which planted the seed for The Cantos. { He would later apply the form he imagined throughout the writing of the Cantos. See Moody (2007), 24 } He graduated with a BPhil in 1905, then studied Romance languages under Hugo A. Rennert at the University of Pennsylvania, obtaining his MA in the spring of 1906. He registered as a PhD student to write a thesis on the jesters in Lope de Vega &apos;s plays, and was awarded a Harrison fellowship and a travel grant of $500, which he used to visit Europe again. He spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including one in the royal palace; he was actually standing outside the palace during the attempted assassination on 31  May  1906 by anarchists of King Alfonso, and left the country for fear he would be identified with them. He moved on to Paris, spending two weeks in lectures at the Sorbonne, followed by a week in London. He returned to the U.S. in July, and his first essay, Raphaelite Latin, was published in Book News Monthly in September. In 1907 at the university, he apparently annoyed Felix Schelling, the head of English, with silly remarks during lectures – which included insisting that George Bernard Shaw was better than Shakespeare, and taking out an enormous tin watch and winding it with slow precision – and his fellowship was not renewed at the end of the year. Moreover Schelling told Pound he was wasting his own time and that of the institution; Pound abandoned his dissertation and left without finishing his doctorate. { Moody (2007), 23–24, 28–33 } [ Teaching ] In the fall of 1907 he took a job as a teacher of Romance languages at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, a conservative town that he called the sixth circle of hell, with an equally conservative college from which he was dismissed after deliberately provoking the college authorities. Smoking was forbidden, so he would smoke cigarillos in his office down the corridor from the President&apos;s. He annoyed his landlords by entertaining friends, including women, and was forced to move from one house after &quot; [t]wo stewdents found me sharing my meagre repast with a lady gent impersonator in my privut apartments, &quot; as he told a friend. He was eventually caught in flagrante, although the details remain unclear and he denied any wrongdoing. The incident involved a stranded chorus girl to whom he offered tea and his bed for the night when she was caught in a snowstorm; when she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Misses Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief, and he was asked to leave the college. Glad to be free of the place he left for Europe soon after. { Moody (2007), 59–60; Wilhelm (1985), 177; Carpenter (1988a), 80 } [ London (1908–20) ] [ Introduction to literary scene ] { The Pisan Cantos &apos;&apos; (1948). } Pound returned to Europe in the spring, arriving in Gibraltar in April with $80 in his pocket, but during the next few months earned money as a guide to American tourists. He sent poems to Harper&apos;s Magazine and began writing fiction that he hoped he could sell, and by the summer was in Venice, living over a bakery near the San Vio bridge. In July he self-published his first book of poetry, the 72-page A Lume Spento (With Tapers Spent), which sold 100 copies at six cents each. The London Evening Standard called it &quot; wild and haunting stuff, absolutely poetic, original, imaginative. &quot; The title was from the third canto of Dante &apos;s Purgatorio, alluding to both the excommunicate Manfred &apos;s death, and to that of his friend, the Philadelphia artist William Brooke Smith, who died of consumption in his 20s. For Venice, see Tytell (1987), 35 For the dedication of A Lume Spento, see Zinnes (1980) xi For his sales of A Lume Spento, see Montgomery, Paul L. &quot; Ezra Pound: A Man of Contradictions &quot;, The New York Times, 2 November 1972, accessed 12 April 2012. For the Evening Standard quote, see Eliot (1917), 5 For information about Brooke Smith, see Carpenter (1988a), 91, 95 In August he moved to London, where he ended up staying almost continuously for 12 years. He wanted to meet W.B. Yeats, the greatest living poet in Pound&apos;s view, and they became close friends, although Yeats was older by 20 years. He had sent Yeats a copy of A Lume Spento, and Yeats had replied that he found it charming. Pound told William Carlos Williams, a friend from university: &quot; London, deah old Lundon, is the place for poesy. &quot; English poets such as Maurice Hewlett, Rudyard Kipling, and Alfred Lord Tennyson had made a particular kind of Victorian verse – stirring, pompous, and propagandistic – popular with the public. James Knapp writes that Pound wanted to focus on the individual experience, the particular, the concrete, and rejected the idea of poetry as versified moral essay. { Knapp (1979), 25–27 } Arriving in the city with ₤3, he first rented a room at 8 Duchess Street in the West End, then later at 48 Langham Street, near Great Titchfield Street, just a penny bus-ride from the British Museum. The house (see right) sat across an alley from the Yorkshire Grey pub, which made an appearance decades later in the Pisan Cantos, &quot; concerning the landlady&apos;s doings / with a lodger unnamed / az waz near Gt Titchfield St. next door to the pub &quot;. Pound (2003), 80, lines 334–336 Also see Campbell, James. &quot; Home from home &quot;, The Guardian, 17 May 2008. Pound persuaded the bookseller Elkin Mathews – publisher of Yeats&apos;s Wind Among the Reeds and the Book of the Rhymer&apos;s Club – to display A Lume Spento, and by October 1908 he was being discussed around town. In December he published a second collection, A Quinzaine for This Yule, and after the death of a lecturer at the Regent Street Polytechnic he managed to acquire a position lecturing in the evenings from January to February 1909 on &quot; The Development of Literature in Southern Europe &quot;. He would spend his mornings in the British Museum Reading Room, followed by lunch at the Vienna Café on Oxford Street. { Wilhelm (2008), 3–11 } Ford Madox Ford described him, apparently tongue-in-cheek, as &quot; approach[ing] with the step of a dancer, making passes with a cane at an imaginary opponent. He would wear trousers made of green billiard cloth, a pink coat, a blue shirt, a tie hand-painted by a Japanese friend, an immense sombrero, a flaming beard cut to a point, and a single, large blue earring. &quot; { Moody (2007), 113 } [ Meeting Dorothy Shakespear, Personae ] In January 1909, Pound met the novelist Olivia Shakespear – Yeats&apos;s former lover and the subject of his The Lover Mourns for the Loss of Love – at a literary salon, and was invited to attend her Tuesday salons where he was introduced to Dorothy, Olivia&apos;s daughter, who became his wife in 1914. Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to Yeats, the artist Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Wyndham Lewis, and the rest of London&apos;s literary circle. Another patron was the American heiress Margaret Lanier Cravens (1881–1912), who after knowing him a short time offered him a large annual sum to allow him to focus on his work. Cravens killed herself in 1912, probably because the pianist Walter Rummel, long the object of her affection, married someone else, but possibly also because she learned of Pound&apos;s engagement to Dorothy. { For the money from Cravens, see Moody (2007), 124–125; for the speculation they were lovers, see Carpenter (1988), 155; Dennis (1999), 264; Pound, Omar (1988), 66 } { Dorothy Shakespear in February 1909, and they were married in April 1914. } In June 1909 another collection, Personae, was published by Mathews, Pound&apos;s first publication to have any commercial success. It was reviewed by The Daily Telegraph and the Times Literary Supplement among others; they said it was full of passion and magic. Rupert Brooke gave a negative review in The Cambridge Review, complaining that Pound had fallen under the influence of Walt Whitman by writing in &quot; unmetrical sprawling lengths &quot;. In September another 27 poems appeared as Exultations, dedicated to Carlos Tracey Chester who had published his essay in Book News Monthly in 1906. Around the same time he moved into new rooms at Church Walk, off Kensington High Street, where he lived most of the time until 1914. For Brooke&apos;s review, see Moody (2007), 91–93, and for his move to Church Walk, see p. 180.

For Exultations, see Wilson, Peter. &quot; Exultations &quot;, The Literary Encyclopedia, 20 April 2004, accessed 13 October 2010. His first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, was published in 1910, based on his lectures at the polytechnic; others included Instigations (1920), Indiscretions (1923), &quot; How to Read &quot; (1931), The ABC of Reading (1934), Make It New (1934), Polite Essays (1937), and Guide to Kulchur (1938). { Stock (1970), 70; Nadel (1999), xiv-xxv } In June 1910 Pound returned to the United States for eight months, in part to persuade the New York Public Library, then being built, to change its design. The New York Times wrote that he almost daily visited the architects&apos; offices to shout at them. { Montgomery, Paul L. &quot; Ezra Pound: A Man of Contradictions &quot;, The New York Times, 2 November 1972. } His essays on America were written during this period, and were compiled as Patria Mia, published in 1950. He loved New York but no longer felt at home there. He felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity. He suffered jaundice but nevertheless persuaded his parents to finance his passage back to Europe. It was nearly 30 years before he visited the United States again. On 22  February  1911 he sailed from New York on the R.M.S. &apos;&apos;Mauretania&apos;&apos;, arriving in Southampton six days later. After a few days in London, he visited Paris again, where he worked on a new collection of poetry, Canzoni (1911), panned by the Westminster Gazette as a &quot; medley of pretension &quot;, and spent time with Margaret Cravens. When he returned to London in August 1911, A.R. Orage, editor of the socialist journal The New Age, hired him to write a weekly column, giving him a steadier income. For his view of the U.S., see Wilhelm (2008), 62–65 For Canzoni, see Elek, Jon. &quot; Canzoni &quot;, The Literary Encyclopedia, 8 March 2005, accessed 6 October 2010. Orage also made an appearance in The Cantos (where Possum is T. S. Eliot): &quot; But the lot of &apos;em, / Yeats, Possum and Wyndham / had no ground beneath &apos;em. / Orage had. &quot; See Wilhelm (2008), 83, citing Canto 98/685. [ Imagism ] [ Des Imagistes ] [ right horizontal left/right/center footer left/right/center Church Walk, Kensington.jpg 165 Church Walk, Kensington; Pound rented rooms there between 1909 and 1914. Ezra Pound plaque in Church Walk, Kensington.jpg 185 A blue plaque on 10 Church Walk, where Pound said Imagismewas born. ] Hilda Doolittle arrived in London from Philadelphia in May 1911 with the poet Frances Gregg and Gregg&apos;s mother, and when they returned in September she decided to stay on. Pound introduced her to his friends, including the poet Richard Aldington, whom she married in 1913. Before then, the three of them lived in Church Walk – Pound at no. 10, Doolittle at no. 6, and Aldington at no. 8 – and worked daily in the British Museum Reading Room. { Moody (2007), 180 } At the museum he also met regularly with the curator and poet Laurence Binyon, who introduced him to the East Asian artistic and literary concepts that would become so vital to the imagery and technique of his later poetry. The museum&apos;s visitors&apos; books show that Pound was often to be found during 1912 and 1913 in the Print Room examining Japanese Nishiki-e inscribed with traditional Japanese waka verse, a 10th century genre of poetry whose economy and strict conventions undoubtedly contributed to Imagist techniques of composition. Arrowsmith (2011), 103–164 Also see Arrowsmith (2011), 27–42 Also see Dennis (2000), 101 Pound was at that time working on the poems that became Ripostes (1912), trying to move away from his earlier work, which he wrote later had reduced Ford Madox Ford in 1911 to rolling on the floor laughing at Pound&apos;s stilted language. He realized with his translation work that the problem lay not in his knowledge of the other languages, but in his use of English: What obfuscated me was not the Italian but the crust of dead English, the sediment present in my own available vocabulary... You can&apos;t go round this sort of thing. It takes six or eight years to get educated in one&apos;s art, and another ten to get rid of that education. &lt; p &gt; Neither can anyone learn English, one can only learn a series of Englishes. Rossetti made his own language. I hadn&apos;t in 1910 made a language, I don&apos;t mean a language to use, but even a language to think in. Venuti (1979), 88 Also see Knapp (1979), 54 He understood that to change the structure of your language is to change the way you think and see the world. While living at Church Walk in 1912, Pound, Aldington, and Doolittle started working on ideas about language that became the Imagism movement. The aim was clarity: a fight against abstraction, romanticism, rhetoric, inversion of word order, and over-use of adjectives. Pound later said they agreed in the spring or early summer of 1912 on three principles: 1. Direct treatment of the &quot; thing &quot; whether subjective or objective. 2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation. 3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome. { Pound, Ezra. &quot; A Retrospect &quot;, in T. S. Eliot. (1968). Literary Essays of Ezra Pound. New York: New Directions Publishing. 3–5; first published 1918. } Superfluous words, particularly adjectives, were to be avoided, as were expressions like &quot; dim lands of peace, &quot; which he said dulled the image by mixing the abstract with the concrete. He wrote that the natural object was always the &quot; adequate symbol. &quot; Poets should &quot; go in fear of abstractions, &quot; and should not re-tell in mediocre verse what has already been told in good prose. A classic example of the style is Pound&apos;s &quot; In a Station of the Metro &quot; (1913), inspired by an experience on the Paris Underground. &quot; I got out of a train at, I think, La Concorde, and in the jostle I saw a beautiful face, and then, turning suddenly, another and another, and then a beautiful child&apos;s face, and then another beautiful face. All that day I tried to find words for what this made me feel. &quot; He worked on the poem for a year, reducing it to its essence in the style of a Japanese haiku. Pound, Ezra. &apos;&apos;The Poetry of Ezra Pound&apos;&apos;. University of California Press, 34 For its description as the classic Imagist poem, see Witemeyer (1999), 49 It reads in its entirety: [ The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough. Albright, 60 30% center ] [ Ripostes, translation work ] { Ernest Fenollosa &apos;s unpublished notes, which led to &apos;&apos;Cathay&apos;&apos; (1915). } It was in Ripostes, submitted to Swift &amp; Co in February 1912 and published by them that October, that Pound moved toward more minimalist language, though Knapp writes that it is an uncertain volume, published when Pound had only begun his move toward Imagism; his first use of the word &quot; Imagiste &quot; was in Ripostes. Michael Alexander writes that the poems show a greater concentration of meaning and economy of rhythm than his earlier work. The collection includes five poems by the British poet T.E. Hulme, killed in Flanders in 1917 during the First World War to Pound&apos;s great distress. It also includes his translation of the 8th century Old English poem &quot; The Seafarer &quot;, not a literal translation, but a personal interpretation and a poem in its own right. It upset scholars, as did his other translations from Latin, Italian, French, and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that in some circles his translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to The Seafarer was a rehearsal for the response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919.

His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also published in 1912. [ First World War, disillusionment ] [ Lost Generation ] { Conrad Aiken showed } { T. S. Eliot &apos;s &apos;&apos; } { Prufrock &apos;&apos; to practically every editor in England; it was Pound who recognized it as a work of genius. } Between 1914 and 1916 he helped to have James Joyce&apos;s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man serialized in The Egoist then published in book form, and he persuaded Poetry to publish T. S. Eliot&apos;s &quot; The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock &quot; in June 1915. Conrad Aiken writes that he had shown &quot; Prufrock &quot; to every conceivable editor in England, but it was dismissed as crazy. He eventually sent it to Pound who, Aiken writes, instantly saw that it was a work of genius and sent it to Poetry. { Aiken (1965), 4–5 } &quot; [Eliot] has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN, &quot; Pound wrote to Monroe in October 1914. &quot; The rest of the promising young have done one or the other but never both. Most of the swine have done neither. &quot; { Mertens, Richard. &quot; Letter by letter &quot;, University of Chicago Magazine, 93.6, August 2001. } In 1919 he collected and published his essays for The Little Review into a volume called Instigations, and published &quot; Homage to Sextus Propertius &quot; in Poetry. &quot; Homage &quot; is not a strict translation; Moody describes it as &quot; the refraction of an ancient poet through a modern intelligence &quot;. Harriet Monroe, editor of Poetry, published a letter from a professor of Latin, W.G. Hale, saying that Pound was &quot; incredibly ignorant &quot; of the language, and alluded to &quot; about three-score errors &quot; in Homage. Harriet did not publish Pound&apos;s response, which began &quot; Cat-piss and porcupines!! &quot; and continued, &quot; The thing is no more a translation than my &apos;Altaforte&apos; is a translation, or than Fitzgerald &apos;s Omar is a translation... &quot; But she interpreted his silence after that as his resignation as foreign editor. { Kenner (1971), 286 } [ Hugh Selwyn Mauberley ] [ Hugh Selwyn Mauberley ] [ There died a myriad And of the best, among them, For an old bitch gone in the teeth, &lt; p &gt; For a botched civilization. 20% right ] Hugh Selwyn Mauberley – about a poet whose life, like Pound&apos;s, has become sterile and meaningless – was published in June 1920, marking his farewell to London. He was disgusted by the lives lost during the war and could not reconcile himself with it. Stephen Adams writes that, just as T. S. Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the poem, made up of 18 short poems, is nevertheless read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, then turns to social criticism and economics, and an attack on the causes of the war, the word &quot; usury &quot; appearing in his work for the first time. The critic F. R. Leavis saw it as Pound&apos;s major achievement. Adams (2005), 149 Bilan (2010), 89 Pound, Ezra. &quot; Hugh Selwyn Mauberley &quot;, the text from Project Gutenberg, 18 November 2007, accessed 20 October 2010. Also see Leavis (1932), 134, 150 The war had shattered Pound&apos;s belief in modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own future as a poet. He had only the New Age to write for, with other magazines ignoring his submissions or not reviewing his work. Toward the end of 1920 he and Dorothy decided their time in London was over, and resolved to move to Paris. { Moody (2007), 394–396 } A. R. Orage wrote in the January  1921 issue of The New Age: Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country  .... Mr. Pound has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England  ... however, Mr. Pound  ... has made more enemies than friends. Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. { Moody (2007), 410 } [ Paris (1921–24) ] [ Le Testament de Villon ] { The Pounds settled in Paris in January 1921 in an inexpensive apartment at 70 bis, rue Notre Dame des Champs. He became friendly with } { Marcel Duchamp, } { Tristan Tzara, } { Fernand Léger and others of the } { Dada and } { Surrealist movements, as well as } { Basil Bunting, Ernest Hemingway, and his wife } { Hadley. He spent most of his time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore } { Shakespeare and Company, and in 1921 his Poems 1918–1921 was published. In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of &quot; } { The Waste Land &quot;, he had arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound who } { blue-inked the manuscript with comments like &quot; make up yr. mind... &quot; and &quot; georgian. &quot; Badenhausen (2004), 84 } { Eliot wrote: &quot; I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound&apos;s critical genius. &quot; } { Olga Rudge in 1922. } In 1924 Pound secured funding for Ford Madox Ford&apos;s transatlantic review from American attorney John Quinn. The review published works by Pound, Hemingway and Gertrude Stein, as well as extracts from Joyce&apos;s Finnegans Wake, before the money ran out in 1925. The review published a number of Pound music reviews, later collected into Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony. { Carpenter (1988a), 430–431, 448 } Hemingway asked Pound, who had gained a reputation as &quot; an unofficial minister of culture who acted as mid-wife for new literary talent &quot;, to blue-ink his short stories. Although Hemingway was 14  years younger, the two forged a relationship of mutual respect and friendship, living on the same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923; as Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers writes, &quot; They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other&apos;s work &quot;, with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound&apos;s teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told Sherwood Anderson, &quot; [Ezra] habitually leads with his chin and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish &quot;. { Meyers (1985), 70–74 } Pound was 36 when he met the American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in the fall of 1922, beginning a love affair that lasted 50 years. John Tytell writes that Pound had always felt there was a link between his creativity and his ability to seduce women, something Dorothy had turned a blind eye to over the years. He complained shortly after arriving in Paris that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga, then 26, at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: she was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio steel family, living in her mother&apos;s Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. For his need of a mistress, see Tytell (1987), 180 For their belonging to different circles, see Wilhelm (2008), 251 They spent the following summer in the south of France, where he worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He also wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed. For his operas, see Kenner (1973), 390 For his pieces for violin, see Stock (1970), 252–256 [ Italy (1924–45) ] [ Birth of the children ] { Rapallo in 1924. &quot; Italy is my place for starting things, &quot; he said. } The Pounds were unhappy in Paris. Dorothy was complaining about the winters, and Pound&apos;s health was poor. At a dinner someone had randomly tried to stab him and it underlined that their time in France was over. Hemingway wrote that Pound &quot; indulged in a small nervous breakdown necessitating spending two days in the Am. Hospital (American Hospital). &quot; { Baker (1981), 127 } They decided to move to a quieter place, and chose Rapallo, Italy, a town with a population of 15,000. &quot; Italy is my place for starting things, &quot; he told a friend. { Tytell (1987), 191–193 } Olga Rudge followed them there, carrying Pound&apos;s child. She apparently had no interest in raising a child, but Tytell writes that she felt having one would keep her connected to him. She gave birth to a daughter, Mary, on 9 July 1925 in Brixen, and the baby was handed over to a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary (later de Rachewiltz) for 200 lire a month. When Pound told Dorothy about the birth she separated from him for much of that year and the next, and in March 1926 – after returning from a three-month visit to Egypt – she announced that she too was pregnant. She and Pound left Rapallo for Paris for the premiere of Le Testament de Villon, without mentioning the pregnancy to Pound&apos;s friends or parents, and on 10  September  1926 Hemingway drove her to the American Hospital of Paris for the birth of a son, Omar. In a letter to his parents in October Pound wrote, &quot; next generation (male) arrived. Both D &amp; it appear to be doing well. &quot; Dorothy handed the baby over to her mother, Olivia, who raised him in London until he was old enough to go to boarding school. When Dorothy went to England each summer to see Omar, Pound would spend the time with Olga, whose father had bought her a house in Venice. The arrangement meant his children were raised very differently. Mary had one pair of shoes and books about Jesus and the saints, while Omar was raised as an English gentleman in Kensington by his sophisticated grandmother. For more about the woman who raised Mary, and Pound telling Dorothy, see Wilhelm (1994), 13–15 Also see Carpenter (1988a), 448 For Mary&apos;s memoir, see de Rachewiltz(1971), 11 In 1925 the literary magazine This Quarter dedicated its first issue to Pound, including tributes from Hemingway and Joyce. Pound published Cantos 17–19 in the winter editions. In March 1927 he launched his own literary magazine, The Exile, but only four issues were published. It did well in the first year, with contributions from Hemingway, E. E. Cummings, Basil Bunting, Yeats, William Carlos Williams and Robert McAlmon. J.J. Wilhelm argues that some of the worst work came from Pound himself in the form of rambling editorials about Confucianism and praise of Lenin. { Wilhelm (1994), 22–24 } He continued to work on Fenollosa&apos;s manuscripts, and in 1928 won The Dial &apos;s poetry award for his translation of the Confucian classic Great Learning (Dà Xué, which Pound transliterated as Ta Hio). { Nadel (1999), xxi–xxiii } That year Homer and Isabel visited him in Rapallo. They had not seen him since 1914, and by then Homer had retired so they decided to move to Rapallo themselves, taking a small house, Villa Raggio, on a hill above the town. { Tytell (1987), 197–198, 218 } [ The Cantos ] [ List of cultural references in The Cantos ] Pound on the cover of &apos;&apos;Pavannes and Divisions&apos;&apos; (1918) The bulk of Pound&apos;s work on The Cantos began after his move to Italy. Like all the other great epics, it is the story of good and evil, a descent into hell and progress to paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groups: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to paradiso terrestre. He began work on it in 1915, but there were several false starts and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922. { Terrell, Carroll F. (1980). &apos;&apos;A Companion to The Cantos of Ezra Pound&apos;&apos;. Berkeley: University of California Press, vii } The subject matter ranges from Odysseus, Troy, Dionysus, Malatesta, Confucius, and Napoleon, to Jefferson and Mussolini, Chinese history, Pisa, and usury, relying on memories, diaries, jokes, hymns, anecdotes, ideogrammic translation, and up to 15  different languages. Allen Tate, who supported Pound for the Bollingen Prize for the sections of The Cantos known as the Pisan Cantos, writes that the poem is not about anything, and has no beginning, middle, or end. He argues that Pound was incapable of sustained thought and was &quot; at the mercy of random flights of &apos;angelic insight,&apos; Icarian self-indulgences of prejudices. &quot; { Tate (1965), np } The first three cantos, now known as the ur-Cantos, appeared in Poetry in June–August 1917. The Malatesta Cantos (Cantos VIII, IX, X, and XI of a Long Poem) appeared in The Criterion in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in the transatlantic review in January 1924. Pound published 90 copies in Paris in 1925 A Draft of XVI. Cantos of Ezra Pound for the Beginning of a Poem of some Length now first made into a Book. { Bush (1976), xiii–xv } It was followed by A Draft of XXX Cantos (1930), Eleven New Cantos XXI–XLI (1934), The Fifth Decade of Cantos (1937), Cantos LII–LXXI (1940), The Pisan Cantos (1948), written while in custody in Pisa, and Seventy Cantos (1950). The first complete edition was published in 1964 as The Cantos (1–109), { Alexander (1979), 122, 128–129, 134 } followed by Drafts and Fragments: Cantos CX-CXVII (1968). [ Turn to fascism, Second World War ] Pound came to believe during the 1920s that the cause of the First World War was finance capitalism, which he called &quot; usury, &quot; and that the solution was C.H. Douglas &apos;s idea of social credit, with fascism as the vehicle for reform; he had met Douglas in The New Age offices and had been impressed by his ideas. { Preda (2005), 90 } He presented a series of lectures on economics, and made contact with politicians in the United States about education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30  January  1933 Pound met Mussolini himself. Olga Rudge had played for Mussolini and had told him about Pound; Pound had already sent him a copy of Cantos XXX. During the meeting he tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Tytell writes that Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the Cantos &quot; divertente &quot; (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in Canto 41: &quot; &apos;Ma questo&apos; / said the boss, &apos;è divertente.&apos; &quot;. Pound told Douglas that he had &quot; never met anyone who seemed to GET my ideas so quickly as the boss. &quot; { Tytell (1987), 228–232 } A number of Pound&apos;s books were published in the 1930s, including ABC of Economics (1933), ABC of Reading (1934), Social Credit: An Impact (1935), Jefferson and/or Mussolini (1936), and A Guide to Kulchur (1938). In 1936 James Laughlin – who had visited him in Rapallo in 1933 as a 20-year-old student – set up New Directions Publishing, and acted as Pound&apos;s agent, finding publications to accept his work and writing reviews. { Barnhisel (2005), 3 } When Dorothy&apos;s mother died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to organize the funeral, where he met their 12-year-old son Omar for the first time in eight years. He visited T. S. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America from involvement in the Second World War, happy to answer reporters&apos; questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. Mary said he did it out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and left depressed and frustrated. { Tytell (1987), 250–253 } While in America, Pound received an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College on 12 June 1939, and a week later he returned to Italy, where he began writing antisemitic material for Italian newspapers, including one entitled &quot; The Jews, Disease Incarnate. &quot; He wrote to James Laughlin that Roosevelt represented Jewry, and signed the letter &quot; Heil Hitler. &quot; He started writing for Action, a newspaper owned by the British fascist, Sir Oswald Mosley, arguing that the Third Reich was the &quot; natural civilizer of Russia. &quot; After war broke out in September that year, he began a furious letter-writing campaign to the politicians he had petitioned six months earlier, arguing that the war was the result of an international banking conspiracy, and that the United States should keep out of it. { Tytell (1987), 253–265 } [ Radio broadcasts ] [ You let in the Jew and the Jew rotted your empire, and you yourselves out-jewed the Jew  ... And the big Jew has rotted EVERY nation he has wormed into. 30% right ] Tytell writes that by the 1940s no American or English poet had been so active politically since William Blake. Pound had written over a thousand letters a year during the previous decade, and had presented his ideas in hundreds of articles, as well as in The Cantos. According to Tytell, Pound&apos;s fear was an economic structure that depended on the armaments industry, where the profit motive alone would govern war and peace. He started reading George Santayana, and The Law of Civilization and Decay by Brooks Adams, finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant. He wrote in The Japan Times that &quot; Democracy is now currently defined in Europe as a &apos;country run by Jews,&apos; &quot; and told Oswald Mosley&apos;s newspaper the English were a slave race governed by the Rothschilds since Waterloo. Pound broadcast over Rome Radio, though the Italian government was at first reluctant, concerned he might be a double agent. He told a friend: &quot; It took me, I think it was, TWO years, insistence and wrangling etc., to GET HOLD of their microphone. &quot; He recorded just over a hundred broadcasts, and traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17. The broadcasts required the Italian government&apos;s approval in advance, though he often changed the text in the studio. The politics apart, he needed the money. Tytell writes that his voice had assumed a &quot; rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar. &quot; He continued to occasionally broadcast, and writing under pseudonyms until about April 1945, shortly before his arrest. For the quote from Pound, the payments, his traveling to Rome for the broadcasts, and the indictment, see Tytell (1987), 253, 265, 267 For the title of the first broadcast, see Redman (1991), 158 For the number of broadcasts and dates, see Gill (2005), 115–116 For the references to &quot; kikes, &quot; see Michael (2008), 174 For the transcripts of the broadcasts, see Doob (1978) [ Arrest for treason ] [ Allied invasion of Italy ] A few weeks later he returned south via Milan to Olga and Dorothy. They had been living in Isabel&apos;s apartment, but it was small so they decided to move in with Olga at Sant&apos; Ambrogio. His daughter Mary, then 19, was sent to Gais in Switzerland, leaving Pound, as she wrote, &quot; pent up with two women who loved him, whom he loved, and who coldly hated each other. &quot; He was in Rome when the Allies landed in Sicily in July  1943. Pound borrowed a pair of hiking boots and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. He traveled 450 miles north, spending a night in an air raid shelter in Bologna, and taking a train part of the way to Verona. She almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later said she felt more pity than anger. { Tytell (1987), 272–273 } [ right horizontal left/right/center footer left/right/center Ezra Pound 1945 May 26 mug shot.jpg 142 Taken at the Army Disciplinary Training Center Photograph of a man Security cages where Ezra Pound was held, Pisa, Italy, 1945.JPG 178 The &quot; death cells &quot; in Pisa Photograph of steel-cages ] He returned to Rapallo, where on 2  May  1945, four days after Mussolini was shot, armed partisans arrived at the house while Pound was there alone. He stuffed a copy of Confucius and a Chinese dictionary in his pocket, and was taken to their HQ in Chiavari, although he was released shortly afterwards. He and Olga then gave themselves up to an American military post in the nearby town of Lavagna. It was decided that Pound should be transported to U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps headquarters in Genoa, where he was interrogated by Frank L. Amprin, the FBI agent assigned by J. Edgar Hoover to gather evidence following the 1943 indictment. Pound asked permission to send a cable to President Truman to offer to help negotiate peace with Japan. He also asked to deliver a final broadcast from a script called &quot; Ashes of Europe Calling, &quot; in which he recommended peace with Japan, American management of Italy, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and leniency toward Germany. His requests were denied and the script forwarded to Hoover. { Sieburth (2003), ix–xiv } On 8  May, the day Germany surrendered, he told a reporter from the Philadelphia Record who had managed to get into the compound for an interview that Hitler was &quot; a Jeanne d&apos;Arc, a saint, &quot; and that Mussolini was an &quot; imperfect character who lost his head. &quot; On 24  May he was transferred to the United States Army Disciplinary Training Center north of Pisa, used to house military personnel awaiting court martial. The temporary commander placed him in one of the camp&apos;s &quot; death cells, &quot; a series of six-by-six-foot outdoor steel cages lit up all night by floodlights. He was left for three weeks in isolation in the heat, denied exercise, eyes inflamed by dust, no bed, no belt, no shoelaces, and no communication with the guards, except for the chaplain. After two and a half weeks he began to break down under the strain. Richard Sieburth writes that he recorded it in Canto 80, where Odysseus is saved from drowning by Leucothea : &quot; hast&apos;ou swum in a sea of air strip / through an aeon of nothingness, / when the raft broke and the waters went over me. &quot; Medical staff moved him out of the cage the following week. On 14 and 15 June he was examined by psychiatrists, one of whom found symptoms of a mental breakdown, and he was transferred to his own officer&apos;s tent and allowed reading material. He began to write, and drafted what became known as The Pisan Cantos; the existence of a few sheets of toilet paper showing the beginning of Canto LXXXIV suggests he started it while in the cage. [ United States (1945–58) ] [ St Elizabeths ] [ Visits to St. Elizabeths ] The main building of St Elizabeths hospital, now boarded up and abandoned. On 15  November, 1945, Pound was transferred to the United States. An escorting officer&apos;s impression was that &quot; he is an intellectual &apos;crackpot&apos; who imagined that he could correct all the economic ills of the world and who resented the fact that ordinary mortals were not sufficiently intelligent to understand his aims and motives. &quot; { Kimpel (1981), 470–474 } On 25  November he was arraigned in Washington D.C. on cha rges of treason. The charges included broadcasting for the enemy, attempting to persuade American citizens to undermine government support of the war, and strengthening morale in Italy against the United States. [ This is the soldier home from the war. These are the years and the walls and the door that shut on a boy that pats the floor to see if the world is round or flat. This is a Jew in a newspaper hat that dances carefully down the ward, walking the plank of a coffin board with the crazy sailor that shows his watch that tells the time of the wretched man that lies in the house of Bedlam. 25% left ] He was admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital – where in June 1946 Dorothy was declared his legal guardian – and held for a time in the hospital&apos;s prison ward, Howard&apos;s Hall, known as the &quot; hell-hole, &quot; a building without windows in a room with a thick steel door and nine peepholes, which allowed the psychiatrists to observe him while they tried to agree on a diagnosis. Visitors were allowed only for 15 minutes at a time, while other patients wandered around outside the room screaming and frothing at the mouth, according to T. S. Eliot. Pound&apos;s lawyer, Julien Cornell, whose efforts to have him declared insane are credited with having saved him from life imprisonment, requested his release at a bail hearing in January 1947. { For Cornell&apos;s efforts, see &quot; Julien Cornell, 83, The Defense Lawyer In Ezra Pound Case &quot;, The New York Times, 7 December 1994. } The hospital&apos;s superintendent, Winfred Overholser, agreed instead to move him to the more pleasant surroundings of Chestnut Ward, close to Overholser&apos;s private quarters, which is where he spent the next 12 years. The historian Stanley Kutler was given access in the 1980s to military intelligence and other government documents about Pound, including his hospital records, and wrote that the psychiatrists believed Pound had a narcissistic personality, but they considered him sane. Kutler said that Overholser protected Pound from the criminal justice system because he was fascinated by him. { Mitgang, Herbert. &quot; Researchers dispute Ezra Pound&apos;s &apos;insanity&apos;, &quot; The New York Times, 31 October 1981. } Tytell argues that Pound was in his element in Chestnut Ward. He was at last provided for, and was allowed to read, write, and receive visitors, including Dorothy for several hours a day. He took over a small alcove with wicker chairs just outside his room, and turned it into his private living room, where he entertained his friends and important literary figures. He began work on his translation of Sophocles &apos;s Women of Trachis and Electra, and continued work on The Cantos. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release. She wrote to a friend: &quot; E.P. has... bats in the belfry but it strikes me that he has fewer not more than before his incarceration. &quot; { Tytell (1987), 289–297, 304–305 } [ The Pisan Cantos, Bollingen Prize ] { The Pisan Cantos &apos;&apos;, suggesting Pound may have begun it while in the steel cage } James Laughlin had Cantos 74–84 ready for publication in 1946 under the title The Pisan Cantos, and even gave Pound an advance copy, but he had held it back, waiting for an appropriate time to publish. Tytell writes that in June 1948 a group of Pound&apos;s friends – Eliot, Cummings, W. H. Auden, Allen Tate, and Julien Cornell – met Laughlin to discuss how to get him released. According to the poet Archibald MacLeish, the men conceived a plan to have Pound awarded the first Bollingen Prize, a new national poetry award just announced by the Library of Congress, with $1,000 prize money donated by the Mellon family. The awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the Library of Congress, including several of Pound&apos;s supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, Amy Lowell, Katherine Anne Porter, and Theodore Spencer. The idea was that the Justice Department would be placed in an untenable position if Pound won a major award and was not released. Laughlin published The Pisan Cantos on 30 July 1948, and the following year the prize went to Pound. There were two dissenting voices, Katherine Garrison Chapin, the wife of Francis Biddle, the Attorney General who had indicted Pound for treason, and Karl Shapiro, who said that he could not vote for an antisemite because he was Jewish himself. Pound&apos;s response to the news of the award was, &quot; No comment from the bughouse. &quot; Tytell (1987), 293, 302–303 For more details of who supported and opposed, see McGuire (1988) For MacLeish&apos;s position, Tytell cites MacLeish, Archibald. &apos;&apos;Riders on the Earth&apos;&apos;, Houghton Mifflin, 1978, 120; Winnick, R.H.

Also see Sieburth (2003), xxxviii–xxxix. Sieburth writes: &quot; At their [the committee&apos;s first] meeting [in November 1948], and to no one&apos;s great surprise, given [Allen] Tate&apos;s behind-the-scenes maneuverings and the intimidating presence of recent Nobel Laureate T. S. Eliot, The Pisan Cantos emerged as the major contender... &quot; See Sieburth (above) for Pound&apos;s response. The Associated Press reported the list of judges as Conrad Aiken, W. H. Auden, Louise Bogan, Katherine Garrison Chapin, T. S. Eliot, Paul Green, Robert Lowell, Katherine Anne Porter, Karl Shapiro, Allen Tate, Willard Thorp, and Robert Penn Warren. Also on the list of judges were Leonie Adams, the Library of Congress&apos;s poetry consultant, and Theodore Spencer, who died on 18 January 1949, just before the award was announced. See &quot; Pound, in Mental Clinic, Wins Prize for Poetry Penned in Treason Cell &quot;, The New York Times, 19 February 1949, accessed 12 April 2012. There was uproar. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted critics who said &quot; poetry [cannot] convert words into maggots that eat at human dignity and still be good poetry. &quot; Robert Hillyer, a Pulitzer Prize winner and president of the Poetry Society of America, attacked the committee in The Saturday Review of Literature, telling journalists that he &quot; never saw anything to admire in Pound, not one line. &quot; &quot; Canto Controversy &quot; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 22 August 1949, accessed 12 April 2012.

Javits demanded an investigation into the awards committee, and as a result it was the last time the prize was administered by the Library of Congress. [ Controversial friendships, release ] Although Pound repudiated his antisemitism in public, Tytell writes that in private it continued. He often refused to talk to psychiatrists with Jewish-sounding names, would refer to people he disliked as Jews, and urged his visitors to read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (1903), a fabrication claiming to represent a Jewish plan for world domination. He struck up a friendship during the 1950s with the writer Eustace Mullins, believed to be associated with the Aryan League of America, who wrote a biography of Pound, This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound (1961). { Wilhelm (1994), 286, 306 } Even more damaging was his friendship with a far-right activist and member of the Ku Klux Klan, John Kasper. Kasper had come to admire Pound during some literature classes at university, and after he wrote to Pound in 1950 the two became friends. Kasper opened a bookstore in Greenwich Village in 1953 called &quot; Make it New, &quot; reflecting his commitment to Pound&apos;s ideas; it specialized in far-right material, including Nazi literature, and Pound&apos;s poetry and translations were displayed in the window. { Hickman (2005), 127 } Kasper and another follower of Pound&apos;s, David Horton, set up a publishing imprint, Square Dollar Series, which Pound used as a vehicle for his tracts about economic reform. Kasper was eventually jailed for the 1957 bombing of the Hattie Cotton School in Nashville, targeted because a black girl had registered as a student. Tytell (1987), 306–308 Also see &quot; Police Firmness in Nashville &quot;, Life magazine, 23 September 1957, 34, accessed 12 April 2012. Wilhelm writes that there were a lot of perfectly respectable people visiting Pound too, such as the classicist J.P. Sullivan and the writer Guy Davenport, but it was the association with Mullins and Kasper that stood out. The relationships delayed his release from St Elizabeths. Eliot&apos;s friends continued to try to get him out. Shortly after Hemingway won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954, he told Time magazine that &quot; this would be a good year to release poets. &quot; MacLeish asked him in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound&apos;s behalf; Hemingway believed Pound was unable to abstain from awkward political statements or from friendships with people like Kasper, but he signed a letter of support anyway, and pledged $1,500 to be given to Pound when he was released. For the money from Hemingway, see Reynolds (2000), 303 For the Hemingway quote, see Goacher, Dennis. Foreword in Ezra Pound. &apos;&apos;Women of Trachis&apos;&apos;. New Directions Publishing, 1985, p. ix. In 1957 several publications began campaigning for his release. Le Figaro published an appeal entitled &quot; The Lunatic at St Elizabeths. &quot; The New Republic, Esquire and The Nation followed suit; The Nation argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man, but that he had rights too. In 1958 MacLeish hired Thurman Arnold, a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital&apos;s superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit saying Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose. { Lewis, Anthony. &apos;&apos;U.S. asked to end Pound indictment &quot;, The New York Times, 14 April 1958. } The motion was heard on 18 April that year by the same judge who had committed him to St Elizabeths. The Department of Justice did not oppose the motion, and Pound was free. { Tytell (1987), 325–326 } [ Italy (1958–72) ] [ I did not enter into silence, silence captured me. 30% right ] Pound arrived in Naples in July, where he was photographed giving a fascist salute by the waiting press. When asked by the press when he had been released from the mental hospital, he replied: &quot; I never was. When I left the hospital I was still in America, and all America is an insane asylum. &quot; { &quot; Pound, in Italy, Gives Fascist Salute; Calls United States an &apos;Insane Asylum&apos; &quot;, The New York Times, 10 July 1958, accessed 12 April 2012. } He and Dorothy went to live with Mary at Castle Brunnenburg near Merano in the Province of South Tyrol – where he met his grandson, Walter, and his granddaughter, Patrizia, for the first time – then returned to Rapallo, where Olga Rudge was waiting to join them. They were accompanied by a teacher Pound had met in hospital, Marcella Spann, 40 years younger than him, who was ostensibly acting as his secretary, collecting poems for an anthology. The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; Canto 113 alluded to it: &quot; Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell. &quot; Pound was in love with Marcella, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in Canto CXIII: &quot; The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill. &quot; Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Marcella was seen off, sent back to America. Pound wrote to Hemingway: &quot; Old man him tired. &quot; Tytell (1987), 328–332 For the fascist salute, see &quot; Pound, in Italy, Gives Fascist Salute; Calls United States an &apos;Insane Asylum&apos; &quot;, The New York Times, 10 July 1958, accessed 12 April 2012. For the reference to Canto 113, see Sieburth (2003), xl By December  1959 he had fallen into a depression, insisting his work was worthless and The Cantos were botched. In a 1960 interview given in Rome to Donald Hall for Paris Review, he said: &quot; You—find me—in fragments. &quot; Hall wrote that he seemed in an &quot; abject despair, accidie, meaninglessness, abulia, waste. &quot; He paced up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then suddenly sagging, and at one point seemed about to collapse. Hall said it was clear that he &quot; doubted the value of everything he had done in his life. &quot; Those close to him thought he was suffering from dementia, and in the summer of 1960 Mary placed him in a clinic near Merano when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by the spring of 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went that summer to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. He attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The next year he told an interviewer, Grazia Levi, &quot; I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered  .... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing. And so words became devoid of meaning. &quot; Tytell (1987), 333–336 For the Hall interview, see Hall, Donald. &quot; Ezra Pound, The Art of Poetry No. 5 &quot;, The Paris Review, No. 28, Summer-Fall 1962. Also see Hall (1992) { Isola di San Michele } William Carlos Williams died in 1963, followed two years later by T. S. Eliot. Pound attended Eliot&apos;s funeral in London and traveled to Dublin to visit Yeats&apos;s widow. Allen Ginsberg visited him in Rapallo in October 1967. He described his work to Ginsberg as: &quot; A mess  ... my writing, stupidity and ignorance all the way through, &quot; and in the Pensione Alle Salute da Cici restaurant in Venice, he told Ginsberg, Peter Russell, and Michael Reck: &quot;... but my worst mistake was the stupid suburban anti-Semitic prejudice, all along that spoiled everything... I found after seventy years that I was not a lunatic but a moron... I should have been able to do better... &quot; Morgan, Bill. (2008). &apos;&apos;The Letters of Allen Ginsberg&apos;&apos;, De Capo Press, 340 For the meeting in the restaurant, see Reck, Michael; Weiss, Theodore; Kazin, Afred; and Taplin, Oliver. &quot; An Exchange on Ezra Pound &quot;, The New York Review of Books, 9 October 1986, accessed 12 April 2012. The above exchange was in response to Kazin, Alfred. &quot; The Fascination and Terror of Ezra Pound &quot;, The New York Review of Books, 13 March 1986, accessed 12 April 2012. Two years later Pound went to New York for the opening of an exhibition that featured his blue-inked version of Eliot&apos;s The Waste Land, { Nadel (2007), 18 } and received a standing ovation at Hamilton College when he accompanied Laughlin who was receiving an honorary doctorate. Shortly before his death in 1972 it was proposed he be awarded the Emerson-Thoreau Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, but after a storm of protest the academy&apos;s council opposed it by 13 to 9. The sociologist Daniel Bell, who was on the committee, argued that it was important to distinguish between those who explore hate and those who approve it. Two weeks before his 87th birthday he read for a gathering of friends at a café: &quot; re USURY / I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is AVARICE. &quot; { Tytell (1987), 337–339 } On his birthday he was too weak to leave his bedroom at his home on the Piazza San Marco, and the following night he was admitted to the Civil Hospital of Venice, where he died in his sleep of an intestinal blockage on 1  November, aged 87, with Olga at his side. Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, Isola di San Michele, where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Tytell (1987), 339 Also see &quot; Ezra Pound Dies in Venice at Age of 87 &quot;, The New York Times, 2 November 1972, accessed 12 April 2012. Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound. [ Reception ] Do not move Let the Gods forgive what I Let those I love try to forgive [ Let the wind speak that is paradise. have made what I have made. 22% right ] Opinion varies about the nature of Pound&apos;s writing style. Critics generally agree that he was a strong lyricist, particularly in his early work. Scholars such as Ira Nadel see evidence of modernism in his poetry before he began the Cantos, and Witmeyer argues that, as early as Ripostes, a modern style is evident. His style drew on literature from a variety of disciplines. Nadel writes that he wanted his poetry to represent an &quot; objective presentation of material which he believed could stand on its own, &quot; without use of symbolism or romanticism. The Chinese writing system most closely met his ideals. He used Chinese ideograms to represent &quot; the thing in pictures, &quot; and from Noh theater learned that plot could be replaced by a single image. Nadel (1999), 1–6 Witmeyer (1999), 47 For strong lyricist, see O&apos;Connor (1963), 7 Nadel argues that imagism was to change Pound&apos;s poetry. He explains, &quot; Imagism evolved as a reaction against abstraction  ...  replacing Victorian generalities with the clarity in Japanese haiku and ancient Greek lyrics. &quot; Pound scholar Daniel Albright writes that Pound tried to condense and eliminate &quot; all but the hardest kernel &quot; from a poem such as the two-line poem &quot; In a Station of the Metro &quot;. This, however, was a technique that did not lend itself well to the writing of an epic such as the Cantos, and so Pound turned to the more dynamic structure of what he considered Vorticism for the Cantos. { Albright (1999), 60 } [ Translations ] In Pound&apos;s Fenollosa translations, unlike previous American translators of Chinese poetry, who tended to work with strict metrical and stanza ic patterns, Pound created free verse translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations continues to be a source of controversy. Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that the use of language in Pound&apos;s translation of the Old English poem &quot; The Seafarer &quot; is deliberate, avoiding merely &quot; trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language &quot;. After his work with The Seafarer, it was in the Japanese Noh plays that he found an answer to his search for anti-naturalist minimalism which occurred just prior to his initial work with Fenellosa&apos;s papers, leading to the translation of 14 Chinese poems in Cathay, published in 1915. Neither Pound nor Fenollosa spoke or read Chinese proficiently, and Pound has been criticized for omitting or adding sections to his poems which have no basis in the original texts, though critics argue that the fidelity of Cathay to the original Chinese is beside the point. { Ming (1999), 204–212 } Hugh Kenner, in a chapter &quot; The Invention of China &quot; from The Pound Era, contends that Cathay should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship with an effort to &quot; rethink the nature of an English poem &quot;. These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West. { Kenner (1971), 199 } Michael Alexander writes that, as a translator, Pound was a pioneer with a great gift of language and an incisive intelligence. He helped popularize major poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Du Fu and brought Provençal and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive at a time when classical education was in decline, and poets no longer considered translations central to their craft. { Alexander (1997), 23-30 } [ Legacy ] His own work apart, Pound was responsible for advancing the careers of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century. In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, and Hemingway, he befriended and helped Marianne Moore, Louis Zukofsky, Jacob Epstein, Basil Bunting, E.E. Cummings, Margaret Anderson, George Oppen, and Charles Olson. { Bornstein (1999), 22–23 } Hugh Witemeyer argues that the Imagist movement was the most important in 20th-century English language poetry because hardly any prominent poet of Pound&apos;s generation and the two generations after him was untouched by it. As early as 1917 Carl Sandburg wrote in Poetry: &quot; All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant. Or he may be classed as filling a niche today like that of Keats in a preceding epoch. The point is, he will be mentioned. &quot; For Witemeyer&apos;s point, see Witemeyer (1999), 48 For the Sandburg quote, see Eliot (1917), 3 Beyond this, Pound&apos;s legacy is mixed. Hugh Kenner wrote in 1951 that there was no great contemporary writer less read than Pound, though he added that there was also no one who could appeal through &quot; sheer beauty of language &quot; to people who would rather talk about poets than read them. { Kenner (1983), 16 } The British poet Philip Larkin criticized him, &quot; for being literary, which to me is the foundation of his feebleness, thinking that poetry is made out of poetry and not out of being alive. &quot; { Letters to Monica, p.318, letter to } { Monica Jones, 9 May 1963 } His antisemitism became central to an evaluation of his poetry, including whether it was read at all. Wendy Stallard Flory argues that the best approach to The Cantos – separating the poetry from the antisemitism – is perceived as apologetic. Her view is that the establishment of Pound as &quot; National Monster &quot; and &quot; designated fascist intellectual &quot; made him a stand-in for the silent majority in Germany, occupied France and Belgium, as well as Britain and the United States who, she argues, made the Holocaust possible by aiding or standing quietly by. { Flory (1999), 285–286, 294–300 } The outrage after the treason charge was so deep that the imagined method of his execution dominated the discussion. Arthur Miller considered him worse than Hitler: &quot; In his wildest moments of human vilification Hitler never approached our Ezra  ... he knew all America&apos;s weaknesses and he played them as expertly as Goebbels ever did. &quot; The response went so far as to denounce all modernists as fascists, and it was only in the 1980s that critics began a re-evaluation. The critic Macha Rosenthal wrote that it was &quot; as if all the beautiful vitality and all the brilliant rottenness of our heritage in its luxuriant variety were both at once made manifest &quot; in Ezra Pound.
