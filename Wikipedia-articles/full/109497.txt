The name Marathon dates back to the origin of the Florida East Coast Railroad. The name came about by the railroad workers who were working night and day to complete the railway – due to the unrelenting pace and struggle to complete the project, many of the workers complained that &quot; this [the project] is getting to be a real Marathon &quot;, and was later used to name the local station along the railroad. { History of Marathon } [ Economy &amp; amp; Infrastructure ] Marathon is a major sportsfishing destination, with several charter fishing boats departing from local marinas every morning to both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Bountiful reefs around Marathon make it a popular diving, snorkeling, spearfishing, and lobster tickling area. One of the last untouched tropical hardwood hammocks in the Keys is found at Crane Point Museum, just a few miles west of Florida Keys Marathon Airport. This airport is also one of the most reliable sites in the entire United States to see the hard-to-find Antillean Nighthawk. Like the rest of the Keys in summer, Gray Kingbird are often seen on telephone wires along US 1 and Black-whiskered Vireo incessantly sing in the hammocks. Marathon is the home of the Fisherman&apos;s Hospital in the west end of the city. It is one of just three hospitals in the Florida Keys. Marathon is home to another &quot; hospital &quot; – The Turtle Hospital, one of a handful of facilities in the United States with the ability to rescue, rehabilitate, and release injured sea turtle s.
