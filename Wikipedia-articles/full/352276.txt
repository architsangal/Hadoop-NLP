The whole of the River Teme was designated as an SSSI, by English Nature, in 1996. The river is crossed by a number of historic bridges including one at Tenbury Wells that was rebuilt by Thomas Telford following flood damage in 1795. { Teme Valley Times, Spring 2007, p2 } It is also crossed, several times, by the Elan aqueduct. { Bing aerial imagery; OpenStreetMap } [ Etymology ] The name Teme is similar to many other river names in England, testament to the name&apos;s ancient origin. Similar names include River Team, River Thames, River Thame, River Tame and River Tamar. Scholars now believe these names and the older names Temese and Tamesis derive from Brythonic Tamesa, possibly meaning &apos;the dark one&apos;. { Ekwall, E., English Place-Names (4th ed), OUP, 1960, ISBN 0-19-869103-3, pp 459, 463, 464 } [ Geography ] Source of the River Teme The river source is in Mid Wales on Cilfaesty Hill in the Kerry Hills near Dolfor, south of Newtown. Two other rivers - the River Ithon and the River Mule - rise within 500 metres. It flows across the border into England through Knighton. From there to its confluence with the River Severn, at Worcester (about 60 miles/100  km downstream) it flows through the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire. The upper reaches of the river are usually steep with fast flowing but relatively shallow waters. There are some water mill s, and a number of weir s, including several at the historic town of Ludlow. Below Tenbury Wells the river is more tranquil but still shallow, with strong cross currents. Water levels in the Teme are highly variable, something which has been made worse in recent years through increases in water extraction for agriculture use. { Wendy Thompson &apos;&apos;Improving access for canoeing on inland waterways: A study of the feasibility of access agreements&apos;&apos; for the } { Countryside Agency September 2003 } River Teme at Ludlow During its journey the river flows over Upper Ludlow shales and Devonian sandstones. { The Teme Valley a blog on the Herfordshre &amp; Worcestershire Earth Heritage Trust website } The River Clun flows into the Teme at Leintwardine in north Herefordshire. The River Corve flows into the Teme just outside Ludlow and the Ledwyche Brook flows into the Teme at Burford on the Herefordshire/Shropshire border. The Kyre Brook flows into the Teme at Tenbury Wells, and the River Rea flows into the Teme at Newnham Bridge, Worcestershire, a few miles south of Cleobury Mortimer, a small Shropshire town. The Teme falls nearly 500 metres during its length from a height of 506 metres above sea level at its source to just 14 metres above sea-level at its confluence with the River Severn. {. Ordnance Survey: Worcester &amp; Droitwich Spa } The Teme has in recent times often bursts its banks. June and July 2007 saw serious floods in a number of areas, including Leintwardine, { YouTube - video of flooding } Tenbury Wells and Ludlow although the watercourse that flooded the latter location was a tributary, the River Corve. { Ludlow Advertiser } It is the 16th longest river in the United Kingdom. otters [ Nature ] The Teme is a clean river and after many years of decline the population of otters is recovering, { S.

However, unlawful canoeing does occur and there are many claims about the resulting conflict. As a result of its character, the demand for canoeing is seasonal, when there is enough water in the river, and is more in the upper reaches where the faster water can be found. However, this part of the river is also the most valuable for fishing, with riparian owners keen to protect their interests and prevent canoeing, on the grounds that the Teme is not suited to canoeing under any circumstances. While there is probably less conflict below Tenbury, there is also less interest in canoeing, and probably less opportunity, given the water levels. ] Information on canoeing on the Teme in the Ludlow area is available here { http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/midengland/teme.htm } and on the Tenbury Wells to Broadwas area here. { http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/midengland/temetenbury.htm } [ Leisure boating in the past ] Historical evidence of leisure boating includes: Old maps show a few boat houses along the river in Worcestershire. Ordnance Survey, six-inch maps (1st edition), various: accessible at www.old-maps.co.uk. Billings Directory 1855 mentions Boat House, evidently a farmhouse, at Eastham (five miles downstream of Tenbury Wells).

Boat House Farm still exists at Eastham Internal framing of barn at Boat House farm, Eastham, Worcestershire The boathouse at Newnham Bridge (three miles downstream of Tenbury Wells) was large enough, and substantial enough, to be converted into a house. Northern Area Development Control Committee Minutes of the Malvern Hills District Council, 6 October 2004. At Tenbury Wells in 1886, people were rescued during floods using a boat that had broken loose from its mooring so there must have been at least one boat on the river at that time. F. Wayland Joyce, Tenbury - Some Record of its History (1931) Down Along Temeside includes an account of travelling by boat from Ludford Mill to Orleton (a couple of miles upstream of Stanford Bridge) in the early 20th century. Richard Holding, Down Along Temeside (1963). Tenbury Wells and the Teme Valley includes a photograph taken at Little Hereford described as &apos;Boating on the Teme in 1905&apos;. The author mentions two gentlemen from Oxford who in 1894 travelled up the Teme from Worcester to Ludlow in 17.5 hours, and returned (downstream) in 9 hours. Howard Miller, Tenbury Wells and the Teme Valley (1996). [ Commercial navigation ] [ Navigation to Powick Mill ] There is no doubt that the final [ 1.5 mi km ] from Powick bridge and Mill to its confluence with the river Severn that the Teme is (or was) navigable. There was a coal wharf near Powick Bridge, belonging with the mill, whose owner had the right to use a towing path to the river Severn. In the 18th century, pig iron was brought up the river to Powick forge (as the mill then was). { H. Lloyd, The Quaker Lloyds in the Industrial Revolution (1975), 148-50. } In 1810 it was reported that &quot; The Teme is also navigable for barges from its junction with the Severn near Powick upwards to a small distance above Powick Bridge. The river having considerable declivity its navigation is soon interrupted by shoals and shallows &quot; { William Pitt, A General View of the Agriculture of the County of Worcester With Observations on the Means of Its Improvement (Board of Agriculture, Great Britain) }   [ Above Powick Mill ] { Powick Mill and the } { A449 road bridge } Except for its lowest reaches, there is no substantial evidence that the river was navigable by barges. Claims have been made that traffic on the Teme began in Roman times and &apos;continued in Norman times, when it is known the stone for the mill at Ashford Carbonel was brought from Caen in the 14th century, using water transport all the way&apos;. { Colin Green. Severn Traders, Black Dwarf Publications (1999), ISBN 0-9533028-2-2. p.33. } However no unequivocal documentary or archaeological evidence has been adduced in support of this. William Sandys who between 1636 and 1639 made the Avon ) navigable from Tewkesbury to Stratford-upon-Avon was at the same time also authorised to improve the Teme between Worcester and Ludlow. There is however no evidence that he did so, perhaps due to his having used up all his resources on the Avon. Having failed to recover the Avon after the Restoration, Sir William Sandys and his son undertook work on the Wye and Lugg. { I.

Hadfield, Canals of the West Midlands (1969), 58-9. } However, with no locks available, this vessel would have been unable to pass mill weirs. Pictures, allegedly of Ludlow or its castle with a river and boats (thought to date from c.1830), such as A painting allegedly of Dinham Bridge, Ludlow. are probably at least partly derived from the artist&apos;s imagination. This subject was debated at length in 2006 in the Journal of Railway and Canal Historical Society. { Pat Jones &apos;Navigation on the river Teme&apos; Journal of Railway and Canal Historical Society 35(4) (March 2006), 293-300. } { Peter King &apos;The River Teme and Other Midland Navigations&apos; Journal of Railway and Canal Historical Society 35(5) (July 2006), 348-55.
