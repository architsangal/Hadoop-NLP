The change in duration of secretion thus serves as a biological signal for the organisation of daylength-dependent ( photoperiodic ) seasonal functions such as reproduction, behaviour, coat growth and camouflage colouring in seasonal animals. In seasonal breeders that do not have long gestation periods and that mate during longer daylight hours, the melatonin signal controls the seasonal variation in their sexual physiology, and similar physiological effects can be induced by exogenous melatonin in animals including mynah birds [ 803–9 10.1071/ZO9840803 http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/ZO9840803.htm Effect of Melatonin on the Adrenl and Gonad of the Common Mynah Acridtheres tristis 1984 Chaturvedi CM Australian Journal of Zoology 32 6 ] and hamsters.

Melatonin is secreted into the blood by the pineal gland in the brain. Known as the &quot; hormone of darkness &quot;, it is secreted in darkness in both day-active ( diurnal ) and night-active ( nocturnal ) animals. It may also be produced by a variety of peripheral cells such as bone marrow cells, [ Maestroni GJ The immunotherapeutic potential of melatonin Expert Opin Investig Drugs 10 3 467–76 2001 March 11227046 10.1517/13543784.10.3.467 ] [ Conti A, Conconi S, Hertens E, Skwarlo-Sonta K, Markowska M, Maestroni JM Evidence for melatonin synthesis in mouse and human bone marrow cells J.

Usually, the melatonin concentration in these cells is much higher than that found in the blood, but it does not seem to be regulated by the photoperiod. [ In mammals ] Melatonin, produced in the pineal gland which is outside of the blood–brain barrier, acts as an endocrine hormone since it is released into the blood. [ Kaur C, Ling EA Antioxidants and neuroprotection in the adult and developing central nervous system Curr. Med. Chem. 15 29 3068–80 2008 19075654 10.2174/092986708786848640 ] Melatonin can suppress libido by inhibiting secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland, especially in mammals that have a breeding season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of long-day breeders is repressed by melatonin and the reproduction of short-day breeders is stimulated by melatonin. During the night, melatonin regulates leptin, lowering the levels; see leptin. Light/dark information reaches the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) via retinal photosensitive ganglion cell s, intrinsically photosensitive photoreceptor cell s, distinct from those involved in image forming (that is, these light-sensitive cells are a third type in the retina, in addition to rods and cones ). These cells represent approximately 2% of the retinal ganglion cells in humans and express the photopigment melanopsin.

Its onset each evening is called the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO). It is principally blue light, around 460 to 480   nm, that suppresses melatonin, [ Brainard GC, Hanifin JP, Greeson JM, Byrne B, Glickman G, Gerner E, Rollag MD Action spectrum for melatonin regulation in humans: evidence for a novel circadian photoreceptor J.

Until recent history, humans in temperate climates were exposed to few hours of (blue) daylight in the winter; their fires gave predominantly yellow light. Wearing glasses that block blue light in the hours before bedtime may avoid melatonin loss. Kayumov et al. showed that light containing only wavelengths greater than 530  nm does not suppress melatonin in bright-light conditions. [ Kayumov L, Casper RF, Hawa RJ, Perelman B, Chung SA, Sokalsky S, Shapiro CM Blocking low-wavelength light prevents nocturnal melatonin suppression with no adverse effect on performance during simulated shift work J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 90 5 2755–61 2005 May 15713707 10.1210/jc.2004-2062 ] Use of blue-blocking goggles the last hours before bedtime has also been advised for people who need to adjust to an earlier bedtime, as melatonin promotes sleepiness. [ March 2012 ] When used several hours before sleep according to the phase response curve for melatonin in humans, small amounts of melatonin shift the circadian clock earlier, thus promoting earlier sleep onset and morning awakening.

Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants, counterintuitively promoting free radical formation. Melatonin, on the other hand, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.

AFMK alone is detectable in unicellular organisms and metazoans. A single AFMK molecule can neutralize up to 10 ROS/RNS (reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species) since many of the products of the reaction/derivatives (including melatonin) are themselves antioxidants. This capacity to absorb free radicals extends at least to the quaternary metabolites of melatonin, a process referred to as &quot; the free radical scavenging cascade. &quot; This is not true of other, conventional antioxidants. In animal models, melatonin has been demonstrated to prevent the damage to DNA by some carcinogens, stopping the mechanism by which they cause cancer.

[ Autism ] Individuals with autism spectrum disorder s (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis.

[ Aging ] Research has supported the anti-aging properties of melatonin. Younger children hit their peak melatonin production at night, and some researchers believe that the level of melatonin peaks earlier as we get older. This may explain why older adults go to bed earlier, wake up earlier, and have more sleep problems than children do. { University of Maryland Medical Center. “Melatonin.” 2011. http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/melatonin-000315.htm } Some studies have shown that melatonin plays a crucial part in the aging process and that it may act as an anti-aging agent when taken by older mice. It has been reported in one study that administration of melatonin in elderly mice may reverse this change in expression of some 13 genes, thus making them similar to those of younger mice.

The hormone may be administered orally, as capsules, tablets or liquid, sublingually, or as transdermal patches. The use of melatonin derived from animal pineal tissue may carry the risk of contamination or the means of transmitting viral material. The synthetic form of this medication does not carry this risk.
