Accessed June 2011. } These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as available resources, climate, geography, history, cooking techniques and lifestyle. One style may favour the use of lots of garlic and shallot s over lots of chilli and spices, while another may favour preparing seafood over other meats and fowl. Jiangsu cuisine favours cooking techniques such as braising and stew ing, while Sichuan cuisine employs baking, just to name a few. Hairy crab is a highly sought after local delicacy in Shanghai, as it can be found in lakes within the region. Beijing Roast Duck (otherwise known as &apos;Peking Duck&apos;) is another popular dish well known outside of China. Based on the raw materials and ingredients used, the method of preparation and cultural differences, a variety of foods with different flavours and textures are prepared in different regions of the country. Many traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of preservation such as drying, salting, pickling and fermentation. { J. Li &amp; Y. Hsieh. Traditional Chinese Food Technology and Cuisine.

[ Drinks ] [ Tea ] { Longjing tea, also known as Dragon Well tea, is a variety of roasted green tea from } { Hangzhou, } { Zhejiang Province, China, where it is produced mostly by hand and has been renowned for its high quality, earning the } { China Famous Tea title. } [ Chinese tea ] As well as with dim sum, many Chinese drink their tea with snacks such as nuts, plums, dried fruit (in particular jujube ), small sweets, melon seeds, and waxberry.

Asiapac Books Pte Ltd. 2005.ISBN 9812293698. } Tea processing began after the Qin and Han Dynasties. Chinese tea is often classified into several different categories according to the species of plant from which it is sourced, the region in which it is grown, and the method of production used. Some of these are green tea, oolong tea, black tea, scented tea, white tea, and compressed tea. There are four major tea plantation regions in China. They are Jiangbei, Jiangnan, Huanan and the southwestern region. Well known types of green tea include Longjing, Huangshan, Mao Feng, Bilochun, Putuofeng Cha, and Liu&apos;an Guapian. { Zonglin Chang Xukui Li. Aspect of Chinese Culture. 2006.ISBN 7302126321, ISBN 978-7-302-12632-4. } China is the world’s largest exporter of green tea. One of the most ubiquitous accessories in modern China, after a wallet or purse and an umbrella, is a double-walled insulated glass thermos with tea leaves in the top behind a strainer. [ Liquor ] [ Chinese alcoholic beverages ] Yellow wine has a long history in China, where the unique beverage is produced from rice and ranges between 10–15% alcohol content. The most popular brands include Shaoxing Lao Jiu, Shaoxing Hua Diao and Te Jia Fan. Wheat, corn and rice are used to produce Chinese liquor which is clear and aromatic, containing approximately 60% alcohol. This also has a long history in China, with production believed to date back to the Song Dynasty. Some popular brands of liquor include Er guo tou, Du Kang, Mao Tai, Lu Zhou Te Qu and Wu Liang Ye. [ Herbal drinks ] [ Chinese herb tea ] Chinese herb tea, also known as medicinal herbal tea, is a kind of tea-soup made from purely Chinese medicinal herb s. [ June 2011 ] [ Milk ] Chinese in earlier dynasties evidently drank milk and ate dairy products, although not necessarily from cows, but perhaps koumiss (fermented mare&apos;s milk). After the Tang dynasty there emerged a line dividing Asia into two groups, those who depend on milk products (India, Tibet, Central Asians) and those who reject those foods. Chinese depend on soy, as more efficient way of supporting density, and to differentiate themselves from border nomads. Most Chinese until recently have avoided milk, partly because pasturage for milk producers in a monsoon rice ecology is not economic, partly because milk products became negatively associated with horse riding, milk drinking nomadic tribes. There may even be a biological bias. A certain number of people in any ethnic group are lactose intolerant. In addition, human beings, like other mammals, after they are weaned, stop producing lactase enzymes (needed to digest milk) unless they drink milk. Lactose intolerance is then partly cultural, partly biological. { Jack Goody, Cooking, Cuisine, and Class: A Study in Comparative Sociology (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 107; Chang, ed., Food in Chinese Culture: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives. } But this non-dairy tradition has undergone some change as a result of the Occidentalization of China. For example, it has been suggested that, in the early 20th century Shanghai, “Western food, and in particular identifiably nourishing items like milk, became a symbol of a neo-traditional Chinese notion of family.” { Mark Swislocki, Culinary Nostalgia: Regional Food Culture and the Urban Experience in Shanghai (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2009), p. 25. } [ Styles ] In most dishes in Chinese cuisine, food is prepared in bite-sized pieces, ready for direct picking up and eating. In traditional Chinese cultures, chopsticks are used at the table. Traditional Chinese cuisine is also based on opposites, whereby hot balances cold, pickled balances fresh and spicy balances mild. [ June 2011 ] [ Recent trends ] According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of undernourished people in the country has fallen from 386.6 million in 1969–1971 to 150.0 million in 2001–2003. [ http://www.fao.org/faostat/foodsecurity/Files/NumberUndernourishment.xls Undernourished persons by country Food security statistics FAO 2008-04-25 ] [ April 2012 ] Prior to the increased industrialization and modernization following the establishment of the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949 (and the late 1950s famine ), a typical Chinese peasant would have eaten meat or animal products (including fish and eggs) and most meals would have consisted of rice accompanied with green vegetables, with protein often coming from foods like peanut s and soy products. [ June 2011 ] Fats and sugar were luxuries not eaten on a regular basis by most of the population. With increasing wealth, Chinese diets have become richer over time, consuming more meats, fats, and sugar. [ Variations ] Where there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. This has resulted in a number of forms of fusion cuisine, often very popular in the country in question, and some of these, such as ramen (Japanese Chinese) have become popular internationally. These include: [ 3 ] American Chinese cuisine Canadian Chinese cuisine Caribbean Chinese cuisine Filipino Chinese cuisine Indian Chinese cuisine Japanese Chinese cuisine Korean Chinese cuisine Pakistani Chinese cuisine Singaporean Chinese cuisine Chifa (Peruvian Chinese cuisine) [ See also ] [ China Food ] [ 2 ] Chinese cooking techniques Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining List of Chinese dishes History of Chinese cuisine Chinese Cuisine Training Institute Chinese food therapy [ References ] [ 2 ] [ External links ] [ Home/Cooking/World_Cuisines/Asian/Chinese ] BBC TWO Chinese food made easy [ cuisine ] [ autocollapse ] [ October 2010 ] * Category:Historical foods ar:مطبخ صيني bg:Китайска кухня ca:Gastronomia de la Xina cs:Čínská kuchyně da:Kinesisk madlavning de:Chinesische Küche et:Hiina köök es:Gastronomía de China eo:Ĉina kuirarto eu:Txinatar gastronomia fa:آشپزی چینی fr:Cuisine chinoise ko:중화요리 hi:चीनी व्यंजन hr:Kineska kuhinja id:Masakan Cina it:Cucina cinese he:המטבח הסיני ku:Pêjgeha çînî lt:Kinų virtuvė hu:Kínai konyha mk:Кинеска кујна ms:Masakan China my:တရုတ်ဟင်းလျာ nl:Chinese keuken ja:中華料理 no:Det kinesiske kjøkken pl:Kuchnia chińska pt:Culinária da China ro:Bucătărie chinezească ru:Китайская кухня fi:Kiinalainen keittiö sv:Kinesiska köket ta:சீனச் சமையல் th:อาหารจีน tr:Çin mutfağı uk:Китайська кухня vi:Ẩm thực Trung Quốc zh:中国菜
