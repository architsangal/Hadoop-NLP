[ CMB Cosmic background radiation ] [ Early universe ] In cosmology, cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation (also CMBR, CBR, MBR, and relic radiation) is thermal radiation filling the observable universe almost uniformly. [ Penzias A.A. Wilson R.W. A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Mc/s Astrophysical Journal 142 419–421 1965 10.1086/148307 1965ApJ...142..419P ] With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all directions, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. The CMB&apos;s serendipitous discovery in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson [ Smoot Group The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation http://aether.lbl.gov/www/science/cmb.html 28 March 1996 Lawrence Berkeley Lab 2008-12-11 ] was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned them the 1978 Nobel Prize. Cosmic background radiation is well explained as radiation left over from an early stage in the development of the universe, and its discovery is considered a landmark test of the Big Bang model of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was smaller, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from its white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons could form neutral atoms. These atoms could no longer absorb the thermal radiation, and the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the recombination epoch, and the event shortly after of photons starting to travel freely through space rather than constantly scattering with electrons and protons in plasma is referred to as photon decoupling, with the set of points in space and time where photons began to travel freely being called the surface of last scattering. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck&apos;s relation ). This is the source for the alternate term relic radiation. Precise measurements of cosmic background radiation are critical to cosmology, since any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation. The CMBR has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.725 K, [ Fixsen D. J. The Temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background The Astrophysical Journal 707 2 916–920 December 2009 10.1088/0004-637X/707/2/916 2009ApJ...707..916F ] which peaks at the microwave range frequency of 160.2  GHz, corresponding to a 1.873  mm wavelength. This holds if measured per unit frequency, as in Planck&apos;s law. If measured instead per unit wavelength, using Wien&apos;s law, the peak is at 1.06  mm corresponding to a frequency of 283  GHz. The glow is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny remaining variations show a very specific pattern equal to that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot gas that has expanded to the current size of the universe. In particular, the spatial power spectrum (how much difference is observed versus how far apart the regions are on the sky) contains small anisotropies, or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded to the size of the observable universe we see today. This is still a very active field of study, with scientists seeking both better data (for example, the Planck spacecraft ) and better interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion. Although many different processes might produce the general form of a black body spectrum, no model other than the Big Bang has yet explained the fluctuations. As a result, most cosmologists consider the Big Bang model of the universe to be the best explanation for the CMBR.

H. 1998 The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins 186 Basic Books 020132840 ] the nascent universe underwent exponential growth that smoothed out nearly all inhomogeneities. The remaining inhomogeneities were caused by quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field that caused the inflation event. [ Cirigliano D. de Vega H.J. Sanchez N. G. 2005 Clarifying inflation models: The precise inflationary potential from effective field theory and the WMAP data Physical Review D 71 10 77–115 10.1103/PhysRevD.71.103518 astro-ph/0412634 2005PhRvD..71j3518C ] After 10 −6 seconds, the early universe was made up of a hot, interacting plasma of photon s, electrons, and baryon s. As the universe expanded, adiabatic cooling caused the plasma to lose energy until it became favorable for electrons to combine with protons, forming hydrogen atoms. This recombination event happened when the temperature was around 3000  K or when the universe was approximately 379,000  years old. [ Abbott B. 2007 Microwave (WMAP) All-Sky Survey http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/universe/duguide/exgg_wmap.php Hayden Planetarium 2008-01-13 ] At this point, the photons no longer interacted with the now electrically neutral atoms and began to travel freely through space, resulting in the decoupling of matter and radiation. [ Gawiser E. Silk J. 2000 The cosmic microwave background radiation Physics Reports 333–334 245 10.1016/S0370-1573(00)00025-9 astro-ph/0002044 2000PhR...333..245G ] The color temperature of the decoupled photons has continued to diminish ever since; now down to [ 2.72548 ± 0.00057 K ], their temperature will continue to drop as the universe expands. According to the Big Bang model, the radiation from the sky we measure today comes from a spherical surface called the surface of last scattering. This represents the set of locations in space at which the decoupling event is estimated to have occurred [ Smoot G.

Most of the radiation energy in the universe is in the cosmic microwave background, [ Hobson M.P. Efstathiou G.

The CMB spectrum has become the most precisely measured black body spectrum in nature.

However, they did not refer to such a background, but only to &apos;radiation from cosmic matter&apos;. Also, this work was unrelated to cosmology and is only mentioned because it suggests that by 1950, detection of the background radiation might have been technically possible, and also because of Dicke&apos;s later role in the discovery &quot;.

Although they do not specifically mention microwave background radiation, it may be inferred. Kragh, H.

This high estimate was due to a mis-estimate of the Hubble constant by Alfred Behr, which could not be replicated and was later abandoned for the earlier estimate. Although there were several previous estimates of the temperature of space, these suffered from two flaws. First, they were measurements of the &apos;&apos;effective&apos;&apos; temperature of space and did not suggest that space was filled with a thermal Planck spectrum. Next, they depend on our being at a special spot at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic.

The mainstream astronomical community, however, was not intrigued at the time by cosmology. Alpher and Herman&apos;s prediction was rediscovered by Yakov Zel&apos;dovich in the early 1960s, and independently predicted by Robert Dicke at the same time.

[ Narlikar J. V. Wickramasinghe N.

This was largely because new measurements at a range of frequencies showed that the spectrum was a thermal, black body spectrum, a result that the steady state model was unable to reproduce.

Inspired by the COBE results, a series of ground and balloon-based experiments measured cosmic microwave background anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the scale of the first acoustic peak, which COBE did not have sufficient resolution to resolve. This peak corresponds to large scale density variations in the early universe that are created by gravitational instabilities, resulting in acoustical oscillations in the plasma.

Measurements of the CMB have made the inflationary Big Bang theory the standard model of the earliest eras of the universe. [ Scott D. 2005 The Standard Cosmological Model 2005astro.ph.10731S astro-ph/0510731 astro-ph ] The discovery of the CMB in the mid-1960s curtailed interest in alternatives such as the steady state theory. [ Durham, Frank; Purrington, Robert D. Frame of the universe: a history of physical cosmology Columbia University Press 1983 0-231-05393-2 193–209 ] The Big Bang theory predicts that the initial conditions for the universe are originally random in nature, and inhomogeneities follow a roughly Gaussian probability distribution, which, when graphed in cross-section, form bell-shaped curves. By analyzing this distribution at different frequencies, a spectral density or power spectrum is generated. The power spectrum of these fluctuations has been calculated, and agrees with the observations. The resulting standard model of the Big Bang uses a Gaussian random field with a nearly scale invariant or Harrison-Zel&apos;dovich spectrum to represent the primeval inhomogeneities. [ Torres S. 1993 Topological Analysis of COBE-DMR CMB Maps astro-ph astro-ph/9311067 ] [ Thompson J. M. T. 2005 Advances in Astronomy 24–25 Imperial College Press 1-86094-577-5 ] Certain observables, for example the overall amplitude of the fluctuations, are more or less free parameters of the cosmic inflation model. [ Turner M. S. 2002 The New Cosmology: Mid-term Report Card for Inflation 10.1007/s00023-003-0926-x Annales Henri Poincaré 4 S333–S346 astro-ph/0212281 2003AnHP....4..333T ] Therefore, meaningful statements about the inhomogeneities in the universe need to be statistical in nature. This leads to cosmic variance in which the uncertainties in the variance of fluctuations at the largest scale observed are difficult to accurately compare to theory. [ Temperature ] The CMB gives a snapshot of the universe when, according to standard cosmology, the temperature dropped enough to allow electron s and proton s to form hydrogen atoms, thus making the universe transparent to radiation. When it originated some 380,000 years after the Big Bang—this time is generally known as the &quot; time of last scattering &quot; or the period of recombination or decoupling —the temperature of the universe was about 3000 K. This corresponds to an energy of about 0.25 eV, which is much less than the 13.6 eV ionization energy of hydrogen. [ Brandenberger Robert H. 1995 Formation of Structure in the Universe 1995astro.ph..8159B 8159 astro-ph/9508159 astro-ph ] Since decoupling, the temperature of the background radiation has dropped by a factor of roughly 1,100 due to the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the CMB photons are redshift ed, making the radiation&apos;s temperature inversely proportional to a parameter called the universe&apos;s scale length. The temperature T r of the CMB as a function of redshift, z, can be shown to be proportional to the temperature of the CMB as observed in the present day (2.725 K or 0.235 meV): [ Noterdaeme, P.; Petitjean, P.; Srianand, R.; Ledoux, C.; López, S.

Also shown is a theoretical model (solid line). } The anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background is divided into two types: primary anisotropy, due to effects which occur at the last scattering surface and before; and secondary anisotropy, due to effects such as interactions of the background radiation with hot gas or gravitational potentials, which occur between the last scattering surface and the observer. The structure of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and diffusion damping (also called collisionless damping or Silk damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a competition in the photon – baryon plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons—moving at speeds much slower than light—makes them tend to collapse to form dense haloes. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude. The peaks contain interesting physical signatures. The angular scale of the first peak determines the curvature of the universe (but not the topology of the universe). The next peak—ratio of the odd peaks to the even peaks—determines the reduced baryon density. [ http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/baryons.html Baryons and Inertia Wayne Hu ] The third peak can be used to get information about the dark matter density. [ http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/driving.html Radiation Driving Force Wayne Hu ] The locations of the peaks also give important information about the nature of the primordial density perturbations. There are two fundamental brands of density perturbations—called adiabatic and isocurvature. A general density perturbation is a mixture of both, and different theories that purport to explain the primordial density perturbation spectrum predict different mixtures. Adiabatic density perturbations the fractional overdensity in each matter component ( baryon s, photon s...) is the same. That is, if there is 1% more energy in baryons than average in one spot, then with a pure adiabatic density perturbations there is also 1% more energy in photons, and 1% more energy in neutrinos, than average. Cosmic inflation predicts that the primordial perturbations are adiabatic. Isocurvature density perturbations the sum of the fractional overdensities is zero. That is, a perturbation where at some spot there is 1% more energy in baryons than average, 1% more energy in photons than average, and 2% less energy in neutrinos than average, would be a pure isocurvature perturbation. Cosmic string s would produce mostly isocurvature primordial perturbations. The CMB spectrum is able to distinguish these two because these two brands of perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (l-values of the peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1:3:5:..., while adiabatic density perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1:2:3:... [ Hu W. White M. 1996 Acoustic Signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background Astrophysical Journal 471 30–51 10.1086/177951 1996ApJ...471...30H astro-ph/9602019 ] Observations are consistent with the primordial density perturbations being entirely adiabatic, providing key support for inflation, and ruling out many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings. Collisionless damping is caused by two effects, when the treatment of the primordial plasma as fluid begins to break down: the increasing mean free path of the photons as the primordial plasma becomes increasingly rarefied in an expanding universe the finite depth of the last scattering surface (LSS), which causes the mean free path to increase rapidly during decoupling, even while some Compton scattering is still occurring. These effects contribute about equally to the suppression of anisotropies on small scales, and give rise to the characteristic exponential damping tail seen in the very small angular scale anisotropies. The depth of the LSS refers to the fact that the decoupling of the photons and baryons does not happen instantaneously, but instead requires an appreciable fraction of the age of the Universe up to that era. One method to quantify exactly how long this process took uses the photon visibility function (PVF). This function is defined so that, denoting the PVF by P(t), the probability that a CMB photon last scattered between time t and t+dt is given by P(t)dt. The maximum of the PVF (the time where it is most likely that a given CMB photon last scattered) is known quite precisely. The first-year WMAP results put the time at which P(t) is maximum as [ 372 14 kyr ]. [ WMAP Collaboration 2003 First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Determination of Cosmological Parameters Astrophysical Journal (Supplement Series) 148 Verde 1 175–194 L. 10.1086/377226 Peiris H. V. Komatsu E. Nolta M. R. Bennett C. L. Halpern M. Hinshaw G. Jarosik N. astro-ph/0302209 2003ApJS..148..175S ] This is often taken as the &quot; time &quot; at which the CMB formed. However, to figure out how long it took the photons and baryons to decouple, we need a measure of the width of the PVF. The WMAP team finds that the PVF is greater than half of its maximum value (the &quot; full width at half maximum &quot;, or FWHM) over an interval of [ 115 5 kyr ]. By this measure, decoupling took place over roughly 115,000 years, and when it was complete, the universe was roughly 487,000 years old. [ Late time anisotropy ] Since the CMB came into existence, it has apparently been modified by several subsequent physical processes, which are collectively referred to as late-time anisotropy, or secondary anisotropy. When the CMB photons became free to travel unimpeded, ordinary matter in the universe was mostly in the form of neutral hydrogen and helium atoms. However, observations of galaxies today seem to indicate that most of the volume of the intergalactic medium (IGM) consists of ionized material (since there are few absorption lines due to hydrogen atoms). This implies a period of reionization during which some of the material of the universe was broken into hydrogen ions. The CMB photons scatter off free charges such as electrons that are not bound in atoms. In an ionized universe, such charged particles have been liberated from neutral atoms by ionizing (ultraviolet) radiation. Today these free charges are at sufficiently low density in most of the volume of the Universe that they do not measurably affect the CMB. However, if the IGM was ionized at very early times when the universe was still denser, then there are two main effects on the CMB: Small scale anisotropies are erased. (Just as when looking at an object through fog, details of the object appear fuzzy.) The physics of how photons scatter off from free electrons ( Thomson scattering ) induces polarization anisotropies on large angular scales. This broad angle polarization is correlated with the broad angle temperature perturbation. Both of these effects have been observed by the WMAP spacecraft, providing evidence that the universe was ionized at very early times, at a redshift more than 17. The detailed provenance of this early ionizing radiation is still a matter of scientific debate. It may have included starlight from the very first population of stars ( population III stars), supernovae when these first stars reached the end of their lives, or the ionizing radiation produced by the accretion disks of massive black holes. The time following the emission of the cosmic microwave background—and before the observation of the first stars—is semi-humorously referred to by cosmologists as the dark age, and is a period which is under intense study by astronomers (See 21 centimeter radiation ). Two other effects which occurred between reionization and our observations of the cosmic microwave background, and which appear to cause anisotropies, include the Sunyaev–Zel&apos;dovich effect, where a cloud of high-energy electrons scatters the radiation, transferring some of its energy to the CMB photons, and the Sachs–Wolfe effect, which causes photon s from the Cosmic Microwave Background to be gravitationally redshifted or blueshifted due to changing gravitational fields. { multipole moment ). The polarization is much more poorly measured than the temperature anisotropy. } [ Polarization ] [ Polarization in astronomy ] The cosmic microwave background is polarized at the level of a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to electrostatics, in which the electric field (E-field) has a vanishing curl and the magnetic field (B-field) has a vanishing divergence. The E-modes arise naturally from Thomson scattering in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes, which have not been measured and are thought to have an amplitude of at most a 0.1 µK, are not produced from the plasma physics alone. They are a signal from cosmic inflation and are determined by the density of primordial gravitational wave s. Detecting the B-modes will be extremely difficult, particularly given that the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the weak gravitational lensing signal mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal. [ Lewis A. Challinor A. 2006 Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB Physics Reports 429 1–65 10.1016/j.physrep.2006.03.002 astro-ph/0601594 2006PhR...429....1L ] [ Microwave background observations ] [ Cosmic microwave background experiments ] Subsequent to the discovery of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave background experiments have been conducted to measure and characterize the signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the NASA Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) satellite that orbited in 1989–1996 and which detected and quantified the large scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution. These measurements were able to rule out cosmic strings as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested cosmic inflation was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the BOOMERanG experiment reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree. Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the Universe is flat. A number of ground-based interferometer s provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the Very Small Array, Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI), and the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum. In June 2001, NASA launched a second CMB space mission, WMAP, to make much more precise measurements of the great scale anisotropies over the full sky. WMAP used symmetric, rapid-multi-modulated scanning, rapid switching radiometers to minimize non-sky signal noise. The first results from this mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed measurements of the angular power spectrum to below degree scales, tightly constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from cosmic inflation as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA&apos;s data bank for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the great angular-scale fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as broad in the sky as the moon), it did not have the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed by former ground-based interferometer s. A third space mission, the ESA (European Space Agency) Planck Surveyor, launched in May, 2009 and is currently performing an even more detailed investigation. Planck employs both HEMT radiometers as well as bolometer technology and will measure the CMB on smaller scales than WMAP. Its detectors got a trial run at the Antarctic Viper telescope as ACBAR ( Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver ) experiment—which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date—and at the Archeops balloon telescope. Additional ground-based instruments such as the South Pole Telescope in Antarctica and the proposed Clover Project, Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the QUIET telescope in Chile will provide additional data not available from satellite observations, possibly including the B-mode polarization. [ Data reduction and analysis ] Raw CMBR data coming down from the space vehicle (i.e., WMAP) contain foreground effects that completely obscure the fine-scale structure of the Cosmic Microwave background. The fine-scale structure is superimposed on the raw CMBR data but is too small to be seen at the scale of the raw data. The most prominent of the foreground effects is the dipole anisotropy caused by the Sun&apos;s motion relative to the CMBR background. The dipole anisotropy and others due to Earth&apos;s annual motion relative to the Sun and numerous microwave sources in the galactic plane and elsewhere must be subtracted out to reveal the extremely tiny variations characterizing the fine-scale structure of the CMBR background. The detail analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular power spectrum, and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a map is in principle a simple Fourier transform, decomposing the map of the sky into spherical harmonics, in practice it is hard to take the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such as free-free, synchrotron, and dust that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed lest they distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum. Constraints on many cosmological parameters can be obtained from their effects on the power spectrum, and results are often calculated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. [ CMBR dipole anisotropy ] From the CMB data it is seen that our local group of galaxies (the galactic cluster that includes the Solar System&apos;s Milky Way Galaxy) appears to be moving at 627±22  km/s relative to the reference frame of the CMB (also called the CMB rest frame, or the frame of reference in which there is no motion through the CMB) in the direction of galactic longitude l = 276±3°, b = 30±3°.

Even in the COBE map, it was observed that the quadrupole (l=2 spherical harmonic) has a low amplitude compared to the predictions of the big bang. Some observers have pointed out that the anisotropies in the WMAP data did not appear to be consistent with the big bang picture. In particular, the quadrupole and octupole (l=3) modes appear to have an unexplained alignment with each other and with the ecliptic plane, [ de Oliveira-Costa A. et al. 2004 The significance of the largest scale CMB fluctuations in WMAP Physical Review D 69 063516 10.1103/PhysRevD.69.063516 astro-ph/0307282 2004PhRvD..69f3516D 6 ] [ Schwarz D.

A number of groups have suggested that this could be the signature of new physics at the greatest observable scales; other groups suspect systematic errors in the data.

The analyses were performed on two maps that have had the foregrounds removed as best as is possible: the &quot; internal linear combination &quot; map of the WMAP collaboration and a similar map prepared by Max Tegmark and others.
