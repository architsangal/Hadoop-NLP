[ History of the Jews in Spain History of the Jews in Portugal ] [ the period of Spanish cultural flourishing in the 17th century Spanish Golden Age ] The golden age of Jewish culture in Spain coincided with the Middle Ages in Europe, a period of Muslim rule throughout much of the Iberian Peninsula. During that time, Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed. The nature and length of this &quot; Golden Age &quot; has been a subject of debate. Some scholars give the start of the Golden Age as either 711–718 (after the Muslim conquest of Iberia ) or 912 (the rule of Abd-ar-Rahman III ) and the end of the Golden Age variously as 1031 (when the Caliphate of Cordoba ended), 1066 (the date of the Granada massacre ), 1090 (when the Almoravides invaded), or the mid-12th century (when the Almohades invaded). [ The Nature of the Golden Age ] { cantor reading the } { Passover story in } { Al Andalus, from the 14th century } { Haggadah of } { Barcelona. } The treatment of non-Muslims in the Caliphate has been a subject of considerable debate among scholars and commentators, especially those interested in drawing parallels to the coexistence of Muslims and non-Muslims in the modern world. It has been argued that Jews (and other religious minorities) were treated significantly better in Muslim-controlled Iberia than in Christian western Europe, living in a unique &quot; golden age &quot; of tolerance, respect and harmony. Though Al-Andalus was a key center of Jewish life during the early Middle Ages, producing important scholars and one of the most stable and wealthy Jewish communities, there is no clear scholarly consensus over whether the relationship between Jews and Muslims was truly a paragon of interfaith relations, or whether it was simply similar to the treatment Jews received elsewhere at the same time. María Rosa Menocal, a specialist in Iberian literature at Yale University, has argued that &quot; Tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society &quot;. { The Ornament of the World by María Rosa Menocal, Accessed, 12 June 2006. } Menocal&apos;s 2003 book, The Ornament of the World, argues that the Jewish dhimmi s living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to al-Andalus, where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trade were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytisation. Bernard Lewis takes issue with this view, calling it ahistorical and exaggerated. He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality nor even pretended that it did, arguing that it would have been both a &quot; theological as well as a logical absurdity. &quot; { Lewis, Bernard W (1984). The Jews of Islam } However, also Lewis states: [ Generally, the Jewish people were allowed to practice their religion and live according to the laws and scriptures of their community. Furthermore, the restrictions to which they were subject were social and symbolic rather than tangible and practical in character. That is to say, these regulations served to define the relationship between the two communities, and not to oppress the Jewish population. ] Mark Cohen, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, in his Under Crescent and Cross, calls the idealized interfaith utopia a &quot; myth &quot; that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as Heinrich Graetz in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews. [ Cohen Mark R. Under Crescent and Cross Princeton University Press 1995 October 0-691-01082-X ] This myth was met with the &quot; counter-myth &quot; of the &quot; neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history &quot; by Bat Yeor and others, which also &quot; cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality &quot;. [ The Jewish Quarterly Review 1997 88 1/2 76–78 Review of Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages by Mark R. Cohen Daniel J. Lasker ] [ Birth of the Golden Age ] After 681, the Christian Visigoths of Hispania persecuted the Jews severely; therefore, the Jews welcomed the Muslim Arab and mainly Berber conquerors in the 8th century. The conquered cities of Córdoba, Málaga, Granada, Seville, and Toledo were briefly placed under the control of the Jewish inhabitants, who had been armed by the Moorish invaders. The victors removed the Christian Visigoths&apos; oppressive restrictions and granted the Jews full religious liberty, requiring them only to pay the tribute of one golden dinar per capita ( Jizya ). A period of tolerance thus dawned for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula, whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest. Especially after 912, during the reign of Abd-ar-Rahman III and his son, Al-Hakam II, the Jews prospered, devoting themselves to the service of the Caliphate of Cordoba, to the study of the sciences, and to commerce and industry, especially to trading in silk and slaves, in this way promoting the prosperity of the country. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In Toledo, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages, as well as translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to botany, geography, medicine, mathematics, poetry and philosophy. { Sephardim by Rebecca Weiner. } &apos;Abd al-Rahman&apos;s court physician and minister was Hasdai ben Isaac ibn Shaprut, the patron of Menahem ben Saruq, Dunash ben Labrat, and other Jewish scholars and poets. Jewish thought during this period flourished under famous figures such as Samuel Ha-Nagid, Moses ibn Ezra, Solomon ibn Gabirol Judah Halevi and Moses Maimonides. During &apos;Abd al-Rahman&apos;s term of power, the scholar Moses ben Enoch was appointed rabbi of Córdoba, and as a consequence al-Andalus became the center of Talmud ic study, and Córdoba the meeting-place of Jewish savants. This was a time of partial Jewish autonomy. As &quot; dhimmi s &quot;, or &quot; protected non-Muslims &quot;, Jews in the Islam ic world paid the jizya, which was administered separately from the zakat paid by Muslims. The jizya has been viewed variously as a poll tax, as payment for non-conscription in the military, or as a tribute. Jews had their own legal system and social services. Monotheist religions of the people of the book were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith, such as bells and processions, were discouraged. { Fred J. Hill et al., A History of the Islamic World 2003 ISBN 0-7818-1015-9, p.73 } Comparing the treatment of Jews in the medieval Islamic world and medieval Christian Europe, the Jews were far more integrated in the political and economic life of Islamic society, [ Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages Mark R.

The first major persecution was the 1066 Granada massacre, which occurred on December 30, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada, crucified Jew ish vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred most of the Jewish population of the city. &quot; More than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day. &quot; { Granada by Richard Gottheil, } { Meyer Kayserling, } { Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906 ed. } This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule. { Maimonides, one of the greatest Jewish scholars of Al Andalus, born in } { Córdoba. } { Arabic language in } { Hebrew letters } Beginning in 1090 the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the Almoravids, a puritan Muslim sect from Morocco. Even under the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under Ali III, than under his father Yusuf ibn Tashfin ). Among those who held the title of &quot; vizier &quot; or &quot; nasi &quot; in Almoravid times were the poet and physician Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu&apos;allam, Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial, Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar, and Solomon ibn Farusal. The Almoravids, were ousted from the peninsula in 1148; however, the peninsula was again invaded, by the even more puritanical Almohades. During the reign of these Berber dynasties, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the city of Toledo, which had been reconquered in 1085 by Christian forces. The major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forcibly expelled en masse due to the edict of expulsion by Christian Spain in 1492 and a similar decree by Christian Portugal in 1497.
