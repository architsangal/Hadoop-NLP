Most of them are dissimilar morphologically and phonetic ally. Even within each family, most are mutually unintelligible. Zhongguo Yuwen includes the many different Han Chinese language varieties (commonly called Chinese) as well as minority languages such as Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur and Zhuang. China has 292 living language s and 1 extinct language ( Jurchen ) according to Ethnologue. { Languages of China – from Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. } Putonghua or Standard Mandarin is the official national spoken language for the mainland. Several other autonomous regions have additional official languages. Language laws of China do not apply to either Hong Kong or Macau and hence have different official languages to the mainland. For example, Tibetan has official status within the Tibet Autonomous Region, Mongolian has official status within Inner Mongolia and Uyghur has official status within Xinjiang. There are large economic, social, and practical incentives to be functional in Putonghua, a standardised form of the Mandarin group of dialects which is based in Beijing and spoken with varying degrees of dialectical influences across the northern and southwestern China. Putonghua serves as a lingua franca within the Mandarin-speaking region, and to a lesser extent across the various other language groups in mainland China. [ Spoken languages ] The spoken languages of nationalities that are a part of the People&apos;s Republic of China belong to at least seven families: Turkic languages : Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Salars, etc. Mongolic languages : Mongols, Dongxiang, and related groups Tungusic languages : Manchus (formerly), Hezhe, etc. Korean languages : Koreans { The } { Austroasiatic family : 4 (the } { De&apos;ang, } { Blang, } { Gin (Vietnamese), and } { Wa ) } { The } { Tai–Kadai family : several languages spoken by the } { Zhuang, the } { Buyei, the } { Dai people, the } { Dong people, and the } { Hlai (Li people). } { The } { Indo-European family : 2 (the } { Russians and } { Tajiks ).

These are: Mongol Tibetan Arabic (for Uyghur) Latin (for Zhuang) Ten nationalities who never had a written system have, under the PRC &apos;s encouragement, developed phonetic alphabet s. According to a government white paper published in early 2005, &quot; by the end of 2003, 22 ethnic minorities in China used 28 written languages. &quot; [ Language policy ] Chinese language policy in mainland China is heavily influenced by Soviet nationalities policy and officially encourages the development of standard spoken and written languages for each of the nationalities of China. However, in this schema, Han Chinese are considered a single nationality, and official policy of the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC) treats the different varieties of the Chinese spoken language differently from the different national languages despite the fact that they are more different from each other than, for example, the Romance languages of Europe.While official policies in mainland China encourage the development and use of different orthographies for the national languages and their use in educational and academic settings, realistically speaking it would seem that, as elsewhere in the world, the outlook forminority languages perceived as inferior is grim. { The prospects for the long-term survival of Non-Han minority languages in the south of China } The Tibetan Government-in-Exile argue that social pressures and political efforts result in a policy of sinicization and feels that Beijing should promote the Tibetan language more. [ Study of foreign languages ] It is also considered increasingly prestigious and useful to have some ability in English, which is a required subject for persons attending university. During the 1950s and 1960s, Russian had some social status among elites in mainland China as the international language of socialism. Japanese is the second most-studied foreign language in China. However, languages other than English are now considered as &quot; minor languages &quot; (小语种 xiǎo yǔzhǒng) and are only really studied at university level. English is taught in the public schools starting in the third year of primary school. The Economist, issue April 12, 2006, reported that up to one fifth of the population is learning English. Gordon Brown, the former British Prime Minister, estimated that the total English-speaking population in China will outnumber the native speakers in the rest of the world in two decades.

Arabic language education was promoted by the Kuomintang in Islamic schools when it ruled mainland China.
