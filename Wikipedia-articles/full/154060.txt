Schirach was the head of the Hitler-Jugend (HJ, Hitler Youth) and Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter ( &quot; Reich Governor &quot; ) of Vienna. [ Early life ] Schirach was born in Berlin, the youngest of four children of theatre director Rittmeister Carl Baily Norris von Schirach (1873–1948) and his American wife Emma Middleton Lynah Tillou (1872–1944). Through his mother, Schirach descended from two signatories of the United States Declaration of Independence. { Arthur Middleton and } { Thomas Heyward Jr. } English was in fact the first language which he learned at home and he was not able to speak German until the age of five. He had two sisters, Viktoria and Rosalind von Schirach, and a brother, Karl Benedict von Schirach, who committed suicide in 1919 at the age of 19. On 31 March 1932 von Schirach married 19-year-old Henriette Hoffmann, the daughter of Heinrich Hoffmann, Adolf Hitler &apos;s personal photographer and close friend. Von Schirach&apos;s family was vehemently opposed to the marriage to Henriette, but Hitler insisted. { The Mind of Adolf Hitler, } { Walter Charles Langer, New York 1972, pp. 99–100 } Von Schirach, says Gregor Strasser, was &quot; a young effeminate aristocrat &quot; upon whom Hitler bestowed Henriette and the HJ position. Through this relationship, von Schirach became part of Hitler&apos;s inner circle. The young couple were appreciated guests at Hitler&apos;s &quot; Berghof &quot;. Henriette von Schirach gave birth to four children: Angelika Benedikta von Schirach (born 1933), Klaus von Schirach (born 1935), Robert von Schirach (1938) and Richard von Schirach (born 1942). The lawyer and bestselling German crime writer Ferdinand von Schirach is his grandson.

During his tenure 65,000 Jews were deported from Vienna to Poland, and in a speech on 15 September 1942 he mentioned their deportation as a &quot; contribution to European culture. &quot; Later during the war von Schirach pleaded for a moderate treatment of the eastern European peoples and criticized the conditions in which Jews were being deported. He fell into disfavour in 1943, but remained at his post. { Baldur von Schirach } Schirach was notoriously anxious about air raids. He had the cellars of the Hofburg Palace in the Vienna city centre refurbished and adapted as a bomb shelter, and the lower level of the extensive subterranean Vienna air defence coordination centre in the forests to the West of Vienna held personal facilities for him as well. The Viennese promptly dubbed this C &amp; C centre Schirach-Bunker. { Nuremberg Trials (in second row, second from right) } [ Trial and conviction ] Schirach surrendered in 1945 and was one of the officials put on trial at Nuremberg. At the trial Schirach was one of only two men to denounce Hitler (the other was Albert Speer ). He said that he did not know about the extermination camps. He also provided evidence that he had protested to Martin Bormann about the inhumane treatment of the Jews. Also, it was revealed by Schirach at Nuremberg that the roots of his antisemitism could be found in the readings of Henry Ford &apos;s The International Jew. He was found guilty, on 1 October 1946, of crimes against humanity for his deportation of the Viennese Jews. He was sentenced and served 20 years as a prisoner in Spandau Prison. On 20 July 1949 his wife Henriette von Schirach (3 February 1913 – 27 January 1992) divorced him while he was in prison. According to Lothar Machtan&apos;s The Hidden Hitler, page 229, von Schirach was bisexual. In the book, The Mind of Adolf Hitler, Baldur von Schirach is reputed to be a homosexual. { The Mind of Adolf Hitler, } { Walter Charles Langer, New York 1972, p. 99 } He was released on 30 September 1966, and retired quietly to southern Germany. He published his memoirs, Ich glaubte an Hitler ( &quot; I believed in Hitler &quot; ) and died on 8 August 1974 in Kröv.
