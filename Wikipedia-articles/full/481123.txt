This was the first album recorded following the departure of keyboardist Andy Creeggan, who had considered leaving before the recording of their previous album, Maybe You Should Drive. [ Barenaked Ladies: Spontaneity And Surprise Jennie Punter http://www.davidrickard.net/bnl.org/html/impact.html Impact June 1996 2010-03-01 ] BOAPS was recorded as a four-piece. Kevin Hearn is not credited on the album, but joined the group for the 1995 tour that preceded the album&apos;s release in time to be thanked in the liner notes for &quot; injecting new spirit. &quot; Steven Page and Ed Robertson returned to writing together, as they did upon the band&apos;s formation, but had abandoned following the release of Gordon, Tracks recorded for this album but left off the finished record are: &quot; Trust Me &quot; (earlier recorded for Maybe You Should Drive but left off the album—included on the Shoe Box EP) and &quot; Back &quot; (included on the &quot; Brian Wilson 2000 &quot; single). As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song completely naked: for BOAPS, it was &quot; Back &quot;. The front cover features a boy in a newspaper hat pulling at his cheeks, in reference to the childhood prank alluded to by the album&apos;s title. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a childhood picture of BNL bassist Jim Creeggan, but simply a child actor hired for the photos. The album is also an enhanced CD. The data track contains audio samples from the band&apos;s previous two CDs, a short montage of press photos, several of the band&apos;s music videos, a short trivia quiz, and a pair of &quot; behind the scenes &quot; videos from the band. Similar content was included and expanded upon on the Shoe Box E.P.; however, the format of the enhanced CD used in the creation of that CD renders the data track inaccessible on modern operating systems. Although a moderate #18 hit in Canada, the album only managed #111 in the US. Born On A Pirate Ship was awarded gold status in the U.S. in 2000, after the band became more popular there.
