His birth name was Liholiho and full name was Kalaninui kua Liholiho i ke kapu Iolani. It was lengthened to Kalani Kalei aimoku o Kaiwikapu o La amea i Kauikawekiu Ahilapalapa Keali i Kauinamoku o Kahekili Kalaninui i Mamao Iolani i Ka Liholiho when he took the throne. [ Early life ] He was born circa 1797 in Hilo, on the island of Hawai i, the eldest son of Kamehameha I and his highest-ranking consort Queen Keōpuolani. He was groomed to be heir to the throne from age five. It was originally planned that he would be born at the Kūkaniloko birth site on the island of O ahu but the Queen&apos;s sickness prevented travel.

Kamehameha I, then, put him in the care of Queen Ka ahumanu (another wife of Kamehameha I), who was appointed as Liholiho&apos;s official guardian.

He was named Iolani Liholiho. His first name meant &quot; royal hawk &quot; while his second and most referred name Liholiho means something that is glowing, shining, the shining issue, reflecting the glory of the heavens. A later interpretation said his name mean &quot; dog of dogs &quot; which arose from a mistake made by Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue in calling him &quot; Lio-Lio &quot; which later writers took as īlio īlio would mean &quot; dog of dogs &quot;. Each version disgard the vital &quot; h &quot; sound in his name, but the latter interpretation was widely accepted due the negative opinion of the king as a pleasure-seeker.

However, Queen Ka ahumanu had no intention to give him actual leadership. When Liholiho sailed toward the shores of Kailua Kona (the capital at the time), she greeted him wearing Kamehameha&apos;s royal red cape, and she announced to the people on shore and to the surprised Liholiho, &quot; We two shall rule the land. &quot; Liholiho, young and inexperienced, had no other choice. Ka ahumanu became the first Kuhina Nui ( co-regent ) of Hawaii. He was forced to take on merely a ceremonial role; administrative power was to be vested in Ka ahumanu. He took the title &quot; King Kamehameha II &quot;, but preferred to be called Iolani, which means &quot; heavenly (or royal) hawk &quot;.

What followed was the disbanding of the social class of priest and the destruction of temples and images. Kamehameha I had bequeathed his war god Kū-ka ili-moku and his temples to his cousin Kekuaokalani. Kekuaokalani demanded that Liholiho withdraw his edicts against the Hawaiian priesthood, permit rebuilding of the temples, and dismiss both Kalanimōkū and Ka ahumanu. Kamehameha II refused. At the battle of Kuamo o on the island of Hawai i, the king&apos;s better-armed forces, led by Kalanimōkū, defeated the last defenders of the Hawaiian gods, temples, and priesthoods of the ancient organized religion. The first Christian missionaries arrived only a few months later in the Hawaiian Islands. He never officially converted to Christianity because he refused to give up four of his five wives and his love of alcohol. He (like his father) married several relatives of high rank, but he was the last Hawaiian king to practice polygamy. His favorite wife was his half-sister Kamāmalu. Kīnaʻu (Kamāmalu&apos;s full-blood sister) was his second wife who would later remarry and become Kuhina Nui. Princess Kalani Pauahi was his niece by his half-brother Pauli Kaōleiokū. She later remarried and gave birth to Princess Ruth Ke elikōlani. Kekāuluohi was half-sister of Kamāmalu and Kīna u through their mother Kaheiheimālie who was another of his father&apos;s wives. Princess Kekau ōnohi was Liholiho&apos;s niece and granddaughter of Kamehameha I, and would later become royal governor of the islands of Maui and Kaua i. The royal yacht &apos;&apos;Ha aheo o Hawai i&apos;&apos; He was known to be impulsive. For example, on November 16, 1820 he bought a Royal Yacht known as Cleopatra&apos;s Barge for 8000 picul s of sandalwood (over a million pounds), estimated to be worth about US$80,000 at the time. It had been sold a few years before for $15,400 by the Crowninshield family of Salem, Massachusetts. Kamehameha II was quite proud of his ship; in the words of Charles Bullard, the agent for the shipowner: &quot; If you want to know how Religion stands at the Islands I can tell you — All sects are tolerated but the King worships the Barge. &quot; He tried to gain favor with missionaries by offering free passage on the opulent ship, and regularly entertained foreign visitors with their choice of alcoholic beverages. On April 18, 1822 it required a major overhaul because most of the wood had rotted. He paid to have wood shipped in from the Pacific Northwest for repairs, and then renamed his ship Ha aheo o Hawai i ( &quot; Pride of Hawaii &quot; ). After re-launching May 10, 1823 it was wrecked less than a year later.

A few nobles such as Chiefess Kapi olani and Governor Boki were aboard, with about 30 men. He ordered the ship to instead cross a dangerous channel all the way to the island of Kaua i, despite having no compass, charts, nor provisions on board. They somehow made it to Kaua i. When they arrived, the local Chief Kaumuali i did not fire his cannons on the unarmed ship but welcomed the young king. The Royal Yacht was sent for, and the royal party entertained themselves for over a month. Then one night after he invited Kaumuali i on board, Kamehameha II abruptly ordered the yacht to sail in the night. Upon returning to Honolulu, he had Kaumuali i &quot; marry &quot; Ka ahumanu and kept him under house arrest in exile until his death.

On April 16, 1822 English missionary William Ellis arrived with a schooner Prince Regent of six guns to add to his growing collection of ships. It was a gift from the King of Great Britain, and Kamehameha II wrote to thank him, requesting closer diplomatic ties.

After his mother Keōpūolani&apos;s death on September 16, 1823, he made up his mind to go. In November 1823 Kamehameha II and Queen Kamāmalu commissioned the British whaling ship L&apos;Aigle (French for &quot; the Eagle &quot; ) under Captain Valentine Starbuck to carry them to London. Going along were High Chief Boki and wife High Chiefess Kuini Liliha, and other chiefs and retainers including Manuia, Naihekukui, James Young Kānehoa, Kekūanāo a, Kauluhaimalama, Na aiweuweu, and Naukane who had already been to America (where he picked up the name John Coxe) and then England.

Somehow Rives talked his way on board instead as translator. In February 1824 they arrived at Rio de Janeiro in newly-independent Brazil where they met Emperor Pedro I. The Emperor gave Kamehameha II a ceremonial sword, and in return was presented with a native Hawaiian feather cloak made from rare tropical bird feathers which is now in the National Museum of Brazil.

Foreign Office Secretary George Canning appointed Frederick Gerald Byng (1784–1871) to supervise their visit. Byng was a Gentleman Usher, fifth son of John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington and friend of Beau Brummell, known more for his gaudy fashions than diplomacy. [ Biography: Hon. Frederick Gerald Byng (1784-1871) A web of English history Marhorie Bloy http://historyhome.co.uk/people/poodle.htm 2010-02-26 ] Their arrival was met by the local press with a mixture of curiosity and derision. They were not sure what to call the king, spelling his &quot; Liholiho &quot; name various ways such as &quot; Rheo Rhio &quot;. Some made puns on the fact that Byng&apos;s nickname was &quot; Poodle &quot; and in Hawaiian īlio īlio would mean &quot; dog of dogs &quot; and that the British name of the kingdom was &quot; Sandwich Islands &quot;. Byng made sure they would have appropriate attire for all their public appearances. On May 28 a reception with 200 guests including several Dukes was held in their honor. [ 10524/75 ] { 30–32 } They toured London, visiting Westminster Abbey, but he refused to enter because he did not want to desecrate their burial place: &quot; Liholiho, King Kamehameha II, refused to step in there, because he wasn’t blood-connected. These were the kings, and he felt he had no right, to walk around their caskets. He didn’t even step foot in there, he didn’t want to desecrate their burial places with his presence or his feet stepping in that area. &quot; { Dunmore, John (1992); Who&apos;s Who in Pacific Navigation, Australia:Melbourne University Press, ISBN 0-522-84488-X, p 238 } They attended opera and ballet at Royal Opera House in Covent Garden on May 31, and the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane on June 4 in the Royal Box.

Several members of the court had portraits painted by the Hayter family. Queen consort Kamāmalu at London King George IV finally scheduled a meeting for June 21, but it had to be delayed as Kamāmalu became ill. The Hawaiian court had caught measles, to which they had no immunity. They probably contracted the disease on their June 5 visit to the Royal Military Asylum (now the Duke of York&apos;s Royal Military School).

The grief-stricken Kamehameha II died six days later on July 14, 1824. Vast crowds lined up when he was laid in state at the Caledonian Hotel on July 17.On July 18 the bodies were stored in the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields church where they awaited transportation back home. Boki took over lead of the delegation and finally did have an audience with King George IV. Kānehoa (James Young), with superior English language skills conferred by his English father John Young, was entrusted with the official letters of introduction and served as new translator. Rives and Starbuck were accused of misspending the royal treasury and departed. In September 1824 the bodies returned to Hawaii on the enormous Royal Navy frigate [ Blonde 1819 6 ] under the command of Captain George Anson Byron. [ Andrew Bloxam 1925 Diary of Andrew Bloxam: naturalist of the Blondeon her trip from England to the Hawaiian islands, 1824-25 Volume 10 of Bernice P. Bishop Museum special publication ] The Blonde arrived back in Honolulu on May 6, 1825. Kalanimōkū had been notified of the deaths in a letter from Rives, so Hawaiian royalty gathered at his house where the bodies were moved for the funeral. The marines and crew from the ship made a formal procession, the ship&apos;s chaplain read an Anglican prayer, and an American missionary was allowed to make a prayer in the Hawaiian language. [ 266 ] They were buried on the grounds of the Iolani Palace in a coral house meant to be the Hawaiian version of the tombs Liholiho had seen in London. They were eventually moved to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii known as Mauna Ala. Kamehameha II was succeeded by his younger brother Kauikeaouli, who became King Kamehameha III.
