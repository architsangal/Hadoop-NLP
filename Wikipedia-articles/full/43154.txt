Her father, who was, in her words, &quot; wonderful at math but a terrible farmer, &quot; earned only $300 a year from sharecropping and dairy farming. Her mother supplemented the family income by working as a maid. { World Authors 1995-2000, 2003. Biography Reference Bank database. Retrieved 2009-04-10. } She worked 11 hours a day for USD $ 17 per week to help pay for Alice to attend college.

A white plantation owner said to her that black people had “no need for education.” Minnie Lou Walker said, &quot; You might have some black children somewhere, but they don’t live in this house. Don’t you ever come around here again talking about how my children don’t need to learn how to read and write.” Her mother enrolled Alice in first grade at the age of four. [ White, Evelyn C. 2004 Alice Walker: A Life W.W. Norton &amp; Company New York, New York 14–15 ] Growing up with an oral tradition, listening to stories from her grandfather (the model for the character of Mr. in The Color Purple), Walker began writing, very privately, when she was eight years old. &quot; With my family, I had to hide things, &quot; she said. &quot; And I had to keep a lot in my mind. &quot; [ Gussow, Mel Once Again, Alice Walker Is Ready to Embrace Her Freedom to Change The New York Times December 26, 2000 section E, p.1 ] In 1952, Walker was accidentally wounded in the right eye by a shot from a BB gun fired by one of her brothers. { http://enloehs.wcpss.net/resources/kingsberry/propaganda.pdf } Because the family had no car, the Walkers could not take their daughter to a hospital for immediate treatment. By the time they reached a doctor a week later, she had become permanently blind in that eye. When a layer of scar tissue formed over her wounded eye, Alice became self-conscious and painfully shy. Stared at and sometimes taunted, she felt like an outcast and turned for solace to reading and to writing poetry. When she was 14, the scar tissue was removed. She later became valedictorian and was voted most-popular girl, as well as queen of her senior class, but she realized that her traumatic injury had some value: it allowed her to begin &quot; really to see people and things, really to notice relationships and to learn to be patient enough to care about how they turned out &quot;. After high school, Walker went to Spelman College in Atlanta on a full scholarship in 1961 and later transferred to Sarah Lawrence College near New York City, graduating in 1965. Walker became interested in the U.S. civil rights movement in part due to the influence of activist Howard Zinn, who was one of her professors at Spelman College. Continuing the activism that she participated in during her college years, Walker returned to the South where she became involved with voter registration drives, campaigns for welfare rights, and children&apos;s programs in Mississippi. { &apos;&apos;On Finding Your Bliss&apos;&apos;.

Walker credits King for her decision to return to the American South as an activist for the Civil Rights Movement. She marched with hundreds of thousands in August in the 1963 March on Washington. As a young adult, she volunteered to register black voters in Georgia and Mississippi. { Democracy Now - Walker Interview transcript and audio file on &quot; Inner Light in A time of darkness &quot;.

Walker and 5,000 activists associated with the organizations Code Pink and Women for Peace, marched from Malcolm X Park in Washington D.C. to the White House. The activists encircled the White House. In an interview with Democracy Now, Walker said, &quot; I was with other women who believe that the women and children of Iraq are just as dear as the women and children in our families, and that, in fact, we are one family. And so it would have felt to me that we were going over to actually bomb ourselves. &quot; Walker wrote about the experience in her essay, &quot; We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For. &quot; { Press release &quot; Notable Women Arrested Protesting Against the War with Iraq &quot;.

Their purpose was to deliver aid, to meet with NGO s and residents, and to persuade Israel and Egypt to open their borders into Gaza. She planned to visit Gaza again in December 2009 to participate in the Gaza Freedom March. { Gaza Freedom March.

They were married on March 17, 1967 in New York City. Later that year the couple relocated to Jackson, Mississippi, becoming &quot; the first legally married inter-racial couple in Mississippi &quot;. { Times article &apos;&apos;The day feminist icon Alice Walker resigned as my mother&apos;&apos; } [ Inner Light in a Time of Darkness: A Conversation with Author and Poet Alice Walker Democracy Now!

The couple had a daughter Rebecca in 1969. Walker described her in 2008 as &quot; a living, breathing, mixed-race embodiment of the new America that they were trying to forge. &quot; Walker and her husband divorced amicably in 1976. Walker and her daughter became estranged. Rebecca felt herself to be more of &quot; a political symbol... than a cherished daughter &quot;. She published a memoir entitled Black White and Jewish, expressing the complexities of her parents&apos; relationship and her childhood. Rebecca recalls her teenage years when her mother would retreat to her far-off writing studio while “I was left with money to buy my own meals and lived on a diet of fast food.” Since the birth of Rebecca’s son Tenzin, her mother has not spoken to her because she dared to “question her ideology.” Rebecca has learned that she was cut out of her mother’s will in favor of a distant cousin. { &apos;&apos;[[Daily Mail ] article by Rebecca Walker: How my mother&apos;s fanatical views tore us apart&apos;&apos;] } { [[Daily Mail ] article by Rebecca Walker: How my mother&apos;s fanatical views tore us apart] } { The Times article &apos;&apos;The day feminist icon Alice Walker resigned as my mother &apos;&apos;.

[ Writing career ] { Miami Book Fair International of 1989 } Walker&apos;s first book of poetry was written while she was a senior at Sarah Lawrence. She took a brief sabbatical from writing while working in Mississippi in the civil rights movement. Walker resumed her writing career when she joined Ms. magazine as an editor before moving to northern California in the late 1970s. Her 1975 article &quot; In Search of Zora Neale Hurston &quot;, published in Ms Magazine, helped revive interest in the work of Zora Neale Hurston, who inspired Walker&apos;s writing and subject matter. In 1973, Walker and fellow Hurston scholar Charlotte D. Hunt discovered Hurston&apos;s unmarked grave in Ft. Pierce, Florida. The women collaborated to buy a modest headstone for the gravesite. { Extract from Alice Walker, &apos;&apos;Anything We Love Can Be Saved: A Writer&apos;s Activism&apos;&apos;, The Women&apos;s Press Ltd, 1997. } In addition to her collected short stories and poetry, Walker&apos;s first novel, The Third Life of Grange Copeland, was published in 1970. In 1976, Walker&apos;s second novel, Meridian, was published. The novel dealt with activist workers in the South during the civil rights movement, and closely paralleled some of Walker&apos;s own experiences. In 1982, Walker published what has become her best-known work, the novel The Color Purple. About a young troubled black woman fighting her way through not only racist white culture but also patriarchal black culture, it was a resounding commercial success. The book became a bestseller and was subsequently adapted into a critically acclaimed 1985 movie as well as a 2005 Broadway musical. Walker has written several other novels, including The Temple of My Familiar and Possessing the Secret of Joy (which featured several characters and descendants of characters from The Color Purple). She has published a number of collections of short stories, poetry, and other published work. She expresses the struggles of black people, particularly women, and their lives in a racist, sexist, and violent society. Her writings also focus on the role of women of color in culture and history. Walker is a respected figure in the liberal political community for her support of unconventional and unpopular views as a matter of principle. Her short stories include the 1973 Everyday Use, in which she discusses feminism, racism and the issues raised by young black people who leave home and lose respect for their parents&apos; culture. { Walker, Alice. &quot; Everyday Use &quot;. Perrine&apos;s Literature: Structure, Sound, and Sense, Comp. Thomas R. Arp. New York: Harcourt Brace College, 1994, pp. 90-97. } In 2007, Walker gave her papers, 122 boxes of manuscripts and archive material, to Emory University&apos;s Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library. { Justice, Elaine. &quot; Alice Walker Places Her Archive at Emory &quot; Emory University News, December 18, 2007 } In addition to drafts of novels such as The Color Purple, unpublished poems and manuscripts, and correspondence with editors, the collection includes extensive correspondence with family members, friends and colleagues, an early treatment of the film script for The Color Purple, syllabi from courses she taught, and fan mail. The collection also contains a scrapbook of poetry compiled when Walker was 15, entitled &quot; Poems of a Childhood Poetess &quot;.
