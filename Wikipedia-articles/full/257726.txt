The village, home to about 6,587 people, is bounded by Pittsford to the west and south and Perinton to the north and east. The southern boundary is delimited by New York State Route 31F, which runs parallel to but never enters East Rochester. The village line in the remaining three directions are less distinct. [ History ] [ Beginnings ] The Village of East Rochester was originally known as the Village of Despatch when the community was incorporated in 1897. Despatch was laid out as a planned community designed around the New York Central Railroad mainline that ran through the center of the village. Much of the original land which became the village came from Fairport businessman Walter Parce. This land was used to develop housing for employees of the earliest employers: The Merchants Despatch Corporation and the Aeolian Piano Corporation. The original buildings of the Aeolian Piano Corporation are still in use today as a shopping center and office complex called Piano Works Mall. To better showcase the village&apos;s proximity to the city of Rochester, the village was incorporated as the Village of East Rochester in 1906. The boundaries of the village were divided between the towns of Perinton, Pittsford, and Penfield. [ Coterminous status ] In 1982, the residents of the village voted to become a coterminous town and village. [ Disasters ] Two notable disasters have occurred in East Rochester, both involving derailment s on the double-track mainline running through town. The first occurred on 29 October 1969 when a 30-car Penn Central freight train carrying produce derailed onto West Maple Avenue (which, along with East Maple Avenue, runs parallel to the tracks between NY 153 and South Lincoln Road), crushing numerous automobiles and toppling telephone poles. Remarkably, no one was injured.

The wreckage extended west from South Lincoln along East Maple Avenue to Madison Street as derailed cars crushed a number of vehicles parked alongside the tracks and dumped intermodal containers into the front yards of residents on Maple. Overall, eight wells and 15 to 20 containers came off the rails. As in 1969, no one was injured in the accident. The presence of mangled intermodal cars in the southbound lanes of Lincoln Road, as well as one teetering on the edge of the bridge, forced the closure of the road. It reopened January 18 following two days of cleanup. The 200 block of East Maple Avenue, however, remained closed for repair work for several days afterward.

[ Culture ] [ October 2008 ] [ section October 2008 ] East Rochester has been considered by the public as Rochester&apos;s &quot; Little Italy, &quot; as over a half of the town&apos;s residents have Italian ancestry, and Italian can even be heard in offices and homes. It has also been home to some of the finest Italian restaurants in the Rochester area including The Northside Inn, Perlo&apos;s, The Grapevine Restaurant and for many years, Giuseppe&apos;s. Surace&apos;s Pizza, located along Commercial Street, adds to this reputation and is a lunch time institution in the community. Due to the success of its high school sports teams, (despite the small size of the village and school in relation to surrounding towns) East Rochester has been affectionately referred to as &quot; The Home of Champions. &quot; Its high school men&apos;s basketball, football and wrestling teams each won numerous sectional championships from the 1960s until the early 1990s. The majority of these football and wrestling squads found their success under the direction of local legend Don Quinn. In recent years, the school&apos;s women&apos;s sports teams have carried on this tradition as field hockey and lacrosse have enjoyed dominance on both the regional and state-wide level. Interestingly enough, it is Quinn&apos;s daughter who coaches these teams. Also one of the most successful teams in East Rochester is the varsity cheerleading squad. With 6 national champion titles and 9 section five champion titles, as well as various titles from local competitions, this team has become a &quot; legend &quot;. The 2007–2008 East Rochester Boys Basketball team won a sectional title, the team&apos;s first since 1963. Baseball has always been an integral part of village life. In 1966, the East Rochester Little League&apos;s Senior Division Baseball All-Star team became world champions, winning the World Series, which was held in Des Moines, Iowa. { http://www.littleleague.org/series/history/divisions/slbbhistory.htm } Moreover, the East Rochester Boys Varsity Baseball team won their first Section V baseball title in 1989 and went on to win five more under coach Ron Rucker in the early 1990s. [ September 2010 ] The Bombers were the first High School in the Rochester area to play its outdoor sports upon a FieldTurf artificial playing surface, with one being installed in 2001. Until the late 1980s, the Bomber football team played an annual game with their rivals from Fairport; the Red Raiders. The winner of this game took home the coveted Little Brown Jug and was played until the enrollment of Fairport High grew much too large to make such a contest feasible. The rivalry, however, is still somewhat understood between the two neighbors as it is often referred to in other capacities outside of athletics.
