Geburtstag. Mohr Siebeck. ISBN 3-16-146675-6. p. 484. } Bnei Brak was founded as an agricultural village by Yitzchok Gerstenkorn and a group of Polish chasidim. Due to a lack of land many of the founders turned to other occupations and the village began to develop an urban character. Arye Mordechai Rabinowicz, formerly rabbi of Kurów in Poland, was the first rabbi. He was succeeded by Rabbi Yosef Kalisz, a scion of the Vurker dynasty. The town was set up as a religious settlement from the outset, as is evident from this description of the pioneers: &quot; Their souls were revived by the fact that they merited what their predecessors had not. What particularly revived their weary souls in the mornings and toward evening, when they would gather in the beis medrash situated in a special shack which was built immediately upon the arrival of the very first settlers, for tefilla betzibbur (communal prayer) three times a day, for the Daf Yomi shiur, and a Gemara shiur and an additional one in Mishnayos and the Shulchan Oruch. &quot; [ http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5759/yisro/features.htm Bnei Brak at 75: City of Torah and Chassidus Dei&apos;ah VeDibur 2008-10-25 ] bnei brak was once mentioned in a mishnah Bnei Brak achieved city status in 1950.

In the early 1950s, the Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, founded a large neighborhood in Bnei Brak which continues to serve as a dynastic center under his son, Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua Hager. Beginning in the 1960s, the rebbes of the Ruzhin dynasty ( Sadigura, Husiatyn, Bohush), who had formerly lived in Tel Aviv, moved to Bnei Brak.

As the town grew they found themselves in the middle of a residential area; both left the area. Osem&apos;s main factory is now located on Jabotinsky road in Petah Tikva, just next to Bnei Brak. A business district is being built in Bnei Brak as of 2011, which will include 15 office towers. [ Culture and lifestyle ] Haredim in Bnei Brak Until the 1970s, the Bnei Brak municipality was headed by Religious Zionist mayors. [ February 2007 ] After Mayor Gottlieb of the National Religious Party was defeated, Haredi parties grew in status and influence; since then they have governed the city. As the Haredi population grew, the demand for public religious observance increased and more residents requested the closure of their neighbourhoods to vehicular traffic on Shabbat. In a short period of time most of Bnei Brak&apos;s secular and Religious Zionist residents migrated elsewhere, and the city has become almost homogeneously Haredi. The city has one secular neighborhood, Pardes Katz.

Several organizations help the ill, special needs population, and the poor. There are also available abundant articles to be borrowed free of charge, from extra baby beds, electric drills, paint rollers, to bridal dresses. The Bnei Brak municipality set up an alternative water supply, for use on Shabbat and Jewish holiday s. This supply, which does not require intervention by Jews on days of rest, avoids the problems associated with Jews working on the day of rest at the national water company Mekorot. Most of the streets are closed on Shabbat and Jewish holidays.
