Margarine in a tub Margarine ( [ icon ˈ m ɑr dʒ ər ɨ n ], [ ˈ m ɑr ɡ ər ɨ n ], [ ˈ m ɑr dʒ r ɨ n ], or [ ˈ m ɑr dʒ ər iː n ] ) is a generic term for vegetable fat spreads, typically composed of vegetable oils. While butter is derived from animal fats (typically milk fats), margarine is derived from plant oils and fats ( oils ) and skimmed milk. In some locales it is colloquially referred to as oleo, short for oleomargarine. Margarine can be used both for spreading or for baking and cooking. It is also commonly used as an ingredient in other food products, such as pastries and cookies, for its wide range of functionalities. [ Etymology ] The word &quot; margarine &quot; comes from the Ancient Greek μαργαρίτης (“pearl”). [ History ] Margarine originated with the discovery by Michel Eugène Chevreul in 1813 of &apos;&apos;&apos;margaric acid&apos;&apos;&apos; (itself named after the pearly deposits of the fatty acid from Greek [ grc μαργαρίτης ] or μάργαρον (margaritēs / márgaron), meaning pearl-oyster or pearl, [ Food industries manual Baker Christopher G.J, Ranken H.D, Kill R.C.

In 1853, the German structural chemist, Wilhelm Heinrich Heintz, analyzed margaric acid as simply a combination of stearic acid and of the previously unknown palmitic acid. { C.G.

Mège-Mouriès patented the concept in 1869 and expanded his initial manufacturing operation from France but had little commercial success. In 1871, he sold the patent to the Dutch company Jurgens, now part of Unilever.

Bans on adding colour became commonplace in the U.S., Australasia and Canada and, in some cases, those bans endured for almost 100 years. It did not become legal to sell coloured margarine in Australia, for example, until the 1960s. The rivalry between the dairy industry and the oleomargarine industry persists even today.

O&apos;Connor Anahad 16 October 2007 New York Times New York Times Company 10 October 2009 ] [ Canada ] In Canada, margarine was banned from 1886 until 1948 though this ban was temporarily lifted from 1917 until 1923 due to dairy shortages. Nevertheless, bootleg margarine was produced in the neighbouring British colony of Newfoundland from whale, seal and fish oil by the Newfoundland Butter Company (which, in fact, produced only margarine) and was smuggled to Canada where it was widely sold for half the price of butter. The Supreme Court of Canada lifted the margarine ban in 1948 in the Margarine Reference. In 1950, as a result of a court ruling giving provinces the right to regulate the product, rules were implemented in much of Canada regarding margarine&apos;s colour, requiring it to be bright yellow or orange in some provinces or colourless in others. By the 1980s, most provinces had lifted the restriction, however, in Ontario it was not legal to sell butter-coloured margarine until 1995.

By the mid-1880s, the U.S. federal government had introduced a tax of two cents per pound, and manufacturers needed an expensive license to make or sell the product. Individual states began to require the clear labeling of margarine. The color bans, drafted by the butter lobby, began in the dairy states of New York and New Jersey. In several states, legislatures enacted laws to require margarine manufacturers to add pink colorings to make the product look unpalatable, [ Visser Margaret Margaret Visser Much Depends on Dinner Harper Perennial Canada 1986 Toronto 107 0-00-639104-4 ] but the Supreme Court struck down New Hampshire&apos;s law and overruled these measures in Collins v. New Hampshire, 171 U.S. 30 (1898). Some localities required restaurants using margarine to post signs reading &quot; Artificial Butter Used Here &quot;. By the start of the 20th century, eight out of ten Americans could not buy yellow margarine, and those that could had to pay a hefty tax on it. Bootleg colored margarine became common, and manufacturers began to supply food-coloring capsules so that the consumer could knead the yellow color into margarine before serving it. Nevertheless, the regulations and taxes had a significant effect: the 1902 restrictions on margarine color, for example, cut annual U.S. consumption from [ 120000000 to 48000000 lb t -3 ]. With the coming of World War I, margarine consumption increased enormously, even in countries away from the front like the U.S. In the countries closest to the fighting, dairy products became almost unobtainable and were strictly rationed. The United Kingdom, for example, depended on imported butter from Australia and New Zealand, and the risk of submarine attack meant little arrived. The long-running rent-seeking battle between the margarine and dairy lobbies continued: In the U.S., the Great Depression brought a renewed wave of pro-dairy legislation; the Second World War, a swing back to margarine. Post-war, the margarine lobby gained power and, little by little, the main margarine restrictions were lifted, the most recent states to do so being Minnesota in 1963 and Wisconsin in 1967. { Dupre R: &apos;&apos;Margarine Regulation in North America Since 1886&apos;, Journal of Economic History, Vol 59, No 2, June 1999, Pages 353-371. } Lois Dowdle Cobb (1889–1987) of Atlanta, Georgia, wife of the agricultural publisher Cully Cobb, led the move in the United States to lift the restrictions on margarine.

Rajah Kanes 1 May 2005 Al Business website The Gale Group, Inc. 10 November 2009 ] The definition for margarine originally came from the legal definition for butter  — both contained a minimum of 16% water and a minimum fat content of 80%. This was adopted by all major producers and became the industry standard. The principal raw material in the original formulation of margarine was beef fat. Shortages in supply combined with advances in the hydrogenation of plant materials soon led to the addition of vegetable oils, and between 1900 and 1920 oleomargarine was produced from a combination of animal fats and hardened and unhardened vegetable oils. [ http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?contentType%3DArticle%26amp%3BFilename%3D%2Fpublished%2Femeraldfulltextarticle%2Fpdf%2F0070200504.pdf The marketing of margarine Clark Paul 6 may 1983 Paper presented to a seminar on Marketing and Advertising in the 20th Century at Central London Polytechnic Emeral Backfiles 54 2009-11-10 ] The depression of the 1930s, followed by the rationing of World War II, led to a reduction in supply of animal fat; and, by 1945, &quot; original &quot; margarine almost completely disappeared from the market. In the U.S., problems with supply, coupled with changes in legislation, caused manufacturers to switch almost completely to vegetable oils and fats (oleomargarine) by 1950 and the industry was ready for an era of product development. During WWII rationing, only two types of margarine were available in the UK, a premium brand and a cheaper budget brand. With the end of rationing in 1955 the market was opened to the forces of supply and demand and brand marketing became prevalent. The competition between the major producers was given further impetus with the beginning of commercial television advertising in 1955; and, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, competing companies vied with each other to produce the margarine that tasted most like butter. In the mid-1960s, the introduction of two lower-fat blends of butter oil and vegetable oils in Scandinavia, called Lätt &amp; Lagom and Bregott, clouded the issue of what should be called &quot; margarine &quot; and began the debate that led to the introduction of the term &quot; spread &quot;. In 1978, an 80% fat product called Krona, made by churning a blend of dairy cream and vegetable oils, was introduced in Europe; and, in 1982, a blend of cream and vegetable oils called Clover was introduced in the UK by the Milk Marketing Board. The vegetable oil and cream spread I Can&apos;t Believe It&apos;s Not Butter! was introduced in the United States in 1986 and in the United Kingdom and Canada in 1991. { http://www.unilever.co.uk/ourbrands/foods/icantbelieveitsnotbutter.asp } { http://www.unilever.ca/ourbrands/foods/ICBINB.asp } In recent decades, margarine spreads have gone through many developments in efforts to improve their healthfulness. Most brands have phased out the use of hydrogenated oils, and are now also trans fat free. As well, many brands have launched refrigerator-stable margarine spreads that contain only 1/3 of the fat and calorie content of traditional spreads. Other varieties of spreads include those with added Omega-3 fatty acids for heart and brain health, those with low or no salt, those with added plant sterols for reducing blood cholesterol, and some made from olive oil or certified vegan oils. { http://www.becel.ca/en_ca/about_becel/default.aspx } { http://www.becel.ca/en_ca/products } [ Manufacture ] The basic method of making margarine today consists, as it did in Mège-Mouriés day, of emulsifying a blend of purified vegetable oils with skimmed milk, chilling the mixture to solidify it and working it to improve the texture. Vegetable and animal fats are similar compounds with different melting point s. Those fats that are liquid at room temperature are generally known as oil s. The melting points are determined by the presence of alkenic double bonds on fatty (carboxylic) acids; the higher the number of double bonds, the lower the melting point. Alternatively, solid fats can be manufactured from oils by converting animal or vegetable oils by passing hydrogen through the oil in the presence of a nickel catalyst, under controlled conditions. { Babaeu Z, Nikoopour H, Safafar H. A comparison of commercial nickel catalysts effects on hydrogenation of soybean oil. World Applied Sciences Journal 2(6) 621-626, 2007. url: http://www.idosi.org/wasj/wasj2(6)/10.pdf } The addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds (alkenic double C=C bonds) results in saturated C-C bonds, effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus &quot; hardening &quot; it. This is due to the increase in van der Waals&apos; forces between the saturated molecules compared with the unsaturated molecules. However, as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet, the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture. Margarines manufactured in this way are said to contain hydrogenated fat. [ http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/alkenes/hydrogenation.html The Hydrogenation of Alkenes:Margarine Manufacture Claek Jim Chemguide:Helping you to understand Chemistry 9 November 2009 ] This method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as palladium. If hydrogenation is incomplete (partial hardening), the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the &quot; trans &quot; form. If these particular bonds aren&apos;t hydrogenated during the process, they will still be present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats, the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Some tropical oils, such as palm oil and coconut oil, are naturally semi solid and do not require hydrogenation.

Margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 to 90% fat. Depending on its final fat content and its purpose (spreading, cooking or baking), the level of water and the vegetable oils used will slightly vary. The oil is pressed from seeds and refined. It is then blended with solid fat. If no solid fats are added to the vegetable oils, the latter undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them. The resulting blend is mixed with water, citric acid, carotenoids, vitamins and milk powder. Emulsifiers such as lecithin help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil, and salt and preservatives are also commonly added. This oil and water emulsion is then heated, blended, and cooled. The softer tub margarines are made with less hydrogenated, more liquid, oils than block margarines. [ http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/margarine.html Margarine Anon Butter through the ages webexhibits.org 10 November 2009 ] Three main types of margarine are common: Soft vegetable fat spreads, high in mono- or polyunsaturated fats, which are made from safflower, sunflower, soybean, cottonseed, rapeseed, or olive oil. Margarines in bottle to cook or top dishes Hard, generally uncolored margarine for cooking or baking. ( Shortening ) [ Blending with butter ] Many popular table spreads sold today are blends of margarine and butter or other milk products. Blending, which is used to improve the taste of margarine, was long illegal in countries such as the United States and Australia. Under European Union directives, a margarine product cannot be called &quot; butter &quot;, even if most of it consists of natural butter. In some European countries butter-based table spreads and margarine products are marketed as &quot; butter mixtures &quot;. Butter mixtures now make up a significant portion of the table spread market. The brand &quot; I Can&apos;t Believe It&apos;s Not Butter &quot; spawned a variety of similarly named spreads that can now be found on supermarket shelves all over the world, with names like &quot; Utterly Butterly &quot;, &quot; You&apos;d Butter Believe it &quot;, &quot; Beautifully Butterfully &quot;, and &quot; Butterlicious &quot;. These butter mixtures avoid the restrictions on labelling, with marketing techniques that imply a strong similarity to real butter. Such marketable names present the product to consumers differently from the required product labels that call margarine &quot; partially hydrogenated vegetable oil &quot;. [ Market acceptance ] Margarine, particularly polyunsaturated margarine, has become a major part of the Western diet and overtook butter in popularity in the mid-20th century. In the United States, for example, in 1930 the average person ate over [ 18 lb ] of butter a year and just over [ 2 lb ] of margarine. By the end of the 20th century, an average American ate around [ 5 lb on ] of butter and nearly [ 8 lb on ] of margarine. [ http://www.webexhibits.org/butter/consumption-butter-fat.html Eating less butter and more fat Anon Butter through the ages webexhibits.org 10 November 2009 ] Margarine has particular market to those who observe the Jewish dietary laws of Kashrut. Kashrut forbids the mixing of meat and dairy products, and hence there are strictly Kosher non-dairy margarines available. These are often used by the Kosher consumer to adapt recipes that use meat and butter, or in baked goods that will be served with meat meals. The 2008 Passover margarine shortage in America caused much consternation within the Kosher-observant community. Margarine that doesn&apos;t contain dairy products can also provide a vegan substitute for butter. [ Nutrition ] Discussions concerning the nutritional value of margarines and spreads revolve around two aspects  — the total amount of fat, and the types of fat ( saturated fat, trans fat ). Usually, a comparison between margarine and butter is included in this context as well. [ Amount of fat ] [ http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fat/NU00262 Dietary fats: Know which types to choose Mayo Clinic January 31, 2007 2008-05-18 ] &lt; /ref &gt; The roles of butter and traditional margarine (80% fat) are similar with respect to their energy content, but low-fat margarines and spreads are also widely available. [ Saturated fat ] [ Saturated fats ] The saturated fatty acids have been linked to elevated blood cholesterol levels, which in turn has been linked to cardiovascular diseases.

Vegetable fats can contain anything between 7% and 86% saturated fatty acids. Liquid oils ( canola oil, sunflower oil ) tend to be on the low end, while tropical oils ( coconut oil, palm kernel oil ) and fully hardened ( hydrogenated ) oils are at the high end of the scale.

Some widely grown vegetable oils, such as rapeseed (and its variant canola ), sunflower, safflower, and olive oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fats. During the manufacture of margarine, some of the unsaturated fats may be converted into hydrogenated fats or trans fats in order to give them a higher melting point so that they are solid at room temperatures. [ Omega-3 fatty acids ] Omega-3 fatty acids Omega-3 fatty acids are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have been found especially good for health. This is one of the two Essential fatty acid s, so called because humans cannot manufacture it and must get it from food. Omega-3 fatty acids are mostly obtained from oily fish caught in high-latitude waters. They are comparatively uncommon in vegetable sources, including margarine. However, one type of Omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) can be found in some vegetable oils. Flax oil contains 30-50% of ALA, and is becoming a popular dietary supplement to rival fish oils; both are often added to premium margarines. An ancient oil plant, camelina sativa, has recently gained popularity because of its high Omega-3 content (30-45%), and it has been added to some margarines. Hemp oil contains about 20% ALA. Small amounts of ALA are found in vegetable oils such as soybean oil (7%), rapeseed oil (7%) and wheat germ oil (5%). [ Omega-6 fatty acids ] [ http://www.advance-health.com/efa.html Omega-3 and Omega-6 Essential fatty Acids (EFA) Clear Springs Press 2006 2008-07-18 ] [ http://www.csuchico.edu/agr/grassfedbeef/health-benefits/index.html Grass Fed Beef - Health Benefits Chico College of Agriculture January 18, 2007 2008-07-18 ] Omega-6 fatty acids Omega-6 fatty acids are also important for health. They include the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (LA), which is abundant in vegetable oils grown in temperate climates. Some, such as hemp (60%) and the common margarine oils corn (60%), cottonseed (50%) and sunflower (50%), have large amounts, but most temperate oil seeds have over 10% LA. Margarine is very high in omega-6 fatty acids. Modern Western diets are frequently quite high in Omega-6 but very deficient in Omega-3. The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is typically 10:1 to 30:1. Large amounts of omega-6 decreases the effect of omega-3. Therefore it is recommended that the ratio in the diet should be less than 4:1, although optimal ratio may be closer to 1:1. [ Trans fat ] [ Trans fat ] Unlike other dietary fats, trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health. As with saturated fatty acids, there is a positive linear trend between trans fatty acid intake and LDL cholesterol concentration, and therefore increased risk of coronary heart disease, [ Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients) National Academies Press 2005 504 http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/504.html ] by raising levels of LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of HDL cholesterol. [ Trans fat: Avoid this cholesterol double whammy Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/trans-fat/CL00032 2007-12-10 ] Several large studies have indicated a link between consumption of high amounts of trans fat and coronary heart disease, and possibly some other diseases, { W.C. Willett, M.J. Stampfer, J.E. Mason, G.A. Colditz, F.E. Speizer, B.A. Rosner, L.A. Sampson, C.H.

Linko, The role of trans fatty acids in human nutrition, Journal of Lipid Science and Technology 102, 419-425 (2000) } { The Nurses&apos; Health Study (NHS) } prompting a number of government health agencies across the world to recommend that the intake of trans-fats be minimized. In the US, partial hydrogenation is common as a result of preference for homegrown oils. However, since the mid-1990s, many countries around the world have started to move away from using partially hydrogenated oils. { E. Flöter, G. van Duijn, Trans-free fats for use in foods, in: Modifying lipids for use in foods (editor F.D. Gunstone), Woodhead, Cambridge, UK, 2006, pp. 429-443. } This led to the production of new margarine varieties that contain less or no trans fat. { G. van Duijn, Technical aspects of trans reduction in modified fats, Oléagineux, Corps Gras, Lipides, 12, 422-426 (2005) } [ Cholesterols ] [ Cholesterol ] Excessive cholesterol is a health risk because fatty deposits gradually clog the arteries. This will cause blood flow to the brain, heart, kidneys and other parts of the body to become less efficient. Cholesterol, though needed metabolically, is not essential in the diet. The human body makes cholesterol in the liver, producing about 1g of cholesterol each day or 80% of the needed total body cholesterol. The remaining 20% comes directly from food intake. Therefore overall intake of cholesterol as food has less effect on blood cholesterol levels than the type of fat eaten. [ http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/ The Nutrition Source - Fats and Cholesterol Harvard School of Public Health ] However, some individuals are more responsive to dietary cholesterol than others. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that healthy people should not consume more than 300  mg of cholesterol each day. Most margarines are vegetable-based and thus contains no cholesterol.100  grams of butter contains 178  mg of cholesterol. [ Plant sterol esters and stanol esters ] Plant sterol ester s or plant stanol ester s have been added to some margarines and spreads because of their cholesterol lowering effect. Several studies have indicated that consumption of about 2  grams per day provides a reduction in LDL cholesterol of about 10%.

Many member states currently require the mandatory addition of vitamins A and D to margarine and fat spreads for reasons of public health. Voluntary fortification of margarine with vitamins had been practiced by manufacturers since 1925, but in 1940 with the advent of the war, certain governments took action to safeguard the nutritional status of their nations by making the addition of vitamin A and D compulsory. This mandatory fortification was justified in the view that margarine was being used to replace butter in the diet.

Although fortification with vitamins A and D is still mandatory for margarine, it is only a voluntary requirement for other spreads.
