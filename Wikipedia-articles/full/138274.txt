[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1517676 } [ 3 ] &apos;&apos;&apos;St. Mary of the Rosary Catholic Church in Chewelah, Washington&apos;&apos;&apos; Chewelah ( [ icon tʃ ə ˈ w iː l ə ] [ chə·wē′·lə ] ) is a city in Stevens County, Washington, United States. Chewelah was labeled Chiel-Charle-Mous on the 1897 U. S. Land Office Map. The population was 2,607 at the 2010 census which was a 19.3% increase over the 2000 census. [ History ] The name of the town comes from a Kalispel word, sč̓ewíleʔ, meaning &quot; watersnake &quot; or &quot; gartersnake &quot;. [ Bright William Native American placenames of the United States 2007 University of Oklahoma Press 978-0-8061-3598-4 95 ] { online at Google Books } Prior to colonization by European-Americans, Chewelah was home to a band of the Kalispel people. The band was known as the slet̓éw̓si, meaning &quot; valley people &quot;. Chewelah and the rest of the Colville River Valley were part of the Colville Indian Reservation from April 9, 1872, when the reservation was created, until July 2, 1872, when a subsequent executive order reduced the size of the reservation. The Chewelah Band of Indians is currently part of the Spokane Tribe. In 1873 Thomas and Mary Brown founded the town of Chewelah. They continued using the Salish name for the area as a reference to the winding patterns of the rivers that flowed through the Chewelah Valley. Chewelah was officially incorporated on February 4, 1903. Chewelah is a town of firsts in Stevens County. It had the first Protestant Congregational Church in 1891, the first school in 1869, { &quot; The Last Bell &quot; by Alpa Naff, c. 1984 listed Pinkney City school established 1862 as the first public school in Stevens County. } the Spokane Falls and Northern Railroad arrived in 1889, a Catholic church was established in 1885, and the first county newspaper was founded in July 1885. Initially Chewelah was a typical pioneer settlement, being an agricultural center as far back as the early 1870s and having its share of prospectors working the adjacent countryside as early as 1842. The town was platted in 1884 and became known for being a rough and tumble mining town; the first lead and silver mines were established around 1886, and others followed in Embry and surrounding areas. By 1905 the population had reached 650 souls, and within a few years many prosperous copper, silver, lead and a few gold mines were flourishing in the area. However, the most successful ore to be mined in Chewelah was magnesite. This mineral was used for making bricks and furnace linings that could withstand high temperatures and was an important ingredient for making high-quality steel, in high demand during World War I. Austria had been the main provider of magnesite for the country, but the War interrupted that source. By 1916 Chewelah&apos;s plant was said to be the largest producer of magnesite in the country, and at full production it was the largest producer in the world, shipping some 700 tons daily. During the war there were as many as 800 people working at the plant making refractory brick. By 1920 Chewelah&apos;s population had grown to 1,600 people, and the town continued to prosper until 1968, when the magnesite plant closed down due to cheaper competition from Japan and changes in the steel industry. Despite this major change Chewelah survived the transition from being a &quot; one-company town, &quot; and today Chewelah has several thousand residents and displays a pleasant blend of the past and future. With its moderate climate, dry land, and irrigated farming, ranching and dairy farming continue to be mainstays. Chewelah&apos;s diversified economy includes a ski hill, golf course, and other industries. [ Geography ] Chewelah is located at [ 48 16 50 N 117 43 23 W type:city ] (48.280442, -117.722927).
