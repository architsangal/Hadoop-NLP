The album was produced by The Get Up Kids themselves, with co-producers Chad Blinman and Alex Brahl. Blinman also recorded and mixed the album, with Brahl assisting with additional engineering. The album was a financial success, peaking at #31 on Billboard s Heatseekers 200 albums chart in North America, and gathered a great amount of critical acclaim. Something to Write Home About is the first Get Up Kids album to include James Dewees playing keyboards. After The Get Up Kids&apos; previous album, Four Minute Mile brought major label offers, the band decided to stick with an indie label and sign with Vagrant Records for their next album after a short and unproductive time with Mojo Records. Something to Write Home About is, however, slightly more radio-oriented, with catchy choruses and hooks. [ Recording ] At the time the band signed onto Vagrant Records, the label was still primarily a much smaller independent label. Before the album went into production, the label&apos;s co-owner John Cohen [ June 2011 ] had to borrow money from his parents, who mortgaged their house in order to fund the production of the album. [ Kelley Trevor Say Goodnight, Mean Goodbye: The Oral History of The Get Up Kids Alternative Press Issue #204 ] At least one of the songs were inspired by the band&apos;s tumultuous split with Doghouse Records. The album was recorded over the course of two months in June and July 1999, with Chad Blinman at the Mad Hatter Recording Studios in Silverlake, California. The band produced the record themselves, with co-producers Chad Blinman - who mixed the album - and Alex Brahl, who did additional engineering on the album and would later go onto co-found Curb Appeal Records with The Get Up Kids guitarist Jim Suptic. [ Promotion ] Two singles were released to promote this album. The first, Ten Minutes was released through the Sub Pop Singles Club on 7 &quot; Vinyl in February 1999.

[ The Get Up Kids Band History http://www.epitaph.com/artists/artist/75/Get_Up_Kids#albdesc Epitaph Records 07-12-2009 ] The band toured for three years after the release of the album, up until they went into the studio on their next album On a Wire. This included supporting Green Day on their Warning tour, a 2000 tour with Koufax and The Anniversary sponsored by Napster, [ Harlow Luke Rob Pope of The Get Up Kids http://www.decapolis.com/musicreviews/interviews/getupkid.shtml Decapolis 2000-09-02 2009-06-02 ] as well as an opening spot on the 2001 Yahoo! Outloud tour with Ozma and Weezer. After the tour ended, the band was physically and mentally fatigued, and looked to write a significantly different album, reflected in the darker and more mature tone of On a Wire.

[ Re-release ] In August 2008, rumors began to spread that the band will be releasing a special edition of the album in 2009 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of its release, including a DVD chronicling the band&apos;s history.

Speculation was fueled further when, in an interview with Mishmash Magazine, Dewees confirmed that he was working on the reunion of &quot; an old band from the 90&apos;s and early 2000&apos;s &quot;.
