The modern state of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 with the union of the kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd. Although the territory within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&apos;s boundaries is largely arid desert or rocky infertile terrain – home for much of its history to tribal nomadic societies with only rudimentary state structures – it has twice in world history had a global impact. The first was in the 7th century when it became the cradle of Islam. The second was from the mid-20th century when the discovery of vast oil deposits propelled it into a key economic and geo-political role. At other times, the region existed in relative obscurity and isolation, although from the 7th century the cities of Mecca and Medina had the highest spiritual significance for the Islamic world, Mecca being the destination for the Hajj annual pilgrimage. Present Saudi Arabia [ Early history ] { Tribes of Arabia at the time of the } { Rise of Islam (expandable map) } [ Pre-Islamic Arabia ] There is evidence that human habitation in the Arabian peninsula dates back to about 15,000 to 20,000 years ago. { Saudi Embassy (US) Website retrieved 20 Jan 2011 } However, the harsh climate historically prevented much settlement. In pre-Islamic Arabia, apart from a small number of urban trading settlements, such as Mecca and Medina, located in the Hejaz in the west of the peninsula, most of what was to become Saudi Arabia was populated by nomadic tribal societies or uninhabitable desert. Archaeology, however, revealed some early settled cultures: the Dilmun on the Persian Gulf, and Thamud north of the Hejaz. The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas. { Philip Khuri Hitti (2002), History of the Arabs, Revised: 10th Edition } [ The rise of Islam ] [ Muslim history ] The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but migrated to Medina in 622. From there he and his companions united the tribes of Arabia under the banner of Islam and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.[[File:Age-of-caliphs.png|thumb|right|300px|The Islamic World expansion, 622-750 [ #a1584e Expansion 622-632 ] [ #ef9070 Expansion 632-661 ] [ #fad07d Expansion 661-750 ] ]]Following Muhammad&apos;s death in 632, Abu Bakr became leader of the Muslims as the first Caliph. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the Ridda wars, or &quot; Wars of Apostasy &quot; ), Abu Bakr attacked the Byzantine Empire. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by Umar as caliph, followed by Uthman ibn al-Affan and Ali ibn Abi Talib. The period of these first four caliphs is known as al-khulafā&apos; ar-rāshidūn (R.A): the Rashidun or &quot; rightly guided &quot; Caliphate. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their Umayyad successors, the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the Byzantine army and destroyed the Persian Empire, conquering huge swathes of territory from the Iberian peninsula to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories. { See: Holt (1977a), p.57, Hourani (2003), p.22, Lapidus (2002), p.32, Madelung (1996), p.43, Tabatabaei (1979), p.30–50 } [ Islam Encyclopaedia of Islam Online L. Gardet J. Jomier 2007-05-02 ] Nevertheless, Mecca and Medina remained the spiritually most important places in the Muslim world. The Qu&apos;ran requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the five pillars of Islam, to make a pilgrimage, or Hajj, to Mecca during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah at least once in his or her lifetime. { Farah, Caesar (1994). Islam: Beliefs and Observances (5th ed.),pp.145–147 ISBN 978-0-8120-1853-0 } The Masjid al-Haram (the Grand Mosque) in Mecca is the location of the Kaaba, Islam&apos;s holiest site, and the Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet&apos;s Mosque) in Medina is the location of Muhammad tomb; as a result, from the 7th century, Mecca and Medina became the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the Islamic world. { Goldschmidt, Jr., Arthur; Lawrence Davidson (2005). A Concise History of the Middle East (8th ed.), p.48 ISBN 978-0-8133-4275-7 } [ The Middle Ages ] Despite its spiritual importance, in political terms Arabia soon became a peripheral region of the Islamic world, in which the most important medieval Islamic states were based at various times in such far away cities as Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo. Most of what was to become Saudi Arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule soon after the initial Muslim conquests, and remained a shifting patchwork of tribes and tribal emirate s and confederations of varying durability. { Encyclopædia Britannica Online: History of Arabia retrieved 18 Jan. 2011 } { Encyclopædia Britannica Online: Saudi Arabia History } However, from the 10th century (and, in fact, until the 20th century) the Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca maintained a state in the most developed part of the region, the Hejaz. Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of Mecca and Medina but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the Hejaz. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the Hejaz, they were usually subject to the suzerainty of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the Abbasids of Baghdad, and the Fatimids, Ayyubids and Mamluks of Egypt. io4,` [ The Ottoman Era ] [ Ottoman Empire ] The Ottoman Empire in 1914, including nominal and vassal Ottoman territories – the position in Arabia had largely been the same for the previous 400 years Beginning with Selim I&apos;s acquisition of Medina and Mecca in 1517, the Ottomans, in the 16th century, added to their Empire the Hejaz and Asir regions along the Red Sea and the Al Hasa region on the Persian Gulf coast, these being the most populous parts of what was to become Saudi Arabia. They also laid claim to the interior, although this remained a rather nominal suzerainty. The degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the Empire&apos;s central authority. In the Hejaz, the Sharifs of Mecca were largely left in control of their territory (although there would often be an Ottoman governor and garrison in Mecca ). On the eastern side of the country, the Ottomans lost control of the Al Hasa region to Arab tribes in the 17th century but regained it again in the 19th century. Throughout the period, the interior remained under the rule of a large number of petty tribal rulers in much the same way as it had in previous centuries. { Goodwin, Jason. Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire (2003) Amazon.com } [ 18th century: the rise of Wahhabism and the first Saudi &quot; state &quot; ] { First Saudi State (1744–1818) } [ First Saudi State Second Saudi State Al Rashid Wahhabi ] The emergence of the Saudi dynasty began in central Arabia in 1744. In that year, Muhammad ibn Saud, the tribal ruler of the town of Ad-Dir&apos;iyyah near Riyadh, joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, { King Abdul Aziz Information Resource – First Ruler of the House of Saud retrieved 20 Jan 2011 } the founder of the Wahhabi movement – a radical form of Islam. { &apos;Wahhabi&apos;, Encyclopædia Britannica Online retrieved 20 Jan. 2011 } This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the idealogical impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today. Over the next 150 years, the fortunes of the Saud family rose and fell several times as Saudi rulers contended with Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, and other Arabian families for control of the peninsula. { Second Saudi State (1824–1891) at its greatest extent } The first &apos;Saudi State&apos; was established in 1744 in the area around Riyadh and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia through conquests made between 1786 and 1816; these included Mecca and Medina. { The Saud Family and Wahhabi Islam. } { Library of Congress Country Studies. } Concerned at the growing power of the Saudis, the Ottoman Sultan, Mustafa IV, instructed his viceroy in Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha, to reconquer the area. Ali sent his sons Tusun Pasha and Ibrahim Pasha who were eventually successful in routing the Saudi forces in 1818 and destroyed the power of the Al Saud. { Al-Rashid rule at its greatest extent } [ 19th century: tribal warfare and Ottoman domination ] The Al Saud returned to power in 1824 but their area of control was mainly restricted to the Saudi heartland of the Nejd region, known as the second &apos;Saudi State&apos;. However, their rule in Nejd was soon contested by new rivals, the Al Rashid of Ha&apos;il. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Al Saud and the Al Rashid fought for control of the interior of what was to become Saudi Arabia. By 1891, the Al Saud were conclusively defeated by the Al Rashid, who drove the Saudis into exile in Kuwait. { Global Security Retrieved 19 Jan. 2011 } Meanwhile, in the Hejaz, following the defeat of the first Saudi State, the Egyptians continued to occupy the area until 1840. After they left, the Sharifs of Mecca reasserted their authority, albeit with the presence of an Ottoman governor and garrison. [ The Arab Revolt (1916–1918) ] [ Arab Revolt ] { Flag of the Arab Revolt and pictured in the Arabian Desert. } By the early 20th century, the Ottoman Empire continued to control or have suzerainty (albeit nominal) over most of the peninsula. Subject to this suzerainty, Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers (including the Al Saud who had returned from exile in 1902 – see below ) with the Sharif of Mecca having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz. { David Murphy, The Arab Revolt 1916-18: Lawrence Sets Arabia Ablaze, Osprey Publishing, 2008, } In 1916, with the encouragement and support of Britain and France { Murphy, David The Arab Revolt 1916-1918, London: Osprey, 2008 page 18 } (which were fighting the Ottomans in the First World War ), the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, led a pan-Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire with the aim of securing Arab independence and creating a single unified Arab state spanning the Arab territories from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen. The Arab army comprised bedouin and others from across the peninsula, but not the Al Saud and their allied tribes who did not participate in the revolt partly because of a long-standing rivalry with the Sharifs of Mecca and partly because their priority was to defeat the Al Rashid for control of the interior. Nevertheless, the revolt played a part in the Middle-Eastern Front and tied down thousands of Ottoman troops thereby contributing to the Ottomans&apos; First World War defeat in 1918. { David Murphy, The Arab Revolt 1916-18: Lawrence Sets Arabia Ablaze, Osprey Publishing, 2008 } However, with the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, the British and French reneged on promises to Hussein to support a pan-Arab state. Although Hussein was acknowledged as King of the Hejaz, Britain later shifted support to the Al Saud, leaving him diplomatically and militarily isolated. The revolt, therefore, failed in its objective to create a pan-Arab state but Arabia was freed from Ottoman suzerainty and control. [ Abdul Aziz and the foundation of Saudi Arabia ] [ Unification of Saudi Arabia ] { Abdul Aziz&apos;s domain is in blue with dates of conquest. The Kingdom of the } { Hejaz, conquered in 1925, is in light green. (The other } { Hashemite kingdoms of } { Iraq and } { Transjordan are also in shades of green) } In 1902, Abdul-Aziz bin Saud, leader of the Al Saud, returned from exile in Kuwait ( see above ) to resume the conflict with the Al Rashid, and seized Riyadh – the first of a series of conquests ultimately leading to the creation of the modern state of Saudi Arabia in 1932. The main weapon for achieving these conquests was the Ikhwan, the Wahhabist - Bedouin tribal army led by Sultan Bin Bajad Al Otaibi and Faisal al-Dwaish. { King Abdul Aziz Information Resource retrieved 19 January 2011 } { &apos;Arabian Sands&apos; by } { Wilfred Thesiger, 1991 } By 1906, Abdul-Aziz had driven the Al Rashid out of Nejd and the Ottomans recognized him as their client in Nejd. His next major acquisition was Al-Hasa, which he took from the Ottomans in 1913 bringing him control of the Persian Gulf coast and what would become Saudi Arabia&apos;s vast oil reserves. He avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt, having acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty in 1914, and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid in northern Arabia. In 1920, the Ikhwan&apos;s attention turned to the south-west, when they seized Asir, the region between the Hejaz and Yemen. In the following year, Abdul-Aziz finally defeated the Al Rashid and annexed all northern Arabia. Prior to 1923, Abdul Aziz had not risked invading the Hejaz because Hussein bin Ali, King of the Hejaz, was supported by Britain. However, in that year, the British withdrew their support and the Ikhwan attacked the Hejaz, completing its conquest by the end of 1925. On January 10, 1926 Abdul-Aziz declared himself King of the Hejaz and, then, on January 27, 1927 he took the title King of Nejd (his previous title was Sultan). By the Treaty of Jeddah, signed on May 20, 1927, the United Kingdom recognized the independence of Abdul-Aziz&apos;s realm (then known as the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd). After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leaders wanted to continue the expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait. Abdul-Aziz, however, refused to agree to this, recognizing the danger of a direct conflict with the British. The Ikhwan therefore revolted but were defeated in the Battle of Sabilla in 1930,and the Ikhwan leadership were massacred. { &apos;Arabian Sands&apos; by } { Wilfred Thesiger, 1991, pps 248-249 } In 1932, the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the &apos;Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&apos;. Boundaries with Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait were established by a series of treaties negotiated in the 1920s, with two &quot; neutral zone s &quot; created, one with Iraq and the other with Kuwait. The country&apos;s southern boundary with Yemen was partially defined by the 1934 Treaty of Ta&apos;if, which ended a brief border war between the two states. { Country Data – External boundaries retrieved 19 January 2011 } Abdul Aziz&apos;s military and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of oil were discovered in 1938 in the Al-Hasa region along the Persian Gulf coast. Development began in 1941 and by 1949 production was in full swing. Abdul Aziz died in 1953. Only sons of Abdul Aziz have, to date, ascended the Saudi throne. The number of children that he fathered is unknown, but it is believed that he had 22 wives and 37 sons, of whom five have become King. { http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2526 } Prior to his death, he chose Saud as his immediate successor. [ Discovery of Oil ] Abdul Aziz&apos;s military and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of oil were discovered in 1938 in the Al-Hasa region along the Persian Gulf coast. Prior to the discovery of oil, the main source of income for the government depended on the pilgrimage to Makkah, which was around 100,000 people per year in the late 1920s. In the 1930s, Abdul Aziz granted an economic concession to the Standard Oil Company of California to drill for oil in his kingdom, after oil was found in nearby Bahrain in 1932. Oil wells were constructed in Dhahran in the late 1930s, and by 1939, the kingdom began to export oil. During and after World War Two, production of Saudi oil expanded, with much of the oil being sold to the Allies. Aramco (the Arabian American Oil Company) built an underwater pipeline to Bahrain to help increase oil flow in 1945. Between 1939 and 1953, oil revenues from Saudi Arabia increased from $7 million to over $200 million, and the kingdom began to be entirely dependent on oil income.

Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of political leverage in the international community. The sudden wealth from increased production was a mixed blessing. Cultural life rapidly developed, primarily in the Hejaz, which was the center for newspapers and radio, but the large influx of foreigners increased the pre-existing propensity for xenophobia. At the same time, the government became increasingly wasteful and lavish. Despite the new wealth, extravagant spending led to governmental deficits and foreign borrowing in the 1950s. { al-Rasheed, Madawi, A History of Saudi Arabia (Cambridge University Press, 2002) ISBN 0-521-64335-X } { Robert Lacey, THE KINGDOM: Arabia &amp; The House of Sa&apos;ud, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc, 1981 (Hard Cover) and Avon Books, 1981 (Soft Cover).

As a consequence, Saud was deposed in favor of Faisal in 1964. The mid-1960s saw external pressures generated by Saudi-Egyptian differences over Yemen. When civil war broke out in 1962 between Yemeni royalists and republicans, Egyptian forces entered Yemen to support the new republican government, while Saudi Arabia backed the royalists. Tensions subsided only after 1967, when Egypt withdrew its troops from Yemen. Saudi forces did not participate in the Six-Day (Arab-Israeli) War of June 1967, but the government later provided annual subsidies to Egypt, Jordan, and Syria to support their economies. { Background note: Saudi Arabia US State Department } { Saudi Aramco headquarters complex. The Saudi government took a 25% share in Aramco in 1973, increased it to 60% in 1974, and fully nationalized it in 1980 } In 1965 there was an exchange of territories between Saudi Arabia and Jordan in which Jordan gave up a relatively large area of inland desert in return for a small piece of seashore near Aqaba.The Saudi-Kuwaiti neutral zone was administratively partitioned in 1971, with each state continuing to share the petroleum resources of the former zone equally. The Saudi economy and infrastructure was developed with help from abroad, particularly from the United States, creating strong links between the two dissimilar countries, and considerable and problematic American presence in the Kingdom. The Saudi petroleum industry under the company of ARAMCO was built by American petroleum companies, U.S. construction companies such as Bechtel built much of the country&apos;s infrastruture, Trans World Airlines, built the Saudi passenger air service; the Ford Foundation modernized Saudi government; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the country&apos;s television and broadcast facilities and oversaw the development of its defense industry. { Wright, Lawrence, Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, by Lawrence Wright, NY, Knopf, 2006, p.152 } During the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Saudi Arabia participated in the Arab oil boycott of the United States and Netherlands. A member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia had joined other member countries in moderate oil price increases beginning in 1971. After the 1973 war, the price of oil rose substantially, dramatically increasing Saudi Arabia&apos;s wealth and political influence. Faisal was assassinated in 1975 by his nephew, Prince Faisal bin Musa&apos;id. { Robert Lacey, The Kingdom: Arabia and the House of Saud (Harcourt, Brace and Jovanovich Publishing: New York, 1981) p. 426. } [ Khalid&apos;s reign: 1975-1982 ] { seizure of the Grand Mosque,1979 under custody of Saudi authorities. c. 1980. } Faisal was succeeded by his half-brother King Khalid during whose reign economic and social development continued at an extremely rapid rate, revolutionizing the infrastructure and educational system of the country; in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed. In 1979, two events occurred which the Al Saud perceived as threatening the regime, and had a long-term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy. The first was the Iranian Islamic revolution. It was feared that the country&apos;s Shi&apos;ite minority in the Eastern Province (which is also the location of the oil fields) – might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co-religionists. In fact there were several anti-government riots in the region in 1979 and 1980. The second event, was the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi regime. [ Hegghammer 2010 ] { &apos;Jihad in Saudi Arabia: Violence and Pan-Islamism since 1979&apos; by Thomas Hegghammer, 2010, Cambridge Middle East Studies ISBN 978-0-521-73236-9 } Part of the response of the royal family was to enforce a much stricter observance of Islamic and traditional Saudi norms in the country (for example, the closure of cinemas) and to give the Ulema a greater role in government. Neither entirely succeeded as Islamism continued to grow in strength. King Khalid empowered Crown Prince Fahd to oversee many aspects of the government&apos;s international and domestic affairs. Economic development continued rapidly under King Khalid, and the kingdom assumed a more influential role in regional politics and international economic and financial matters. During the 1970s and 1980s, more than 45,000 Saudi students per year went to the United States, while more than 200,000 Americans have lived and worked in the Kingdom since the discovery of oil. A tentative agreement on the partition of the Saudi-Iraqi neutral zone was reached in 1981. The governments finalized the partition in 1983. King Khalid died in June 1982. [ Fahd&apos;s reign: 1982-2005 ] { Operation Desert Storm, 1991 } Khalid was succeeded by his brother King Fahd in 1982, who maintained Saudi Arabia’s foreign policy of close cooperation with the United States and increased purchases of sophisticated military equipment from the United States and Britain. In the 1970s and ’80s, the country had become the largest oil producer in the world. Oil revenues were crucial to Saudi society as its economy was changed by the extraordinary wealth it generated and which was channeled through the government. Urbanization, mass public education, the presence of numerous foreign workers, and access to new media all affected Saudi values. While society changed profoundly, political processes did not. Real power continued to be held almost exclusively by the royal family, leading to disaffection with many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 Saudi Arabia joined the anti-Iraq Coalition and King Fahd, fearing an attack from Iraq, invited American and Coalition soldiers to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi troops and aircraft took part in the subsequent military operations. However, allowing Coalition forces to be based in the country proved to be one of the issues that has led to an increase in Islamic terrorism in Saudi Arabia, as well as Islamic terrorist attacks in Western countries by Saudi nationals – the 9/11 attacks in New York being the most prominent example. [ Hegghammer 2010 112 ] {. } Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the regime. Although now extremely wealthy, the country&apos;s economy was near stagnant, which, combined with a growth in unemployment, contributed to disquiet in the country, and was reflected in a subsequent rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited &apos;reforms&apos; were initiated (such as the Basic Law ). However, the royal family&apos;s dilemma was to respond to dissent while making as few actual changes in the status quo as possible. Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind: “A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [shūrā].” In 1995, Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke and the Crown Prince, Prince Abdullah assumed day-to-day responsibility for the government, albeit his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd&apos;s full brothers, the Sudairi &apos;clan&apos;. Abdullah continued the policy of mild reform and greater openness, but in addition, adopted a foreign policy distancing the kingdom from the US. In 2003, Saudi Arabia refused to support the US and its allies in the invasion of Iraq. However, terrorist activity increased dramatically in 2003, with the Riyadh compound bombings and other attacks, which prompted the government to take much more stringent action against terrorism. Building #131 after the Khobar Towers bombing, which was the second major terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia, 1996 [ Abdullah&apos;s reign: 2005 to the present ] In 2005, King Fahd died and his half-brother, Abdullah ascended to the throne. The king subsequently introduced a new program of moderate reform. The country’s continued reliance on oil revenue was of particular concern, and among the economic reforms he introduced were limited deregulation, foreign investment, and privatization. He has taken much more vigorous action to deal with the origins of Islamic terrorism, and has ordered the use of force for the first time by the security services against some extremists. In February 2009, Abdullah introduced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary, armed forces, and various ministries to modernize these institutions. Notable among his decisions were the replacement of senior individuals within the judiciary and the Mutaween (religious police) with more moderate candidates and the appointment of the country’s first female deputy minister. { &apos;The Monarch Who Declared His Own Revolution&apos; by Christopher Dickey, Newsweek, 21 March 2009 http://www.newsweek.com/2009/03/20/the-monarch-who-declared-his-own-revolution.html } [ See also ] [ 3 ] European exploration of Arabia Hejaz History of Asia History of the Middle East Kindah List of Kings of Saudi Arabia Nejd Politics of Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia [ Wikipedia_-_History_of_Saudi_Arabia.ogg 2008-03-30 ] [ References ] ar:تاريخ السعودية bn:সৌদি আরবের ইতিহাস cs:Dějiny Saúdské Arábie de:Geschichte Saudi-Arabiens es:Historia de Arabia Saudita fr:Histoire de l&apos;Arabie saoudite it:Storia dell&apos;Arabia Saudita he:היסטוריה של ערב הסעודית ms:Sejarah Arab Saudi nl:Geschiedenis van Saoedi-Arabië no:Saudi-Arabias historie pt:História da Arábia Saudita ro:Istoria Arabiei Saudite ru:История Саудовской Аравии sq:Historia e Arabisë Saudite simple:History of Saudi Arabia sv:Saudiarabiens historia uk:Історія Саудівської Аравії
