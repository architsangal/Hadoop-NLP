The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) is a collaborative project of volunteers who use freely available software to search for Mersenne prime numbers. The project was founded by George Woltman, who also wrote the software Prime95 and MPrime for the project. Scott Kurowski wrote the Internet PrimeNet Server that supports the research to demonstrate Entropia -distributed computing software, a company he founded in 1997. GIMPS is registered as Mersenne Research, Inc. Kurowski is Executive Vice President and board director of Mersenne Research Inc. GIMPS is said to be one of the first large scale distributed computing projects over the Internet for research purposes. [ August 2010 ] The project has found a total of thirteen Mersenne primes [ 2011 11 09 on ], eleven of which were the largest known prime number at their respective times of discovery. The largest known prime [ 2011 11 on http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id%3D3 ] is 2 43,112,609  −  1 (or M 43,112,609 in short). This prime was discovered on 23 August 2008 by Edson Smith at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)&apos;s Mathematics Department. { GIMPS home page. Retrieved 16 September 2008. } This prime allowed GIMPS to win the $100,000 prize from Electronic Frontier Foundation for discovering a prime with more than 10 million decimal digits. { Record 12-Million-Digit Prime Number Nets $100,000 Prize: Mersenne.org Wins EFF&apos;s Cooperative Computing Award } Refer to the article on Mersenne prime numbers for the complete list of GIMPS successes. To perform its testing, the project relies primarily on Édouard Lucas and Derrick Henry Lehmer &apos;s primality test, { &apos;&apos;What are Mersenne primes? How are they useful?&apos;&apos; - GIMPS Home Page } an algorithm that is both specialized to testing Mersenne primes and particularly efficient on binary computer architecture s. They also have a less expensive trial division phase, taking hours instead of weeks, used to rapidly eliminate Mersenne numbers with small factors, which make up a large proportion of candidates. John Pollard&apos;s p  −  1 algorithm is also used to search for larger factors.

[ http://www.eff.org/awards/coop.php EFF Cooperative Computing Awards Electronic Frontier Foundation 2011-09-19 ] [ Primes found ] All Mersenne primes are in the form M q, where q is the (prime) exponent. The prime number itself is [ 2 q − 1, ] so the smallest prime number in this table is [ 2 1398269 − 1. ] Mn is the rank of the Mersenne prime based on its exponent. As of Feb 17, 2012, M41 is the largest Mersenne prime for which it is known that there is no other unknown Mersenne prime below, with a lower exponent, since all Mersenne numbers with prime exponent below 24,212,801 have been checked twice. { GIMPS Milestones } Discovery date Prime M q Digits count Name Mn Electronic machine platform 13 November 1996 M 1398269 420,921 M35 Pentium (90 MHz ) 24 August 1997 M 2976221 895,932 M36 Pentium (100  MHz) 27 January 1998 M 3021377 909,526 M37 Pentium (200  MHz) 1 June 1999 M 6972593 2,098,960 M38 Pentium (350  MHz) 14 November 2001 M 13466917 4,053,946 M39 AMD T-Bird (800  MHz) 17 November 2003 M 20996011 6,320,430 M40 Pentium (2  GHz) 15 May 2004 M 24036583 7,235,733 M41 Pentium 4 (2.4  GHz) 18 February 2005 M 25964951 7,816,230 M42 ?

Intel Core 2 Duo (3  GHz) The number M 43112609 has 12,978,189 digits. To help visualize the size of this number, a standard word processor layout (50 lines per page, 75 digits per line) would require 3,461 pages to display it. If one were to print it out using standard printer paper, single-sided, it would require approximately 7 reams of paper. Whenever a possible prime is reported to the server, it is verified first before it is announced. The importance of this was illustrated in 2003, when a false positive was reported to possibly be the 40th Mersenne prime but verification failed.
