With the neighbouring parishes of Coates, Eastrea and Pondersbridge, it has an approximate population of 15,000. [ Location ] Whittlesey is located between the city of Peterborough, 6 miles (10  km) to the west and the town of March, 11 miles (18  km) to the east, and is bordered to the north by the River Nene and to the south by Whittlesey Dyke. Historically it was connected to Peterborough and March by the Roman road Fen Causeway constructed in the first century AD, a route approximately followed by the modern A605. The rail station is on the line between Peterborough and Ely (historically the Great Eastern Line), with direct trains to Cambridge, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leicester, Stansted Airport and others. [ History and architecture ] Whittlesey appears in the Domesday Book as Witesie, but it is probable that the name derives from Whittle&apos;s Ea, where Ea is a Saxon term for an island. Indeed the land was once owned and presided over by a man named &apos;Whittle&apos;, so the name literally translates as &apos;Whittle&apos;s Island&apos;. [ November 2008 ] St. Marys spire viewed from the west. Before the draining of the fens, Whittlesey was an island of dry ground surrounded by the marshy fens. Excavations of nearby Flag Fen indicate thriving local settlements as far back as 1000 BC. In more recent times Whittlesey was linked to Peterborough in the west and March in the east by the Roman Fen Causeway, probably built in the 1st century AD, and Roman artefacts have been recovered at nearby Eldernell. [ October 2009 ] In 2010, in the nearby village of Eastrea, a Roman skeleton was discovered. Named &apos;Maximus&apos; by villagers, the 2000 year old skeleton was unearthed during an archaeological dig on the proposed site of the new Eastrea village hall.
