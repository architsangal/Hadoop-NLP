[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1247197 } [ 3 ] Cayce is a city in Lexington and Richland counties in the U.S. state of South Carolina, along the Congaree River. The population was 12,528 at the 2010 census. [ 8 ] It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area. Cayce lies mostly across the Congaree River from the state capital of Columbia, with a newly annexed section on the Richland County side awaiting development. Because both it and the neighboring town of West Columbia share road names and schools, they are sometimes referred to jointly as Cayce-West Columbia. However, they are politically separate towns. The Congaree River has always played a dominant role of strategic importance in Cayce&apos;s development. Cayce and other local governments jointly developed the Riverwalk along the Congaree, which provides walking, jogging, and nature observation opportunities. Development on both sides of the river is an important factor driving the city&apos;s economy. [ History ] European settlement of the area dates back to the 18th century, when the area was considered part of Granby, a town that later failed due to endemic malaria. A handful of Revolutionary War skirmishes were fought in what is now Cayce. The town was incorporated in 1914 and named for local businessman William J. Cayce. [ Transportation ] Cayce is traversed by I-26 and I-77, and the Columbia Metropolitian Airport ( IATA :CAE) is adjacent to the town limits.
