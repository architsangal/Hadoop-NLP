[ April 2012 ] [ 1721 4 26 y ] { ( } { New Style ) } { Leicester House, } { London } [ 1765 10 31 1721 4 26 yes ] { London } { Westminster Abbey, London } Prince William Augustus (26 April 1721 [ N.S. ] – 31 October 1765), was a younger son of George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach, and Duke of Cumberland from 1726. He is generally best remembered for his role in putting down the Jacobite Rising at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, and as such is also known as &quot; Butcher &quot; Cumberland. After Culloden, he went on to a largely unsuccessful military career, and following the Convention of Klosterzeven in 1757, he never held active military command, and switched his attentions to politics and horse racing. [ Early life ] William was born in Leicester House, in Leicester Fields (now Leicester Square ), Westminster, London, where his parents had moved after his grandfather, George I, accepted the invitation to ascend the British throne. [ http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29455 Prince William, Duke of Cumberland Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 5 May 2012 ] His godparents included the King and Queen in Prussia (his paternal aunt), but they apparently did not take part in person and were presumably represented by proxy. [ http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings Yvonne&apos;s Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings Users.uniserve.com 2010-06-21 ] On 27 July 1726, [ http://mypage.uniserve.ca/~canyon/peerage_titles.htm#Holders Yvonne&apos;s Royalty: Peerage Mypage.uniserve.ca 2010-06-21 ] at only four-years-old, he was created Duke of Cumberland, Marquess of Berkhamstead in the County of Hertford, Earl of Kennington in the County of Surrey, Viscount of Trematon in the County of Cornwall, and Baron of the Isle of Alderney. [ 6494 1 12 July 1726 5 May 2012 ] The young prince was educated well; his mother appointed Edmond Halley as a tutor. { Van der Kiste, p. 46 } Another of his tutors (and occasional proxy for him) was his mother&apos;s favourite Andrew Fountaine. [ 6382 2 15 June 1725 5 May 2012 ] At Hampton Court Palace, apartments were designed specially for him by William Kent. { Thurley p. 279 } William&apos;s elder brother Frederick, Prince of Wales, proposed dividing the king&apos;s dominions. Frederick would get Britain, and William Hanover. This proposal came to nothing. { Van der Kiste, p. 150 (1736 plan suggested by Prince of Wales) } [ Early military career ] From childhood, he showed physical courage and ability, and became his parents&apos; favourite. { Van der Kiste, p. 111 } He was enrolled in the 2nd Foot Guards and made a Knight of the Bath aged four. { Van der Kiste, p. 78 } He was intended, by the King and Queen, for the office of Lord High Admiral, and, in 1740, he sailed, as a volunteer, in the fleet under the command of Sir John Norris, but he quickly became dissatisfied with the Navy, and, instead secured the post of colonel of the First Regiment of Foot Guards on 20 February 1741. [ 8094 2 16 February 1741 5 May 2012 ] [ War of the Austrian Succession ] In December 1742, he became a major-general, and, the following year, he first saw active service in Germany. George II and the &quot; martial boy &quot; shared in the glory of the Battle of Dettingen (27 June 1743), [ 8286 2 20 December 1743 5 May 2012 ] and Cumberland, who was wounded in the leg by a musket ball. After the battle he was made a lieutenant general. [ 8240 4 12 July 1743 5 May 2012 ] { Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 was Cumberland&apos;s first battle as commander. } In 1745 Cumberland was given the honorary title of Captain-General of the British land forces and in Flanders became Commander-in-Chief of the allied British, Hanoverian, Austrian and Dutch troops despite his inexperience. He initially planned to take the offensive against the French, in a move he hoped would lead to the capture of Paris, but was persuaded by his advisors that this was impossible given the vast numerical superiority of the enemy. { Browning p. 206 } As it became clear that the French intention was to take Tournai, Cumberland advanced to the relief of the town, which was besieged by Marshal Saxe. In the resulting Battle of Fontenoy on 11 May 1745 the Allies were defeated by the French. { Browning p. 212 } Saxe had picked the battleground on which to confront the British, and filled the nearby woods with French marksmen. Cumberland ignored the threat of the woods when drawing up his battle plans, and instead concentrated on seizing the town of Fontenoy and attacking the main French army nearby. Despite a concerted Anglo-Hanoverian attack on the French centre, which led many to believe the Allies had won, the failure to clear the woods and of the Dutch forces to capture Fontenoy forced Cumberland&apos;s force onto the retreat. Following the battle Cumberland was frequently criticised for his tactics, particularly the failure to occupy the woods. { Browning pp. 207-213 } In the wake of the battle Cumberland was forced to retreat to Brussels and was unable to prevent the fall of Ghent, Bruges and Ostend. { Browning p. 219 } [ george2 ] &quot; The Highlanders Medley &quot;, or &quot; The Duke Triumphant &quot; Published according to Act of Parliament, 1749 &quot; The Tombstone &quot;, published October 1765 [ Jacobite rebellion - &quot; The Forty-Five &quot; ] As the leading British general of the day, he was chosen to put a decisive stop to Charles Edward Stuart, known as the Young Pretender, in the Jacobite rising of 1745. His appointment was popular, and caused morale to soar amongst the British public and troops. { Longmate p. 155 } Recalled from Flanders, Cumberland proceeded with preparations for quelling the insurrection. The Jacobite army had advanced southwards into England, hoping that English Jacobites would rise and join them. However after only receiving limited support such as the Manchester Regiment, the Jacobites decided to withdraw to Scotland. { Pollard p.41-42 } Cumberland joined the Midland army under Ligonier, and began pursuit of the enemy, as the Stuart&apos;s retreated northwards from Derby. On reaching Penrith, the advanced portion of his army was repulsed on Clifton Moor in December 1745, and Cumberland became aware that an attempt to overtake the retreating Highlanders would be hopeless. [ http://www.thesonsofscotland.co.uk/thebattleofcliftonmoor1745.htm Clifton skirmish Paisley Tartan Army 5 May 2012 ] Carlisle was retaken, and he was recalled to London, where preparations were in hand to meet a suspected French invasion. The defeat of his replacement as commander, Henry Hawley, roused the fears of the English people in January 1746, when, under a hail of pistol fire, &quot; eighty dragoons fell dead upon the spot &quot; at Falkirk Muir. { Tomasson, p 119 } [ Culloden ] [ Battle of Culloden ] Arriving in Edinburgh on 30 January 1746, he at once proceeded in search of the Young Pretender. He made a detour to Aberdeen, [ 8521 2 22 March 1746 5 May 2012 ] where he spent some time training the well-equipped forces now under his command for the next stage of the conflict in which they were about to engage. He trained his troops to hold their fire until the enemy came within effective firing range, fire once, and then bayonet the man to the right therby catching the emeny under their lifted sword arm. { Bellesiles, p.145 } On 8 April 1746, he set out from Aberdeen for Inverness, and, on 16 April, he fought the decisive Battle of Culloden, in which the forces of the Young Pretender were completely destroyed. Cumberland ordered his troops to show no quarter against any remaining Jacobite rebels ( French Army personnel, including those who were British- or Irish-born, were treated as legitimate combatants). His troops traversed the battlefield and stabbed any of the rebel soldiers who were still alive. { Thompson, p.519 } When Cumberland learnt that a wounded soldier lying at his feet belonged to the rebel cause he instructed a major to shoot the rebel; when the major refused Cumberland commanded a private soldier to complete the required duty. The British Army then embarked upon the so-called &apos;pacification&apos; of Jacobite areas of the highlands. All those the troops believed to be rebels were killed, as were some non-combatants; &apos;rebellious&apos; settlements were burned and livestock was confiscated on a large scale. { Plank, p.116 } Over a hundred rebels where hanged. { Clee, p.42 } Women were imprisoned and droves of people were sent by ship to London for trial and as the journey took up to 8 months many of them died on the way. [ &quot; Butcher Cumberland &quot; ] &quot; Butcher &quot; was a taunt, first recorded in the City of London, [ http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Letters-of-Horace-Walpole-Volume15.html The Letters of Horace Walpole, Volume 1 by Horace Walpole Part 15 out of 18 Fullbooks.com 2010-06-21 ] used for political purposes in England. Cumberland&apos;s own brother, the Prince of Wales (who had been refused permission to take a military role on his father&apos;s behalf), seems to have encouraged the virulent attacks upon the Duke. His actions did bring the war to an end almost at once, and most of the populations of Scotland, the rest of Britain, and the colonies lionised him as their deliverer from the Jacobite menace—for instance, he received an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow. [ Encyclop &amp; aelig;dia Britannica http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028181/William-Augustus-duke-of-Cumberland Encyclopædia Britannica Britannica.com 2010-06-21 ] Cumberland preserved the strictest discipline in his camp. He was inflexible in the execution of what he deemed to be his duty, without favour to any man. At the same time, he exercised his influence in favour of clemency in special cases that were brought to his notice. Some years later, James Wolfe spoke of the Duke as &quot; for ever doing noble and generous actions &quot;. The Duke&apos;s victorious efforts were acknowledged by his being voted an income of £25,000 per annum over and above his money from the civil list. { W. A. Speck, &quot; William Augustus, Prince, duke of Cumberland (1721–1765) &quot;, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 16 Oct 2009. } A thanksgiving service was held at St Paul&apos;s Cathedral which saw the first performance of George Frideric Handel &apos;s &quot; The Conquering Hero &quot;, composed especially for Cumberland. { Speck, p. 170. } [ Return to the Continent ] [ Battle of Lauffeld ] The Duke took no part in the Flanders campaign of 1746, during which the French made huge advances capturing Brussels and defeating the Allies at Rocoux. In 1747, Cumberland returned to the Continent and he again opposed the still-victorious Marshal Saxe and received a heavy defeat at the Battle of Lauffeld, or Val, near Maastricht, on 2 July 1747. { Stanhope, p. 334 } This and the fall of Bergen-op-Zoom compelled the two sides to the negotiating table and in 1748 the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was concluded and Cumberland returned home. { Sosin, p.516-535 } [ Peacetime ] Cumberland&apos;s unpopularity, which had steadily increased since Culloden, interfered greatly with his success in politics, and when the death of the Prince of Wales brought the latter&apos;s son, a minor, next in succession to the throne, the Duke was not able to secure for himself the contingent regency. As a compromise, the regency was vested in the Dowager Princess of Wales, who considered him an enemy, but her powers were curtailed and she was to be advised by a committee of twelve men, headed by Cumberland. { Van der Kiste, p. 195 } [ Seven Years&apos; War ] [ Invasion of Hanover (1757) ] [ Great Britain in the Seven Years War ] In 1757, the Seven Years&apos; War having broken out, Cumberland was placed at the head of the Army of Observation, a force of German allies paid for by Britain which intended to defend Hanover from a French attack. { Rolt, p.498 } At the Battle of Hastenbeck, near Hamelin, on 26 July 1757, Cumberland&apos;s army was defeated by the superior forces of d&apos;Estrées. Despite seemingly having the advantage towards the end of the battle, Cumberland&apos;s forces began to retreat. Within a short time discipline had collapsed, and Cumberland&apos;s army headed northwards in total disorder. Cumberland hoped that the Royal Navy might bring him reinforcements and supplies which would allow him to regroup and counterattack, but the British mounted an expedition to Rochefort instead, despite suggestions that it should be sent to aid Cumberland. { Anderson p.177 } By September 1757 Cumberland and his forces had retreated to the fortified town of Stade on the North Sea coast. The King gave him discretionary powers to negotiate a separate peace. { Van der Kiste, p. 205 } Hemmed in by the French, under Richelieu, he agreed to Convention of Klosterzeven, under which Cumberland&apos;s army was to be disbanded and much of Hanover was occupied by french forces, at the Zeven monastery, on 8 September 1757. { Anderson p. 211 } On Cumberland&apos;s return to London he was treated badly by his father despite the fact that he had previously been given permission to negotiate such an agreement. When they met George II remarked &quot; Here is my son who has ruined me and disgraced himself &quot;. { Anderson p. 212; Van der Kiste, p. 206 } In response, Cumberland resigned all the military and public offices he held and retired into private life. { Van der Kiste, p. 207 } { Blanc Coursier Herald, Cumberland&apos;s } { private officer of arms } [ Final Years ] Cumberland&apos;s final years were lived out during the first years of the reign of his nephew, George III, who acceded to the throne on the death of William&apos;s father on 25 October 1760: Cumberland became a very influential advisor to the King and was instrumental in establishing the First Rockingham Ministry. Cabinet meetings were held either at Cumberland Lodge, his home in Windsor, or at Upper Grosvenor Street, his house in London. Cumberland never fully recovered from his wound at Dettingen, and was obese. In August 1760, he suffered a stroke { Van der Kiste, p. 212 } and, on 31 October 1765, he died at Upper Grosvenor Street in London. He was buried beneath the floor of the nave of the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey. { Stanley, p.200 } He died unmarried.
