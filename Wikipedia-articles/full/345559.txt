At the time, before the formation of the Football Association (FA), many different kinds of football were popular in England. For example, each of the various public schools played football according to their own individual rules, and these varied widely. 1890 Sheffield squad shot. The first rules were distinctive. [ Adrian Harvey Football, the First Hundred Years 2005 98 Routledge 0-415-35019-0 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DTxoZ0S-GC7MC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3DFootball%2C%2Bthe%2BFirst%2BHundred%2BYears%26amp%3Bsig%3DzXwMJCXCG3A06tTxi8-gapAd8eo ] There was no offside rule and was the first to introduce free kicks for foul play.

[ http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/sheffield%20fc.htm Hall of Fame – Sheffield FC National Football Museum 2008-05-22 ] By 1862 there were 15 clubs in the Sheffield area. These rules were later adopted by the Sheffield Football Association when it was formed in 1867. By this time the club had decided only to play teams outside Sheffield in order to seek a bigger challenge. They became members of The Football Association in 30 November 1863 but continued to use their own set of rules. [ Young Percy Football in Sheffield S. Paul 20–21 ] [ August 2010 ] On 2 January 1865, the club played its first fixture outside Sheffield against Nottingham, playing eighteen aside under Nottingham Rules. The rest of the season also saw them visit [ Nottingham Forest ] and [ Lincoln City ]. On 31 March 1866, there was a match between a team representing Sheffield and one representing London clubs, at Battersea Park. Rules that differed only slightly from the FA rules were used. The game, played as an eleven aside, was won by London by 2 goals and four touchdowns to nil. However the matter of rules remained a problem with Sheffield continuing to play by their own rules. A number of rule proposals by the club were rejected by the FA in February 1867 and the London Committee were reluctant to commit to further fixtures over Sheffield&apos;s refusal to play strictly to FA rules. Sheffield finally adopted the FA rules in 1878. [ Famous players ] Three players represented England while on the books of Sheffield F.C. – Charles Clegg who played in the first international game against Scotland in 1872, John Owen in 1874 and John Hudson in 1883.

The team operated each season from 1876–77 until 1878–79, winning the Cup in their final year. The side was briefly revived in the early 1880s.

After the legalisation of professionalism Sheffield Club suggested to the FA the creation of a cup exclusively for amateur clubs. This would become the FA Amateur Cup and gave Sheffield their first ever cup success in 1904. [ League history since World War II ] Sheffield joined the Yorkshire League in 1949, remaining in that competition until it merged with the Midland League to form the Northern Counties East League in 1982. During their 33-year stay in the Yorkshire League, their only divisional title was the Division Two crown in 1975–76. After joining the new league, initially in the lower divisions, they twice won the Division One title in 1988–89 and 1990–91, and held Premier Division status continuously from 1991 to 2007. In 2006–07, they finished second in the Premier Division, their highest position ever, and because of the latest round of restructuring of the National League System were accepted into the Northern Premier League Division One for 2007–08.

In the following years they would play at Newhall Athletic ground, Old Forge ground and a ground near Hunters Bar on Ecclesall Road. [ Fred Walters The History of Sheffield Football Club 1957 ] There was much reluctance from the owners of Bramall Lane to see the pitch be used for football. They didn&apos;t relent until a charity match between Sheffield and Hallam was suggested in late 1862. The ground was used by Sheffield F.C. for its more important fixtures but relations with the owners remained strained. They collapsed altogether in 1875 when the club vowed never to play at the ground again. In 1921, Sheffield settled at the new Abbeydale Park ground.
