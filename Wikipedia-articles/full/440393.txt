Midway through the 1997-98 season, Guerin was traded (along with Valeri Zelepukin ) to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Jason Arnott and Bryan Muir.

After a disappointing season in 2005–06 where he notched only 40 points, Dallas decided to buy out the remainder of his contract. The conditions of buyouts in the NHL meant that the Stars would pay him two-thirds of the remaining salary on his contract spread out over twice as many years. This meant $6.7 million over one year became $4.4 million over 2 years. On July 3, 2006, Guerin signed a one-year, $2 million dollar deal with the St Louis Blues.

He was named to the 2007 All-Star game (hosted by the Dallas Stars) to represent the Blues. Despite numerous criticisms of his play during his time as a Star, Guerin received a standing ovation from the Dallas fans in recognition as his status as a long time fan favorite. On February 2, 2007, Guerin became the 214th NHL player to play in 1,000 games.
