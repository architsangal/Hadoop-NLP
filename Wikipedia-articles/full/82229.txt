On 10 January 1863 the Metropolitan Railway opened a line between Paddington and Farringdon. It was the first underground railway in the world. The four-track section between [ Wembley Park ] and [ Moor Park ] allows the running of express or &quot; fast &quot; services to the outer suburbs which can overtake slower stopping trains. The Metropolitan is the only Underground line with this feature; on the others the rule is &quot; all trains call at all stations &quot; (until the train&apos;s destination is reached). The Metropolitan line and the Central line are the only two Underground routes with stations outside the boundaries of Greater London and the M25 orbital motorway. [ History ] Construction of the Metropolitan Railway close to King&apos;s Cross station in 1861 [ Metropolitan Railway (1863-1933) ] [ Metropolitan Railway ] The origins of the Metropolitan line lie with the Metropolitan Railway, the world&apos;s first underground railway, [ http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/keyfacts/13173.aspx#page-link-metropolitan-line-facts Metropolitan Line Facts Transport for London 3 March 2012 ] opening in 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon Street, to connect the relatively remote terminus of Paddington with the City. The route, built by cut-and-cover, was mostly via the then New Road, now Marylebone Road and Euston Road, thereby also connecting the other railway termini to the north of the centre of London, namely Euston and King&apos;s Cross. The service was initially provided by gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. In 1871 plans were presented for a underground railway in Paris called the Métropolitain in imitation of the line in London. [ Benson Bobrick Labyrinths of Iron Newsweek books 1981 142 ] The modern word metro is a short form of the French word Métropolitain. The Metropolitan Railway branched out to the suburbs from Baker Street, reaching Harrow in 1880, and eventually as far as [ Verney Junction ], over [ 50 mi km off ] from Baker Street and the centre of London. The railway started to electrify its routes from 1905. It used electric multiple units on the electrified routes in London, but to serve stations on the unelectrified outer lines coaches would be hauled out of London by an electric locomotive which was changed for a steam locomotive en route. After World War I, the &quot; Metro-land &quot; name promoted the new estates being built near the railway. [ London Transport (1933–88) ] [ Metropolitan line (1933–88) ] On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board. The line was successively rationalised during the following period. The section northwest of [ Aylesbury ] was closed in 1936, though services did return to [ Quainton Road ] between 1943 and 1948. In 1936 the Metropolitan line was extended from [ Whitechapel ] to [ Barking ] along the tracks of the District line. In 1939 the Stanmore branch was transferred to the Bakerloo line. (It was subsequently transferred to the Jubilee line when that line opened in 1979.) Metropolitan line Heraldry Steam-hauled passenger trains ran north of [ Rickmansworth ] until 1961 and maintenance trains until 1972. In September 1961 the London Transport service north of Amersham was withdrawn. Local and semi-fast services from Aylesbury shared the double track with main line expresses of the former Great Central route as far as Harrow-on-the-Hill. Because of the growth of suburban traffic on the Metropolitan, the line north of Harrow-on-the-Hill was quadrupled to Northwood Hills by 1961 and to Croxleyhall Junction (north of Moor Park) by 1962. [ Rebranding (1988-) ] In 1988, the Hammersmith &amp; City and East London lines were rebranded as separate lines. From this date &quot; Metropolitan line &quot; refers only to the route from Aldgate to Baker Street and then northwards, through &quot; Metro-land &quot; to Amersham with a branch to Uxbridge. The East London Line shared stock with the Metropolitan line until its closure in 2007 for conversion into a London Overground line. In 1998, the infrastructure of the Metropolitan line was partly privatised in a public–private partnership. It is now part of the &quot; Sub-Surface Railways &quot; group, managed along with the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and District lines by London Underground Limited, formerly the Metronet consortium.

It is intended that all 58 of the new trains needed for the Metropolitan will be in service by mid 2012. The A Stock trains were built between 1960 and 1962, and initially ran in service with unpainted aluminium bodywork for many years, but when refurbished in the 1990s it received a white and blue Underground livery, with red ends. Services are formed of two four-car units coupled together to make eight-car trains, although the former Chesham shuttle service was served by a four-car train, as was the East London line when it was an Underground route.

The Metropolitan line is the only London Underground line with a recognisable London terminus, at Baker Street (although many trains from north of Baker Street do not terminate there but go on to Aldgate). Also, unlike other lines, the Metropolitan operates a mixture of fast, semi-fast, and all-stations services.

[ http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/jubilee.html CULG Jubilee line Clive Feather ] The line goes well outside Greater London, serving parts of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. As a result it is the only Underground line to serve Travelcard zones 7, 8 and 9. It does not have any stations in Zone 3, making it the only Underground line serving non-contiguous zones. The A Stock is fitted with transverse seating only, luggage racks, and umbrella hooks. The new S Stock that is currently being introduced to replace the A Stock has a mix of transverse and longitudinal seating and as a result has 32 per cent fewer seats. [ http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/AsubsurfaceStock/ A60/62 stock SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk ] The S Stock trains have train-length gangways which allow passengers to move between coaches, like main-line trains. The fast lines north of Harrow, including all the lines north of Rickmansworth, appear to be signalled to Network Rail standards. However, this is not actually the case. Although standard four-aspect Network Rail signal heads are installed, they actually use standard LUL signalling. { British Railway Signalling - G M Kichenside &amp; Alan Williams } The upper two lights are a standard two-aspect LUL stop signal, displaying either a single green or single red aspect. The lower two lights are a standard LUL repeater signal for the next stop signal ahead, showing either a single green or single yellow aspect. The repeater indication is suppressed when the stop signal shows a red aspect. Thus although the signal is really two-signals combined, it nevertheless appears to a train driver as a three-aspect signal. The danger indication is a single red light; the caution indication (that is the next stop signal shows danger) is a yellow light with a green light above it and the clear indication is two green lights. This combination departs from the usual railway standard of having the red light as the lowest light on the signal. The Metropolitan line is the fastest London Underground line, with large sections of track being at [ 50 or 60 mph on ] (previously [ 70 mph on ] ). The normal line speed for an Underground line is [ 40 - 45 mph on ]. A computerised signal control centre operates from Baker Street covering the line to Aldgate while other signalling points on the line are run locally. Unusually for the Underground, a full timetable is published for the Amersham/Chesham to Rickmansworth section. There is also a summary timetable covering the Watford to North Harrow section. [ Current service pattern ] Platform information sign at Moorgate station advising passengers that some Metropolitan line trains do not call at all stations. Over the years the list of stations &quot; non-stopped &quot; has varied, with, for instance, at one time Harrow-On-The-Hill and West Harrow being included in the list. Since 11 December 2011 the off-peak service has been entirely &quot; all-stations &quot; stopping trains, and the &quot; fast &quot; and &quot; semi-fast &quot; trains run only in Monday to Friday peak hours. The current off-peak service pattern is as follows: 4 trains an hour between Uxbridge and Aldgate; 4 trains an hour between Uxbridge and Baker Street; 4 trains an hour between Watford and Baker Street; 2 trains an hour between Amersham and Aldgate; 2 trains an hour between Chesham and Aldgate. This requires 35 trains. The peak-hour service pattern is more complex, with trains running between Aldgate and all the four northern termini. The southbound service in the morning peak is a 32-minute cycle of 12 trains arriving at Baker Street at 2.5- or 3-minute intervals as follows (all-stations trains except where shown otherwise): Amersham to Aldgate (semi-fast); Uxbridge to Baker Street; Amersham to Aldgate (fast); Watford to Baker Street; Watford to Aldgate (semi-fast); Uxbridge to Aldgate; Watford to Baker Street; Uxbridge to Aldgate; Chesham to Aldgate (fast); Uxbridge to Baker Street; Watford to Aldgate (semi-fast); Uxbridge to Baker Street. The northbound service in the afternoon peak is a 32-minute cycle of 12 trains leaving Baker Street as follows: Baker Street to Amersham (semi-fast); Aldgate to Uxbridge; Aldgate to Watford (semi-fast); Baker Street to Watford; Aldgate to Chesham (fast); Aldgate to Uxbridge; Baker Street to Watford (semi-fast); Aldgate to Uxbridge; Aldgate to Watford (semi-fast); Baker Street to Uxbridge; Aldgate to Amersham (fast); Aldgate to Uxbridge. The peak service requires 49 trains Monday to Friday mornings, and 50 in the evening. The first train each morning from Chesham runs direct to Watford via the &quot; north curve &quot; between Rickmansworth and Croxley. Two other early-morning trains run direct from Rickmansworth to Watford. The last train from Watford at night runs direct to Rickmansworth. On 12 December 2010 London Underground reduced the service to Amersham from 4 to 2 trains an hour, and provided a direct service between Chesham and central London every 30 minutes all day. The 4-car Chesham shuttle service was withdrawn. This change was made because the new S Stock trains come in 8-car sets and there will not be any 4-car trains when the A-class rolling stock is withdrawn. There was no change in the frequency between Chalfont &amp; Latimer and Baker Street, apart from late evening and early Sunday mornings, when 2 of the 6 Watford trains per hour were diverted to Chesham.

[ http://www.metroland.org.uk/steamonthemet/index.htm Steam on the Met www.metroland.org.uk ] The event was a great success and so in 1990, London Underground decided to run steam between Harrow and Amersham. In 1992, to celebrate 100 years of the Met at Amersham, the event was extended to 5 days at the end of May. In 1995, it was decided to run trains between Amersham and Watford. [ http://www.offshed.com/mainline/showcategory.php?catID%3D13 Steam on the Met Geoffrey King ] Engines used in the event included BR standard class 4 tank, BR standard class 5, and GWR Pannier tanks. There were also various other rolling stock used as static displays at Rickmansworth sidings. Initially, London Underground hired coaching stock from British Rail for the event, but found that it was actually cheaper to buy coaches instead, thus, LU acquired numerous coaches from BR. The steam trains ran in between normal timetabled Metropolitan and main line services. Due to the imminent part privatisation of LUL and the condition of the coaching stock, the last steam excursion took place in 2000. Since 2007, special trains run on the Met using the electric Sarah Siddons and diesel Class 20 locomotives.

[ Reorganisation ] As part of a wider overhaul of the sub-surface lines, there were plans [ March 2012 ] to run Metropolitan line trains from Uxbridge through Aldgate East to Barking, with the Hammersmith and City line taking the Metropolitan&apos;s old terminus of Aldgate instead. These plans, if implemented, cannot go forward until the Metropolitan line&apos;s stock is totally replaced, as its existing trains are too wide.
