It is a theater commander&apos;s asset to provide a broad overview and systematic target surveillance. For this purpose, the Global Hawk is able to provide high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) —that can penetrate cloud-cover and sandstorms — and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imagery at long range with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (103,600 square kilometers) of terrain a day. It is used as a high-altitude platform for surveillance and security. Missions for the Global Hawk cover the spectrum of intelligence collection capability to support forces in worldwide military operations. According to the Air Force, the capabilities of the aircraft allow more precise targeting of weapons and better protection of forces through superior surveillance capabilities. The Global Hawk costs about US$35 million to procure each aircraft. { &quot; $143M for Global Hawk Cost Overruns &quot;. Defense Industry Daily, 25 April 2005. } With development costs included, the unit cost rises to US$218 million. { &quot; Costly Drone Is Poised to Replace U-2 Spy Plane &quot; New York Times, 2 August 2011. } Initial operational capability was declared for the RQ-4 Block 30 in August 2011. In January 2012, the Air Force announced that no further RQ-4 Block 30 aircraft would be procured, and that the existing fleet would be mothballed to reduce costs. [ Development ] [ Initial development ] The first seven aircraft were built under the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, sponsored by DARPA, in order to evaluate the design and its capabilities. Due to world circumstances, the capabilities of the aircraft were in high demand, so the prototype aircraft were operated by the U.S. Air Force in the War in Afghanistan. { Beale Air Force Base } In an unusual move, the aircraft entered initial low-rate production while still in engineering and manufacturing development. Nine production Block 10 aircraft (sometimes referred to as RQ-4A configuration) were produced, two of which were sold to the US Navy. Two more were sent to Iraq to support operations there. The final Block 10 aircraft was delivered on June 26, 2006. { &quot; Last Block 10 Global Hawk Arrives For Check Flights. &quot; } In order to increase the aircraft&apos;s capabilities, the airframe was redesigned, with the nose section and wings being stretched. The changes, with the designation RQ-4B Block 20, { RQ-4 Global Hawk Printable Fact Sheet, USAF, November 19, 2009. } allow the aircraft to carry up to 3,000 pounds of internal payload. These changes were introduced with the first Block 20 aircraft, the 17th Global Hawk produced, which was rolled out in a ceremony on August 25, 2006. { &quot; Northrop unveils next generation Global Hawk &quot;, Aerotech News and Review, September 1, 2006. } First flight of the Block 20 from the USAF Plant 42 in Palmdale, California to Edwards Air Force Base took place on March 1, 2007. Developmental testing of Block 20 took place in 2008. Future Block 30 and 40 aircraft, similar in size to the Block 20, are scheduled for development from 2008 to 2010. { McGee, Chris, &quot; Global Hawk in demand, passes 10,000 flight hours milestone &quot;, Aerotech News and Review, August 11, 2006. } When the Global Hawk was produced it was in a sale plan for more than 5 countries including USA and Germany. [ Production of prototypes or initial production or what? September 2011 ] [ United States Navy version ] The United States Navy took delivery of two of the Block 10 aircraft to be used to evaluate maritime surveillance capabilities, designated N-1 (BuNo 166509) and N-2 (BuNo 166510). { Northrop Grumman Press Release, June 13, 2005 } The initial example was tested in a naval configuration at Edwards Air Force Base for several months, later ferrying to NAS Patuxent River on March 28, 2006 to begin the Global Hawk Maritime Demonstration (GHMD) program. Navy squadron VX-20 was tasked with operating the GHMD system. { Selinger, M. &quot; U.S. Navy To Receive First Global Hawk Next Week. &quot; } { Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology. October 1, 2004. } { First Unmanned Global Hawk Delivered to U.S. Navy - U.S. Department of Defense Transformation News Story } The GHMD aircraft flew in the Rim of the Pacific ( RIMPAC ) exercise for the first time in July 2006. Although RIMPAC operations were in the vicinity of Hawaii, the aircraft was operated from Edwards, requiring flights of approximately [ 2500 mi km ] each way to the operations area. Four flights were performed, resulting in over 24 hours of persistent maritime surveillance coordinated with USS &apos;&apos;Abraham Lincoln&apos;&apos; and USS &apos;&apos;Bonhomme Richard&apos;&apos;. As a part of the demonstration program, Global Hawk was tasked with maintenance of maritime situational awareness, contact tracking, and imagery support of various exercise operations. The imagery obtained by Global Hawk was transmitted to NAS Patuxent River for processing before being forwarded on to the fleet operations off Hawaii, thus exercising the global nature of this aircraft&apos;s operations. { &quot; Navy Global Hawk Performs in RIMPAC &quot;, Aerotech News and Review, August 18, 2006 } Northrop Grumman entered a version of the RQ-4B in the US Navy&apos;s Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAV contract competition. On 22 April 2008 the announcement was made that the Northrop Grumman RQ-4N had won the bid, with the Navy awarding a contract worth US$1.16 billion. { Navy Awards Northrop Grumman Unmanned Aircraft System Contract } In September 2010, the RQ-4N was officially designated the MQ-4C. { BAMS given MQ-4C designation } [ Cost increases and procurement ] Program development cost overrun s had put the Global Hawk system at risk of cancellation. Per-unit costs in mid-2006 were 25% over baseline estimates, caused by both the need to correct design deficiencies as well as increase the system&apos;s capabilities. This caused some concerns about a possible congressional termination of the program if its national security benefits could not be justified. { Cost overruns put Global Hawk at risk. Flight International, April 18, 2006. } { &quot; Cost overruns put Global Hawk at risk &quot;, SBAC.com } However, in June 2006, the Global Hawk program was restructured. Completion of an operational assessment report by the Air Force was delayed from August 2005 to November 2007 due to manufacturing and development delays. The operational assessment report was released in March 2007 and production of the 54 air vehicles planned has been extended by two years to 2015. { &quot; &quot;. Flight International, 21 November 2006. } In February 2011, the Air Force reduced its planned buy of RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft from 22 to 11 in a cost-cutting move. { Putrich, Gayle. &quot; Northrop: Global Hawk not slowing down even with cuts &quot;. Flight International, 22 February 2011. } The U.S. Defense Department&apos;s Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT &amp; E) found the RQ-4B &quot; not operationally effective &quot; for its mission due to aircraft reliability issues in June 2011. { &quot; Pentagon Says Northrop Drone Isn’t ‘Effective’. &quot; Bloomberg News, 6 June 2011. } In June 2011, the Global Hawk was certified by the Secretary of Defense as critical to national security following a breach of the Nunn-McCurdy Amendment. The Secretary stated that: &quot; The Global Hawk is essential to national security; there are no alternatives to Global Hawk which provide acceptable capability at less cost; Global Hawk costs $220M less per year than the U-2 to operate on a comparable mission; the U-2 cannot simultaneously carry the same sensors as the Global Hawk; and if funding must be reduced, Global Hawk has a higher priority over other programs. &quot; { &quot; Nunn-McCurdy Certification Acquisition Decision Memorandum for the Restructured RQ-4A/B Unmanned Aircraft System Global Hawk. &quot; Memorandum for Secretary of the Air Force, June 14, 2011. } On 26 January 2012, the Pentagon announced plans to end Global Hawk Block 30 procurement as the Block 30 was found to be more expensive to operate than the U-2, and its sensor suite was not as capable as the manned aircraft. { &quot; Defense Budget Priorities and Choices &quot;, p. 11. US DoD, January 2012. } { Clark, Colin. &quot; Air Force To Cut 10,000; Global Hawks Get Warehoused. &quot; Aol Defense, January 27, 2012. } Plans to increase the procurement of the Block 40 variant were also announced.

Defense Update, 29 January 2012. } [ Design ] The RQ-4 is powered by an Allison Rolls-Royce AE3007H turbofan engine with 7,050  lbf (31.4  kN) thrust, and carries a payload of 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms). The main fuselage is standard aluminum, semi-monocoque construction, while the wings are made of lightweight, high-strength composite materials. [ http://www.as.northropgrumman.com/products/ghrq4b/index.html 2010-08-16 RQ-4 Block 20 Global Hawk ] [ Integrated system ] { composites. } The Global Hawk UAV system comprises an air vehicle segment consisting of air vehicles with sensor payloads, avionics, and data links; a ground segment consisting of a Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), and a Mission Control Element (MCE) with embedded ground communications equipment; a support element; and trained personnel. The Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) is provided by Raytheon and consists of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), electro-optical (EO), and infrared (IR) sensors. Either the EO or the IR sensors can operate simultaneously with the SAR. Each of the sensors provides wide area search imagery and a high-resolution spot mode. The SAR has a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) mode, which can provide a text message providing the moving target&apos;s position and velocity. Both SAR and EO/IR imagery are processed onboard the aircraft and transmitted to the MCE as individual frames. The MCE can mosaic these frames into images prior to further dissemination. Navigation is via inertial navigation with integrated Global Positioning System updates. Global Hawk is intended to operate autonomously and &quot; untethered &quot; using a satellite data link (either Ku or UHF) for sending sensor data from the aircraft to the MCE. The common data link can also be used for direct down link of imagery when the UAV is operating within line-of-sight of users with compatible ground stations. The ground segment consists of a Mission Control Element (MCE) and Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), provided by Raytheon. The MCE is used for mission planning, command and control, and image processing and dissemination; an LRE for controlling launch and recovery; and associated ground support equipment. (The LRE provides precision differential global positioning system corrections for navigational accuracy during takeoff and landings, while precision coded GPS supplemented with an inertial navigation system is used during mission execution.) By having separable elements in the ground segment, the MCE and the LRE can operate in geographically separate locations, and the MCE can be deployed with the supported command&apos;s primary exploitation site. Both ground segments are contained in military shelters with external antennas for line-of-sight and satellite communications with the air vehicles. [ Sensor packages ] US Navy Global Hawk with an aerial view of wildfires in Northern California, 2008. The Global Hawk carries the Hughes Integrated Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (HISAR) sensor system. { &quot; Hughes Integrated Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (HISAR) &quot;. Jane&apos;s Information Group } HISAR is a lower-cost derivative of the ASARS-2 package that Hughes developed for the Lockheed U-2. HISAR is also fitted in the US Army&apos;s RC-7B Airborne Reconnaissance Low Multifunction (ARLM) manned surveillance aircraft, and is being sold on the international market. HISAR integrates a SAR - MTI system, along with an optical and an infrared imager. All three sensors are controlled and their outputs filtered by a common processor. The digital sensor data can be transmitted at up to 50 Mbit/s to a ground station in real time, either directly or through a communications satellite link. The SAR - MTI system operates in the X-band and provides a number of operational modes: The wide-area MTI mode can detect moving targets within a radius of 62 miles (100 kilometers). The combined SAR-MTI strip mode provides 20 foot (6 meter) resolution over a swath 23 miles (37 kilometers) wide at ranges from 12.4 to 68 miles (20 to 110 kilometers). The SAR spot mode can provide 6 foot (1.8 meter) resolution over 3.8 square miles (10 square kilometers), as well as provide a sea-surveillance function. The visible and infrared imagers share the same gimballed sensor package, and use common optics, providing a telescopic close-up capability. It can be optionally fitted with an auxiliary SIGINT package. To improve survivability, the Global Hawk is fitted with a Raytheon developed AN/ALR-89 self-protection suite consisting of the AN/AVR-3 Laser Warning System, AN/APR-49 Radar Warning Receiver and a jamming system. An ALE-50 towed decoy also aids in the Global Hawk&apos;s deception of enemy air defenses. { Aerotech News and Review, vol 21, issue 27, August 4, 2006 } { AN/ALQ to AN/ALT - Equipment Listing } In July 2006, the US Air Force began testing segments of the improved Global Hawk Block 30 upgrades in the Benefield Anechoic Facility at Edwards AFB. This version incorporates an extremely sensitive SIGINT processor known as the Advanced Signals Intelligence Payload. In September 2006, testing began on a new specialty radar system, the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program, or MP-RTIP, onboard the Scaled Composites Proteus. Once validated, one Global Hawk will be modified to carry this radar set. Previously, the Air Force was considering a larger variant of the MP-RTIP (known as the Wide-Area Surveillance or WAS sensor) for the cancelled E-10 MC2A testbed or E-8 Joint STARS aircraft. In August 2010, Northrop announced that a new version, Block 40, was about to commence production; it would have a new sensor capabilities, including MP-RTIP radar, emphasising surveillance over reconnaissance. The Block 40 design also has a modified undercarriage.

Operational USAF aircraft are flown by the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, 12th Reconnaissance Squadron at Beale Air Force Base. Global Hawk ATCD prototypes have been used in the War in Afghanistan and in the Iraq War. Since April 2010, they fly the Northern Route, from Beale AFB over Canada to South-East Asia and back, reducing flight time and improving maintenance. While their data-collection capabilities have been praised, the program did lose three prototype aircraft, more than one quarter of the aircraft used in the wars, being lost. The crashes were reported to be due to &quot; technical failures or poor maintenance &quot;, with a failure rate per hour flown over 100 times higher than the F-16 fighters flown in the same wars. The manufacturer stated that it was unfair to compare the failure rates of a mature design to that of a prototype aircraft. Three Global Hawks have been lost in accidents through 2003. { Global Hawk Crashes: Who’s to Blame?. May 2003. } { Global Hawk crash unlikely to hurt program.
