[ 1 00 01.0.00009 ] In cell biology, an organelle ( [ icon ɔr ɡ ə ˈ n ɛ l ] ) is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function, and is usually separately enclosed within its own lipid bilayer. The name organelle comes from the idea that these structures are to cells what an organ is to the body (hence the name organelle, the suffix -elle being a diminutive ). Organelles are identified by microscopy, and can also be purified by cell fractionation.There are many types of organelles, particularly in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryote s were once thought not to have organelles, but some examples have now been identified.

Credited as the first [ Bütschli O. Otto Bütschli Dr. H. G. Bronn&apos;s Klassen u. Ordnungen des Thier-Reichs wissenschaftlich dargestellt in Wort und Bild. Erster Band. Protozoa.

Functionally-differentiated multicellular aggregates in multicellular forms or metazoa are in this sense organs, while, for functionally-differentiated portions of unicellular organisms or for such differentiated portions of the unicellular germ-elements of metazoa, the diminutive organula is appropriate.“ Cited after : Oxford English Dictionary online, entry for „organelle“. } { &apos;Journal de l&apos;anatomie et de la physiologie normales et pathologiques de l&apos;homme et des animaux&apos; at Google Books } to use a diminutive of organ (i.e. little organ) for cellular structures was German zoologist Karl August Möbius (1884), who used the term &quot; organula &quot; [ Möbius K.

From the context, it is clear that he referred to reproduction related structures of protist s. In a footnote, which was published as a correction in the next issue of the journal, he justified his suggestion to call organs of unicellular organisms &quot; organella &quot; since they are only differently formed parts of one cell, in contrast to multicellular organs of multicellular organisms. Thus, the original definition was limited to structures of unicellular organisms. It would take several years before organulum, or the later term organelle, became accepted and expanded in meaning to include subcellular structures in multicellular organisms.

Zweite Auflage des Lehrbuchs &quot; Die Zelle und die Gewebe &quot; 1906 Verlag von Gustav Fischer Jena ] still referred to cellular organs.Later, both terms came to be used side by side: Bengt Lidforss wrote 1915 (in German) about &quot; Organs or Organells &quot;.

Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. eds. S.Draggan and C.Cleveland. Washington DC (e.g. in plants, algae,and some protists). Other organelles are also suggested to have endosymbiotic origins, but do not contain their own DNA (notably the flagellum - see evolution of flagella ). Under the more restricted definition of membrane-bound structures, some parts of the cell do not qualify as organelles. Nevertheless, the use of organelle to refer to non-membrane bound structures such as ribosomes is common. { Campbell and Reece, Biology6th edition, Benjamin Cummings, 2002 } This has led some texts to delineate between membrane-bound and non-membrane bound organelles. { Cormack, Introduction to Histology, Lippincott, 1984 } These structures are large assemblies of macromolecule s that carry out particular and specialized functions, but they lack membrane boundaries. Such cell structures include: ribosome cytoskeleton flagellum centriole and microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) proteasome. [ Eukaryotic organelles ] Eukaryotes are one of the structurally complex cell type, and by definition are in part organized by smaller interior compartments, that are themselves enclosed by lipid membranes that resemble the outermost cell membrane. The larger organelles, such as the nucleus and vacuoles, are easily visible with the light microscope. They were among the first biological discoveries made after the invention of the microscope. Not all eukaryotic cells have each of the organelles listed below. Exceptional organisms have cells which do not include some organelles that might otherwise be considered universal to eukaryotes (such as mitochondria). [ Fahey RC, Newton GL, Arrack B, Overdank-Bogart T, Baley S Entamoeba histolytica: a eukaryote without glutathione metabolism Science 224 4644 70–72 1984 6322306 10.1126/science.6322306 1984Sci...224...70F ] There are also occasional exceptions to the number of membranes surrounding organelles, listed in the tables below (e.g., some that are listed as double-membrane are sometimes found with single or triple membranes). In addition, the number of individual organelles of each type found in a given cell varies depending upon the function of that cell.

In the past, they were often viewed as having little internal organization; but, slowly, details are emerging about prokaryotic internal structures. An early false turn was the idea developed in the 1970s that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosome s, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy.
