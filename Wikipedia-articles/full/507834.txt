From roughly 1998 to 2001, he was widely considered to be the heir-apparent to his father and the next leader of North Korea. Following a much-publicized botched attempt to secretly enter Japan using a fake passport and visit Disneyland in May 2001, he was thought to have fallen out of favor with his father. { Huffington Post article: &quot; Kim Jong Nam, North Korean Leader&apos;s Son, Denies Plans To Defect. &quot; } Kim Jong-nam&apos;s younger paternal half-brother Kim Jong-un was named heir apparent in September 2010. { Christian Science Monitor article: &quot; Kim Jong-un confirmed North Korean heir ahead of massive military parade. &quot; } In exile, Jong-nam has become known as a sometime critic of his family&apos;s regime and an advocate for reform.

Because Kim Jong-il aimed to keep his affair with Song a secret due to the disapproval of his father Kim Il-sung, he initially kept Jong-nam out of school, instead sending him to live with Song&apos;s older sister Song Hye-rang, who tutored him at home.

Martin, pp. 697. &quot; } The same aunt also said in 2000 that Jong-nam &quot; does not wish to succeed his father. &quot; Like Kim Jong-il, he is interested in film : he has written scripts and short films since he was young. His father also created a small movie set for him to use. According to the Japanese magazine Shukan Shincho, Kim Jong-nam has made several clandestine visits to Japan, starting as early as 1995. A book about the Kim family, Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader by Bradley K. Martin, reported that during the late 1990s, Kim Jong-nam became &quot; a familiar figure &quot; at a bathhouse in Yoshiwara, one of Tokyo &apos;s red light districts. [ 1998–2001: Time as heir apparent ] In 1998 Kim Jong-nam was appointed to a senior position in the Ministry of Public Security, the DPRK security apparatus, indicating that he was being promoted as a future leader. He was also reported to have been appointed head of the DPRK Computer Committee, in charge of developing an information technology industry. In January 2001 he accompanied his father to Shanghai, where he had talks with Chinese officials on the IT industry. [ 2001 Tokyo Disneyland incident ] In May 2001, Kim Jong-nam was arrested on arrival at New Tokyo International Airport (now Narita International Airport ), accompanied by two women and a four-year old boy identified as his son. He was traveling on a forged Dominican Republic passport using a Chinese alias, Pang Xiong, { &quot; 金正日夫人去世使继承人问题又增悬疑 &quot;.

Retrieved on 28 October 2008. } Kim Jong-nam was reportedly wearing a white shirt and dark blazer along with sunglasses and a gold chain. After being detained for several days, he was deported, on the instructions of the Japanese government, to the People&apos;s Republic of China. Kim Jong-nam apparently told his questioners that he was in Japan to visit Tokyo Disneyland in Urayasu, also near Tokyo. The incident caused Kim Jong-il to cancel a planned visit to China because of the embarrassment to both countries. [ 2001–2005: Loss of favour ] Until the Tokyo incident, Kim Jong-nam was expected to become leader of the country after his father. In February 2003, the DPRK People&apos;s Army began a propaganda campaign under the slogan &quot; The Respected Mother is the Most Faithful and Loyal Subject to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander. &quot; Since the &quot; Respected Mother &quot; was described as &quot; [devoting] herself to the personal safety of the comrade supreme commander, &quot; and &quot; [assisting] the comrade supreme commander nearest to his body, &quot; it is assumed that the &quot; Respected Mother &quot; is Ko Young-hee, and that the campaign was designed to promote Kim Jong-chul or Kim Jong-un, her sons. (A similar campaign was launched in praise of Kim Jong Il&apos;s mother during the later years of Kim Il-Sung&apos;s life.) It is believed that Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-nam′s youngest half-brother, became the new heir apparent due to this incident. [ Choe Sang-Hun Succession May Be Behind N. Korea’s New Belligerence http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/world/asia/28north.html?ref%3Dglobal-home The New York Times 27 May 2010 ] Since the loyalty of the Army is the real foundation of the Kim family&apos;s continuing hold on power in the DPRK, this was a serious development for Kim Jong-nam&apos;s prospects. In late 2003 it was reported that Kim Jong-nam was living in Macau, lending strength to this belief. In 2003, Hwang Jang-yop, a former KWP secretary for international affairs who defected to South Korea in 1997, predicted that Kim Jong-nam had lost his chance: &quot; An heir must be the child of a woman a king loves, and it is true that Kim Jong-il loves Koh Young-hee most. The fate of Kim Jong-nam is sealed. &quot; Kim Jong-un was left in charge while his father was on a state visit to China. Outsider observers also believe that the North Korea′s sinking of a South Korean ship in March 2010 was part of a Byzantine attempt to secure succession for the youngest Kim. Kim Jong-nam says he fell out of favour because he had become an advocate for reform after being educated in Switzerland leading his father to decide that he had turned &quot; into a capitalist &quot;. In an email to the editor of Tokyo Shimbun, Kim wrote &quot; After I went back to North Korea following my education in Switzerland, I grew further apart from my father because I insisted on reform and market-opening and was eventually viewed with suspicion, &quot; adding &quot; My father felt very lonely after sending me to study abroad. Then my half brothers Jong-chol and Jong-un and half sister Yeo-jong were born and his adoration was moved on to them. And when he felt that I&apos;d turn into a capitalist after living abroad for years, he shortened the overseas education of my brothers and sister. &quot; [ Kim Jong-nam Says N.Korean Regime Won&apos;t Last Long http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/01/17/2012011701790.html January 17, 2012 Chosun Ilbo (English Edition) January 17, 2012 ] [ 2005–2010: Rise of Kim Jong-un ] [ section May 2009 ] It was reported in the South China Morning Post on February 1, 2007, that Kim Jong-nam had been living incognito with his family in Macau, for some three years, and that this was a cause of some embarrassment to both the Macau and Chinese governments. [ May 2009 ] South Korean television and the South China Morning Post reported in 2007 that Kim Jong-nam had a Portuguese passport. However, Portuguese authorities and the Portuguese consul in Macau, { &quot; Filho de Kim Jong-il com passaporte português &quot; (1 February 2007). Retrieved on 22 September 2010. } Pedro Moitinho de Almeida, stated that &quot; If such a document indeed exists, it is certainly a forgery &quot;. In August 2007 it was reported that Kim Jong-nam had returned to the DPRK from Macau and had begun working at a key agency of the ruling Workers&apos; Party, fueling speculation that the rift between Kim Jong-nam and his father had at least partially mended and that Kim Jong-nam was being groomed as a potential successor. { &quot; Exiled son &apos;returns to N Korea&apos; &quot; (27 August 2007). Retrieved on 28 October 2008. } It was verified later on that this was a rumour and that Kim Jong-nam is still staying in Beijing and Macau as before while travelling to Austria and France for medical reasons early November 2007 where he gave a short interview to a Japanese TV channel after going to Moscow. In January 2009, Kim Jong-nam said he had &quot; no interest &quot; in taking power in North Korea after his father, stating that it is only for him to decide. { Report: Kim&apos;s son hints no decision on successor, AP, January 23, 2009. } In June 2010, Kim Jong-nam gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Macau while waiting for a hotel elevator. { Seattle Times article: &quot; NKorean leader&apos;s son gives interview. &quot; } He told the reporter that he had &quot; no plans &quot; to defect to Europe, as the press had recently rumoured. Kim Jong-nam lived in an apartment on the southern tip of Macau&apos;s Coloane Island until 2007. An anonymous South Korean official reported in October 2010 that Jong-nam had not lived in Macau for &quot; months &quot;, and now shuttles between China and &quot; another country. &quot; In late September 2010, his younger half-brother Kim Jong-un was made heir-apparent. { Kim Jong-il&apos;s grandson seen at concert, } { RTHK, 18 July 2009 } { North Koreans Bloster power of Ruler&apos;s Kin, by Marin Frackler and Mark McDonald, New York Times 29 September 2010 } Kim Jong-un was declared Supreme Leader of North Korea on December 24, 2011 after the death of Kim Jong-il. On January 1, 2012 the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Kim Jong-Nam secretly flew to Pyongyang from Macau on December 17, 2011, after learning about his father&apos;s death that day and is presumed to have accompanied Kim Jong-Un when paying his last respects to their father. He left after a few days to return to Macau and was not in attendance at the funeral in order to avoid speculation about the succession. { Kim&apos;s eldest in &apos;secret visit&apos; to see body (AFP, January 1, 2012) } On January 14, 2012 Kim Jong-nam was seen in Beijing waiting for an Air China flight to Macau.
