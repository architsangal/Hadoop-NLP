[ Treasurer of the United States ] [ Secretary of the Treasury (disambiguation) ] [ United States Secretary the Treasury US-DeptOfTheTreasury-Seal.svg 100px Official Seal Timothy Geithner official portrait.jpg Timothy Geithner January 26, 2009 Alexander Hamilton September 11, 1789 Fifth ] The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is the head of the United States Department of the Treasury, which is concerned with financial and monetary matters, and, until 2003, also with some issues of national security and defense. This position in the Federal Government of the United States is analogous to the Minister of Finance in many other countries. Most of the Department&apos;s law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Customs Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the U.S. Secret Service were reassigned to other Departments in 2003 in conjunction with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The Secretary of the Treasury is a member of the President&apos;s Cabinet, and since the Clinton Administration, has been a member of the U.S. National Security Council. By law and by tradition, the Secretary of the Treasury is fifth in the United States presidential line of succession, in case of some extreme calamity in the United States. From the U.S. Department of the Treasury website : &quot; The Secretary of the Treasury is the principal economic advisor to the President and plays a critical role in policy-making by bringing an economic and government financial policy perspective to issues facing the government. The Secretary is responsible for formulating and recommending domestic and international financial, economic, and tax policy, participating in the formulation of broad fiscal policies that have general significance for the economy, and managing the public debt. The Secretary oversees the activities of the Department in carrying out its major law enforcement responsibilities; in serving as the financial agent for the United States Government; and in manufacturing coins and currency. &quot; The Chief Financial Officer of the government, the Secretary serves as Chairman Pro Tempore of the President&apos;s Economic Policy Council, Chairman of the Boards and Managing Trustee of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, and as U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. &quot; The Secretary along with the Treasurer must sign Federal Reserve notes before they can become legal tender. [ March 2009 ] The Secretary also manages the United States Emergency Economic Stabilization fund. The current Secretary of the Treasury is Timothy Geithner. The Secretary of the Treasury earns $191,300 per year. [ Secretaries of the Treasury ] { Peale portrait of Robert Morris } Robert Morris was the first person appointed Secretary of the Treasury by George Washington, but Morris declined this office; thus the first Secretary of the Treasury was Alexander Hamilton, who was appointed at Morris&apos;s suggestion. Morris had held a similar position as Superintendent of Finance under the Continental Congress. From 1784 to 1789, the confederation&apos;s finances were overseen by a three-member Treasury Board. { http://www.ustreas.gov/education/history/brochure/history.shtml } Parties [ #EEEEEE No party 1px solid #AAAAAA ] { Federalist } { 1px solid #AAAAAA } { Democratic-Republican } { 1px solid #AAAAAA } { Democratic } { 1px solid #AAAAAA } { Whig } { 1px solid #AAAAAA } { Republican } { 1px solid #AAAAAA } Status [ #E6E6AA Denotes acting Secretary of the Treasury black ] [ white 1 ] [ white 2 ] [ white 3 ] [ white 4 ] [ white 5 ] [ white 6 ] [ 1 1 1 ] [ white 7 ] [ white 8 ] [ white 9 ] [ white 10 ] [ white 11 ] [ white 12 ] [ white 13 ] [ white 17 ] [ white 18 ] [ white 21 ] [ white 22 ] [ white 23 ] [ white 24 ] [ white 25 ] [ white 26 ] [ white 27 ] [ white 28 ] [ white 29 ] [ white 30 ] [ white 31 ] [ white 32 ] [ white 33 ] [ white 34 ] [ white 35 ] [ white 36 ] [ white 37 ] [ white 38 ] [ white 39 ] [ white 40 ] [ white 41 ] [ white 42 ] [ white 43 ] [ white 44 ] [ white 45 ] [ white 46 ] [ white 47 ] [ white 48 ] [ white 49 ] [ white 50 ] [ white 51 ] [ white 52 ] [ white 53 ] [ white 54 ] [ white 55 ] [ white 56 ] [ white 57 ] [ white 58 ] [ white 59 ] [ white 60 ] [ white 61 ] [ white 62 ] [ white 63 ] [ white 64 ] [ white 65 ] [ white 66 ] [ white 67 ] [ 2 2 2 ] [ white 68 ] [ white 69 ] [ 3 3 3 ] [ white 70 ] [ white 71 ] [ white 72 ] [ 4 4 4 ] [ white 73 ] [ 5 5 5 ] [ white 74 ] [ 6 6 6 ] No. Portrait Name State of Residence Took Office Left Office President(s) style= &quot; background:; &quot; | 75px Alexander Hamilton New York September 11, 1789 January 31, 1795 rowspan= &quot; 2 &quot; style= &quot; background:; &quot; | George Washington rowspan= &quot; 2 &quot; style= &quot; background:; &quot; | 75px Oliver Wolcott, Jr. Connecticut February 3, 1795 December 31, 1800 rowspan= &quot; 2 &quot; style= &quot; background:; &quot; | John Adams rowspan= &quot; 2 &quot; style= &quot; background:; &quot; | 75px Samuel Dexter Massachusetts January 1, 1801 May 13, 1801 rowspan= &quot; 2 &quot; style= &quot; background:; &quot; | Thomas Jefferson rowspan= &quot; 2 &quot; style= &quot; background:; &quot; | 75px Albert Gallatin Pennsylvania May 14, 1801 February 8, 1814 rowspan= &quot; 5 &quot; style= &quot; background:; &quot; | James Madison style= &quot; background:; &quot; | 75px George W.
