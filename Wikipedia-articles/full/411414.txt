[ July 2010 ] Location of the crater in North America [ 37 17 N 76 1 W region:US-VA_type:landmark_scale:300000 inline,title ] [ Chesapeake 2008-12-30 ] { confirmed } { 85 km (53 mi) } { 1.3 km (0.81 mi) } { 35 million years } { Yes } { United States } { Virginia } The Chesapeake Bay impact crater was formed by a bolide that impact ed the eastern shore of North America about 35 million years ago, in the late Eocene epoch. It is one of the best-preserved &quot; wet-target &quot; or marine impact craters, and the largest known impact crater in the U.S. Continued slumping of sediment s over the rubble of the crater has helped shape Chesapeake Bay. [ Formation and aftermath ] During the warm, late Eocene, sea level s were high, and the Tidewater region of Virginia lay in the coast al shallows. The shore of eastern North America, about where Richmond, Virginia is today, was covered with dense tropical rainforest, and the waters of the gently sloping continental shelf were rich with marine life that was depositing dense layers of lime from their microscopic shells. Boundaries of the crater The bolide impacted at a speed in excess of 11 kilometers per second (Earth escape velocity), punching a deep hole through the sediments and into the granite continental basement rock. The bolide itself was completely vaporised, with the basement rock being fractured to depths of [ 8 km on ], and a peak ring being raised around it. The deep crater, [ 38 km on ] across, is surrounded by a flat-floored terrace-like ring trough with an outer edge of collapsed blocks forming ring faults. The entire circular crater is about [ 85 km on ] in diameter and [ 1.3 km on ] deep, an area twice the size of Rhode Island, and nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon. Numerical modeling techniques by Collins, et al. indicate that the post-impact diameter was likely to have been [ 40 km on ], rather than the observed [ 85 km on ].

Insight from numerical modeling Collins Gareth, et al. 10.1130/G21854.1 Wünnemann Kai ] The surrounding region suffered massive devastation. USGS scientist David Powars, one of the impact crater&apos;s discoverers, has described the immediate aftermath: &quot; Within minutes, millions of tons of water, sediment, and shattered rock were cast high into the atmosphere for hundreds of miles along the East Coast. &quot; An enormous seismic tsunami engulfed the land and possibly even overtopped the Blue Ridge Mountains. The sedimentary walls of the crater progressively slumped in, widened the crater, and formed a layer of huge blocks on the floor of the ring-like trough. The slump blocks were then covered with the rubble or breccia. The entire bolide event, from initial impact to the termination of breccia deposition lasted only a few hours or days. In the perspective of geological time, the [ 1.2 km on ] breccia is an instantaneous deposit. The crater was then buried by additional sedimentary beds that have accumulated during the 35 million years following the impact. Another, smaller bolide impact site, the Toms Canyon impact crater, lies about [ 322 km on ] to the northeast, on the continental shelf off the coast of New Jersey. Having also been dated to the late Eocene, it is possible that this crater may have been formed in the same impact event as the Chesapeake Bay crater. [ Discovery ] Profile view of the crater Until 1983, no one suspected the existence of a large impact crater buried beneath the lower part of the Chesapeake Bay and its surrounding peninsula s. The first hint was a [ 20 cm 0 on ] thick layer of ejecta that turned up in a drilling core taken off Atlantic City, New Jersey, far to the north. The layer contained the fused glass beads called tektite s and shocked quartz grains that are unmistakable signs of a bolide impact. In 1993, oil exploration revealed the extent of the crater. [ April 2011 ] [ Effects on local rivers ] The continual slump ing of the rubble within the crater has affected the flow of the river s and shaped the Chesapeake Bay. The impact crater created a long-lasting topographic depression, which helped predetermine the course of local rivers and the eventual location of Chesapeake Bay. Most important for present-day inhabitants of the area, the impact disrupted aquifer s. The present freshwater aquifers lie above a deep salty brine, making the entire lower Chesapeake Bay area susceptible to groundwater contamination. The crater is also one of three factors contributing to the sinking of land near the Chesapeake Bay. For example, Hampton Roads is gradually sinking at a rate between 15 and 23 centimeters (5 and 7.5  inches) per century. This is occurring because of the slippage of the coast into the crater, “isostatic rebound” of the crust of the earth from the weight of long absent glaciers, and groundwater removal. { Koch, James V. &quot; Costs of Defending Against Rising Sea Levels and Flooding in Mid-Atlantic Metropolitan Coastal Areas: The Basic Issues &quot; JRAP 40(1): 53-60. © 2010 MCRSA.http://www.jamesvkoch.com/uploads/koch40_1_pdf.pdf } [ See also ] Silverpit crater Popigai crater of similar age Grande Coupure [ References ] Poag, C.
