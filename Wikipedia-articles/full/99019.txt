[ Youth and stage career ] Harrison was born in Huyton, Lancashire, { Derry House, Huyton: Aaronson, Charles S, ed. 1969 International Television Almanac, Quigley Publications, New York, USA } and educated at Liverpool College. [ http://www.filmreference.com/Actors-and-Actresses-Ha-Hu/Harrison-Sir-Rex.html (Sir) Rex Harrison filmreference.com ] After a bout of childhood measles, Harrison lost most of the sight in his left eye, which on one occasion caused some on-stage difficulty. [ Harrison Rex Rex: An Autobiography William Morrow 1975 16, 122 http://books.google.com/?id%3DtOAKAAAAMAAJ%26amp%3Bdq%3Drex%2Bharrison%2Bblind%26amp%3Bq%3Dblind 0-688-02881-0 ] He first appeared on the stage in 1924 in Liverpool.

He acted in the West End of London when he was young, appearing in the Terence Rattigan play French Without Tears, which proved to be his breakthrough role. He alternated appearances in London and New York in such plays as Bell, Book and Candle (1950), Venus Observed, The Cocktail Party, The Kingfisher, and The Love of Four Colonels, which he also directed. [ http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id%3D2208 The Love of Four Colonels ibdb.com 2009-10-01 ] He won his first Tony Award for his appearance as Henry VIII in Anne of the Thousand Days and international superstardom (and a second Tony Award ) for his portrayal of Henry Higgins in the musical My Fair Lady, in which he appeared opposite Julie Andrews. Later appearances included Pirandello &apos;s Henry IV, a 1984 appearance at the Haymarket Theatre with Claudette Colbert in Frederick Lonsdale &apos;s Aren&apos;t We All?, and one on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre presented by Douglas Urbanski, at the Haymarket in J. M. Barrie &apos;s The Admirable Crichton with Edward Fox. He returned as Henry Higgins in a highly paid revival of My Fair Lady directed by Patrick Garland in 1981, cementing his association with the plays of George Bernard Shaw which included a Tony nominated performance as Shotover in Heartbreak House, Julius Caesar in Caesar and Cleopatra, and General Burgoyne in a Los Angeles production of The Devil&apos;s Disciple. [ In film ] Harrison&apos;s film debut was in The Great Game (1930), and other notable early films include The Citadel (1938), Night Train to Munich (1940), Major Barbara (1941), Blithe Spirit (1945), Anna and the King of Siam (1946), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), and The Foxes of Harrow (1947).

He also starred in 1967&apos;s Doctor Dolittle. At the height of his box office clout after the success of My Fair Lady, Harrison proved a domineering and demanding irritant for the cast and crew during production, demanding impractical things like needless auditions for prospective composers after musical playwright Leslie Bricusse was contracted [ Harris Mark Pictures at a Revolution 2008 The Penguin Press 131 ] and demanding to have his singing recorded live during shooting, only to agree to have it rerecorded in post-production. { Ibid, p. 155 } He also disrupted production with drunken incidents with his wife, Rachel Roberts { Ibid, p. 243 } and deliberate misbehavior, such as when he deliberately moved his yacht in front of cameras during shooting in St. Lucia and refused to move it out of sight. { Ibid, p. 242 } Harrison was at one point temporarily replaced by Christopher Plummer, until he agreed to be more cooperative. { Ibid, p. 133-134 } Harrison was not by general terms a singer, and the music was usually written to allow for long periods of recitative, or &quot; speaking to the music. &quot; As result, he refused to be overshadowed by singing co-stars and demanded that Sammy Davis Jr. be replaced by Sidney Poitier for Doctor Dolittle, since the latter actor did not sing professionally { Ibid, p. 127-128 } and continually abused Jewish musical co-stars like Anthony Newley with anti-semitic insults. { Ibid, p. 242 } Nevertheless, &quot; Talk to the Animals &quot;, which Harrison performed in Doctor Dolittle, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1967. His son, Noel, coincidentally sang the 1968 Oscar winner, &quot; The Windmills of Your Mind &quot;.
