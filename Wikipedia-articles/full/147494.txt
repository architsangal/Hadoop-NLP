[ premature ejaculation ] Pre-ejaculate on the glans of a human penis Pre-ejaculate (also known as pre-ejaculatory fluid, preseminal fluid, or Cowper&apos;s fluid, and colloquially as pre-cum) is the clear, colorless, viscous fluid that emits from the urethra of a man&apos;s penis when he is sexually aroused. It is similar in composition to semen, but has some significant chemical differences. The presence of sperm in the fluid is debated. Existing research has found none or low levels of sperm in pre-ejaculate, though these existing studies are non-generalizable due to examining small numbers of men. [ Clark, S. Sep 1981 An examination of the sperm content of human pre-ejaculatory fluid [Unpublished] http://www.popline.org/docs/0813/041933.html ] [ March 2011 ] A contrary, yet non-generalizable study found mixed evidence, and individual cases of a high sperm concentration have been recently published. [ Killick SR, Leary C, Trussell J, Guthrie KA. 10.3109/14647273.2010.520798 2011 Sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid Human Fertility 14 1 48–52 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/14647273.2010.520798 21155689 ] Pre-ejaculate is believed to function as a lubricant and an acid neutralizer. The amount of pre-ejaculate emitted varies widely between individual men. There are some rare cases where men do not pre-ejaculate. [ Origin and composition ] The fluid is discharged during arousal, masturbation, foreplay or at an early stage during sex, some time before the man fully reaches orgasm and semen is ejaculated. It is primarily produced by the bulbourethral gland s (Cowper&apos;s glands), with the glands of Littre (the mucus-secreting urethral glands ) also contributing. [ Chudnovsky, A. Niederberger, C.S. 2007 Copious Pre-Ejaculation: Small Glands--Major Headaches Journal of Andrology 17251594 28 3 374–5 10.2164/jandrol.107.002576 ] {, which cites: } [ Chughtai B, Sawas A, O&apos;Malley RL, Naik RR, Ali Khan S, Pentyala S A neglected gland: a review of Cowper&apos;s gland Int. J. Androl. 28 2 74–7 2005 April 15811067 10.1111/j.1365-2605.2005.00499.x ] The amount of fluid that the human male issues varies widely among individuals. Some men do not produce any pre-ejaculate fluid, [ Vazquez E Is it safe to suck? Posit Aware 8 4 15 1997 11364482 ] while others emit as much as 5   ml. Pre-ejaculate contains some chemicals associated with semen, such as acid phosphatase. Some semen markers, such as gamma-glutamyltransferase, are completely absent from pre-ejaculate fluid. [ Gohara WF Rate of decrease of glutamyltransferase and acid phosphatase activities in the human vagina after coitus Clin. Chem. 26 2 254–7 1980 February 6101549 http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D6101549 ] [ Function ] Acidic environments are hostile to sperm. Pre-ejaculate neutralizes residual acidity in the urethra caused by urine, creating a more favorable environment for the passage of sperm. The vagina is normally acidic, so the deposit of pre-ejaculate before the emission of semen may change the vaginal environment to promote sperm survival. Pre-ejaculate also acts as a lubricant during sexual activity, and plays a role in semen coagulation. { Chudnovsky, A. and C.S. Niederberger (2007), which cites: } [ Beil, R.E. Hart, R.G. 1973 Cowper&apos;s gland secretion in rat semen coagulation. II. Identification of the potentiating factor secreted by the coagulating glands Biol Reprod 8 5 613–7 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4713168 2008-07-12 4713168 ] Men who do not produce any noticeable amount of pre-ejaculate past that used to lubricate the urethra are often benefited by actively exercising the pubococcygeus muscle, releasing seminal fluid before the orgasm occurs in full. [ September 2011 ] [ Risks ] Studies have demonstrated the presence of HIV in most pre-ejaculate samples from infected men. [ 10.1016/0140-6736(92)92659-4 Pudney, J., Oneta, M., Mayer, K., Seage, G., Anderson, D. Pre-ejaculatory fluid as potential vector for sexual transmission of HIV-1 Lancet 1992 340 1470 1360584 8833 ] [ 10.1016/0140-6736(92)92658-3 Ilaria, G., Jacobs, J.L., Polsky, B., et al. Detection of HIV-1 DNA sequences in pre-ejaculatory fluid Lancet 1992 340 8833 1469 1360583 ] Infection with HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Popular belief--dating back to a 1966 Masters &amp; Johnson study [ Masters W.H. Johnson, V.E. 1966 Little, Brown and Company Boston, MA 211 ] --states that pre-ejaculate may contain sperm that can cause pregnancy, which is a common basis of argument against the use of coitus interruptus (withdrawal) as a contraceptive method. However, some studies have found that withdrawal could be almost as effective as condoms in preventing pregnancy. [ 10.1016/j.contraception.2008.12.008 Jones, R.K., Fennell, J., Higgins, J.A. and Blanchard, K. 2009 Better than nothing or savvy risk-reduction practice? The importance of withdrawal Contraception 79 6 407–410 http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/reprints/Contraception79-407-410.pdf 19442773 ] There have been several small-scale studies (sample sizes ranging from 4 to 23 ) that conclude no sperm is present, and thus, pre-ejaculate is ineffectual at causing pregnancy. [ Researchers find no sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid Contraceptive Technology Update October 1993 14 10 12286905 154–156 ] [ Zukerman Z.; Weiss D.B.; Orvieto R. Short Communication: Does Preejaculatory Penile Secretion Originating from Cowper&apos;s Gland Contain Sperm? Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics April 2003 20 4 12762415 157–159 10.1023/A:1022933320700 ] [ Free M, Alexander N Male contraception without prescription. A reevaluation of the condom and coitus interruptus Public Health Rep 91 5 437–45 1976 824668 1440560 ] A noted limitation to these previous studies&apos; findings is that pre-ejaculate samples were analyzed after the critical two-minute point. That is, looking for motile sperm in small amounts of pre-ejaculate via microscope after two minutes--when the sample has most likely dried--makes examination and evaluation &quot; extremely difficult. &quot; Thus, in March 2011 a team of researchers assembled 27 male volunteers and analyzed their pre-ejaculate samples within two minutes after producing them. The researchers found that 11 of the 27 men (41%) produced pre-ejaculatory samples that contained sperm, and 10 of these samples (37%) contained a &quot; fair amount &quot; of motile sperm (i.e. as little as 1 million to as many as 35 million). As a point of reference, a semen sample containing at least 23 million sperm caused pregnancies in 2.5% of a study&apos;s sample within one year. [ Cooper T.G. Noonan, E., von Eckaedstein, S., Auger, J., Baker, H.W.G., Behre, H.M., et al. World Health Organisation reference values for human semen characteristics Human Reproduction Update 2010 16 231–245 10.1093/humupd/dmp048 19934213 3 ] Thus, even if a pre-ejaculate sample contained many millions of sperm, the odds of causing pregnancy are low. It is widely believed that urinating after an ejaculation will flush the urethra of remaining sperm. [ Withdrawal Method Planned Parenthood March 2004 http://www.plannedparenthood.com/health-topics/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method-4218.htm 2006-09-01 ] It must be noted, therefore, that some of the subjects in the March 2011 study who produced sperm in their pre-ejaculate did urinate (sometimes more than once) before producing their sample. However, two things need to be kept in mind. First, the study suggests that some men can leak sperm into their pre-ejaculate (though the authors do not extrapolate on this supposition and the possible causes of such a phenomenon). Second, and most importantly, the authors admit that some of their subjects who submitted sperm-positive pre-ejaculate samples could have actually used their ejaculate--due to failure of producing pre-ejaculate--to avoid the &quot; embarrassment &quot; of not producing pre-ejaculate. [ Overproduction ] In rare cases, a man may produce an excessive amount of pre-ejaculate fluid that can be a cause of embarrassment or irritation. A few case reports have indicated satisfactory results when such men are treated with a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. { Chudnovsky, A. and C.S. Niederberger (2007) } In such cases, one doctor recommended considering the differential diagnosis of prostatorrhea, the emission of prostatic secretions during straining associated with urination or defecation. [ Religious attitudes ] In Islam, after the emission of pre-ejaculate fluid, ritual purification is recommended, by washing the affected areas (including clothing) with water. The pre-ejaculate fluid calls for washing and ablution before praying. However, it does not require ritual purificatory bath, unlike the semen which comes after the ejaculation.
