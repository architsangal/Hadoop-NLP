[ History ] Buckley was an Anglo-Saxon location, with some of its houses later recorded in the Norman Domesday Book of the 11th century. However, the first documented evidence of its existence dates from 1294 when it was described as the pasturage of the Manor of Ewloe, spelled as &quot; Bokkeley &quot;. The name Buckley may derive from the Old English bok lee, meaning meadow, or field. The likely meaning of the name was &quot; clearing in a beech wood &quot; (with boc meaning beech tree and ley meaning wood, glade or clearing). The name could also have been construed from bucc, a buck or deer; or bwlch y clai, meaning clay hole. [ http://www.buckleysociety.org.uk/about_buckley.htm About Buckley Buckley History Society 2 September 2009 ] In 1420, Henry V presented Ewloe and the pastorage of Buckley to his wife, Catherine of Valois, as a wedding present. It was worth £26 per annum. [ http://www.buckleytc.org.uk/index.php?Home%3AHistory History of Buckley Buckley Town Council 14 August 2009 2 September 2009 ] The town became an industrial heartland for pottery and coal mining between the 17th and 19th centuries. The first was opened in 1737. However, it only grew into any kind of prominence during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, when coal and clay were extensively mined there, and the name Buckley became synonymous with the production of various fire-clay and pottery products. By the early 19th century, there were 14 potteries in the town. Buckley was a popular location for mining, as there were many faults in local rock formations that allowed seams of coal to be mined directly from the surface. Its heavy, clay soil also allowed for excellent pottery and bricks to be manufactured. Bricks from Buckley were transported all across the United Kingdom and as far as the United States, as Buckley became a brickworking centre. A great deal of people moved into the area, particularly from Ireland and Liverpool to find work in the mining and brick industries, giving the town a distinctive accent. Many pottery and earthenware products manufactured were taken on the backs of donkeys to either Chester market or exported via the River Dee, as early as the reign of Elizabeth I. The last pottery kiln was fired in 1946. The site of the brickworks is now being redeveloped as a housing estate. However, a local cement works is still in operation. In 1932, a tradition started in Buckley of running an annual pantomime. Dennis Griffiths produced a version of Dick Whittington in 1933, and ran the pantomime for 27 years, famously using the programme to invite any and all complaints to arrive written &quot; on the back of a 10 shilling note (non-returnable) &quot;. In the Second World War, a Nazi German Luftwaffe plane, most likely on its way to blitz Liverpool was shot down and crash landed in a nearby district, with the plane&apos;s engine crashing into a small lake known locally as &apos;The Trap&apos;. The pilot survived, captured by a Special Constable, Peter Griffiths and taken to Hawarden Prisoner of War camp. [ Governance ] Urban district status was conferred on the town in 1898; at this time, the area comprised two parishes, Buckley (1874) and Bistre (1844). The urban district of Buckley was formed of Ewloe, Pentrobin and Bannel (which was formerly a part of the parish of Hawarden ), Argoed, and Bistre (the oldest part of the town). Wat&apos;s Dyke formed the western boundary. Prior to then, it was divided between the parishes of Mold and Hawarden. Buckley is part of the Alyn and Deeside UK parliamentary constituency and the Alyn and Deeside Welsh Assembly consituency. [ Geography and climate ] Buckley is situated in north east Wales approximately 6 miles from the border with England to the East. Buckley is in the lee of the Snowdonian mountain range to the west and is therefore in a rain shadow area. Average annual rainfall in Buckley is approximately 700 - 800mm (28 - 30  inches) which is significantly lower than areas to the West of the Snowdonian mountain range. However, in comparison to areas in the East and South East of the United Kingdom, Buckley still receives a fair amount of rainfall. Since Buckley is located approximately 130 - 150m (430 – 480  feet) above sea level, snowfall is more frequent in winter months in comparison to the lower lying ground in neighbouring areas. Areas in the parish of Buckley outside the town centre include Bistre, Lane End, Padeswood, Buckley Mountain, Drury, Pentrobin, Bannel, Alltami, and Ewloe. [ Dialect ] Although very few locals speak with a &apos;Buckley&apos; accent nowadays, due to people moving in and out of the area, and with the proliferation of television and radio, a few of the town&apos;s older citizens still speak in a form of the strongly accented dialect, full of colloquialism s, and often unintelligible to outsiders. One of the last remaining pure &apos;Buckley&apos; speakers was noted linguist Dennis Griffiths, a Buckley resident, who died in 1972, and whose books are the main repository and record of the dialect. A few examples (mainly phonetic ) are noted below: Wunst every blue moon - rarely occurring Thou fries me to death - the limit of boredom A lick and a promise - a quick wash Fasen the fost un fost - fasten the first one first The daddy on um aw - the best of the lot Husht thee naise - be quiet I conna meke thee out - I can&apos;t understand you Chunner - Complain The last &apos;pure&apos; speaker of the Buckley dialect was Joseph Charles Shone, a foundryman born in 1917, who died in 1987. [ Economy ] { kiln under construction. } Today, Buckley has a population of around 14,500, and has numerous light industries. Those who cannot find work locally commute to Deeside, Cheshire, Wrexham and Merseyside. The Hanson Cement works at Padeswood is the only large scale industry remaining in the town. Its 200  ft kiln is now the major landmark on the skyline, visible from many miles away. Despite many locals considering it an eyesore, according to its website, the company has reduced pollution produced by the cement works by up to 90%.

It has a large playground for children, as well as a duck pond. A funfair visits during the Buckley Jubilee in the summer, usually on the second Tuesday of July, which is the town jubilee. There is also a small lake, known as &apos;The Trap&apos;, which is stocked with coarse fish. A German Messerschmitt bomber crashed into the Trap during World War II, shot down by anti-aircraft fire after going off course following a bombing run over Liverpool. The land is primarily heavy clay soil. Etna Park, which is just a short walk from the town centre, is part of the Heritage Trail walk in the area. Buckley has a shopping precinct, as well as one supermarket (run by a Somerfield and The Co-op coalition). There is a town-centre car park which is free of charge. The town contains a wide variety of public house s, which includes the local working men&apos;s club. The local branch of The Royal British Legion closed in 2010. [ Education ] Buckley has four primary school s : Westwood County Primary, Mountain Lane Primary School, Buckley Southdown County Primary, and Drury County Primary. Buckley has one secondary school, the Elfed High School, located near the Common on Mill Lane. During the Second World War, it was built as a military hospital, and adapted for school use shortly after, in the early 1950s. Now in extreme circumstances the roof can convert into a landing pad for light aircraft and helicopters. The school includes a sports centre, and a swimming pool, for use of both the students and the public. Many students from Buckley also attend Argoed High School, located in nearby Bryn-y-Baal, or the Alun School, in Mold. All schools in Buckley are run by the Flintshire Local Education Authority. [ Religion ] Buckley is unusual in having two ecclesiastical parishes. The Church of St Matthew is the oldest parish church in the town, and was consecrated in 1822. Bistre Emmanuel Parish Church was built in 1842, despite appearing much older due to its early Gothic-style architecture. The first Primitive Methodist church in Wales is on the outskirts of Buckley, in Alltami. The present St John&apos;s United Reformed Church was originally a chapel known as &quot; Chapel in the Meadow &quot;, set up by a noncomformist pottery owner, Jonathan Catherall, in 1737. Catherall received special dispensation from Lord Hawkesbury, after whom he named his house, to hold services at his house. As the Church forbade chapels from having bells, he built a bell tower in the grounds of his home. The site of this unique non-conformist bell tower is marked by a mound and plaque near the skate park at the Elfed Sports Complex. The Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic church in Buckley was built in 2000 to replace a much older building. Other churches in Buckley include Bistre Methodist, Pentrobin Methodist, Buckley Cross Methodist, Bryn Methodist, and Drury Lane Methodist.

Officially, however, the Jubilee was begun in 1856. The difference in dates stems from the &apos;official&apos; date being set when the Buckley Temperance Society first sanctioned the march. The Jubilee is a ceremonial march that begins on &quot; The Common &quot;, a large area of common ground owned by the people of the town used for leisure and recreational purposes. The term &apos;jubilee&apos; was first used in 1871. [ http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/20428 Buckley Jubilee Procession Gathering the Jewels 5 August 2005 ] On the Common starting at around 3pm is a non-denominational Service led by the Minister of the Church/Chapel leading the Jubilee that year. The Sunday before the Jubilee, the leading church is presented with the Centenary Shield, which they hold for the year. A fifteen-minute service takes place, with two hymns accompanied by the Royal Buckley Town Band. The march then leaves the common, and marches through the town, with representatives from the local Sunday School s, Scout and Guide troops, and many of the local schools. Banners from each of the local faiths are carried. [ Royal Buckley Town Band ] Buckley has a famous brass band, the Royal Buckley Town Band. The band is one of only two in the entire United Kingdom to have received sanction from a British monarch to use &quot; Royal &quot; in their name. They lead the Jubilee every year. [ Popular music ] Buckley has one nightclub, the Tivoli Nightclub (known locally as &quot; The Tiv &quot; ), on Brunswick Road. Formerly both a cinema and a music hall, the Tivoli has seen many bands play there over the years, including Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin in the early 1970s, and many Britpop bands including Oasis, Ocean Colour Scene and the Super Furry Animals in the 1990s. It has been described as &apos;one of the finest quirky little venues of our time&apos; and is featured in the DVD re-issue of Oasis&apos; album, Definitely Maybe.

[ http://www.greenplastic.com/gigography/index.php?year%3D1992 Radiohead gigography 14 June 2006 ] Since a renovation and rebranding in 2000, few bands played live at the venue, with the club music policy having more emphasis on commercial dance and pop music, with a rock night on Fridays. Recently, bands such as Cast, Ash, Stiff Little Fingers, Fun Lovin&apos; Criminals, Skindred, Hed PE and OPM have all played there. The venue attracts crowds from Chester, Wrexham, Manchester and Liverpool. [ Radio ] The town was also home to a community radio project which used to broadcast &apos;trial&apos; or &apos;temporary radio&apos; licences to Buckley, Broughton, Mold, Deeside and the surrounding areas. The station was known as South Flintshire Radio and its offices were found above the swimming baths on Mold Road. The station was heard on eight separate occasions between November 1996 and July 2000 as part of a campaign to bring a local radio station to Flintshire, following the demise of Mold-based BBC Radio Clwyd. The project helped pave the way for a permanent local radio licence which was awarded to Chester FM (known as Dee 106.3 ) which broadcasts to Chester, Ellesmere Port, Deeside and Buckley. [ Library ] Buckley has a sizable two-storey library, with the second level being dedicated solely to history and reference pieces, mainly on the local area. The second floor also doubles as the local museum. [ Sport ] Buckley has a football club in the Cymru Alliance, Buckley Town F.C.. In addition to the men&apos;s team Buckley also has a women&apos;s team, Buckley Town Ladies FC, who play in the North Wales Coast Women&apos;s Football League. The Elfed Sports Complex was built in 2005, near the Elfed High School, and includes a swimming pool, which replaced the outdated, Victorian-style baths on the Mold Road high street. [ Transport ] [ Road ] Buckley is located on the A549 road, and is near the A55 expressway, which passes to the south of Ewloe. [ Bus ] There are a number of bus routes that pass through Buckley, mostly operated by Arriva Buses Wales, which now means on most weekdays a bus to Chester or Mold is available every 10 minutes. [ Rail ] [ Wrexham, Mold and Connah&apos;s Quay Railway ] Buckley railway station opened on 14 June 1860, with a line serving as a 5-mile (8  km) line from Buckley to a junction with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Chester - Holyhead main line at Connah&apos;s Quay, in order to link collieries and brickworks in the Buckley area with a point of shipment on the River Dee. The Wrexham, Mold and Connah&apos;s Quay Railway (WMCQR) was incorporated on 7 August 1862 to build a line from Wrexham to Buckley. The Buckley Railway was opened in 1864 as a freight -carrying line, and was worked by horses. The WMCQR line - [ 12.5 mi km ] in length - opened as a single line with short branches from Buckley to a point near the Great Western Railway station at Wrexham; it also had a connection with the London and North Western Railway at Hope. The WMCQR took over the Buckley Railway from 30 June 1873. Today, Buckley railway station is a minor stop on the Borderlands Line, which runs from Wrexham to Bidston on the Wirral. It is owned and operated by Arriva Trains Wales. Trains run every 60 minutes, Monday to Saturday daytimes, and infrequently at other times. Connections can be made at Shotton, Wrexham General or Bidston railway stations. There are two platforms, one for each direction the line runs in. [ Air ] The nearest major airports are Liverpool John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport, both around 45 minutes&apos; drive away, although there are minor airfields in nearby Hawarden and Broughton.
