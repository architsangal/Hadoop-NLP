Box Office Mojo Internet Movie Database August 13, 2010 ] { $20,915,465 } { English } Super Mario Bros. is a 1993 American fantasy adventure film [ http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/super-mario-bros-v47787 Super Mario Bros. Allrovi Rovi Corporation September 19, 2011 ] directed by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. Based on the 1985 Nintendo video game of the same name and its entire franchise, the film stars Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper and Samantha Mathis. It tells the story of the Mario brothers, Mario and Luigi, as they find a parallel universe, where King Koopa is a dictator. They have to rescue Princess Daisy and stop Koopa from attempting to merge the dimensions so that he could become a dictator of both worlds. Super Mario Bros. was released on May 28, 1993, and received mainly negative reviews. It was a box office bomb, recouping only $21 million of its $48 million budget. Despite this, the film was nominated for two Saturn Award s (one for Best Costume, the other for Best Make-up ). [ Plot ] Mario and Luigi Mario are two Italian American plumbers living in Brooklyn, New York. The brothers are being driven out of business by the mafia-like Scapelli Construction Company, led by contractor Anthony Scapelli. Mario is the elder of the two brothers, being close to the late 30&apos;s, and Luigi is in his mid 20&apos;s. Luigi falls in love with an orphaned NYU student, Daisy, who is digging under the Brooklyn Bridge for dinosaur bones. After a date, she takes Luigi to the dig and witnesses Scapelli&apos;s men (who, along with Scapelli himself, had previously threatened her to end her research on that specific piece of land for their own interests) sabotage it by leaving the water-pipes open. Luigi tries to stop it but he does not have his tools on him so he cannot fix it. They rush back to his apartment where they inform Mario about the incident. The three go back to the flooding and the brothers manage to fix it but are knocked out by two strange characters, Iggy and Spike, who proceed to kidnap Daisy. Mario and Luigi awaken a minute later and head deeper into the caves following Daisy&apos;s screams and discover an interdimensional portal through which Mario and Luigi follow Daisy. They find themselves in a strange dystopian parallel world where a human-like race evolved from dinosaurs rather than the mammalian ancestry of true humans. Sixty-five million years ago, a meteorite crashed into the Earth and in doing so ripped the universe into two parallel dimensions. All the surviving dinosaurs of the time crossed over into this new realm. Iggy and Spike turn out to be henchmen (and cousins) of the other world&apos;s germophobic and obsessive dictator, King Koopa, descended from the T-Rex. However, the two have failed to also bring Daisy&apos;s rock, a meteorite fragment which Koopa is trying to get in order to merge his world with the real world that separated from Koopa&apos;s world during the meteor strike. It turns out that Daisy is the Princess of the other dimension but when Koopa overthrew Daisy&apos;s father (and turned him into fungus), Daisy&apos;s mother took her to New York using the inter-dimensional portal. The portal was then destroyed, killing Daisy&apos;s mother in the process, but when Scapelli was blasting at the cave, the portal was reopened. When Koopa hears about the re-opening of the portal, he sends Spike and Iggy to find Daisy and the rock to merge the dimensions and make Koopa dictator of both worlds. Spike and Iggy, however, who had grown more intelligent after being subjected to one of Koopa&apos;s experiments, decide to turn on Koopa and join forces with Mario and Luigi. Koopa thinks only Daisy can merge the worlds, but Mario and Luigi were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Daisy is eventually rescued by the plumbers. Eventually, the two worlds merge and Koopa inadvertently devolves Scapelli into a primate while aiming for Mario, but Luigi and Daisy take back the rock and the worlds separate again. Mario confronts Koopa and eventually wins when he and Luigi devolve him, transforming him into a ferocious, semi-humanoid Tyrannosaurus. Koopa then leaps out for a final attack but Mario and Luigi destroy him by devolving him into primeval slime. Daisy&apos;s father turns back to normal and reclaims control over the kingdom stating he loves those plumbers. The citizens destroy anything involving Koopa. As the brothers return home, Luigi and Daisy admit their love for one another but Daisy cannot return to New York until the damage caused by Koopa is reversed and she spends more time with her father. Mario rephrases Daisy&apos;s words to Luigi but he does not care. A deeply hurt and saddened Luigi kisses her goodbye and the two brothers return to New York, while Daisy watches them leave. About three weeks later, Daisy returns for Mario and Luigi&apos;s help in fighting more villains. Meanwhile, Mario and Luigi&apos;s story is televised, giving them the name; &quot; Super Mario Bros &quot;. In a post-credits scene, two Nintendo executives talk about a video game based on their adventures but they are asking Iggy and Spike instead of the Super Mario Bros. and they decide on a title called &quot; The Super Koopa Cousins &quot;.

It was a husband-and-wife directing team who were both control freaks and wouldn&apos;t talk before they made decisions. Anyway, I was supposed to go down there for five weeks, and I was there for 17. It was so over budget. &quot; [ http://www.avclub.com/articles/random-roles-dennis-hopper%2C2549/ Random Roles: Dennis Hopper December 12, 2008 AV Club August 2, 2010 ] Shigeru Miyamoto, Mario&apos;s creator stated, &quot; [In] the end, it was a very fun project that they put a lot of effort into, &quot; but also said, &quot; The one thing that I still have some regrets about is that the movie may have tried to get a little too close to what the Mario Bros. video games were. And in that sense, it became a movie that was about a video game, rather than being an entertaining movie in and of itself. &quot; [ http://www.next-gen.biz/features/miyamoto-interview MIYAMOTO: THE INTERVIEW Edge Magazine November 27, 2007 August 9, 2010 ] [ Soundtrack ] [ Super Mario Brothers Soundtrack Various Smb soundtrack cover.jpg 1993 Pop, Rock, Metal, Funk, Hip hop, Soul, Jazz rap Capitol ] The soundtrack, released on Capitol Records, featured two songs from Roxette : &quot; Almost Unreal &quot; which was released as a single. The music video for &quot; Almost Unreal &quot; was inspired by the film, featuring scenes from the film and a de-evolution theme. &quot; Almost Unreal &quot; was originally written for the film Hocus Pocus but was never used and ended up attached to the Mario film instead. The change angered Roxette co-founder Per Gessle. { liner notes to Roxette album, } { Don&apos;t Bore Us, Get to the Chorus! } The film&apos;s score was composed by Alan Silvestri. It has not been officially released, though bootleg copies do exist.
