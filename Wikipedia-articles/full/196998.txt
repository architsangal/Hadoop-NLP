A positive diagnosis generally requires observing specific macroscopic and microscopic changes. The normal squamous epithelium lining of the esophagus is replaced by metaplastic columnar and goblet cells. Columnar epithelium refers to a cell type that is typically found in more distal parts of the gastrointestinal system. Only the presence of goblet cells equates a diagnosis of Barrett esophagus. The medical significance of Barrett esophagus is its strong association with esophageal adenocarcinoma, a particularly lethal cancer. The main cause of Barrett esophagus is thought to be an adaptation to chronic acid exposure from reflux esophagitis. [ Stein H, Siewert J Barrett&apos;s esophagus: pathogenesis, epidemiology, functional abnormalities, malignant degeneration, and surgical management Dysphagia 8 3 276–88 1993 8359051 10.1007/BF01354551 ] In the last 40 years, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been increasing in the Western world. Barrett esophagus is found in 5–15% of patients who seek medical care for heartburn ( gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD), although a large subgroup of patients with Barrett esophagus do not have symptoms. It is considered to be a premalignant condition because it is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer (more specifically, adenocarcinoma) of about 0.5% per patient-year. If the cancer develops, it is very often deadly. [ Shaheen NJ, Richter JE Barrett oesophagus Lancet 373 9666 850–61 2009 March 19269522 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60487-6 ] [ Koppert L, Wijnhoven B, van Dekken H, Tilanus H, Dinjens W The molecular biology of esophageal adenocarcinoma J Surg Oncol 92 3 169–90 2005 16299787 10.1002/jso.20359 ] Diagnosis of Barrett esophagus requires endoscopy (more specifically, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, a procedure in which a fibre optic cable is inserted through the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum ) and biopsy. The cells of Barrett esophagus, after biopsy, are classified into four general categories: non-dysplastic, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and frank carcinoma. High-grade dysplasia and frank carcinoma patients are generally advised to undergo surgical treatment. Non-dysplastic and low-grade patients are generally advised to undergo annual observation with endoscopy. In high-grade dysplasia, the risk of developing cancer might be at 10% per patient-year or greater. The condition is named after Norman Barrett (1903 –1979) who described the condition in 1950.

Barrett esophagus, however, is associated with the following symptoms: frequent and longstanding heartburn trouble swallowing ( dysphagia ) vomiting blood ( hematemesis ) pain under the breastbone where the esophagus meets the stomach unintentional weight loss because eating is painful The risk of developing Barrett esophagus is increased by central (vs. peripheral) obesity. [ Edelstein ZR, Farrow DC, Bronner MP, Rosen SN, Vaughan TL Central adiposity and risk of Barrett esophagus Gastroenterology 133 2 403–11 2007 August 17681161 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.05.026 ] The exact mechanism is unclear. The difference in distribution of fat among men (more central) and women (more peripheral) may explain the increased risk in males.

Cancer 10 2 87–101 2010 February 20094044 10.1038/nrc2773 2879265 ] [ Mechanism ] Barrett esophagus occurs due to chronic inflammation. The principal cause of the chronic inflammation is gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD (UK: GORD). In this disease, acidic stomach, bile, small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to the cells of the lower esophagus. Recently, it was shown that bile acids are able to induce intestinal differentiation, in gastroesophageal junction cells, through inhibition of the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) receptor which results in inhibition of Akt, upregulation of the p50 subunit of NF-kB ( NFKB1 ) and ultimately activation of the promotor of the homeobox gene CDX2. The latter mastergene is responsible for the expression of intestinal markers such as Guanylate cyclase 2C [ Debruyne PR, Witek M, Gong L, Birbe R, Chervoneva I, Jin T, Domon-Cell C, Palazzo JP, Freund JN, Li P, Pitari GM, Schulz S, Waldman SA Bile acids induce ectopic expression of intestinal guanylyl cyclase C Through nuclear factor-kappaB and Cdx2 in human esophageal cells Gastroenterology 130 4 1191–206 2006 April 16618413 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.12.032 ]. [ Gong L, Debruyne PR, Witek M, Nielsen K, Snook A, Lin JE, Bombonati A, Palazzo J, Schulz S, Waldman SA Bile acids initiate lineage-addicted gastroesophageal tumorigenesis by suppressing the EGF receptor-AKT axis Clin Transl Sci. 2 4 286–93 2009 20443907 10.1111/j.1752-8062.2009.00131.x ] This mechanism explains the selecion of HER2/neu (or ERBB2) overexpressing (lineage-addicted) cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the Her-2 receptor with trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).Researchers are unable to predict which heartburn sufferers will develop Barrett esophagus. While there is no relationship between the severity of heartburn and the development of Barrett esophagus, there is a relationship between chronic heartburn and the development of Barrett esophagus. Sometimes people with Barrett esophagus will have no heartburn symptoms at all. In rare cases, damage to the esophagus may be caused by swallowing a corrosive substance such as lye. [ Diagnosis ] { Micrograph of Barrett&apos;s esophagus (left of image) and normal } { stratified squamous epithelium (right of image). } { Alcian blue stain. } { goblet cell s. Alcian blue stain. } Both macroscopic (from endoscopy) and microscopic positive findings are required to make a diagnosis. Barrett esophagus is marked by the presence of columnar epithelia in the lower esophagus, replacing the normal squamous cell epithelium —an example of metaplasia. The secretory columnar epithelium may be more able to withstand the erosive action of the gastric secretions; however, this metaplasia confers an increased risk of adenocarcinoma. [ Fléjou J Barrett&apos;s oesophagus: from metaplasia to dysplasia and cancer Gut 54 Suppl 1 i6–12 2005 15711008 10.1136/gut.2004.041525 1867794 ] The presence of goblet cells, called intestinal metaplasia, is necessary to make a diagnosis of Barrett esophagus. This frequently occurs in the presence of other metaplastic columnar cells but only the presence of goblet cells is diagnostic. The metaplasia of Barrett esophagus is grossly visible through a gastroscope, but biopsy specimens must be examined under a microscope to determine whether cells are gastric or colonic in nature. Colonic metaplasia is usually identified by finding goblet cells in the epithelium and is necessary for the true diagnosis of Barrett. There are many histologic mimics of Barrett esophagus (i.e. goblet cells occurring in the transitional epithelium of normal esophageal submucosal gland ducts, &quot; pseudogoblet cells &quot; in which abundant foveolar (gastric) type mucin simulates the acid mucin true goblet cells). Assessment of relationship to submucosal glands and transitional-type epithelium with examination of multiple levels through the tissue may allow the pathologist to reliably distinguish between goblet cells of submucosal gland ducts and true Barrett esophagus (specialized columnar metaplasia). Use of the histochemical stain Alcian blue pH 2.5 is also frequently used to distinguish true intestinal-type mucins from their histologic mimics. Recently, immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to CDX-2 (specific for mid and hindgut intestinal derivation) has also been utilized to identify true intestinal-type metaplastic cells. It has been shown that the protein AGR2 is elevated in Barrett esophagus, [ Elizabeth Pohler, Ashley L. Craig, James Cotton, Laura Lawrie, John F. Dillon, Pete Ross, Neil Kernohan and Ted R.

There is considerable variability in assessment for dysplasia among pathologists. Recently, gastroenterology and GI pathology societies have recommended that any diagnosis of high grade dysplasia in Barrett be confirmed by at least two fellowship trained GI pathologists prior to definitive treatment for patients. [ Management ] Many professional medical societies propose endoscopic screening of patients with GERD and endoscopic surveillance of patients with Barrett esophagus, although little direct evidence supports this practice, which is common in many developed countries. Treatment options for high-grade dysplasia include surgical removal of the esophagus ( esophagectomy ) or endoscopic treatments such as endoscopic mucosal resection or ablation (destruction). Currently, there is no intervention that has been shown to prevent the development of Barrett esophagus or its progression to esophageal cancer. The risk of malignancy is highest in the U.S. in Caucasian men more than 50 years of age with more than 5 years of symptoms. Current recommendations include routine endoscopy and biopsy (looking for dysplastic change s ). If two endoscopies and biopsy sessions performed within 12 months are negative for dysplasia then surveillance can be performed every 3 years while the underlying reflux is controlled with proton pump inhibitor drugs in combination with measures to prevent reflux. For patients found to have low grade or high grade dysplasia close observation and repeat endoscopy and biopsies are indicated and the patient should be followed closely by a gastroenterologist. Proton pump inhibitor drugs have not yet been proven to prevent esophageal cancer. Laser treatment is used in severe dysplasia, while overt malignancy may require surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic chemotherapy. Additionally, a recent 5-year random-controlled trial has shown that photodynamic therapy using photofrin is statistically more effective in eliminating dysplastic growth areas than sole use of a proton pump inhibitor.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy 66 3 460–8 2007 17643436 10.1016/j.gie.2006.12.037 ] There is presently no reliable way to determine which patients with Barrett esophagus will go on to develop esophageal cancer, although a recent study found that the detection of three different genetic abnormalities were associated with as much as a 79% chance of developing cancer in 6 years.

[ Reshamwala P, Darwin P Endoscopic management of early gastric cancer Curr Opin Gastroenterol 22 5 541–5 2006 16891887 10.1097/01.mog.0000239870.04457.80 ] Additionally an operation known as a Nissen fundoplication can reduce the reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus.

In addition, the best dose of NSAIDs for cancer prevention is not yet known. [ Prognosis ] Barrett esophagus is only a premalignant condition. Its malignant sequela, esophageal adenocarcinoma, has a mortality rate of over 85%.
