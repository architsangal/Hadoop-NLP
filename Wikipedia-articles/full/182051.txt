[ Cave bear Middle to Late Pleistocene Teufelshöhle-Höhlenbär-Dreiviertelprofil.jpg 250px Mounted cave bear skeleton Animal ia Chordata Mammal ia Carnivora Ursidae Ursus U. spelaeus Ursus spelaeus Rosenmüller, 1794 ] The cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) was a species of bear that lived in Europe during the Pleistocene and became extinct at the beginning of the Last Glacial Maximum about 27,500 years ago. Both the name cave and the scientific name spelaeus derive from the fact that fossils of this species were mostly found in caves, indicating that this species spent more time in caves than the brown bear, which only uses caves for hibernation. Consequently, in the course of time, whole layers of bones, almost entire skeletons, were found in many caves. [ History of cave bear discoveries ] Rearing &apos;&apos;Ursus spelaeus&apos;&apos; skeleton Cave bear skeletons were first described in 1774 by Johann Friederich Esper in his book Newly Discovered Zoolites of Unknown Four Footed Animals. Originally thought to belong to dragon s, unicorn s, ape s, canid s or felid s, Esper postulated that they actually belonged to polar bear s. Twenty years later, Johann Christian Rosenmüller, an anatomist at the Leipzig University, gave the species its binomial name. The bones were so numerous that most researchers held little respect for them. During World War I, large amounts of cave bear bones were used as a source of phosphate s, leaving behind little more than skulls and leg bones. Many caves in Central Europe have skeletons of cave bears inside, for example the Heinrichshöhle in Hemer or the Dechenhöhle in Iserlohn, Germany. In Romania, there is a cave called Bears&apos; Cave where 140 cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983. { Cave Bears. Jan Kowalski. psu.edu } [ Description and biology ] [ Range and habitat ] The cave bear&apos;s range stretched across Europe, from Spain to Eurasia, from Italy and Greece to Belgium, the Netherlands and Great Britain, across a portion of Germany through Poland, then south into Hungary, Romania and parts of Russia, Caucasus and northern Iran. There have been no traces of cave bears living in northern Britain, Scandinavia or the Baltic countries, which were covered in extensive glacier s at the time. The largest numbers of cave bear remains have been found in Austria, Switzerland, southern Germany, northern Italy, northern Spain, Croatia, Hungary, and Romania. The huge number of bones found in south, central and east Europe has led some scientists to think that Europe may have once had literal herds of cave bears. Some however point out that though some caves have thousands of bones, they were accumulated over a period of 100,000 years or more, thus requiring only two deaths in a cave per year to account for the large numbers. [ Bieder, Robert http://www.amazon.com/dp/1861892047 Bear 2005 192 1-86189-204-7 Reaktion Books London ] The cave bear inhabited low mountainous areas, especially in regions rich in limestone caves. They seem to have avoided open plains, preferring forested or forest-edged terrains. [ Anatomy ] Life restoration The cave bear had a very broad, domed skull with a steep forehead. Its stout body had long thighs, massive shins and in-turning feet, making it similar in skeletal structure to the brown bear. [ Brown, Gary http://www.amazon.com/dp/1558214747 Great Bear Almanac 1996 340 1-55821-474-7 ] Cave bears were comparable in size to the largest modern day bears. The average weight for males was 400–500 kilograms (880–1102 pounds), while females weighed 225–250  kg (496–551  lbs). [ http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf36/anzf36-093p.pdf Annales Zoologici Fennici 36 93–102 1999 What size were Arctodus simus and Ursus spelaeus (Carnivora: Ursidae)? Per Christiansen ] Of cave bear skeletons in museums, 90% are male due to a misconception that the female skeletons were merely &quot; dwarfs &quot;. Cave bears grew larger during glaciations and smaller during interglacials, probably to adjust heat loss rate. [ Macdonald, David http://www.amazon.com/dp/0563208449 The Velvet Claw 1992 256 0-563-20844-9 Parkwest New York ] Cave bears of the last ice age lacked the usual 2–3 premolars present in other bears; to compensate, the last molar is very elongated, with supplementary cusps. { Gli orsi spelèi delle Conturines/ Ursus Spelaeus. Altabadia.it. Retrieved on 2011-09-26. } The humerus of the cave bear was similar in size to that of the polar bear, as were the femora of females. The femora of male cave bears, however, bore more similarities in size to those of kodiak bear s. [ Dietary habits ] Cave bear teeth show greater wear than most modern bear species, suggesting a diet of tough materials. However, tubers and other gritty food, which cause distinctive tooth wear in modern brown bears, do not appear to have constituted a major part of cave bears&apos; diet on the basis of dental microwear analysis. { Pinto Llona, A.

Cave bears lacked the usual 2–3 premolars present in other bear species. The morphological features of the cave bear chewing apparatus, including loss of premolars, have long been suggested to indicate that their diets displayed a higher degree of herbivory than the Eurasian brown bear. Indeed, a solely vegetarian diet has been inferred on the basis of tooth morphology. Results obtained on the stable isotopes of cave bear bones also point to a largely vegetarian diet in having low levels of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13, [ Bocherens, H., et al.

However, some evidence points toward inclusion of at least occasional animal protein in the cave bear diet. For example, toothmarks on cave bear remains in areas where cave bears are the only recorded potential carnivore s suggests occasional cannibalistic scavenging, [ http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C320971%2C00.html Prehistoric Cave Bears Weren&apos;t So Cuddly After All FOXNews 2008-01-11 2008-01-09 ] [ Pacher, M.

Isotopic evidence for omnivory among European cave bears: Late Pleistocene Ursus spelaeus from the Pestera cu Oase, Romania. 2008 PNAS 105 100–104 ] although the values are within the range of those found for the strictly herbivorous mammoth. { Bocherens, H. 2003: Isotopic biogeochemistry and the paleoecology of the mammoth steppe fauna.

Deinsea 9. } Although the current prevailing opinion concludes that cave bears were largely herbivorous, and more so than any modern species of the genus Ursus, increasing evidence points to an omnivorous diet, based both on regional variability of isotopic composition of bone remains indicative of dietary plasticity, and on a recent reevaluation of its craniodental morphology that places the cave bear squarely among omnivorous modern bear species with respect to its skull and tooth shapes.

Male cave bear skeletons have been found with broken baculum s, probably due to fighting during breeding season. [ Kurten, Bjorn Pleistocene Mammals of Europe 1968 325 0-202-30953-3 AldineTransaction New Brunswick, N.J. ] Cave bear longevity is unknown, though it has been estimated that they seldom exceeded 20 years of age. [ Bieder, Robert Bear 2005 192 1-86189-204-7 Reaktion Books London ] Paleontologists doubt adult cave bears had any natural predators, save for pack hunting wolves and cave hyena s which would probably have attacked sick or infirm specimens. Cave hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for the hyenas, especially at the end of the winter, when food was scarce.

Carnivores quaternaires de Bourgogne 1991 Documents des Laboratoires de Géologie de la Faculté des Sciences de Lyon 115 1–301 ] while other authorities consider both taxa to be chronological variants of the same species. [ Mazza, P. &amp; Rustioni, M. On the phylogeny of Eurasian bears 1994 Palaeontographica Abteilung A 230 1–32 ] Cave bears found in different regions vary in age, thus facilitating investigations into evolutionary trends. The three anterior premolar s were gradually reduced, then disappeared, possibly in response to a largely vegetarian diet. In a fourth of the skulls found in the Conturines, the third premolar is still present, while more derived specimens elsewhere lack it. The last remaining premolar became conjugated with the true molars, enlarging the crown and granting it more cusps and cutting borders. This phenomenon known as molarization improved the mastication capacities of the molars, facilitating the processing of tough vegetation. This allowed the cave bear to gain more energy for hibernation while eating less than its ancestors. { Gli orsi spelèi delle Conturines/ Ursus Spelaeus. Altabadia.it. Retrieved on 2011-09-26. } [ Recovery of fossil DNA ] In May 2005, scientists in California succeeded in recovering and sequencing nuclear DNA of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago. The procedure used genomic DNA extracted from the animal&apos;s tooth. Sequencing the DNA directly (rather than first replicating it with the polymerase chain reaction ), the scientists were able to recover 21 cave bear gene s from remains that did not yield significant amounts of DNA with traditional techniques. [ Noonan, James P.; et al. Genomic Sequencing of Pleistocene Cave Bears 2005 Science 309 5734 597–599 10.1126/science.1113485 15933159 ] This study confirmed and built on results from a previous study using mitochondrial DNA extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old. Both show the cave bear to be more closely related to the brown bear and polar bear than the American black bear, but having split from the brown bear lineage prior to the diversification of distinct eastern and western brown bear lineages and prior to the split of brown bears and polar bears. The divergence date estimate of cave bears and brown bears is ~1.2–1.4 Mya. [ Causes of extinction ] Recent reassessment of fossils indicate the cave bear probably died out 27,800 years ago. It has been suggested that a complex set of factors, rather than a single factor, led to the extinction. [ Stiller, Mathias; et al. Withering Away—25,000 Years of Genetic Decline Preceded Cave Bear Extinction 10.1093/molbev/msq083 Molecular Biology and Evolution 27 20335279 5 975–978 2010 ] { The Fate of the Cave Bear, Smithsonian Magazine, December 2010. Retrieved on 2011-09-26. } Compared with other megafauna l species that also became extinct during the last Glacial Maximum, the cave bear was believed to have had a more specialized diet of high-quality plants and a relatively restricted geographical range. This was suggested as an explanation as to why it died out so much earlier than the rest. [ Pacher M. &amp; Stuart A.J. Extinction chronology and palaeobiology of the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) 10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00071.x Boreas 38 2 189–206 2009 ] Some experts have disputed this claim as the cave bear had survived multiple climate changes prior to extinction. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA research indicated that the genetic decline of the cave bear began long before it went extinct, demonstrating that habitat loss due to climate change was not responsible. Finally, high δ 15 N levels were found in cave bear bones from Romania, indicating wider dietary possibilities than previously believed. [ Trinkaus, Erik &amp; Richards, Michael P. Reply to Grandal and Fernández: Hibernation can also cause high δ15N values in cave bears 10.1073/pnas.0801137105 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 105 11 E15 2008 ] Overhunting by human s has been largely dismissed because human populations at the time were too small to pose a serious threat to the cave bear&apos;s survival, though there is evidence that the two species may have competed for living space in caves. Unlike brown bears, cave bears are seldom represented in cave paintings, leading some experts to believe that the cave bear may have been avoided by human hunters { The Walking Larder: Patterns of Domestication, Pastoralism, and Predation by Juliet Clutton-Brock, published by Routledge, 1990, ISBN 0-04-445900-9 } or their habitat preferences may not have overlapped. The late paleontologist Bjorn Kurten hypothesized that cave bear populations were fragmented and under stress even before the advent of the glaciers. It is possible that populations living south of the Alps survived significantly longer. There is some evidence that the cave bear only used caves for hibernation and was not inclined to use other locations, such as thicket s, for this purpose, in contrast to the more versatile brown bear. This specialized hibernation behavior would have caused a high winter mortality rate for cave bears that failed to find available caves. Therefore, as human populations slowly increased, the cave bear faced a shrinking pool of suitable caves, and slowly faded away to extinction, as both Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans sought out caves as living quarters, depriving the cave bear of vital habitat. This hypothesis is being researched at this time. [ Cave bear worship ] { rock art from the } { Les Combarelles cave } Collections of bear bones at several widely dispersed sites suggest that Neanderthal s may have worship ped cave bears, especially at Drachenloch, in Switzerland, where a stone chest was discovered with a number of bear skulls stacked upon it. Neanderthals, who also inhabited the entrance of the cave, are believed to have built it. A massive stone slab covered the top of the structure. At the cave entrance, seven bear skulls were arranged with their muzzles facing the cave entrance, while deeper in the cave, a further six bear skulls were lodged in niches along the wall. Next to these remains were bundles of limb bones belonging to different bears. Consequently, it was at this site that the supposed symbol of the &quot; Cult of the Cave Bear &quot; was found. This consisted of the skull of a three-year-old bear pierced in the cheek by the leg-bone of a younger bear. The arrangement of these bones of different bears are not believed to have happened by chance. A similar phenomenon was encountered in Regourdou, southern France. A rectangular pit contained the remains of at least twenty bears, covered by a massive stone slab. The remains of a Neanderthal lay nearby in another stone pit, with various objects, including a bear humerus, a scraper, a core, and some flakes, which were interpreted as grave offerings. The unusual finding in a deep chamber of Basua Cave in Savona, Italy, is thought to be related to cave bear worship, as there is a vaguely zoomorphic stalagmite surrounded by clay pellets. It was apparently used by Neanderthals for a ceremony; the fact that bear bones lay scattered on the floor further suggests that this was likely to have had some sort of ritual purpose.
