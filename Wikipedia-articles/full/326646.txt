[ Childhood ] William Vanderbilt was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey { Cornelius Vanderbilt and his children, in 1911 Britannica } in 1821. He inherited nearly $100 million from his father, railroad mogul and family patriarch &quot; The Commodore &quot; Cornelius Vanderbilt upon his death in 1877 and had increased it to almost $194 million at his death less than nine years later. When he died, he was the richest man in the world. In 1841 he married Maria Louisa Kissam (1821–1896), the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. Vanderbilt said in an interview with the Chicago Daily News on October 9, 1882, &quot; The railroads are not run for the benefit of the &apos;dear public&apos; — that cry is all nonsense — they are built by men who invest their money and expect to get a fair percentage on the same. &quot; [ April 2012 ] In 1883, when questioned by a reporter about the discontinuance of a fast mail train popular with the public, he declared: &quot; The public be damned!... I don&apos;t take any stock in this silly nonsense about working for anybody but our own. &quot; {Interview, Chicago Daily News, October 9, 1882} His father Cornelius constantly berated and criticized him, calling his eldest son a &quot; blockhead &quot; and a &quot; blatherskite &quot;. Billy (as he was called) longed to show his father that he was not, in fact, a blatherskite, but never dared stand up to the fearsome Commodore. [ Career ] William H.

His father carefully oversaw his business training, starting him out at age 19 as a clerk in a New York banking house. After joining the executive of the Staten Island Railway, he was made its president in 1862 then three years later was appointed vice-president of the Hudson River railway. In 1869, he was made vice-president of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, becoming its president in 1877. He took over for his father as president of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, the Canada Southern Railway, and the Michigan Central Railroad at the time of the Commodore&apos;s death. He actively expanded the family&apos;s railroad empire, and added millions to the gargantuan Vanderbilt family fortune. At his retirement in 1883, his elder sons assumed the head positions in the family railroad empire, and they inherited his massive fortune when he died. It was in his sons&apos; time that the Vanderbilt family demanded social recognition, [ January 2010 ] and obtained it with the efforts of his daughter-in-law Alva, from the older families of New York City high society, centered on the Astor family, whom the Vanderbilts had by then far outstripped in wealth.

The building was destroyed by fire in 1932 and his son Frederick made another donation to help cover the insurance shortfall and allow a new building to be constructed. Vanderbilt was an avid art enthusiast; his collection included some of the most valuable works of the Old Masters, and over his lifetime Vanderbilt acquired more than 200 paintings, which he housed in his lavish and palatial Fifth Avenue mansion. Despite his great wealth he never considered himself happy with it — shortly before his death he said: &quot; The care of $200 million is too great a load for any back or brain to bear. It is enough to kill anyone. There is no pleasure in it. &quot; [ January 2010 ] [ Death ] In 1883, he resigned all his company presidencies and had his sons appointed as important chairmen but left the day-to-day running of the businesses to experienced men appointed president.
