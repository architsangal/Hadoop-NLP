[ Objectivist philosophy Objectivism (disambiguation) ] Objectivism is a philosophy created by Russian-American philosopher and novelist Ayn Rand (1905–1982). Objectivism&apos;s central tenets are that reality exists independent of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one&apos;s life is the pursuit of one&apos;s own happiness (or rational self-interest ), that the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans&apos; metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally. Rand characterized Objectivism as &quot; a philosophy for living on earth, &quot; grounded in reality, and aimed at defining human nature and the nature of the world in which we live. [ Rand 1992 1170–1171 ] The name &quot; Objectivism &quot; derives from the idea that human knowledge and values are objective : they exist and are determined by the nature of reality, to be discovered by one&apos;s mind, and are not created by the thoughts one has. [ Rand 1967 23 ] Rand stated that she chose the name because her preferred term for a philosophy based on the primacy of existence — &quot; existentialism &quot; —had already been taken. [ Peikoff 1991 36 ] Rand originally expressed her philosophical ideas in her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and other works. She further elaborated on them in her periodicals The Objectivist Newsletter, The Objectivist, and The Ayn Rand Letter, and in non-fiction books such as Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology and The Virtue of Selfishness. [ Harriet Rubin Ayn Rand&apos;s Literature of Capitalism http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html The New York Times September 15, 2007 September 18, 2007 ] Objectivism has received generally negative reception from philosophers and been controversial since its inception. Common criticisms against Objectivism include that the philosophy is incomplete, contradicts itself, and engages in question begging. [ Philosophy ] [ Metaphysics: objective reality ] Rand&apos;s philosophy begins with three axiom s : existence, identity, and consciousness. [ Peikoff 1991 4–11 ] Rand defined an axiom as &quot; a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it. &quot; [ Rand 1992 1040 ] {. } As Objectivist philosopher Leonard Peikoff argued, Rand&apos;s argument for axioms &quot; is not a proof that the axioms of existence, consciousness, and identity are true. It is proof that they are axioms, that they are at the base of knowledge and thus inescapable. &quot; [ Peikoff 1991 11 ] Rand held that existence is the perceptually self-evident fact at the base of all other knowledge, i.e., that &quot; existence exists. &quot; She further held that to be is to be something, that &quot; existence is identity. &quot; That is, to be is to be &quot; an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes. &quot; That which has no nature or attributes does not and cannot exist. The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing, while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another, i.e., one&apos;s first awareness of the law of non-contradiction, another crucial base for the rest of knowledge. As Rand wrote, &quot; A leaf... cannot be all red and green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the same time... A is A. &quot; [ Rand 1992 1016 ] {. } Objectivism rejects belief in any thing alleged to transcend existence. [ Peikoff 1991 31–33 ] Rand argues that consciousness, &quot; the faculty of perceiving that which exists, &quot; is an inherently relational phenomenon. As she puts it, &quot; to be conscious is to be conscious of something &quot;, that is consciousness itself cannot be distinguished or grasped except in relation to an independent reality. [ Peikoff 1991 5 ] &quot; It cannot be aware only of itself—there is no &apos;itself&apos; until it is aware of something. &quot; [ Gotthelf 2000 ] Thus, Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality, but rather, it is a means of discovering reality. [ Rand 1990 ] Expressed differently, existence has &quot; primacy &quot; over consciousness, which must conform to it. Any other approach Rand termed &quot; the primacy of consciousness &quot;, including any variant of metaphysical subjectivism or theism. [ Rand 1982 24–28 ] Objectivist philosophy derives its explanations of action and causation from the axiom of identity, calling causation &quot; the law of identity applied to action. &quot; [ Rand 1992 1037 ] According to Rand, it is entities that act, and every action is the action of an entity. The way entities act is caused by the specific nature (or &quot; identity &quot; ) of those entities; if they were different they would act differently. As with the other axioms, an implicit understanding of causation is derived from one&apos;s primary observations of causal connections among entities even before it is verbally identified, and serves as the basis of further knowledge. [ Peikoff 1991 14 ] [ Epistemology: reason ] Objectivist epistemology begins with the principle that &quot; consciousness is identification &quot;. This is understood to be a direct consequence of the metaphysical principle that &quot; existence is identity. &quot; [ Rand 1961 124 ] Rand defined &quot; reason &quot; as &quot; the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man&apos;s senses. &quot; [ Rand 1964 22 ] Objectivist epistemology maintains that all knowledge is ultimately based on perception. &quot; Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident. &quot; [ Rand 1990 5 ] Rand considered the validity of the senses to be axiomatic, and claimed that purported arguments to the contrary all commit the fallacy of the &quot; stolen concept &quot; [ Branden Nathaniel 1963 January The Stolen Concept The Objectivist Newsletter 2 1 2, 4 harv ] by presupposing the validity of concepts that, in turn, presuppose the validity of the senses. [ Rand 1990 3 ] She held that perception, being physiologically determined, is incapable of error. For example, Optical illusions are errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen, not errors in sight itself. [ Kelley 1986 ] The validity of sense perception, therefore, is not susceptible to proof (because it is presupposed by all proof as proof is only a matter of adducing sensory evidence) nor should its validity be denied (since the conceptual tools one would have to use to do this are derived from sensory data). Perceptual error, therefore, is not possible. Rand consequently rejected epistemological skepticism, as she holds that the skeptics&apos; claim to knowledge &quot; undistorted &quot; by the form or the means of perception is impossible. The Objectivist theory of perception distinguishes between the form and object. The form in which an organism perceives is determined by the physiology of its sensory systems. Whatever form the organism perceives it in, what it perceives—the object of perception—is reality. { Kelley (1986); } [ Peikoff 1991 44–48 ] Rand consequently rejected the Kantian dichotomy between &quot; things as we perceive them &quot; and &quot; things as they are in themselves. &quot; Says Rand, &quot; The attack on man&apos;s consciousness and particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallenged premise that any knowledge acquired by a process of consciousness is necessarily subjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is &quot; processed knowledge...[but] all knowledge is processed knowledge—whether on the sensory, perceptual or conceptual level. An &quot; unprocessed &quot; knowledge would be a knowledge acquired without means of cognition. [ Rand 1990 81 ] Says Rand, &quot; The fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the others depend, is logic. The distinguishing characteristic of logic (the art of non-contradictory identification) indicates the nature of the actions (actions of consciousness required to achieve a correct identification) and their goal (knowledge)—while omitting the length, complexity or specific steps of the process of logical inference, as well as the nature of the particular cognitive problem involved in any given instance of using logic. &quot; [ Rand 1990 36 ] According to Rand, attaining knowledge beyond what is given in perception requires both volition (or the exercise of free will) and adherence to a specific method of validation through observation, concept-formation, and the application of inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. For example, belief in dragons, however sincere, does not mean reality contains any dragons. A process of proof identifying the basis in reality of a claimed item of knowledge is necessary to establish its truth. [ Peikoff 1991 116–121 ] According to Rand, consciousness possesses a specific and finite identity, just like everything else that exists; therefore, it must operate by a specific method of validation. An item of knowledge cannot be &quot; disqualified &quot; by being arrived at by a specific process in a particular form. Thus, for Rand, the fact that consciousness must itself possess identity implies the rejection of both universal skepticism based on the &quot; limits &quot; of consciousness and any claim to revelation, emotion or faith based belief. Rand rejected &quot; feeling &quot; as sources of knowledge. Rand acknowledged the importance of emotion for human beings, but she maintained that emotions are a consequence of the conscious or subconscious ideas that a person already accepts, not a means of achieving awareness of reality. &quot; Emotions are not tools of cognition. &quot; [ Rand 1961 64 ] Rand also rejected all forms of faith or mysticism, terms that she used synonymously. She defined faith as &quot; the acceptance of allegations without evidence or proof, either apart from or against the evidence of one&apos;s senses and reason... Mysticism is the claim to some non-sensory, non-rational, non-definable, non-identifiable means of knowledge, such as &apos;instinct,&apos; &apos;intuition,&apos; &apos;revelation,&apos; or any form of &apos;just knowing.&apos; &quot; [ Rand 1982 62–63 ] Reliance on revelation is like reliance on a Ouija board; it bypasses the need to show how it connects its results to reality. Faith, for Rand, is not a &quot; short-cut &quot; to knowledge, but a &quot; short-circuit &quot; destroying it. [ Rand 1961 223 ] {; } [ Peikoff 1991 182–185 ] The aspect of epistemology given the most elaboration by Rand is the theory of concept-formation, which she presented in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology. She argued that concepts are formed by a process of measurement omission. Peikoff described her view as follows: To form a concept, one mentally isolates a group of concretes (of distinct perceptual units), on the basis of observed similarities which distinguish them from all other known concretes (similarity is &apos;the relationship between two or more existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure or degree&apos;); then, by a process of omitting the particular measurements of these concretes, one integrates them into a single new mental unit: the concept, which subsumes all concretes of this kind (a potentially unlimited number). The integration is completed and retained by the selection of a perceptual symbol (a word) to designate it. &apos;A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.&apos; &quot; { Peikoff, Leonard. &quot; The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy. &quot; in } [ Rand 1990 97–98 ] {. The quotes within this passage are of Rand&apos;s material elsewhere in the same book. } According to Rand, &quot; [T]he term &apos;measurements omitted&apos; does not mean, in this context, that measurements are regarded as non-existent; it means that measurements exist, but are not specified. That measurements must exist is an essential part of the process. The principle is: the relevant measurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity. &quot; [ Rand 1990 12 ] {; for more on Rand&apos;s theory of concepts see also Kelley, David &quot; A Theory of Abstraction &quot; and &quot; The Psychology of Abstraction &quot;, Cognition and Brain Theory vol. vii, no. 3 and 4 (Summer/Fall 1984), and Rasmussen, Douglas B., &quot; Quine and Aristotelian Essentialism, &quot; The New Scholasticism 58 (Summer, 1984) } Rand argued that concepts are hierarchically organized. Concepts such as &apos;dog,&apos; which bring together &quot; concretes &quot; available in perception, can be differentiated (into the concepts of &apos;dachshund,&apos; &apos;poodle,&apos; etc.) or integrated (along with &apos;cat,&apos; etc., into the concept of &apos;animal&apos;). Abstract concepts such as &apos;animal&apos; can be further integrated, via &quot; abstraction from abstractions &quot;, into such concepts as &apos;living thing.&apos; Concepts are formed in the context of knowledge available. A young child differentiates dogs from cats and chickens, but need not explicitly differentiate them from deep-sea tube worms, or from other types of animals not yet known to him, to form a concept &apos;dog.&apos; [ Rand 1990 15–28 ] Because of its view of concepts as &quot; open-ended &quot; classifications that go well beyond the characteristics included in their past or current definitions, Objectivist epistemology rejects the analytic-synthetic distinction as a false dichotomy { Peikoff, Leonard. &quot; The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy, &quot; in } [ Rand 1990 94 ] and denies the possibility of a priori knowledge. { Peikoff, Leonard. &quot; The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy &quot;. in } [ Rand 1990 116–118 ] Objectivist acknowledges the facts that human beings have limited knowledge, are vulnerable to error, and do not instantly understand all of the implications of their knowledge. { Lecture by Leonard Peikoff, cited in } [ Sciabarra 1995 ] {. } According to Peikoff, one can be certain of a proposition if all of the available evidence supports it, i.e., it can be logically integrated with the rest of one&apos;s knowledge; one is then certain within the context of the evidence. [ Peikoff 1991 171–181 ] Objectivism therefore rejects naïve realism. Rand rejected the traditional rationalist / empiricist dichotomy, arguing that it embodies a false alternative: conceptually-based knowledge independent of perception (rationalism) versus perceptually-based knowledge independent of concepts (empiricism). Rand argued that neither is possible because the senses provide the material of knowledge while conceptual processing is also needed to establish knowable propositions. [ Criticisms ] Some philosophers, such as Tibor Machan, have argued that the Objectivist epistemology is incomplete. { For example, } [ Machan 2000 134–151 ] Psychology professor Robert L. Campbell says the relationship between Objectivist epistemology and cognitive science remains unclear because Rand made claims about human cognition and its development which belong to psychology, yet Rand also argued that philosophy is logically prior to psychology and in no way dependent on it. [ Rand 1990 289 ] [ Campbell R. L. 1999 Fall Ayn Rand and the Cognitive Revolution in Psychology Journal of Ayn Rand Studies 1 1 107–134 http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~campber/randcogrev.html ] Philosophers Randall Dipert and Roderick Long have argued that Objectivist epistemology conflates the perceptual process by which judgments are formed with the way in which they are to be justified, thereby leaving it unclear how judgments with propositional structure can be validated by sensory data. { Dipert, R., 1987, ‘David Kelley&apos;s Evidence of the Senses: A Realist Theory of Perception’, Reason Papers 12: 57–70 } { &apos;Reason and Value: Aristotle versus Rand, with Commentaries by Fred D. Miller, Jr. and Eyal Moses, and a Reply by Long&apos;, Poughkeepsie: Objectivist Center } [ Ethics: self-interest ] Objectivism includes an extensive treatment of ethical concerns. Ayn Rand wrote on morality in her works The Virtue of Selfishness and Atlas Shrugged. Rand defines morality as &quot; a code of values to guide man&apos;s choices and actions—the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life. &quot; [ Rand 1964 13 ] {. } Rand maintained that the first question isn&apos;t what should the code of values be, the first question is &quot; Does man need values at all—and why? &quot; According to Rand, &quot; it is only the concept of &apos;Life&apos; that makes the concept of &apos;Value&apos; possible, &quot; and, &quot; the fact that a living entity is, determines what it ought to do. &quot;. [ Rand 1964 18 ] {; for more on Rand&apos;s metaethics see } [ Binswanger 1990 58–66 ] {, } [ Smith 2000 ] { and } [ Gotthelf Lennox 2010 ] Rand writes: &quot; there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action... It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death... &quot; The survival of the organism is the ultimate value to which all of the organism&apos;s activities are aimed, the end served by all of its lesser values. Rand argued that the primary focus of man&apos;s free will is in the choice: &apos;to think or not to think&apos;. &quot; Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one&apos;s consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make. &quot; [ Rand 1964 22 ] {; for more on Rand&apos;s theory of volition, see } [ Binswanger Harry Harry Binswanger Volition as Cognitive Self-Regulation Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 50 2 December 1991 154–178 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90019-P harv ] {; } [ The Psychology of Self-Esteem Man: A Being of Volitional Consciousness Branden Nathaniel Nathaniel Branden Los Angeles Nash Publishing 1969 0-8402-1109-0 ] {; and } [ Peikoff 1991 55–72 ] {. } According to Rand, therefore, possessing free will, human beings must choose their values: one does not automatically hold one&apos;s own life as his ultimate value. Whether in fact a person&apos;s actions promote and fulfill his own life or not is a question of fact, as it is with all other organisms, but whether a person will act to promote his well-being is up to him, not hard-wired into his physiology. &quot; Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history. &quot; [ Rand 1992 1013 ] Says Rand, &quot; Man&apos;s mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive he must act and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch––or build a cyclotron––without a knowledge of his aim and the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think. &quot; [ Rand 1992 1012 ] In her novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, she also emphasizes the central importance of productive work, romantic love and art to human happiness, and dramatizes the ethical character of their pursuit. The primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is rationality, as Rand meant it &quot; the recognition and acceptance of reason as one&apos;s only source of knowledge, one&apos;s only judge of values and one&apos;s only guide to action. &quot; [ Rand 1964 25 ] {; } [ Smith 2006 7 ] The purpose of a moral code, Rand held, is to provide the principles by reference to which man can achieve the values his survival requires. [ Peikoff Leonard Why Should One Act on Principle? The Intellectual Activist February 27, 1989 4 20 harv ] Rand summarizes: If [man] chooses to live, a rational ethics will tell him what principles of action are required to implement his choice. If he does not choose to live, nature will take its course. Reality confronts a man with a great many &apos;must&apos;s&apos;, but all of them are conditional: the formula of realistic necessity is: &apos;you must, if -&apos; and the if stands for man&apos;s choice: &apos;if you want to achieve a certain goal&apos;. [ Rand 1982 118–119 ] Rand&apos;s explanation of values presents the view that an individual&apos;s primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well-being—it is for his life and his self-interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code. [ Smith 2006 23–24 ] Egoism is a corollary of setting man&apos;s life as the moral standard. [ Peikoff 1991 230 ] Rand believed that egoism was the logical consequence of humans following evidence wherever it leads them. The only alternative would be that they live without orientation to reality. A corollary to Rand&apos;s endorsement of self-interest is her rejection of the ethical doctrine of altruism —which she defined in the sense of Auguste Comte&apos;s altruism (he coined the term), as a moral obligation to live for the sake of others. Rand also rejected subjectivism. A &quot; whim-worshiper &quot; or &quot; hedonist, &quot; according to Rand, is not motivated by a desire to live his own human life, but by a wish to live on a sub-human level. Instead of using &quot; that which promotes my (human) life &quot; as his standard of value, he mistakes &quot; that which I (mindlessly happen to) value &quot; for a standard of value, in contradiction of the fact that, existentially, he is a human and therefore rational organism. The &quot; I value &quot; in whim-worship or hedonism can be replaced with &quot; we value, &quot; &quot; he values, &quot; &quot; they value, &quot; or &quot; God values, &quot; and still it would remain dissociated from reality. Rand repudiated the equation of rational selfishness with hedonistic or whim-worshiping &quot; selfishness-without-a-self. &quot; She held that the former is good, and the latter evil, and that there is a fundamental difference between them. [ Rand 1964 18 ] For Rand, all of the principal virtues are applications of the role of reason as man&apos;s basic tool of survival: rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, productiveness, and pride—each of which she explains in some detail in &quot; The Objectivist Ethics. &quot; { See also } [ Smith 2006 ] The essence of Objectivist ethics is summarized by the oath her Atlas Shrugged character John Galt adhered to: I swear—by my life and my love of it—that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine. [ Criticisms ] Many philosophers have criticized Objectivist ethics. Philosopher Robert Nozick argues that Rand&apos;s foundational argument in ethics is unsound because she does not explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values. He argues that her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is, therefore, an instance of begging the question. Nozick also argues that Rand&apos;s solution to David Hume &apos;s famous is-ought problem is unsatisfactory. In response, philosophers Douglas Rasmussen and Douglas Den Uyl have argued that Nozick misstated Rand&apos;s case. [ Ayn Rand and the Is-Ought Problem O&apos;Neil Patrick M.

Blair defended Rand&apos;s ethical conclusions, while maintaining that his arguments might not have been approved by Rand.

Blair Reason Papers Spring 1985 10 September 14, 2011 ] [ Politics: individual rights and capitalism ] Rand&apos;s defense of individual liberty integrates elements from her entire philosophy. [ Peikoff 1991 354 ] {; } [ Sciabarra 1995 274 ] Since reason is the means of human knowledge, it is therefore each person&apos;s most fundamental means of survival and is necessary to the achievement of values. [ Bernstein 2009 25–31 ] The use or threat of force neutralizes the practical effect of an individual&apos;s reason, whether the force originates from the state or from a criminal. According to Rand, &quot; man&apos;s mind will not function at the point of a gun. &quot; [ Rand 1967 141 ] Therefore, the only type of organized human behavior consistent with the operation of reason is that of voluntary cooperation. Persuasion is the method of reason. By its nature, the overtly irrational cannot rely on the use of persuasion and must ultimately resort to force to prevail. [ Peikoff 1991 310–313 ] Thus, Rand saw reason and freedom as correlates, just as she saw mysticism and force as corollaries. [ Rand 1982 66 ] Based on this understanding of the role of reason, Objectivists hold that the initiation of physical force against the will of another is immoral, [ Rand 1964 36 ] {; } [ Peikoff 1991 310 ] {; } [ Smith 1997 143–147 ] as are indirect initiations of force through threats, [ Smith 1997 150–155 ] fraud, [ Peikoff 1991 319 ] or breach of contract. [ Rand 1964 129–130 ] The use of defensive or retaliatory force, on the other hand, is appropriate. [ Rand 1964 126 ] {; } [ Peikoff 1991 320 ] Objectivism holds that because the opportunity to use reason without the initiation of force is necessary to achieve moral values, each individual has an inalienable moral right to act as his own judgment directs and to keep the product of his effort. Peikoff, explaining the basis of rights, stated, &quot; In content, as the founding fathers recognized, there is one fundamental right, which has several major derivatives. The fundamental right is the right to life. Its major derivatives are the right to liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. &quot; [ Peikoff 1991 351–352 ] {. The Objectivist understanding of rights is explored at length in } [ Smith 1997 ] {. } &quot; A &apos;right&apos; is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man&apos;s freedom of action in a social context. &quot; [ Rand 1964 110 ] These rights are specifically understood to be rights to action, not to specific results or objects, and the obligations created by rights are negative in nature: each individual must refrain from violating the rights of others. [ Peikoff 1991 355 ] Objectivists reject alternative notions of rights, such as positive rights, [ Smith 1997 165–182 ] {; cf. } [ Then Athena Said: Unilateral Transfers and the Transformation of Objectivist Ethics Touchstone Kathleen Lanham, Maryland University Press of America 2006 0-7618-3519-9 108 ] collective rights, or animal rights. [ Peikoff 1991 356–358 ] {; } [ Rand 1964 120 ] Objectivism holds that the only social system which fully recognizes individual rights is capitalism, [ Rand 1967 19 ] specifically what Rand described as &quot; full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism. &quot; [ Rand 1964 37 ] Objectivism regards capitalism as the social system which is most beneficial to the poor, but that this isn&apos;t its primary justification. [ Peikoff 1991 392–395 ] {; } [ Sciabarra 1995 284 ] Rather, it is the only moral social system. Objectivism maintains that only societies seeking to establish freedom (or free nations) have a right to self-determination. [ Rand 1964 103 ] Objectivism views government as &quot; the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws; &quot; thus, government is both legitimate and critically important [ Peikoff 1991 364 ] in order to protect individual rights. [ Rand 1964 125–128 ] Rand opposed so-called &quot; rational anarchism, &quot; because she saw putting police and courts on the market as an inherent miscarriage of justice. Objectivism holds that the proper functions of a government are &quot; the police, to protect men from criminals— the armed services, to protect men from foreign invaders— the law courts, to settle disputes among men according to objectively defined laws, &quot; the executive, and legislatures. [ Rand 1964 131 ] Furthermore, in protecting individual rights, the government is acting as an agent of its citizens and &quot; has no rights except the rights delegated to it by the citizens &quot; [ Rand 1964 129 ] and it must act in an impartial manner according to specific, objectively defined laws. [ Rand 1964 128 ] {; } [ Peikoff 1991 364–365 ] Prominent Objectivists Leonard Peikoff and Yaron Brook have since expressed support for other government functions. { http://www.peikoff.com/2011/03/07/what-role-should-certain-specific-governments-play-in-objectivist-government/ } { http://www.peikoff.com/2011/10/03/interview-with-yaron-brook-on-economic-issues-in-todays-world-part-1/ } Rand argued that limited intellectual property monopolies being granted to certain inventors and artists on a first-to-file basis as moral because she viewed all property as fundamentally intellectual. Furthermore, the value of a commercial product comes in part from the necessary work of its inventors. However, Rand viewed limits on patents and copyrights as important and held that if they were granted in perpetuity, it would necessarily lead to de facto collectivism. Rand opposed racism and any legal application of racism. She considered affirmative action to be an example of legal racism. [ Rand 1964 173–184 ] {; cf. } [ The Other Side of Racism Wortham Anne Columbus, Ohio Ohio State University Press 1981 0-8142-0318-3 ] Rand advocated the right to legal abortion.

Barry, and Chandran Kukathas, have argued that Objectivist ethics are consistent with anarcho-capitalism instead of minarchism. { Childs, Roy (1969). &quot; Objectivism and The State: An Open Letter to Ayn Rand &quot; } [ Barry 1987 128–129 ] [ Burns 2009 250–251 ] [ Aesthetics: metaphysical value-judgments ] [ Romantic realism ] The Objectivist theory of art flows from its epistemology, by way of &quot; psycho-epistemology &quot; (Rand&apos;s term for an individual&apos;s characteristic mode of functioning in acquiring knowledge). Art, according to Objectivism, serves a human cognitive need: it allows human beings to grasp concepts as though they were percept s. Objectivism defines &quot; art &quot; as a &quot; selective re-creation of reality according to an artist&apos;s metaphysical value-judgments &quot; —that is, according to what the artist believes to be ultimately true and important about the nature of reality and humanity. In this respect Objectivism regards art as a way of presenting abstractions concretely, in perceptual form. [ Peikoff 1991 417 ] The human need for art, on this view, stems from the need for cognitive economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for a large number of concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers a way out of this dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one&apos;s metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal. [ Peikoff 1991 422 ] Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist&apos;s sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional). [ Peikoff 1991 426 ] Rand held that Romanticism was the highest school of literary art, noting that Romanticism was &quot; based on the recognition of the principle that man possesses the faculty of volition, &quot; absent which, Rand believed, literature is robbed of dramatic power, adding: [ Rand 1971 ] What the Romanticists brought to art was the primacy of values… Values are the source of emotions: a great deal of emotional intensity was projected in the work of the Romanticists and in the reactions of their audiences, as well as a great deal of color, imagination, originality, excitement, and all the other consequences of a value-oriented view of life. &quot; What is Romanticism? &quot; in The term &quot; romanticism, &quot; however, is often affiliated with emotionalism, to which Objectivism is completely opposed. Historically, many romantic artists were philosophically subjectivist. Most Objectivists who are also artists subscribe to what they call romantic realism, which is how Rand labeled her own work. { See also, Thomas, William, edit., The Literary Art of Ayn Rand, The Objectivist Center, 2005.

In 1991, prominent Objectivist Leonard Peikoff published Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, a comprehensive exposition of Rand&apos;s philosophy. Chris Matthew Sciabarra discusses Rand&apos;s ideas and theorizes about their intellectual origins in Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical (1995). Surveys such as On Ayn Rand by Allan Gotthelf (1999), Ayn Rand by Tibor R. Machan (2000), and Objectivism in One Lesson by Andrew Bernstein (2009) provide briefer introductions to Rand&apos;s ideas. Some scholars have focused on applying Objectivism in more specific areas. Machan has developed Rand&apos;s contextual conception of human knowledge (while also drawing on the insights of J. L. Austin and Gilbert Harman ) in works such as Objectivity (2004), and David Kelley has explicated Rand&apos;s epistemological ideas in works such as The Evidence of the Senses (1986) and A Theory of Abstraction (2001). In the field of ethics, Kelley has argued in works such as Unrugged Individualism (1996) and The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand (2000) that Objectivists should pay more attention to the virtue of benevolence and place less emphasis on issues of moral sanction. Kelley&apos;s views have been controversial, with critics arguing that he contradicts important principles of Objectivism.

Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics by George Reisman (1996) attempts to integrate Objectivist methodology and insights with both Classical and Austrian economics. In psychology, Professor Edwin A. Locke and Ellen Kenner have explored Rand&apos;s ideas in The Selfish Path to Romance: How to Love with Passion &amp; Reason. { Locke, Edwin, and Kenner, Ellen, Platform, 2011 } Other writers have explored the application of Objectivism to fields ranging from art, as in What Art Is by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kamhi (2000), to teleology, as in The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts by Harry Binswanger (1990).
