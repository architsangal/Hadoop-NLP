The population was 1,085 at the 2000 census. The village is located along the Mississippi River within the Town of Cassville. [ History ] Cassville was first settled in 1827 and was named for Lewis Cass, governor of Michigan Territory at the time. After the creation of Wisconsin Territory in 1836, Cassville was viewed by many as a likely candidate to be the territorial capital, owing to its central location in a territory that stretched from Lake Michigan to the Missouri River. Land speculators built up the site, but the city of Madison, Wisconsin was selected as capital instead. This caused Cassville&apos;s developers to go bankrupt. Eventually Nelson Dewey, who had moved to Cassville in 1836 and later served as the first Governor of Wisconsin, bought up most of the village. Hoping to profit from this, he encouraged settlement at the site to turn Cassville into a metropolis. In the meantime, Dewey was able to establish a large estate for himself outside the city. The estate, which he named Stonefield, is now a state historic site. Dewey himself was unable to occupy it for long. A fire destroyed his home in 1873, and financial misfortune forced him to sell the property shortly later. Cassville never became the major city that Dewey had envisioned. Today the city is primarily known for the Stonefield Historic Site, Nelson Dewey State Park, and the Cassville Ferry, which runs between Cassville and a nearby landing in Iowa. Throughout the American Civil War, 110 men from Cassville volunteered to serve the Union in the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 17th, 20th, 25th, 31st, 33rd, 35th, 42nd, 43rd, 45th, and 49th Regiments of Wisconsin Infantry, the 2nd and 3rd Regiments of Wisconsin Cavalry, the 1st Regiment of Wisconsin Heavy Artillery, the 12th Regiment of Illinois Infantry, the 12th Regiment of Iowa Infantry, and the 6th Regiment of California Infantry. Out of these 110 men, 20 were killed or died of disease or wounds, 21 were wounded, and 2 were captured. The Steamboat era saw the foot of Frederic Street as the activity center of Cassville. Riverboats moored along the riverfront to unload goods, transfer passengers, and load lead from nearby mines. Riverside Park was established in the 1890&apos;s. An eagle effigy mound found here was built by Native Americans around 1000 A.D. [ Economy ] The Nelson Dewey Generating Station and the E. J. Stoneman Generating Station are in Cassville.
