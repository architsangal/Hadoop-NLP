He was gold medal ist in the 800 metres at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, U.S.S.R., and set world records for 1500 metres and the mile run. To this day, he holds the UK record for [ 2 mi m 0 ], which he set in 1978. [ Early life ] Born in Brighton, Sussex, and educated at Varndean School, Ovett was a talented teenage athlete. As a youngster, he showed great promise as a football er, but gave it up for athletics, because he did not want to do a sport where he would have to rely on teammates. [ August 2009 ] [ Athletics career ] [ Early promise ] His first major athletics title came in 1973, when he won the European junior 800m, followed the next year in Rome with a silver in the senior event. He won AAA titles in the 800m from 1974 to 1976, in the 1500m in 1979 and in the mile in 1980. At age 18, he won the silver medal at 800 metres in the 1974 European Athletics Championships, setting a new European Junior 800m record of 1:45.77 in the process. [ Butcher Pat The Perfect Distance: Ovett and Coe - The Record Breaking Rivalry 2005 Phoenix Press 0-7538-1900-7 ] [ http://www.uka.org.uk/e-inspire/hall-of-fame-athletes/steve-ovett/ UKA Steve Ovett Uka.org.uk 2011-09-03 ] Ovett gained some Olympic experience in 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada when he ran in the final of the 800m and was placed fifth, behind winner Alberto Juantorena of Cuba. Ovett finished fifth because he ran the first lap too slowly. He failed to reach the 1500 m final, having been obstructed in the semi-final. [ March 2011 ] He gained prominence in 1977 when, at the inaugural IAAF World Cup in Athletics, he commenced a &quot; kick &quot; with 200m to go, running the final turn in 11.8 s and the last 200m in 25.1 s. He left Olympic 1500-metres-champion John Walker, and the rest of the field behind. Walker was so astonished by Ovett&apos;s kick, that he dropped out of the race with 120 metres to go. [ March 2011 ] He won gold ahead of his good friend, West German Thomas Wessinghage. As Ovett raced away from the field, Ron Pickering, commenting for the race on BBC Television, said &quot; and there&apos;s one man&apos;s blazing speed, that has torn this field asunder &quot;. [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D0W7GogWlv7Q%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dresults_video%26amp%3Bplaynext%3D1%26amp%3Blist%3DPL35F358CD63F0A1AE 1977 World Cup 1500m - Steve Ovett YouTube 2012-05-24 ] The British public by now showed a keen interest in Ovett, and it was at the European Championships in 1978, that he raced against Sebastian Coe for the first time in their senior careers, beginning a rivalry that would become newsworthy. He led Coe in the 800m and appeared to be on his way to gold, before being surprisingly caught by the East German Olaf Beyer. After the fall of the GDR, Beyer&apos;s name would be found in the Stasi files of athletes alleged to have doped. [ March 2011 ] His time of 1:44:09 turned out to be his fastest ever 800m run. Coe finished 3rd. At the time the British press reported that Coe and Ovett had clashed after the race but Coe later revealed: “When Steve came over, he put his hand on my shoulder and said something. The media thought we were having a row, but what Steve actually said was, &apos;Who the **** was that&apos;? &quot; { http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article616564.ece } Ovett recovered to win the gold medal in the 1500m, in which Coe did not participate. In that race, Ovett waved to the crowd on the home straight and clearly slowed down in the last metres and still won by a second from Ireland &apos;s Eamonn Coghlan. The 1978 season for Ovett was notable for the superb times recorded at disparate distances. He ran an 800m in 1:44.09 (world record at the time was Alberto Juantorena&apos;s 1:43.44) and set a 2-mile world&apos;s best with an 8:13.51 clocking, (an event the IAAF no longer recognised for record purposes), handing Track &amp; Field News Athlete of the Year Henry Rono one of his few losses in his remarkable record breaking season. It&apos;s been speculated that if he&apos;d spent that season preparing specifically &amp; repeatedly attempting to run fast times in pacemaker led Grand Prix races, he was capable of breaking the 1000m, 1500m, 1 mile &amp; 2000m world records that year, based on his 800m &amp; 2 mile times. [ August 2008 ] [ Middle distance domination with Coe ] Ovett arrived at the 1980 Moscow Olympics as favourite to take the 1500 m title, unbeaten over the 1500 m and mile for three years. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/apr/18/50-olympic-moments-coe-ovett-moscow-1980 50 stunning Olympic moments No23: Coe v Ovett, Moscow 1980 April 18, 2012 The Guardian Simon Burnton ] Earlier that month, he had established a new mile world record of 3:48.8 and two weeks later equalled Sebastian Coe &apos;s world record of 3:32.1 in the 1500 m. The Moscow Olympics marked only the second time that Ovett and Coe had met each other in international competition (the first being the 800 m in the 1978 European Championships) and there was huge media speculation over which would emerge as the greater. Ovett&apos;s participation in the 800 m would serve as a test for the 1500 m. In the 800 m final, Ovett was only in sixth place at the halfway mark, but pushed his way through the crowd to second place. Seventy metres from the finish, he shot into the lead and held off Coe to win by three metres. In the 1500 m, contested six days later, Coe won and Ovett had to settle for third place. More specifically, Ovett ran behind Coe&apos;s shoulder for quite a long time, but on the final bend he fell two metres behind Coe and could not get closer to Coe anymore. East Germany&apos;s Jürgen Straub, who had accelerated after 800 metres, held off Ovett for the silver medal. Though in 1980 Ovett had tied Coe&apos;s 1500 m world record of 3:32.1, new timing rules would come into effect in 1981, which would recognise records over 400 m to the hundredth of a second. This would have the effect of giving Coe sole possession of the record, as Coe ran 3:32.03 to Ovett&apos;s 3:32.09. However, Ovett avoided this unusual removal of a record via rule change by setting a new record later in 1980 of 3:31.36. During 1981, both Ovett and Coe were at their peak. They didn&apos;t meet in a race that year but exchanged world records in the mile three times during a 10-day period. Ovett suffered a famous upset in a 1500m race in Oslo that year. With Ovett and Coe so dominant and Coe not involved in the race, Ovett was hot favourite. During the race Tom Byers, who had been asked to act as a pacemaker set off quickly and the pack, mishearing the split times being announced and believing that they were going faster than they were, declined to follow his pace. As a result, by the start of the last lap Byers was leading by almost ten seconds and decided to finish the race. Ovett ran the last lap almost nine seconds quicker than Byers but finished second by 0.53s, later commenting &quot; We ran like a load of hacks. &quot; [ http://espn.go.com/moresports/columns/hollobaugh_jeff/69968.html ESPN.com - MORESPORTS - How low can Loroupe go? Espn.go.com 1999-09-21 2011-09-03 ] Ovett&apos;s 1982 season was wrecked by injury. When out training on the streets of Brighton in late 1981, he ran into some railings and badly twisted his knee. He had recovered by the spring of 1982, but further injuries hampered his progress. [ Later career ] He returned to action in 1983, although once again his season had been hampered by injuries, which resulted his not being selected for the 800 m at the World Championships in Helsinki. He was selected for the 1500 m, but ran a poor tactical race in the final and finished 4th, behind winner Steve Cram. He was yet to reach his peak for 1983, which followed with a 1500 m world record of 3:30.77 in Rieti. A few days later, he finished a close 2nd to Steve Cram in an epic mile race in Crystal Palace. In 1984, after a successful season of winter training in Australia, Ovett&apos;s progress was slightly hampered by minor injuries and bronchitis. He attempted to defend his 800 m title in the 1984 Olympic Games, but after arriving in Los Angeles he began to suffer from respiratory problems. He was unlucky to be drawn against eventual winner Joaquim Cruz in each of his two heats and also the semi-final, in which he only narrowly qualified for the final, lunging for the finish in 4th place and appearing to collapse over the line. He had run 1:44:81, his second fastest time at the distance. He recovered in time to make the final, but was clearly below his best, and finished eighth, after which he collapsed and spent two nights in hospital. Against the advice of his friends and doctors he returned to compete in the 1500 m. Running in fourth place at the beginning of the last lap of the final, Ovett dropped out. He later collapsed with chest pains and was taken away on a stretcher. His career then wound down, although in August 1986 he won the 5000 m in the Commonwealth Games at Edinburgh. However the following month, in the European Championships, he failed to finish in hot conditions, allowing Jack Buckner (GB) - whom Ovett had beaten in Edinburgh - to win the gold. In the 1987 World Athletics Championships, he finished a lacklustre tenth in the 5000-metres final. He then failed to make the 1988 Olympic team, and retired in 1991, a year after Sebastian Coe. [ Post retirement ] He has been a Track &amp; Field television commentator for the CBC since 1992. He now lives in Australia and was a part of the BBC &apos;s on-location commentary team for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 1987 a bronze statue of Steve Ovett was erected in Preston Park, Brighton. However, it was stolen in 2007, and has not yet been replaced. [ http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/1661635.heros_statue_stolen_from_park/ Athlete&apos;s statue stolen from park (From The Argus) Theargus.co.uk 2007-09-04 2011-09-03 ] [ http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5075784.Steve_Ovett_to_start_Brighton_Marathon/ Steve Ovett to start Brighton Marathon (From The Argus) Theargus.co.uk 2010-03-23 2011-09-03 ] There is now a street ( &quot; Ovett Gardens &quot; ) named after him in Gateshead. (All the streets on the new estate are named after sports personalities, usually with some link to Gateshead.) [ August 2009 ] His times, though still impressive by today&apos;s standards, are arguably not indicative of his true talent, as he preferred winning races to chasing after world records (though on occasion he did do the latter). [ March 2011 ] He was often content to wait on the shoulder of the leader until either the last 100 or 200 metres, at which point he would usually sprint past for victory. Nevertheless, the times he recorded over a wide range of distances were impressive, showing great versatility. They ranged from 47.5 and 1:44.09 in the 400/800 meters to 13:20.06 for 5000 meters on the track, while on the roads he ran 22:24 for 8k (Oxford, 1986), 28:16 for 10 K (London, 1983), and 1:05 for the half marathon (Dartford, 1977). During his career, Ovett was noted for the unusual range and timing of his races; shortly before the 1980 Olympics in 10 days he ran four events of four different lengths: a mile in Oslo, 800 metres in Gothenburg, 600m at Crystal Palace and 3,000m in Welwyn Garden City. In 1977 when an airline strike forced him to miss a scheduled event he signed up at the last minute for a half-marathon and won with ease, running a course more than four times as long as anything he had attempted in public before against the British marathon champion. [ Personal life ] During the Moscow Games, the British press zoned in on a signal Ovett had made to a TV camera in Moscow after his 800m win. It later transpired that the signal represented the letters ILY and were intended for his girlfriend, Rachel Waller (whom he later married but is now divorced from). This later led to a rift between Ovett and his parents, in particular his mother, who had remained a key figure in his career and had carefully managed the media&apos;s requests for his time (Ovett was still living at home). [ March 2011 ] Steve&apos;s brother, Nicholas Ovett, represented Great Britain at luge in the Winter Olympics of 1988 and 1992. { http://www.todor66.com/olim/1988w/Luge_Men_Singles.html } { http://www.todor66.com/olim/1992w/Luge_Men_Singles.html } Steve&apos;s younger sister, Susan Emma Warner, was a highly successful Green Bowler, gaining great success within the field at national standard. [ August 2009 ] Ovett&apos;s son Freddy has also shown promise as a middle distance runner, winning the Pan-Pacific 800m title.
