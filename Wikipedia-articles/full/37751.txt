The order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species. The earliest known turtles date from 215 million years ago, [ http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/dinos/Archelon.shtml Archelon-Enchanted Learning Software Enchantedlearning.com 2009-03-14 ] making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than lizard s, snake s and crocodile s. Of the many species alive today, some are highly endangered. Like other reptiles, turtles are ectotherm s —their internal temperature varies according to the ambient environment, commonly called cold-blooded. However, leatherback sea turtle s have noticeably higher body temperature than surrounding water because of their high metabolic rate. Like other amniote s (reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals), they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water. The largest turtles are aquatic. [ Anatomy and morphology ] { Chelonia mydas &apos;&apos; in } { Kona, } { Hawaii } The largest living chelonian is the leatherback sea turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea ), which reaches a shell length of [ 200 cm ft ] and can reach a weight of over [ 900 kg lb ]. Freshwater turtles are generally smaller, but with the largest species, the Asian softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii, a few individuals have been reported up to [ 200 cm ft ]. This dwarfs even the better-known alligator snapping turtle, the largest chelonian in North America, which attains a shell length of up to [ 80 cm ft ] and weighs as much as [ 113.4 kg lb ].

They became extinct at the same time as the appearance of man, and it is assumed humans hunted them for food. The only surviving giant tortoise s are on the Seychelles and Galápagos Islands, and can grow to over [ 130 cm in ] in length, and weigh about [ 300 kg lb ]. [ Michael J.

[ Head ] Most turtles that spend most of their lives on land have their eyes looking down at objects in front of them. Some aquatic turtles, such as snapping turtles and soft-shelled turtles, have eyes closer to the top of the head. These species of turtles can hide from predators in shallow water, where they lie entirely submerged except for their eyes and nostrils. Sea turtles possess glands near their eyes that produce salty tears that rid their body of excess salt taken in from the water they drink. Turtles are thought to have exceptional night vision due to the unusually large number of rod cell s in their retinas. Turtles have color vision with a wealth of cone subtypes with sensitivities ranging from the near ultraviolet (UV A) to red. Some land turtles have very poor pursuit movement abilities, which are normally reserved for predators that hunt quick moving prey, but carnivorous turtles are able to move their heads quickly to snap. Turtles have a rigid beak. Turtles use their jaw s to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. Herbivorous turtles have serrated-edged ridges that help them cut through tough plants. Turtles use their tongues to swallow food, but they cannot, unlike most reptiles, stick out their tongues to catch food. [ Shell ] [ Turtle shell ] The upper shell of the turtle is called the carapace. The lower shell that encases the belly is called the plastron. The carapace and plastron are joined together on the turtle&apos;s sides by bony structures called bridges. The inner layer of a turtle&apos;s shell is made up of about 60 bones that include portions of the backbone and the ribs, meaning the turtle cannot crawl out of its shell. In most turtles, the outer layer of the shell is covered by horny scales called scute s that are part of its outer skin, or epidermis. Scutes are made up of a fibrous protein called keratin that also makes up the scales of other reptiles. These scutes overlap the seams between the shell bones and add strength to the shell. Some turtles do not have horny scutes. For example, the leatherback sea turtle and the soft-shelled turtles have shells covered with leathery skin instead. The rigid shell means turtles cannot breathe as other reptiles do, by changing the volume of their chest cavity via expansion and contraction of the ribs. Instead, turtles breathe in two ways. First, they employ buccal pumping, pulling air into their mouth, then pushing it into the lungs via oscillations of the floor of the throat. Secondly, by contracting the abdominal muscles that cover the posterior opening of the shell, the internal volume of the shell increases, drawing air into the lungs, allowing these muscles to function in much the same way as the mammalian diaphragm. The shape of the shell gives helpful clues to how a turtle lives. Most tortoises have a large, dome-shaped shell that makes it difficult for predators to crush the shell between their jaws. One of the few exceptions is the African pancake tortoise, which has a flat, flexible shell that allows it to hide in rock crevices. Most aquatic turtles have flat, streamlined shells which aid in swimming and diving. American snapping turtles and musk turtles have small, cross-shaped plastrons that give them more efficient leg movement for walking along the bottom of ponds and streams. The color of a turtle&apos;s shell may vary. Shells are commonly colored brown, black, or olive green. In some species, shells may have red, orange, yellow, or grey markings and these markings are often spots, lines, or irregular blotches. One of the most colorful turtles is the eastern painted turtle which includes a yellow plastron and a black or olive shell with red markings around the rim. Tortoises, being land-based, have rather heavy shells. In contrast, aquatic and soft-shelled turtles have lighter shells that help them avoid sinking in water and swim faster with more agility. These lighter shells have large spaces called fontanelle s between the shell bones. The shells of leatherback sea turtles are extremely light because they lack scutes and contain many fontanelles. [ Skin and molting ] { Snapping turtle tail, Blue Hills Reservation, Massachusetts } As mentioned above, the outer layer of the shell is part of the skin; each scute (or plate) on the shell corresponds to a single modified scale. The remainder of the skin is composed of skin with much smaller scales, similar to the skin of other reptiles. Turtles do not molt their skins all at once, as snakes do, but continuously, in small pieces. When kept in aquaria, small sheets of dead skin can be seen in the water (often appearing to be a thin piece of plastic) having been sloughed off when the animal deliberately rubs itself against a piece of wood or stone. Tortoises also shed skin, but a lot of dead skin is allowed to accumulate into thick knobs and plates that provide protection to parts of the body outside the shell. By counting the rings formed by the stack of smaller, older scutes on top of the larger, newer ones, it is possible to estimate the age of a turtle, if one knows how many scutes are produced in a year. [ http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?articleid%3D2700 Anatomy and Diseases of the Shells of Turtles and Tortoises Peteducation.com 2009-03-14 ] This method is not very accurate, partly because growth rate is not constant, but also because some of the scutes eventually fall away from the shell. [ Limbs ] Terrestrial tortoises have short, sturdy feet. Tortoises are famous for moving slowly, in part because of their heavy, cumbersome shell, which restricts stride length. The amphibious turtles normally have limbs similar to those of tortoises, except the feet are webbed and often have long claw s. These turtles swim using all four feet in a way similar to the dog paddle, with the feet on the left and right side of the body alternately providing thrust. Large turtles tend to swim less than smaller ones, and the very big species, such as alligator snapping turtles, hardly swim at all, preferring to simply walk along the bottom of the river or lake. As well as webbed feet, turtles have very long claws, used to help them clamber onto riverbanks and floating logs, upon which they like to bask. Male turtles tend to have particularly long claws, and these appear to be used to stimulate the female while mating. While most turtles have webbed feet, some, such as the pig-nosed turtle, have true flippers, with the digits being fused into paddles and the claws being relatively small. These species swim in the same way as sea turtles (see below). Sea turtles are almost entirely aquatic and have flippers instead of feet. Sea turtles fly through the water, using the up-and-down motion of the front flippers to generate thrust; the back feet are not used for propulsion, but may be used as rudder s for steering. Compared with freshwater turtles, sea turtles have very limited mobility on land, and apart from the dash from the nest to the sea as hatchlings, male sea turtles normally never leave the sea. Females must come back onto land to lay eggs. They move very slowly and laboriously, dragging themselves forwards with their flippers. [ Ecology and life history ] Sea turtle swimming Although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater, all turtles and tortoises breathe air, and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs. They can also spend much of their lives on dry land. Aquatic respiration in Australian freshwater turtles is currently being studied. Some species have large cloaca l cavities that are lined with many finger-like projections. These projections, called papillae, have a rich blood supply, and increase the surface area of the cloaca. The turtles can take up dissolved oxygen from the water using these papillae, in much the same way that fish use gill s to respire. Turtles lay eggs, like other reptiles, which are slightly soft and leathery. The eggs of the largest species are spherical, while the eggs of the rest are elongated. Their albumen is white and contains a different protein from bird eggs, such that it will not coagulate when cooked. Turtle eggs prepared to eat consist mainly of yolk. In some species, temperature determines whether an egg develops into a male or a female : a higher temperature causes a female, a lower temperature causes a male. Large numbers of eggs are deposited in holes dug into mud or sand. They are then covered and left to incubate by themselves. When the turtles hatch, they squirm their way to the surface and head toward the water. There are no known species in which the mother cares for the young. Sea turtles lay their eggs on dry, sandy beaches. Immature sea turtles are not cared for by the adults. Turtles can take many years to reach breeding age, and in many cases breed every few years rather than annually. Researchers have recently discovered a turtle’s organs do not gradually break down or become less efficient over time, unlike most other animals. It was found that the liver, lungs, and kidneys of a centenarian turtle are virtually indistinguishable from those of its immature counterpart. This has inspired genetic researchers to begin examining the turtle genome for longevity genes. { All but Ageless, Turtles Face Their Biggest Threat: Humans } [ Systematics and evolution ] [ List of Testudines families ] { Odontochelys is the oldest known turtle genus } The first proto-turtles are believed to have existed in the late Triassic Period of the Mesozoic era, about 220 million years ago, and their shell, which has remained a remarkably stable body plan, is thought to have evolved from bony extensions of their backbones and broad ribs that expanded and grew together to form a complete shell that offered protection at every stage of its evolution, even when the bony component of the shell was not complete. This is supported by fossils of the freshwater Odontochelys semitestacea or &quot; half-shelled turtle with teeth &quot;, from the late Triassic, which have been found near Guangling [ June 2011 ] in southwest China. Odontochelys displays a complete bony plastron and an incomplete carapace, similar to an early stage of turtle embryonic development.

It was believed they are the only surviving branch of the ancient evolutionary grade Anapsid a, which includes groups such as procolophonid s, millerettid s, protorothyrids, and pareiasaur s. All anapsid skulls lack a temporal opening, while all other extant amniote s have temporal openings (although in mammal s the hole has become the zygomatic arch ). The millerettids, protorothyrids, and pareiasaurs became extinct in the late Permian period, and the procolophonoids during the Triassic. [ http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/anapsids/procolophonoidea.html Introduction to Procolophonoidea Ucmp.berkeley.edu 2009-03-14 ] However, it was later suggested the anapsid-like turtle skull may be due to reversion rather than to anapsid descent. More recent morphological phylogenetic studies with this in mind placed turtles firmly within diapsid s, slightly closer to Squamata than to Archosaur ia.

The genus species already had many advanced turtle traits, and thus probably had many millions of years of preceding turtle evolution and species in its ancestry. It did lack the ability to pull its head into its shell (and it had a long neck), and had a long, spiked tail ending in a club, a body form similar to that of ankylosaur s, resulting from convergent evolution. Turtles are divided into two extant suborders, the Cryptodira and the Pleurodira. The Cryptodira is the larger of the two groups and includes all the marine turtles, the terrestrial tortoises, and many of the freshwater turtles. The Pleurodira are sometimes known as the side-necked turtles, a reference to the way they withdraw their heads into their shells. This smaller group consists primarily of various freshwater turtles. A chart of the two extant Testudine suborders, extinct groups that existed within these two suborders are shown as well.

Precisely how these alternative names are used, if at all, depends on the type of English being used. [ http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-turtle.html San Diego Zoo&apos;s Animal Bytes: Turtle &amp; Tortoise September 12, 2011 ] British English normally describes these reptiles as turtles if they live in the sea; terrapins if they live in fresh or brackish water; or tortoises if they live on land. However, there are exceptions to this where American or Australian common names are in wide use, as with the Fly River turtle. American English tends to use the word turtle as a general term for all species. &quot; Tortoise &quot; is used for most land-dwelling species, including the family Testudinidae and box tortoise s. Oceanic species are usually referred to as sea turtles. The name &quot; terrapin &quot; is typically reserved only for the brackish water diamondback terrapin, Malaclemys terrapin; the word terrapin being derived from the Algonquian word for this animal. Australian English uses turtle for both the marine and freshwater species, but tortoise for the terrestrial species. To avoid confusion, the word &quot; chelonian &quot; is popular among veterinarians, scientists, and conservationists working with these animals as a catch-all name for any member of the superorder Chelonia, which includes all turtles, tortoises and terrapins living and extinct, as well as their immediate ancestors. It is based on the Ancient Greek word χελώνη, chelōnē; Modern Greek χελώνα, chelōna; meaning turtle/tortoise. [ May 2012 ] Some languages do not have this problem, as all of these are referred to by the same name. For example, in Spanish, the word &quot; tortuga &quot; is used for turtles, tortoises and terrapins, though the type they belong to is usually specified and added to the name, as &quot; marina &quot; for sea turtles, &quot; de río &quot;, for freshwater species and &quot; terrestre &quot; for tortoises.

Turtles face many threats, including habitat destruction, harvesting for consumption and pet trade.The high extinction risk for Asian species is primarily due to the long-term unsustainable exploitation of turtles and tortoises for consumption and traditional Chinese medicine, and to a lesser extent for the international pet trade. { The World’s 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles—2011 &quot; &quot;. } Efforts have been made by Chinese entrepreneurs to satisfy increasing demand for turtle meat as gourmet food and traditional medicine with farmed turtles, instead of wild-caught ones; according to a study published in 2007, over a thousand turtle farms operated in China. { &quot; Turtle farms threaten rare species, experts say &quot;.

Published Online: 25 Oct 2006 } In the words of the biologist George Amato, &quot; the amount and the volume of captured turtles... vacuumed up entire species from areas in Southeast Asia &quot;, even as biologists still did not know how many distinct turtle species live in the region. { A Conversation at the Museum of Natural History : filmmaker } { Eric Daniel Metzgar, the creator of the film } { The Chances of the World Changing, talks to } { George Amato, the director of conservation genetics at the } { American Museum of Natural History about turtle conservation and the relationship between evolution and extinction } About 75% of Asia&apos;s 90 tortoise and freshwater turtle species are estimated to have become threatened. Harvesting wild turtles is legal in a number of states in the USA. In one of these states, Florida, just a single seafood company in Fort Lauderdale was reported in 2008 as buying about 5,000 pounds of softshell turtle s a week. The harvesters (hunters) are paid about $2 a pound; some manage to catch as many as 30–40 turtles (500 pounds) on a good day. Some of the catch gets to the local restaurants, while most of it is exported to Asia. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimated in 2008 that around 3,000 pounds of softshell turtles were exported each week via Tampa International Airport. { &quot; China Gobbling Up Florida Turtles &quot;, By Craig Pittman, St. Petersburg Times. Published: Thursday, October 9, 2008 } Nonetheless, the great majority of turtles exported from the USA are farm raised. According to one estimate by the World Chelonian Trust, about 97% of 31.8 million animals harvested in the U.S. over a three-year period (November 4, 2002 – November 26, 2005) were exported. { Declared Turtle Trade From the United States – Totals } It has been estimated (presumably, over the same 2002–2005 period) that about 47% of the US turtle exports go to People&apos;s Republic of China (predominantly to Hong Kong ), another 20% to Taiwan, and 11% to Mexico. { Declared Turtle Trade From the United States – Destinations (Major destinations: 13,625,673 animals to Hong Kong, 1,365,687 to the rest of the PRC, 6,238,300 to Taiwan, 3,478,275 to Mexico, and 1,527,771 to Japan, 945,257 to Singapore, and 596,966 to Spain. } { Declared Turtle Trade From the United States – Observations } [ In culture ] [ Cultural depictions of turtles and tortoises ] [ On coins ] Greek drachma of Aegina.
