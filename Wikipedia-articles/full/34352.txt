Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country. It has been the capital since 1918, the thirteenth in the history of Armenia. The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by king Argishti I at the western extreme of the Ararat plain. [ Katsenelinboĭgen Aron The Soviet Union: Empire, Nation and Systems Transaction Publishers 1990 New Brunswick 143 0-88738-332-7 ] After World War I, Yerevan became the capital of the Democratic Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian Genocide settled in the area. The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century as Armenia became one of the fifteen republics in the Soviet Union. In fifty years, Yerevan was transformed from a town of a few thousand residents within the Russian Empire, to Armenia&apos;s principal cultural, artistic, and industrial center, as well as becoming the seat of national government. With the growth of the economy of the country, Yerevan has been undergoing major transformation as many parts of the city have been the recipient of new construction since the early 2000s, and retail outlets such as restaurants, shops and street cafes, which were rare during Soviet times, have multiplied. As of 2011 estimates, the population of Yerevan was 1,121,900 people making up to 34% of the total population of Armenia. [ 34.4 % of Armenia’s population resides in Yerevan http://news.am/eng/news/26950.html 22 October 2011 News.am 4 August 2010 ] Yerevan was named the 2012 World Book Capital by UNESCO. [ http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID%3D35242%26amp%3BCr%3DUNESCO%26amp%3BCr1%3D Yerevan named World Book Capital 2012 by UN cultural agency ] [ Etymology and symbols ] { Erebuni Fortress, built by King } { Argishti I in 782 BC } One theory regarding the origin of Yerevan&apos;s name is the city was named after the Armenian king, Yervand IV (the Last), the last leader of the Orontid Dynasty, and founder of the city of Yervandashat. However, it is likely that the city&apos;s name is derived from the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni (Էրեբունի), which was founded on the territory of modern-day Yerevan in 782 BC by Argishti I. As elements of the Urartian language blended with that of the Armenian one, the name eventually evolved into Yerevan (Erebuni = Erevani = Erevan = Yerevan). Scholar Margarit Israelyan notes these changes when comparing inscriptions found on two cuneiform tablets at Erebuni: { Israelyan, Margarit A. Էրեբունի: Բերդ-Քաղաքի Պատմություն (Erebuni: The History of a Fortress-City). Yerevan, Armenian SSR: Hayastan Publishing Press, 1971, p. 137. } { Mount Ararat – symbol of the Armenian nation and Yerevan – overlooking the city } Early Christian Armenian chroniclers attributed the origin of the name, &quot; Yerevan, &quot; to a derivation from an expression exclaimed by Noah, in Armenian. While looking in the direction of Yerevan, after the ark had landed on Mount Ararat and the flood waters had receded, Noah is believed to have exclaimed, &quot; Yerevats! &quot; ( &quot; it appeared! &quot; ). { Baghdasaryan A., Simonyan A, et al. «Երևան» (Yerevan). } { Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia. vol. iii. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: } { Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1977, pp. 548–564. } In Armenian manuscripts, Yerevan was also mentioned as Erevan, Erivan, Erewan, Ervan, Eruan, Arevan, Iravan, Revan and Ayravan. { [Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia, Vol.3 page 550, Yerevan 1977] } However, the predominant former names of the city are Erebuni and Erevan. The principal symbol of Yerevan is Mount Ararat, which is visible from any area in the capital. The seal of the city is a crowned lion on a pedestal with the inscription &quot; Yerevan. &quot; The lion&apos;s head is turned backwards while it holds a scepter using the right front leg, the attribute of power and royalty. The symbol of eternity is on the breast of the lion with a picture of Ararat in the upper part. The emblem is a rectangular shield with a blue border. [ http://www.yerevan.am/index.php?page%3Demblem%26amp%3Blang%3Deng Symbols and emblems of the city Yerevan.am 2 July 2010 ] On 27 September 2004, Yerevan adopted a hymn, &quot; Erebuni-Yerevan &quot;, written by Paruyr Sevak and composed by Edgar Hovhanissian. It was selected in a competition for a new hymn and new flag that would best represent the city. The chosen flag has a white background with the city&apos;s seal in the middle, surrounded by twelve small red triangles that symbolize the twelve historic capitals of Armenia. The flag includes the three colours of the Armenian National flag. The lion is portrayed on the orange background with blue edging.

King Arame was the founder of the state which was one of the most developed states of its age. [ http://www.yerevan.am/main.php?page_id%3D278%26amp%3Blang%3D3 Yerevan Municipality:Old Yerevan ] However, the territory of Yerevan-Erebuni was settled in the fourth millennium B.C., fortified settlements from the Bronze Age include Shengavit, Tsitsernakaberd, Teishebaini, Arin Berd, Karmir Berd and Berdadzor. Archaeological evidence, such as a cuneiform inscription, { Brady Kiesling, } [ http://yerevan.usembassy.gov/armenia.pdf Rediscovering Armenia 2000 27 April 2008 http://web.archive.org/web/20070926164336/http%3A//yerevan.usembassy.gov/armenia.pdf 26 September 2007 ] indicates that the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni (Էրեբունի) was founded in 782 BC (29 years earlier than Rome) by the orders of King Argishti I at the site of current-day Yerevan, to serve as a fort and citadel guarding against attacks from the north Caucasus. Yerevan, as mentioned, is one of the most ancient cities in the world. The cuneiform inscription found at Erebuni Fortress reads: [ By the greatness of the God Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, built this mighty stronghold and proclaimed it Erebuni for the glory of Biainili [Urartu] and to instill fear among the king&apos;s enemies. Argishti says, &quot; The land was a desert, before the great works I accomplished upon it. By the greatness of Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, is a mighty king, king of Biainili, and ruler of Tushpa. &quot; [ Van ]. Israelyan. Erebuni, p. 9. ] Between the sixth and fourth centuries BC, Yerevan was one of the main centers of the Armenian satrap y of the Achaemenid Empire. During the height of Urartian power, irrigation canals and an artificial reservoir were built on Yerevan&apos;s territory. In 585 BC, the fortress of Teishebaini (Karmir Blur), thirty miles to the north of Yerevan, was destroyed by an alliance of Medes and the Scythians. Due to the absence of historical data, the timespan between the fourth century BC and the third century AD is known as the &quot; Yerevan Dark Ages. &quot; Armenia became a Christian nation in 301. The first church in Yerevan; the church of St. Peter and Paul, was built in the fifth century, and was demolished in 1931 to build a cinema hall. The Tsiranavor Church (595–602) of Avan district which was partly damaged in the 1679 earthquake, is the city&apos;s oldest surviving church. [ Arab, Persian and Ottoman rule ] { Jean Chardin in 1673 } In 658 AD, Yerevan was conquered, during the height of Arab invasions. Since then, and as a result of the Arab trade activities, the site has been strategically important as a crossroads for the Arab caravan routes passing between Europe and India through lands controlled by the Arabs. It has been known as &quot; Yerevan &quot; since at least the seventh century AD. Between the ninth and eleventh centuries, Yerevan was a secure part of the Armenian Bagratuni Kingdom, before being overrun by Seljuks. The city was seized and pillaged by Tamerlane in 1387 and subsequently became an administrative center of the Ilkhanate. Due to its strategic significance, Yerevan was constantly fought over, and passed back and forth, between the dominion of Persia and the Ottomans. At the height of the Turkish-Persian wars, Yerevan changed hands fourteen times between 1513 and 1737. In 1604, under the order of Shah Abbas I, tens of thousands of Armenians including citizens from Yerevan were deported to Persia. As a consequence, population became 80 percent Muslim (Persians, Turco, Kurds) and 20 percent Armenian. Muslims were either sedentary, semi-sedentary, or nomadic. Armenians lived in Erevan or the villages. The Armenians dominated the various professions and trade in the area and were of great economic significance to the Persian administration. { Encyclopaedia Iranica (George A. Bournoutian and Robert H. Hewsen, Erevan) } The Ottomans, Safavids, and Ilkhanids, all maintained a mint in Yerevan. During the 1670s, the Frenchman Jean Chardin visited Yerevan and gave a description of the city in his Travels of Cavalier Chardin in Transcaucasia in 1672–1673. On 7 June 1679, a devastating earthquake razed the city to the ground.During the Safavid Dynasty rule, Yerevan and adjacent territories were part of the Čoḵūr Saʿd administrative territory. This lasted until 1828, when the region was incorporated into Russian Empire. [ Russian rule ] { Erivan Governorate } During the second Russian-Persian war, Yerevan was captured [ Ferro Mark The Use and Abuse of History: How the Past Is Taught to Children Routledge 2003 London 233 0-415-28592-5 ] [ Kirakossian Arman J.

It was formally ceded by the Persians in 1828, following the Treaty of Turkmenchay. Tsarist Russia sponsored Armenian resettlement from Persia and Turkey. Due to the resettlement, Armenians&apos; share in city population increased from 28% to 53.8%. The resettlement was intended to create Russian power bridgehead in the Middle East. { The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict: A Legal Analysis. Heiko Krger, Heiko Krüger. Springer, 2010. ISBN 3-642-11787-2, ISBN 978-3-642-11787-9. } In 1829, Armenian repatriates from Persia were resettled in the city and a new quarter was built. Yerevan has served as the seat of the newly-formed Armenian Oblast between 1828–1840. By the time of Nicholas I &apos;s visit in 1837, Yerevan had become an uyezd. In 1840, the Armenian Oblast was dissolved and its territory incorporated into a larger new province; the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate. In 1850 the territory of the former oblast was tuned into reorganized into the Erivan Governorate. Yerevan was the centre of the newly established governorate until 1917, when Erivan governorate was dissolved. Yerevan began to grow economically and politically, with old buildings torn down and new buildings in European style erected instead. The first general plan of the city was made in 1854, during which, St. Hripsime and St. Gayane women&apos;s colleges were opened and the English Park was founded. In 1874, Zacharia Gevorkian opened Yerevan&apos;s first printing house and in 1879 the first theatre, sited near the church of St. Peter and Paul, was established. At the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan city&apos;s population was over 29,000, of which 49% were Caucasian Tatars, 48% Armenians and 2% Russians. { &apos;&apos;Erivan&apos;&apos; in the } { Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890–1907. } In 1902, a railway line linked Yerevan with Alexandropol, Tiflis and Ju2, a railway line linked Yerevan with Alexandropol, Tiflis and Julfa. In the same year, Yerevan&apos;s first public library was opened. In 1905, the grandnephew of Napoleon I; prince Louis Joseph Jérôme Napoléon (1864–1932) was appointed as governor of Erivan province.

[ Brief independence (1917–1920) ] { Democratic Republic of Armenia (1918–1920) } At the start of the 20th century, Yerevan was a small town with a population of 30,000. { Encyclopædia Universalis France S.A., « Erevan », 1995. } In 1917, the Russian Empire ended with the October Revolution. In the aftermath, Armenian, Georgian and Muslim leaders of Transcaucasia united to form the Transcaucasian Federation and proclaimed Transcaucasia&apos;s secession. The Federation, however, was short-lived and on 28 May 1918, the Dashnak leader Aram Manukian declared the independence of Armenia. Subsequently, Yerevan became the capital and the centre of the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Armenia, although the members of the Armenian National Council were yet to stay in Tiflis until their arrival in Yerevan to form the government in the summer of the same year. On 26 May 1919, the government passed a law to open the Yerevan State University, which was situated on the main street of Yerevan, the Astafyan (now Abovyan) street. However, after a short period of independence, on 29 November 1920, the Bolshevik 11th Red Army entered Yerevan during the Russian Civil War, on 29 November 1920, and Armenia was incorporated into the Soviet Union on 2 December 1920. Although nationalist forces managed to retake the city in February 1921, and successfully released all the political leaders, the city&apos;s nationalist elite were once again defeated by Soviet forces on 2 April 1921. [ Soviet Yerevan ] { The Republic Square } { Alexander Tamanian &apos;s architecture of Soviet era on Tamanyan street } Yerevan became the capital of the newly formed Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the fifteen republics of the Soviet Union. Yerevan was the first city in the Soviet Union, for which a general plan was developed. The &quot; General Plan of Yerevan &quot; was developed by the academician Alexander Tamanyan which was approved in 1924. The plan was designed for a population of 150,000. During the Soviet era the city was transformed into a modern industrial metropolis of over a million people, to become a significant scientific and cultural centre. Tamanian incorporated national traditions with contemporary urban construction. His design presented a radial-circular arrangement that overlaid the existing city and incorporated much of its existing street plan. As a result, many historic buildings were demolished, including churches, mosques, the Persian fortress, baths, bazaars and caravanserai s. Many of the districts around central Yerevan were named after former Armenian communities that were destroyed by the Ottoman Turks during the Armenian Genocide. The districts of Arabkir, Malatya-Sebastia and Nork Marash, for example, were named after the towns Arabkir, Malatya, Sebastia, and Marash, respectively. After the end of World War II, German POW s were used to help in the construction of new buildings and structures, such as the Kievyan Bridge. In 1965, during the commemorations of the fiftieth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Yerevan was the location of a demonstration, the first such demonstration in the Soviet Union, to demand recognition of the Genocide by the Soviet authorities.

The reforms of Glasnost and Perestroika opened questions on issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the environment, Russification, corruption, democracy, and eventually independence. At the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Yerevantsis engaged in demonstrations concerning these subjects, centered on Theater Square. [ Malkasian Mark Gha-ra-bagh!: The Emergence of the National Democratic Movement in Armenia Wayne State University Press 1996 41 0-8143-2605-6 ] [ Post-USSR independence ] { Northern Avenue } Following the dismantling of the USSR or Soviet Union, Yerevan became the capital of the Republic of Armenia on 21 September 1991. Maintaining supplies of gas and electricity proved difficult; constant electricity was not restored until 1996 amidst the chaos of the badly instingated and planned transition to a market based economy. Since 2000, central Yerevan has been transformed into a vast construction site, with cranes erected all over the Kentron district. Officially, the scores of multi-storied buildings are part of large-scale urban planning projects. Roughly $1.8  billion was spent on such construction in 2006, according to the national statistical service. Prices for downtown apartments have increased by about ten times over the last decade. Political demonstrations are a common scene in Yerevan. In 2008, unrest in the capital between the authorities and opposition demonstrators led by ex-President Levon Ter-Petrosyan occurred after the 2008 Armenian presidential election. The events resulted in ten deaths { Death Toll in Armenia’s Post-election Melee Rises to Ten &quot;, Armenia Liberty ([RFE/RL]), 14 April 2008 } and a subsequent 20-day state of emergency declared by President Robert Kocharian. { Armenia declares emergency rule &quot;, } { BBC News, 1 March 2008. } [ Geography ] [ Topography and location ] Yerevan situated in the Ararat Valley [ 990 m 2 on ] [ 865 m 2 on ] [ 1390 m 2 on ] Altitude: average – minimum – maximum.

Yerevan is located in the center-west of the country in the north-eastern extremity of the Ararat Valley. Historically, the city is situated at the heart of the Armenian Highland, in Kotayk canton ( [ Կոտայք գաւառ ] Kotayk gavar, not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province ) of Ayrarat province, within Armenia Major. The upper part of the city is surrounded with mountains on three sides while it descends to the banks of the river Hrazdan at the south. Hrazdan divides Yerevan into two parts through a picturesque canyon. The city&apos;s elevation ranges between [ 900 to 1300 m 2 on ] above sea level. As the capital of Armenia, Yerevan is not part of any marz ( &quot; province &quot; ). Instead, it is bordered with the following provinces: Kotayk from the north and the east, Ararat from the south and the south-west, Armavir from the west and Aragatsotn from the north-west. [ Climate ] The climate of Yerevan is a semi-arid, continental climate ( Köppen climate classification BSk ), with hot and dry summers and cold and snowy winters. This is attributed to the fact that Yerevan is located on a plain surrounded by mountains and to its distance to the sea and its effects. The summers are usually very hot with the temperature in August reaching up to [ 40 °C 0 on ], while winters generally carry snowfall and freezing temperatures with January often being as cold as [ -15 °C 0 on ]. The amount of precipitation is small, amounting annually to about [ 318 mm in ]. Yerevan experiences an average of 2,700 sunlight hours per year.

Situated in the Ararat plain, the historic lands of Armenia, it served as the best logical choice for capital of the young republic at the time. When Armenia became a republic of the Soviet Union, Yerevan remained as capital and accommodated all the political and diplomatic institutions in the republic. In 1991 with the independence of Armenia, Yerevan continued with its status as the political and cultural centre of the country, being home to all the national institutions: the Government house, the Parliament, ministries, the presidential palace, the constitutional court, judicial bodies and other public organisations.

However with the breakout of the Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988 to 1994, the Azerbaijani minority diminished in the country in what was part of population exchanges between Armenia and Azerbaijan. A big part of the Russian minority also fled the country during the 1990s economic crisis in the country. Today, the population of Yerevan is mainly Armenian. Like the rest of the country and all other ex-Soviet republics, a lot of people fled their countries (mostly to Europe and North America) due to economic crises.
