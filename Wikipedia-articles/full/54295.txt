[ http://www.sanrioeurope.com/about.asp Sanrio Europe 2009-09-14 ] Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974.

Sanrio decided to make Hello Kitty British because at the time when she was created, foreign countries, in particular Britain, were trendy in Japan. In addition, Sanrio already had a number of characters set in the US and they wanted Hello Kitty to be different. Shimizu got the name Kitty from Lewis Carroll &apos;s Through the Looking-Glass, where in a scene early in the book Alice plays with a cat she calls Kitty.

He first considered &quot; Hi Kitty &quot; before settling on &quot; Hello &quot; for the greeting.

ISBN 1-4000-6391-4, ISBN 978-1-4000-6391-8. } Another explanation Sanrio has given for her lack of a mouth is that she &quot; speaks from the heart. She&apos;s Sanrio&apos;s ambassador to the world and isn&apos;t bound to any particular language &quot;. Representatives for Sanrio have said they see Hello Kitty as a symbol of friendship, and they hope she will encourage friendship between people across the world. There has been some suggestion that Hello Kitty has its origins in Maneki Neko, and that the name Hello Kitty itself is a back-translation of Maneki Neko, which means beckoning cat in English. [ History ] Hello Kitty sold well immediately after the 1974 launch, and Sanrio&apos;s sales increased seven times up until 1978 when they slumped temporarily.
