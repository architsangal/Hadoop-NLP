The Saints are a member of the North Division of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Saints have played their home games at Midway Stadium since 1993, when the modern-day team started as a member of the Northern League. In 2006 the team was a founding member of the modern American Association. Before the arrival of the Minnesota Twins in 1961, there was a long history of minor-league baseball teams called the St. Paul Saints, as well as their crosstown rivals the Minneapolis Millers. One incarnation of the Saints participated in the Union Association, a short-lived major league, in 1884. A second incarnation was active in the Western League from 1894 to 1899, and became a forerunner of the modern Chicago White Sox. The third and most long-lived incarnation of the Saints was active in the American Association from 1915 to 1960. [ History ] The current inception of the St. Paul Saints was formed in 1993 in the Northern League, one of several independent leagues not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Saints are known for promotions that are sometimes over-the-top even by the standards of minor league baseball. In this regard, Mike Veeck, formerly the team&apos;s principal owner and still owner of a large interest in the team, is seen as following in the footsteps of his father Bill Veeck, who was famous for conceiving outlandish promotions as an owner of the Major League teams the St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox. The current majority owner, Marvin Goldklang, also owns a stake in four other minor league baseball teams: the Fort Myers Miracle, Sioux Falls Pheasants, Hudson Valley Renegades, and Charleston RiverDogs. Comedian and actor Bill Murray is also a part owner. Despite the considerable naysaying at their inception, the Saints became one of the most successful teams in the Northern League and all of independent baseball. In 2002-2004, the Saints saw severely reduced attendance, owing partially to renewed interest in the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball, who won the 2002, 2003, and 2004 American League Central Division championships. In spite of an initially cool, if not outright hostile reception, the Saints and their Major League neighbor (less than 10 miles away) have worked together for several years to promote the sport of baseball. The Saints have figured prominently in the creation of modern independent baseball. The team has been featured in books ( &quot; Rebel Baseball &quot; by Steve Perlstein, 1993; &quot; Slouching Toward Fargo &quot; by Neal Karlen, 1998) and a cable network series ( &quot; Baseball, Minnesota &quot;, FX Network, 1996–97). Mike Veeck wrote a book that covered the mantra &quot; Fun is Good &quot; (2005) and describes the business approach he has used for many years. In a tradition started in the team&apos;s first year, the Saints pig brings out game balls and receives a snack between innings. On September 29, 2005, the Saints left the Northern League, along with the Lincoln Saltdogs, Sioux City Explorers, and the Sioux Falls Pheasants to start the American Association for the 2006 season. In June 2009 the Saints began a push to build a new stadium in Downtown Saint Paul. The proposed 7,500 seat stadium would be located in the Lowertown neighborhood near a planned maintenance facility for the Central Corridor light rail line. While baseball stadiums are usually designed to face east so batters don&apos;t have to stare into the evening sun, the new stadium is currently designed to face southwest, relying on downtown skyscrapers to shield the batters&apos; eyes. The city of Saint Paul requested $25 million dollars in its 2010 bonding wish list to the Minnesota Legislature. { Havens, Chris (June 26, 2009) &quot; Wish list: New home for Saints &quot; } { Star Tribune.

The WL had reorganized itself in November, 1893, with Ban Johnson as President. Johnson, a Cincinnati-based reporter, had been recommended by his friend Charles Comiskey, former major league star with the St. Louis Browns in the 1880s, who was then managing the Cincinnati Reds. After the 1894 season, when Comiskey&apos;s contract with the Reds was up, he decided to take his chances at ownership. He bought the Sioux City team and transferred it to St. Paul, where it enjoyed some success over the next 5 seasons. In 1900, the Western League changed its name to the American League. It was still officially a minor league, a part of the National Agreement and an underling of the National League. The NL actually gave permission to the AL to put a team in Chicago, and on March 21, 1900, Comiskey moved his St. Paul club to the South Side, where they became the Chicago White Sox. { Joe Riggert accumulated 1,639 hits over 12 seasons with the old Saints. } [ St. Paul Saints (1915-1960) ] Another team called the Saints played minor league baseball in the American Association from 1915 to 1960. The Saints finished first in the American Association nine times, and won the Little World Series in 1924. During this period, the Saints were a farm club of the Chicago White Sox (1936–1942), the Brooklyn Dodgers (1944–1957), and the Los Angeles Dodgers (1958–1960). The Saints played streetcar home and away double headers with their local rivals, the Minneapolis Millers. When the Minnesota Twins came to town in 1961, the Saints became the Omaha Dodgers and the Millers went out of existence. Lexington Park served as the Saints&apos; home stadium for most of those years. [ Current roster ] Saints pitcher Mitch Wylie during a game on June 23, 2009.

Fans were asked during the game to spin the heads of their dolls to either Coleman or Franken. Attorneys were present to count the &quot; votes &quot; from this process, a jab at the extensive involvement of attorneys in the recount process. The team&apos;s official web site stated that fans could challenge the &quot; results &quot; at the team&apos;s Fan Services booth during the game. The team also facetiously stated on its site that it would not make the results of that night&apos;s game official until mid-June—around the time that the entire Minnesota Supreme Court was scheduled to rule on Coleman&apos;s appeal of a panel ruling that Franken had won. (The Court issued its ruling in Franken&apos;s favor on June 30, with Coleman then conceding.) { In May, 2008, the Saints announced the giveaway of 2,500 bobble foot dolls, ostensibly to celebrate National Tap Dance Day.
