(However, Wallis and Futuna is not part of, nor even contiguous with, French Polynesia. Wallis and Futuna is located at the very opposite western end of Polynesia.) Its land area is 264  km 2 with a population of about 15,000. Mata-Utu is the capital and biggest city. The territory is made up of three main volcanic tropical island s along with a number of tiny islets, and is split into two island groups that lie about 260  km apart, namely Wallis Island s (Uvea) in the northeast, and Hoorn Islands (also called the Futuna Islands) in the southwest, including Futuna Island proper and the mostly uninhabited Alofi Island. Since 2003 Wallis and Futuna has been a French overseas collectivity ( collectivité d&apos;outre-mer, or COM). Between 1961 and 2003, it had the status of a French overseas territory ( territoire d&apos;outre-mer, or TOM). [ Politics ] [ Politics of Wallis and Futuna ] The territory is divided into three traditional kingdoms (royaumes coutumiers): Uvea, on the island of Wallis, Sigave, on the western part of the island of Futuna, and Alo, on the island of Alofi and on the eastern part of the island of Futuna (only Uvea is further subdivided, into three districts): Kingdom    District Capital Area (km²) Population July 2008 Census Villages Wallis Island s `Uvea (Wallis) Matā utu 77.5 9,227 23 Hihifo ( &quot; west &quot; ) Vaitupu 23.4 2,203 5 Hahake ( &quot; east &quot; ) Matā utu 27.8 3,759 6 Mu&apos;a ( &quot; first &quot; ) Mala&apos;efo&apos;ou (1) 26.3 3,265 12 Hoorn Islands Sigave (Singave) Leava 30.0 1,591 6 Alo Mala&apos;e 85.0 2,666 9 overall total Matā utu 192.5 13,484 38 (1)  formerly called Mua The capital of the territory is Matā utu on the island of Wallis, the most populous island. As a territory of France, it is governed under the French constitution of 28 September 1958, and has universal suffrage for those over 18 years of age. The French president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term; the high administrator is appointed by the French president on the advice of the French Ministry of the Interior; the presidents of the Territorial Government and the Territorial Assembly are elected by the members of the assembly. The head of state is President François Hollande of France as represented by High Administrator Philippe Paolantoni (since September 2008). The President of the Territorial Assembly is Victor Brial since 11 December 2007. { World Statesmen source } The Council of the Territory consists of three kings (monarchs of the three pre-colonial kingdoms) and three members appointed by the high administrator on the advice of the Territorial Assembly. The legislative branch consists of the unicameral Territorial Assembly or Assemblée territoriale of 20 seats; the members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms. Wallis and Futuna elects one senator to the French Senate and one deputy to the French National Assembly. Justice is generally administered under French law by a tribunal of first instance in Mata-Utu, but the three traditional kingdoms administer justice according to customary law (only for non-criminal cases). The court of appeal is in Nouméa, New Caledonia. The territory participates in the Franc Zone, and as a permanent member of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and as an observer of the Pacific Islands Forum. [ History ] { Talietumu fort } Although the Dutch and the British were the European discoverers of the islands in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was the French who were the first Europeans to settle in the territory, with the arrival of French missionaries in 1837, who converted the population to Roman Catholicism. Pierre Chanel, canonized as a saint in 1954, is a major patron of the island of Futuna and the region. Wallis is named after the British explorer, Samuel Wallis. [ June 2011 ] On 5 April 1842, the missionaries asked for the protection of France after the rebellion of a part of the local population. On 5 April 1887, the queen of Uvea (on the island of Wallis) signed a treaty officially establishing a French protectorate. The kings of Sigave and Alo on the islands of Futuna and Alofi also signed a treaty establishing a French protectorate on 16 February 1888. The islands were put under the authority of the French colony of New Caledonia. In 1917, the three traditional kingdoms were annexed to France and turned into the Colony of Wallis and Futuna, still under the authority of the Colony of New Caledonia. [ December 2008 ] In 1959, the inhabitants of the islands voted to become a French overseas territory, effective in 1961, thus ending their subordination to New Caledonia. { http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107555.html } In 2005, the 50th king, Tomasi Kulimoetoke II, faced being deposed after giving sanctuary to his grandson who was convicted of manslaughter. The king claimed his grandson should be judged by tribal law rather than by the French penal system. There were riots in the streets involving the king&apos;s supporters, who were victorious over attempts to replace the king. Two years later, Tomasi Kulimoetoke died on 7 May 2007. The state was in a six-month period of mourning. During this period, mentioning a successor was forbidden. [ BBC News BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6711691.stm Been and gone – fit for a King 3 June 2007 1 June 2007 ] On 25 July 2008, Kapiliele Faupala was installed as king despite protests from some of the royal clans. [ Geography ] Map of the territory of Wallis and Futuna Lake Lalolalo on ʻUvea Wallis and Futuna is located about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand, at [ 13 18 S 176 12 W type:isle inline,title ], (225  mi west of Samoa and [ 300 mi km on ] north-east of Fiji). The territory includes the island of Wallis (the most populous), the island of Futuna, the essentially uninhabited island of Alofi (the population of Alofi was reportedly eaten by the cannibal people of Futuna in one single raid in the 19th century), and 20 uninhabited islets, totaling [ 274 km2 sqmi ] with [ 129 km mi ] of coastline. The highest point in the territory is Mont Puke (on the island of Futuna) at [ 524 m ft ]. The islands have a hot, rainy season from November to April and a cool, dry season from May to October. The rains accumulate 2,500 to 3,000 millimetres (98–118  in) each year. The average humidity is 80% and the temperature [ 26.6 C F ]. Only five percent of the islands&apos; land area is arable land; permanent crops cover another 20%. Deforestation (only small portions of the original forests remain), largely as a result of the continued use of wood as the main fuel source, is a serious problem; as a consequence of cutting down the forests, the mountainous terrain of Futuna is particularly prone to erosion. There are no permanent settlements on Alofi because of the lack of natural fresh water resources. The two island groups lie about 260  km apart: Wallis Island (Uvea) { Hoorn Islands (Futuna Islands), in the southwest } Futuna Alofi [ Economy ] The GDP of Wallis and Futuna in 2005 was 188 million US dollars at market exchange rates. The GDP per capita was 12,640 US dollars in 2005 (at market exchange rates, not at PPP ), which is lower than in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and all the other French overseas departments and territories (except Mayotte ), but higher than in all the small insular independent states of Oceania. The territory&apos;s economy is limited to traditional subsistence agriculture, with about 80% of the labor force earning its livelihood from agriculture ( coconut s and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing. About 4% of the population is employed in government. Revenues come from French government subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia, French Polynesia and France. Industries include copra, handicrafts, fishing, and lumber. Agricultural products include breadfruit, yam s, taro, bananas, pigs, and goats. In 2007, US$63  million worth of commodities (foodstuffs, manufactured goods, transportation equipment, fuel, clothing) were imported, primarily from France, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, and there were no exports (the previous year, in 2006, exports amounted to US$122,000 and consisted entirely of 19 ton s of trochus shells).

Banking: In 1991, BNP Nouvelle-Calédonie, a subsidiary of BNP Paribas, established a subsidiary, Banque de Wallis et Futuna, which currently is the only bank in the territory. Two years earlier Banque Indosuez had closed the branch at Mata-Utu that it had opened in 1977, leaving the territory without any bank. [ Demographics ] [ Demographics of Wallis and Futuna ] The total population of the territory at the July 2008 census was 13,484 (68.4% on the island of Wallis, 31.6% on the island of Futuna), down from 14,944 at the July 2003 census.

More than 16,000 Wallisians and Futunians live as expatriates in New Caledonia, which is more than the total population of Wallis and Futuna. The overwhelming majority of the people in Wallis and Futuna are Catholic. [ Languages ] [ Wallisian language Futunan language ] At the 2008 census, among the population whose age was 14 and older, 60.2% of people reported that the language they speak the most at home is Wallisian, 29.9% reported that the language they speak the most at home is Futunan, and 9.7% reported that the language they speak the most at home is French.

[ Culture ] Dancers from Wallis and Futuna performing the &apos;Plantation&apos; The culture of Wallis and Futuna is Polynesian, and is very similar to the cultures of its neighbouring nations Samoa and Tonga. The Wallisian and Futunan culture share very similar components to culture; language, dance, cuisine and modes of celebration. The language native to and spoken daily by the islanders is the &apos;Uvea language, which traces its roots to Samoic origin. Despite this, the official language (because of its administrative purposes) is French. [ Wallis and Futuna: Culture ] In Wallis and Futuna, culture is prided by the locals. Traditional events like the kava ceremony, going to church (largely Roman Catholic ), plantation &amp; agriculture, and fishing are all highly regarded. [ February 2012 ] [ Transport and communications ] In 1994, the territory had 1,125 telephones in use, had one AM radio station, and two television broadcast stations. Due to this, communication costs are high, costing up to ten times as much as western countries. The island of Wallis has about [ 100 km mi ] of highway, of which 16 paved, while the island of Futuna has only [ 20 km mi ], none paved. The territory has two main ports and harbours, Mata-Utu and Leava (on the island of Futuna), that support its merchant marine fleet consisting of three ships (two passenger ships and a petroleum tanker), totaling 92,060 GRT or 45,881 tonnes. There are two airports, one on Wallis with a paved runway of [ 2100 m ft ], and one on Futuna with a [ 1 km mi ] unpaved strip. New Caledonia-based Aircalin operates the only commercial flights that go to Wallis, where it has an office in Mata-Utu. There are no commercial boat operators.
