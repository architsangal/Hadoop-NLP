[ History ] Umeda Station on the day of inauguration [ Foundation ] In 1907, [ Minoo Arima Electric Tramway Company 箕面有馬電気軌道株式会社 Minoo Arima Denki Kidō Kabushiki Gaisha ], a forerunner of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc., was established by Ichizō Kobayashi.On 10 March 1910, Minoo Arima Tramway opened the rail lines from Umeda to Takarazuka (the Takarazuka Main Line ) and from Ishibashi to Minoo (the Minoo Line ). [ Expansion to Kobe ] On February 4, 1918, Minoo Arima Tramway was renamed [ Hanshin Kyūkō Railway Company 阪神急行電鉄株式会社 Hanshin Kyūkō Dentetsu Kabushiki Gaisha referred to as &quot; Hankyū &quot;, 阪急 ].On July 16, 1920, the Kobe Main Line from Jūsō to Kobe (later, renamed Kamitsutsui) and the Itami Line from Tsukaguchi to Itami were opened.On April 1, 1936, the Kobe Main Line was extended from Nishi-Nada (present: Ōji-kōen) to the new terminal in Kobe (present: Sannomiya Station ), and the Kobe Main Line from Nishi-Nada to Kamitsutsui was named the Kamitsutsui Line, which was abandoned on May 20, 1940. In 1936, Hankyu established a professional baseball team and in 1937 the Nishinomiya Stadium as the team&apos;s home field was completed near Nishinomiya-Kitaguchi Station. The Hankyu Braves (named in 1947) played until the 1988 season and became the predecessors of the present-day Orix Buffaloes. [ Merger and separation with Keihan ] On October 1, 1943, under the order of the government, Hanshin Kyūkō and Keihan Electric Railway were merged, and renamed [ Keihanshin Kyūkō Railway Company 京阪神急行電鉄株式会社 Keihanshin Kyūkō Dentetsu Kabushiki Gaisha referred to as &quot; Keihanshin &quot;, 京阪神 ]. The merged lines included the Keihan Main Line, the Uji Line, the Shinkeihan Line (present-day Kyoto Main Line), the Senriyama Line (present-day Senri Line), the Jūsō Line (part of Kyoto Main Line), the Arashiyama Line, the Keishin Line and the Ishiyama Sakamoto Line. The Katano Line was also added in 1945. On December 1, 1949, the Keihan Main Line, the Katano Line, the Uji Line, the Keishin Line, and the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line were split off to become part of the newly-established Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. Although this revived the former Keihan Electric Railway, Keihan was now smaller than before the 1943 merger, because the Shinkeihan Line and its branches were not given up by Keihanshin. The present structure of the Hankyu network with the three main lines was fixed by this transaction. The abbreviation of Keihanshin Kyūkō Railway was changed from &quot; Keihanshin &quot; to &quot; Hankyū &quot;.

On April 1, 2005, former Hankyu Corporation became a holding company and was renamed [ Hankyu Holdings, Inc. 阪急ホールディングス株式会社 Hankyū Hōrudhingusu Kabushiki Gaisha ]. The railway business was ceded to a subsidiary, now named Hankyu Corporation (before the restructuring, the new company which reused a dormant company founded on December 7, 1989 was called &quot; Act Systems &quot; (株式会社アクトシステムズ) until March 28, 2004, then &quot; Hankyū Dentetsu Bunkatsu Junbi K.K. &quot; (阪急電鉄分割準備株式会社) from the next day). On October 1, 2006, Hankyu Holdings became the wholly owning parent company of Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd. and the holdings were renamed Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc..
