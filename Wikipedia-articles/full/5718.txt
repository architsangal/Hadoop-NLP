He argues that &quot; music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality &quot;, but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that&apos;s when &quot; things could lead a young mind in a direction. &quot; { Chuck D: The D is for Dangerous } He also founded the record company Slam Jamz and acted as narrator in Kareem Adouard&apos;s short film Bling: Consequences and Repercussions, which examines the role of conflict diamonds in bling fashion. In an interview with Le Monde published January 29, 2008, { LeMonde.fr : Chuck D Le rap sans strass } Chuck D stated that rap is devolving so much into a commercial enterprise, that the relationship between the rapper and the record label is that of slave to a master. He believes that nothing has changed for African-Americans since the debut of Public Enemy and, although he thinks that an Obama-Clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. He also stated that French President Sarkozy is like any other European elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from Africa. In this article, he also defended a comment made by Professor Griff in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media. The real statement was a critique of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinian people. Chuck D stated that it is Public Enemy&apos;s belief that all human beings are equal. In an interview with the magazine N&apos;Digo published in late June 2008, he spoke of today&apos;s mainstream urban music seemingly relishing the addictive euphoria of materialism and sexism, perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. However he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying &quot; It’s only going to be dead if it doesn’t talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement &quot;, citing artists such as NYOil, M.I.A. and the The Roots as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. &quot; A lot of cats are out there doing it, on the Web and all over. They’re just not placing their career in the hands of some major corporation. &quot; { Muhammad, Cinque. &quot; Hip-Hop Conspiracy?
