[ History ] Toronto was named after Toronto, Ontario, Canada in honour of Edward Hanlan, a world-champion sculler who visited Australia in 1884. [ http://www.lakemac.infohunt.nsw.gov.au/library/lhist/suburb/lmp%26amp%3Bp/toronto.htm# History of Toronto 2011-12-21 ] The area&apos;s subdividers, the Excelsior Company, named the land in honour of Hanlan&apos;s visit, which coincided with the opening of the subdivision. The name was not publicly used until 1887. The Canadian city&apos;s name comes from the Mohawk language tkaronto, meaning where there are trees standing in the water. [ http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/toronto_e.php The real story of how Toronto got its name Natural Resources Canada 2006-04-17 ] Toronto was originally the site of an Aboriginal mission called Ebenezer, established in 1829 by Reverend Threlkeld. Threlkeld is reported to have begun construction of his chimney with a local black stone which he later realised was coal. Coal Point is named after this discovery. The development of several coal mines in the region, proximity to the nearby city of Newcastle, and its position by the lake led to gradual development and population increases. Following the closure of the Ebenezer Aboriginal Mission in 1890, the population of the Toronto area remained mostly Aboriginal. As the coal companies moved into the area, the aboriginal population were helped financially and the community was sustained mainly by the coal industry. However, it was not long before a mixture of land disputes and poor treatment of the local Aboriginals led to a major rally by the locals. This rally, which began as vandalism of mining company property, soon escalated into heavy violence and led to the Toronto massacre of 1896. Five Aboriginals were killed and many people on both sides were brutally beaten. { Bradford, E. 1998. A History of the Salt Water Lake: Lake Maquarie, Australia.
