Formed in 1993, [ http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Old_97%27s/Biography/ Old 97&apos;s Biography starpulse.com 2008-05-21 ] they have since released nine studio albums, two full extended play s, shared split duty on another, and have one live album. Their most recent release is The Grand Theatre, Volume Two. They are recognized as pioneers of the alt-country movement during the mid to late 1990s along with bands such as Uncle Tupelo, Drive-By Truckers, Whiskeytown, The Jayhawks, and The Bottle Rockets. [ Career ] Initially a popular Dallas bar band, the Old 97&apos;s toured the country after releasing their first album, 1994&apos;s Hitchhike to Rhome and 1995&apos;s split EP release Stoned / Garage Sale with fellow Dallas band Funland on Idol Records. In Chicago, they caught the attention of Bloodshot Records and were signed to record their next album. 1995&apos;s Wreck Your Life brought them to the attention of Elektra Records, who hoped that alt-country could be a new post- grunge fad. Lead singer Rhett Miller, born in Austin, later lived in New York City and Los Angeles. Many of the band&apos;s songs include local Texas references, with New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago appearing as well. Most songs are written and sung by Miller, with bassist Murry Hammond picking up the vocals on one or two tracks per album. Hammond also handled a number of country covers, especially in the band&apos;s earlier years. Hammond also performs gospel at his local church. The band&apos;s 2004 album Drag It Up also includes a song written and sung by guitarist Ken Bethea, &quot; Coahuila. &quot; The band has never reached the level of success expected of them by the music press and was one of the acts purged from Elektra after the merger of Time Warner and America Online. In 2005, Blender magazine ranked the band&apos;s most successful single, 1999&apos;s &quot; Murder (Or A Heart Attack) &quot;, as the 176th greatest song &quot; since you were born. &quot; [ The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born: 151-200 Blender October 2005 http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID%3D1764 ] However, more recently, their music has been featured in a number of hit movies and TV series, including The Break-Up ( &quot; Salome &quot;, &quot; Melt Show &quot;, &quot; Timebomb &quot; ), Ed ( &quot; Question &quot;, &quot; King of All the World &quot; ), Scrubs ( &quot; Question &quot; ), and Veronica Mars ( &quot; Adelaide &quot;, &quot; Four-Leaf Clover &quot;, &quot; The New Kid &quot; ). [ http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1851153/ IMDB 2009-02-16 ] Rhett Miller has recorded four solo albums, with 2002&apos;s The Instigator receiving substantial airplay on alternative -oriented radio stations. He toured with Neil Finn in 2004. Miller&apos;s second major commercial album, The Believer, was released in February 2006.
