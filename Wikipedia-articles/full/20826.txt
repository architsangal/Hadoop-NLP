{ Louvre Museum } The Mithraic Mysteries were a mystery religion practised in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to 4th centuries AD. The name of the Persian god Mithra, adapted into Greek as Mithras, was linked to a new and distinctive imagery. Romans also called the religion Mysteries of Mithras or Mysteries of the Persians; modern historians refer to it as Mithraism, [ http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithraism Mithraism 2011-03-24 Beck Roger 20-07-2002 Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition The term “Mithraism” is of course a modern coinage. In antiquity the cult was known as “the mysteries of Mithras”; alternatively, as “the mysteries of the Persians.”…The Mithraists, who were manifestly not Persians in any ethnic sense, thought of themselves as cultic “Persians.” …the ancient Roman Mithraists themselves were convinced that their cult was founded by none other than Zoroaster, who “dedicated to Mithras, the creator and father of all, a cave in the mountains bordering Persia,” an idyllic setting “abounding in flowers and springs of water” (Porphyry, On the Cave of the Nymphs 6). ] or sometimes Roman Mithraism.

Worshippers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of initiation, with ritual meals. Initiates called themselves syndexioi, those &quot; united by the handshake &quot;. They met in underground temples (called a mithraeum ), which survive in large numbers. The cult appears to have had its epicentre in Rome. Numerous archeological finds, including meeting places, monuments, and artifacts, have contributed to modern knowledge about Mithraism throughout the Roman Empire. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/paganshadowchrist_article_01.shtml The Pagan Shadow of Christ? 06-04-2011 Beck Roger 17-02-2011 BBC-History We know a good deal about them because archaeology has disinterred many meeting places together with numerous artifacts and representations of the cult myth, mostly in the form of relief sculpture. ] The iconic scenes of Mithras show him being born from a rock, slaughtering a bull, and sharing a banquet with the god Sol (the Sun). About 420 sites have yielded materials related to the cult. Among the items found are about 1000 inscriptions, 700 examples of the bull-killing scene ( tauroctony ), and about 400 other monuments. [ Clauss Manfred The Roman Cult of Mithras: The God and his Mysteries xxi 0-415-92977-6 ] It has been estimated that there would have been at least 680-690 Mithraea in Rome. No written narratives or theology from the religion survive, with limited information to be derived from the inscriptions, and only brief or passing references in Greek and Latin literature. Interpretation of the physical evidence remains problematic and contested. [ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 3 However, in the absence of any ancient explanations of its meaning, Mithraic iconography has proven to be exceptionally difficult to decipher. ] The Romans themselves regarded the mysteries as having Persian or Zoroastrian sources. Since the early 1970s, however, the dominant scholarship has cast this origin in doubt, and regarded the mysteries of Mithras as a distinct product of the Roman Imperial religious world. In this context, Mithraism has sometimes been viewed as a rival of early Christianity. [ The name Mithras ] [ Mithras (name) ] The name Mithras (Latin, equivalent to Greek &quot; Μίθρας &quot;, { Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short. A Latin Dictionary } ) is a form of Mithra, the name of an Old Persian god. [ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 90 It is therefore highly likely that it was in the context of Mithridates&apos; alliance with the Cilician pirates that there arose the synchretistic link between Perseus and Mithra which led to the name Mithras (a Greek form of the name Mithra) being given to the god of the new cult. ] [ Britannica, Encyclopedia of World Religions. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. 2006 509 978-1-59339-491-2...Mithra is the next most important deity and may even have occupied a position of near equality with Ahura Mazde. He was associated with the Sun, and in time the name Mithra became a common word for “Sun.” Mithra functioned preeminently in the ethical sphere; he was the god of the covenant, who oversaw all solemn agreements that people made among themselves... In later times Mithra gave his name to Mithraism, a Mystery religion. ] (This point has been understood by Mithras scholars since the days of Franz Cumont. [ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 8 Cumont&apos;s... argument was straightforward and may be summarized succinctly: the name of the god of the cult, Mithras, is the Latin (and Greek) form of the name of an ancient Iran ian god, Mithra; in addition, the Romans believed that their cult was connected with Persia (as the Romans called Iran); therefore we may assume that Roman Mithraism is nothing other than the Iranian cult of Mithra transplanted into the Roman Empire. ] ) An early example of the Greek form of the name is in a 4th century BC work by Xenophon, the Cyropaedia, which is a biography of the Persian king Cyrus the Great. { Xenophon, Cyropaedia 7.5.53. Cited in Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon } The exact form of a Latin or classical Greek word varies due to the grammatical process of declension. There is archeological evidence that in Latin worshippers wrote the nominative form of the god&apos;s name as &quot; Mithras &quot;. However, in Porphyry &apos;s Greek text De Abstinentia («Περὶ ἀποχῆς ἐμψύχων»), there is a reference to the now-lost histories of the Mithraic mysteries by Euboulus and Pallas, the wording of which suggests that these authors treated the name &quot; Mithra &quot; as an indeclinable foreign word.

Nevertheless, as the name Mithras alone shows, this content was of some importance; and the Persian affiliation of the Mysteries is acknowledged in the earliest literary reference to them. ] [ Iconography ] { Heidelberg, framed by scenes from Mithras&apos; life. } Much about the cult of Mithras is only known from reliefs and sculptures. There have been many attempts to interpret this material. Mithras-worship in the Roman Empire was characterized by images of the god slaughtering a bull. Other images of Mithras are found in the Roman temples, for instance Mithras banqueting with Sol, and depictions of the birth of Mithras from a rock. But the image of bull-slaying (tauroctony) is always in the central niche. [ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 6 ] Textual sources for a reconstruction of the theology behind this iconography are very rare. { Clauss, M. The Roman cult of Mithras, p. xxi: &quot; we possess virtually no theological statements either by Mithraists themselves or by other writers. &quot; } (See section Interpretations of the bull-slaying scene below.) The practice of depicting the god slaying a bull seems to be specific to Roman Mithraism. According to David Ulansey, this is &quot; perhaps the most important example &quot; of evident difference between Iranian and Roman traditions: &quot;... there is no evidence that the Iranian god Mithra ever had anything to do with killing a bull. &quot; [ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 8 ] [ The bull-slaying scene ] [ Tauroctony ] Tauroctony in Kunsthistorisches Museum In every Mithraeum the centrepiece was a representation of Mithras killing a sacred bull; the so-called tauroctony. { David Ulansey, The origins of the Mithraic mysteries, p. 6 : &quot; Although the iconography of the cult varied a great deal from temple to temple, there is one element of the cult&apos;s iconography which was present in essentially the same form in every mithraeum and which, moreover, was clearly of the utmost importance to the cult&apos;s ideology; namely the so-called tauroctony, or bull-slaying scene, in which the god Mithras, accompanied by a series of other figures, is depicted in the act of killing the bull. &quot; } The image may be a relief, or free-standing, and side details may be present or omitted.

As he does so, he looks over his shoulder towards the figure of Sol. A dog and a snake reach up towards the blood. A scorpion seizes the bull&apos;s genitals. A raven is flying around or is sitting on the bull. Three corns of wheat are seen coming out from the bull&apos;s tail, sometimes from the wound. The bull was often white. The god is sitting on the bull in an unnatural way with his right leg constraining the bull&apos;s hoof and the left leg is bent and resting on the bull&apos;s back or flank.

Anyone familiar with the cult’s iconography will immediately recognize this awkward and possibly unnatural posture as a typical or even essential aspect of the tauroctony.

Outside the cavern, top left, is Sol the sun, with his flaming crown, often driving a quadriga. A ray of light often reaches down to touch Mithras. Top right is Luna, with her crescent moon, who may be depicted driving a biga. { L&apos;Ecole Initiative: Alison Griffith, 1996. &quot; Mithraism &quot; } In some depictions, the central tauroctony is framed by a series of subsidiary scenes to the left, top and right, illustrating events in the Mithras narrative; Mithras being born from the rock, the water miracle, the hunting and riding of the bull, meeting Sol who kneels to him, shaking hands with Sol and sharing a meal of bull-parts with him, and ascending to the heavens in a chariot. In some instances, as is the case in the stucco icon at Santa Prisca mithraeum, the god is shown heroically nude.

Like the general trend in Graeco-Roman art, most if not all tauroctony scenes, regardless of the medium they were executed in, were painted, and the different items of Mithras’ clothing was usually colored in either blue or red, often, as in the painting at Marino, with most of the costume in red with only the inside of the cape being blue and star-speckled. The bull was often white, sometimes wearing the dorsuale, the Roman sacrificial band in reds or browns, while the torchbearers could be depicted in a variety of colors with reds and greens being the most common. ] Some of these reliefs were constructed so that they could be turned on an axis. On the back side was another, more elaborate feasting scene.

On the specific banquet scene on the Fiano Romano relief, one of the torchbearers points a caduceus towards the base of an altar, where flames appear to spring up. Robert Turcan has argued that since the caduceus is an attribute of Mercury, and in mythology Mercury is depicted as a psychopomp, the eliciting of flames in this scene is referring to the dispatch of human souls and expressing the Mithraic doctrine on this matter. Turcan also connects this event to the tauroctony: the blood of the slain bull has soaked the ground at the base of the altar, and from the blood the souls are elicited in flames by the caduceus.

He is usually represented having four wings, two keys (sometimes a single key) and a scepter in his hand. Sometimes the figure is standing on a globe inscribed with a diagonal cross. In the figure shown here, the four wings carry the symbols of the four seasons and a thunderbolt is engraved on the breast. At the base of the statue are the hammer and tongs of Vulcan, the cock and the wand of Mercury. A more scarcely represented variant of the figure with a human head is also found. { von Gall, Hubertus, &quot; The Lion-headed and the Human-headed God in the Mithraic Mysteries, &quot; in Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin ed.

The name of the figure has been deciphered from dedicatory inscriptions to be Arimanius (though the archeological evidence is not very strong), which is nominally the equivalent of Ahriman, a demon figure in the Zoroastrian pantheon. Arimanius is known from inscriptions to have been a god in the Mithraic cult (CIMRM 222 from Ostia, 369 from Rome, 1773 and 1775 from Pannonia). { Jackson, Howard M., &quot; The Meaning and Function of the Leontocephaline in Roman Mithraism &quot; in Numen, Vol. 32, Fasc. 1 (Jul., 1985), pp. 17-45 } While some scholars identify the lion-man as Aion (Zurvan, or Kronos) others assert that it is Ahriman.

[ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 105 The original editor of the text, Albrecht Dieterich, claimed that it recorded an authentic Mithraic ritual, but this claim was rejected by Cumont, who felt that the references to Mithras in the text were merely the result of an extravagant syncretism evident in magical traditions. Until recently, most scholars followed Cumont in refusing to see any authentic Mithraic doctrine in the Mithras Liturgy. ] { Meyer, Marvin W. (1976) The &quot; Mithras Liturgy &quot;. } The walls of Mithraea were commonly whitewashed, and where this survives it tends to carry extensive repositories of graffiti; and these, together with inscriptions on Mithraic monuments, form the main source for Mithraic texts. [ Francis E.D. Hinnells, John R. 1971 &quot; Mithraic graffiti from Dura-Europos, &quot; in Mithraic Studies, vol. 2 Manchester University Press 424–445 ] Nevertheless, it is clear from the archeology of numerous Mithraea that most rituals were associated with feasting – as eating utensils and food residues are almost invariably found. These tend to include both animal bones and also very large quantities of fruit residues. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.115. } The presence of large amounts of cherry-stones in particular would tend to confirm mid-summer (late June, early July) as a season especially associated with Mithraic festivities. The Virunum album, in the form of an inscribed bronze plaque, records a Mithraic festival of commemoration as taking place on 26 June 184. Beck argues that religious celebrations on this date are indicative of special significance being given to the Summer solstice; but equally it may well be noted that, in northern and central Europe, reclining on a masonry plinth in an unheated cave was likely to be a predominantly summertime activity. [ June 2011 ] For their feasts, Mithraic initiates reclined on stone benches arranged along the longer sides of the Mithraeum – typically there might be room for 15 –30  diners, but very rarely many more than 40  men. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.43. } Counterpart dining rooms, or triclinia were to be found above ground in the precincts of almost any temple or religious sanctuary in the Roman empire, and such rooms were commonly used for their regular feasts by Roman &apos;clubs&apos;, or collegia. Mithraic feasts probably performed a very similar function for Mithraists as the collegia did for those entitled to join them; indeed, since qualification for Roman collegia tended to be restricted to particular families, localities or traditional trades, Mithraism may have functioned in part as providing clubs for the unclubbed. [ Burkert Walter 1987 Ancient Mystery Cults Harvard University Press 0-674-03387-6 41 ] However, the size of the Mithraeum is not necessarily an indication of the size of the congregation. Each Mithraeum had several altar s at the further end, underneath the representation of the tauroctony; and also commonly contained considerable numbers of subsidiary altars, both in the main Mithraeum chamber, and in the ante-chamber or narthex. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.49. } These altars, which are of the standard Roman pattern, each carry a named dedicatory inscription from a particular initiate, who dedicated the altar to Mithras &quot; in fulfillment of his vow &quot;, in gratitude for favours received. Burned residues of animal entrails are commonly found on the main altars indicating regular sacrificial use. However, Mithraea do not commonly appear to have been provided with facilities for ritual slaughter of sacrificial animals (a highly specialised function in Roman religion), and it may be presumed that a Mithraeum would have made arrangements for this service to be provided for them in co-operation with the professional victimarius { Price S &amp; Kearns E, Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion, p.568. } of the civic cult. Prayers were addressed to the Sun three times a day and Sunday was especially sacred. [ Antonía Tripolitis Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman age 2002 Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing 978-0-8028-4913-7 55– ] It is doubtful whether Mithraism had a monolithic and internally consistent doctrine. [ Beck Roger The Religion of the Mithras Cult in the Roman Empire London Oxford University Press 0-19-921613-4 2007 Nevertheless, the fact that Porphyry and/or his sources would have had no scruples about adapting or even inventing Mithraic data to suit their arguments does not necessarily mean that they actually did so. It is far more likely that Mithraic doctrine (in the weak sense of the term!) really was what the philosophers said it was... there are no insuperable discrepancies between Mithraic practice and theory as attested in Porphyry and Mithraic practice and theory as archaeology has allowed us to recover them. Even if there were major discrepancies, they would matter only in the context of the old model of an internally consistent and monolithic Mithraic doctrine. ] {, p.87. } It may have varied from location to location. { &quot; Beck on Mithraism &quot;, p. 16 } However, the iconography is relatively coherent. It had no predominant sanctuary or cultic centre; and, although each Mithraeum had its own officers and functionaries, there was no central supervisory authority. In some Mithraea, such as that at Dura Europos wall paintings depict prophets carrying scrolls, [ Hinnells, John R. 1971 Mithraic Studies, vol. 2 Manchester University Press ] { plate 25 } but no named Mithraic sages are known, nor does any reference give the title of any Mithraic scripture or teaching. It is known that intitates could transfer with their grades from one Mithraeum to another. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.139. } [ The Mithraeum ] [ Mithraeum ] { mithraeum found in the ruins of } { Ostia Antica, Italy. } Temples of Mithras are sunk below ground, windowless, and very distinctive. In cities, the basement of an apartment block might be converted; elsewhere they might be excavated and vaulted over, or converted from a natural cave. Mithraic temples are common in the empire; although unevenly distributed, with considerable numbers found in Rome, Ostia, Numidia, Dalmatia, Britain and along the Rhine/Danube frontier; while being somewhat less common in Greece, Egypt, and Syria. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, pages 26 and 27. } According to Walter Burkert, the secret character of Mithriac rituals meant that Mithraism could only be practiced within a Mithraeum. [ Burkert Walter 1987 Ancient Mystery Cults Harvard University Press 0-674-03387-6 10 ] Some new finds at Tienen show evidence of large scale feasting and the mystery religion may not have been as secretive as was generally believed. [ Bjørnebye Jonas Hic locus est felix, sanctus, piusque benignus: The cult of Mithras in fourth century Rome,Dissertation for the degree of philosophiae doctor (PhD) 2007 12, 36 The discovery of a large quantity of tableware as well as animal remains in a pit outside the newly excavated mithraeum at Tienen, Belgium, has also attracted new attention to the topic of Mithraic processions and large-scale feasts, begging a re-examination of the secrecy of the cult and its visibility in local society...provides evidence for large-scale, semi-public feasts outside of the mithraeum itself, suggesting that each mithraeum might have had a far larger following than its relative size would imply. ] For the most part, Mithraea tend to be small, externally undistinguished, and cheaply constructed; the cult generally preferring to create a new centre rather than expand an existing one. The Mithraeum represented the cave in which Mithras carried and then killed the bull; and where stone vaulting could not be afforded, the effect would be imitated with lath and plaster. They are commonly located close to springs or streams; fresh water appears to have been required for some Mithraic rituals, and a basin is often incorporated into the structure. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.73. } There is usually a narthex or ante-chamber at the entrance, and often other ancillary rooms for storage and the preparation of food. The extant mithraea present us with actual physical remains of the architectural structures of the sacred spaces of the Mithraic cult. Mithraeum is a modern coinage and mithraists referred to their sacred structures as speleum or antrum (cave), crypta (underground hallway or corridor), fanum (sacred or holy place), or even templum (a temple or a sacred space). [ Bjørnebye Jonas Hic locus est felix, sanctus, piusque benignus: The cult of Mithras in fourth century Rome,Dissertation for the degree of philosophiae doctor (PhD) The mithraea as buildings 2007 The extant mithraea present us with actual physical remains of the architectural structures of the sacred spaces of the Mithraic cult. While the Mithraists themselves never used the word mithraeum as far as we know, but preferred words like speleum or antrum (cave), crypta (underground hallway or corridor), fanum (sacred or holy place), or even templum (a temple or a sacred space), the word mithraeum is the common appellation in Mithraic scholarship and is used throughout this study ] In their basic form, Mithraea were entirely different from the temples and shrines of other cults. In standard pattern Roman religious precincts, the temple building functioned as a house for the god; who was intended to be able to view through the opened doors and columnar portico, sacrificial worship being offered on an altar set in an open courtyard; potentially accessible not only to initiates of the cult, but also to colitores or non-initiated worshippers. { Price S &amp; Kearns E, Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion, p.493. } Mithraea were the antithesis of this. { Price S &amp; Kearns E, Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion, p.355. } [ Degrees of initiation ] In the Suda under the entry &quot; Mithras &quot;, it states that &quot; no one was permitted to be initiated into them (the mysteries of Mithras), until he should show himself holy and steadfast by undergoing several graduated tests. &quot; { Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p.102. The Suda reference given is 3: 394, M 1045 Adler. } Gregory Nazianzen refers to the &quot; tests in the mysteries of Mithras &quot;. { Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p.102. The Gregory reference given is to Oratio 4. 70. } There were seven grades of initiation into the mysteries of Mithras, which are listed by St. Jerome. { Jerome, Letters 107, ch. 2 (To Laeta) } Manfred Clauss states that the number of grades, seven, must be connected to the planets. A mosaic in the Ostia Mithraeum of Felicissimus depicts these grades, with heraldic emblems that are connected either to the grades or are just symbols of the planets. The grades also have an inscription besides them commending each grade into the protection of the different planetary gods. { M.Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p.132-133 } In ascending order of importance the initiatory grades were: { M.Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p.133-138 } Grade Symbols Associated planet/Protecting deity Corax, Corux or Corvex (raven or crow) beaker, caduceus Mercury Nymphus, Nymphobus (male bride) lamp, bell, veil, circlet/crown ( diadem ) Venus Miles (soldier) pouch, helmet, lance, drum, belt, breast plate Mars Leo (lion) batillum, sistrum, laurel wreath, thunderbolts Jupiter Perses (Persian) akinakes, Phrygian cap, sickle, sickle moon and stars, sling pouch Luna Heliodromus (sun-runner) torch, images of Helios the Sun, whip, robes Sol Pater (father) patera, Mitre, crozier/shepherd&apos;s staff, garnet or ruby ring, chasuble, elaborate robes jewel encrusted with metallic threads Saturn Elsewhere, as at Dura Europos Mithraic graffiti survive giving membership lists, in which initiates of a Mithraeum are named with their Mithraic grades. At Virunum, the membership list or album sacratorum was maintained as an inscribed plaque, updated year by year as new members were initiated. By cross-referencing these lists it is sometimes possible to track initiates from one Mithraeum to another; and also speculatively to identify Mithraic initiates with persons on other contemporary lists - such as military service rolls, of lists of devotees of non-Mithraic religious sanctuaries. Names of initiates are also found in the dedication inscriptions of altars and other cult objects. Clauss noted in 1990 that overall, only about 14% of Mithriac names inscribed before 250 identify the initiates grade - and hence questioned that the traditional view that all initiates belonged to one of the seven grades. [ Clauss Manfred Die sieben Grade des Mithras-Kultes ZPE 82 1990 183–194 ] Clauss argues that the grades represented a distinct class of priests, sacerdotes. Gordon maintains the former theory of Merkelbach and others, especially noting such examples as Dura where all names are associated with a Mithraic grade. Some scholars maintain that practice may have differed over time, or from one Mithraea to another. The highest grade, pater, is far the most common found on dedications and inscriptions - and it would appear not to have been unusual for a Mithraeum to have several persons with this grade. The form pater patrum (father of fathers) is often found, which appears to indicate the pater with primary status. There are several examples of persons, commonly those of higher social status, joining a Mithraeum with the status pater - especially in Rome during the &apos; pagan revival &apos; of the 4th century. It has been suggested that some Mithraea may have awarded honorary pater status to sympathetic dignitaries. [ Griffith Alison Mithraism in the private and public lives of 4th-c. senators in Rome EJMS ] { http://www.uhu.es/ejms/Papers/Volume1Papers/ABGMS.DOC } The initiate into each grade appears to have required to undertake a specific ordeal or test, { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.103. } involving exposure to heat, cold or threatened peril. An &apos;ordeal pit&apos;, dating to the early 3rd century, has been identified in the Mithraeum at Carrawburgh. Accounts of the cruelty of the emperor Commodus describes his amusing himself by enacting Mithriac initiation ordeals in homicidal form. By the later 3rd century, the enacted trials appear to have been abated in rigor, as &apos;ordeal pits&apos; were floored over. Admission into the community was completed with a handshake with the pater, just as Mithras and Sol shook hands. The initiates were thus referred to as syndexioi, those &quot; united by the handshake &quot;. The term is used in an inscription by Proficentius { M. Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p. 42: &quot; That the hand-shaken might make their vows joyfully forever &quot; } and derided by Firmicus Maternus in De errore profanarum religionum, { M.

Reliefs on a cup found in Mainz, [ Ritual, Myth, Doctrine, and Initiation in the Mysteries of Mithras: New Evidence from a Cult Vessel Beck Roger 2000 The Journal of Roman Studies 90 145–180 10.2307/300205 90 300205 ] { Das Mainzer Mithrasgefäß Merkelbach Reinhold 1995 Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik 108 1–6 } appear to depict a Mithraic initiation. On the cup, the initiate is depicted as led into a location where a Pater would be seated in the guise of Mithras with a drawn bow. Accompanying the initiate is a mystagogue, who explains the symbolism and theology to the initiate. The Rite is thought to re-enact what has come to be called the &apos;Water Miracle&apos;, in which Mithras fires a bolt into a rock, and from the rock now spouts water. Roger Beck has hypothesized a third processional Mithraic ritual, based on the Mainz cup and Porphyrys. This so-called Procession of the Sun-Runner features the Heliodromus, escorted by two figures representing Cautes and Cautopates (see below) and preceded by an initiate of the grade Miles leading a ritual enactment of the solar journey around the mithraeum, which was intended to represent the cosmos. [ Martin Luther H. 2004 Ritual Competence and Mithraic Ritual ] { in } [ Wilson Brian C. Religion as a human capacity: a festschrift in honor of E. Thomas Lawson 2004 BRILL ] {, p. 257 } Consequently it has been argued that most Mithraic rituals involved a re-enactment by the initiates of episodes in the Mithras narrative, { Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p.62-101. } a narrative whose main elements were; birth from the rock, striking water from stone with an arrow shot, the killing of the bull, Sol&apos;s submission to Mithras, Mithras and Sol feasting on the bull, the ascent of Mithras to heaven in a chariot. A noticeable feature of this narrative (and of its regular depiction in surviving sets of relief carvings) is the complete absence of female personages. { Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p.33. } [ Membership ] Due to the complete absence of women in membership lists, it is generally believed that the cult was for men only.

The rude discipline of the order did not permit them to take the degrees in the sacred cohorts, and, as among the Mazdeans of the Orient, they occupied only a secondary place in the society of the faithful. Among the hundreds of inscriptions that have come down to us, not one mentions either a priestess, a woman initiate, or even a donatress. ] [ Richard Gordon Lindsay Jones Encyclopedia Of Religion Mithraism 2011-03-31 Second edition 2005 Thomas Gale, Macmillan Reference USA 9 6090...Moreover, not a single woman is listed: the repeated attempts to show that women might belong to the cult are wishful thinking (Piccottini, 1994). ] The ancient scholar Porphyry seems to refer to female mithraists, but the early 20th century historian A.S. Geden writes that this may be due to a misunderstanding. According to Geden, while the participation of women in the ritual was not unknown in the Eastern cults, the predominant military influence in Mithraism seems to render it unlikely in this instance.

Few, if any, initiates came from leading aristocratic or senatorial families until the &apos;pagan revival&apos; of the mid 4th century; but there were always considerable numbers of freedmen and slaves. { Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p.39. } [ Ethics ] Clauss suggests that a statement by Porphyry that people initiated into the Lion grade must keep their hands pure from everything that brings pain and harm and is impure means that moral demands were made upon members of congregations. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.144-145: &quot; Justin&apos;s charge does at least make clear that Mithraic commandments did exist. &quot; } A passage in the Caesares of Julian the Apostate refers to &quot; commandments of Mithras &quot;. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.144, referencing Caesares 336C in the translation of W.C.Wright.

The earliest physical remains of the cult date from around the end of the first century A.D., and Mithraism reached its height of popularity in the third century. ] However, according to Daniels, whether any of this relates to the origins of the mysteries is unclear. { C.M.Daniels, &quot; The role of the Roman army in the spread and practice of Mithraism &quot; in John R. Hinnells (ed) Mithraic Studies: proceedings of the first International congress of Mithraic Studies Manchester university press (1975), vol. 2, p. 250: &quot; Traditionally there are two geographical regions where Mithraism first struck root in the Roman empire: Italy and the Danube. Italy I propose to omit, as the subject needs considerable discussion, and the introduction of the cult there, as witnessed by its early dedicators, seems not to have been military. Before we turn to the Danube, however, there is one early event (rather than geographical location) which should perhaps be mentioned briefly in passing. This is the supposed arrival of the cult in Italy as a result of Pompey the Great&apos;s defeat of the Cilician pirates, who practised &apos;strange sacrifices of their own... and celebrated certain secret rites, amongst which those of Mithra continue to the present time, having been first instituted by them&apos;. Suffice it to say that there is neither archaeological nor allied evidence for the arrival of Mithraism in the West at that time, nor is there any ancient literary reference, either contemporary or later. If anything, Plutarch&apos;s mention carefully omits making the point that the cult was introduced into Italy at that time or by the pirates. &quot; } The unique underground temples or Mithraea appear suddenly in the archaeology in the last quarter of the 1st century AD. { Beck, R., &quot; The Mysteries of Mithras: A New Account of their Genesis &quot;, Journal of Roman Studies, 1998, 115-128. p. 118. } [ Earliest archaeology ] { Stela } Inscriptions and monuments related to the Mithraic Mysteries are catalogued in a two volume work by Maarten J.

These may be the earliest tauroctonies, if they are accepted to be a depiction of Mithras. {...the area [the Crimea] is of interest mainly because of the terracotta plaques from Kerch (five, of which two are in CIMRM as nos 11 and 12). These show a bull-killing figure and their probable date (second half of first-century BC to first half of first AD) would make them the earliest tauroctonies -- if it is Mithras that they portray.

Another reason for not connecting these artifacts with the Mithraic Mysteries is that the first of these plaques was found in a woman&apos;s tomb. { Beskow, Per, The routes of early Mithraism, in Études mithriaques Ed.Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin. p.15: &quot; The plaques are typical Bosporan terracottas... At the same time it must be admitted that the plaques have some strange features which make it debateable if this is really Mithra(s). Most striking is the fact that his genitals are visible as they are in the iconography of Attis, which is accentuated by a high anaxyrides. Instead of the tunic and flowing cloak he wears a kind of jacket, buttoned over the breast with only one button, perhaps the attempt of a not so skillful artist to depict a cloak. The bull is small and has a hump and the tauroctone does not plunge his knife into the flank of the bull but holds it lifted. The nudity gives it the character of a fertility god and if we want to connect it directly with the Mithraic mysteries it is indeed embarrassing that the first one of these plaques was found in a woman&apos;s tomb. &quot; Clauss, p.156: &quot; He is grasping one of the bull&apos;s horns with his left hand, and wrenching back its head; the right arm is raised to deliver the death-blow. So far, this god must be Mithras. But in sharp contrast with the usual representations, he is dressed in a jacket-like garment, fastened at the chest with a brooch, which leaves his genitals exposed - the iconography typical of Attis. &quot; } An altar or block from near SS.

Other early archaeology includes the Greek inscription from Venosia by Sagaris actor probably from 100–150 AD; the Sidon cippus dedicated by Theodotus priest of Mithras to Asclepius, 140-141 AD; and the earliest military inscription, by C. Sacidius Barbarus, centurion of XV Apollinaris, from the bank of the Danube at Carnuntum, probably before 114 AD. [ Gordon Richard L. The date and significance of CIMRM 593 (British Museum, Townley Collection Journal of Mithraic Studies II 1978 148–174 ] { p. 150. } According to C.M.Daniels, the Carnuntum inscription is the earliest Mithraic dedication from the Danube region, which along with Italy is one of the two regions where Mithraism first struck root. { C. M. Daniels, &quot; The Roman army and the spread of Mithraism &quot; in John R. Hinnels, Mithraic Studies: Proceedings of the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies, vol. 2, 1975, Manchester UP, pp.249-274. &quot; The considerable movement [of civil servants and military] throughout the empire was of great importance to Mithraism, and even with the very fragmentary and inadequate evidence that we have it is clear that the movement of troops was a major factor in the spread of the cult. Traditionally there are two geographical regions where Mithraism first struck root: Italy and the Danube. Italy I propose to omit, as the subject needs considerable discussion, and the introduction of the cult there, as witnessed by its early dedicators, seems not to have been military. Before we turn to the Danube, however, there is one early event (rather than geographical location) which should perhaps be mentioned briefly in passing. This is the supposed arrival of the cult in Italy as a result of Pompey the Great&apos;s defeat of Cilician pirates, who practiced &apos;strange sacrifices of their own... and celebrated certain secret rites, amongst which those of Mithras continue to the present time, have been first instituted by them&apos;. (ref Plutarch, &quot; Pompey &quot; 24-25) Suffice it to say that there is neither archaeological nor allied evidence for the arrival of Mithraism in the west at that time, nor is there any ancient literary reference, either contemporary or later. If anything, Plutarch&apos;s mention carefully omits making the point that the cult was introduced into Italy at that time or by the pirates. Turning to the Danube, the earliest dedication from that region is an altar to Mitrhe (sic) set up by C. Sacidus Barbarus, a centurion of XV Appolinaris, stationed at the time at Carnuntum in Pannonia (Deutsch-Altenburg, Austria). The movements of this legion are particularly informative. &quot; The article then goes on to say that XV Appolinaris was originally based at Carnuntum, but between 62-71 transferred to the east, first in the Armenian campaign, and then to put down the Jewish uprising. Then 71- 86 back in Carnuntum, then 86-105 intermittently in the Dacian wars, then 105-114 back in Carnuntum, and finally moved to Cappadocia in 114. } The earliest dateable Mithraeum outside Rome dates from 148 AD. { C. M. Daniels, &quot; The Roman army and the spread of Mithraism &quot; in John R. Hinnels, Mithraic Studies: Proceedings of the First International Congress of Mithraic Studies, vol. 2, 1975, Manchester UP, p. 263. The first dateable Mithraeum outside italy is from Böckingen on the Neckar, where a centurion of the legion VIII Augustus dedicated two altars, one to Mithras and the other (dated 148) to Apollo. } The Mithraeum at Caesarea Maritima is the only one in Palestine and the date is inferred. { Lewis M. Hopfe, &quot; Archaeological indications on the origins of Roman Mithraism &quot;, in Lewis M. Hopfe (ed). Uncovering ancient stones: essays in memory of H. Neil Richardson, Eisenbrauns (1994), pp. 147-158. p.153: &quot; At present this is the only Mithraeum known in Roman Palestine. &quot; p. 154: &quot; It is difficult to assign an exact date to the founding of the Caesarea Maritima Mithraeum. No dedicatory plaques have been discovered that might aid in the dating. The lamps found with the taurectone medallion are from the end of the first century to the late third century A.D. Other pottery and coins from the vault are also from this era. Therefore it is speculated that this Mithraeum developed toward the end of the first century and remained active until the late third century. This matches the dates assigned to the Dura-Europos and the Sidon Mithraea. &quot; } [ Earliest cult locations ] According to Roger Beck, the attested locations of the Roman cult in the earliest phase (c. 80–120 AD) are as follows: { &quot; Beck on Mithraism &quot;, pp. 34–35.

This is by the Latin poet Statius who, writing about 80 A.C., described Mithras as one who &quot; twists the unruly horns beneath the rocks of a Persian cave &quot;. Only a little later (c. 100 A.C.) Plutarch attributed an Anatolian origin to the Mysteries, for according to him the Cilician pirates whom Pompey defeated in 67 B.C. &quot; celebrated certain secret rites, amongst which those of Mithras continue to the present time, having been first instituted by them &quot;. ] [ Statius ] The Thebaid (c.80 AD ) an epic poem by Statius, pictures Mithras in a cave, wrestling with something that has horns. { Statius: Thebaid 1.719 to 720 J.H.Mozey&apos;s translation at Classical E-Text Latin text at The Latin Library } The context is a prayer to the god Phoebus. { The prayer begins at Statius Thebaid 1.696 J.H.Mozey&apos;s translation at Classical E-Text Latin text at The Latin Library } The cave is described as persei, which in this context is usually translated &quot; Persian &quot;, however according to the translator J.H.Mozley it literally means &quot; Persean &quot;, referring to Perses the son of Persius and Andromeda; [ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 29 ] this Perses being the ancestor of the Persians according to Greek legend. [ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 27 to 29 ] [ Plutarch ] The Greek biographer Plutarch (46 - 127 AD) says that &quot; secret mysteries... of Mithras &quot; were practiced by the pirates of Cilicia, the coastal province in the southeast of Anatolia, who were active in the 1st century BC: &quot; They likewise offered strange sacrifices; those of Olympus I mean; and they celebrated certain secret mysteries, among which those of Mithras continue to this day, being originally instituted by them. &quot; { ( &apos;&apos;Life of Pompey&apos;&apos; 24, referring to events c. 68 BC). } He mentions that the pirates were especially active during the Mithridatic wars (between the Roman Republic and King Mithridates VI of Pontus ) in which they supported the king. The association between Mithridates and the pirates is also mentioned by the ancient historian Appian. { App. Mith 14.92 cited in } [ Ulansey David Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries Oxford UP 1991 New York 0-19-506788-6 89 ] The 4th century commentary on Vergil by Servius says that Pompey settled some of these pirates in Calabria in southern Italy. { E.D.Francis &quot; Plutarch&apos;s Mithraic pirates &quot;.

(Tiridates was the son of Vonones II of Parthia, and his coronation by Nero in 66 AD confirmed the end of a war between Parthia and Rome.) Dio Cassius writes that Tiridates, as he was about to receive his crown, told the Roman emperor that he revered him &quot; as Mithras &quot;. { Dio Cassius 63.5.2 } Roger Beck thinks it possible that this episode contributed to the emergence of Mithraism as a popular religion in Rome. [ http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithraism Mithraism 2011-05-15 Beck Roger 20-07-2002 Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition In the Cumontian scenario this episode cannot mark the definitive moment of transfer, for Mithraism in that scenario was already established in Rome, albeit on a scale too small to have left any trace in the historical or archaeological record. Nevertheless, it could have been a spur to Mithraism’s emergence on to the larger stage of popular appeal. ] [ Porphyry ] The philosopher Porphyry (3rd-4th century AD) gives an account of the origins of the Mysteries in his work De antro nympharum (The Cave of the Nymphs). Citing Eubulus as his source, Porphyry writes that the original temple of Mithras was a natural cave, containing fountains, which Zoroaster found in the mountains of Persia. To Zoroaster, this cave was an image of the whole world, so he consecrated it to Mithras, the creator of the world. Later in the same work, Porphyry links Mithras and the bull with planets and star-signs: Mithras himself is associated with the sign of Aries and the planet Mars, while the bull is associated with Venus. { Porphyry, De antro nympharum 11: &quot; Hence, a place near to the equinoctial circle was assigned to Mithra as an appropriate seat. And on this account he bears the sword of Aries, which is a martial sign. He is likewise carried in the Bull, which is the sign of Venus. For Mithra. as well as the Bull, is the Demiurgus and lord of generation. &quot; } Porphyry is writing close to the demise of the cult, and Robert Turcan has challenged the idea that Porphyry&apos;s statements about Mithraism are accurate. His case is that far from representing what Mithraists believed, they are merely representations by the Neoplatonists of what it suited them in the late 4th century to read into the mysteries. { Turcan, Robert, Mithras Platonicus, Leiden, 1975, via Beck, R. Merkelbach&apos;s Mithras p. 301-2. } However, Merkelbach and Beck believe that Porphyry&apos;s work &quot; is in fact thoroughly coloured with the doctrines of the Mysteries. &quot; { Beck, R. Merkelbach&apos;s Mithras p. 308 n. 37. } Beck holds that classical scholars have neglected Porphyry&apos;s evidence and have taken an unnecessarily skeptical view of Porphyry. [ Roger Beck Luther H.

One, John Hinnells, was the organizer of the conference... Of more importance in the long run, however, was the even more radical paper presented by R.L.Gordon... ] John Hinnells was unwilling to reject entirely the idea of Iranian origin, { John R. Hinnells, &quot; Reflections on the bull-slaying scene &quot; in Mithraic studies, vol. 2, p. 303-4 : &quot; Nevertheless we would not be justified in swinging to the opposite extreme from Cumont and Campbell and denying all connection between Mithraism and Iran. &quot; } but wrote: &quot; we must now conclude that his reconstruction simply will not stand.

Hinnells, &quot; Reflections on the bull-slaying scene &quot; in Mithraic studies, vol. 2, p. 303-4 : &quot; Since Cumont&apos;s reconstruction of the theology underlying the reliefs in terms of the Zoroastrian myth of creation depends upon the symbolic expression of the conflict of good and evil, we must now conclude that his reconstruction simply will not stand. It receives no support from the Iranian material and is in fact in conflict with the ideas of that tradition as they are represented in the extant texts. Above all, it is a theoretical reconstruction which does not accord with the actual Roman iconography. What, then, do the reliefs depict? And how can we proceed in any study of Mithraism? I would accept with R. Gordon that Mithraic scholars must in future start with the Roman evidence, not by outlining Zoroastrian myths and then making the Roman iconography fit that scheme.... Unless we discover Euboulus&apos; history of Mithraism we are never likely to have conclusive proof for any theory. Perhaps all that can be hoped for is a theory which is in accordance with the evidence and commends itself by (mere) plausibility. &quot; } He discussed Cumont&apos;s reconstruction of the bull-slaying scene and stated &quot; that the portrayal of Mithras given by Cumont is not merely unsupported by Iranian texts but is actually in serious conflict with known Iranian theology. &quot; { John R. Hinnells, &quot; Reflections on the bull-slaying scene &quot; in Mithraic studies, vol. 2, p. 292: &quot; Indeed, one can go further and say that the portrayal of Mithras given by Cumont is not merely unsupported by Iranian texts but is actually in serious conflict with known Iranian theology. Cumont reconstructs a primordial life of the god on earth, but such a concept is unthinkable in terms of known, specifically Zoroastrian, Iranian thought where the gods never, and apparently never could, live on earth. To interpret Roman Mithraism in terms of Zoroastrian thought and to argue for an earthly life of the god is to combine irreconcilables. If it is believed that Mithras had a primordial life on earth, then the concept of the god has changed so fundamentally that the Iranian background has become virtually irrelevant. &quot; } Another paper by R. L. Gordon argued that Cumont severely distorted the available evidence by forcing the material to conform to his predetermined model of Zoroastrian origins. Gordon suggested that the theory of Persian origins was completely invalid and that the Mithraic mysteries in the West was an entirely new creation. { R.L.Gordon, &quot; Franz Cumont and the doctrines of Mithraism &quot; in John R. Hinnells, Mithraic studies, vol. 1, p. 215 f } A similar view has been expressed by Luther H.

Reviewed by Peter Edwell, Macquarie University, Sydney 14-06-2011 Edwell Peter The study of the ancient mystery cult of Mithraism has been heavily influenced over the last century by the pioneering work of Franz Cumont followed by that of M. J. Vermaseren. Ever since Cumont&apos;s volumes first appeared in the 1890s, his ideas on Mithraism have been influential, particularly with regard to the quest for Mithraic doctrine. His emphasis on the Iranian features of the cult is now less influential with the Iranising influences generally played down in scholarship over the last thirty years.

Speidel, Mithras-Orion: Greek Hero and Roman Army God, Brill Academic Publishers (August 1997), ISBN 90-04-06055-3 } While proposing the theory, Beck says that his scenario may be regarded as Cumontian in two ways. Firstly, because it looks again at Anatolia and Anatolians, and more importantly, because it hews back to the methodology first used by Cumont. [ http://azargoshnasp.net/Din/mysteriesofmithra.pdf The mysteries of Mithras: A new account of their genesis 2011-03-23 Beck Roger...It may properly be called a &apos;Cumontian scenario&apos; for two reasons: first, because it looks again to Anatolia and Anatolians; secondly, and more importantly, because it hews to the methodological line first set by Cumont. ] Merkelbach suggests that its mysteries were essentially created by a particular person or persons { Beck, R., 2002: &quot; Discontinuity’s weaker form of argument postulates re-invention among and for the denizens of the Roman empire (or certain sections thereof), but re-invention by a person or persons of some familiarity with Iranian religion in a form current on its western margins in the first century AD. Merkelbach (1984: pp. 75-77), expanding on a suggestion of M.P. Nilsson, proposes such a founder from eastern } { Anatolia, working in court circles in Rome. So does Beck 1998, with special focus on the dynasty of Commagene (see above). Jakobs 1999 proposes a similar scenario. &quot; } and created in a specific place, the city of Rome, by someone from an eastern province or border state who knew the Iranian myths in detail, which he wove into his new grades of initiation; but that he must have been Greek and Greek-speaking because he incorporated elements of Greek Platonism into it. The myths, he suggests, were probably created in the milieu of the imperial bureaucracy, and for its members. { Reinhold Merkelbach, Mithras, Konigstein, 1984, ch. 75-7 } Clauss tends to agree. Beck calls this &quot; the most likely scenario &quot; and states &quot; Till now, Mithraism has generally been treated as if it somehow evolved Topsy -like from its Iranian precursor – a most implausible scenario once it is stated explicitly. &quot; { Beck, R., &quot; Merkelbach&apos;s Mithras &quot;, p. 304, 306. } Archaeologist Lewis M. Hopfe notes that there are only three Mithraea in Roman Syria, in contrast to further west. He writes: &quot; Archaeology indicates that Roman Mithraism had its epicenter in Rome... the fully developed religion known as Mithraism seems to have begun in Rome and been carried to Syria by soldiers and merchants. &quot; Lewis M. Hopfe, &quot; Archaeological indications on the origins of Roman Mithraism &quot;, in Lewis M. Hopfe (ed). Uncovering ancient stones: essays in memory of H. Neil Richardson, Eisenbrauns (1994), pp. 147-158. p. 156: &quot; Beyond these three Mithraea [in Syria and Palestine], there are only a handful of objects from Syria that may be identified with Mithraism. Archaeological evidence of Mithraism in Syria is therefore in marked contrast to the abundance of Mithraea and materials that have been located in the rest of the Roman Empire. Both the frequency and the quality of Mithraic materials is greater in the rest of the empire. Even on the western frontier in Britain, archaeology has produced rich Mithraic materials, such as those found at Walbrook. If one accepts Cumont&apos;s theory that Mithraism began in Iran, moved west through Babylon to Asia Minor, and then to Rome, one would expect that the cult left its traces in those locations. Instead, archaeology indicates that Roman Mithraism had its epicenter in Rome. Wherever its ultimate place of origin may have been, the fully developed religion known as Mithraism seems to have begun in Rome and been carried to Syria by soldiers and merchants. None of the Mithraic materials or temples in Roman Syria except the Commagene sculpture bears any date earlier than the late first or early second century. [footnote in cited text: 30. Mithras, identified with a Phrygian cap and the nimbus about his head, is depicted in colossal statuary erected by King Antiochus I of Commagene, 69-34 B.C.. (see Vermaseren, CIMRM 1.53-56). However, there are no other literary or archaeological evidences to indicate that the religion of Mithras as it was known among the Romans in the second to fourth centuries A.D. was practiced in Commagene]. While little can be proved from silence, it seems that the relative lack of archaeological evidence from Roman Syria would argue against the traditional theories for the origins of Mithraism. &quot; Taking a different view from other modern scholars, Ulansey argues that the Mithraic mysteries began in the Greco-Roman world as a religious response to the discovery by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus of the astronomical phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes – a discovery that amounted to discovering that the entire cosmos was moving in a hitherto unknown way. This new cosmic motion, he suggests, was seen by the founders of Mithraism as indicating the existence of a powerful new god capable of shifting the cosmic spheres and thereby controlling the universe. { Ulansey, D., &apos;&apos;The origins of the Mithraic mysteries &quot;, p. 77f. } However, A. D. H. Bivar, L. A. Campbell and G. Widengren have variously argued that Roman Mithraism represents a continuation of some form of Iranian Mithra worship. [ http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithraism Mithraism 16-05-2011 Beck Roger 20-07-2002 Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition The time has come to review the principal scholarship which has argued for transmission and continuity based on the postulated similarities... three argue for continuity in the strongest terms. A.D.H. Bivar (1998, and earlier studies mentioned there) argues that western Mithraism was but one of several manifestations of Mithra-worship current in antiquity across a wide swathe of Asia and Europe. L.A. Campbell (1968) argues in the Cumontian tradition... extraordinarily detailed and learned form of Zoroastrian Mazdaism. A continuity as thoroughgoing, though not quite so systematic ideologically, was proposed in several studies by G. Widengren (1965: pp. 222-32; 1966; 1980).. ] According to Antonia Tripolitis, Roman Mithraism originated in Vedic India and picked up many features of the cultures which it encountered in its westward journey. [ Antonía Tripolitis Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman age 2002 Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing 978-0-8028-4913-7 3– It originated in Vedic, India, migrated to Persia by way of Babylon, and then westward through the Hellenized East, and finally across the length and breadth of the Hellenistic-Roman world. On its westward journey, it incorporated many of the features of the cultures in which it found itself. ] [ Later history ] The first important expansion of the mysteries in the Empire seems to have happened quite quickly, late in the reign of Antoninus Pius and under Marcus Aurelius. By this time all the key elements of the mysteries were in place. [ Gordon Richard L. The date and significance of CIMRM 593 (British Museum, Townley Collection Journal of Mithraic Studies II 1978 148–174 ] {. pp.150-151: &quot; The first important expansion of the mysteries in the Empire seems to have occurred relatively rapidly late in the reign of Antoninus Pius and under Marcus Aurelius (9). By that date, it is clear, the mysteries were fully institutionalised and capable of relatively stereotyped self-reproduction through the medium of an agreed, and highly complex, symbolic system reduced in iconography and architecture to a readable set of &apos;signs&apos;. Yet we have good reason to believe that the establishment of at least some of those signs is to be dated at least as early as the Flavian period or in the very earliest years of the second century. Beyond that we cannot go... &quot; } Sol Invictus in Museo archeologico (Milan) Mithraism reached the apogee of its popularity during the 2nd and 3rd centuries, spreading at an &quot; astonishing &quot; rate at the same period when Sol Invictus became part of the state. { Beck, R., Merkelbach&apos;s Mithras, p.299; Clauss, R., The Roman cult of Mithras, p. 25: &quot;... the astonishing spread of the cult in the later second and early third centuries AD... This extraordinary expansion, documented by the archaeological monuments... &quot; } At this period a certain Pallas devoted a monograph to Mithras, and a little later Euboulus wrote a History of Mithras, although both works are now lost. { Clauss, R., The Roman cult of Mithras, p. 25, referring to Porphyry, De Abstinentia, 2.56 and 4.16.3 (for Pallas) and De antro nympharum 6 (for Euboulus and his history). } According to the 4th century Historia Augusta, the emperor Commodus participated in its mysteries [ Loeb D. Magie Scriptores Historiae Augustae: Commodus 1932 ] { pp. IX.6: Sacra Mithriaca homicidio vero polluit, cum illic aliquid ad speciem timoris vel dici vel fingi soleat &quot; He desecrated the rites of Mithras with actual murder, although it was customary in them merely to say or pretend something that would produce an impression of terror &quot;. } but it never became one of the state cults. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p. 24: &quot; The cult of Mithras never became one of those supported by the state with public funds, and was never admitted to the official list of festivals celebrated by the state and army - at any rate as far as the latter is known to us from the Feriale Duranum, the religious calendar of the units at Dura-Europos in Coele Syria; &quot; [where there was a Mithraeum] &quot; the same is true of all the other mystery cults too. &quot; He adds that at the individual level, various individuals did hold roles both in the state cults and the priesthood of Mithras. } [ The end of Roman Mithraism ] It is difficult to trace when the cult of Mithras came to an end. Beck states that &quot; Quite early in the [fourth] century the religion was as good as dead throughout the empire. &quot; { Beck, R., Merkelbach&apos;s Mithras, p. 299. } Inscriptions from the 4th century are few. Clauss states that inscriptions show Mithras as one of the cults listed on inscriptions by Roman senators who had not converted to Christianity, as part of the &quot; pagan revival &quot; among the elite. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p. 29-30: &quot; Mithras also found a place in the &apos;pagan revival&apos; that occurred, particularly in the western empire, in the latter half of the fourth century AD. For a brief period, especially in Rome, the cult enjoyed, along with others, a last efflorescence, for which we have evidence from among the highest circles of the senatorial order. One of these senators was Rufius Caeionius Sabinus, who in 377 dedicated an altar &quot; to a long list of gods including Mithras. } Ulansey holds that &quot; Mithraism declined with the rise to power of Christianity, until the beginning of the fifth century, when Christianity became strong enough to exterminate by force rival religions such as Mithraism. &quot; [ http://www.well.com/user/davidu/mithras.html The Cosmic Mysteries of Mithras 2011-03-20 Ulansey David Mithraism declined with the rise to power of Christianity, until the beginning of the fifth century, when Christianity became strong enough to exterminate by force rival religions such as Mithraism. ] According to Speidel, Christians fought fiercely with this feared enemy and suppressed it during the 4th century. Some Mithraic sanctuaries were destroyed and religion was no longer a matter of personal choice. [ Michael Speidel Mithras-Orion: Greek hero and Roman army god http://books.google.com/books?id%3D7-YUAAAAIAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA1 27 March 2011 1980 Brill 978-90-04-06055-5 1– As a mystery religion it engulfed the Roman empire during the first four centuries of our era. Mithraic sanctuaries are found from Roman Arabia to Britain, from the Danube to the Sahara, wherever the Roman soldier went. Christian apologetics fiercely fought the cult they feared., and during the late fourth century A.D., as a victim of the Judaeo-Christian spirit of intolerance, Roman Mithraism was suppressed, its sanctuaries destroyed together with the last vestiges of religious freedom in the empire. ] According to Luther H. Martin, Roman Mithraism came to an end with the anti-pagan decrees of the Christian emperor Theodosius during the last decade of the 4th century. [ Martin Luther H. Beck Roger Beck on Mithraism: Collected Works With New Essays Foreward Ashgate Publishing December 30, 2004 xiii 978-0-7546-4081-3 However, the cult was vigorously opposed by Christian polemicists, especially by Justin and Tertullian, because of perceived similarities between it and early Christianity. And with the anti-pagan decrees of the Christian emperor Theodosius during the final decade of the fourth century, Mithraism disappeared from the history of religions as a viable religious practice. ] At some of the mithraeums which have been found below churches, for example the Santa Prisca mithraeum and the San Clemente mithraeum, the ground plan of the church above was made in a way to symbolize Christianity&apos;s domination of Mithraism. [ Vermaseren M. J.

One cannot fail to see the symbolism of this arrangement, which expresses in concrete terms that Christ keeps Mithras &quot; under &quot;. The same also applies at S. Clemente. ] According to Mark Humphries, the deliberate concealment of Mithraic cult objects in some areas suggests that precautions were being taken against Christian attacks. However, in areas like the Rhine frontier, purely religious considerations cannot explain the end of Mithraism and barbarian invasions may also have played a role. [ humphries mark Susan Ashbrook Harvey, David G. Hunter The Oxford handbook of early Christian studies http://books.google.com/books?id%3D0-ovhYLJkRYC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA95 3 April 2011 10 December 2008 Oxford University Press 978-0-19-927156-6 95– In some instances, the deliberate concealment of Mithraic cult objects could suggest precautions were being taken against Christian attacks; but elsewhere, such as along the Rhine frontier, coin sequences suggest that Mithraic shrines were abandoned in the context of upheavals resulting from barbarian invasions, and that purely religious considerations cannot explain the end of Mithraism in that region (Sauer 1996). ] There is virtually no evidence for the continuance of the cult of Mithras into the 5th century. In particular large numbers of votive coins deposited by worshippers have been recovered at the Mithraeum at Pons Sarravi (Sarrebourg) in Gallia Belgica, in a series that runs from Gallienus (253-68) to Theodosius I (379-395). These were scattered over the floor when the Mithraeum was destroyed, as Christians apparently regarded the coins as polluted; and they therefore provide reliable dates for the functioning of the Mithraeum. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, pp. 31-32. } It cannot be shown that any Mithraeum continued in use in the 5th century. The coin series in all Mithraea end at the end of the 4th century at the latest. The cult disappeared earlier than that of Isis. Isis was still remembered in the middle ages as a pagan deity, but Mithras was already forgotten in late antiquity. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.171. } Cumont stated in his book that Mithraism may have survived in certain remote cantons of the Alps and Vosges into the 5th century. [ Cumont Franz The Mysteries of Mithra McCormack, Thomas J. (trans.) 1903 Chicago Open Court 0-486-20323-9 ] { pp. 206 : &quot; A few clandestine conventicles may, with stubborn persistence, have been held in the subterranean retreats of the palaces. The cult of the Persian god possibly existed as late as the fifth century in certain remote cantons of the Alps and the Vosges. For example, devotion to the Mithraic rites long persisted in the tribe of the Anauni, masters of a flourishing valley, of which a narrow defile closed the mouth. &quot; This is unreferenced; but the French text in Textes et monuments figurés relatifs aux mystères de Mithra tom. 1, p. 348 has a footnote. } [ Interpretations of the bull-slaying scene ] According to Franz Cumont, the imagery of the tauroctony was a Graeco-Roman representation of an event in Zoroastrian cosmogony described in a 9th century AD Zoroastrian text, the Bundahishn. In this text the evil spirit Ahriman (not Mithras) slays the primordial creature Gavaevodata which is represented as a bovine. { The Greater [Bundahishn] IV.19-20 : &quot; 19. He let loose Greed, Needfulness, [Pestilence,] Disease, Hunger, Illness, Vice and Lethargy on the body of, Gav&apos; and Gayomard. 20. Before his coming to the &apos;Gav&apos;, Ohrmazd gave the healing Cannabis, which is what one calls &apos;banj&apos;, to the&apos; Gav&apos; to eat, and rubbed it before her eyes, so that her discomfort, owing to smiting, [sin] and injury, might decrease; she immediately became feeble and ill, her milk dried up, and she passed away. &quot; } Cumont held that a version of the myth must have existed in which Mithras, not Ahriman, killed the bovine. But according to Hinnells, no such variant of the myth is known, and that this is merely speculation: &quot; In no known Iranian text [either Zoroastrian or otherwise] does Mithra slay a bull &quot; [ Hinnels John R.

But the things contained in the cavern being arranged according to commensurate intervals, were symbols of the mundane elements and climates. &quot; } The ceiling of the Caesarea Maritima Mithraeum retains traces of blue paint, which may mean the ceiling was painted to depict the sky and the stars. { Lewis M.

He sees iconographic and mythological parallels between the two figures: both are young heroes, carry a dagger and wear a Phrygian cap. He also mentions the similarity of the image of Perseus killing the Gorgon and the tauroctony, both figures being associated with underground caverns and both having connections to Persia as further evidence. { Ulansey, D., &apos;&apos;The origins of the Mithraic mysteries &quot;, p. 25-39. } Sol and Mithras banqueting with Luna and the twin divinities Cautes and Cautopates, his attendants.

Speidel, Mithras-Orion: Greek Hero and Roman Army God, Brill Academic Publishers (August 1997), ISBN 90-04-06055-3 } Beck has criticized Speidel and Ulansey of adherence to a literal cartographic logic, describing their theories as a &quot; will-o&apos;-the-wisp &quot; which &quot; lured them down a false trail. &quot; { Beck, Roger, &quot; In the place of the lion: Mithras in the tauroctony &quot; in &apos;&apos;Beck on Mithraism: collected works with new essays &quot; (2004), p. 270-276. } He argues that a literal reading of the tauroctony as a star chart raises two major problems: it is difficult to find a constellation counterpart for Mithras himself (despite efforts by Speidel and Ulansey) and that unlike in a star chart, each feature of the tauroctony might have more than a single counterpart. Rather than seeing Mithras as a constellation, Beck argues that Mithras is the prime traveller on the celestial stage (represented by the other symbols of the scene), the Unconquered Sun moving through the constellations. But again, Meyer holds that the Mithras Liturgy reflects the world of Mithraism and may be a confirmation for Ulansey&apos;s theory of Mithras being held responsible for the precession of equinoxes.

Almost all Mithraea contain statues dedicated to gods of other cults, and it is common to find inscriptions dedicated to Mithras in other sanctuaries, especially those of Jupiter Dolichenus. { Clauss, M., The Roman cult of Mithras, p.158. } Mithraism was not an alternative to Rome&apos;s other traditional religions, but was one of many forms of religious practice; and many Mithraic initiates can also be found participating in the civic religion, and as initiates of other mystery cults.
