The population was 19,738 according to the 2010 census. [ http://factfinder2.census.gov Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), New Canaan town, Connecticut U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder 2 August 9, 2011 ] The town is one of the most affluent communities in the nation. In 2011, New Canaan was ranked 8th on CNN Money &apos;s list of the top-earning towns in the United States. { http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/moneymag/1108/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/8.html } New Canaan has two Metro-North railroad stations: the New Canaan station and the Talmadge Hill station, both on the New Canaan Branch of the New Haven Line. Travel time to Grand Central Terminal in New York City is approximately one hour. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 22.5 sqmi ], of which [ 22.1 sqmi ] is land and [ 0.3 sqmi ], or 1.56%, is water. The town is served by the Merritt Parkway and by a spur line of the Metro-North Railroad. The downtown area consists of many restaurants, an old movie theater, and antique shops. There are also several churches in town, as well as the historic Roger Sherman Inn. The town is bounded on the north by Lewisboro and Pound Ridge in Westchester County, New York, on the east by Wilton, on the southeast by Norwalk, on the south by Darien and on the southwest and west by Stamford. The town includes the following sections: New Canaan center, Talmadge Hill, Ponus, Smith Ridge Road, Pinneys Corners, and part of Silvermine (which extends into Norwalk and Wilton). [ History ] { John Warner Barber } New Canaan train station In 1731, Connecticut&apos;s colonial legislature established Canaan Parish as a religious entity in northwestern Norwalk and northeastern Stamford. The right to form a Congregational church was granted to the few families scattered through the area. As inhabitants of Norwalk or Stamford, Canaan Parish settlers still had to vote, pay taxes, serve on juries, and file deeds in their home towns. Because Canaan Parish was not planned as a town, New Canaan, when incorporated in 1801, found itself without a central common, a main street or a town hall. { New Canaan Advertiser web site, web page for &quot; The Answer Book, April 22, 2006, accessed August 2, 2006 } Until the Revolutionary War, New Canaan was primarily an agricultural community. After the war, New Canaan&apos;s major industry was shoe making. As New Canaan&apos;s shoe business gathered momentum early in the nineteenth century, instead of a central village, regional settlements of clustered houses, mill, and school developed into distinct district centers. Some of the districts were centered on Ponus Ridge, West Road, Oenoke Ridge, Smith Ridge, Talmadge Hill and Silvermine, a pattern which the village gradually outgrew. With the 1868 advent of the railroad to New Canaan, many of New York City &apos;s wealthy residents discovered the quiet, peaceful area and built magnificent summer homes. Eventually, many of the summer visitors settled year-round, commuting to their jobs in New York City and creating the residential community that exists today. Lewis Lapham, a founder of Texaco and great-grandfather of long-time Harper&apos;s Magazine editor Lewis H. Lapham, spent summers with his family at their estate that is now [ 300 acre km2 on ] Waveny Park next to Talmadge Hill and the Merritt Parkway. [ The &quot; Harvard Five &quot; and modern homes ] New Canaan was an important center of the modern design movement from the late 1940s through roughly the 1960s, when about 80 modern homes were built in town. About 20 have been torn down since then. { &quot; Architect for All Seasons &quot;, by David Gurliacci, Fairfield County Business Journal, January 9, 2006. } &quot; During the late 1940s and 50s, a group of students and teachers from the Harvard Graduate School of Design migrated to New Canaan... and rocked the world of architectural design &quot;, according to an article in PureContemporary.com, an online architecture design magazine. &quot; Philip Johnson, Marcel Breuer, Landis Gores, John M. Johansen and Eliot Noyes known as the Harvard Five began creating homes in a style that emerged as the complete antithesis of the traditional build. Using new materials and open floor plans, best captured by Johnson&apos;s Glass House, these treasures are being squandered as buyers are knocking down these architectural icons and replacing them with cookie-cutter new builds. &quot; { PureContemporary.com accessed July 2, 2006 } &quot; Other architects, well known ( Frank Lloyd Wright, for example) and not so well known, also contributed significant modern houses that elicited strong reactions from nearly everyone who saw them and are still astonishing today  ... New Canaan came to be the locus of the modern movement&apos;s experimentation in materials, construction methods, space, and form &quot;, according to an online description of The Harvard Five in New Canaan: Mid-Century Modern Houses, by William D. Earls. { http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393731839/102-8451043-6653762?v=glance &amp; n=283155 From a brief description on Amazon.com of &quot; The Harvard Five in New Canaan: Mid-Century Modern Houses by Marcel Breuer, Landis Gores, John Johansen, Philip Johnson, Eliot Noyes &quot; by William D.
