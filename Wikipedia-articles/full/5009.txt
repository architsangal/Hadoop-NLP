[ Danio rerio March 2007 ] It is a popular aquarium fish, frequently sold under the trade name zebra danio, and is an important vertebrate model organism in scientific research. [ 3 ] [ Taxonomy ] The zebrafish are Cyprinidae with a derived member of the genus Danio. It has a sister group relationship with Danio kyathit. Zebrafish are closely related to the genus Devario, as demonstrated by a phylogenetic tree of close species. [ http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n3/fig_tab/6800867f2.html#figure-title Figure 2. Phylogenetic relationships among danios ] [ Distribution ] The zebrafish is native to the streams of the southeastern Himalayan region, [ Mayden Richard L.

Zebrafish have been introduced to parts of the United States, presumably by deliberate release or by escape from fish farms. They have also been sighted in Colombia. [ Description ] A young zebrafish (&apos;&apos;Danio rerio&apos;&apos;) The fish is named for the five uniform, pigmented, horizontal blue stripes on the side of the body, all of which extend to the end of the caudal fin. Its shape is fusiform and laterally compressed, with its mouth directed upwards. Males are torpedo -shaped and have gold stripes between the blue stripes; females have a larger, whitish belly and have silver stripes instead of gold. Adult females will exhibit a small genital papilla in front of the anal fin origin. The zebrafish can grow to [ 6.4 cm in ], although it is uncommon for them to grow past 4  cm in captivity. Life-span in captivity is around 2–3 years, although in ideal conditions, may extend to 5 years. [ Reproduction ] The approximate generation time for the Danio is 3–4 months. A male must be present for ovulation and spawning to occur. Females are able to spawn at intervals of 2–3 days, laying hundreds of eggs in each clutch. Upon release, embryonic development begins; absent sperm, growth stops after the first few cell divisions. Fertilized eggs almost immediately become transparent, a characteristic that makes D. rerio a convenient research model species. [ Spence R, Gerlach G, Lawrence C, Smith C The behaviour and ecology of the zebrafish, Danio rerio Biological Reviews 83 1 13–34 2008 February 18093234 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00030.x ] Development progresses rapidly. Precursors to all major organs appear within 36 hours of fertilization, and hatching takes place 12–36 hours later, depending on the embryo&apos;s internal conditions and the external temperature, ideally [ 28.5 °C °F ]. Swimming and feeding behavior begin about 36 hours later. The sex of juveniles cannot be distinguished except by dissection, and sex determinants are not clearly understood. [ Stimulated spawning ] To encourage the fish to spawn, some researchers use a fish tank with a sliding bottom insert. The insert reduces the depth in the pool. The technique is most effective in the early morning, given that ovulation and spawning are enhanced by light. The researchers have been able to collect 10,000 embryos in 10 minutes. Male zebrafish, for instance, respond to more pronounced markings, i.e., &quot; good stripes &quot;, but in a group males will mate with whatever they can find. What attracts females is not currently understood. The presence of plants, even plastic plants, also encourages spawning.

It primarily eats zooplankton, insects, insect larva e, and phytoplankton. It can eat a variety of other foods, such as worms and small crustacean s, if its preferred sources are not readily available. Most danios accept common food flakes and tubifex worm s in the aquarium. [ Strains ] Recently, transgenic zebrafish have become commercially available that express green, red, and yellow fluorescent protein s. They are tradenamed GloFish; other cultivated varieties include &apos;golden&apos;, &apos;sandy&apos;, &apos;longfin&apos; and &apos;leopard&apos;. The leopard danio, previously known as Danio frankei, is a spotted colour morph of the zebrafish caused by a pigment mutation. [ Watanabe M, Iwashita M, Ishii M, et al.

[ Mills, Dick Eyewitness Hnbk Aquarium Fish Harper Collins 1993 0-7322-5012-9 ] [ Wild-type strains ] The Zebra Fish Information Network { ZFIN } provides up-to-date information about current known wild-type (WT) strains of D. rerio.

Danio pigment pattern diversity and phenotypes of D. rerio hybrids with other danios. Photos } [ Aquarium care ] Zebrafish are hardy fish and considered good for beginner aquarists. Their decades of popularity can also be attributed to their playful disposition, [ 10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00012.x ] as well as their rapid breeding, beauty, price, and broad availability. They thrive best in [ 22 - 28 C F ] water. They need an aquarium of [ 10 USgal L ] or more, and they do well in schools. They also thrive as shoals of six or more, and interact well with other fish type s in the aquarium. However, they are susceptible to Oodinium or velvet disease, microsporidia (Pseudoloma neurophilia), and Mycobacterium species. Given the opportunity, adults eat hatchlings, which may be protected by separating the two groups with a net, breeding box or separate tank. [ In scientific research ] { chromatophore s, shown here mediating } { background adaptation, are studied by scientists } D. rerio is a common and useful model organism for studies of vertebrate development and gene function. George Streisinger at the University of Oregon established its utility. Success with it in large scale forward genetic screen s (commonly referred to as the Tübingen/Boston screens) consolidated its importance. The scholarly journal Development { Development journal } devoted an issue [ Zebrafish issue Development 123 1 1996 December http://dev.biologists.org/content/vol123/issue1/ ] to research using it in celebration of this landmark. It has a dedicated online database of genetic, genomic, and developmental information, the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN). D. rerio is one of the few fish species to have reached space. They may supplement higher vertebrate models, such as rats and mice. { mutagenesis. See link for pigmentation mutants of D rerio: Figure 5. Pigment pattern mutants within D. rerio.

Heart muscle regeneration does not make use of stem cell s; instead, mature heart muscle cells regress to a stem-cell-like state and redifferentiate. In 2011, the British Heart Foundation ran an advertising campaign (including on television and on line) publicising their intention to study the applicability of this ability to humans by &quot; spend[ing] £50 million on a programme of groundbreaking research that could help us begin to repair damaged [human] hearts. &quot; [ http://www.bhf.org.uk/research/mending-broken-hearts-appeal/the-science.aspx?pid%3Dp%26amp%3Bsc_cid%3DMBH-EX-24%26amp%3Butm_source%3DMBH-AW%26amp%3Butm_medium%3DMBH-AW%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3DMBH-AW-G9_010211%26amp%3Bgclid%3DCL2w_L2hhqcCFcgf4QodBA25eA British Heart Foundation – The science behind the appeal Bhf.org.uk February 16, 2007 February 11, 2012 ] Zebrafish have also been found to regenerate photoreceptor cells and retina l neurons following injury, which has been shown to be mediated by the dedifferentiation and proliferation of Müller glia. [ 17596452 ] The exact molecular mechanisms of this regeneration are unknown. Researchers frequently amputate the dorsal and ventral tail fins and analyze their regrowth to test for mutations. This research is leading the scientific community in the understanding of healing/repair mechanisms in vertebrates. It has also been found if the same fin is damaged enough times, the fish will grow a new fin which will have mutated only a small amount. Most scientists believe this is a defence mechanism to try to prevent the fin from being damaged again. [ June 2010 ] [ Genetics ] [ Gene expression ] Due to their short lifecycles and relatively large clutch sizes, zebrafish are a useful model for genetic studies. A common reverse genetics technique is to reduce gene expression or modify splicing using Morpholino antisense technology. Morpholino oligonucleotide s (MO) are stable, synthetic macromolecules that contain the same bases as DNA or RNA; by binding to complementary RNA sequences, they reduce the expression of specific genes. The journal Genesis { genesis – The Journal of Genetics and Development } devoted an issue [ Zebrafish issue Genesis 30 3 2001 July http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/85006212 ] to research using MO, mostly in D. rerio. MO can be injected into one cell of an embryo after the 32-cell stage, reducing gene expression in only cells descended from that cell. However, cells in the early embryo (less than 32 cells) are interpermeable to large molecules, [ Kimmel CB, Law RD Cell lineage of zebrafish blastomeres. I.

A known problem with gene knockdowns is that, because the genome underwent a duplication after the divergence of ray-finned fish es and lobe-finned fish es, it is not always easy to silence the activity one of the two gene paralog s reliably due to complementation by the other paralog. Despite the complications of the zebrafish genome, a number of commercially available global platforms for analysis of both gene expression by microarrays and promoter regulation using ChIP-on-chip exist. [ Gene sequencing ] In 2009, researchers at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi announced the sequencing of a wild caught strain, containing 1.7 billion genetic letters. { Decoding the Genome Mystery } { Indian Express, July 5, 2009. } { Genome@IGIB } { Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) } [ Mitochondrial DNA ] In October 2001, researchers from the University of Oklahoma published D. rerio&apos;s complete mitochondrial DNA sequence.

This is within 100 base pairs of other related species of fish, and it is notably only 18 pairs longer than the goldfish (Carassius auratus) and 21 longer than the carp (Cyprinus carpio). Its gene order and content are identical to the common vertebrate form of mitochondrial DNA. It contains 13 protein -coding genes and a noncoding control region containing the origin of replication for the heavy strand. In between a grouping of five tRNA genes, a sequence resembling vertebrate origin of light strand replication is found. It is difficult to draw evolutionary conclusions because it is difficult to determine whether base pair changes have adaptive significance via comparisons with other vertebrates nucleotide sequences. [ Pigmentation gene ] In December 2005, a study of the golden strain identified the gene responsible for its unusual pigmentation as SLC24A5, a solute carrier that appeared to be required for melanin production, and confirmed its function with a Morpholino knockdown. The orthologous gene was then characterized in humans and a one base pair difference was found to strongly segregate fair-skinned Europeans and dark-skinned Africans.

Construction of transgenic zebrafish is rather easy by a method using the Tol2 transposon system. [ 10.1016/j.devcel.2004.06.005 Kawakami, K, et al.

The modified fish turn green if they are placed into water that is polluted by estrogen. Fudan scientists turn fish into estrogen alerts } [ In medical research ] In cardiovascular research the zebrafish is being used to model blood clotting, blood vessel development, heart failure, and congenital heart and kidney disease. In programmes of research into acute inflammation, a major underpinning process in many diseases, researchers have established a zebrafish model of inflammation, and its resolution. An approach that allows detailed study of the genetic controls of inflammation and the possibility of identifying potential new drugs. Another focus of work is to understand how a gene called Hedgehog, a biological signal that underlies a number of human cancers, controls cell growth. This is fast becoming an avenue of research that is leading to new cancer therapies. In probing disorders of the nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases, movement disorders, psychiatric disorders and deafness, researchers are using the zebrafish to understand how the genetic defects underlying these conditions cause functional abnormalities in the human brain, spinal cord and sensory organs.Researchers are delving into the complexities of muscle degeneration in genetic models of human musculoskeletal diseases, such as muscular dystrophy. These studies exemplify how zebrafish research offers unique opportunities to understanding some of the greatest challenges in medical science, by enabling new discoveries of how cells and tissues work to be translated into new ways of understanding a broad range of human diseases. Finally, and as demonstrated through ongoing research programmes, the zebrafish models affords an ideal opportunity, not only to identify novel candidates for genes underlying human disease, but offers a potential system in which to begin to develop novel therapeutic agents in drug discovery programmes, hence helping to identify new treatments. [ http://www.fishforscience.com/ Fish for Science University of Sheffield 2011 March 19, 2011 ] [ Repairing retinal damage ] Another well studied curiosity of the zebra fish is that they possess four types of cone cell – with ultraviolet supplementing the red, green and blue cone cell subtypes humans&apos; have evolved – bestowing them with the ability to observe a vast spectrum of colours. The species is also studied to better understand the development of the retina, in particular how the cone cells of the retina become arranged into the so called &apos;cone mosaic&apos;; zebrafish, in addition to certain other teleost fish, are particularly noted for having extreme precision of cone cell arrangement during biological development. 1 This study of the zebrafish&apos;s retinal characteristics has also extrapolated into medical enquiry. In 2007, researchers at University College London grew a type of zebrafish adult stem cell found in the eyes of fish and mammals that develops into neuron s in the retina —the part of the eye that sends messages to the brain. These cell s could be injected in the eye to treat diseases that damage retinal neurons—nearly every disease of the eye, including macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetes -related blindness. Retinal damage is responsible for most cases of sight loss. The researchers studied Müller glial cells in the eyes of humans aged from 18 months to 91 years and were able to develop them into all types of retinal neurons. They were able to grow them easily in the lab. The stem cells successfully migrated into diseased rats&apos; retinas and took on the characteristics of the surrounding neurons. The team is working on the same approach in humans. { Zebra fish may point way to cure for blindness } { The China Post Friday, August 3, 2007. } [ Transparent adult bodies ] In 2008, researchers at Children&apos;s Hospital Boston developed a new strain of zebrafish, named Casper, whose adult bodies were transparent.

Because many gene functions are shared between fish and humans, Casper is expected to yield insight into human diseases such as leukemia and other cancers. { livescience.com } [ See also ] The subfamily Danionin ae Development of fish: post-fertilization development and axes formation Regional_specification#Fish List of freshwater aquarium fish species See-through frog GloFish [ References ] [ 2 ] [ Further reading ] [ 163699 Danio rerio November 12, 2004 ] [ Lambert, Derek J Freshwater Aquarium Fish Edison, New Jersey Chartwell Books 1997 19 0-7858-0867-1 ] [ Sharpe, Shirlie Zebra Danio Your Guide to Freshwater Aquariums http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/cyprinids2/p/zebradanio.htm December 15, 2004 ] [ Kocher TD, Jeffery WR, Parichy DM, Peichel CL, Streelman JT, Thorgaard GH Special feature—roundtable discussion.
