On June 18, 2008, a British Airways Boeing 737-400 (operated by Comair ), operating as Flight 6203 from Johannesburg, skidded off the runway at Durban International Airport while landing under adverse weather conditions. The aircraft was reported to have hit a wet patch on the tarmac, causing it to skid and resulting in the right landing-gear becoming embedded in the surrounding earth. The incident caused the closure of the airport for both arrivals and departures for several hours. All 87 passengers and six crew members escaped without serious injury.

[ Plans ] The airport will be used by the South African Air Force and the Police Air Wing during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, before being decommissioned. Although it is currently unclear as to what the future usage of the airport site will be, it is widely expected that the site will be used for future industrial development. The site is located on a large parcel of flat land in the Durban South Industrial Basin, which is already home to much of the city&apos;s heavy industry; given Durban&apos;s generally very hilly terrain, such a large, flat parcel is ideal for future industrial development, port expansion, or both.
