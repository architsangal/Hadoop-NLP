Biggert is one of 171 of the 178 Republican U.S. House members in the 111th Congress to have signed Grover Norquist &apos;s Americans for Tax Reform Taxpayer Protection Pledge: Current Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers &quot; I Judy Biggert pledge to the taxpayers of the 13th Congressional District, of the state of Illinois, and to all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes. &quot; Biggert supports making all of the Bush tax cuts permanent, regardless of income, because everyone has suffered during the recession. Biggert supports the partial privatization of Social Security, in which individuals could choose to voluntarily divert 2% of their Social Security tax payments from paying Social Security beneficiaries into individual private accounts which they could invest in the stock market and which they could pass on to their heirs. Biggert&apos;s own belief that citizens should be allowed to set up personal accounts and invest their own Social Security taxes in the stock market got plenty of attention Tuesday from congressional leaders. Biggert supports the repeal (or defunding to prevent implementation) of the 2010 Democratic health care reform and its replacement with Republican health care reform. Biggert opposes allowing individuals less than 65 years of age to buy into Medicare. She opposes public funding of congressional campaigns, which Hynes favors, and opposes President Clinton&apos;s proposal to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare. Question: What should Congress do to ensure continued viability of Medicare? Judy Biggert: The first thing we should not do is lower the Medicare eligibility age to 55, as the president has proposed. Biggert opposes any comprehensive immigration reform that provides a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and supports the message sent by Arizona SB 1070. Biggert opposes public financing of federal election campaigns, and supports the elimination of all limits on campaign contributions with immediate and full disclosure of contributions. Hynes has voiced support for public funding of congressional campaigns, a proposal Biggert opposes. Biggert favors an end to the limits on campaign contributions—now $1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for political action committees—but would require quicker disclosure of all donations. Biggert supports repeal of the &quot; Don&apos;t Ask, Don&apos;t Tell &quot; policy, but opposes repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act which prohibits federal recognition of same-sex marriages. [ Political campaigns ] [ 1998 ] In 1998, Biggert narrowly defeated conservative state Senator Peter Roskam in the Republican primary, the real contest in this ancestrally Republican district. Biggert earned 61% of the vote to win the seat opened up by the retirement of U. S. Representative Harris Fawell. In 2006, Roskam was elected to Congress from another district. [ 2006 ] In 2006, Biggert&apos;s share of the vote in the general election fell below 60% for the first time in her Congressional career. [ 2008 ] In 2008, Biggert received less than 54% of the vote overall (and less than 50% of the vote in Will County ) in winning reelection to her sixth term in Congress in her first general election campaign against a financially competitive opponent, businessman Scott Harper. In 2008, Democratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin was reelected with 60% of the vote and Democrat Barack Obama won 54% of the vote in the 13th Congressional District, with even Biggert&apos;s Republican predecessor, Fawell, supporting Obama.
