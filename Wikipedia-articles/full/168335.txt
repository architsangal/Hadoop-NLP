He was born in the Isle of Man to English parents, the second-eldest of five siblings. With his younger brothers, twins Robin and Maurice, he formed the Bee Gees, one of the most successful pop groups of all time. Their younger brother Andy was also a popular singer. The trio got their start in Australia, and found their major success when they returned to England. Known for his high-pitched falsetto singing voice, Gibb shares the record with John Lennon and Paul McCartney for consecutive Billboard Hot 100 Number Ones as a writer with six. The book of Guinness World Records lists Barry Gibb as the second most successful songwriter in history behind Paul McCartney.

Barry Gibb was born to Barbara and Hugh Gibb (d. 1992) in the Isle of Man. He has an older sister, Lesley (b. 1945), and had three younger brothers, fraternal twins Robin (1949–2012) and Maurice (1949–2003), and Andy (1958–1988). He and his family moved to Chorlton-cum-Hardy in Manchester in 1953. When he was 12 years old, his family moved to Brisbane, Australia, settling in one of the city&apos;s poorest suburbs, Cribb Island. The suburb was later bulldozed to make way for Brisbane Airport. It was in Australia that Gibb and his brothers Robin and Maurice started performing as the Bee Gees. The Gibb family returned to England in 1967. Shortly afterward, the Bee Gees became international stars. [ Career ] Gibb had a highly successful career as a member of the Bee Gees, a group which ranks sixth on the all-time top-sellers list. When the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, their citation read &quot; Only Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees &quot;.

It reigned as the top-selling album until Michael Jackson &apos;s Thriller. They are the only group in pop history to write, produce, and record six straight No. 1 hits. They have 16 Grammy nominations and nine Grammy wins. Barry Gibb is also a prolific and successful songwriter. In 1977, Gibb saw five of his songs simultaneously enter the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100, and for one week in March, four of the top five songs were written by him. His songs were No. 1 for 27 out of 37 weeks from 24 December 1977 to 2 September 1978. As a songwriter Gibb has had No. 1 songs in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, when &quot; (Barry) Islands in the Stream &quot; became number 1 in the UK as the Comic Relief single for 2009. His songs have been recorded by numerous artists, including José Feliciano, Al Green, Wyclef Jean, Janis Joplin, Jimmy Little, Barry Manilow, Olivia Newton-John, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross, Nina Simone, Barbra Streisand, Tina Turner, Conway Twitty, Frankie Valli, Luther Vandross, Sarah Vaughn, Jennifer Warnes, Dionne Warwick, and Andy Williams.

The line &apos;the kid&apos;s no good&apos; features in a Bee Gees song by Barry Gibb, &quot; Come Home Johnny Bride &quot;, on the 1973 album Life in a Tin Can. This is most likely the intended line-up, though available sources differ as to the placement of the first and last tracks. Bootleg versions add a number of additional tracks, and one claims to be a Polydor release. &quot; I&apos;ll Kiss Your Memory &quot; and &quot; This Time &quot; were released on a single (Polydor in much of the world, Atco in North America), which did not chart. A second single of &quot; One Bad Thing &quot; and &quot; The Day Your Eyes Meet Mine &quot; was pressed by Atco Canada but not released.
