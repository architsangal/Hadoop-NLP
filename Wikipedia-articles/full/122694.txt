It was originally called Miller&apos;s Landing after Philip Miller, an early settler. New Haven is within the Hermann AVA ( American Viticultural Area ). [ History ] New Haven was founded in 1836 as a riverboat stop on the Missouri River first called &quot; Miller&apos;s Landing. &quot; Founder Phillip Miller operated a wood yard on the river to fuel the steamboat trade. In the 1850s the arrival of the Union Pacific railroad brought increased commerce and economic activity to the area. In 1856, town fathers changed the name from Miller&apos;s Landing to &quot; New Haven &quot;, reflecting the growth of the town from its origins as a steamboat stop. German immigrants helped settle the area through the 19th century, many of them coming from the Borgholzhausen, Germany area in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Today, New Haven maintains an active Sister-City partnership with Borgholzhausen. New Haven continued to grow through the 20th century. The town has several churches built in the 19th century and early 20th century. Much of the original downtown district, dating from the late 19th century, remains. Both the downtown area, as well as a residential neighborhood near downtown, are listed on the [National Register of Historic Places]. An Arts District has been established in the downtown and features a variety of Artisans. New Haven&apos;s history is promoted and preserved by two museums: the John Colter Museum downtown and the Springgate Museum in the Old New Haven Elementary School, hosted by the New Haven Preservation Society. Nearby Röbller Vineyard and Winery is included in the Hermann AVA and is on the Hermann Wine Trail. Together with other vineyards on the north side of the Missouri River, this area is part of the Missouri Rhineland.
