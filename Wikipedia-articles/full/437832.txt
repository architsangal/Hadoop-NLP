It is approximately two miles out of the city centre, to the north west along the A660 road. Headingley is notable for being the location of the Beckett Park campus for Leeds Metropolitan University and Headingley Stadium. [ History ] The Centre of Headingley &apos;&apos;&apos;The Original Oak&apos;&apos;&apos;, named after the Skyrack Oak which grew opposite. { Wapentake. } Terrace houses typical of the Southern districts of Headingley. Headingley is first mentioned in the Domesday Book as Hedingelei or Hedingeleia in 1086 where it is recorded Ilbert de Lacy held 7 carucates (about 840 acres) of land. The name is widely thought to mean &quot; clearing of Hedda&apos;s people &quot;, with the -ley suffix identifying an Anglo-Saxon origin and Hedda sometimes being identified with Saint Hædde. [ http://www.britannia.com/bios/saints/haedda.html St. Haedda Britannia.com 2008-01-05 ] However, a stone coffin found near Beckett Park in 1995 suggests there may have been an earlier settlement in late Roman or post-Roman times. From Viking times, Headingley was the centre of the wapentake of Skyrack, or Siaraches, the &quot; Shire oak &quot;. The name may refer to an oak tree that was used as a meeting place for settling legal disputes and raising armies. An ancient oak, said to be the Shire Oak, stood to the north of St Michael&apos;s Church until 1941, and gives its name to two pubs, The Original Oak and The Skyrack. [ http://www.headingleytoday.co.uk/yourheadingley/History.1560099.jp Weldrake Dave History: The development of Headingley 2008-01-05 ] During the 13th century William de Poiteven gave land in Headingley to Kirkstall Abbey, and in 1341 the remainder of the township of Headingley-cum-Burley was given to the monastery by the then owner, John de Calverley. The shire oak in 1890. A map of 1711 shows Headingley as having a chapel, cottages, and farmsteads scattered around a triangle of land formed by the merging of routes from north, west and south. Enclosed fields were situated around the settlement with a large tract of common land, Headingley Moor, to the north. In an 1801 census, Headingley&apos;s population is given as 300. An 1829 Act of Parliament enclosed Headingley Moor and the land was placed for sale. Around 30 workers&apos; cottages had by then encroached upon the fringes of the moor prior to 1829. Land in this vicinity was generally cheaper than that at Headingley Hill as it failed to attract the building of affluent villas. This brought about the building of smaller terraced housing around Moor Road and Cottage Road. In the mid 19th century, Far Headingley had begun to develop over what was largely unclaimed common land. Headingley continued to be a village until the expansion of Leeds during the industrial revolution and became a popular suburb where the rich moved to escape the filth and pollution of the city. In 1840, it became the site of Leeds&apos; Zoological and Botanical Gardens. Despite the opening of Headingley railway station, serving the gardens, in 1849, the zoo was a loss-making venture and closed in 1858. The bear pit still survives and can be seen on Cardigan Road. { Thumbnail of the bear pit } The Meanwood Beck, to the east of the village, was a source of water for the early inhabitants and later provided a source of power for the Victorians of Leeds. The Leeds Tramway terminated at a depot at Far Headingley from 1875 to 1959, improving the accessibility of Headingley from Leeds city centre. Improved transport facilitated further growth and attracted many more affluent middle class inhabitants. The tramway perhaps ended Headingley&apos;s village status and made it into a suburb of Leeds. With exception of Beckett Park and the surrounding area, most of Headingley had been developed by the beginning of the twentieth century. In a 1911 census the population of Headingley was in excess of 46,000. The area has a history of student inhabitation, with Leeds Metropolitan University having a campus at Beckett Park in Headingley. Much of the housing around Kirkstall Lane is rented to students. The conversion of Leeds Polytechnic into a University and its subsequent growth has brought about an increased student population in Headingley in the last ten years. Throughout Headingley&apos;s modern era, the Rugby and Cricket stadiums have been significant in the fabric of the area. A major England test match or a Rugby League derby brings many spectators to the area. The cricket ground has been enlarged in recent years to maintain its eligibility for test matches while in 2006 the Eastern terraces on the Rugby ground were replaced with the current Carnegie stand. The winter shed cricket pavilion has been replaced with a new stand and media centre. [ University district ] As Headingley is close to both the University of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan University campuses, it has become a very popular student area. This has had both positive and negative consequences on the local population and environment. The biggest complaints against students (and increasingly, young professionals) relate to the use of multiple-occupancy houses which are prone to burglary, often neglected by landlords and occupants alike and are typically left unoccupied during university holidays. However, the student population has brought money into the area, improved public transport and, generally, made it a more desirable place to live for a portion of the population. [ January 2010 ] Family areas still exist such as in Far Headingley or the Triangle near the Co-op on Cardigan Rd. [ Sports ] [ Headingley Stadium Leeds Rhinos Leeds Carnegie Yorkshire County Cricket Club ] Headingley Stadium cricket ground during an England game. The Carnegie Stand at Headingley Stadium rugby ground. [ Professional ] Headingley is also known in sporting circles — its stadium (known as Headingley ) is home to the Yorkshire County Cricket Club as well as the Leeds Rhinos rugby league and Leeds Carnegie rugby union clubs. Headingley is also the home of the FA Chartership Team of the Year 2006, Old Headingley. The team currently plays in the West Yorkshire League Division 1. Old Headingley recently won the Barkston Ash FA Cup on 9 April 2007, winning the final 2 –0 against Sherburn White Rose. For many decades the Headingley Stadium remained largely unchanged, however since 2000 the cricket ground has been nearly entirely rebuilt in order to retain test ground status. The winter shed was demolished in 2008 and replaced by a new stand and media centre, giving the approach to the north entrance a distinctive and modern waymark. The rugby ground also saw development with the building of the Carnegie Stand which replaced the former Eastern Terraces. This was built with co-operation from Leeds Metropolitan University who retain lecture rooms in the building. The South Stand has a reduced capacity for 2009 as repairs are needed to the front of the terraces, { http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/leeds-rhinos-news/LEEDS-RHINOS-Patchup-planned-for.4634574.jp } this has brought about the consideration of replacing either the South Stand or Western Terraces. The Yorkshire Evening Post reported that the &apos;safety concerns were likely to lead to the stand being demolished and rebuilt&apos;.The North Stand of the rugby ground was the preferential stand to be redeveloped, however as it backs onto the cricket ground it required mutual co-operation. Yorkshire County Cricket Club preferred to redevelop the dilapidated Winter Shed instead. [ Amateur ] Headingley also boasts an amateur Association Football team, Old Headingley AFC which is made up of engineering students from Leeds Metropolitan University. The club nearly folded after losing its home ground, however in 2008, the club was offered a new ground by the University of Bradford. { http://www.headingleytoday.co.uk/oldheadingley/Old-Headingley-AFC-Club-goes.4419431.jp } There is also an amateur cricket club in Far Headingley. [ Politics ] Politically, almost all of Headingley is in the Leeds North West constituency. The current Member of Parliament (MP) is Greg Mulholland ( Liberal Democrat ), who became the first Liberal Democrat MP in West Yorkshire in the 2005 General Election. At a local government level, the ward of Headingley has two Liberal Democrat councillors, Martin Hamilton (2010 –2014) and Jamie Matthews (2008 –2012), and one Labour councillor, Neil Walshaw ( 2011 -2015).

The area&apos;s Woolworths closed in the 1990s. Until the 1980s, the Arndale Centre boasted a bowling alley. The Arndale Centre began undergoing an external facelift in 2009. The nearest large supermarket is a Morrisons in Kirkstall, approximately a mile away from the centre of Headingley.
