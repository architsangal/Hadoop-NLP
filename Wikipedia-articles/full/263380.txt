[ May 2011 Talk:Homosexuality_and_psychology#Needs_Outside-USA_Data_And_Perspectives article USA ] [ Psychology Sexuality LGBT studies November 2008 ] Psychology was one of the first disciplines to study homosexuality as a discrete phenomenon. Prior to and throughout most of the 20th century, common standard psychology viewed homosexuality in terms of pathological models as a mental illness. That classification began to be subjected to critical scrutiny in the research, which consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as a disorder or abnormality. As a result of such accumulated research, professionals in medicine, mental health, and the behavioral and social sciences, opposing the classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder, claimed the conclusion that it was inaccurate, and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions that were based on once-prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples which consisted of patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system. { Case No. S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of California, In re Marriage Cases Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4365(…) } Since the 1970s, the consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions globally is that homosexuality is a normal variation of human sexual orientation, while there remain those who maintain that it is a disorder. { American Psychological Association: Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation } In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder. The American Psychological Association Council of Representatives followed in 1975. [ Bayer Ronald Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis 1987 Princeton University Press Princeton 0-691-02837-0 ] [ September 2010 ] Thereafter other major mental health organizations followed and it was finally declassified by the World Health Organization in 1990. Consequently, while some still believe homosexuality is a mental disorder, the current research and clinical literature demonstrate that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality, reflecting the official positions of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association. [ Major areas of psychological research ] Major psychological research into homosexuality is divided into five categories: What causes some people to be attracted to their own sex? What causes discrimination against people with a homosexual orientation and how can this be influenced? Does having a homosexual orientation affect one&apos;s health status, psychological functioning or general well-being? What determines successful adaptation to rejecting social climates? Why is homosexuality central to the identity of some people, but peripheral to the identity of others? How do the children of homosexual people develop? Psychological research in these areas has been important to counteracting prejudicial attitudes and actions, and to the gay and lesbian rights movement generally. [ T. Sandfort Lesbian and Gay Studies: An Introductory, Interdisciplinary Approach 2 2000 978-0-7619-5417-0 ] [ Etiology of homosexuality ] [ September 2009 ] [ Biology and sexual orientation Environment and sexual orientation ] Numerous different theories have been proposed to explain the development of homosexuality, but there is so far no universally accepted account of the origins of a homosexual sexual orientation. { LeVay, Simon (1996). Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality. Cambridge: The MIT Press ISBN 0-262-12199-9 } [ September 2010 ] [ Discrimination ] [ May 2008 ] [ Homophobia Societal attitudes toward homosexuality ] Anti-gay attitudes and behaviors (sometimes called homophobia or heterosexism) have been objects of psychological research. Such research usually focuses on attitudes hostile to gay men, rather than attitudes hostile to lesbians. Anti-gay attitudes are often found in those who do not know gay people on a personal basis. { National Affirmation Annual Conference: &quot; Homosexuality: A Psychiatrist&apos;s Response to LDS Social Services &quot;, September 5, 1999 } There is also a high risk for anti-gay bias in psychotherapy with lesbian, gay, and bisexual clients. { Cabaj, R; Stein, T. eds. Textbook of Homosexuality and Mental Health, p. 421 } One study found that &quot; families with a strong emphasis on traditional values – implying the importance of religion, an emphasis on marriage and having children – were less accepting of homosexuality than were low-tradition families. &quot; { Newman and Muzzonigro (1993) } One study found that parents who respond negatively to their child&apos;s sexual orientation tended to have lower self-esteem and negative attitudes toward women, and that &quot; negative feelings about homosexuality in parents decreased the longer they were aware of their child&apos;s homosexuality. &quot; { Holtzen and Agresti (1990). } One study found that nearly half of its sample had been the victim of verbal or physical violence because of their sexual orientation, usually committed by men. Such victimization is related to higher levels of depression, anxiety, anger, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. { Herek, et al. (1997) } [ Mental health issues ] [ section Citations merely list author and date, with no additional information. December 2009 ] Psychological research in this area includes examining mental health issues (including stress, depression, or addictive behavior) faced by gay and lesbian people as a result of the difficulties they experience because of their sexual orientation, physical appearance issues, eating disorders, or gender atypical behavior. Psychiatric disorders: In a Dutch study, gay men reported significantly higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders than straight men, and lesbians were significantly more likely to experience depression (but not other mood or anxiety disorders) than straight women. Sandfort, et al. (1999) Physical appearance and eating disorders: Gay men tend to be more concerned about their physical appearance than straight men. Brand, et al. (1992). Lesbian women are at a lower risk for eating disorders than heterosexual women. Siever (1994). Gender atypical behavior: While this is not a disorder, gay men may face difficulties due to being more likely to display gender atypical behavior than heterosexual men. Hiatt and Hargrave (1994). The difference is less pronounced between lesbians and straight women. Finlay and Scheltema (1991) Minority stress : Stress caused from a sexual stigma, manifested as prejudice and discrimination, is a major source of stress for people with a homosexual orientation. Sexual-minority affirming groups and gay peer groups help counteract and buffer minority stress. Ego-dystonic sexual orientation: Conflict between religious identity and sexual orientation identity can cause severe stress, causing some people to want to change their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation identity exploration can help individuals evaluate the reasons behind the desire to change and help them resolve the conflict between their religious and sexual identity, either through sexual orientation identity reconstruction or affirmation therapies. Therapists are to offer acceptance, support, and understanding of clients and the facilitation of clients’ active coping, social support, and identity exploration and development, without imposing a specific sexual orientation identity outcome. Ego-dystonic sexual orientation is a disorder where a person wishes their sexual orientation were different because of associated psychological and behavioral disorders. Sexual relationship disorder: People with a homosexual orientation in mixed-orientation marriage s may struggle with the fear of the loss of their marriage. Therapists should focus exploring the underlying personal and contextual problems, motivations, realities, and hopes for being in, leaving, or restructuring the relationship and should not focus solely on one outcome such as divorce or marriage. Sexual relationship disorder is a disorder where the gender identity or sexual orientation interferes with maintaining or forming of a relationship. [ Suicide ] [ Suicide ] The likelihood of suicide attempts is higher in both gay males and lesbians, as well as bisexual individuals of both sexes, when compared to their heterosexual counterparts.

Race and age play a factor in the increased risk. The highest ratios for males are attributed to young Caucasians. By the age of 25, their risk is is more than halved; however, the risk for black gay males at that age steadily increases to 8.6 times more likely. Over a lifetime, the increased likelihoods are 5.7 times for white and 12.8 for black gay and bisexual males. Lesbian and bisexual females have the opposite trend, with fewer attempts during the teenager years compared to heterosexual females. Through a lifetime, the likelihood for Caucasian females is nearly triple that of their heterosexual counterparts; however, for black females there is minimal change (less than 0.1 to 0.3 difference), with heterosexual black females having a slightly higher risk throughout most of the age-based study. Gay and lesbian youth who attempt suicide are disproportionately subject to anti-gay attitudes, often have fewer skills for coping with discrimination, isolation, and loneliness, { Rotheram-Boris, et al. (1994); Proctor and Groze (1994) } and were more likely to experience family rejection [ Ryan C, Huebner D, Diaz RM, Sanchez J Family rejection as a predictor of negative health outcomes in white and Latino lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults Pediatrics 123 1 346–52 2009 January 19117902 10.1542/peds.2007-3524 ] than those who do not attempt suicide.

Psychologists often say this process includes several stages &quot; in which there is an awareness of being different from peers (&apos;sensitization&apos;), and in which people start to question their sexual identity (&apos;identity confusion&apos;). Subsequently, they start to explore practically the option of being gay, lesbian or bisexual and learn to deal with the stigma (&apos;identity assumption&apos;). In the final stage, they integrate their sexual desires into a position understanding of self (&apos;commitment&apos;). &quot; However, the process is not always linear Rust (1993) and it may differ for lesbians, gay men and bisexual individuals. Monteflores and Schultz (1978). Different degrees of coming out: One study found that gay men are more likely to be out to friends and siblings than to co-workers, parents, and more distant relatives.

For women who self-identify as lesbian, the more people know about her sexual orientation, the less anxiety, more positive affectivity, and greater self-esteem she has.

Much research has documented the lack of correlation between parents&apos; sexual orientation and any measure of a child&apos;s emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with one or more gay parents. [ Pawelski JG, Perrin EC, Foy JM, et al.

After exploration, a patient may proceed with sexual orientation identity reconstruction, which helps a patient reconstruct sexual orientation identity. Psychotherapy, support group s, and life events can influence identity development; similarly, self-awareness, self-conception, and identity may evolve during treatment. It can change sexual orientation identity (private and public identification, and group belonging), emotional adjustment (self-stigma and shame reduction), and personal beliefs, values and norms (change of religious and moral belief, behavior and motivation).
