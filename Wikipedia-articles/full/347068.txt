[ May 2010 ] [ Rumpelstiltskin Rumpelstiltskin.jpg Andrew Lang &apos;s The Blue Fairy Book, (1889) Tom Tit Tot Päronskaft Repelsteeltje 500 Germany England Sweden Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tales English Fairy Tales ] Rumpelstiltskin is the eponymous character and antagonist of a fairy tale that originated in Germany (where he is known as Rumpelstilzchen). The tale was collected by the Brothers Grimm, who first published it in the 1812 edition of Children&apos;s and Household Tales. It was subsequently revised in later editions. [ Plot ] In order to make himself appear more important, a miller lied to a king, telling him that his daughter could spin straw into gold. The king called for the girl, shut her in a tower room with straw and a spinning wheel, and demanded that she spin the straw into gold by morning, for three nights, or be executed (other versions have the king threatening to lock her up in a dungeon forever). She had given up all hope, when an impish creature appeared in the room and spun straw into gold for her in return for her necklace, then again the following night for her ring. On the third night, when she had nothing with which to reward him, the strange creature spun straw into gold for a promise that the girl&apos;s first-born child would become his. The king was so impressed that he married the miller&apos;s daughter, but when their first child was born, the imp returned to claim his payment: &quot; Now give me what you promised. &quot; The queen was frightened and offered him all the wealth she had if she could keep the child. The imp refused but finally agreed to give up his claim to the child if the queen could guess his name in three days. At first she failed, but before the final night, her messenger discovered the imp&apos;s remote mountain cottage and, unseen, overheard the imp hopping about his fire and singing. While there are many variations in this song, the 1886 translation by Lucy Crane reads: &apos;&apos;Today do I bake, to-morrow I brew, &apos;&apos;The day after that the queen&apos;s child comes in; &apos;&apos;And oh! I am glad that nobody knew &apos;&apos;That the name I am called is Rumpelstiltskin! Household Stories by the Brothers Grimm by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm, Translated by Lucy Crane (Macmillan and Company, 1886) However, most American children today know it as: [ May 2012 ] &apos;&apos;Today I brew, tomorrow I bake; &apos;&apos;And then the Prince child I will take; &apos;&apos;For no one knows my little game &apos;&apos;That Rumpelstiltskin is my name! (German: &apos;&apos;Heute back ich, morgen brau ich, &apos;&apos;Übermorgen hol ich mir der Königin ihr Kind; &apos;&apos;Ach, wie gut, dass niemand weiß, &apos;&apos;dass ich Rumpelstilzchen heiß) &quot; Rumpelstilzchen &quot; in Projekt Gutenberg, German translation When the imp came to the queen on the third day and she revealed his name, Rumpelstiltskin lost his bargain. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales, Rumpelstiltskin then &quot; ran away angrily, and never came back &quot;. The ending was revised in a final 1857 edition to a more gruesome version where Rumpelstiltskin &quot; in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two. &quot; Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking ladle (Heidi Anne Heiner). [ February 2012 ] [ Variants ] The same story pattern appears in numerous other cultures: Tom Tit Tot in England (from English Fairy Tales by Joseph Jacobs ), Whuppity Stoorie in Scotland (from Robert Chambers &apos;s Popular Rhymes of Scotland), Gilitrutt in Iceland, Joaidane جعيدان in Arabic (he who talks too much), Khlamushka Хламушка (junker) in Russia, Rampelnik in Czech Republic, Martinko Klingáč in Slovakia, Ruidoquedito (meaning &quot; little noise &quot; ) in South America, Pancimanci in Hungary (from A Csodafurulya by Kolozsvari Grandpierre Emil), Cvilidreta (whine-screamer) in Croatia, Tremotino in Italy, Ootz-li Gootz-li עוּץ-לי גוּץ-לי in Israel (a compact and rhymy touch to the original sentence and meaning of the story, &quot; He advised me and then turned me into a joke &quot; ), Daiku to Oniroku (daiku means &quot; a carpenter &quot;, to means &quot; and &quot;, and Oniroku is an ogre&apos;s name), or &quot; 大工と鬼六 &quot; in Japan. These tales are Aarne-Thompson type 500, The Name of the Helper. { Heidi Anne Heiner, &quot; Tales Similar to Rumpelstiltskin &quot; } Another of the Grimm fairy tales revolves about a girl trapped by false claims about her spinning abilities: The Three Spinners. However, the three women who assist that girl do not demand her first born, but that she invite them to her wedding and say that they are relatives of hers. With this more reasonable request, she complies, and is freed from her hated spinning when they tell the king that their hideous looks spring from their endless spinning. In one Italian variant, she must discover their names, as with Rumpelstiltskin, but not for the same reason: she must use their names to invite them, and she has forgotten them. [ Name origins ] The name Rumpelstilzchen in German means literally &quot; little rattle stilt &quot;. (A stilt is a post or pole which provides support for a structure.) A rumpelstilt or rumpelstilz was the name of a type of goblin, also called a pophart or poppart that makes noises by rattling posts and rapping on planks. The meaning is similar to rumpelgeist ( &quot; rattle ghost &quot; ) or poltergeist, a mischievous spirit that clatters and moves household objects. (Other related concepts are mummarts or boggart s and hobs that are mischievous household spirits that disguise themselves.) The ending -chen is a German diminutive and designates something as &quot; little &quot; or &quot; dear &quot;, depending on context. The earliest known mention of Rumpelstiltskin occurs in Johann Fischart &apos;s Geschichtklitterung, or Gargantua of 1577 (a loose adaptation of Rabelais&apos; Gargantua and Pantagruel ) which refers to an &quot; amusement &quot; for children named &quot; Rumpele stilt or the Poppart &quot;. [ Names used in translations ] Translations of the original Grimm fairy tale (KHM 55) into various languages have generally substituted different names for the dwarf, whose name is Rumpelstilzchen in the original. For some languages, a name was chosen that comes close in sound to the German name: Rumpelstiltskin in English, Repelsteeltje in Dutch, and Rumpelstichen in Portuguese. He is known as Päronskaft in Swedish [ Bröderna Grimms sagovärld Grimm Jacob Grimm Wilhelm Bonnier Carlsen 2008 91-638-2435-3 Swedish 72 ] (literally &quot; Pear stalk &quot; ); the sense of stilt or stalk of the second part is retained.In Danish and Norwegian, he is known as Rumleskaft (literally &quot; Rumble shank &quot; ). In other languages an entirely different and generally meaningless name was selected, such as Barbichu, Broumpristoche, Grigrigredinmenufretin, Outroupistache, Tracassin or Perlimpinpin in various translations to French. Polish translations use Titelitury, Greek translations use Κουτσοκαλιγέρης, Czech translations use Rumplcimprcampr, Slovak translations use Martinko Klingáč, and Finnish ones Tittelintuure. Italian has Tremotino, Bosnian and Croatian Cvilidreta, and Hebrew [ he עוץ לי גוץ לי ] (Utzli-Gutzli), a name chosen by the poet Avraham Shlonsky when using the fairy tale as the basis of a children&apos;s play, now a classic among Hebrew children&apos;s plays. In Spain, the character&apos;s name is Rumpelstinski. [ Appearance in art and literature ] [ In literature ] In written fiction, Vivian Vande Velde &apos;s book The Rumpelstiltskin Problem presents a handful of alternative versions of the tale in a humorous attempt to address perceived plot hole s in the story. Rumpelstiltskin has also appeared in The Witch&apos;s Boy by Michael Gruber, wherein the character is an unnaturally ugly baby is raised by a witch, who names him Lump when she finds him abandoned in a tree. As a child, he was isolated by the witch to protect him, but when he goes out into the world he becomes consumed by the desire for money and revenge against those who have hurt him. Through a ritual, the witch helps him find his name (i.e., the name of his soul), Rumpelstiltskin, which he is not to tell anyone for it will give them power over him. His childhood innocence is trialed through the cruelty of the world, giving a more in-depth look into his character. And he has also appeared in &quot; The book of lost things &quot; with the nickname &quot; Crooked man &quot;. In Diane Stanley &apos;s short fiction, Rumpelstiltskin&apos;s Daughter, Rumpelstiltskin falls in love with, marries the miller&apos;s daughter and helps her escape from the king. The main character turns out to be their only daughter, Hope. Elizabeth C. Bunce&apos;s novel A Curse Dark as Gold was inspired by the story of Rumpelstiltskin. The miller’s daughter is written as a strong female character determined to save the failing mill and the town that depends on it. It seems likely that the DC Comics&apos; supervillain Mr. Mxyzptlk is inspired by Rumpelstiltskin. They share many characteristics, including a long, consonant heavy name, an impish appearance, and a magical weakness related to their own name. [ In music ] The third movement of Robert Schumann &apos;s Märchenbilder is inspired by the story Schumann&apos;s journals (hard to find and not translated into English). See &quot; Rapunzel in Music &quot; and &quot; Sleeping Beauty in Music &quot; for more corroboration Rumpelstiltskin Grinder is a thrash band from Pennsylvania signed to Relapse Records. Stiltskin is an English rock band, notable for the fact that one of its band members, Ray Wilson, was a temporarily lead vocalist of world-famous progressive rock band Genesis. The band Megaherz released a song named I.M. Rumpelstilzchen on their album Herzwerk II which quotes the original German fairy tale. Rumpofsteelskin is a song by funk band Parliament from the album Motor Booty Affair. The song title is reminiscent of the fairy tale&apos;s title. [ On screen ] [ section May 2012 ] In an episode of the TV show Courage the Cowardly Dog, Muriel is forced by a short Scotsman to stay in a tower and knit sheep wool into kilts. Courage tries to learn the man’s name after learning that the man won’t let anyone who knows his name (which turns out to be Rumpoldkiltskin) work for him. Muriel later suggests that he legally change his name, suggesting &quot; Rumpelstiltskin &quot;, which he thinks is a good idea. The character has also appeared as the antagonist and archenemy in the film Shrek Forever After, voiced by Walt Dohrn, manipulating Shrek into making a wish that would erase Shrek from existence after the ogre indirectly thwarted Rumpelstiltskin&apos;s chance to become the ruler of The Kingdom Of Far Far Away ( &quot; Far, Far Away &quot; ). Rumpelstiltskin already made an earlier appearance in Shrek the Third as a member of the gang of fairy tale villains Prince Charming rounds up in an attempt to take over Far, Far Away, Though he had a very different look and was played by a different actor. A 1987 live-action musical film, a fairly direct retelling of the fairy tale, starring Amy Irving as the miller&apos;s daughter and Billy Barty as the title character. A 1996 Supernatural B-Horror movie where Rumpelstiltskin is trapped as a rock of Jade for 500 years until a woman is compelled to purchase it from an unusual antique shop. The woman makes a wish that her dead husband could come back to life to see their child. Rumpelstiltskin grants her wish, bringing her husband back for one night. Then tries to steal her baby from her mother with an attempt to eat the baby&apos;s soul. This movie stars Max Grodenchik (as Rumpelstiltskin), and Kim Johnston Ulrich (as the mother of the child). Rumpelstiltskin is a main character in the TV series Once Upon a Time from ABC, where he is the pawn-shop owner Mr. Gold in the town of Storybrooke, Maine, where fairy tale characters are trapped with no memory of their true selves. He is played by Robert Carlyle. Flashbacks to the fairy tale realm that the characters came from regularly reveal that Rumpelstiltskin plays a role in the backstories of nearly every major fairy tale character, serving as a Faust ian figure who enacts costly deals with the characters that they think are to their advantage. Examples of his actions include playing the role of Cinderella &apos;s fairy godmother after killing the real one, arranging for the secret adoption of Prince Charming &apos;s twin brother by the king, and giving the evil queen the curse that sends everyone to the real world. The series&apos; pilot episode reveals that he is considered to be one of the most dangerous beings in the realm. A later episode shows that he was once a coward who ran from battle, but gained his powers by capturing the dagger of an entity called the Dark One and then killing him. In the twelfth episode it is revealed Mr. Gold knows he was once Rumpelstilskin, and that he was in love with Belle of Beauty and the Beast. Also Rumpelstiltskin has a feud with the Queen herself, who seeks to have more power than Rumpelstiltskin. In the series The 10th Kingdom, protagonists Tony Lewis and Wolf encounter a blind woodsman who will only give them his magic axe, capable of cutting through anything, if they can guess his name, but will cut Wolf&apos;s head off if Tony doesn&apos;t guess it in time. Although Tony assumes that the man&apos;s name is Rumpelstiltskin due to the similarities between the situations, he is eventually revealed to actually be named Juliet. In an episode of the TV show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine titled &quot; If Wishes Were Horses &quot;, Miles O&apos;Brien reads his daughter the story of Rumpelstiltskin at bedtime and then leaves her room. She comes out shortly later to inform her father that Rumpelstiltskin is in the room with her. O&apos;Brien assumes that it is just her imagination and goes in to the room with her only to discover that Rumpelstiltskin is in fact in her room. At the end of the episode it is revealed that Rumpelstiltskin (along with various other manifestations) were in fact aliens that were studying imagination. In the TV show Shelley Duvall&apos;s Faerie Tale Theatre, the second episode aired on 1982 titled &quot; Rumpelstiltskin &quot;. Hervé Villechaize plays Rumpelstiltskin, Ned Beatty is the king and Shelley Duvall as the miller&apos;s daughter. In the German TV-series &quot; Spuk unterm Riesenrad &quot; Rumpelstiltskin is the only one of the three evil, living dummies (witch, giant and Rumpelstiltskin) who doesn&apos;t turns good at the end and is frozen by a policeman with a fire extinguisher. He also tries to take over Burg Falkenstein, in blackmailing the owner with a fire.
