He is incorrectly credited with the discovery of the existence of galaxies other than the Milky Way and galactic red shift - discoveries made by the astronomer Vesto Slipher in 1912. He popularized Vesto Slipher &apos;s discovery that the loss in frequency—the redshift —observed in the spectra of light from other galaxies increased in proportion to a particular galaxy&apos;s distance from Earth. This relationship which was based Slipher&apos;s data became known as Hubble&apos;s law. Vesto Slipher, the unsung hero of twentieth-century astronomy was the first to present his findings in a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in August 1914. Stephen Hawking wryly notes in his book the Universe in a Nutshell &quot; Hubble heard the presentation &quot;. Due to Vesto Slipher &apos;s reserved and reticent personality, his discoveries are incorrectly credited to Hubble. Hubble doubted the Doppler shift interpretation of the observed redshift that had been proposed earlier by Vesto Slipher, whose data he used, and that led to the theory of the metric expansion of space. { Effects of Red Shifts on the Distribution of Nebulae, Hubble, Edwin, Astrophysical Journal, vol. 84, p.517, The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System } { Red-shifts and the distribution of nebul &amp; aelig, Hubble, Edwin, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 97, p.513, The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System } He tended to believe the frequency of any beam of light could, by some so far unknown means, be diminished ever stronger, the longer the beam travels through space. { Engelbert Broda : } [ Die Kräfte des Weltalls The forces of the universe Die Buchgemeinde authorized 1954 1954 Globus Zeitungs- Druck- und Verlagsanstalt, Gesellschaft m. b.

Da die Energie eines Lichtstrahls um so kleiner ist, je röter das Licht ist, so würde das gleichzeitig bedeuten, dass das Licht im Lauf von Jahrmillionen Energie verliert. (Die Energie müsste dann freilich in anderer Form wieder auftauchen.) Das Licht, das von den fernsten Nebeln stammt, hätte die meiste Energie verloren, und die Rotverschiebung wäre begründet. Zu dieser Anschauung neigt jener Astronom, der sich um die Messung der Rotverschiebung die größten Verdienste erworben hat  — Edwin Hubble. &quot; English: &quot; It could also be that, according to a  — so far not yet discovered  — law of physics, every beam of light over long periods of time, i.e. when it hurries through long stretches, decreases in frequency and therefore, little by little, becomes redder. As the energy of a beam of light is the smaller the redder the light is, this would, at the same time, mean that light, over the course of millions of years, loses energy. (The energy would then, of course, have to reappear in an other form.) The light from the farthest galaxies would have lost the most energy so that the redshift would be explained. The astronomer who has contributed to the measurement of the redshift more than any other scientist  — Edwin Hubble  — tends to this view. ] [ Biography ] Hubble was born to an insurance executive, John Powell Hubble, and Virginia Lee James in Marshfield, Missouri and moved to Wheaton, Illinois in  1900.

He won seven first places and a third place in a single high school track and field meet in 1906. That year he also set the state high school record for the high jump in Illinois. Another of his personal interests was dry-fly fishing, and he practiced amateur boxing as well. { World of Physics and The Cloudy Night Book } His studies at the University of Chicago were concentrated on mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy, which led to a bachelor of science degree in  1910. Hubble also became a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity (and in 1948 was named the Kappa Sigma &quot; Man of the Year &quot; ). He spent the three years at The Queen&apos;s College, Oxford after earning his bachelors as one of the university&apos;s first Rhodes Scholars, initially studying jurisprudence (instead of science as a promise to his dying father) [ Astronomer Edwin Hubble Michael D.

Hubble&apos;s father had in 1909 moved his family from Chicago to Shelbyville, Kentucky so that the family could live in a small town, ultimately settling in nearby Louisville. His father died in the winter of  1913, while Edwin was still in England, and in the summer of  1913, he returned to care for his mother, two sisters, and younger brother, as did his brother William. The family moved once more to Everett Avenue, in Louisville&apos;s Highlands neighborhood, to accommodate Edwin and William. [ http://www.astro.louisville.edu/education/hubble_in_louisville/index.html Edwin Hubble, Family, and Friends in Louisville 1909–1916 John F. Kielkopf ] Upon returning to the United States, Hubble taught Spanish, physics, and mathematics at the New Albany High School in New Albany, Indiana. He also coached the boys&apos; basketball team there. Hubble&apos;s early biographers uniformly noted that he had passed the Kentucky bar examination and briefly practiced law in Louisville, but he did neither. There is no evidence that Hubble ever handled a legal case.

His dissertation was titled Photographic Investigations of Faint Nebulae. Hubble then served in the United States Army in World War  I, and he quickly advanced to the rank of major. In 1919, Hubble was offered a staff position in California by George Ellery Hale, the founder and director of the Carnegie Institution&apos;s Mount Wilson Observatory, near Pasadena, California, where he remained on the staff until his death. Hubble also served in the U.S. Army at the Aberdeen Proving Ground during World War  II. For his work there he received the Legion of Merit award. Shortly before his death, Mount Palomar&apos;s giant [ 200 in m on ] reflector Hale Telescope was completed, and Hubble was the first astronomer to use it. Hubble continued his research at the Mount Wilson and Mount Palomar Observatories, where he remained active until his death. Hubble experienced a heart attack in July 1949 while on vacation in Colorado. He was taken care of by Grace Hubble and continued on a modified diet and work schedule. He died of cerebral thrombosis (a spontaneous blood clot in his brain) on September  28, 1953, in San Marino, California. No funeral was held for him, and his wife, Grace Hubble, did not reveal the disposition of his body.

At that time, the prevailing view of the cosmos was that the universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope at Mt. Wilson, Hubble identified Cepheid variable s (a kind of star; see also standard candle ) in several spiral nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum. His observations, made in 1922–1923, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own. This idea had been opposed by many in the astronomy establishment of the time, in particular by the Harvard University -based Harlow Shapley. Despite the opposition, Hubble, then a thirty-five year old scientist, had his findings first published in The New York Times on [ November 23 ], 1924, [ Sharov Aleksandr Sergeevich Novikov Igor Dmitrievich Edwin Hubble, the discoverer of the big bang universe http://books.google.com/books?id%3DttEwkEdPc70C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA34 December 31, 2011 1993 Cambridge University Press 978-0-521-41617-7 34 ] and then more formally presented in the form of a paper at the January  1, 1925 meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

Hubble also devised the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the Hubble sequence. [ Toward a new millennium in galaxy morphology David L.

Humason &apos;s measurements of the redshifts associated with the galaxies, he discovered a rough proportionality of the objects&apos; distances with their red shifts. {, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science vol 15 } Though there was considerable scatter (now known to be due to peculiar velocities), he was able to plot a trend line from the 46 galaxies and obtained a value for the Hubble Constant of 500  km/s/Mpc, which is much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in their distance calibrations. In 1929 Hubble formulated the empirical Redshift Distance Law of galaxies, nowadays termed simply Hubble&apos;s law, which, if the redshift is interpreted as a measure of recession speed, is consistent with the solutions of Einstein ’s equations of general relativity for a homogeneous, isotropic expanding space. Although concepts underlying an expanding universe were well understood earlier, this statement by Hubble and Humason led to wider scale acceptance for this view. The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. But two years before, in  1927, Georges Lemaître, a Belgian Catholic priest and physicist, published a paper in an obscure Belgian journal, Annales de la Societe Scientifique de Bruxelles. In that paper, he showed that the data collected by Hubble and two other astronomers up to that time was enough to derive a linear velocity-distance relation between the galaxies, and that this supported a model of an expanding universe based on Einstein’s equations for General Relativity. This discovery was the first observational support for the Big Bang theory which had been proposed by Georges Lemaître in  1927. The observed velocities of distant galaxies, taken together with the cosmological principle appeared to show that the Universe was expanding in a manner consistent with the Friedmann-Lemaître model of general relativity. In 1931 Hubble wrote a letter to the Dutch cosmologist Willem de Sitter expressing his opinion on the theoretical interpretation of the redshift-distance relation: [ Hubble’s diagram and cosmic expansion Robert P. Kirshner PNAS January 6, 2004 February 12, 2012 http://www.pnas.org/content/101/1/8.full.pdf%2Bhtml ] [ Mr. Humason and I are both deeply sensible of your gracious appreciation of the papers on velocities and distances of nebulae. We use the term ‘apparent’ velocities to emphasize the empirical features of the correlation. The interpretation, we feel, should be left to you and the very few others who are competent to discuss the matter with authority. ] Today, the &quot; apparent velocities &quot; in question are understood as an increase in proper distance that occurs due to the expansion of space. Light traveling through stretching space will experience a Hubble-type redshift, a mechanism different from the Doppler effect (although the two mechanisms become equivalent descriptions related by a coordinate transformation for nearby galaxies). In the 1930s Hubble was involved in determining the distribution of galaxies and spatial curvature. These data seemed to indicate that the universe was flat and homogeneous, but there was a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. According to Allan Sandage, [ Hubble believed that his count data gave a more reasonable result concerning spatial curvature if the redshift correction was made assuming no recession. To the very end of his writings he maintained this position, favouring (or at the very least keeping open) the model where no true expansion exists, and therefore that the redshift &quot; represents a hitherto unrecognized principle of nature. &quot; Sandage, Allan (1989), &quot; Edwin Hubble 1889–1953 &quot;, The Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Vol. 83, No.6. Retrieved March 26, 2010. ] There were methodological problems with Hubble&apos;s survey technique that showed a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. In particular the technique did not account for changes in luminosity of galaxies due to galaxy evolution. Earlier, in  1917, Albert Einstein had found that his newly developed theory of general relativity indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. Unable to believe what his own equations were telling him, Einstein introduced a cosmological constant (a   &quot; fudge factor &quot; ) to the equations to avoid this &quot; problem &quot;. When Einstein heard of Hubble&apos;s discovery, he said that changing his equations was &quot; the biggest blunder of [his] life. &quot; [ Cosmological Constant Public Broadcasting Station (PBS) PBS.org May 29, 2011 http://www.pbs.org/wnet/hawking/strange/html/strange_cosmo.html ] [ Other discoveries ] Hubble discovered the asteroid 1373 Cincinnati on August 30, 1935. He also wrote The Observational Approach to Cosmology and The Realm of the Nebulae approximately during this time.

He did this largely so that astronomers—including himself—could be recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee for their valuable contributions to astrophysics. This campaign was unsuccessful in Hubble&apos;s lifetime, but shortly after his death the Nobel Prize Committee decided that astronomical work would be eligible for the physics prize.
