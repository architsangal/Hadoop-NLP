For Eurostat purposes it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG21) and is one of four unitary authority areas that comprise the &quot; Shropshire and Staffordshire &quot; NUTS 2 region. The district was created in 1974 as The Wrekin, then a non-metropolitan district of Shropshire. Before the creation of The Wrekin, Telford was a new town run by the Telford Development Corporation (TDC) from the 1960s to the changes in 1974. In 1998 the district became a unitary authority and was renamed Telford and Wrekin. All of the council houses previously owned by Wrekin District Council and the subsequent Telford and Wrekin Council were transferred to a newly created Housing Association, the Wrekin Housing Trust, in 1999 which now owns the majority of social housing in Telford. { http://www.wrekinhousingtrust.org.uk/thetrust/history.aspx } The borough&apos;s major settlement is Telford, a new town designated in the 1960s incorporating the existing towns of Dawley, Madeley, Oakengates and Wellington. The next largest population centre is Newport, a market town to the north of Telford. On 1 April 1998, as a result of the Local Government Commission for England &apos;s review, the district became a unitary authority, independent from Shropshire County Council. The headquarters of the council are in Telford Town Centre. It remains part of the Shropshire ceremonial county and shares institutions such as the Fire and Rescue Service with the rest of Shropshire. Telford and Wrekin comes under the West Mercia Police, based in Worcester (outside Shropshire). The borough borders Staffordshire, but is mostly surrounded by the non-metropolitan county of Shropshire, whose unitary authority is Shropshire Council. The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, and covered Dawley, Newport, Oakengates and Wellington urban district s, Wellington Rural District and part of Shifnal parish in the Shifnal Rural District. Telford and Wrekin applied unsuccessfully for City status in 2000, but the district was granted borough status in 2002.
