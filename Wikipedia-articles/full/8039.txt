Danish foreign policy is based on its identity as a sovereign nation in Europe. As such its primary foreign policy focus is on its relations with other nations as a sovereign independent nation. Denmark has long had good relations with other nations.It has been involved in coordinating Western assistance to the Baltic states ( Estonia, [ http://www.ambtallinn.um.dk/en/menu/TheEmbassy/DanishEstonianDefenceCooperation/DanishEstonianDefenceCooperation.htm Danish - Estonian Defence Cooperation Danish embassy in Tallinn, Estonia 22 February 2011 ] Latvia, and Lithuania ).

Instead of the traditional adaptative foreign policy of the small country, Denmark is today pursuing an active foreign policy, where human rights, democracy and other crucial values is to be defended actively. In recent years, Greenland and The Faroe Islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues, such as fishing, whaling and geopolitical concerns. Following World War II, Denmark ended its two-hundred year long policy of neutrality. Denmark has been a member of NATO since its founding in 1949, and membership in NATO remains highly popular. There were several serious confrontations between the U.S. and Denmark on security policy in the so-called &quot; footnote era &quot; (1982–88), when an alternative parliamentary majority forced the government to adopt specific national positions on nuclear and arms control issues. The alternative majority in these issues was because the Social liberal Party ( Radikale Venstre ) supported the governing majority in economic policy issues, but was against certain NATO policies and voted with the left in these issues. The conservative led Centre-right government accepted this variety of &quot; minority parliamentarism &quot;, that is, without making it a question of the government&apos;s parliamentary survival. With the end of the Cold War, however, Denmark has been supportive of U.S. policy objectives in the Alliance. Denmark is not a member of the Western European Union but does hold observer status. [ http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3167.htm US Department of State: Denmark Government of the United States 22 February 2011 ] Danes have enjoyed a reputation as &quot; reluctant &quot; Europeans.

The Amsterdam Treaty was approved in the referendum of May 28, 1998. In the autumn of 2000, Danish citizens rejected membership of the Euro currency group in a referendum. The Lisbon treaty was ratified by the Danish parliament alone. [ Denmark and the Treaty of Lisbon http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/euo_en/dkeu/lissabon/ Folketinget 20 October 2011 ] It was not considered a surrendering of national sovereignty, which would have implied the holding of a referendum according to article 20 of the constitution. [ No Danish vote on Lisbon Treaty http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7138138.stm BBC BBC News 20 October 2011 11 December 2007 ] Currently, the Danish government wants a referendum on the opt-outs from the EU-treaty, but the prospect of the opt-outs perhaps being rejected does not look appealing.
