It is the administrative centre of the Braničevo District of Serbia. In 2011, the city had a population of 42,963 and its municipal area 74,070. [ Name ] In Serbian, the city is known as Požarevac (Пожаревац), in Romanian as Pojarevaţ, in Turkish as Pasarofça, in German as Passarowitz, and in Hungarian as Pozsarevác. The name means &quot; fire -town &quot; in Serbian (Here &quot; fire &quot; is in the sense of a disaster). [ History ] [ Ancient times ] In ancient times, the area was inhabited by Thracians, Dacians, and Celts. [ March 2012 ] There was a city at this locality known as Margus in Latin after the Roman conquest in the first century BC. [ March 2012 ] In 435, the city of Margus, under the Eastern Roman Empire, was the site of a treaty between the Byzantine Empire and the Hun leaders Attila and Bleda. [ March 2012 ] One pretext for the Hun invasion of the Eastern Roman Empire in 442 was that the Bishop of Margus had crossed the Danube to ransack and desecrate the royal Hun graves on the north bank of the Danube. When the Romans discussed handing over the Bishop, he slipped away and betrayed the city to the Huns, who then sacked the city and went on to invade as far as the gates of Constantinople itself. [ March 2012 ] After the fall of the Hunnic Empire, the area was again controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire. In the 6th century, it was briefly controlled by the Kingdom of the Gepids. Since the 6th century, the area was populated by Slavs, but the Eastern Roman Empire held a nominal control over the region until the 8th century when Balkan Slavs achieved de facto independence from the Eastern Empire. The area was subsequently included into the Bulgarian Empire and was alternately ruled by the Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary until the 13th century. In the 13th century, the area was ruled by independent local Slavic-Bulgarian rulers, Drman and Kudelin. It was subsequently included into the Kingdom of Syrmia, ruled by Serbian king Stefan Dragutin and into the Kingdom of Serbia and Serbian Empire ruled by Stefan Dušan. [ Archaeology ] A Bronze Age figurine &quot; The Idol of Kličevac &quot; was found in a grave in the village of Kličevac. It was destroyed during World War I. { http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/dgarasanin-the_bronze.htm } The National Museum in Belgrade and Požarevac has some 40,000 items found in Viminacium, of which over 700 are of gold and silver.

During Ottoman administration, it was part of the Sanjak of Smederevo. In 1718, Požarevac was the site of the signing of the Treaty of Požarevac. After this treaty, the town came under Habsburg control and was part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Serbia (from 1718 to 1739). Since 1739, the town was again under Ottoman control. During the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813), the town was part of the Karađorđe&apos;s Serbia. After the end of the uprising in 1813, the town briefly came again under direct Ottoman control, but, following the Second Serbian Uprising from 1815, the town became part of the autonomous Ottoman Principality of Serbia. Požarevac was the second capital of Serbian prince Miloš Obrenović and the first regular state court in Serbia was established in this town in 1821. Since 1878, Požarevac was part of the independent Principality of Serbia and since 1882 part of the Kingdom of Serbia. Since 1918, the town was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929), while during Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, from 1941 to 1944, it was part of the German-occupied puppet state of Serbia.
