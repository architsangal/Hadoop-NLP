Its has roughly 70% share of the global market whose estimated valued at US$2.5 billion. Its global headquarters are in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. In late 2011 the company fired its newly appointed British president, precipitating a scandal that wiped 75% off the company&apos;s stock market valuation. The scandal culminated in admission by the company that some of its board members had engaged in one of the biggest and most durable loss-concealing scams in the history of corporate Japan. [ Products ] [ Cameras &amp; amp; audio ] In 1936, Olympus introduced its first camera, the Semi-Olympus I. The first innovative camera series from Olympus was the Pen, launched in 1959. Half-frame format, allowing 72 pictures of 18 × 24mm format on a standard 36 exposure roll of film, made Pen cameras compact and portable for their time. Olympus OM Lenses The Pen system design team, led by Yoshihisa Maitani, later created the OM system, a full-frame professional 35mm SLR system designed to compete with Nikon and Canon&apos;s bestsellers. The OM system introduced a new trend towards more compact cameras and lenses, being much smaller than its competitors and presenting innovative design features such as off-the-film (OTF) metering and OTF flash automation. Eventually the system included 14 different bodies, approximately 60 Zuiko-branded lenses, and numerous camera accessories.

In 1983, Olympus, along with Canon, branded a range of video recording equipment manufactured by JVC [ February 2007 ], and called it &quot; Olympus Video Photography &quot;, even employing renowned photographer Terance Donovan to promote the range [ February 2007 ]. A second version of the system was available the year after, but this was Olympus&apos; last foray into the world of consumer video equipment until digital cameras became popular [ February 2007 ]. Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, who was later to become President of Olympus, foresaw the demand for the digital SLR, and is credited with the company&apos;s strategy in digital photography. He fought for commitment by Olympus to enter the market in high-resolution photographic products. As a result of his efforts, Olympus released an 810,000-pixel digital camera for the mass market in 1996, when the resolution of rivals&apos; offerings were less than half. { &quot; Dismissed CEO Turns Focus on Troubles at Olympus &quot;, Nikkei Business. 31 Oct. 2011.

Woodford, an Olympus veteran of 30-years, was previously Executive Managing Director of Olympus Medical Systems Europa. Olympus appointed Woodford its CEO six months later, but the board suddenly removed him as chief executive two weeks into the job, whilst allowing him to retain his board seat. { Bacani, Cesar (24 October 2011) &quot; The Olympus Scandal: When a Foreign CEO Rebels &quot; (pg 1).

Retrieved 24 October 2011 } Woodford alleged that his removal was linked to several prior acquisitions he questioned, particularly the US$2.2 billion deal in 2008 to acquire British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group. Thomson Reuters reported that US$687 million was paid to a middle-man as a success fee – a sum equal to 31% of the purchase price, and which ranks as the highest ever M &amp; A fee. According to the Daily Telegraph, some of the sums paid out relating to the acquisition of a technology company ITX were also under examination. Woodford noted that an article in Japanese financial magazine Facta in July prompted his suspicion of the transactions. Reports also said the company acquired three other Japanese companies outside its core business, and recognised that the assets were worth US$721 million less than their acquisition value 12 months previously. Shareholders expressed concern after Olympus&apos; share price nearly halved in value following the Woodford revelations, and asked for &quot; prompt action &quot;.
