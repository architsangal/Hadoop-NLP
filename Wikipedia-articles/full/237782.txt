[ #35AC35 Breeding range 1px solid #aaa ] [ #5087C3 Winter range 1px solid #aaa ] [ red solid 2px Migration routes ] The White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. Its plumage is mainly white, with black on its wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average [ 100 – 115 cm in on ] from beak tip to end of tail, with a [ 155 – 215 cm in on ] wingspan. The two subspecies, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to Finland ), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan ), and southern Africa. The White Stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends do not form over water. A carnivore, the White Stork eats a wide range of animal prey, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, and small birds. It takes most of its food from the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. It is a monogamous breeder, but does not pair for life. Both members of the pair build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years. Each year the female can lay one clutch of usually four eggs, which hatch asynchronously 33–34  days after being laid. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and both feed the young. The young leave the nest 58–64  days after hatching, and continue to be fed by the parents for a further 7–20  days. The White Stork has been rated as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It benefited from human activities during the Middle Ages as woodland was cleared, but changes in farming methods and industrialisation saw it decline and disappear from parts of Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Conservation and reintroduction programs across Europe have resulted in the White Stork resuming breeding in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden. It has few natural predators, but may harbour several types of parasite; the plumage is home to chewing lice and feather mites, while the large nests maintain a diverse range of mesostigmatic mites. This conspicuous bird has given rise to many legends across its range, of which the best-known is the story of babies being brought by storks. [ Taxonomy and evolution ] The White Stork was one of the many bird species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, [ Linnaeus Carl Carolus Linnaeus Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

It was reclassified to (and was designated the type species of) the new genus Ciconia by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.

[ Simpson D.P. Cassell&apos;s Latin Dictionary Cassell Ltd. 1979 5 London 103 0-304-52257-0 ] The word stork is derived from the Old English word storc, and appeared in the tenth-century works the Erfurt Glossary, where the word is equated with Ciconia, and Aelfric&apos;s Homilies. The word is related to the Old High German storah, &quot; stork &quot;, and similar words in many other European languages, all of which are descended from the Teutonic sturko-z.

C. c. asiatica, described by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov in 1873, breeds in Turkestan and winters from Iran to India. It is slightly larger than the nominate subspecies. The stork family contains six genera in three broad groups: the open-billed and wood storks ( Mycteria and Anastomus ), the giant storks ( Ephippiorhynchus, Jabiru and Leptoptilos ), and the &quot; typical &quot; storks, Ciconia. The typical storks include the White Stork and six other extant species, { Elliott 1992, p. 437. } which are characterised by straight pointed beaks and mainly black and white plumage. [ Kahl M. Philip 1987 An Overview of the Storks of the World Colonial Waterbirds 10 2 131–34 10.2307/1521251 ] Its closest relatives are the larger, black-billed Oriental White Stork (Ciconia boyciana) of East Asia, which was formerly classified as a subspecies of the White Stork, and the Maguari Stork (C.  maguari) of South America. Close evolutionary relationships within Ciconia are suggested by behavioural similarities and, biochemically, through analysis of both mitochondrial cytochrome &apos;&apos;b&apos;&apos; gene sequences and DNA-DNA hybridization.

(2007)The Atlas of Bird Migrations: Tracing the Great Journeys of the Worlds Birds } Like all storks, it has long legs, a long neck, and a long, straight, pointed beak. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. The plumage is mainly white with black flight feather s and wing coverts; the black is caused by the pigment melanin. [ Grande Juan Manuel Negro, Juan José; María Torres, José 2004 The evolution of bird plumage colouration; a role for feather-degrading bacteria?

The adult has a bright red beak and red legs, the coloration of which is derived from carotenoid s in the diet. In parts of Spain, studies have shown that the pigment is based on astaxanthin obtained from an introduced species of crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) and the bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings, in contrast to the duller beaks of young White Storks elsewhere.

It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail. It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched. In contrast, it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting. Moulting has not been extensively studied, but appears to take place throughout the year, with the primary flight feathers replaced over the breeding season. { Vogelpark Avifauna, Netherlands. Beaks turn red starting at the base. } Upon hatching, the young White Stork is partly covered with short, sparse, whitish down feather s. This early down is replaced about a week later with a denser coat of woolly white down. By three weeks, the young bird acquires black scapulars and flight feather s. On hatching the chick has pinkish legs, which turn to greyish-black as it ages. Its beak is black with a brownish tip. By the time it fledge s, the juvenile bird&apos;s plumage is similar to that of the adult, though its black feathers are often tinged with brown, and its beak and legs are a duller brownish-red or orange. The beak is typically orange or red with a darker tip. { Cramp 1977, p. 328. } The bills gain the adults&apos; red colour the following summer, although the black tips persist in some individuals. Young storks adopt adult plumage by their second summer. { Van den Bossche 2002, p. 11. } [ Similar species ] Within its range the White Stork is distinctive when seen on the ground but, when seen at a distance in flight, it can be confused with several other species with similar underwing patterns, such as the Yellow-billed Stork, Great White Pelican, and Egyptian Vulture. The Yellow-billed Stork is identified by its black tail and a longer, slightly curved, yellow beak. The White Stork also tends to be larger than the Yellow-billed Stork. The Great White Pelican has short legs which do not extend beyond its tail, and it flies with its neck retracted, keeping its head near to its stocky body, giving it a different flight profile. { Cramp 1977, p. 228. } Pelicans also behave differently, soaring in orderly, synchronised flocks rather than in disorganised groups of individuals as the White Stork does. { Svensson and Grant 1999, p. 26. } The Egyptian Vulture is much smaller, with a long wedge-shaped tail, shorter legs and a small yellow-tinged head on a short neck. { Svensson and Grant 1999, p. 74. } The Common Crane, which can also look black and white in strong light, shows longer legs and a longer neck in flight. { Svensson and Grant 1999, p. 34. } [ Distribution and habitat ] alt=Several black and white birds with long red legs and long red beaks walk in a green grassy area.

Although not many storks passed through Rossitten itself, the observatory coordinated the large-scale ringing of the species throughout Germany and elsewhere in Europe.

There, they spend the winter in savanna from Kenya and Uganda south to the Cape Province of South Africa. { Cramp 1977, p. 331. } In these areas they congregate in large flocks which may exceed a thousand individuals. Some diverge westwards into western Sudan and Chad, and may reach Nigeria. In spring, the birds return north; they are recorded from Sudan and Egypt from February to April.

Tailwind s and scarcity of food and water en route (birds fly faster over regions lacking resources) increase average speed. To avoid a long sea crossing over the Mediterranean, birds from central Europe either follow an eastern migration route by crossing the Bosphorus to Turkey, traversing the Levant, then bypassing the Sahara Desert by following the Nile valley southwards, or follow a western route over the Strait of Gibraltar.

The flocks of migrating raptor s, White Storks and Great White Pelican s can stretch for 200  km (125  mi). { Newton 2010, pp. 74–75. } The eastern route is twice as long as the western, but storks take the same time to reach the wintering grounds by either. { Newton 2010, p. 144. } Juvenile White Storks set off on their first southward migration in an inherited direction but, if displaced from that bearing by weather conditions, they are unable to compensate, and may end up in a new wintering location. Adults can compensate for strong winds and adjust their direction to finish at their normal winter sites, because they are familiar with the location. For the same reason, all spring migrants, even those from displaced wintering locations, can find their way back to the traditional breeding sites. { Newton 2010, p. 229. } An experiment with young birds raised in captivity in Kaliningrad and released in the absence of wild storks to show them the way revealed that they appeared to have an instinct to fly south, although the scatter in direction was large.

For many, the shortest route would take them over the Mediterranean Sea; however, since air thermals do not form over water, they generally detour over land to avoid the trans-Mediterranean flights that would require prolonged energetic wing flapping.

Long flights over water may occasionally be undertaken. A young White Stork ringed at the nest in Denmark subsequently appeared in England, where it spent some days before moving on.

The bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a knocking sound is made each time its beak closes. The clattering is amplified by its throat pouch, which acts as a resonator. Used in a variety of social interactions, bill-clattering generally grows louder the longer it lasts, and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on the situation—for example, slower during copulation and briefer when given as an alarm call. The only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss; however, young birds can generate a harsh hiss, various cheeping sounds, and a cat-like mew they use to beg for food. Like the adults, young also clatter their beaks. { Cramp 1977, p. 334. } The up-down display is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. Here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, post coitus, and also as a threat display. Breeding pairs are territorial over the summer, and use this display, as well as crouching forward with the tails cocked and wings extended. { Cramp 1977, p. 333. } [ Feeding ] White Storks consume a wide variety of animal prey. They prefer to forage in meadows that are within roughly 5  km (3  mi) of their nest and sites where the vegetation is shorter so that their prey is more accessible. Their diet varies according to season, locality and prey availability. Common food items include insects (primarily beetles, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets), earthworms, reptiles, amphibians, particularly frog species such as the edible frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus) and common frog (Rana temporaria) and small mammals such as voles, moles, and shrews. Less commonly, they also eat bird eggs and young birds, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and scorpions. They hunt mainly during the day, swallowing small prey whole, but killing and breaking apart larger prey before swallowing. Rubber bands are mistaken for earthworms and consumed, occasionally resulting in fatal blockage of the digestive tract. [ 10.1675/063.034.0414 ] Birds returning to Latvia during spring have been shown to locate their prey, moor frogs ( Rana arvalis ), by homing in on the mating calls produced by aggregations of male frogs.

Nests are built in loose colonies. Not persecuted as it is viewed as a good omen, it often nests close to human habitation; in southern Europe, nests can be seen on churches and other buildings. The nest is typically used year after year especially by older males. The males arrive earlier in the season and choose the nests.

Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid. High-frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra-pair copulation; however, extra-pair copulation is infrequent in White Storks. [ Frequent Copulations Despite Low Sperm Competition in White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) Tortosa, Francisco S.; Redondo, Tomas Behaviour 121 3 &amp; 4 1992 288–315 4535031 10.1163/156853992X00408 ] A White Stork pair raises a single brood a year. The female typically lays four eggs, though clutches of 1–7 have been recorded. The eggs are white, but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutin ous covering. They measure [ 72.58 x 51.86 mm in on ], and weigh [ 96 – 129 g oz on ], of which [ 10.76 g oz on ] is shell.

The first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over the others. While stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings, as is the case in some species, weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents.

Tortosa Redondo, Tomas Ornis Scandinavica 23 2 1992 185–89 3676447 ] This behaviour occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. White Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents&apos; method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. Despite this, this behaviour has not commonly been observed. { Basilica of St. John, } { Selçuk, Izmir Province, Turkey } The temperature and weather around the time of hatching in spring is important; cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates. Somewhat unexpectedly, studies have found that later-hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier-hatching nestmates.

[ Parasites and diseases ] White Stork nests are habitat s for an array of small arthropods, particularly over the warmer months after the birds arrive to breed. Nesting over successive years, the storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them. Not only do their bodies tend to regulate temperatures within the nest, but excrement, food remains and feather and skin fragments provide nourishment for a large and diverse population of free-living mesostigmatic mites. A survey of twelve nests found 13,352 individuals of 34 species, the most common being Macrocheles merdarius, M.  robustulus, Uroobovella pyriformis and Trichouropoda orbicularis, which together represented almost 85% of all the specimens collected. These feed on the eggs and larvae of insects and on nematode s, which are abundant in the nest litter. These mites are dispersed by coprophilous beetles, often of the family Scarabaeidae, or on dung brought by the storks during nest construction. Parasitic mites do not occur, perhaps being controlled by the predatory species. The overall impact of the mite population is unclear, the mites may have a role in suppressing harmful organisms (and hence be beneficial), or they may themselves have an adverse effect on nestlings.

The bird is featured in two of Aesop&apos;s Fables : The Fox and the Stork and The Farmer and the Stork. [ Fables Aesop c. 620–564 BCE 1-56156-088-X ] They were also thought to care for their aged parents, feeding them and even transporting them, and children&apos;s books depicted them as a model of filial values. A Greek law called Pelargonia, from the Ancient Greek word pelargos for stork, required citizens to take care of their aged parents. The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death. [ The White Stork Ciconia ciconiaprotection in Poland by tradition, customs, law, and active efforts Dolata, Pawel T.

Some of the earliest understanding on bird migration were initiated by an interest in White Storks; Pfeilstorch ( &quot; arrow storks &quot; ) were found in Europe with African arrow s embedded in their bodies. A well-known example of such a stork found in the summer of 1822 in the German town of Klütz in Mecklenburg was made into a mounted taxidermy specimen, complete with the ornate African arrow, that is now in the University of Rostock.

[ Sax Boria The Mythical Zoo 2001 Oxford, UK ABC-CLIO 1-57607-612-1 153–54 ] German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks. These caves contained adebarsteine or &quot; stork stones &quot;. The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney. Households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for the stork on the window sill. From there the folklore has spread around the world to countries such as the Philippines and South America. In Slavic mythology and religion, storks were thought to carry unborn soul s from Iriy to Earth in spring and summer. [ Gieysztor, Aleksander 1982 Polish Mitologia Słowian Wydawnictwa Artystyczne i Filmowe Warsaw, Poland 83-221-0152-X ] This belief still persists in the modern folk culture of many Slavic countries, in the simplified child story that &quot; storks bring children into the world &quot;.

Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as Juno to the Holy Ghost, and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage (depicting purity), size (in that it is big enough to carry an infant), and flight at high altitude (likened to flying between Earth and Heaven). The fable and its relation to the internal world of the child have been discussed by Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung. [ Jung Carl 1910 The Association Method – Lecture III: Experiences Concerning the Psychic Life of the Child American Journal of Psychology 31 219–69 1422691 http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/Association/lecture3.htm 2 March 2011 3 ] In fact, Jung recalled being told the story himself upon the birth of his own sister. [ Pickles Penny 2011 Jung the Man The Society of Analytical Psychology The Society of Analytical Psychology: Jungian Analysis and Psychotherapy London http://www.thesap.org.uk/jung-the-man 2 March 2011 ] The traditional link with the newborn continues with their use in advertising for such products as nappies and birth announcements. There were negative aspects to stork folklore as well; a Polish folk tale relates how God made the stork&apos;s plumage white, while the Devil gave it black wings, imbuing it with both good and evil impulses. They were also associated with handicapped or stillborn babies in Germany, explained as the stork having dropped the baby en route to the household, or as revenge or punishment for past wrongdoing. A mother who was confined to bed around the time of childbirth was said to have been &quot; bitten &quot; by the stork. In Denmark, storks were said to toss a nestling off the nest and then an egg in successive years. In medieval England, storks were also associated with adultery, possibly inspired by their courtship rituals. Their preening and posture saw them linked with the attribute of self-conceit.
