[ April 2012 ] { Staffordshire stoneware plate from the 1850s with transferred copper print – &apos;&apos;(From the home of } { J. L. Runeberg )&apos;&apos; } Stoneware is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic ware made primarily from non- refractory fire clay. { Standard Terminology of Ceramic Whiteware and Related Products: ASTM Standard C242. } [ Definition and description ] { Portugal in 2008 } { vase from the } { Song Dynasty, 11th century } One widely-recognized definition is from the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities, a European industry standard. It states: &quot; Stoneware, which, though dense, impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point, differs from porcelain because it is more opaque, and normally only partially vitrified. It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous. It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture, and is normally glazed. &quot; { Arthur Dodd &amp; David Murfin. Dictionary of Ceramics; 3rd edition. The Institute of Minerals, 1994. } Formulations for stoneware vary considerably, although the vast majority will conform to: plastic fire clay s 0 –100%, ball clay s 0 –15%, quartz 0 –30% feldspar and chamotte 0 –15% { &quot; E-Learning item – Body Compositions &quot;. Ceram Research. } Stoneware is generally once-fired. { “Once-fired Ware - ceramic whiteware to which a glaze is applied before the ware is fired, the biscuit firing and glost firing then being combined in a single operation. Because the glaze must mature at a relatively high temperature, it is usually of the leadless type.” Arthur Dodd &amp; David Murfin. Dictionary of Ceramics; 3rd edition. The Institute of Minerals, 1994. } Maximum firing temperatures can vary significantly, from 1100 °C to 1300 °C depending on the flux content. { Paul Rado An Introduction to the Technology of Pottery; 2nd ed. Oxford: Published on behalf of the Institute of Ceramics by Pergamon, 1988 ISBN 0-08-034932-3 } Typically temperatures will be between 1180°C to 1280°C, the higher end of which equate to Bullers Rings 38 to 40 &amp; Seger cones 4 to 8. To produce a better quality fired glaze finish twice firing can be used, and this can be especially important for formulations composed of highly carbonaceous clays. For these, biscuit firing is around 900 °C and glost firing 1180 –1280 °C. Water absorption of stoneware products is less than 1%. { W. Ryan &amp; C. Radford.

Oxford: Published on behalf of the Institute of Ceramics by Pergamon, 1987 ISBN 0-08-034927-7 } { &quot; E-Learning item - Body Compositions &quot;. Ceram Research. } Five categories have been suggested: { F. Singer &amp; S. S. Singer. Industrial Ceramics. London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1963 } Traditional stoneware - a dense and inexpensive body. It is opaque, can be of any colour and breaks with a conchoidal or stony fracture. Traditionally made of fine-grained secondary, plastic clays which can used to shape very large pieces. Fine stoneware - made from more carefully selected, prepared and blended raw materials. It is used to produce tableware and art ware. Chemical stoneware - used in the chemical industry, and elsewhere when resistance to chemical attack is needed. Purer raw material s are used than for other stoneware bodies. Ali Baba is a popular name for a large chemical stoneware jars of up to 5,000 litres capacity used to store acids. Dictionary Of Ceramics. Arthur Dodd &amp; David Murfin. 3rd edition. The Institute Of Minerals. 1994. Thermal shock resistant stoneware – has additions of certain materials to enhance the thermal shock resistance of the fired body. Electrical stoneware - historically has been used for electrical insulators, although has been replaced by electrical porcelain. Another type, Flintless Stoneware, has also been identified. It is defined in the UK Pottery (Health and Welfare) Special Regulations of 1950 as: &quot; Stoneware, the body of which consists of natural clay to which no flint or quartz or other form of free silica has been added. &quot; { Arthur Dodd &amp; David Murfin. Dictionary of Ceramics; 3rd edition. The Institute Of Minerals, 1994. } [ History and notable examples ] The earliest example of stoneware is found in China, naturally as an extension of higher temperatures achieved from early development of reduction firing. { Sato, Masahiko. Chinese Ceramics: A Short History (1st edition). John Weatherhill, Inc. (1981), p.15. } From the various definitions of high-fired ceramics, it is agreed that the earliest stoneware is encountered in the late Shang dynasty in China, with large quantities in production by the Han dynasty. { Li, He.

During the 19th and the earlier part of the 20th century, however, cane ware continued to be made in South Derbyshire and the Burton-on-Trent area as kitchen-ware and sanitary-ware; it had a fine-textured cane-coloured body with a white engobe on the inner surface often referred to as cane and white.
