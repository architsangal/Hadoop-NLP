[ KTX logo.png 67px KTX Engine.JPG A KTX-I in Seoul Station. 한국고속철도 韓國高速鐵道 Han-guk Kosok Ch&apos;ŏldo Han-guk Gosok Cheoldo ] Korea Train eXpress (KTX) is South Korea &apos;s high-speed rail system, operated by Korail. Construction began on the first section of the high-speed line from Seoul to Busan in 1992. The project was later split into two phases and combined with conventional line upgrades, adding a second route from Seoul to Mokpo. The system&apos;s technology is largely based on the French TGV / LGV system, but domestic development based on transferred technology began early. The first phase of the project was completed and KTX services were launched on April 1, 2004. After missing forecasts and running deficits in the first year, KTX increased ridership and market share, transporting over 100,000 passengers daily and making a profit for Korail since 2007. The second phase of the Seoul–Busan line entered service on November 1, 2010, with two sections crossing urban areas to be completed by 2014. Construction of a second high-speed line to Mokpo began in December 2009, and is to open in 2014. Other new lines and upgraded conventional lines are in various stages of planning or construction, including one to serve the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. Top speed for trains in regular service is currently [ 305 km/h mph on 0 ], though the infrastructure is designed for [ 350 km/h mph 3 on ]. The initial rolling stock, designated KTX-I, was based on Alstom &apos;s TGV Réseau, and was partly built in Korea within the framework of a technology transfer. The domestically developed HSR-350x prototype, which achieved the South Korean rail speed record of [ 352.4 km/h mph on ] in tests, resulted in a second type of high-speed trains now operated by Korail, the KTX-II, later renamed KTX-Sancheon. Research on another prototype, the HEMU-400X, is underway to develop the [ 350 km/h mph on 0 ] KTX-III by 2014. [ History ] [ Origins of the project ] The Seoul-Busan axis is Korea&apos;s main traffic corridor. In 1982, it represented 65.8% of South Korea&apos;s population, a number that grew to 73.3% by 1995, along with 70% of freight traffic and 66% of passenger traffic. With both the Gyeongbu Expressway and Korail &apos;s Gyeongbu Line congested as of the late 1970s, the government saw the pressing need for another form of transportation. [ Cho Chung 2008 11 ] The first proposals for a second Seoul-Busan railway line originated from a study prepared between 1972 and 1974 by experts from France&apos;s SNCF and Japan Railway Technical Service on a request from the IBRD. [ Cho Chung 2008 13–14 ] [ http://www.jarts.or.jp/project/project_i.html Major Projects Overseas - I-K Japan Railway Technical Service 2010-08-26 ] A more detailed 1978-1981 study by KAIST, focusing on the needs of freight transport, also came to the conclusion that separating long-distance passenger traffic on a high-speed passenger railway would be advisable, and it was adopted in the following Korean Five Year Plan. [ Cho Chung 2008 14 ] During the following years, several feasibility studies were prepared for a high-speed line with a Seoul–Busan travel time of 1 hour 30 minutes, which gave positive results. [ Cho Chung 2008 14 ] In 1989, following the go-ahead for the project, the institutions to manage its preparation were established: the Gyeongbu High Speed Electric Railway &amp; New International Airport Committee, and the High Speed Electric Railway Planning Department (later renamed HSR Project Planning Board). [ Cho Chung 2008 14–15 ] In 1990, the planned Seoul–Busan travel time was 1 hour 51 minutes, the project was to be completed by August 1998, [ Cho Chung 2008 42 ] and costs were estimated at 5.85 trillion South Korean won [ Cho Chung 2008 42 ] in 1988 prices, 4.6 trillion of which were to be spent on infrastructure, the remainder on rolling stock. [ D. Suh 2000 56 ] As planning progressed, the Korea High Speed Rail Construction Authority (KHSRCA) was established in March 1992 as a separate body with its own budget responsible for the project. [ Cho Chung 2008 15 ] In the 1993 reappraisal of the project, the completion date was pushed back to May 2002, and cost estimates grew to 10.74 trillion won. [ Cho Chung 2008 42 ] [ D. Suh 2000 56 ] 82% of the cost increase was due to a 90% increase in unit costs in the construction sector, mostly labour costs but also material costs, [ D. Suh 2000 62 ] and the remainder due to alignment changes. [ Cho Chung 2008 42 ] [ D. Suh 2000 62 ] To finance the project, the option of a build-operate-transfer (BOT) franchise was rejected as too risky. [ D. Suh 2000 61 ] Funding included direct government grants (35%), government (10%) and foreign (18%) loans, domestic bond sales (31%) and private capital (6%). [ D. Suh 2000 58 ] [ Creation of the system ] [ Start of high-speed line construction ] [ Gyeongbu High Speed Railway ] KTX network map in October 2011 KHSRCA started construction of the Seoul–Busan Gyeongbu High Speed Railway (Gyeongbu HSR) on June 30, 1992, on the [ 57 km mi on ] long section from Cheonan to Daejeon, which was intended for use as test track. [ D. Suh 2000 56 ] Construction started before the choice of the main technology supplier, thus alignment design was set out to be compatible with all choices. [ D. Suh 2000 56 ] Of the planned [ 411 km mi on ] line, [ 152.73 km mi on ] would be laid on bridges, and another [ 138.68 km mi on ] in tunnels. [ D. Suh 2000 56 ] However, plans were changed repeatedly, [ D. Suh 2000 56–57 ] in particular those for city sections, following disputes with local governments, [ D.

On long-distance relations with significant distances along conventional lines and resulting more modest travel time gains, that is along the Honam Line, the KTX and overall rail market share gain decreases with distance. On medium-distance relations like Seoul–Daejeon, KTX gained market share mostly at the expense of normal rail express services and air traffic, and helped to increase the total share of rail. On short distance intercity relations line Seoul–Cheonan, due to the modest gains in time and the location of KTX stops outside city cores, KTX gains were at the expense of conventional rail, while intercity rail&apos;s modal share was little changed.
