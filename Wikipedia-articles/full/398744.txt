[ April 2011 ] [ 1866 1 27 yes ] { Williamstown, Victoria } { 10 January 1922 (age 55) } { Richmond, Victoria } { Australian } { Australian Labor Party } { Fanny Jane Mead } Francis Gwynne &quot; Frank &quot; Tudor (29 January 1866 – 10 January 1922) was an Australian-born felt hatter and politician. He was the leader of the Australian Labor Party from 1916 till his death. [ Early life ] Tudor was born to John Llewellyn Tudor, a ballastman, and Ellen Charlotte Tudor, née Burt, both of Welsh origin, on 29  January 1866 at Williamstown, Victoria. However, the family soon moved to the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, where Tudor lived all his life.

Tudor apprenticed in Abbotsford and then travelled across Victoria in the hat trade. Tudor went to England, working in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, marrying Alice Smale in Denton, Lancashire in 1894. Smale died the same year, but Tudor continued in the felt hat trade by moving to London and becoming vice-president of the local branch of the Felt Hatters&apos; Union. In 1897 Tudor remarried to Fanny Jane Mead. As vice-president of the union Tudor became interested in union politics (as many Labor politicians were before their entry into politics) and persuaded the British unions to adopt the union label principle. Returning to Australia, Tudor worked at Abbotsford &apos;s mills and took a seat in the Victorian Trades Hall Council. In 1900 he became president. [ Entry into politics ] A prominent figure in Richmond, Victoria, Tudor turned the Division of Yarra into the safest Labor seat in the country by winning that seat by a large margin in the 1901 federal election. Tudor was a deacon of the Congregational Church and angered some Protestants with his calls for Home Rule for Ireland. { 1901 election, including } { Chris Watson, } { Andrew Fisher, } { Billy Hughes, and Tudor, front left. } Tudor was immediately elected the Labor Party&apos;s whip and assistant secretary. He ascended to the position of secretary in 1904, then Minister for Trade and Customs during the three Fisher ministries, from 1908–1909, 1910–1913, 1914–1915.

Hughes left the Labor Party at the end of 1916 to form the Nationalist Party.

Tudor&apos;s success in preventing conscription was evident when a plebiscite was held and defeated in 1916. In 1919, T. J. Ryan, Premier of Queensland, was transferred to federal politics to serve under Tudor as a deputy. Because of Tudor&apos;s ineffectual performance, the party was contemplating a new leader, and Ryan would have probably replaced Tudor had he not died in 1921. It was predicted that Tudor would lose the 1919 election. [ November 2009 ] These predictions were correct, and Labor was defeated again. In 1921 Tudor&apos;s health declined and he was increasingly unable to carry out his duties; nevertheless, the party did not allow him to resign. [ November 2009 ] [ Death ] Tudor died on 10 January 1922, aged 55, the first leader of the Labor Party to die in office, and the first Opposition Leader never to become Prime Minister.
