Before 1979, they were based in Fukuoka in Kyushu. The team is owned by a subsidiary of Prince Hotels, which in turn is owned by the Seibu Group. The team experienced a recent period of financial difficulty, but the situation brightened when the team received a record ¥ 6 billion (about $ 51.11 million) posting fee from the Boston Red Sox for the right to negotiate a contract with Daisuke Matsuzaka. Between 1978 and 2008, the team logo and mascot were based on the adult version of Kimba the White Lion, a classic Japan ese anime series by Osamu Tezuka. { Although many fans, team officials, and members of the press consider the mascot to be a variation of Kimba, Tezuka has stated that it is based on Caesar, the father of Kimba. } [ December 2007 ] { The Lions adopted a new mascot for the 2009 season. } [ January 2009 ] In 2004, former Seibu Lions player Kazuo Matsui became the first Japanese infielder to play in Major League Baseball. { Colorado Rockies. 2006.

It was then owned by Nishi-Nippon Railroad, which was based in Fukuoka. The team finished sixth that year, and at the end of the season was merged with the Nishi-Nippon Pirates to form the Nishitetsu Lions. [ Nishitetsu Lions (1951–1972) ] The Nishitetsu Lions were one of a dominant team in the Pacific League during the 1950s, winning four pennants three straight Japan Series against the Yomiuri Giants behind famed manager Osamu Mihara. The team struggled through the following decade and did witness much success on the field. In November 1972 was sold to the Fukuoka Baseball Corporation, also a part of Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Following the sale, the team was renamed the Taiheiyo Club Lions. The Nishitetsu Lions called Heiwadai Stadium home for their entire existence. [ Taiheiyo Club Lions (1973–1976) ] Nishi-Nippon Railroad, founded by Nagayoshi Nakamura, owner of Lotte and the Orions, sold the team&apos;s sponsorship rights to Taiheiyo Club, a golf course and resort developer. Through the 1970s, the Lions finished no higher than third. [ Crown Lighter Lions (1977–1978) ] At the end of the 1976 season, the Fukuoka Baseball Corporation announced that the team&apos;s new sponsor was Crown Gas Lighter. With this, the team&apos;s name for the upcoming season was changed to the Crown Lighter Lions. At the end of the 1978 season, the team was sold to Kokudo Keikaku (later Kokudo), and then merged into Prince Hotels. [ Seibu Lions (1979–2007) ] Following the sale of the Crown Lighter Lions and their merging into Price Hotels, the team was renamed the Seibu Lions and relocated to a new ballpark in Tokorozawa, Saitama. [ The Golden Age (1982–1994) ] The Lions finished in last place following the 1979 season. However, the following seasons would mark the beginning of a period of sustained success for the team under new manager Tatsuro Hirooka and with star players such as Osamu Higashio and Koichi Tabuchi. The club won two-year straight Japan Series in 1982 and 1983, and won the championship again in 1985. Following the 1986 season, the club replaced Hirooka with Masaaki Mori, who was able to sustain the team&apos;s prolonged success. Mori won 8 league championship, between 1986 and 1988 and 1990–1994, and six Japan Series championships in his nine-year managing career, winning the Japan Series in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, and 1992. The team gained the moniker &quot; Invincible Seibu &quot; during the 1980s and 1990s due to their sustained domination of the league. The Lions had a powerful lineup in this period, loaded with sluggers such as Kouji Akiyama, Kazuhiro Kiyohara and Orestes Destrade. Their defense also benefited from the services of skilled players such as Hiromichi Ishige, Hatsuhiko Tsuji and catcher Tsutomu Ito. Among the pitchers employed by the Lions in this period was &quot; The Oriental Express &quot; Taigen Kaku, Kimiyasu Kudoh, Hisanobu Watanabe, and relievers Yoshitaka Katori and Testuya Shiozaki.

They were Pacific League Champions that year and went on to win the Japan Series. The team logo and uniforms were further modified for the 2009 season, with the team trading in their traditional light-blue colour scheme for a dark blue design similar to that employed during the Nishitetsu Lions&apos; era in the 1950s and 1960s.
