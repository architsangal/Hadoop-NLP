He was particularly concerned with the plight of &apos;European-Americans.&apos; He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the &apos;growing underclass.&apos; He used the tried and true demagoguery of class envy to sell his message: excessive taxpayers&apos; money spent on welfare, school busing practices, affirmative action... and set-aside programs.
