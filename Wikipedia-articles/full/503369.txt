It has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. It has a secondary listing on Euronext Amsterdam. On 31 May 2012 Canada&apos;s CGI Group agreed to acquire Logica in a £1.7bn cash deal. [ History ] [ 20th century ] Logica was founded by Len Taylor, Philip Hughes and Pat Coen as a systems integration business in 1969. { Logica History } Early projects included the control system for the natural gas grid in the UK in 1971 and the design of the SWIFT network for international money transfers in 1973. In 1974, Logica, together with the French company SESA, set up a joint venture, Sesa-Logica, to undertake the European Informatics Network development. This project, undertaken with the support of partners throughout Europe and with the assistance of Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge, Massachusetts, brought the core datagram technology of the Arpanet, now the Internet, to Europe for the first time, and established a network linking research centres in a number of European Countries, including CERN, the French research centre INRIA and the UK’s National Physical Laboratory. { Origins, development and future of the Euronet } In 1975, Logica developed the first electronic typing pool – Unicom – for Unilever. [ http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res19.htm#d The Unicom Project Peter Hall Resurrection 0958-7403 19 Spring 1998 Computer Conservation Society 2 July 2010 ] This development allowed the complete functions of a typing pool to be automated into a single system supporting about 50 workstations. With the support of the UK’s National Enterprise Board the company established a new subsidiary to exploit this technology, Logica VTS. A range of stand alone word processors, the VTS 100 and the VTS 2200, were developed and were manufactured at a purpose built factory in Swindon. These machines were sold internationally by BT and by International Computers Ltd and were amongst the first word processors to achieve mass sales. However the advent of the Personal Computer and software such as Microsoft Word led to the decline of this business and its ultimate closure. { Computer resurrection: the Unicom project } At this time Logica set up operating subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, the United States and elsewhere as well as joint ventures in Hong Kong with Jardine Matheson, in Italy with Finsiel and in the UK with British Airways. The Company floated on the London Stock Exchange on 26 October 1983. In 1984 the Company developed the automated clearing system for the UK banks ( CHAPS ) as well as the customer service system for British Telecom. The Company pioneered the automated ticketing system for London Underground in 1987 and the system which randomly generates premium bond numbers ( ERNIE ) in 1988. During the late 1980s and early 1990s the Company was led by David Mann. { Charteris: Directors and Managers } Dr Martin Read was recruited from GEC Marconi and appointed CEO in August 1993. Most of the executive directors left the company during the two years following his appointment - David Mann, Colin Rowland Andrew Karney, Ian Macleod and Cliff Preddy. { More directors leave Logica } In 2001 the Company secured an outsourcing contract to create and operate a new case management system for the Crown Prosecution Service. { Logica: Global Outsourcing from a Welsh Hub } At this time the level of Dr Read&apos;s remuneration received attention when it was revealed that he enjoyed a £28 million pay packet. { Little man with a beard and a £28m pay packet } [ 21st century ] The merger of Logica (60%) with CMG (40%), on 30 December 2002, represented the union of an established technology firm (Logica) with an established consulting firm (CMG). { Jobs cull logical in Logica / CMG deal } In December 2003 LogicaCMG’s software controlled the Beagle 2 probe after separation from the Mars Express orbiter. { Beagle probe enters crucial phase } In 2005 LogicaCMG purchased 60% of the Portuguese company Edinfor, and in March 2008 purchased the remaining 40%. In 2006, LogicaCMG purchased the French company Unilog and the Swedish company WM-data. The Company suffered some embarrassment in 2006 when laptop s containing police payroll data were stolen from LogicaCMG { Met police payroll details stolen } and an outsourcing contract with Transport for London for IT services was terminated early after disputes over payments and service level agreements. { TfL signs temporary outsourcing agreement } On 20 February 2007 LogicaCMG Telecom Products was sold for £265m (US $525m) to private investors Atlantic Bridge Ventures and Access Industries and became known as Acision. { LogicaCMG sells Telecom Products } Following a profit warning in 2007, { Logica profit warning hits shares } Andy Green was recruited as the new CEO and took office from 1 January 2008. { Logica appoints BT&apos;s Green as new CEO } On 27 February 2008, the Company changed its name back to Logica. In April 2008 Green announced a major restructuring programme for the company, leading to 1,300 job losses. { Logica UK sales stall } Also in May 2008 the Company announced that it would offshore more of its activities including SAP support and HR and payroll administration to Makati City in the Philippines { UK’s Logica to outsource more work to RP } and has seen a subsequent increase in its outsourced HR and payroll services business to more than 850 customer organisations. { Logica press release - includes figures on scale of HR BPO operations } In December 2011 Logica announced it would axe 1,300 jobs or around 3 percent of the workforce spread across Benelux, the United Kingdom and Sweden and save Logica 50 to 60 million pounds sterling a year from the second half of 2012.
