Incumbents are permitted to stand for re-election. A formula is used to allocate votes so there is a balance between the population of each state and the number of votes assembly members from a state can cast, and to give an equal balance between State Assembly members and National parliament members. If no candidate receives a majority of votes, then there is a system by which losing candidates are eliminated from the contest and their votes are transferred to other candidates, until one gains a majority.

However, this status was only a temporary measure, as India&apos;s political leadership did not consider it appropriate for the new country to share a monarch with the former colonial power. The monarch was represented in India by a Governor-General. The first person to hold this office was Admiral of the Fleet Louis Mountbatten,1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, who had also been the last British Viceroy of India. Mountbatten was soon replaced by C. Rajagopalachari, the only ethnic Indian to hold the office of Governor-General. In the meantime, the Constituent Assembly of India (under the leadership of Dr Rajendra Prasad ) was in the process of drafting a completely new constitution for the country. The Constitution of India was eventually enacted on 26 November 1949, and came into force on 26 January 1950. [ Sharma Sharma B.k.

The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by Members of Parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in a state matters; if a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes. The actual calculation for votes cast by a particular state is calculated by dividing the state&apos;s population by 1000, which is divided again by the number of legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. For votes cast by those in Parliament, the total number of votes cast by all state legislators is divided by the number of members of both Houses of Parliament. This is the number of votes per member of either house of Parliament. In 2007, the President of India was elected indirectly by the members of the Indian Parliament and by the individual States&apos; Legislative Assemblies. Although Indian presidential elections involve actual voting by MPs and MLAs, they tend to vote for the candidate supported by their respective parties.

Members of the electoral college are free to vote according to their conscience and and not bound to follow party whip. Since the election is by secret voting, political parties cannot identify the voting patterns easily. [ Constitutional role ] Article 53(1) of the Constitution vests in the President &quot; [t]he executive power of the Union &quot;, to be &quot; exercised by him [sic] either directly or through officers subordinate to him &quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. However, the Constitution also states that the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is &quot; to &quot; aid and advise the President who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice &quot;. However, the Article 74(2) bars all courts completely from assuming even an existence of such an advice. Therefore from the courts&apos; point of view, the real executive power lies with the President. As far as President&apos;s decision and action are concerned no one can challenge such decision or action on the ground that it is not in accordance with the advice tendered by the Ministers or that it is based on no advice. { S. R. Bommai Vs Union of India: Supreme Court of India, page 169, 11 March 1994, http://judis.nic.in } The President of India shall, before entering upon his office, make and subscribe in the presence of the Chief Justice of India or, in his absence, the senior-most Judge of the Supreme Court available, an oath or affirmation that he/she shall protect, preserve and defend the Constitution (Article 60).

[ Removal ] The President may be removed before the expiry of the term through impeachment. A President can be removed for violation of the Constitution of India. { Article 56 (1) (b) and Article 61 of the Constitution of India. } The process may start in either of the two houses of the Parliament. The house initiates the process by levelling the charges against the President. The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by at least one quarter of the total members of that house. The notice is sent up to the President and 14 days later, it is taken up for consideration. A resolution to impeach the President has to be passed by a two-third majority of the total members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the President has the right to defend oneself through an authorised counsel. If the second house also approves the charges made by two-thirds majority again, the President stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated his/her office from the date when such a resolution stands passed. Other than impeachment, no other penalty can be given to the President for the violation of the Constitution. { Universal&apos;s Guide to the Constitution of India ]. pg no 69. } No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.

When the President is unable to act because of absence, illness or any other cause, the Vice President discharges the President&apos;s functions until the President resumes the duties. A Vice President who acts as or discharges the functions of the President has all the powers and immunities of the President and is entitled to the same emoluments as the President. The Indian Parliament has by an enactment made provision for the discharge of the functions of the President when vacancies occur in the offices of the President and of the Vice President simultaneously, owing to removal, death, resignation of the incumbent or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the Chief Justice, or in his absence, the senior most Judge of the Supreme Court of India available discharges the functions of the President until a newly elected President enters upon his office or a newly elected Vice President begins to act as President under Article 65 of the Constitution, whichever is the earlier.

In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning Presidential intervention. Some of the more noteworthy are documented here. In 1979, the Prime Minister, Charan Singh, did not enjoy a Parliamentary majority. He responded to this by simply not advising the President to summon Parliament. Since then, Presidents have been more diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to convene Parliament and prove their majority within reasonable deadlines (2 to 3 weeks). In the interim period, the Prime Ministers are generally restrained from making policy decisions. The constitution gives the President the power to return a bill unsigned but it circumscribes the power to send it back only once for reconsideration. If the Parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the President is bound to sign it.

In such cases, Presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a Prime Minister prove he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote on the floor of the House) within weeks of being sworn in to office. [ May 2012 ] Since the Constitution does not provide any time limit within which the President is to declare his assent or refusal, the President could exercise this veto by not taking any action for an indefinite time; but if the ministry has a strong backing in Parliament, it would not be possible for him to do so even though he\she can do it. Pocket Veto was used in 1986 by the then President Zail Singh in the Postal Bill.

Narayanan introduced the important practice of explaining to the nation (by means of Rashtrapati Bhavan communiqués) the thinking that led to the various decisions he took while exercising his discretionary powers; this has led to openness and transparency in the functioning of the President.
