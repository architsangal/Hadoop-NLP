After serving 19 years of imprisonment in Italy, he was deported to Turkey, where he served a ten-year sentence. He was released on January 18, 2010.

[ Early life ] [ December 2010 ] Ağca was born in the Hekimhan district, Malatya Province in Turkey. As a youth, he became a petty criminal and a member of street gangs in his home town. He became a smuggler between Turkey and Bulgaria. He claims to have received two months of training in weaponry and terrorist tactics in Syria as a member of the left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine paid for by the Communist Bulgaria n government, although this has been questioned. [ Grey Wolves involvement ] After training he went to work for the far-right Turkish Grey Wolves, who were at the time destabilizing Turkey, which led to a military coup in 1980. It has been claimed ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves were being used by the CIA. For instance, according to Kendal Nezan of the Kurdish Institute of Paris, they were infiltrated and manipulated by Gladio &quot; stay-behind &quot; networks, a NATO clandestine structure. [ Kendal Nezan Kendal Nezan Turkey&apos;s pivotal role in the international drug trade 1998-07-05 Le Monde Diplomatique http://mondediplo.com/1998/07/05turkey ] On February 1, 1979 in Istanbul, under orders from the Grey Wolves, he murdered Abdi İpekçi, editor of a major Turkish newspaper Milliyet. He was caught due to an informant and was sentenced to life in prison. After serving six months, he escaped with the help of Abdullah Çatlı, second-in-command of the Grey Wolves and a prominent Gladio operative, and fled to Bulgaria, which was a base of operation for the Turkish mafia. According to investigative journalist Lucy Komisar, Mehmet Ali Ağca had worked with Abdullah Çatlı in this 1979 assassination, who &quot; then reportedly helped organize Ağca&apos;s escape from an Istanbul military prison, and some have suggested Çatlı was even involved in the Pope&apos;s assassination attempt &quot;. According to Reuters, Ağca had &quot; escaped with suspected help from sympathizers in the security services &quot;.

He entered Rome on May 10, 1981, coming by train from Milan. [ December 2010 ] According to Ağca&apos;s later testimony, he met with three accomplices in Rome, one a fellow Turk and the other two Bulgarians. The operation was commanded by Zilo Vassilev, the Bulgarian military attaché in Italy. He said that he was assigned this mission by Turkish mafioso Bekir Celenk in Bulgaria. Le Monde diplomatique, however, has alleged that the assassination attempt was organized by Abdullah Çatlı &quot; in exchange for the sum of 3 million marks &quot;, paid by Bekir Celenk to the Grey Wolves. { Martin A. Lee, &quot; Les liaisons dangereuses de la police turque, &quot; } { Le Monde diplomatique, 3 March 1997. } According to Ağca, the plan was for him and the back-up gunman Oral Çelik to open fire in St. Peter&apos;s Square and escape to the Bulgarian embassy under the cover of the panic generated by a small explosion. On May 13 they sat in the square, writing postcards and waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed them, Ağca fired several shots and wounded him, but was grabbed by spectators and Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin and prevented from finishing the assassination or escaping. Four bullets hit John Paul II, two of them lodging in his lower intestine, the others hitting his left hand and right arm. Two bystanders were also hit. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire. The Pope survived the assassination attempt. [ Prison time, release, and rearrest ] Ağca was sentenced, in July 1981, to life imprisonment in Italy for the assassination attempt. Following his shooting, Pope John Paul II asked people to &quot; pray for my brother (Ağca), whom I have sincerely forgiven. &quot; [ http://m.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n%3D5704 Holy See defers to courts on possible release of would-be Papal assassin M.catholicnewsagency.com 2006-01-09 ] Although Ağca had been quoted as saying that &quot; to me [the Pope] was the incarnation of all that is capitalism &quot;, and had attempted to murder him, Ağca developed a friendship with the pontiff. [ oct 2009 March 2010 ] In 1983, he and Ağca met and spoke privately at the prison where Ağca was being held. The Pope was also in touch with Ağca&apos;s family over the years, meeting his mother in 1987 and his brother a decade later.

[ http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id%3D3.0.3308559433 Italy: Turkish gunman wants to be baptised at the Vatican Adnkronos.com ] Following his extradition to Turkey, he was imprisoned for the 1979 murder of Abdi İpekçi and for two bank raids carried out in the 1970s. Journalist Abdi İpekçi was killed on February 1, 1979. Ağca was arrested on June 25 and incarcerated in the Maltepe Military Prison. He fled to Bulgaria on 25 November and was sentenced to death in his absence. Ağca was extradited to Turkey in 2000 by benefiting from the Conditional Amnesty Law. This possibility granted to the ex-convict caused strong reactions. Both cases about Ağca were merged and tried before the Kadıköy 1st High Criminal Court. The single trial concerned the usurpation of Cengiz Aydos&apos; taxi in 1979, robbing the Yıldırm jewelry store in Kızıltoprak on March 22, 1979 and stealing money from the Fruko soda storage on April 4, 1979. On June 9, 1997, Air Malta Flight 830 was hijacked by two men. After landing in Cologne, the hijackers demanded the release of Ağca, who at the time was serving a life sentence in Italy for trying to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981. Ağca was not released and the hijackers surrendered. On 18 January 2000, the judges decreed for a dismissal of proceedings due to the statute of limitation regarding the case filed for the jewelry store robbery and for &quot; opposition to the Firearms Act &quot; (law no. 6136). For usurpation and money theft Ağca was handed a 36 year prison sentence. Ağca&apos;s lawyers applied for the release of their client deriving benefit from law no. 4516 related to Parole and Postponement of Penalties in December 2000. Their request was rejected by the Kartal 1st High Criminal Court. The lawyers filed an appeal against this decision which was declined again. Ağca was sentenced to 10 years in prison for murder. { Mehmet Ali Ağca Released 29 Years after Attack on Pope John Paul II } In early February 2005, during the Pope&apos;s illness, Ağca sent a letter to the Pope wishing him well and also warning him that the world would end soon. When the Pope died on April 2, 2005, Ağca&apos;s brother Adnan gave an interview in which he said that Ağca and his entire family were grieving, and that the Pope had been a great friend to them. On April 5, 2005 CNN stated that Ağca would want to visit the Pope&apos;s funeral on April 8, 2005. However, Turkish authorities rejected his request to leave prison to attend. [ December 2010 ] Ağca was released on parole on January 12, 2006.

However, a report from the French AFP news agency stated that &quot; The Turkish judicial authorities still haven&apos;t explained exactly which legal resources he had access to &quot;, and former minister of Justice Hikmet Sami Türk, in government at the time of Ağca&apos;s extradition, claimed that, from a legal viewpoint, his liberation was a &quot; serious mistake &quot; at best, and that he should have not been freed before 2012.

It was during his time in prison that he converted to Christianity in 2007. He claimed to be the Messiah at his trial and has made many bizarre statements over the years, although it has never been clear whether he is mentally unstable or merely acting.

Your life is in danger. You absolutely must not come to Turkey. Pope Benedict you must know that between 1980 and 2000 I was in contact with various Western intelligence services and with the Vatican. In those twenty years, I learnt many things and I came into possession of many classified secrets. For your own welfare, you must make a grand gesture of honour and resign. Then you must return to your native land (Germany) and in your place an Italian cardinal can be elected Pope, possibly Tettamanzi or Bertone. Then the Vatican should become a center of peace and fraternity. The world has a need of this, it does not need hatred and vendetta. ] Despite Ağca&apos;s warning, Pope Benedict&apos;s visit to Turkey proceeded as scheduled without any incidents.
