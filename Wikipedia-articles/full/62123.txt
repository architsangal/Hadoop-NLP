After his parents divorced, Burr moved to Vallejo, California with his mother and younger siblings, Geraldine and James Edmond. He attended a military academy for a while and graduated from Berkeley High School. { Starr, Hiding in Plan Sight, 10-3 } In later years, Burr freely invented stories of a happy childhood. He told the Modesto Bee in 1986, for example, that when he was twelve and a half years old, his mother sent him to New Mexico for a year to work as a ranch hand. He was already his full adult height and rather large and &quot; had fallen in with a group of college-aged kids who didn&apos;t realize how young Raymond was, and they let him tag along with them in activities and situations far too sophisticated for him to handle. &quot; { The Modesto Bee : Jane Ardmore &quot; Welcome Home to Perry Mason &quot;, June 3, 1986, accessed March 26, 2010 } He developed a passion for growing things and, while still a teenager, joined the Civilian Conservation Corps for a year.

In 1941, he landed his first Broadway role in Crazy with the Heat. He became a contract player at RKO studio, playing a film noir villain in Raw Deal (1948). Burr appeared in over 60 movies between 1946 and 1957. In 1976, Richard Schickel cited his performance in Pitfall (1948) as a prototype of film noir in contrast with the appealing television characters for which Burr later became famous. { Richard Schickel, &quot; Rerunning Film Noir, &quot; The Wilson Quarterly, vol. 31, no. 3, summer 2007, 43 } He received favorable notice for his role as an aggressive prosecutor in A Place in the Sun (1951), co-starring Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift and Shelly Winters. Perhaps his best-known film role of the period was that of a suspected murderer in the Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window (1954), starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly. He played the part of reporter Steve Martin in Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956). { Internet Movie Database: Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), accessed July 14, 2011 } Burr emerged as a prolific television character actor in the early-to-mid 1950s. He made his television debut on the April 24, 1952 episode &quot; The Tiger &quot; of Gruen Playhouse on the DuMont TV network. (At about the same time, Burr guest-starred on an episode of The Amazing Mr. Malone on ABC.) This part led to other roles in such programs as Dragnet, Chesterfield Sound Off Time, Four Star Playhouse, Mr. &amp; Mrs. North, Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, The Ford Television Theatre, and Lux Video Theatre. During this time, Burr&apos;s distinctive voice could also be heard on network radio, appearing alongside Jack Webb in the short-lived Pat Novak for Hire on ABC radio, as well as in early episodes of NBC&apos;s Dragnet. He also made guest appearances on other Los Angeles-based shows, such as Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar and landed a starring role in CBS &apos;s Fort Laramie (1956), { Batz, Bob Radio Buff Savor the Glory Days. Dayton Daily News. April 28, 1991.

The 41 episodes all featured Raymond Burr as Lee Quince, captain of the cavalry. } One year later, Burr became a television star as Perry Mason. [ Perry Mason and Ironside ] In 1956, Burr auditioned for the role of District Attorney Hamilton Burger in Perry Mason, a new courtroom drama based on the highly successful novels written and created by Erle Stanley Gardner that was to air on CBS. William Talman tried out for the title role. The producers of the show allowed Burr to try for the title role and when Gardner, who was present at the audition, saw him he declared, &quot; He is Perry Mason. &quot; Mason eventually became the role with which Burr was most closely identified. { Talman, as Burger, lost every case he tried against Mason, the defense attorney who always forced a dramatic confession from the guilty party at the end of each episode.

Andy Anderson (after Collins left the show). } The series ran from 1957 to 1966, and Burr won Emmy Awards in 1959 and 1961 for his performance as Perry Mason. The series has been re-run in syndication ever since. [ July 2011 ] Beginning in 2006, the series has become available on DVD, with each calendar year seeing the release of one season as two separate volumes. Though Burr&apos;s character is often said never to have lost a case, he did lose two murder cases in early episodes of the series, once when his client misled him and another time when his client was later cleared. In the early 1960s, Burr narrated one film and appeared in several others sponsored by the U.S. Public Health Service. They were designed to educate the public about accident prevention. { &quot; An Assault on Accidents, &quot; American Journal of Nursing, vol. 62, no. 12, December 1962, 68 } Burr moved from CBS to Universal Studios, where he played the title role in the television drama Ironside, which ran on NBC. In the pilot episode, San Francisco Chief of Detective s Robert T. Ironside is wounded by a sniper during an attempt on his life and is left an invalid in a wheelchair. This role gave Burr another hit series, the first crime drama show ever to star a disabled police officer. The show, which ran from 1967 to 1975, earned Burr six Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations. Burr&apos;s weight, always an issue for him in getting roles, became a public relations problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his Tonight Show monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson&apos;s guest from then on and told Us Weekly years later: &quot; I have been asked a number of times to do his show and I won&apos;t do it. Because I like NBC. He&apos;s doing an NBC show. If I went on I&apos;d have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he&apos;s done about me, but bad jokes he does about everybody who can&apos;t fight back because they aren&apos;t there. And that wouldn&apos;t be good for NBC. &quot; { Starr, Hiding in Plain Sight, 184 } In later life his distinctive physique and manner could be used as a reference that would be universally recognized. One journal for librarians published a writer&apos;s opinion that &quot; asking persons without cataloging experience to design automated catalogs...is as practical as asking Raymond Burr to pole vault. &quot; { Verna Urbanski, &quot; Fear and Loathing in Library Science, &quot; Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, vol. 33, no. 1, winter 1992, 59.

Maxine Chernoff, &quot; Death Swap, Mississippi Review, vol. 18, no. 1, 1989, 77 } NBC failed in two attempts to launch Burr as the star of a new series. In a two-hour television movie format, Mallory: Circumstantial Evidence aired in February 1976 with Burr again in the role of the lawyer who outwits the district attorney. Despite good reviews for Burr, the critical reception was poor and NBC decided against developing it into a series. { Internet Movie Database: Mallory: Circumstantial Evidence (TV 1976), accessed July 15, 2011; Starr, Hiding in Plain Sight, 177-8 } In 1977, Burr starred in the short-lived TV series Kingston: Confidential, a critical failure that was scheduled opposite the extraordinarily popular Charlie&apos;s Angels.

Many episodes were filmed in and around Denver, Colorado. By 1993, when Burr signed with NBC for another season of Mason films, he was using a wheelchair full-time because of his failing health. In his final Mason movie, The Case of the Killer Kiss, he was shown either sitting or standing while leaning on a table, but only once standing unsupported for a few seconds. { O&apos;Conner, John J. &apos;&apos;Review/Television; Case of the Missing Mason&apos;&apos;.

These include marriage to Scottish actress Annette Sutherland, supposedly killed in the same plane crash as Leslie Howard. A son, Michael Evan, was said to have resulted from another invented marriage to Laura Andrina Morgan.

Because there was no son. &quot; } As late as 1991, Burr told Parade magazine that when he realized his son was dying, he took him on a one-year tour of the United States. He said, &quot; Before my boy left, before his time was gone, I wanted him to see the beauty of his country and its people. &quot; His publicist knew that Burr worked in Hollywood throughout the year he said he was touring with his son. { Starr, Hiding in Plain Sighrt, 216 } As with Burr&apos;s claims to have served in the U.S. military, many of these fictions were believed and widely reported. { &quot; Raymond Burr, 76, Dies of Cancer &quot;, Los Angeles Daily News, September 14, 1993 } In the late 1950s, Burr was rumored to be romantically involved with Natalie Wood. Wood&apos;s agent sent her on public dates so she could be noticed by directors and producers and so that the actors could present themselves in public as heterosexuals. The dates also helped to disguise Wood&apos;s intimate relationship with Robert Wagner, whom she later married. { Starr, Hiding in Plain Sight, 64-5, 67-70; Hofler, The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson, } [ September 2010 ] Burr felt enough attraction to Wood to resent Warner Bros. &apos; decision to promote her attachment to Tab Hunter instead.
