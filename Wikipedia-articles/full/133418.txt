The population was 17,578 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Penn School District. Towamencin has residential neighborhoods, historic farmhouses, recreational facilities, many schools, and open spaces. The community is a mix of residential, commercial and rural development. The Township is centrally located in the middle of Montgomery County with easy access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike ’s Northeast Extension. [ History ] [ Founding ] { The Morgan Log House } The first settlers, of German, Welsh, and Dutch descent, arrived in Towamencin Township around the turn of the 18th century. They mainly pursued agricultural endeavors to sustain their livelihood. The first grant of land in Towamencin Township was in 1703 from William Penn &apos;s Commissioners to Benjamin Furley on June 8. The Commissioners granted 1,000 acres (4  km²) to him. On June 17 of that same year, Abraham Tennis and Jan Lucken bought the property from him, and then divided the land in half in 1709. The Edward Morgan Log House stands on land that was part of 600 acres (2.4  km²) granted to Griffith Jones by the Commissioners. Edward Morgan purchased 309 acres (1.25  km²) of this land, which included an existing &quot; dwelling house &quot;, from Griffith Jones on February 26, 1708. In 1720, his daughter Sarah, who in 1734 would give birth to the famous frontiersman Daniel Boone, married Squire Boone. [ Edward Morgan House, 1973, Nomination Document National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places Washington, D.C ] The land containing the house was then deeded to John Morgan, son of Edward, on August 23, 1723 as part of a 104 acre (.42  km²) tract. [ http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php History of the Morgan Log House ] In March 1728 the settlers of the area petitioned William Penn &apos;s Commissioners for Towamencin to become a Township. The request was granted and a charter given. The land was surveyed and recorded, outlining the boundaries of the Township, known as antioch. Those boundaries are similar to what they are today. In the enumeration of 1734 there were 32 landholders within the Township, with William Tennis having the most area at 250 acres (1  km²). [ The Indians of Towamencin ] { Towamencin Vol. Fire Company } The American Indians who inhabited the area were the Lenni Lenape. They lived in Pennsylvania, as well as Delaware, New Jersey, and parts of Maryland. They were divided into three tribes: the Turtle, Turkeys, and Wolf, which were subdivided into clans, each clan having a name representing the character and situation of the tribe as a whole. The Indians of Towamencin Township are of the Delaware Nation. They had a settlement in the southwest section of the Township along the Towamencin Creek. They established friendly relations with the settlers when they came to the Township. There are some accounts of violence attributed to the Indians, but they cannot be proven and are probably fictional [ November 2010 ]. There are many accounts of Indians helping to tend the sick, and trading food and goods with the settlers. It is not recorded when the tribes of Indians left Towamencin; it is suspected they left after the Revolutionary War [ November 2010 ]. The Maltese Cross of the Towamencin Volunteer Fire Company has an American Indian in the center. [ American Revolutionary War ] Pennsylvania is known as the Keystone State for its role in the Revolution, and as one of the oldest settlements during the time, Towamencin Township played a part: the Township had encampments of soldiers, had many citizens that served, and was the retreating place for General Washington and his troops after the Battle of Germantown. The Continental Army troops were in Towamencin from October 8, 1777 to October 16, 1777 and camped in the Northern section of the Township. The Township provided a secure area to rest, without fear of surprise attack by the British. [ Specht J. Henry A History of Towamencin Township (Originally Published in 1947;Republished by Daughters of the American Revolution, Pennsylvania, Towamencin Chapter) 1974 Lansdale PA 1–69 ] Washington commandeered Frederick Wampole&apos;s house to establish his quarters and conducted military duties from there. The house was located on Detwiler Road. General Francis Nash was wounded at the Battle of Germantown and was carried from Germantown to Towamencin. He was cared for at the Mennonite Meeting House, [ http://www.emu.edu/seminary/features/franconia Eastern Mennonite Seminary ] along with other wounded men of the Battle of Germantown. He died two days later and is buried there. It was reported that Henry Cassel, whose land was used as an encampment by the Colonists, submitted to the Continental Congress an estimate of damages to his property by Washington&apos;s Army. The damage was to 696 fence rails used for firewood. The cost to replace those rails was 8.14 pounds. It is not known whether the newly-formed government paid. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 9.7  square miles (25.1  km²), all of it land.

[ Township Strategic Plan ] The Towamencin Township Board of Supervisors recognized the need for a Five-Year Strategic Plan during the 2007 budget process. In early 2007 the Board authorized the formation of a Strategic Planning Committee. A committee of five residents, two supervisors, and the Township Manager was formed in late February, charged with developing a Five-Year Strategic Plan and a goal of completing it in time for the 2008 budget process. The committee expanded to six residents in mid-May. The committee began weekly meetings in March 2007, starting with the task of developing a Community Vision and Mission Statement. They then received planning inputs from all Department Heads and the Township Manager. At the end of the input process, the committee developed Priorities, which were then voted on by each member of the committee for prioritization. The committee then developed Goals, Sustainability Objectives and Implementation Tools and Techniques for each of the Priorities, segmenting them by areas of the Township Budget. The Strategic Plan was then briefed to the Board of Supervisors 22 August 2007 by Mr. Fred Seipt, who represented the entire committee. The plan was accepted and approved by the Board of Supervisors 26 September 2007. The Strategic Plan has been updated every year since. [ Bob Fritz, Beth Hegedus, Bob Klein, Juan Lacomba, David J.

An alternate etymology is a legend associated started in the 1720s when Heinrich Fry purchased some land near what is now known as the Towamencin Creek. On this tract of land was a Native village whose chief spoke broken English. He observed one day two men clearing trees near the creek and said &quot; Towha-men-seen &quot;, meaning &quot; Two men seen. &quot; As the legend goes, the chief&apos;s pronunciation stuck, and is how Towamencin got its name.
