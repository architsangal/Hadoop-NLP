{ Far side } [ The Far Side Gary Larson 180px Wiener Dog Art, one of many Far Sidecollections published in the United States, features an artist stamping a paint-covered dachshund on a canvas. Ended Chronicle Features (1980–1985) Universal Press Syndicate (1985–1995) print Humor, Satire January 1, 1980 January 1, 1995 Nature&apos;s Way ] The Far Side is a popular single-panel comic created by Gary Larson and syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate, which ran from January 1, 1980, to January 1, 1995. Its surrealistic humor is often based on uncomfortable social situations, improbable events, an anthropomorphic view of the world, logical fallacies, impending bizarre disasters, or the search for meaning in life. Larson&apos;s frequent use of animals and nature in the comic is popularly attributed to his background in biology. Reruns are still printed in many newspapers. The Far Side was carried by more than 1,900 daily newspapers, translated into 17 languages, and collected into calendars and 22 compilation books.

[ The comic ] Most The Far Side cartoons are a single rectangular panel, occasionally split into small sections of four, six, or eight for the purposes of a storyline. A caption or dialogue usually appears under the panel as typed text, although word-balloons are sometimes used for conversations. Sunday comics were double-sized, done in watercolor or colored pencils, with captions handwritten in Larson&apos;s own cursive. Most of Larson&apos;s comics relied on some combination of a visual and verbal gag, rather than just one or the other. Some recurring themes in the comic include people being stranded on desert island s, aliens, heaven, hell and the life of cavemen. Many cartoons focused on animals, especially cows, bears, dogs, flies and ducks. Notably, virtually all human characters portrayed in the comic were overweight or obese, and usually wearing glasses. Larson was recognized for his work on the strip with the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1985 and 1988, [ http://www.reuben.org/ncs/archive/divisions/panels.asp NCS Awards—Newspaper Panel National Cartoonists Society 2008-09-03 ] and their Reuben Award for 1990 and 1994. [ http://www.reuben.org/ncs/archive/divisions/reuben2.asp The Reuben Award 1975 to present National Cartoonists Society 2008-09-03 ] The Complete Far Side and The Prehistory of The Far Side include letters from angry readers alongside the comics. The letters were written to newspaper publishers and often demanded the removal of The Far Side. Despite these protests, The Far Side remained popular and continued to run in many newspapers. Larson himself often laughs at the controversies as evidenced in The Prehistory of The Far Side, in which he writes that the people complaining have usually misunderstood the cartoon. { Larson, Gary. The Prehistory of the Far Side } [ Publications ] Gary Larson produced 23 The Far Side books, which were all on the New York Times bestseller list. The cartoons were first collected in small books (see list below), and some were then republished in larger best-of collections such as The Far Side Galleries. Additional best-of collections were published, such as The Prehistory of The Far Side, culminating in the final publication, The Complete Far Side in 2003.

In 1989, The Prehistory of The Far Side was published to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the strip. In this book, Gary Larson discussed the development of The Far Side, the public&apos;s reaction to it, and presented a selection of his personal favorites from the cartoon&apos;s history, as well as previously unpublished sketches and strips rejected by his editor. In 2003, The Complete Far Side was released, containing nearly every The Far Side comic ever published (except for a few cartoons written for Christmas cards). The collection is also missing parody art pieces from Wiener Dog Art, some material from The Prehistory of The Far Side, and a panel run for a caption writing contest in the Telegram-Tribune newspaper. The set was released in two volumes (1980–1986 and 1987–1994), with a foreword by Steve Martin and an introduction by Larson&apos;s long-time editor Jake Morrisey. The first edition hardcover boxed set weighs [ 19.5 lb kg ]. Some of the comics were altered for this book, either featuring a different caption, correcting errors, or simply becoming colorized. In 2003, Gary Larson drew a cover for the November 17 edition of The New Yorker magazine, { The New Yorker cover 17-Nov-2003 } a prestigious offer he said he could not refuse. { The Lawrence Journal-World } [ On television ] [ Gary Larson&apos;s Tales from the Far Side ] In 1994, Larson produced an animated special, Tales from the Far Side, featuring his art style and gags from the strips. He produced a sequel in 1997. [ Online ] It is difficult to find many Far Side cartoons online, since Larson, his publishers, and lawyers have successfully persuaded people not to infringe on his copyright. There is a widely distributed letter online, attributed to Gary Larson, in which he explains the &quot; emotional cost &quot; to him of people displaying his cartoons on their websites and asks them to stop.
