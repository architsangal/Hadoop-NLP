IST is taken as the standard time as it passes through almost the centre of India. To communicate the exact time to the people, the exact time is broadcast over the state–owned All India Radio and Doordarshan television network. Telephone companies have dedicated phone numbers connected to mirror timeserver s that also relay the precise time. Another increasingly popular means of obtaining the time is through Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers.
