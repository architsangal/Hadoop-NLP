[ 0103466 The Larry Sanders Show ] It stars stand-up comedian Garry Shandling as vain, neurotic talk show host Larry Sanders, and centered on the running of his TV show, and the many people behind the scenes. It is notable for featuring celebrities playing exaggerated, self-parodying versions of themselves, and for its character-based humor. Other series which subsequently aired on HBO, such as Curb Your Enthusiasm, Extras, and Entourage, shared these traits. The series, in which Shandling used his experience as a guest host on The Tonight Show, is ranked by various critics and fans as one of the best TV comedies of the 1990s.

It was also included in Time magazine&apos;s list of the &quot; 100 Best TV Shows of All Time. &quot; [ Poniewozik James http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/completelist/0%2C%2C1651341%2C00.html The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME Time Magazine December 4, 2010 James Poniewozik ] The show won 24 major awards, including three Primetime Emmy Awards, five CableACE Awards, four American Comedy Awards, two British Comedy Awards, a BAFTA Award and a Satellite Award. It also received 86 nominations, including 56 Primetime Emmy Awards nominations, five Directors&apos; Guild of America nominations, six Writers&apos; Guild of America nominations, six American Comedy Awards nominations, three Golden Globe nominations, three Satellite Awards nominations and a GLAAD Award nomination. [ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103466/awards Awards for &quot; The Larry Sanders Show &quot; December 4, 2010 IMDb ] [ Premise ] [ Plot ] The show revolves around Larry Sanders ( Garry Shandling ), host of the fictional late night talk show The Larry Sanders Show. It chronicles the daily life of Larry; the show&apos;s producer, Arthur &quot; Artie &quot; ( Rip Torn ); Larry&apos;s sidekick, Hank Kingsley ( Jeffrey Tambor ); and the production staff, as they attempt to produce a successful talk show each night while dealing with celebrities, the network and everything in between. Episodes focus on both the professional and personal lives of the characters, with most shows focusing on Larry Sanders. However, ancillary characters are also prominently featured, among them Jerry, the show&apos;s head writer for the first and second seasons; Phil, the head writer beginning in season two; Beverly, Larry&apos;s assistant; Darlene, Hank&apos;s assistant until the fourth season; Brian, Hank&apos;s assistant beginning in the fourth season; Paula, the show&apos;s booker until the fifth season; and Mary Lou, the assistant booker and then booker starting in the fifth season. [ Different kind of sitcom ] The Larry Sanders Show mixed video-taped footage of the fictional broadcast show (which was recorded in front of an actual live studio audience) with &quot; behind the scenes &quot; footage shot on film (for example, Larry talking to his guests during the commercial break or the everyday workings of the office between shows). As such, it featured real-life celebrity guests as they appear on the talk show, but also as they appeared behind the scenes. This gave writers and the celebrity guest the opportunity to send up their media image while making the show more realistic. Much like Shandling&apos;s other work, The Larry Sanders Show presented its main character as rather selfish and neurotic (but also likable and charming), and it contained some &quot; meta &quot; touches, such as in the final episode, in which it is established that Garry Shandling exists in the Larry Sanders universe, and is the subject of a complaint by Sean Penn, involving Garry&apos;s narcissism and his behavior toward Penn&apos;s wife on the set of Hurlyburly. [ Catchphrases ] The show had two catchphrases used throughout its entire run, the most notable being &quot; Hey now &quot;, a phrase Hank repeats in the opening credits of the fictional talk show, and whenever he greets someone. In one episode, Hank says he invented the phrase when he accidentally said it to someone and liked it. In 2007, TV Land ranked &quot; Hey Now &quot; as the 87th Best Television catch phrase. &quot; No flipping &quot; is a phrase Larry uses to go to commercial breaks, encouraging the at-home audience not to use their remotes to flip to another channel. In the series finale, the last thing Larry says on his fictional talk show is, &quot; You may now flip. &quot; [ Episodes ] [ List of The Larry Sanders Show episodes ] Season Episodes Premiere Date End Date Timeslot 1 13 August 15, 1992 November 7, 1992 Saturdays at 10:00 PM 2 18 June 2, 1993 September 29, 1993 Wednesdays at 10:00 PM 3 17 June 22, 1994 October 12, 1994 4 17 July 19, 1995 November 22, 1995 5 13 November 13, 1996 February 26, 1997 6 11 March 15, 1998 May 31, 1998 Sundays at 10:00 PM [ Series overview ] [ Season 1 ] The first season premiered on August 15, 1992 and ended on November 7, 1992, and was an immediate success. For the first season, the show always began with Hank&apos;s introduction, and some early episodes of the show began with the opening credits of the fictional talk show, The Larry Sanders Show. In later seasons, the episodes often began without the fictional opening credits. The season was nominated for eight Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to Seinfeld. However, The Larry Sanders Show became the first cable TV series to be nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. Garry Shandling was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Rip Torn and Jeffrey Tambor were nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.

[ Season 2 ] The second season premiered on June 2, 1993 and ended on September 29, 1993. Jeremy Piven grew tired of playing the character Jerry, head writer of the fictional Larry Sanders Show talk show; because his character was not given much of a background. He left during season two on the episode &quot; Larry&apos;s Birthday &quot;, where Artie fired him because of his behavior on the show. Jerry later came back on the series finale to say good luck to Larry on his final show. Eventually, Phil replaced Jerry as the show&apos;s head writer. The story arc in this season involved Larry beginning a new relationship with his first wife, after he had divorced his second wife. Some popular episodes of the season were: &quot; Larry&apos;s Agent &quot;, in which Larry tries to fire his agent; &quot; Broadcast Nudes &quot;, in which Hank wants Darlene to pose naked in Playboy magazine (Linda Doucett, the actress who played Darlene and also Garry Shandling&apos;s girlfriend at the time, would later actually appear in the magazine); &quot; Larry&apos;s Birthday &quot; in which Larry doesn&apos;t want anyone throwing a party for his birthday; this is also the episode where Jerry (the head writer of the show) is fired; &quot; The Grand Opening &quot;, in which Hank tries to promote his new restaurant; &quot; Off Camera &quot;, in which Artie has to deal with all the stress that Larry suffers every show; and the season finale &quot; L.A or N.Y? &quot;, in which Larry leaves the show and moves to Montana, to protest the network&apos;s desire to shift the show&apos;s base from L.A. to New York. The show was nominated for four Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to Frasier and would continue losing to the same series for the rest of its run. Rip Torn was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy. Todd Holland was nominated for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for the episode &quot; Life Behind Larry &quot;. Garry Shandling, Paul Simms, Drake Sathers, Victor Levin and Maya Forbes where nominated for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for the episode &quot; Larry&apos;s Agent &quot;. [ Season 3 ] The season premiered on July 22, 1994 and ended on October 12, 1994. The original title credits of the show appear less frequently this season. Some of the most popular episodes of the season were: &quot; Montana &quot;, in which the show gets back on the air after Larry discovers that life in Montana is not to his liking; &quot; You&apos;re Having My Baby &quot;, in which a woman claims that she is having Larry&apos;s baby; &quot; Hank&apos;s Night in the Sun &quot;, in which Hank fulfills his dreams of becoming guest host for the show; &quot; The Mr. Sharon Stone Show &quot;, which Larry dates Sharon Stone and finds out what it means to be the less famous member of a show biz couple; and the season finale &quot; End of the Season &quot; in which Larry gets engaged to Roseanne Barr. The season was nominated for six Emmy awards, including, for the third year in a row, for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to Frasier again. Garry Shandling was nominated as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Rip Torn was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Todd Holland was nominated for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for &quot; Hank&apos;s Night in the Sun &quot;.

It received one nomination for the Directors Guild of America Award for Todd Holland for &quot; The Mr. Sharon Stone Show &quot;. [ Season 4 ] The season premiered on July 19, 1995 and ended on November 22, 1995. Darlene, Hank&apos;s loyal assistant left the show at the end of season three (the actress who portrayed her was previously in a relationship with Shandling, but the couple had become estranged between seasons). Supposedly Darlene was on vacation, but on the second episode of the fourth season, a letter arrived from Darlene telling Hank she decided to quit as his assistant to follow someone she describes as &quot; a holy man &quot; living in India. Later that same episode, Hank hires Brian, has reservations about him when he learns he is gay, but decides to keep him on when Brian is indirectly instrumental in Larry inviting Hank to join him for a game of poker. Darlene returned along with Jerry on the show&apos;s finale to congratulate Larry on his final show. Some of the most popular episodes of the show included: &quot; Rosanne&apos;s Return &quot;, in which Larry has to face Roseanne Barr after their engagement broke off; &quot; Arthur After Hours &quot;, in which it is revealed what Artie does after the show had an unsuccessful broadcast; &quot; Jeanne&apos;s Visit &quot;, in which Larry&apos;s ex-wife, Jeannie, visits the show, &quot; Hank&apos;s Sex Tape &quot;, in which Hank becomes incensed when Phil circulates a tape of him having sex; and the season finale &quot; Larry&apos;s On Vacation &quot;, in which Sandra Bernhard tries to take over the show. The season was nominated for 12 Emmy awards, including for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost for the third time in a row to Frasier.

Janeane Garofalo decided to leave due to decreasing screen time for her character Paula, the show&apos;s booker. Mary Lou, her assistant, replaced her as booker. In this season the show got a writer named Wendy. Also in this season, Jon Stewart became a frequent guest who threatened to replace Larry on the show. Some of the most famous episodes of the series were made in this season: &quot; Everybody Loves Larry &quot;, in which Larry starts suspecting that David Duchovny has sexual feelings for him; { Mink, Eric. &apos;SANDERS&apos; AND THE ART OF THE REAL, } { The New York Daily News, April 12, 1996, October 4, 2010. } &quot; My Name is Asher Kingsley &quot;, in which Hank explores his Jewish roots, much to the crew&apos;s dismay; &quot; Ellen, or Isn&apos;t She? &quot;, in which Larry and Artie try to find if Ellen DeGeneres is really a lesbian; &quot; The New Writer &quot;, in which Wendy begins working as a writer for the show, much to Phil&apos;s dismay; &quot; The Book &quot;, in which Larry is convinced to write an autobiography; &quot; Pain Equals Funny &quot;, in which Paula leaves the show; and the season finale, &quot; Larry&apos;s New Love &quot;, in which Hank is afraid the network is trying to replace him. The show was nominated for 16 Emmy awards, breaking the record for most nominations for a Comedy Series for an individual Emmy year.

[ Season 6 ] This was the final season of The Larry Sanders Show. It premiered on March 15, 1998 and ended on May 31, 1998. There is only one episode which began with the original show&apos;s opening. Most of the changes of the show occurred offscreen this season. Many of the show&apos;s writers left the show (all except Garry Shandling, Peter Tolan, and Judd Apatow), and a new writing staff was hired. Todd Holland, who directed more than 48 episodes of the show, only directed two episodes the sixth season. This season was also markedly less comedic than earlier ones. Sid, the cue card guy at the show, commits suicide on the 8th episode of the season, but this was not considered a huge change, because there were only three episodes left in the series at that point. Some of the most popular episodes of the season were: &quot; Another List &quot;, in which the network threatens to replace Larry with Jon Stewart unless he makes some changes; &quot; The Beginning of the End &quot;, in which the show gets a new creative consultant who wants to make big changes in the show; &quot; Adolf Hankler &quot;, in which Hank has to play Adolf Hitler, while Larry is on vacation and Jon Stewart guest hosts; &quot; Beverly&apos;s Secret &quot;, in which Beverly tries to tell the father of her baby she&apos;s pregnant; &quot; Putting the &apos;Gay&apos; Back in Litigation &quot;, in which Brian (Hank&apos;s assistant) sues Phil and the show for sexual harassment due to Phil&apos;s gay jokes; and the series finale: &quot; Flip &quot;, in which the cast gets ready for their final broadcast and Larry and Artie deal with Hank and the emotions of the crew. For its final Emmy year, it received 10 nominations, receiving its final nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series, but it lost once again to Frasier, for the fifth year in a row. Nevertheless, it won two Emmys: one for Todd Holland for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for his direction of the final episode of the show, another for Garry Shandling and Peter Tolan for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series also for the final episode of the show. Garry Shandling was nominated Outstanding Lead Actor in Comedy Series. Rip Torn and Jeffrey Tambor were nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in Comedy Series. It received one nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series: Richard Day, Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck for &quot; Putting the &apos;Gay&apos; Back in Litigation. &quot; It received only one nomination for Directors&apos; Guild of America Award: Todd Holland for the episode &quot; Flip. &quot; [ Series finale ] After six years on the air, HBO and Garry Shandling announced that the show would not continue for a seventh season. The series finale aired in May 1998. Garry Shandling says he was very proud of the show&apos;s popularity and was sad it couldn&apos;t continue. Members of the cast and crew expressed disappointment and even depression with the end of the show. The finale was written by Garry Shandling and Peter Tolan, and was directed with Todd Holland. They both won Emmy Awards for directing and writing the final episode. The episode was filmed in March 1998, the same month the season premiered, with a running time of 53 minutes (90 with commercials), unlike all the other episodes with a running time of 22 to 28 minutes. The episode aired 16 days after the finale of Seinfeld aired on May 31 and was watched by 2.5 million viewers, which was a significant number for HBO. The finale got very positive reviews from critics, especially in comparison to Seinfeld&apos;s season finale. Coincidentally, Jerry Seinfeld appears as himself in the Larry Sanders finale. The episode was nominated for five Emmy Awards and won two: Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for Todd Holland and Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for Shandling and Tolan.
