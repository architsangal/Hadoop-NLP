Graceland is a large white-columned mansion and [ 13.8 acre ha on ] estate that was home to Elvis Presley in Memphis, Tennessee. It is located at 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard in the vast Whitehaven community about 9 miles (14.5  km) from Downtown and less than four miles (6  km) north of the Mississippi border. [ Victor Adam The Elvis Encyclopedia 2008 Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co Ltd 978-0-7156-3816-3 208 ] It currently serves as a museum. It was opened to the public on June 7, 1982. The site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1991 and declared a National Historic Landmark on March 27, 2006. Graceland has become one of the most-visited private homes in America with over 600,000 visitors a year, behind the White House { Adams (2008), The Elvis Encyclopaedia, p.208 } and Biltmore Estate (900,000 visitors per year). [ June 2011 ] Elvis Presley died at the estate on August 16, 1977. Presley, his parents Gladys and Vernon Presley, and his grandmother, are buried there in what is called the Meditation Garden. A memorial gravestone for Presley&apos;s twin brother, Jesse Garon, is also at the site. [ History ] Graceland Farms was originally owned by S.C. Toof, founder of S.C. Toof &amp; Co., a commercial printing firm in Memphis, who was previously the pressroom foreman of the Memphis newspaper, the Memphis Daily Appeal. The grounds were named after Toof&apos;s daughter, Grace, who inherited the farm. Soon after, the portion of the land designated as Graceland today was given to her nephews and niece. It was Grace Toof&apos;s niece, Ruth Moore, who, in 1939 together with her husband Dr. Thomas Moore, built the present American &quot; colonial &quot; style mansion. [ Architecture and modifications ] The mansion is constructed of tan limestone and consists of twenty-three rooms, including eight bedrooms and bathrooms. The entrance way contains four Temple of the Winds columns and two large lions perched on both sides of the portico. After purchasing the property Presley carried out extensive modifications to suit his needs and tastes, including: a fieldstone wall surrounding the grounds, a wrought-iron music-themed gate, a swimming pool, a racquetball court, and the famous &quot; Jungle Room &quot; which features an indoor waterfall, among other modifications. In February and October 1976, the Jungle Room was converted into a recording studio, where Presley recorded the bulk of his final two albums, From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee and Moody Blue; these were his final known recordings in a studio setting. { Ernst Jorgensen, Elvis Presley: A Life in Music - The Complete Recording Sessions (New York: St. Martin&apos;s Press, 1998), pp. 394-402 } One of Presley&apos;s better known modifications was the addition of the Meditation Garden, where he, his parents Gladys and Vernon, and grandmother are buried. A small stone memorializes Elvis&apos; twin brother Jesse Garon who died at birth. The Meditation Garden was opened to the public in 1978. Graceland was officially opened to the public on June 7, 1982. According to critics such as Albert Goldman, &quot; &apos;nothing in the house is worth a dime. &quot; In chapter 1 of his book, Elvis (1981), the author describes Graceland as looking like a brothel: &quot; it appears to have been lifted from some turn-of-the-century bordello down in the French Quarter of New Orleans. &quot; And he dismisses the interior as &quot; gaudy, &quot; &quot; garish &quot; and &quot; phony, &quot; adding that &quot; King Elvis&apos;s obsession with royal red reaches an intensity that makes you gag. &quot; When &quot; people who to a real degree shared Elvis Presley’s class background, and whose lives were formed by his music, &quot; visited the inside of Graceland, Greil Marcus says in similar terms, they &quot; have returned with one word to describe what they saw: &apos;Tacky.&apos; Tacky, garish, tasteless — words others translated as white trash. &quot; { Greil Marcus, Dead Elvis: A Chronicle of a Cultural Obsession (1999), p.71. } In Graceland: Going Home With Elvis, Karal Ann Marling deals with the decorative arts that makes Elvis&apos; mansion seem a creation as well as a site. { See Karal Ann Marling, Graceland: Going Home With Elvis (Harvard University Press, 1996). } Graceland&apos;s &quot; act of faith in serial novelty, &quot; Marling argues, synthesized the &quot; intense concern for personal style &quot; that made B. B. King notice a teenage Elvis in a pawnshop years before he was famous and the fashion sense informing the &quot; theme clothes &quot; of the &apos;70s — &quot; carapace[s] of sheer, radiant glory. &quot; However, during their four year relationship, Presley&apos;s girlfriend Linda Thompson decorated much of Graceland in her own style. { Clutton, Everything Elvis, p. 28 } Even Presley himself was said to &quot; balk at the extent of her red fur and leopard skin look. &quot; Graceland grew from [ 10266 sqft m2 ] when originally bought by Presley to [ 17552 sqft m2 ] today. Managers of the complex announced a major renovation project that will include a new visitors center, a 500-room convention hotel and high-tech museum displays. The current visitors center, souvenir shops, the 128-room Heartbreak Hotel, and museums will be torn down and replaced with the new facilities. The project will take approximately three years to complete [ April 2012 ]. [ Presley at Graceland ] left After Presley began his career he bought a $40,000 home for himself and his family at 1034 Audubon Drive in Memphis. [ Flippo Chet Graceland: Living Legacy of Elvis Presley 1993 Mitchell Beazley 978-1-85732-255-2 29 ] As his fame grew, especially after his appearances on television, the amount of fans that would congregate outside the home multiplied. Presley&apos;s neighbours, most of whom were happy to have a celebrity living nearby, soon came to find the constant gathering of fans and journalists a nuisance. After several complaints, Presley decided it was necessary for him to move to a property more suitable. In early 1957, Presley gave his parents a $100,000 budget, and asked them to find a &quot; farmhouse &quot; type property to purchase. [ Victor Adam The Elvis Encyclopedia 2008 Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co Ltd 978-0-7156-3816-3 205–209 ] At the time, Graceland was located several miles beyond Memphis&apos;s main urban area. In later years Memphis would expand with housing, resulting in Graceland being surrounded by other properties. After Gladys died in 1958, and Vernon married Dee Stanley in 1960, the couple lived there for a time. Wife-to-be Priscilla Beaulieu also lived at Graceland for five years before she and Elvis married. { See Tracy McVeigh, &quot; Love me tender &quot;, } { The Observer, August 11, 2002. } After their marriage in Las Vegas on May 1, 1967, Priscilla lived in Graceland five more years until she separated from Elvis in late 1972. According to Mark Crispin Miller, Graceland became for Elvis &quot; the home of the organization that was himself, was tended by a large vague clan of Presleys and deputy Presleys, each squandering the vast gratuities which Elvis used to keep his whole world smiling. &quot; The author adds that Presley&apos;s father Vernon &quot; had a swimming pool in his bedroom &quot;, that there &quot; was a jukebox next to the swimming pool, containing Elvis&apos; favorite records &quot; and that the singer himself &quot; would spend hours in his bedroom, watching his property on a closed-circuit television. &quot; { Mark Crispin Miller, Boxed in: The Culture of TV (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p.192. } Graceland was Lisa Marie Presley &apos;s first home after her birth on February 1, 1968 and her childhood home, although her main state of residence was California where she lived with her mother after she divorced Elvis when Lisa was in elementary school. Every year at Christmas time Lisa Marie Presley and all her family go to Graceland to celebrate Christmas together. Lisa Marie Presley often goes back to Graceland for visits.When she turned 25, { The Estate of Elvis Presley/The Elvis Presley Trust: EPE History and Structure: All About Elvis } Lisa Marie inherited the estate. In 2005 she sold 85 percent of it. According to Brad Olsen, &quot; Some of the rooms at Graceland testify to the brilliance and quirkiness of Elvis Presley. The TV room in the basement is where he often watched three television sets at once, and was within close reach of a wet bar. &quot; { Brad Olsen, Sacred Places North America: 108 Destinations, p.281. } The Jungle Room, Graceland When he would tour, staying in hotels, &quot; the rooms would be remodelled in advance of his arrival, so as to make the same configurations of space as he had at home – the Graceland mansion. His furniture would arrive, and he could unwind after his performances in surroundings which were completely familiar and comforting, &quot; the room in question, &apos;The Jungle Room&apos; being &quot; an example of particularly lurid kitsch. &quot; { Andrew Ballantyne, &quot; The Nest and the Pillar of Fire. &quot; In What Is Architecture? (2002), p.24. } The Meditation Garden, designed and built by architect Bernard Grenadier, has been noted as a preferred place of Elvis in the property, where he often went to reflect on any problems or situations that arose during his life. According to the singer&apos;s cousin Billy Smith, Elvis spent the night at Graceland with Smith and his wife Jo many times: &quot; we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world! Sometimes he would have a bad dream and come looking for me to talk to, and he would actually fall asleep in our bed with us. &quot; { Billy Smith interview Part Two. &quot; Elvis Information Network. } There was some discord between Elvis and his stepmother Dee at Graceland, however, and Elaine Dundy said &quot; that Vernon had settled down with Dee where Gladys had once reigned, while Dee herself - when Elvis was away - had taken over the role of mistress of Graceland so thoroughly as to rearrange the furniture and replace the very curtains that Gladys had approved of. &quot; This was too much for the singer who still loved his deceased mother. One afternoon, &quot; a van arrived... and all Dee&apos;s household&apos;s goods, clothes, &apos;improvements,&apos; and her own menagerie of pets, were loaded on... while Vernon, Dee and her three children went by car to a nearby house on Hermitage until they finally settled into a house on Dolan Drive which ran alongside Elvis&apos; estate. &quot; { Elaine Dundy, Elvis and Gladys (2004), p.329-330. } The book Elvis by the Presleys reveals several details concerning the singer&apos;s life at Graceland including his obsessions and passions when staying at home. On August 16, 1977, Elvis died in his bathroom at Graceland allegedly of a heart attack. However, there are conflicting reports as to the cause of his death. According to the well known Presley biographer Peter Guralnick, the singer &quot; had thrown up after being stricken, apparently while seated on the toilet. &quot; The author adds that &quot; drug use was heavily implicated in this unanticipated death of a middle-aged man with no known history of heart disease...no one ruled out the possibility of anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist. &quot; { Peter Guralnick, Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley (1999), p.651-652. } [ Graceland Kitchen ] Elvis made lists outlining items to be kept in Graceland at all times. Items included: [ Adler David Life &amp; Cuisine Of Elvis Presley 1993 0-517-88024-5 ] fresh, lean, unfrozen ground meat one case regular Pepsi one case orange drinks rolls (hot rolls - Brown &apos;n&apos; Serve) at least 6 cans of biscuits hamburger buns pickles potatoes and onions assorted fresh fruits cans of sauerkraut wieners at least three bottles each of milk and Half and Half. thin, lean bacon mustard peanut butter fresh, hand-squeezed cold orange juice banana pudding (to be made fresh nightly) ingredients for meat loaf and sauce brownies (to be made fresh nightly) ice cream - vanilla and chocolate shredded coconut fudge cookies 3 packs each of Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit gum cigars (El Producto Diamond Tips &amp; El Producto Altas) cigarettes Dristan Super Anahist Contac Sucrets (antibiotic red box) Feenamint gum matches (four to five books) [ Visits to Graceland ] { Junichiro Koizumi in Graceland } In 1957, Presley invited Richard Williams and Buzz Cason to visit the Whitehaven neighborhood of Memphis where Graceland is located &quot; to get a close look at this mansion Elvis had told us about.... We proceeded to clown around on the front porch, striking our best rock &apos;n&apos; roll poses and snapping pictures with the little camera. We peeked in the not-yet-curtained windows and got a kick out of the pastel colored walls in the front rooms with shades of bright reds and purples that Elvis most certainly had picked out. &quot; { Buzz Cason, Living the Rock &apos;N&apos; Roll Dream: The Adventures of Buzz Cason (2004), p.47. } &quot; In the late 50s, Elvis was fond of claiming that the US government had mooted a visit to Graceland by Nikita Khrushchev, &apos;to see how in America a fellow can start out with nothing and, you know, make good&apos;. { John Harris, &quot; Talking about Graceland &quot;. The Guardian, March 27, 2006. } On June 30, 2006, when US President George W. Bush hosted Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi for a tour of the mansion, it became the only residence on American soil other than an Embassy, the White House, or any of the other Presidential retreats to have hosted a joint-visit by a sitting US president and a head of a foreign government. [ July 2009 ] (Koizumi, who served as Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006, is an avid Elvis Presley fan and even shares Presley&apos;s January 8 birthday.) On August 6, 2010, Prince Albert II, the Principality of Monaco&apos;s Head of State, and his fiancée Charlene Wittstock, on a vacation tour of the United States, also toured Graceland. [ Prince Albert&apos;s Elvis visit http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/royal_family/Prince%2BAlbert-53732.html www.femalefirst.co.uk 7 August 2010 ] Albert explained: &quot; If you&apos;re on a summer holiday, you&apos;ve got to come at this time of year. I&apos;ve always wanted to come to Graceland. Charlene and my friends wanted to be here today for this visit, Elvis touched our lives as well and the lives of so many people. We wanted to pay our respects and see what this place was all about. &quot; [ Tourist destination ] 1st floor, Graceland (not to scale) 2nd floor, Graceland (not to scale) Basement, Graceland (not to scale) After Elvis Presley&apos;s death in 1977, Vernon Presley served as executor of his estate. Upon his death in 1979, he chose Priscilla to serve as the estate executor for Elvis&apos; only child, Lisa Marie who was only 11. Graceland itself cost $500,000 a year in upkeep, and expenses had dwindled Elvis&apos; and Priscilla&apos;s daughter Lisa Marie&apos;s inheritance to only $1 million. Taxes were due on the property, those and other expenses due came to over $500,000. Faced with having to sell Graceland, Priscilla examined other famous houses/museums, and hired a CEO, Jack Soden, to turn Graceland into a moneymaker. Graceland was opened to the public on June 7, 1982. Priscilla&apos;s gamble paid off, after only a month of opening Graceland&apos;s doors the estate made back all the money it had invested. Priscilla Presley became the chairwoman and president of Elvis Presley Enterprises, or EPE, stating at that time she would do so until Lisa Marie reached 21 years of age. The enterprise&apos;s fortunes soared and eventually the trust grew to be worth over $100 million. While Graceland was open to tours from 1982, the last person to live in the house was Elvis&apos; aunt Delta, on Elvis&apos; invitation after her husband died. She died in 1993. { Blanchard, Tamsin (August 11, 2002). Elvis has left the building. } { The Guardian. } An annual procession through the estate and past Elvis&apos; grave is held on the anniversary of his death. The largest gathering assembled on the 25th anniversary in 2002. One estimate was of 40,000 people in attendance, despite the heavy rain. The 20th Anniversary in 1997 had the biggest crowd in Memphis for an Elvis Week. At this time several hundred media groups from around the world were present and the event gained its greatest media publicity as an estimated 50,000 fans visited the city. For many of the hundreds of thousands of people who visit Graceland each year, the visit takes on a quasi-religious perspective. { Davidson, James W.(1985). The pilgrimage to Elvis Presley&apos;s Graceland: A study of the meanings of place (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University } They may plan for years to journey to the home of the ‘King’ of rock and roll. On site, headphones narrate the salient events of Elvis’s life and introduce the relics that adorn the rooms and corridors. The rhetorical mode is hagiographic, celebrating the life of an extraordinary man, emphasizing his generosity, his kindness and good fellowship, how he was at once a poor boy who made good, an extraordinary musical talent, a sinner and substance abuser, and a religious man devoted to the Gospel and its music. At the meditation garden, containing Elvis’s grave, some visitors pray, kneel, or quietly sing one of Elvis’s favorite hymns. The brick wall that encloses the mansion&apos;s grounds is covered with graffiti that express an admiration for the singer as well as petitions for help and thanks for favors granted. { See Linda Kay Davidson and David Gitlitz ‘’Pilgrimage, from the Ganges to Graceland: an Encyclopedia’’ (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2002). } The Graceland grounds include a museum containing many Elvis artifacts, like some of his famous Vegas jumpsuits, awards, gold records, the Lisa Marie jetliner, and Elvis&apos; extensive auto collection. Recently Sirius Satellite Radio installed an all-Elvis Presley channel on the grounds. The service&apos;s subscribers all over North America can hear Presley&apos;s music from Graceland around the clock. Two new attractions have been added, Private Presley and the `68 Special exhibits; these can be found across the street on the plaza. The fieldstone wall that Presley installed is still there, and has several years&apos; worth of graffiti from visitors, who simply refer to it as &quot; the wall &quot;. { Daniel Wright, Dear Elvis: Graffiti from Graceland (1996), p.16. } Tours of the museum s at Graceland are available, though no flash photography or video camera s are allowed inside. There is an audio tour of the Graceland mansion. The upper floor is not open to visitors out of respect for the Presley family and partially to avoid any improper focus on the bathroom which was the site of his death. [ September 2008 ] The upper floor, which also contains Elvis&apos; bedroom, has been untouched since the day Elvis died. Visitors park across the street, boarding shuttle buses to begin the tour of Graceland. Attendants issue headphones, and tourists are individually snapped by a souvenir photographer in front of a painted wall with Graceland&apos;s famous music gates. Tour buses drive across Elvis Presley Blvd. through the smallish Music gates. Down the long winding drive the bus stops in front of stone lions that stand watch at the wide red brick front steps. It was behind these lions that over 3500 of Elvis&apos; mourning fans passed by to see his body in its casket. The house is much bigger than expected, photos being of the main part only. A tour guide stands at the closed doors to give a brief history of Graceland starting with the woman (Grace) it was named for and concluding with the fact that Elvis bought Graceland when he was only 22 years old. Finally the door opens to allow entry through the front door where, almost directly overhead, perhaps forever unseen by the public, is where Elvis died, on his bathroom floor. The Living Room, Graceland &quot; The first shock an Elvis fan experiences upon visiting Graceland is that the mansion is only barely set back from the road &quot; and that through its gates one can see a shopping center. { Marcus, Dead Elvis, p.69. } Upon entering Graceland, the white staircase, filled with reflective mirrors, is directly in front. To the right is the Living Room with the adjoining Music Room, the first room to be presented on the tour. There are guard rails up prohibiting entry to the Living Room and only part of the Music Room can be seen, hidden behind a doorway framed by vivid large peacocks set in stained glass. In this doorway, in front of the stained glass, Elvis&apos; casket was placed for the funeral held in his home. Visible in the Music Room is a black baby grand piano and an old 1950s style TV. The Living Room contains a [ 15 ft m mid -long ] white sofa against the wall overlooking Graceland&apos;s front yard. To the left is a white fireplace. The painting that was Elvis&apos; last Christmas present from his father, Vernon, hangs in this room. Also displayed are photographs of Elvis&apos; parents Vernon and Gladys, Elvis and Lisa Marie. These rooms are then followed with a walk past the grand staircase to Elvis&apos; parents&apos; room. In Elvis&apos; parents&apos; bedroom, white is the predominant color. A velvet-looking dark purple bedspread drapes onto the floor at the foot of the queen size bed. The walls, dresser, bed and carpet are bright white, protected from visitors by a guard rail. To the right is the closet, sealed with clear glass showing four or five of the dresses Gladys wore. To the left is a pink full bathroom, almost obscured from sight because of a velvet rope barrier. Elvis&apos; Lockheed Jetstar on display near Graceland. Next, the tour takes you into the dining room and the kitchen (which was not open to the public until 1995, as Elvis&apos; aunt Delta used it until her death in 1993) { Moore, June (November 6, 1998). &quot; Graceland Mansion &quot;. } and continues through the basement, where Elvis&apos; media room with its three televisions can be seen. There is also a bar and billiards room. The tour continues upstairs again, through the famous Jungle Room. After the Jungle room, it exits to the backyard, past Lisa Marie&apos;s childhood swing set, to a small white building that served as his father&apos;s office. Through the office there is a small room containing a scale model of the home where he was born in Tupelo, Mississippi. Elvis&apos; shooting range is housed in what used to be an old smokehouse. Down the sloping lawn, past horses grazing behind neat white fences, visitors enter the &quot; Trophy Room &quot;. Originally this space was a sidewalk behind the house that Elvis had enclosed to store his many items of appreciation. Just inside is Elvis&apos; famous gold lamé suit from his early years. In the Trophy Room many walls display records, movie posters, old time memorabilia of lipstick and shoes, even a 1950s Elvis doll. Among items there are the three Grammys Elvis won, Priscilla&apos;s wedding dress, Elvis&apos; wedding tuxedo, Lisa Marie&apos;s toy chest and baby clothes and the famous hall of Elvis&apos; gold records and awards. The Trophy Room then winds down the halls through a display of his 68 Comeback, featuring his leather suit, his personal copies of his movie scripts, costumes he wore in many of his movies and a few of his trademark jumpsuits. Also in this room are all the awards and distinctions Elvis received and a display of the many canceled checks Elvis wrote to various charities. { Elvis Presley &apos;s Convair 880, &quot; Lisa Marie &quot;, named after } { his daughter } Once again outside, the tour moves past his still fully functioning stable of horses. Elvis&apos; Racquetball Court is next, now housing a display of Elvis&apos; sequined &quot; jumpsuits &quot;. The entrance is reminiscent of entering an old country club, expertly built and expensively furnished in dark leather on the numerous bar chairs and sofas. A fully functional bar is on the right. To the left is a sunken sitting area with the ever present stereo system found throughout Graceland. There is also the dark brown upright piano upon which Elvis played for what were to be his last songs, Willie Nelson &apos;s Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain and The Righteous Brothers&apos; &quot; Unchained Melody &quot;. Reports conflict about which one was the last song. The sitting area has a floor to ceiling shatter proof window designed to watch the many racquetball games that took place here when Elvis was alive. In the early hours of the morning Elvis died he, his girlfriend Ginger Alden, his first cousin Billy Smith and Billy&apos;s wife Jo played a game of racquetball ending the game with the song on the piano before Elvis walked into the main house to wash his hair and go to bed. Today the court has been converted into displays of the majority of Elvis&apos; stage costumes. More costumes are on display across the street in the &quot; Sincerely Elvis &quot; area. Many old vinyl records are hanging in the two story court, including numerous posthumous awards. Big screen TVs are scattered throughout Graceland. In the racquetball court Elvis&apos; movies and recordings of his Las Vegas concerts play continually. Elvis had the swimming pool built after moving to Graceland. Just past the pool area is the Meditation Garden where Elvis, his mother Gladys, his father Vernon and grandmother Minnie Mae Hood Presley lie buried. A separate building across the street houses a car collection, which includes Elvis&apos; Pink Cadillac and not far away his two planes Lisa Marie (a Convair 880 ) and Hound Dog II (a Lockheed JetStar ) are on display.

She kept the Graceland property itself, as well as the bulk of the possessions found therein, and she turned over the management of Graceland to CKX, Inc., an entertainment company (on whose board of directors Priscilla Presley sits) that also owns 19 Entertainment, creator of the American Idol TV show. left In February 2006, CKX Chairman Bob Sillerman announced plans to turn Graceland into an international tourist destination on a par with the Disney or Universal theme parks, sprucing up the area mansion and doubling or possibly tripling the 600,000 annual visitors to around 2 million a year. Sillerman’s goal is to enhance the &quot; total fan experience &quot; at Graceland to compel visitors to spend more time and money. The company is working with the Bob Weis, the recently named new CEO of Disney Imagineering based in Orlando, Florida, to improve the tourist area around Graceland, which is located in an economically depressed area of Memphis, while keeping intact the historic home. Graceland officials envision a [ 3 mi km on ] strip of Elvis Presley Boulevard transformed into a beautiful entertainment district from East Brooks RD all the way down to East Shelby Drive. EPE has bought up over [ 120 acre km2 ] of land both commercial and residential around the mansion both north and south, everything from apartment complexes, car dealership, a souvenir shop and even some houses in the area to make way for the expansion. Sillerman, who has been speaking with investors and developers, plans to spend between $250 million to $500 million on redeveloping the area surrounding Graceland. Among his plans are a new luxury hotel of more than 500 rooms and a convention center, an amphitheater for live concerts, restaurants and retail, plus a new [ 80000 sqft m2 on ] visitor&apos;s center and museum adjacent to the Graceland mansion. 2009 was set as the target date to begin work on the project but first it has to be approved by the Memphis City Council. While visitor numbers grew to around 700,000, by 2005, and partly due to the negative impact on US tourism of 9/11, visitor numbers at Graceland had reportedly declined to around 600,000 due to the rough neighborhood it surrounds. [ In pop culture ] The title of Paul Simon &apos;s album Graceland and the title track was inspired by Elvis&apos; home. The title song, which presents Graceland as a holy place, also won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year a year later. The song &quot; Walking in Memphis &quot; by Marc Cohn and later Cher features Graceland prominently. The film 3000 Miles to Graceland is about a group of criminals who plan to rob a casino during an international Elvis week, and to make it easier, they are all disguised as Elvis impersonators. There is a movie Finding Graceland starring Harvey Keitel with Johnathon Schaech, as Kietel being a impersonator who claims to be the actual real Elvis after Schaech picks him up as a hitch-hiker trying to get a ride to Memphis.
