The Mystic coal seam was just over 2 feet thick here, reached by a 202 foot shaft. Numa Block Mine number 3, the Sunshine Mine, was in the southeast part of town, served by the Rock Island, with a 240 foot shaft to the Mystic seam. { Henry Hinds, The Coal Deposits of Iowa, Annual Report, 1908, Iowa Geological Survey, 1909, page 260. } In 1884, Local Assembly 3143 of the Knights of Labor, based in Seymour, had 40 members. { Part III, Labor Organizations: Knights of Labor, First Biennial Report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the State of Iowa, Geo.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 2.4 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. [ Transportation ] [ June 2008 ] Seymour is served by a county-maintained road which used to be Iowa Highway 55 and is now County Road S60. Seymour is served by the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad (IC &amp; E) which currently operates the former Milwaukee Railroad tracks. Seymour was also served by the CRI &amp; P (Rock Island) until the early 1980s. This line passed on the southwest corner of the town square with the depot in this location. This line was abandoned when the Rock Island went bankrupt. It used to be part of the Golden State Route which was a luxury passenger train operated by the Rock Island and the Southern Pacific. The two railroad lines crossed at the western edge of Seymour and was protected by an interlocking tower until the Rock Island was abandoned. There had been talk of relaying the track from Allerton to Seymour on the old Rock Island right of way to provide a connection between the IC &amp; E and the Union Pacific. This idea has since been dropped due to the objections of the adjacent landowners.
