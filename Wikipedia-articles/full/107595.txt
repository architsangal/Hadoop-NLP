As of the 2010 census, the population was 83,089. The city&apos;s ZIP code s are 91801 and 91803 (plus 91802 for P.O. boxes). [ History ] Alhambra is named after Washington Irving &apos;s book Tales of the Alhambra, not after the Alhambra palace itself. { City of Alhambra } Alhambra was founded as a suburb of Los Angeles in 1903. Alhambra existed as an unincorporated area during the mid-19th century. The first school in Alhambra was Ramona Convent Secondary School built on hillside property donated by the prominent James de Barth Shorb family. Thirteen years before the city was incorporated, several prominent San Gabriel Valley families interested in the Catholic education of their daughters established the school in 1890. The city&apos;s first public high school, Alhambra High School, was established in 1898, five years before the city&apos;s incorporation. The Alhambra Fire Department was established in 1906. On July 11, 1903, the City of Alhambra was incorporated. Alhambra was originally promoted as a &quot; city of homes, &quot; and many of Alhambra&apos;s homes have historical significance. They include styles such as Craftsman, Bungalow, Spanish Mediterranean, Spanish Colonial, Italian Beaux-Arts, and Arts &amp; Crafts. Several residential areas have been designated as Historic Neighborhoods by the city, including the Bean Tract (formerly owned by early resident Jacob Bean), the Midwick Tract (site of the former Midwick Country Club ), the Airport Tract (formerly the landing pad for Alhambra Airport), and the Emery Park area. { City of Alhambra:Residential living } There are also a large number of condominiums, rental apartments, and mixed-use residential/commercial buildings, especially in the Downtown area. Downtown Alhambra, Garfield and Main, 1890 The main business district of Alhambra — at the intersection of Main &amp; Garfield — has been a center of commerce since 1895. By the 1950s, it had taken on an upscale look and was &quot; the &quot; place to go in the San Gabriel Valley. While unfortunately, many of the classic historical buildings have been torn down over the years, the rebuilding of Main Street has led to numerous dining, retail and entertainment establishments. Alhambra has experienced waves of new immigrants, beginning with Italians in the 1950s, Mexicans in the 1960s, and Chinese in the 1980s. As a result, a very active Chinese business district has developed on Valley Boulevard, including Chinese supermarkets, restaurants, shops, banks, realtors, and medical offices. The Valley Boulevard Corridor has become a national hub for many Asian-owned bank headquarters, although there are other nationally-recognized retailers. The historic Garfield Theatre, on Valley Blvd and Garfield Avenue 1925-2001, was formerly a Vaudeville venue and is rumored to have hosted the Gumm Sisters, featuring a very young Judy Garland. Faded from its original glory, for its last few years it was purchased and ran Chinese-language films, but in 2001 went out of business. Subsequently, developers have remodeled the dilapidated building turning it into a vibrant commercial center with many Chinese stores and eateries. In 2003, actress Lana Clarkson was shot to death in the Alhambra home of record producer Phil Spector. Spector lived in Alhambra&apos;s largest and most notable residence, the Pyrenees Castle, built in 1926. { The Guardian, March 17, 2007 } In 2009, Spector was convicted of second-degree murder in connection with her death. { Reuters, April 13, 2009 } [ Geography ] Alhambra is bordered by South Pasadena on the northwest, San Marino on the north, San Gabriel on the east, Monterey Park on the south, and the Los Angeles districts of Monterey Hills and El Sereno on the west. { Regional location map } According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 7.6 sqmi km2 ], over 99% of which is land.
