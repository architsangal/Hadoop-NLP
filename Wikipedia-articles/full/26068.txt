You thrust upon my flesh and soul, like tempests upon ships do thrust. I do not want, at all, to know, what will befall to me the next – would I be smashed against my woe, or thrown into happiness. In awe and gaiety elated, like a ship, that’s going tempests through, I am not sorry that I’ve met you, and not afraid to love you, too.&apos;&apos; ( Translation by Yevgeny Bonver ) 100px Anna Akhmatova (1889–1966) Evening Requiem The Rosary Poem Without a Hero &quot; Like a White Stone &quot; Like a white stone deep in a draw-well lying, As hard and clear, a memory lies in me. I cannot strive nor have I heart for striving: It is such pain and yet such ecstasy. It seems to me that someone looking closely Into my eyes would see it, patent, pale. And, seeing, would grow sadder and more thoughtful Than one who listens to a bitter tale. The ancient gods changed men to things, but left them A consciousness that smoldered endlessly, That splendid sorrows might endure forever. And you are changed into a memory.

Hate, be a faithful prop, and find The words most biting and most fit, So that filth brings no vertigo To him who bends so close to it; So that the honest artist spurns The facile phrase, the weak excuse, And is the first one to detect The coward&apos;s lie, the traitor&apos;s truce; So that the artist may be schooled In probing, judging, and may sense Just what a deposition means And learn the tongue of evidence; So that he trains his eye to catch A wolfish trick, and warns us all If silently the enemy Slips past, or waits and hugs the wall, Or if, again, with zealous mien And upraised fist the foe votes &quot; Aye &quot; Not caught red-handed yet, not known And named as one who lives a lie; Until our enemy must run From verse as one who on the stair Hears the police, then drops in dread And cannot cover his despair. 100px Aleksey Apukhtin (1840–1893) Eduard Asadov (1923–2004) 100px Nikolay Aseyev (1889–1963) Zor Night Flute Lera Auerbach (born 1973) Gennadiy Aygi (1934–2006) [ yes yes yes ] [ B ] Portrait Person Notable works Sample 100px Eduard Bagritsky (1895–1934) February 100px Konstantin Balmont (1867–1942) Under the Northern Sky Let&apos;s Be as the Sun Centuries of Centuries Will Pass Long centuries of centuries will pass, unsighted Milleniums as locusts in deathy clouds descend, And in the muttering of centuries affrighted The same enduring firmament will watch the end. The dumb, dead firmament that God will not remember, Who breathes Eternity behind the farther skies, Beyond the fading of the last star&apos;s last slow ember, Beyond the utter threshold words may scrutinize. Forever cold, that starry desert, clouds out-topping, Is flung forth, alien to the end, on space, When tearing comet-fires will crumble with it, dropping As dumbly burning tears from a despairing face. 100px Jurgis Baltrušaitis (1873–1944) The Pendulum When tne dumb darkness most heavily clings, Rhythmic and ruthless my pendulum swings. Rustily creaking or whining dismay, Urging each tarrying moment away. Longing, it seems, for the days that are fled, Down ancient stairways resounds someone&apos;s tread. Heavy the footfall on flagstones unlit, Lower and lower and down to the pit. Praying, it seems, for a long-vanished shore, Dumbly the Helmsman with slow stubborn oar Brokenly rows me, morosely alone, Into my harbor, afar and unknown. Evil the Ferryman, darkly he pounds; Farther and farther, more muffled resounds, Hostile and hopeless, the long downward climb: Cold, ineluctable footsteps of Time. 100px Evgeny Baratynsky (1800–1844) Eda The Gypsy The Last Poet Autumn Be Mirthful Now Be mirthful now, for nothing stays, Our good and evil both are brief. Capricious Fate leads many ways, Sometimes to joy, sometimes to grief, And is no friend to constancy. Listen, you whose lives are bright, For the uncertain hours be Winged for flight. Do not repine, since nothing stays; What matter if it chance at last That unexpectedly our days By cruel sorrow are o&apos;ercast? Upon this changeful earth of ours, The gods from pain took half its stings When alike to all the hours They gave wings. 100px Ivan Barkov (1732–1768) Luka Mudischev Anna Barkova (1901–1976) Tatar Anguish Agniya Barto (1906–1981) Toys Mishka the Petty Thief 100px Alexander Bashlachev (1960–1988) 100px Konstantin Batyushkov (1787–1855) 100px Demyan Bedny (1883–1945) No One Knew (April 22, 1870) It was a day like any other, The same dull sky, the same drab street. There was the usual angry pother From the policeman on his beat. Proud of his fine new miter&apos;s luster, The archpriest strutted down the nave; And the pub rocked with brawl and bluster, Where scamps gulped down what fortune gave. The market women buzzed and bickered Like flies above the honeypots. The burghers&apos; wives bustled and dickered, Eyeing the drapers&apos; latest lots. An awe-struck peasant stared and stuttered, Regarding an official door Where yellow rags of paper fluttered: A dead ukase of months before. The fireman ranged his tower, surveying The roofs, like the chained bears one sees; And soldiers shouldered arms, obeying The drill sergeant&apos;s obscenities. Slow carts in caravans went winding Dockward, where floury stevedores moiled; And, under convoy, in the blinding Dust of the road, a student toiled, And won some pity, thus forlorn, From the drunk hand who poured his scorn In curses on some pal and brother.... Russia was aching with the thorn And bearing her old cross, poor mother. That day, a day like any other, And not a soul knew that Lenin was born! 100px Andrey Bely (1880–1934) Urn Gold in Azure Christ Has Risen The First Encounter Euthanasia The shining and ponderous goblet I empty: the earth drops below me, All things sink away, I am treading Cold space the vast void the dim ether. But distant, in ancient space looming, My glimmering goblet: the Sun. I look far below me are lying The rivers, the forests, the valleys, Estranged in the vanishing distance. A cloud, blowing fog on my eyelids, Trails gossamer gold in its going. The flickering landscape is burning Its last: mid-day stars newly-kindled Look into my soul, sparkling: &quot; Welcome, &quot; With radiance silently streaming: &quot; The end of long wanderings, brother, Lies here, in your motherland, welcome! &quot; Slow hour upon hour in procession, Slow centuries, smiling, pass onward.

On the mail the sabre knelling, Gallop, steed! for far thy dwelling, See! they fall, but distant still Is the forest of the hill! &quot; Russian shot our hearts is rending, Falls the Mullah on his knee, To the Lord of Light bows he, To the Prophet he is bending; Like a shaft his prayer ascending, Upward flies to Allah&apos;s throne Il-Allah! Oh, save thine own! &quot; Ah, despair! What crash like thunder! Lo! a sign from heaven above! Lo! the forest seems to move, Crashes, murmurs, bursts asunder! Lower, nearer, wonder! wonder!

Small the echo that thou throwest, Far, I hear thy footfalls die. Art thou near? too far for greeting? Lost in topless altitudes? Shall I wait a sudden meeting Where sonorous stillness broods? In the solitude resounding Distant footsteps echo free. Is it thou who flamest, bounding Circles of infinity?

Virgin vistas reared, lit with quivering red, And beyond seas were the trackless wanderers fled. But on the pillars of marble, on the threshold were thrown Crimson shadows incredible, sunk in the stone. And, under the arch, in eternity&apos;s radiance hidden, Angels exulted in fruits that are secret and sweet and forbidden. 100px Ivan Bunin (1870–1953) In An Empty House From the walls the paper&apos;s blue is vanished, The daguerreotypes, the ikons banished. Only there the deepened blue appears Where these hid it, hanging through the years. From the heart the memory is perished, Perished all that long ago it cherished! Those remain, of whom death hides the face, Leaving their yet unforgotten trace. 100px Anna Bunina (1774–1829) [ yes yes yes ] [ C ] Portrait Person Notable works Sample 100px Sasha Chorny (1880–1932) 100px Korney Chukovsky (1882–1969) Aybolit Wash&apos;em&apos;clean The Crocodile The Giant Roach 100px Georgy Chulkov (1879–1939) Purple Autumn Purple Autumn unloosened her tresses and flung them On the heavens and over the dew-heavy fields. She came as a guest to the old, silent house, Singeing the grasses with red; Through the garden she moved,- Up the balcony; scarcely she touched The fragile old rails. She pushed the door-panel softly, Softly she entered the room, Sprinkling the rugs with her sun-yellow dust, Dropped a red leaf upon the piano... Ever after that hour, we heard her unceasing, her tireless rustling, Rustle and stir and soft whisper. And our hands suddenly metWith no new words, new and forever false. As though we had hung a wreath of red roses On a black, wrought-iron door Leading into a vault Where lay the rotting body Of a beloved dream. Autumnal days were upon us, Days of inscrutable longing; We were treading the stairs Of autumnal passion. In my heart a wound, Like the lamp of an ikon, Burned and would not be quenched. The cup of autumnal poison We pressed to our lips. By the serpentine garden path Autumn had led us To crepuscular lilies Upon the pale, sand-humbled pond. And over the lilied waters and in the roses of evening, We loved, more superstitiously. And through the dark night, On the languorous bed, At the feet of my love, I loved death anew. The minutes rang tinkling like crystals At the brink of an autumn grave: Autumn and Death drunkenly clinked their glasses. I pressed my thirsty lips To the feet the ikon-lamp burnished, I drank the cup of love. Burned by the fires of sins, Stretched on the cross of lusts, Shamed, being needlessly faithless, I drank the cup of love. In the hour of ineffable dalliance I sensed the whisper Of autumn pain, of autumn passion. And kisses like keen needles Burned and pierced, Weaving a wreath of thorns.

Why from early evening tide Even to the midnight late Twinkle not your little stars, Shineth not your full-orbed moon? You are veiled with darkling clouds! &apos;T is with you, I think, O night, Even as with me, young man, Villain grief has called on us! When the dire one takes abode Somewhere deep within the heart, You forget the lasses fair, Dances and obeisances; You forget from evening tide Even to the midnight late, Singing songs, to take delight In the chorus and the dance. No, you sob, you weep aloud, And, a sad and lonely lad, You upon your coarse straw bed Throw yourself as in the grave! Andrey Dementyev (born 1928) Regina Derieva (born 1949) 100px Gavrila Derzhavin (1743–1816) The Stream of Time The stream of time, with onward sweep, Bears off men&apos;s works, all human things, And plunges o&apos;er Oblivion&apos;s steep Peoples and kingdoms with their kings. If for a space amidst the swirl The lyre or trumpet some sustain, They&apos;re swept at last in ceaseless whirl, And none escape Fate&apos;s common main. 100px Ivan Dmitriev (1760–1837) The Little Dove The little dove, with heart of sadness, In silent pain sighs night and day; What now can wake that heart to gladness? His mate beloved is far away. He coos no more with soft caresses, No more is millet sought by him, The dove his lonesome state distresses, And tears his swimming eyeballs dim. From twig to twig now skips the lover, Filling the grove with accents kind, On all sides roams the harmless rover, Hoping his little friend to find. Ah! vain that hope his grief is tasting, Fate seems to scorn his faithful love. And imperceptibly is wasting, Wasting away, the little dove! At length upon the grass he threw him, Hid in his wing his beak and wept; There ceased his sorrows to pursue him, The little dove for ever slept. His mate, now sad abroad and grieving, Flies from a distant home again. Sits by her friend, with bosom heaving, And bids him wake with sorrowing pain. She sighs, she weeps, her spirits languish. Around and round the spot she goes; Ah! charming Chloe &apos;slost in anguish, Her friend wakes not from his repose! 100px Nikolay Dobrolyubov (1836–1861) Death’s Jest Songs of Russia, Alice Blackwell, Published by the Author, Chicago, 1906. What if I die? ‘Twere little grief! But one fear wrings my breast- Perhaps Death, too, may play on me A grim, insulting jest. I fear that over my cold corpse Hot tears may fall in showers; That someone, with a foolish zeal, May heap my bier with flowers; That friends may crowd behind my hearse With thoughts of grief sincere, And when I lie beneath the mould, Men’s hearts may hold me dear; That all which I so eagerly And vainly used to crave In life, may brightly smile on me When I am in my grave!

I cast wide nets and tentative In lakes of sorrow. I go toward final tenderness By pathways sordid. I look for dewdrops glistering In falsehood&apos;s gardens. I save truth&apos;s globules glistening, From dust-heaps garnered. I fain would fathom fortitude Through years of wormwood And pierce the mortal fortalice, Yet live, a worldling.

Many are thine ancient churches Towering like the northern pine; Where can eye see streets so noble, Mother Moscow, as are thine? Capture Moscow&apos;s mighty Kremlin? Who on earth would boast the power? Who could rob the golden bonnet From the slender Ivan tower? Who could ever swing the Tsar-bell, Or the Tsar-gun overthrow? Reverence at the sacred gateway Who could ever fail to show? In thine awful hour of peril, When thy haughty neck was bent, All thy children, men of Russia, Felt with thee the punishment. White-walled city, them wast chastened Like a martyr in the fire; And thy river, boiling, hastened Onward to escape the pyre. Once a captive and dishonoured, In thine embers thou didst lie!

And, dearest, how should I not weep? Nor dolorous grief o&apos;er me prevail? Where strength and calm endurance draw To choke... a mother&apos;s wail? In offering to our native land We needs must of our own will part With what is lovelier than life. E&apos;en though it break our heart. And so I freely offer thee To deadly battle with the foe.

Upon such languid evenings you will see Coachmen whip up their horses savagely, And fishers tear the waters with the oar, And woodsmen batter at the oaks they floor... While those who in their being must rehearse The movement of the throbbing universe, Who house within them, slumbering or astir, Rhythms to come and all that ever were, Write winged verses whose resistless sweep Rouses the sluggard elements from sleep. 100px Elena Guro (1877–1913) [ yes yes yes ] [ I ] Portrait Person Notable works Sample 100px Vera Inber (1890–1972) Mikhail Isakovsky (1900–1973) Georgy Ivanov (1894–1958) 100px Vyacheslav Ivanov (1866–1949) Complaint Your soul, born deaf and blind, inhabits Jungles of sunless reverie, Where with the crash of trampled saplings Wild droves of dark desires roam free.

Heaven help the state—for lo! the bench of asses The bench of elephants by far surpasses. He was a fool, the foresaid king, you&apos;ll say: Better have kept those places vacant surely, Than fill them up so poorly. O no! that&apos;s not the royal way; Things have been done for ages thus,— and we Have a deep reverence for antiquity: Naught worse, sir, than to be, or to appear Wiser and better than our fathers were. The list must be complete, even though you make it Complete with asses; for the lion saw Such had for ages been the law,— He was no radical to break it! &quot; Besides, &quot; he said, &quot; my elephants&apos; good sense Will soon my asses&apos; ignorance diminish, For wisdom has a mighty influence. &quot; They made a pretty finish!

But though they pulled with all their might, That cart-load on the bank stuck tight.

On either side the long, broad street The peasants&apos; cottages are seen; The solitary watchman&apos;s feet Are heard, as he moves on between. Cold is he now; the hollow gale Fills with violent blast the air; The frost has touched his visage pale, And whitened all his beard and hair. Joy has fled from his gloomy brow, He finds it hard to be alone; Through the dark night, and blinding snow, His song resounds with mournful tone. By moonless nights he paces late, Watching until the morn comes round; His hammer upon the iron plate Gives out a dreary, dismal sound.
