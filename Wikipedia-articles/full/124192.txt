The town had lobbied Letterman for the status for months. It had the Nebraska legislature proclaim him an admiral in the Great Navy of the State of Nebraska, as well as inundate Letterman with letters, postcards, and bribes of flowers, clothing, animals, alcoholic beverages, shredded money, and free checkups at the Wahoo Medical Center. When Letterman jokingly said he wanted more, Wahoo sent him a &apos;76 Ford Pinto with a sofa attached to the hood, a wall clock made of cow droppings, and two of the town&apos;s teenagers, brothers Jeff and Josh Price. This brought some degree of fame and tourism to the town. The nightly recap of the show on the CBS web site is titled The Wahoo Gazette. Wahoo Public High School is the owner of the third-longest boys&apos; high school basketball winning streak — 114 straight games — from 1987-88 through the 1991-92 seasons, winning four state championships.
