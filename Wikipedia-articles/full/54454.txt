Putnam County formed in 1812, when it detached from Dutchess County. [ 2010 ], the population was 99,710. It is part of the New York Metropolitan Area. The county seat is the hamlet of Carmel.

It is one of the most affluent counties in America, ranked 11th by median household income, and 47th by per-capita income, according to the 2000 census. [ History ] When New York Colony established its twelve counties in 1683, the present Putnam County was part of Dutchess County. Dutchess County also included two towns in the present Columbia County. Until 1713, Dutchess County was administered by Ulster County. [ Putnamcountyny Putnam County history 2007 Putnamcountyny 2008-01-13 http://www.putnamcountyny.com/historian/aboutpc.htm#0 http://web.archive.org/web/20080316122830/http%3A//www.putnamcountyny.com/historian/aboutpc.htm#0 2008-03-16 ] In 1609, a group of Native Americans called the Wappinger s inhabited the east bank of the Hudson River. They cultivated, hunted, and fished for shellfish in the rich land of the Hudson Valley. They often encountered Dutch traders, from which they obtained goods such as alcohol and firearms. [ Mahopac Library History of the native Americans in Putnam County 2008 2008-01-29 http://www.mahopaclibrary.org/localhistory/addendum.htm ] In 1691, a group of Dutch traders purchased an area of land that is now known as Putnam County from the Wappingers. Six years later the traders sold it to wealthy Dutch-American merchant Adolph Philipse, who then obtained a royal patent for land extending all the way from the Hudson to the Connecticut border —an area to be known as the Philipse Patent. { Putnam County Online: Historian } In 1737, the Colonial Assembly designated the Philipse Patent as the South Precinct of Dutchess County, and the Philipses began leasing farms to immigrants from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Long Island and lower Westchester. After Adolph Philipse&apos;s death, the Patent was divided in 1754 into nine lots granted to three heirs: Mary Philipse, Philip Philipse, and Susannah Philipse Robinson. During the French and Indian War, many of the Wappingers went to Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Putnam was slow to be settled compared to other parts of the Hudson Valley, for two reasons. Firstly, it was privately owned and settlement was limited to tenent farmers willing to pay a portion of their earnings to Phillipse. Secondly, it was mostly hilly and rocky and unattractive to farmers looking for tillable cropland, and therefore was limited to dairy farming and wood cutting. The first non-tenent settlers in the county were along its eastern edge, due to an ambiguous border with Connecticut, which attracted farmers from New England, who presumed that the disputed area was not owned by Phillipse. The problem with the Connecticut border is that the colony of New York claimed roughly 20 miles east of the Hudson River, but the river veers slightly to the west in the Highlands. Thus, the eastern roughly 2 miles of the county (and parts of Dutchess and Westchester counties) were in &quot; The Oblong &quot;, the narrow band thought by some to be in Connecticut. { http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyputnam/history/chapVIII/index.htm } An early settler was the Hayt family, which built a farm called The Elm in 1720. { http://www.historicpatterson.org/Exhibits/ExhMiscellaneous.php } Jacob Haviland settled in the Oblong in 1731 in what became known as Haviland Hollow. { http://www.historicpatterson.org/Exhibits/ExhHavilandHollow.php } The first village in the county was Fredericksburg, now the hamlet of Patterson. { 1765 map of Putnam County at http://www.hyzercreek.com/1765map.JPG } The border dispute was solved after the Revolution, and the heavily settled oblong was incorporated as the first of two versions of the Town of Southeast, named thus as it was the southeasternmost town in Dutchess County. Another early part of the county to be settled was &quot; The Gore &quot;, which was the ambiguous northern border of the Phillipse patent, between it and the Livingston and Beekman patents now in Dutchess County. Thus, the settlement known as Ludingtonville came about without the consent of the Phillipse family. { Pellitreau, history of Putnam County p. 87 } Due to the increasing population of Dutchess County and the great distance from its county seat, Poughkeepsie, Putnam detached from Dutchess in 1812, and created its own county. [ GenWeb Putnam County 2006 Rootsweb 2008-01-27 http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyputnam/ ] Putnam was also able to function as a separate county because of the easy transportation provided by the Hudson River. Boats transporting goods traveled up the Hudson to ports, mainly at Peekskill, where it was brought out Peekskill Hollow Rd. into Putnam County, or goods were unloaded in Putnam County itself at Cold Spring. Problems arose when the river froze in the winter, which resulted in little food or goods being brought to the county. The Philipstown Turnpike was created in 1815 as a toll road from Cold Spring to Connecticut. The wagons that traveled the road would transport produce from eastern Putnam County and iron ore from the mines. The route of the turnpike can roughly be traced today: Rt 301 from Cold Spring to Farmers Mills Road, to White Pond Road to Pecksville, then Holmes Rd to Patterson, then Quaker Hill Rd to Connecticut. Transportation improved again with the advent of the railroad, namely the Harlem Line, which was built in the 1840s, connecting Putnam by rail to New York City. There were originally four stations on the Harlem line in Putnam County: Brewster, Dykemans, Towners, and Patterson. Today only the Brewster and Patterson stops remain, with a new one added in modern times called Southeast. Putnam County played an important role in the Civil War. One third of the county&apos;s men between the ages of 15 and 55 served in the military at the time of the war. During the post-Civil War years, industry and agriculture suffered losses. Iron, which was produced in the Highland Mountains, could be found elsewhere. Agriculture was also affected greatly. The increasing need for drinking water in New York City led the city to search the Hudson Valley for water. In Putnam County, much of the farmland were flooded to create reservoirs. The abandoning of farms, the creation of reservoirs, and the preservation of the remaining open land resulted in scenic lands that drew large amounts of tourism from New York City. By the 20th century, improved roads brought vacationers from New York City, which led to creation of the Taconic State Parkway during the Great Depression. This brought more vacationers, which were attracted to the scenic land and the inexpensive hotels, inns, and summer houses. Putnam County&apos;s population doubled during the summer months. After World War II, Putnam County became an exurb of New York City. Rapid development occurred as Putnam County became a bedroom community. However, the protection of Putnam county&apos;s reservoirs inherently limited development, as much of the land in the county is close to wetlands or reservoirs. Since World War II, the county has seen the development of the Taconic State Parkway as well as several state routes. The county has also seen three county executives; David D. Bruen 1979-1986, Peter C. Alexanderson, 1987–1990 and Robert J. Bondi, 1991–present.

[ County Courts ] There are three types of general trial courts in Putnam County: the New York Supreme Court, the County Court and the Justice Courts. The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the New York State Unified Court System, which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest court of appeals in the federal system as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Putnam hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over criminal cases in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Putnam however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases. [ New York State united court system Courts in Putnam county 2007 New York State united court system 2008-01-13 http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/9jd/Putnam/supremecounty.shtml ] The County Court is authorized to hear all criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles felony cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on misdemeanor cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court&apos;s jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000. The Historic Putnam County Courthouse is located in the town of Carmel. Built in 1814 in Greek Revival style, it is the second oldest working courthouse in New York State, second to the one in Johnstown. Portico and pillars were added to the structure in the 1840s. It was recently extensively remodeled to preserve the structure and adapt it for use as the Surrogate&apos;s Court. { Putnam County Visitors&apos; Bureau } The New Putnam County Courthouse opened on January 2, 2008.

In 2008 John McCain won the county by a narrower majority of 54.4% to Barack Obama&apos;s 44.7%., { New York Times Electoral Map } for a Cook PVI of R+6. Since 1892, Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and Lyndon Johnson in 1964 have been the only Democrats to carry Putnam County at the Presidential Level. { David Leip&apos;s Presidential Atlas (Historical election maps for New York) } In 2004, however, it was won by Senator Chuck Schumer over Howard Mills (in a landslide re-election that left Howard Mills winning only one county statewide) by a landslide margin of 58% to 35%, or 23 percentage points. In 2006 it was won by Eliot Spitzer over John Faso by a margin of 58% to 39% as Spitzer won a landslide victory and Faso carried only 4 counties. Senator Hillary Clinton also won Putnam County in 2006 by a much smaller margin over John Spencer of 51% to 45%. In 2010 Andrew Cuomo won Putnam County over Republican Carl Paladino 51% to 44%.
