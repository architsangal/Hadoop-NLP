[ the 1994 film the play by Alan Bennett The Madness of George III the 2004 political satire The Madness of King George (book) ] [ y 1994 12 28 United States 1995 3 24 United Kingdom ] { 107 minutes } { English } The Madness of King George is a 1994 film directed by Nicholas Hytner and adapted by Alan Bennett from his own play, The Madness of George III. It tells the true story of George III &apos;s deteriorating mental health, and his equally declining relationship with his son, the Prince of Wales, particularly focusing on the period around the Regency Crisis of 1788. Modern medicine has suggested the King&apos;s symptoms were the result of acute intermittent porphyria. [ Plot ] The film depicts the relatively primitive medical practices of the time and the suppositions that physicians made in their efforts to understand the human body. After King George III begins to go mad, his doctors attempt cures such as blistering and purges, led on particularly by the Prince of Wales&apos; personal physician, Dr Warren. Meanwhile, another of the King&apos;s physicians, Dr. Pepys, analyzes the King&apos;s stool and urine believing that body wastes may contain some clue to the Royal malady; of course, none of these attempts to cure the King actually works. Finally, Lady Pembroke, attendant to the Queen, recommends Dr. Willis, an ex-minister who attempts to cure the insane through behavior modification, and who begins his restoration of the King&apos;s mental state by enforcing a strict regime of strapping the King into a waistcoat and restraining him whenever he misbehaves. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales has been scheming to have himself made Prince Regent, at which point he will effectively be King. He allies with the opposition, led by Charles Fox, to Prime Minister William Pitt&apos;s increasingly unpopular government. Tensions rise as the day of the Prince&apos;s appointment as Regent draws near, but Dr Willis is making good progress with the King, managing to bring him from his raving and violent state of mind back to a level of normality. As he improves, the King becomes less eccentric, and even manages to recite Shakespeare. Once the Lord Chancellor, Baron Thurlow, hears of the King&apos;s rapid recovery, the race begins to get the King to Parliament in time to stop the Prince of Wales being appointed Regent. They arrive just in time, the Prince&apos;s plans are thwarted, and King George returns to the throne and to the loving company of his wife the Queen.

An urban myth has developed that the title change derives from the fear that American audiences would think the film was a sequel, because of the use of Roman numeral s in its title. However, Hytner has stated that the principal reason was to clarify that this was a film about a king, particularly in America as it is a country that has always been without royalty. { Snopes.com title change } The film&apos;s star, Nigel Hawthorne, confirmed this in interviews.In one scene a globe shows the United States map of 1846, although the film is set in 1788.
