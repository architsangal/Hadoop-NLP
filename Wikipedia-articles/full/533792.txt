Subsequently, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in a by-election in Montréal-Verdun on October 5, 1964, and was re-elected in the 1966 general election in Verdun. He earned a &quot; law and order &quot; reputation when he served successively as Solicitor General, Attorney General, and Minister of Justice from its creation in 1965 to 1966 in the government of Quebec Premier Jean Lesage. After losing the 1970 Quebec Liberal Party leadership election to Robert Bourassa, Wagner left politics to return to the bench, receiving appointment once more as a Sessions Court judge. He then entered federal politics, and was elected as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Saint-Hyacinthe in the 1972 federal election. { &quot; Pepin&apos;s defeat, Wagner victory fail to stop Liberals from retaining majority in Quebec &quot;. The Globe and Mail, October 31, 1972. } He was re-elected in the 1974 election, and stood as a candidate at the Progressive Conservative leadership convention of 1976. Wagner attracted support amongst Tories who believed that having a leader from Quebec would enable the party to break the federal Liberal Party&apos;s stranglehold on the province, and from right-wing Tories attracted by his law and order reputation. He was hurt by revelations of a slush fund that was funded by supporters so that he would be financially solvent if he lost in 1972. Wagner led on the first three ballots of the Convention, but lost to Joe Clark by 65 votes out of 2,309 on the fourth ballot. In 1978, he was elevated to the Canadian Senate by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and sat as a Progressive Conservative. { &quot; Trudeau finds a Senate seat for Claude Wagner &quot;.
