It is [ 688 mi km ] long. { U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 8, 2011 } It starts out as three separate forks that join in Harlan County, KY. Martins Fork starts in Hensley Settlement (Kentucky) on Brush Mountain in Bell County, KY and snakes its way north through the mountains to Baxter, KY. Clover Fork starts on Black Mountain (Kentucky) in Holmes Mill, KY, near the Virginia border, and flows west paralleling Kentucky Route 38 until it reaches Harlan, KY. Originally, Clover Fork flowed through downtown Harlan and merged with Martin&apos;s Fork at the intersection of Kentucky Route 38 and US Route 421. However, as part of a flood control project in 1992, the Clover Fork was diverted through a tunnel under Little Black Mountain, emerging in Baxter, KY where it joined with Martins Fork. Poor Fork starts as a small stream on Pine Mountain (Appalachian Mountains) in Letcher County, KY near Flat Gap, VA. It flows southwest paralleling Pine Mountain until it merges with the other two forks in Baxter, KY. From there, the wider river continues flowing west through the mountains of Kentucky to Cumberland Falls. Cumberland Falls, [ 68 ft m ] high, is one of the largest waterfalls in the eastern United States and is one of the few places in the Western Hemisphere where a moonbow can be seen. { Cumberland Falls Moonbow Retrieved on 2010-05-29 } Past Cumberland Falls, the river continues to grow in size as it merges with more creeks and streams. It is the source waters of the manmade Lake Cumberland as well as Old Hickory Lake northeast of Nashville, TN. After flowing through Nashville, the river continues west through Tennessee and back into Kentucky at the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, a section of land nestled between Lake Barkley, which is fed by the Cumberland River, and Kentucky Lake. Finally, the river flows north and merges with the Ohio River northwest of Paducah, KY. [ History ] During the early colonial period, the river was known as &quot; Warioto &quot; to the local Native Americans and as &quot; Shauvanon &quot; by French traders. It was also known as the &quot; Shawnee &quot; or &quot; Shawonoe &quot; before being known by its current name. Important first as a passage for hunters and settlers, the Cumberland River also supported later riverboat trade which reached to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Villages, towns and cities were located at landing points along its banks. Through the middle of the 19th century, settlers depended on rivers for trading and travel. In 1750, Dr. Thomas Walker led a party of hunters across the Appalachian Mountains from Virginia, mapped and named the river [ William W.

The river was also known as the Shawnee River (or Shawanoe River) for years after Walker&apos;s trip. [ 517018 Cumberland River ] In more recent history, a number of severe floods have struck various regions that the river flows through. In April of 1977, Harlan, KY and many surrounding communities were inundated with floodwaters, destroying most of the homes and businesses within the flood plain of the Cumberland River. This even led to the building of the Martins Fork Dam for flood control, the diversion of the Poor Fork around the city of Harlan, KY, as well as the diversion of the river through a mountain cut in Loyall, KY. In late April and early May 2010, due to extensive rains, the Cumberland River overflowed its banks and flooded Nashville and Clarksville. The downtown area was ordered to evacuate.
