It is the oldest continuously published newspaper on the U.S. west coast, founded as a weekly by Thomas J. Dryer on December 4, 1850. It is the largest newspaper in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest by circulation and the 19th largest daily newspaper in the country. [ Audit Bureau of Circulation http://abcas3.accessabc.com/ecirc/newstitlesearchus.asp 2010-09-06 2010-03-31 ] The Oregonian received the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting in 1999, and since then has received four other Pulitzers, including the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, and most recently, the prize for Breaking News Reporting in 2007. [ Targeted audience ] The Oregonian is home delivered throughout Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas, and Yamhill counties in Oregon and Clark County, Washington; it is also home delivered in parts of Marion and Columbia counties.

[ History ] [ Founding and early years ] The Oregonian was founded as the Weekly Oregonian in 1850. It was founded by businessmen whose goal was to establish a Whig -slanted newspaper to promote Portland. [ MacColl E.

Chapman, who recruited Thomas Jefferson Dryer, living in San Francisco, to serve as editor. The first issue was put out on December 4, 1850, running on &quot; Dryer&apos;s old hand press and worn type &quot;. Chapman may have coined the name, but the political tone of the paper came from Coffin, and Dryer &quot; ran the paper as his personal fief &quot;. Henry Pittock became the owner in 1861 as compensation for unpaid wages, and he began publishing the paper daily, except Sundays. [ Scott H. W. Harvey W. Scott The Press History of Portland, Oregon Syracuse, New York: D. Mason &amp; Co. Reprinted in Access Genealogy.AccessGenealogy.com. 1890 http://www.accessgenealogy.com/oregon/multnomah/press.htm 2006-12-23 ] Pittock&apos;s goal was to focus more on news than the bully pulpit established by Dryer. He ordered a new press in December 1860 and also arranged for the news to be sent by telegraph to Redding, California, then by stagecoach to Jacksonville, Oregon, and then by pony express to Portland. From 1866 to 1872 Harvey W. Scott was the editor. [ December 2007 ] Henry W. Corbett bought the paper from a cash-poor Pittock in October 1872 and placed William Lair Hill as editor. Scott, fired by Corbett for supporting Ben Holladay &apos;s candidates, became editor of Holladay&apos;s rival Bulletin newspaper. The paper went bankrupt around 1874, Holladay having lost $200,000 in the process. Corbett sold The Oregonian back to Pittock in 1877. One of the journalists who began his career on the Oregonian during this time period was James J. Montague who took over and wrote the column &quot; Slings &amp; Arrows &quot; until he was hired away by William Randolph Hearst in 1902. { James J. Montague, collected papers, Ithaca, New York } &apos;&apos;The Weekly Oregonian&apos;&apos; front page on March 19, 1859 In 1881, the first Sunday Oregonian was published. { Notson, Robert C. (December 6, 1981). &quot; 100 Years of Sunday Reading &quot;. The Sunday Oregonian, pp. NW4-NW11. } The paper became known as the voice of business-oriented Republicans, as evidenced by consistent endorsement of Republican candidates for president in every federal election before 1992. The paper&apos;s offices and presses were originally housed in a two-story building at the intersection of First Street (now First Avenue) and Morrison Street, but in 1892 the paper moved into a new nine-story building at 6th and Alder streets, not moving again until 1948. [ Expansion into broadcasting ] [ Ben Hur Lampman ] &apos;&apos;The Morning Oregonian&apos;&apos;, January 22, 1912. In 1922, The Morning Oregonian launched KGW, Oregon&apos;s first commercial radio station. Five years later, KGW affiliated with NBC (1927). The Morning Oregonian purchased a second station, KEX, in 1933, from NBC subsidiary Northwest Broadcasting Co. In 1944, KEX was sold to Westinghouse Radio Stations, Inc. The Oregonian launched KGW-FM, the Northwest&apos;s first FM station, [ December 2007 ] in 1946 (acclaimed by &quot; The Oregonian &quot; May 8, 1946), known today as KKRZ. KGW and KGW-FM were sold to King Broadcasting Co in 1953. In 1937, The Morning Oregonian shortened its name to The Oregonian. Two years later, associate editor Ronald G. Callvert received a Pulitzer Prize for editorial reporting for &quot; distinguished editorial writing...as exemplified by the editorial entitled &quot; My Country &apos;Tis of Thee. &quot;. [ http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1939 The Pulitzer Prizes 1939 Winners 2009-04-03 ] In 1948, the paper moved to its present location, the Oregonian Building, designed by Pietro Belluschi, located at SW Broadway between Jefferson Street and Madison Street. The block was previously home to the William S. Ladd mansion, which had been demolished around 1925. Circa 1946, The Oregonian purchased the block for $100,000, which led to complaints from paper editor Leslie M. Scott because of the outrageous price. Three years later, Scott purchased a nearby block for the state at $300,000 while holding the office of Oregon State Treasurer. The new Oregonian building was to contain the KGW radio station and a television studio, as well as a large and opulent dining room. The contractor was L. H. Hoffman, who was under a very profitable cost-plus contract. Aside from the &quot; extravagance of design &quot;, construction materials in short supply, the nation was under heavy inflation, and Belluschi&apos;s plans were never ready, leading to massive costs. The Oregonian had to borrow from banks, the first time in over 50 years. New company president E. B. MacNaughton was forced to exhaust the company&apos;s loan limits at First National Bank, then turn to the Bank of America. MacNaughton then eliminated an extra elevator, the dining room, and KGW&apos;s radio and television studios. The building still cost $4 million, twice the original estimate. The building opened in 1948, but The Oregonian had to sell it to Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company for $3.6 million in a leaseback arrangement. Further financial issues led to the 1950 sale to Samuel Newhouse. [ The Newhouse era ] In 1950, Advance Publications founder S. I. &quot; Si &quot; Newhouse purchased the paper. At that time, the sale price of $5.6 million was the largest for a single newspaper. [ December 2007 ] The sale was announced on December 11, 1950. In 1954, Newhouse bought 50% of Mount Hood Radio &amp; Television Broadcasting Corp, which broadcasts KOIN -TV, Portland&apos;s first VHF television station, KOIN AM (now KUFO ), and KOIN-FM (now KXL-FM ). The Oregonian&apos;s circulation in 1950 was 214,916; that of the rival Oregon Journal was 190,844. [ The Press: Snap the Whip January 23, 1950 Time magazine http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C858588%2C00.html ] In 1957, staff writers William Lambert and Wallace Turner were awarded the that year&apos;s Pulitzer Prize for Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting, No Edition Time. [ http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1957 The Pulitzer Prizes 1957 Winners 2009-04-03 ] Their prize cited &quot; their expose of vice and corruption in Portland involving some municipal officials and officers of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, Western Conference &quot; and noted that &quot; they fulfilled their assignments despite great handicaps and the risk of reprisal from lawless elements. &quot; What was to become a long and heated strike began against both The Oregonian and The Oregon Journal began in November 1959. The strike was called by Stereotypers Local 49 over various contract issues, particularly the introduction of more automated plate-casting machinery; the new-to-American-publishing German-made equipment required one operator instead of the four that operated the existing equipment. Wallace Turner and many other writers and photographers refused to cross the picket lines and never returned. The two newspapers published a &quot; joint, typo-marred paper &quot; for six months until they had hired enough nonunion help to resume separate operations. Starting in February 1960, striking union workers published a daily newspaper, The (Portland) Reporter; its circulation peaked at 78,000, but was shut down in October 1964. In 1961, Newhouse bought The Oregon Journal, Portland&apos;s afternoon daily newspaper. Production and business operations of the two newspapers were consolidated in The Oregonian&apos;s building, while their editorial staffs remained separate. [ September 2009 ] The National Labor Relations Board ruled the strike illegal in November 1963. Strikers continued to picket until April 4, 1965, at which point the two newspapers became open shop s. [ One newspaper city ] In 1967, Fred Stickel came to The Oregonian from New Jersey to become general manager of the paper; he became president in 1972 and publisher in 1975.

At the same time, KOIN-AM and -FM were sold to Gaylord Broadcasting Co. Since S. I. Newhouse died in 1979, S.I. Jr. has managed the magazine s, and Donald oversees the newspapers. The Oregonian lost its prime &apos;competitor&apos; and Portland became a one-daily-newspaper city in 1982, when Advance/Newhouse shut down the Journal, citing declining advertising revenues. [ September 2009 ] [ 1987-2000 ] William A. Hilliard was named editor in 1987, and was the paper&apos;s first African-American editor. [ Sarasohn David David Sarasohn William A.

[ September 2010 ] Also in 1989, The Oregonian recalled an edition featuring an article that criticized a prominent local business and advertising customer; in 1992, the Wall Street Journal cited The Oregonian as an example of a newspaper muffling its criticism of business to appeal to commercial advertisers. [ September 2010 ] The Oregonian endorsed a Democratic candidate for president for the first time in its history when it supported Bill Clinton in 1992.

Robert M. Landauer, then editorial page editor, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Writing for &quot; a bold campaign to defuse myths and prejudice promoted by an anti-homosexual constitutional amendment, which was subsequently defeated &quot;, according to the Pulitzer judges. The integrity of The Oregonian became the subject of national coverage when The Washington Post broke the story of inappropriate sexual advances which led to the resignation of Oregon senator Bob Packwood four years later. This prompted some to joke, &quot; If it matters to Oregonians, it&apos;s in the Washington Post &quot; (a twist on the Oregonian&apos;s slogan &quot; If it matters to Oregonians, it&apos;s in The Oregonian).

According to Editor &amp; Publisher, soon after Rowe&apos;s arrival, she introduced organizational changes to the newsroom. Instead of having a large number of general assignment reporters, she organized them around teams, many of which often develop &quot; subject expertise &quot; that &quot; reflect[s] the interests of readers, not traditional newsroom boundaries. &quot; Examples (over the years) include &quot; Northwest Issues and Environment &quot;, &quot; Living In the &apos;90s &quot; / &quot; How We Live &quot;, &quot; Politics and Accountability &quot;, &quot; Health, Science, and Medicine &quot;, &quot; Sustainability and Growth &quot;, and &quot; Higher Education &quot;. { Newsroom Roster from the paper&apos;s website } Accompanying the reorganization was a more bottom-up approach to identifying stories: &quot; instead of having an assignment-driven newspaper, you have the beat reporters coming to editors with what is going on &quot;, with the team editors responsible for deciding what stories were covered by their teams. The position of public editor was established at The Oregonian in 1993, and Robert Caldwell was appointed. { Robert Caldwell, Editorial Page Editor from the paper&apos;s website } Michele McLellan assumed the role three years later, and was delegated the authority to decide whether or not a newspaper error should result in the publication of a correction. { Details Matter: Accuracy, a July 23, 2002 article written by Michele McLellan for the } { Newspaper Credibility Handbook at the } { American Society of Newspaper Editors website } The paper and several reporters were recognized for excellence in 1999. Staff writer Richard Read won the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, for a series, The French Fry Connection, that illustrated the impact of the Asian economic crisis, by reducing local french fries exports. Co-worker Tom Hallman Jr., was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing, for his &quot; unique profile of a man struggling to recover from a brain injury &quot;. The paper won Overseas Press Club awards for business reporting, and for human rights reporting. The editors of Columbia Journalism Review recognized The Oregonian as number twelve on its list of &quot; America&apos;s Best Newspapers &quot;, and the best newspaper owned by the Newhouse family. [ Since 2000 ] In 2000, The Oregonian was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for its coverage of an environmental disaster created when the New Carissa, a freighter that carried nearly 400,000 gallons of heavy fuel, ran aground February 4, 1999, north of Coos Bay, Oregon. The articles detailed &quot; how fumbling efforts of official agencies failed to contain the far-reaching damage &quot;, according to the Pulitzer jury. That same year reporters Brent Walth and Alex Pulaski were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Writing for their series on political influences in pesticide regulation. The Oregonian and news staff were acknowledged with two Pulitzer Prizes in 2001. The paper was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, for its &quot; detailed and unflinching examination of systematic problems within the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, including harsh treatment of foreign nationals and other widespread abuses, which prompted various reforms. &quot; Staff writer Tom Hallman Jr. received a Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his series, The Boy Behind the Mask, on a teen with a facial deformity.
