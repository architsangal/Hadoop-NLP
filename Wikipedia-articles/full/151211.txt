The population was 57,755 at the 2000 census. [ Geography and history ] Port Arthur is located on the western bank of Sabine Lake. The Rainbow Bridge across the Neches River connects Port Arthur to Bridge City. Aurora was located near the mouth of Taylor Bayou on Sabine Lake, at the site of present-day Port Arthur. The town was conceived as early as 1837, and by 1840 promoters led by Almanzon Huston were advertising town lots. Although some lots were sold, Houston&apos;s project failed to materialize. The area came to be known as Sparks after John Sparks and his family moved to the shores of Sabine Lake near the Aurora townsite. The Eastern Texas Railroad, completed between Sabine Pass and Beaumont just before the outbreak of the Civil War, passed about four miles west of Sparks. The railroad passing track at this point was named Aurora after the Houston project. The rails were removed during the Civil War. A few scattered settlers remained until 1886, when a destructive hurricane led residents to dismantle their homes and move to Beaumont. By 1895 Aurora was a ghost town. The abandoned community, however, soon became the site of Arthur E. Stilwell&apos;s new city, Port Arthur. [ Wooster Robert AURORA, TX (JEFFERSON COUNTY), &quot; Handbook of Texas Online http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hva32 February 21, 2011 ] Port Arthur was founded by Arthur Edward Stilwell in the late 19th century, and was once the center of the largest oil refinery network in the world. { Hunt, Herschiel.

[ June 2010 ] Several large projects involving the energy infrastructure are underway or proposed, the two largest being the Golden Pass and Sabine Pass LNG terminals. These separate projects under construction in neighboring Sabine Pass have brought cumulative initial investments of $2 billion, and will employ thousands at peak construction. [ June 2010 ] Home to a large portion of United States refining capacity, Port Arthur is now seeing renewed investment in several key installations. Motiva Enterprises is undertaking a major addition to its western Port Arthur refinery, expanding capacity to [ 600000 oilbbl/d ]. { The Economy of Southeast Texas Home Page } This $10.0 billion project is the largest US refinery expansion to occur in 30 years.

The Hotel Sabine, the tallest building in Port Arthur, was abandoned and purchased by the city. An attempt to sell the building failed in 2005, with no interested buyers. Hurricane Rita struck a direct hit on the Proctor Street Seawall, and damaged many downtown businesses and homes. As economic activity picks up in the region, calls for downtown revitalization have been advanced. { Sanders, Ashley. &quot; Plant expansions to create a housing boon. &quot; } { The News.

Several municipal and county offices have moved in to fill the void. [ September 2010 ] [ Air pollution ] Port Arthur also has a significant air pollution problem that some believe has an impact on the health of its residents. [ September 2007 ] There are 4 large industrial complexes in the southern part of the city. These factories can have upsets, incidents where a dangerous situation at the plant necessitates the release of thousands of pounds of air toxins, often volatile organic compound s or nitrogen oxide s, the two major contributors to ground-level ozone. { &apos;&apos; &quot; Port Arthur Stinks. Story by David Stiles. &quot; } { KPFT-FM, retrieved January 31, 2007 } The chemicals are run through flares that incinerate almost all of the substance through combustion, but may still infrequently emit dangerous amounts. Any such releases are reported to the TCEQ and EPA, and are typically reported to the media through Sabine-Neches Fire Chiefs or the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee. The high incidences of asthma and cancer among residents in western Port Arthur is often attributed to the frequency and magnitude of the upsets, but could also be attributed to low general health often observed in poor areas. [ September 2007 ] [ Tropical cyclones that affected Port Arthur ] { Hurricane Ike } [ Hurricane Rita ] In September 2005&apos;s Hurricane Rita, Port Arthur sustained major wind damage and some flooding. [ Hurricane Humberto ] Struck in the early hours of September 13, 2007. It formed in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and intensified faster than any other tropical cyclone on record before making landfall at High Island, Texas. The path of the eye continued northeastward and passed over Port Arthur, Nederland, Port Neches, Groves, and Bridge City, Texas at Category 1 hurricane strength. This was the second time within two years (following Hurricane Rita on September 24, 2005) that these cities experienced a direct hit from a hurricane. Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 85  mph (140  km/h) about two hours after landfall. However, post-storm analysis later determined that the winds were a bit stronger—about 90  mph (150  km/h). [ Tropical Storm Edouard ] On the morning of August 5, 2008, Port Arthur saw the effects of Tropical Storm Edouard. The tropical storm made landfall to the west of the city, and wind speeds of [ 55 mi/h km/h on ] were recorded. { Port Arthur,Texas Hurricanes } [ Hurricane Ike ] In September 2008, Port Arthur again sustained major wind damage, with several areas experiencing major flooding. Ike made its final landfall near Galveston, Texas as a strong Category 2 hurricane, with Category 4 equivalent storm surge, on Sept. 13, 2008, at 2:10 a.m. CDT. Hurricane-force winds extended 120 miles (193  km) from the center. Due to its immense size, Ike caused devastation from the Louisiana coastline all the way to the Kennedy County, Texas region near Corpus Christi, Texas. The hurricane also resulted in the largest evacuation of Texans in that state&apos;s history. It became the largest search-and-rescue operation in U.S. history. The seawall of Port Arthur protected the city from the storm surge that devastated surrounding communities such as Bridge City, but water did overtop the seawall for about 30 minutes, flooding some of homes along its length with over a foot of water.
