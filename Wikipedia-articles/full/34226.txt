He was the first human to journey into outer space, when his Vostok spacecraft completed an orbit of the Earth on 12 April 1961. Gagarin became an international celebrity, and was awarded many medals and honours, including Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation&apos;s highest honour. Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission (which ended in a fatal crash). Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, which was later named after him. Gagarin died in 1968 when a MiG 15 training jet he was piloting crashed. [ Early life ] Yuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino near Gzhatsk (now in Smolensk Oblast, Russia ), on 9 March 1934. [ The Great Explorers Thames &amp; Hudson London Robin Hanbury-Tenison 270 2010 978-0-500-25169-0 ] The adjacent town of Gzhatsk was renamed Gagarin in 1968 in his honour. His parents, Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina, worked on a collective farm.

Yuri was the third of four children, and his elder sister helped raise him while his parents worked. Like millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. After a German officer took over their house, the family constructed a small mud hut where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.

In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk. [ Career in the Soviet Air Force ] In his youth, Gagarin became interested in space and planets.

While there, he joined the &quot; AeroClub &quot;, and learned to fly a light aircraft, a hobby that would take up an increasing portion of his time. In 1955, after completing his technical schooling, he entered military flight training at the Orenburg Pilot&apos;s School. While there he met Valentina Goryacheva, whom he married in 1957, after gaining his pilot&apos;s wings in a MiG-15. Post-graduation, he was assigned to Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Force on 5 November 1957 and on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.

Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective cosmonauts were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov because of their performance in training, as well as their physical characteristics  — space was at a premium in the small Vostok cockpit and both men were rather short. Gagarin was [ 1.57 m ftin ] tall, which was an advantage in the small Vostok cockpit. In August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, an Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows: [ [M]odest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends. Soviet Air Force doctor Quoted in Siddiqi, p.262 ] Gagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin. { Siddiqi, p.262 } One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary. { Siddiqi, p.261 } Gagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote: [ Service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper... I don&apos;t think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts. Bykovsky quoted in Gavrilin, p26-7 ] In addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being an umpire/referee. { Sport in the Soviet Union (Oxford Pergamon, 1980, ISBN 0-08-024506-4), p43 } [ Space flight ] { RKK Energiya museum } [ Vostok 1 ] On 12 April 1961, aboard the Vostok 3KA-3 ( Vostok 1 ), Gagarin became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the earth. His call sign was Kedr ( Siberian Pine, [ Кедр ] ). { Siddiqi, p.275 } In his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space: [ The feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended. Quoted in Siddiqi, p.278 ] Following the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune &quot; The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows &quot; ( [ &quot; Родина слышит, Родина знает &quot; ] ).

Some sources have claimed that Gagarin commented during the flight, &quot; I don&apos;t see any God up here. &quot; However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with Earth-based stations during the spaceflight.

In attending various functions and receptions in his honour, he consumed large amounts of vodka and other alcoholic beverages, even though otherwise he was not a regular drinker. His physical appearance changed and he became noticeably heavier. The attention of female fans took a toll on his marriage. It was rumoured that his wife once caught him in a hotel room with another woman and Gagarin jumped out of the second floor window and hit his face on a kerbstone, which resulted in a deep cut above his left eye. The scar remained visible after the incident. { BBC World | Profile: Yuri Gagarin } In 1962, he began serving as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent seven years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became Lieutenant Colonel (or Podpolkovnik ) of the Soviet Air Force on 12 June 1962 and on 6 November 1963 he received the rank of Colonel ( Polkovnik ) of the Soviet Air Force. Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for his friend Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight, which was launched despite Gagarin&apos;s protests that additional safety precautions were needed.

Gagarin had become deputy training director of the Star City cosmonaut training base. At the same time, he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot. [ Death ] On 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square. Gagarin was survived by his wife Valentina, and daughters Elena and Galina.

Soviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB&apos;s report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of air base personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin&apos;s planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin&apos;s aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not properly react to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin. [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1425937/KGB-held-ground-staff-to-blame-for-Gagarin%27s-death.html KGB held ground staff to blame for Gagarin&apos;s death The Daily Telegraph Ben Aris 28 March 2008 1 August 2008 ] In his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard &quot; two loud booms in the distance. &quot; Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 &apos;Flagon&apos; ) was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and &quot; without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin&apos;s plane while breaking the sound barrier. &quot; The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin&apos;s plane crashing. [ Two Sides of the Moon Thomas Dunne Books New York Alexei Leonov Scott, David 2004 218 0-312-30865-5 56587777 ] Another theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.

This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash. [ http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/What-Made-Yuri-Fall.html What Made Yuri Fall?

Those documents revealed that the commission&apos;s original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a &quot; super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions, &quot; or to avoid &quot; entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover &quot;.
