On 6 September 2006, he resigned his ministerial position and released a further statement calling on Tony Blair to resign: { Blair under pressure to name day, } { BBC News Online, 6 September 2006; retrieved 6 September 2006 } [ It is with the greatest sadness that I have to say that I no longer believe that your remaining in office is in the interest of either the party or the country … How and why this situation has arisen no longer matters. I share the view of the overwhelming majority of the party and the country that the only way the party and the government can renew itself in office is urgently to renew its leadership. ] Tony Blair was quoted by the BBC as saying that the statement and letter from Watson was &quot; disloyal, discourteous and wrong &quot; and that he would be seeing Watson later in the day. He said that he had planned to dismiss Watson from Government for having signed the letter urging him to resign. Within days of the incident suggestions appeared that Watson had been to Chancellor Gordon Brown&apos;s residence in Scotland only the day before the memo was sent to Tony Blair. Watson claimed he was dropping off a present for Brown&apos;s new baby Fraser and that neither the issue of the note, nor &quot; any politics &quot; were discussed. [ February 2007 ] As Watson recounted on his weblog, his reception at the Labour Party Conference a few weeks after his resignation got a mixed reaction from Labour Party colleagues. Some sought him out to congratulate him, whilst others sought him out to be sarcastic or to be abusive. One such encounter was with Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who asked Watson, whilst he was waiting to be interviewed by Channel 4 News, if he was &quot; going to resign again? &quot; Watson&apos;s actions, by his own admission on his weblog and elsewhere, angered many of his colleagues within the Labour Party, but also pleased many. He returned to government following Brown&apos;s appointment as Prime Minister in June 2007, in apparent contravention of a promise allegedly made in 2006 never to do so. [ August 2010 ] [ Expenses scandal ] [ United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal ] On 10 May 2009 it was revealed that since being re-elected as MP in 2005, Watson claimed the maximum £4,800 allowance for food in a single year.

He added: All claims were made under the rules set out by the House of Commons authorities. I fully understand why the public expects the system to be reformed. I voted for this last week and only hope that reforms can go even further as quickly as possible. [ Opposition to the Digital Economy Act ] Tom Watson led a number of MPs in speaking out firmly against the Digital Economy Act 2010, as the bill was being passed through Parliament in April 2010 during the &apos;wash-up&apos; period before the election. He took part in a protest against the bill outside Parliament on 24 March 2010.

The kind of material broadcast by Glenn Beck is not unique; a number of other &apos;shock jocks&apos; operate in the States. However, none has displayed intolerance on such a frequent and irresponsible scale as Glenn Beck. It is vital that that kind of &apos;news&apos; is not made or broadcast in the UK. However, the proposed acquisition of BSkyB by News Corp means that there is an increased threat of its becoming a reality. &quot; { Linkins, Jason (2011-01-21) British MP Tom Watson To Glenn Beck: &apos;You Are A Bigot&apos;, } { Huffington Post } [ In Opposition ] Watson played a significant role in the News International phone hacking scandal by helping to bring the series of events at the News of the World into the open.

It appeared that Watson was not going to be summonsed to appear as the Leveson Enquiry had deemed that he copied it from the Guido Fawkes blog, a version that had been redacted. No details are to hand to verify the dates and times of his publication, nor how it appeared to be unredacted.
