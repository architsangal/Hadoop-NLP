When Bradman was about two-and-a-half years old, his parents moved to Bowral in the NSW Southern Highlands. Bradman practised batting incessantly during his youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball. { A stump is considerably narrower than a bat; the diameter of a golf ball is similarly smaller than that of a cricket ball. } A water tank, mounted on a curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt to hit it again.

During the season, Bradman&apos;s father took him to the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) to watch the fifth Ashes Test match. On that day, Bradman formed an ambition. &quot; I shall never be satisfied &quot;, he told his father, &quot; until I play on this ground &quot;. { Perry (1995), p 24. } Bradman left school in 1922 and went to work for a local real estate agent who encouraged his sporting pursuits by giving him time off when necessary.

Against Wingello, a team that included the future Test bowler Bill O&apos;Reilly, Bradman made 234. { Page (1983), pp 21–23. } In the competition final against Moss Vale, which extended over five consecutive Saturdays, Bradman scored 320 not out. During the following Australian winter (1926), an ageing Australian team lost The Ashes in England, and a number of Test players retired. { Harte (1993), pp 300–302. } The New South Wales Cricket Association began a hunt for new talent. Mindful of Bradman&apos;s big scores for Bowral, the association wrote to him, requesting his attendance at a practice session in Sydney. He was subsequently chosen for the &quot; Country Week &quot; tournaments at both cricket and tennis, to be played during separate weeks. His boss presented him with an ultimatum: he could have only one week away from work, and therefore had to choose between the two sports.

Despite his potential, Bradman was not chosen for the Australian second team to tour New Zealand. { Bradman (1950), p 25. } Bradman decided that his chances for Test selection would be improved by moving to Sydney for the 1928–29 season, when England were to tour in defence of the Ashes.

Sure enough, it pitched exactly where I had anticipated, and, hooking it to the square-leg boundary, I established the only record upon which I had set my heart. { Quoted in Haigh 2008. } Although he was an obvious selection to tour England, Bradman&apos;s unorthodox style raised doubts that he could succeed on the slower English pitches. Percy Fender wrote: { Quoted by Page (1983), p 49. } [... he will always be in the category of the brilliant, if unsound, ones. Promise there is in Bradman in plenty, though watching him does not inspire one with any confidence that he desires to take the only course which will lead him to a fulfilment of that promise. He makes a mistake, then makes it again and again; he does not correct it, or look as if he were trying to do so. He seems to live for the exuberance of the moment. ] The encomiums were not confined to his batting gifts; nor did the criticism extend to his character. &quot; Australia has unearthed a champion, &quot; raved former Australian Test great Clem Hill, &quot; self-taught, with natural ability.

Significantly, he had not hit a six, which typified Bradman&apos;s attitude: if he hit the ball along the ground, then it could not be caught. During this phase of his career, his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a &quot; machine-like &quot; approach to batting.

Between these two seasons, Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, according to the rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman&apos;s dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.

To that end, Warner orchestrated the appointment of Douglas Jardine as England captain in 1931, as a prelude to Jardine leading the 1932–33 tour to Australia, with Warner as team manager. { Frith (2002), pp 40–41. } Remembering that Bradman had struggled against bouncers during his 232 at The Oval in 1930, Jardine decided to combine traditional leg theory with short-pitched bowling to combat Bradman. He settled on the Nottinghamshire fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce as the spearheads for his tactics. In support, the England selectors chose another three pacemen for the squad. The unusually high number of fast bowlers caused a lot of comment in both countries and roused Bradman&apos;s own suspicions. Bradman had other problems to deal with at this time; among these were bouts of illness from an undiagnosed malaise which had begun during the tour of North America, { Williams (1996), pp 90–91. } and that the Australian Board of Control had initially refused permission for him to write a column for the Sydney Sun. Bradman, who had signed a two-year contract with the newspaper, threatened to withdraw from cricket to honour his contract when the board denied him permission to write; eventually, the paper released Bradman from the contract, in a victory for the Board. In three first-class games against England before the Tests, Bradman averaged just 17.16 in 6  innings. { Bradman (1950), p 60. } Jardine decided to give the new tactics a trial in only one game, a fixture against an Australian XI at Melbourne. In this match, Bradman faced the leg theory and later warned local administrators that trouble was brewing if it continued.

Despite his absence, England employed what were already becoming known as the Bodyline tactics against the Australian batsmen and won an ill-tempered match. The famous duck: Bradman bowled by Bowes at the MCG, in front of a world record crowd assembled to see Bradman defeat Bodyline The public clamoured for the return of Bradman to defeat Bodyline: &quot; he was the batsman who could conquer this cankerous bowling  ... &apos;Bradmania&apos;, amounting almost to religious fervour, demanded his return &quot;. { Whitington (1974), p 170. } Recovered from his indisposition, Bradman returned to the side in Alan Kippax &apos;s position. A world record crowd of 63,993 at the MCG saw Bradman come to the crease on the first day of the Second Test with the score at 2/67. A standing ovation ensued that delayed play for several minutes. { Williams (1996), pp 97–98. } Bradman anticipated receiving a bouncer as his first ball and, as the bowler delivered, he moved across his stumps to play the hook shot. The ball failed to rise and Bradman dragged it onto his stumps; the first-ball duck was his first in a Test. The crowd fell into stunned silence as he walked off. However, Australia took a first innings lead in the match, and another record crowd on 2 January 1933 watched Bradman hit a counter-attacking second innings century. His unbeaten 103 (from 146  balls) in a team total of 191 helped set England a target of 251 to win. Bill O&apos;Reilly and Bert Ironmonger bowled Australia to a series-levelling victory amid hopes that Bodyline was beaten.

There were angry crowd scenes after the Australian captain Bill Woodfull and wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield were hit by bouncers. An apologetic Plum Warner entered the Australian dressing room and was rebuked by Woodfull. Woodfull&apos;s remarks (that &quot;...there are two teams out there and only one of them is playing cricket &quot; ) were leaked to the press, and Warner and others attributed this to Fingleton, however for many years (even after Fingleton&apos;s death) a bitter war of accusation passed between Fingleton and Bradman as to who was the real source of the leak. In a cable to the MCC, the Australian Board of Control repeated the allegation of poor sportsmanship directed at Warner by Woodfull.

The tourists won the last three Tests convincingly and regained the Ashes. Bradman caused controversy with his own tactics. Always seeking to score, and with the leg side packed with fielders, he often backed away and hit the ball into the vacant half of the outfield with unorthodox shots reminiscent of tennis or golf. { Williams (1996), p 99. } This brought him 396 runs ( at 56.57) for the series and plaudits for attempting to find a solution to Bodyline, although his series average was just 57% of his career mean. Jack Fingleton was in no doubt that Bradman&apos;s game altered irrevocably as a consequence of Bodyline, writing: { Fingleton (1949), p 198. } [ Bodyline was specially prepared, nurtured for and expended on him and, in consequence, his technique underwent a change quicker than might have been the case with the passage of time. Bodyline plucked something vibrant from his art. ] The constant glare of celebrity and the tribulations of the season forced Bradman to reappraise his life outside the game and to seek a career away from his cricketing fame.

Unknown to the public, the SA Cricket Association (SACA) instigated Hodgetts&apos; approach and subsidised Bradman&apos;s wage. { Harte (1993), pp 352–353. } Although his wife was hesitant about moving, Bradman eventually agreed to the deal in February 1934. { Williams (1996), p 119–120. } [ Declining health and a brush with death ] In his farewell season for NSW, Bradman averaged 132.44, his best yet.

Bradman told Cardus, &quot; I don&apos;t believe in the law of averages &quot;. { Rosenwater (1978), p 229. } In the event, Bradman batted all of the second day and into the third, putting on a then world record partnership of 388 with Bill Ponsford.

Seemingly restored to full health, Bradman blazed two centuries in the last two games of the tour. However, when he returned to London to prepare for the trip home, he experienced severe abdominal pain. It took a doctor more than 24  hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately. Bradman lost a lot of blood during the four-hour procedure and peritonitis set in. Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition. { Williams (1996), pp 136–37. } On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently. { O&apos;Reilly (1985), p 139. } &quot; The effect of the announcement was little short of spectacular &quot;. The hospital could not deal with the number of donors, and closed its switchboard in the face of the avalanche of telephone calls generated by the news. Journalists were asked by their editors to prepare obituaries. Teammate Bill O&apos;Reilly took a call from King George&apos;s secretary asking that the King be kept informed of the situation. Jessie Bradman started the month-long journey to London as soon as she received the news. En route, she heard a rumour that her husband had died. A telephone call clarified the situation and by the time she reached London, Bradman had begun a slow recovery. He followed medical advice to convalesce, taking several months to return to Australia and missing the 1934–35 Australian season. [ Internal politics and the Test captaincy ] { Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1937. His 270  runs won the match for Australia and has been rated the greatest innings of all time. } There was off-field intrigue in Australian cricket during the antipodean winter of 1935. Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, needed to replace the retired Bill Woodfull as captain. The Board of Control wanted Bradman to lead the team, yet, on 8  August, the Board announced Bradman&apos;s withdrawal from the team due to a lack of fitness. Surprisingly, in the light of this announcement, Bradman led the South Australian team in a full programme of matches that season. { Bradman (1950), pp 94–97. } The captaincy was given to Vic Richardson, Bradman&apos;s predecessor as South Australian captain. [ http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/7346.html Vic Richardson  – player profile Cricinfo 2008-06-17 ] { Richardson&apos;s record in 14  Tests was 622  runs at 24.88. Against South Africa, he made 84  runs in 5  innings. } Cricket author Chris Harte&apos;s analysis of the situation is that a prior (unspecified) commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. { Harte (1993), p 360. } Harte attributed an ulterior motive to his relocation: the off-field behaviour of Richardson and other South Australian players had displeased the South Australia Cricket Association (SACA), which was looking for new leadership. To help improve discipline, Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams. { Harte (1993), p 352. } He took his adopted state to its first Sheffield Shield title for 10  years, Bradman weighing in with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria. He finished the season with 369 (in 233  minutes), a South Australian record, made against Tasmania. The bowler who dismissed him, Reginald Townley, would later become leader of the Tasmanian Liberal Party. Australia defeated South Africa 4–0 and senior players such as Bill O&apos;Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson&apos;s captaincy. { O&apos;Reilly (1985), pp 144–145. } A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities in his role as a selector. { Williams (1996), p 148. } To start the new season, the Test side played a &quot; Rest of Australia &quot; team, captained by Bradman, at Sydney in early October 1936. The Test XI suffered a big defeat, due to Bradman&apos;s 212 and a haul of 12 wickets taken by leg-spinner Frank Ward. { Harte (1993), p 369. } Bradman let the members of the Test team know that despite their recent success, the team still required improvement. Shortly afterwards, Bradman&apos;s first child was born on 28 October, but died the next day. He took time out of cricket for two weeks and on his return made 192 in three hours against Victoria in the last match before the beginning of the Ashes series. The Test selectors made five changes to the team who had played in the previous Test match. Significantly, Australia&apos;s most successful bowler Clarrie Grimmett was replaced by Ward, one of four players making their debut. Bradman&apos;s role in Grimmett&apos;s omission from the team was controversial and it became a theme that dogged Bradman as Grimmett continued to be prolific in domestic cricket while his successors were ineffective—he was regarded as having finished the veteran bowler&apos;s Test career in a political purge.

The Australians could not take advantage of a pitch that favoured batting, and finished the day at 6/181. On the second day, rain dramatically altered the course of the game. With the sun drying the pitch (in those days, covers could not be used during matches) Bradman declared to get England in to bat while the pitch was &quot; sticky &quot;; England also declared to get Australia back in, conceding a lead of 124. Bradman countered by reversing his batting order to protect his run-makers while conditions improved. The ploy worked and Bradman went in at number seven.

The annual salary of £1,000 would make Bradman financially secure while allowing him to retain a connection with the game. { Williams (1996), pp 182–183. &quot; Nevertheless, the Secretaryship of the Melbourne Cricket Club was, and indeed, still is one of the most attractive jobs in the world of Australian cricket  ... &quot; } On 18 January 1939, the club&apos;s committee, on the casting vote of the chairman, chose former Test batsman Vernon Ransford over Bradman. { Coleman (1993) pp 425–426. } The 1939–40 season was Bradman&apos;s most productive ever for SA: 1,448  runs at an average of 144.8.

Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight. { Page (1983), p 266–267. } Invalided out of service in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed stockbroking during 1942.

RC Robertson-Glasgow observed of Bradman that: [ Next to Mr. Winston Churchill, he was the most celebrated man in England during the summer of 1948. His appearances throughout the country were like one continuous farewell matinée. At last his batting showed human fallibility. Often, especially at the start of the innings, he played where the ball wasn&apos;t, and spectators rubbed their eyes. ] Despite his waning powers, Bradman compiled 11 centuries on the tour, amassing 2,428 runs (average  89.92). His highest score of the tour (187) came against Essex, when Australia compiled a world record of 721 runs in a day. In the Tests, he scored a century at Nottingham, but the performance most like his pre-war exploits came in the Fourth Test at Leeds. England declared on the last morning of the game, setting Australia a world record 404 runs to win in only 345  minutes on a heavily worn wicket. In partnership with Arthur Morris (182), Bradman reeled off 173 not out and the match was won with 15  minutes to spare. The journalist Ray Robinson called the victory &quot; the &apos;finest ever&apos; in its conquest of seemingly insuperable odds &quot;. { Quoted by Page (1983), p 312. } In the final Test at The Oval, Bradman walked out to bat in Australia&apos;s first innings. He received a standing ovation from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition. His Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, it would have been 100. A story developed over the years that claimed Bradman missed the ball because of tears in his eyes, a claim Bradman denied for the rest of his life.

The position of Bradman&apos;s left foot in relation to the stumps is an example of how he } { used the crease when batting. } Bradman&apos;s early development was shaped by the high bounce of the ball on matting-over-concrete pitches. He favoured &quot; horizontal-bat &quot; shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) to deal with the bounce and devised a unique grip on the bat handle that would accommodate these strokes without compromising his ability to defend. Employing a side-on stance at the wicket, Bradman kept perfectly still as the bowler ran in.

He &quot; used the crease &quot; by either coming metres down the wicket to drive, or playing so far back that his feet ended up level with the stumps when playing the cut, hook or pull. { Robinson (1981), p 139. } Bradman&apos;s game evolved with experience. He temporarily adapted his technique during the Bodyline series, deliberately moving around the crease in an attempt to score from the short-pitched deliveries. { Bradman (1950), p 74. } At his peak, in the mid-1930s, he had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded. After the Second World War, he adjusted to bat within the limitations set by his age, becoming a steady &quot; accumulator &quot; of runs. { Fingleton (1949), pp 209–211. } However, Bradman never truly mastered batting on sticky wicket s. Wisden commented, &quot; [i]f there really is a blemish on his amazing record it is  ... the absence of a significant innings on one of those &apos;sticky dogs&apos; of old &quot;.
