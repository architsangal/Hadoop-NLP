It is the only Southern Iroquoian language that remains spoken. { Feeling, &quot; Dictionary, &quot; p. viii } Cherokee is a polysynthetic language. [ North American etymology ] The North American origins and eventual English language form of &quot; Cherokee &quot; were researched by James Mooney in the nineteenth century. In his Myths of the Cherokee (1888) he reports: &quot; It first appears as Chalaque in the Portuguese narrative of De Soto&apos;s expedition, published originally in 1557, while we find Cheraqui in a French document of 1699, and Cherokee as an English form as early, at least, as 1708. The name has thus an authentic [sic] history of 360 years. &quot; Mooney, James. King, Duane (ed.). Myths of the Cherokee. Barnes &amp; Noble. New York. 1888 (2007). Cherokee is also taught as a second-language in Northwest Georgia. [ Modern dialects ] Cherokee has three major dialects. The Lower dialect became extinct around 1900. The Middle or Kituhwa dialect is spoken by the Eastern band on the Qualla Boundary. The Overhill or Western dialect is spoken in Oklahoma. { Scancarelli, &quot; Native Languages &quot; p. 351 } The Overhill dialect has an estimated 9000 speakers. { Anderton, Alice, PhD. Status of Indian Languages in Oklahoma. Intertribal Wordpath Society. 2009 (retrieved 12 March 2009) } The Lower dialect spoken by the inhabitants of the Lower Towns in the vicinity of the South Carolina–Georgia border had r as the liquid consonant in its inventory, while both the contemporary Kituhwa or Ani-kituwah dialect spoken in North Carolina and the Overhill dialects contain l. As such, the word &quot; Cherokee &quot; when spoken in the language is expressed as Tsalagi (pronounced Jah-la-gee, Cha-la-gee, or Cha-la-g or TSA la gi by giduwa dialect speakers) by native speakers. [ Phonology ] Cherokee only has one labial consonant, m–which is relatively new to the language. The language thus lacks p and b. In the case of p, qu is often substituted (as in the name of Cherokee Wikipedia, Wi-gi-que-di-ya). [ Consonants ] The consonant inventory for North Carolina Cherokee is given in the table below. The consonants of all Iroquoian languages pattern so that they may be grouped as (oral) obstruents, sibilants, laryngeals, and resonants ( Lounsbury 1978 :337). Obstruents are non-distinctively aspirated when they precede h. There is some variation in how orthographies represent these allophones. The orthography used in the table represents the aspirated allophones as th, kh, and tsh. Another common orthography represents the unaspirated allophones as d, g, and dz and the aspirated allophones as t, k, and ts ( Scancarelli 2005 :359–62). The unaspirated plosives and affricate are optionally voiced intervocally. In other dialects, the affricate is a palatal (like ch in &quot; church &quot; ), and a lateral affricate (like tl in &quot; atlas &quot; ) may also be present. [ t ] [ k ] [ ʔ ] [ ts ] [ s ] [ h ] [ m ] [ n ] [ l ] [ j ] [ ɰ ] &lt; small &gt; North Carolina Cherokee consonants Labial Alveolar Palatal Velar Glottal Plosive Affricate Fricative Nasal Approximant (y) (w) [ Vowels ] There are six short vowels and six long vowels in the Cherokee inventory. As with all Iroquoian languages, this includes a nasalized vowel ( Lounsbury 1978 :337). In the case of Cherokee, the nasalized vowel is a schwa, which most orthographies represent as v and is pronounced [ [ɜ] ] as &quot; u &quot; in &quot; but &quot;; since it is nasal, it sounds rather like French un. Other vowels, when ending a word, are often nasalized. Vowels can be short or long. { Feeling, &quot; Dictionary, &quot; p. ix } [ i ] [ iː ] [ u ] [ uː ] [ e ] [ eː ] [ ə̃ ] [ ə̃ː ] [ o ] [ oː ] [ a ] [ aː ] Front Central Back Close     Mid       Open   [ Diphthongs ] Cherokee has only one diphthong native to the language: [ /ai/ ] ai   Another exception to the phonology above is the modern Oklahoma use of the loanword &quot; automobile, &quot; with the [ /ɔ/ ] sound and [ /b/ ] sound of English. [ Tone ] Cherokee is a pitch accent language with six tones, two of which are level (low, high) and the other four of which are contour (rising, falling, highfall, lowfall). { Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 49 } While the tonal system is undergoing a gradual simplification in many areas, it remains important in meaning and is still held strongly by many, especially older, speakers. The syllabary, however, does not display tone, and real meaning discrepancies are rare within the native-language Cherokee-speaking community. The same goes for transliterated Cherokee ( &quot; osiyo &quot;, &quot; dohitsu &quot;, etc.), which is rarely written with any tone markers, except in dictionaries. Native speakers can tell the difference between tone-distinguished words by context. [ Tone Inventory ] The tone name in the left-hand column displays the labels most recently used in studies of the language. The second represents the tone in standardized IPA. [ ˨ ] [ ˦ ] [ ˨˦ ] [ ˥˩ ] [ ˥˧ ] [ ˧˩ ] Tone Name IPA Low High Rising Falling Highfall Lowfall [ Tone Environments ] The high and low tones can appear on both long and short vowels in Cherokee, { Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 50 } and remain at the same pitch throughout the duration of the vowel sound. Contour tones in Cherokee appear only in underlying long vowels. { Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p.51 } At the ends of words in colloquial speech, there is a tendency to drop off a long vowel into a short vowel; this results in the highfall tone being produced as a high tone in faster speech. { Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p.52 } [ Highfall ] Highfall has a unique grammatical usage, primarily appearing with adjectives and adverbials along with most nouns derived from verbs. It only appears in verbs subordinate to another element of the sentence. When a highfall appears on a verb it changes the verbs&apos; role in the sentence, typically to one of four main categories: agentive derivation, modal, object derivation, or subordination. { Montgomery-Anderson, 2008, p. 54 } [ Grammar ] Cherokee, like many Native American languages, is polysynthetic, meaning that many morphemes may be linked together to form a single word, which may be of great length. Cherokee verbs, the most important word type, must contain as a minimum a pronominal prefix, a verb root, an aspect suffix, and a modal suffix. { Feeling et al, &quot; Verb &quot; p. 16 } For example, the verb form ge:ga, &quot; I am going, &quot; has each of these elements: Verb form ge:ga g- e: -g -a PRONOMINAL PREFIX VERB ROOT &quot; to go &quot; ASPECT SUFFIX MODAL SUFFIX The pronominal prefix is g-, which indicates first person singular. The verb root is -e, &quot; to go. &quot; The aspect suffix that this verb employs for the present-tense stem is -g-. The present-tense modal suffix for regular verbs in Cherokee is -a The following is a conjugation in the present tense of the verb to go. { Robinson, &quot; Conjugation &quot; p. 60 } Please note that there is no distinction between dual and plural in the 3rd person. Full conjugation of Root Verb-e- going Singular Dual incl. Dual excl. Plural excl. Plural incl. 1st ᎨᎦ gega - I&apos;m going ᎢᏁᎦ inega - We&apos;re going (you + I) ᎣᏍᏕᎦ osdega - We two are going (not you) ᎣᏤᎦ otsega - We&apos;re all going (3+, not you) ᎢᏕᎦ idega we&apos;re all going (3+, including you) 2nd ᎮᎦ hega - you&apos;re going ᏍᏕᎦ sdega - you two are going ᎢᏤᎦ itsega - you are all going 3rd ᎡᎦ ega - she/he/it&apos;s going ᎠᏁᎦ anega They are going The translation uses the present progressive ( &quot; at this time I am going &quot; ). Cherokee differentiates between progressive ( &quot; I am going &quot; ) and habitual ( &quot; I go &quot; ) more than English does. The forms ᎨᎪᎢ, ᎮᎪᎢ, ᎡᎪᎢ gegoi, hegoi, egoi represent &quot; I often/usually go &quot;, &quot; you often/usually go &quot;, and &quot; she/he/it often/usually goes &quot;, respectively. Verbs can also have prepronominal prefixes, reflexive prefixes, and derivative suffixes. Given all possible combinations of affixes, each regular verb can have 21,262 inflected forms. Cherokee does not make gender distinctions. For example, ᎦᏬᏂᎭ gawoniha can mean either &quot; she is speaking &quot; or &quot; he is speaking. &quot; { Feeling, &quot; Dictionary &quot; xiii } [ Shape classifiers in verbs ] Some Cherokee verbs require special classifiers which denote a physical property of the direct object. Only around 20 common verbs require one of these classifiers (such as the equivalents of &quot; pick up &quot;, &quot; put down &quot;, &quot; remove &quot;, &quot; wash &quot;, &quot; hide &quot;, &quot; eat &quot;, &quot; drag &quot;, &quot; have &quot;, &quot; hold &quot;, &quot; put in water &quot;, &quot; put in fire &quot;, &quot; hang up &quot;, &quot; be placed &quot;, &quot; pull along &quot; ). The classifiers can be grouped into five categories: 1. Live 2. Flexible (most common) 3. Long (narrow, not flexible) 4. Indefinite (solid, heavy relative to size) 5. Liquid (or container of) Example: Conjugation of &quot; Hand him... &quot; Classifier Type Cherokee Translation Live ᎯᎧᏏ hikasi Hand him (something living) Flexible ᎯᏅᏏ hinvsi Hand him (something like clothes, rope) Long, Indefinite ᎯᏗᏏ hidisi Hand him (something like a broom, pencil) Indefinite ᎯᎥᏏ hivsi Hand him (something like food, book) Liquid ᎯᏁᎥᏏ hinevsi Hand him (something like water) There have been reports that the youngest speakers of Cherokee are using only the Indefinite forms, suggesting a decline in the system of shape classification. [ Word order ] Simple declarative sentences usually have a subject-object-verb word order. [ Holmes Ruth Beginning Cherokee University of Oklahoma Press:Norman Cherokee Lesson 23 209 978-0-8061-1463-7 1977 1976 ] Negative sentences have a different word order. Adjectives come before nouns, as in English. Demonstratives, such as ᎾᏍᎩ nasgi ( &quot; that &quot; ) or ᎯᎠ hia ( &quot; this &quot; ), come at the beginning of noun phrases. Relative clauses follow noun phrases. { Feeling, &quot; Dictionary &quot; p. 353 } Adverbs precede the verbs that they are modifying. For example, &quot; she&apos;s speaking loudly &quot; is ᎠᏍᏓᏯ ᎦᏬᏂᎭ asdaya gawoniha (literally, &quot; loud she&apos;s-speaking &quot; ). A Cherokee sentence may not have a verb as when two noun phrases form a sentence. In such a case, word order is flexible. For example, Ꮎ ᎠᏍᎦᏯ ᎠᎩᏙᏓ na asgaya agidoda ( &quot; that man is my father &quot; ). A noun phrase might be followed by an adjective, such as in ᎠᎩᏙᏓ ᎤᏔᎾ agidoga utana ( &quot; my father is big &quot; ). { Feeling, &quot; Dictionary &quot; p. 354 } [ Writing system ] { New Echota, } { Georgia, 1828 } { Tahlequah, Oklahoma } [ Cherokee syllabary ] Cherokee is written in an 85-character syllabary invented by Sequoyah (also known as Guest or George Gist). Many of the letters resemble the Latin letters they derive from, but have completely different sound values; Sequoyah had seen English, Hebrew, and Greek writing but did not know how to read them. { Feeling, &quot; Dictionary &quot; xvii } Two other scripts used to write Cherokee are a simple Latin transliteration and a more precise system with diacritical marks. { Feeling et al, &quot; Verb &quot; pp. 1–2 } [ Books in Cherokee ] Awi Uniyvsdi Kanohelvdi ᎠᏫ ᎤᏂᏴᏍᏗ ᎧᏃᎮᎸᏗ: The Park Hill Tales.

[ Word creation ] Due to the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Some good examples are ditiyohihi (Cherokee:ᏗᏘᏲᎯᎯ) which means &quot; he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose. &quot; This is the Cherokee word for &quot; attorney. &quot; Another example is didaniyisgi (Cherokee:ᏗᏓᏂᏱᏍᎩ) which means &quot; the final catcher &quot; or &quot; he catches them finally and conclusively. &quot; This is the Cherokee word for &quot; policeman. &quot; { Holmes and Smith, p. vi } Many words, however, have been adopted from the English language – for example, gasoline, which in Cherokee is gasoline (Cherokee:ᎦᏐᎵᏁ). Many other words were adopted from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 1900s. One interesting and humorous example is the name of Nowata, Oklahoma. The word &quot; nowata &quot; is a Delaware word for &quot; welcome &quot; (more precisely the Delaware word is &quot; nuwita &quot; which can mean &quot; welcome &quot; or &quot; friend &quot; in the Delaware language ). The white settlers of the area used the name &quot; nowata &quot; for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware language, called the town Amadikanigvnagvna (Cherokee:ᎠᎹᏗᎧᏂᎬᎾᎬᎾ) which means &quot; the water is all gone gone from here &quot; – i.e. &quot; no water. &quot; { Holmes and Smith, p. vii } Other examples of adopted words are kawi (Cherokee:ᎧᏫ) for coffee and watsi (Cherokee:ᏩᏥ) for watch (which led to utana watsi (Cherokee:ᎤᏔᎾ ᏩᏥ) or &quot; big watch &quot; for clock). Meaning expansion can be illustrated by the words for &quot; warm &quot; and &quot; cold &quot;. They also mean &quot; south &quot; and &quot; north &quot; by an obvious extension. Around the time of the American Civil War, they were further extended to US party labels, Democratic and Republican, respectively. { Holmes and Smith, p. 43 } [ Language drift ] Drifted Otali Sequoyah Syllabary Mapping Otali Syllable Sequoyah Syllabary Index Sequoyah Syllabary Chart Sequoyah Syllable nah 32 Ꮐ nah hna 31 Ꮏ hna qua 38 Ꮖ qua que 39 Ꮗ que qui 40 Ꮘ qui quo 41 Ꮙ quo quu 42 Ꮚ quu quv 43 Ꮛ quv dla 60 Ꮬ dla tla 61 Ꮭ tla tle 62 Ꮮ tle tli 63 Ꮯ tli tlo 64 Ꮰ tlo tlu 65 Ꮱ tlu tlv 66 Ꮲ tlv tsa 67 Ꮳ tsa tse 68 Ꮴ tse tsi 69 Ꮵ tsi tso 70 Ꮶ tso tsu 71 Ꮷ tsu tsv 72 Ꮸ tsv hah 79 Ꮿ ya gwu 11 Ꭻ gu gwi 40 Ꮘ qui hla 61 Ꮭ tla hwa 73 Ꮹ wa gwa 38 Ꮖ qua hlv 66 Ꮲ tlv guh 11 Ꭻ gu gwe 39 Ꮗ que wah 73 Ꮹ wa hnv 37 Ꮕ nv teh 54 Ꮦ te qwa 06 Ꭶ ga yah 79 Ꮿ ya na 30 Ꮎ na ne 33 Ꮑ ne ni 34 Ꮒ ni no 35 Ꮓ no nu 36 Ꮔ nu nv 37 Ꮕ nv ga 06 Ꭶ ga ka 07 Ꭷ ka ge 08 Ꭸ ge gi 09 Ꭹ gi go 10 Ꭺ go gu 11 Ꭻ gu gv 12 Ꭼ gv ha 13 Ꭽ ha he 14 Ꭾ he hi 15 Ꭿ hi ho 16 Ꮀ ho hu 17 Ꮁ hu hv 18 Ꮂ hv ma 25 Ꮉ ma me 26 Ꮊ me mi 27 Ꮋ mi mo 28 Ꮌ mo mu 29 Ꮍ mu da 51 Ꮣ da ta 52 Ꮤ ta de 53 Ꮥ de te 54 Ꮦ te di 55 Ꮧ di ti 56 Ꮨ ti do 57 Ꮩ do du 58 Ꮪ du dv 59 Ꮫ dv la 19 Ꮃ la le 20 Ꮄ le li 21 Ꮅ li lo 22 Ꮆ lo lu 23 Ꮇ lu lv 24 Ꮈ lv sa 44 Ꮜ sa se 46 Ꮞ se si 47 Ꮟ si so 48 Ꮠ so su 49 Ꮡ su sv 50 Ꮢ sv wa 73 Ꮹ wa we 74 Ꮺ we wi 75 Ꮻ wi wo 76 Ꮼ wo wu 77 Ꮽ wu wv 78 Ꮾ wv ya 79 Ꮿ ya ye 80 Ᏸ ye yi 81 Ᏹ yi yo 82 Ᏺ yo yu 83 Ᏻ yu yv 84 Ᏼ yv to 57 Ꮩ do tu 58 Ꮪ du ko 10 Ꭺ go tv 59 Ꮫ dv qa 73 Ꮹ wa ke 07 Ꭷ ka kv 12 Ꭼ gv ah 00 Ꭰ a qo 10 Ꭺ go oh 03 Ꭳ o ju 71 Ꮷ tsu ji 69 Ꮵ tsi ja 67 Ꮳ tsa je 68 Ꮴ tse jo 70 Ꮶ tso jv 72 Ꮸ tsv a 00 Ꭰ a e 01 Ꭱ e i 02 Ꭲ i o 03 Ꭳ o u 04 Ꭴ u v 05 Ꭵ v s 45 Ꮝ s n 30 Ꮎ na l 02 Ꭲ i t 52 Ꮤ ta d 55 Ꮧ di y 80 Ᏸ ye k 06 Ꭶ ga g 06 Ꭶ ga There are two main dialects of Cherokee spoken by modern speakers. The Giduwa dialect (Eastern Band) and the Otali Dialect (also called the Overhill dialect) spoken in Oklahoma. The Otali dialect has drifted significantly from Sequoyah&apos;s syllabary in the past 150 years, and many contracted and borrowed words have been adopted into the language. These noun and verb roots in Cherokee, however, can still be mapped to Sequoyah&apos;s syllabary. In modern times, there are more than 85 syllables in use by modern Cherokee speakers. Modern Cherokee speakers who speak Otali employ 122 distinct syllables in Oklahoma. [ September 2009 ] [ Computer and smartphone usage ] For years, many people wrote transliterated Cherokee on the internet or used poorly compatible fonts to type out the syllabary. However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to Unicode, the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet. For example, the entire New Testament { Cherokee New Testament Online. Retrieved 12 August 2009. } is online in Cherokee Syllabary, and there is a Cherokee language Wikipedia featuring over 200 articles. { ᎤᎵᎮᎵᏍᏗ. Cherokee Wikipedia. Retrieved 12 March 2009. } Since 2003, all Apple computers come with a Cherokee font installed. { Cherokee language added to new iPhone and iPod software (retrieved 9 Sept 2010) } Cherokee Nation members Joseph L. Erb, Roy Boney, Jr., and Thomas Jeff Edwards worked with Apple to bring official Cherokee language support to the iPhone and iPod Touch in iOS 4.1 { Cherokee language available on iPhone and iPod Touch (retrieved 24 Sept 2010) } (released 8-Sept-2010) and for the iPad with iOS 4.2.1 (released 22-Nov-2010). Most Linux distributions support Cherokee input and display in any font containing the characters in Unicode environments. On March 25, 2011, Google announced the option to perform searches in Cherokee. { Search in Cherokee (retrieved 27 Mar 2011) } [ Cherokee language in popular culture ] The theme song &quot; I Will Find You &quot; { &quot; I Will Find You” on YouTube } from the 1992 film The Last of the Mohicans by the band Clannad features Máire Brennan singing in Cherokee as well as Mohican. { I Will Find You song lyrics.
