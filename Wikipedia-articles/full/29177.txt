The films were shot in inexpensive locales resembling the American Southwest, particularly in the Tabernas Desert in southeastern Spain, such as at the studios of Texas Hollywood, Mini Hollywood, and Western Leone. { http://www.click2mojacar.co.uk/western.htm } Other filming locations used were in central and southern Italy, such as the parks of Valle del Treja (between Rome and Viterbo ), the area of Camposecco (next to Camerata Nuova, characterized by a karst topography ), the hills around Castelluccio, the area around the Gran Sasso mountain, and the Tivoli &apos;s quarries and Sardinia. Typical themes in Spaghetti Westerns include the Mexican Revolution, often seen from a leftist political perspective (e.g., Damiano Damiani &apos;s A Bullet for the General, 1966; Sergio Corbucci &apos;s The Mercenary, 1968), a focus on revenge (e.g., Duccio Tessari &apos;s The Return of Ringo, 1966; Giorgio Ferroni &apos;s Blood for a Silver Dollar, 1965), the myth of the bounty hunter/bounty killer (e.g., Sergio Corbucci &apos;s The Great Silence, 1968; Robert Hossein &apos;s Cemetery Without Crosses, 1969), with the films often taking place on the border region shared by Mexico and the United States, a feature facilitated by the arid locations in which many of these films were shot (for example, Almeria in the southeast of Spain). [ History ] In 1958 an American-British western filmed in Spain, namely The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw (1958), directed by Raoul Walsh, was the first example of a spaghetti western. It was followed in 1961 by Savage Guns, this time a British-Spanish western, again filmed in Spain. This marked the beginning of Spain as a suitable film shooting location for any kind of European western. On the other hand, the American West as a dramatic setting in Italian productions goes back at least as far as Giacomo Puccini &apos;s 1910 opera La fanciulla del West; it is sometimes considered the first spaghetti western.

This was partly intentional and partly the context of a different cultural background. [ November 2009 ] Over six hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1980. Their settings include Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, as well as Mexico; many have the Mexican Revolution as a theme. [ Gaberscek Carlo Zapata Westerns: The Short Life of a Subgerne (1966–1972) Bilingual Review 29 2/3 2008 45–58 ] { Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 25 Apr. 2011. } In the 1960s, critics recognized that the American genres were rapidly changing. The genre most uniquely American, the Western, seemed to be evolving into a new rougher beast. For many critics, Sergio Leone &apos;s films were part of the problem. Leone&apos;s Dollars Trilogy (1964–1967) was neither the entirety nor the beginning of the &quot; spaghetti Western &quot; cycle in Italy, but for Americans Leone&apos;s films represented the true beginning of the Italian invasion of their privileged cultural form. Christopher Frayling, in his noted book on the Italian Western, describes American critical reception of the spaghetti Western cycle as, to &quot; a large extent, confined to a sterile debate about the &apos;cultural roots&apos; of the American/Hollywood Western. &quot; He remarks that few critics dared admit that they were, in fact, &quot; bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre. &quot; Pauline Kael, he notes, was willing to acknowledge this critical ennui and thus appreciate how a film such as Akira Kurosawa &apos;s Yojimbo (1961) &quot; could exploit Western conventions while debunking its morality. &quot; Frayling and other film scholars such as Bondanella argue that this revisionism was the key to Leone&apos;s success and, to some degree, to that of the spaghetti Western genre as a whole. [ Notable films ] [ List of Spaghetti Western films ] The first entirely Italian western movie was Il terrore dell&apos;Oklahoma (1959), directed by Mario Amendola. { Il terrore dell&apos;Oklahoma (The Internet Movie Database) } The best-known and perhaps archetypal Spaghetti westerns were directed by Sergio Leone and scored by Ennio Morricone : the &quot; Dollars Trilogy &quot; ( A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)) and Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).
