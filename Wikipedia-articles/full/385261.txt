Asked about what is preventing the a movement the size of Calvary Chapel, Smith emphatically answers, &quot; Me, &quot; and then clarifies how a relationally based movement was ensured &quot; by being fiercely independent and implanting this independence in them [the offspring churches]; by each of them incorporating independently; by not requiring reports; by keeping the affiliation [of churches] just a very loose affiliation. &quot; He states that there are no requirements, no calls, no letters from headquarters, unless there are major deviations from Calvary Chapel philosophy, at which point there might be a call from &quot; Dad &quot; to inquire what is going on. Calvary Chapel doctrine, if it can be called that, is simple. On many points there can be diversity of opinion so long as the centrality of scripture is maintained, along with such fundamental Christian beliefs as the deity of Christ and the resurrection of Jesus. ] Churches which affiliate with Calvary Chapel may use the name &quot; Calvary Chapel &quot; but need not do so. Beginning in 1965 in Southern California, this fellowship of churches grew out of Chuck Smith &apos;s Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa. Doctrinally, Calvary Chapel is evangelical, dispensational, pretribulationist, and believes in the principle of sola scriptura.

[ History ] [ September 2008 ] While Chuck Smith was still a member of a denominational church, he claimed that a prophecy came to him in which the Lord said to him that He was changing his name. His new name would mean &quot; Shepherd &quot; because the Lord was going to make him the shepherd of many flocks and the church would not be large enough to hold all of the people who would be flocking to hear the Word of God. { Smith, Chuck &amp; Tal Brooke (2003) Harvest. pp. 23.

Before Smith became their pastor, twelve of the 25 members attended a prayer meeting about whether or not to close their church: they reported that &quot; the Holy Spirit spoke to them through prophecy &quot; and told them that Smith would become their pastor, that he would want to elevate the platform area, that God would bless the church, that it would go on the radio, that the church would become overcrowded, and that he would become known throughout the world.

He said that He would lay a burden upon the heart of Chuck Smith to come and pastor. The Spirit said that Chuck wouldn&apos;t be happy with the church building. He would want to remodel it immediately, the platform area and all. God would bless the church and it would go on the radio. The church would become overcrowded. They would have to move to new quarters on the bluff overlooking the bay.

John then introduced Chuck to Lonnie Frisbee, the &quot; hippie evangelist &quot; who became a key figure in the growth of both the Jesus Movement and in Calvary Chapel.

Calvary Chapels hold the following views on the five points of Calvinism : [ Calvinism, Arminianism and the Word of God Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) The Word For Today 1993 http://www.calvarychapelblythewood.com/books/calvinismarminianismandth.pdf 2011-08-11 We believe that all are sinners (Romans 3:23) and unable by human performance to earn, deserve, or merit salvation (Titus 3:5). We believe that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and that apart from God&apos;s grace, no one can be saved (Ephesians 2:8–9). We believe that none are righteous, or capable of doing good (Romans 3:10–12), and that apart from the conviction and regeneration of the Holy Spirit, none can be saved (John 1:12–13; 16:8–11; I Peter 1:23–25).

We believe that God offers salvation to all who will call on His name. Romans 10:13 says, &quot; For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. &quot; We also believe that God calls to Himself those who will believe in His Son, Jesus Christ (I Corinthians 1:9). However, the Bible also teaches that an invitation (or call) is given to all, but that only a few will accept it. We see this balance throughout scripture. Revelation 22:17 states, &quot; And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. &quot; I Peter 1:2 tells us we are, &quot; elect according to the foreknowledge of God, the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. &quot; Matthew 22:14 says, &quot; For many are called, but few are chosen (elected). &quot; God clearly does choose, but man must also accept God&apos;s invitation to salvation. ] [ Calvinism, Arminianism and the Word of God Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) The Word For Today 1993 http://www.calvarychapelblythewood.com/books/calvinismarminianismandth.pdf 2011-08-11 We believe that Jesus Christ died as a propitiation (a satisfaction of the righteous wrath of God against sin) &quot; for the whole world &quot; (I John 2:2; 4:9–10), and that He redeems and forgives all who will believe in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as their only hope of salvation from sin, death, and hell (Ephesians 1:7; I Peter 1:18–19). We believe that eternal life is a gift of God (Romans 6:23), and that &quot; whosoever believeth &quot; in Jesus Christ will not perish, but will have eternal life (John 3:16–18). I Timothy 4:10 says &quot; we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, specially of those that believe. &quot; Hebrews 2:9 states that Jesus, &quot; was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man. &quot; The atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ was clearly sufficient to save the entire human race. ] [ Calvinism, Arminianism and the Word of God Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) The Word For Today 1993 http://www.calvarychapelblythewood.com/books/calvinismarminianismandth.pdf 2011-08-11 In Stephen&apos;s message in Acts 7:51, he concluded by saying, &quot; Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye. &quot; In Romans 10:21, the apostle Paul quotes Isaiah 65:2 when he speaks of God&apos;s words to Israel, &quot; All day long I have stretched forth My hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. &quot; In one of the five warning passages of the book of Hebrews, we read in Hebrews 10:26, &quot; For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins. &quot; Verse 29 adds, &quot; Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? &quot; Clearly, God&apos;s grace can either be resisted or received by the exercise of human free will. ] [ Calvinism, Arminianism and the Word of God Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) The Word For Today 1993 http://www.calvarychapelblythewood.com/books/calvinismarminianismandth.pdf 2011-08-11 We believe that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 8:38–39), and that there is no condemnation to those who are in Jesus Christ (Romans 8:1). We believe that the promise of Jesus in John 10:27–28 is clear: &quot; My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand. &quot; Jesus said in John 6:37, &quot; him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out. &quot; We have this assurance in Philippians 1:6 &quot; Being confident of this very thing, that He who hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. &quot; We believe that the Holy Spirit has sealed us unto the day of redemption (Ephesians 1:13–14; 4:30). But we also are deeply concerned over the words of Jesus in Matthew 7:21–23 ] Regarding total depravity, Calvary Chapel affirms that &quot; apart from God&apos;s grace, no one can be saved, &quot; and that &quot; mankind is clearly fallen and lost in sin. &quot; Regarding unconditional election, Calvary Chapel affirms that God, &quot; based on his foreknowledge, has predestined the believer, &quot; and that &quot; God clearly does choose, but man must also accept God&apos;s invitation to salvation. &quot; Regarding limited atonement, Calvary Chapel affirms that Jesus died &quot; for the whole world &quot; and that the &quot; atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ was clearly sufficient to save the entire human race. &quot; Regarding irresistible grace, Calvary Chapel affirms that &quot; God&apos;s grace can either be resisted or received by the exercise of human free will &quot;. Calvary Chapels &quot; believe in the perseverance of the saints (true believers) but are deeply concerned about sinful lifestyles and rebellious hearts among those who call themselves &apos;Christians&apos;. &quot; [ Spiritual gifts ] Although Calvary Chapel believes in the continuing efficacy of the gift of tongues, it does not recognize uninterpreted tongues spoken in a congregational setting as necessarily inspired (or at least directed) by the Holy Spirit because of its understanding of [ 1 Corinthians 14 NRSV ]. Calvary Chapel accepts that the Bible affirms interpreted tongues and modern prophecy. Practicing tongues in private occurs more commonly. [ Charisma vs. Charismania Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) http://www3.calvarychapel.com/library/smith-chuck/books/cvc.htm 0-936728-49-3 Word for Today 1993 ] Calvary Chapel does not teach that the outward manifestation of every Christian counts as speaking in tongues. Instead, the movement&apos;s theologians regard speaking in tongues as one of the many gifts of the Spirit and see believers as blessed as the Spirit moves.

The first is that which is experienced prior to conversion. In this relationship the Holy Spirit is convicting the person of his sin.

He begins that work in us of transforming us into the image of Jesus Christ. ] The third relationship is the baptism of the Holy Spirit which Calvary Chapel believes is for the purpose of being a Christian witness. [ Baptism and Communion ] Calvary Chapels practice believer&apos;s baptism by immersion. Calvary Chapel does not regard baptism as necessary for salvation, but instead sees it as an outward sign of an inward change. As a result, the Chapels do not baptize infants, although they may dedicate them to God. Calvary Chapel views Communion in a symbolic way, with reference to [ 1 Corinthians 11:23–26 NRSV ]. [ Eschatology ] Calvary Chapels strongly espouse pretribulationist and premillennialist views in their eschatology (the study of the end times ). They believe that the rapture of the Church will occur first, followed by a literal seven-year period of Great Tribulation, followed by the second coming of Jesus Christ, and then finally a literal thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ on earth called the Millennial Kingdom. Calvary Chapel also rejects supersessionism and instead believes that the Jews remain God&apos;s chosen people and that Israel will play an important part in the end times. [ Calvary Chapel Distinctives Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) The Word For Today 1993 http://www3.calvarychapel.com/library/smith-chuck/books/ccd.htm The Rapture Of The Church ] Interest in one event during the Tribulation —the building of a Third Temple in Jerusalem —led in the early 1980s to associations between some in Calvary Chapel (including Chuck Smith) and Jewish groups interested in seeing the temple rebuilt.

In the early 1980s, Chuck Smith, a noted evangelist and minister of Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, California, one of the largest and most dynamic Charismatic churches in America (on Smith, see Miller), invited Stanley Goldfoot to lecture in his church, and Smith’s followers helped to finance Goldfoot’s activity. Chuck Smith’s involvement in the rebuilding of the Temple is demonstrative of the constituency of Christians interested in the Temple and the prospect of its rebuilding. ] [ Return of Christ in 1981 ] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Chuck Smith wrote and published a prophetic timeline that declared: [ End Times: A Report on Future Survival Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) 1978 Maranatha House Publishers 0-89337-011-8 35 Jesus taught us that the generation which sees the &quot; budding of the fig tree, &quot; the birth of the nation Israel, will be the generation that sees the Lord&apos;s return. I believe that the generation of 1948 is the last generation. Since a generation of judgment is forty years and the Tribulation period lasts seven years, I believe the Lord could come back for His Church any time before the Tribulation starts, which would mean anytime before 1981.

End Times: A Report on Future Survival, Chuck Smith, 1978 The reasoning had to do with the idea that the 7-year Tribulation would end in 1988, forty years after the establishment of the state of Israel. In his 1978 book, Chuck reasoned that Haley&apos;s Comet in 1986 would result in problems for those left behind: &quot; The Lord said that towards the end of the Tribulation period the sun would scorch men who dwell upon the face of the earth (Rev. 16). The year 1986 would fit just about right! We’re getting close to the Tribulation and the return of Christ in glory. All the pieces of the puzzle are coming together. &quot; Disappointment resulting from the prophecy not materializing in 1981 caused some to leave the church. { Gorenberg, Gershom.

[ Practices ] Calvary Chapel pastors tend to prefer expositional sermons rather than topical ones, and they will often give their sermons sequentially from the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. They believe that expository preaching allows the congregation to learn how all parts of the Bible address issues as opposed to topical sermons which they see as allowing preachers to emphasize certain issues more than others. [ Calvary Chapel Distinctives Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) The Word For Today 1993 http://www3.calvarychapel.com/library/smith-chuck/books/ccd.htm The Priority of the Word Topical sermons are good, and they have their place, but when you&apos;re preaching topically, you&apos;re prone by nature to preach only those topics that you like.... If you&apos;re only preaching topically, you may also tend to avoid controversial or difficult topics, and the people won&apos;t gain a well-balanced view of God&apos;s truth. ] Another advantage, they say, is that it makes difficult topics easier to address because members of the congregation won&apos;t feel like they are being singled out. [ Calvary Chapel Distinctives Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) The Word For Today 1993 http://www3.calvarychapel.com/library/smith-chuck/books/ccd.htm The Priority of the Word Another advantage of teaching the whole counsel of God is that when you come to difficult issues that deal with problems in an individual&apos;s life or within the Church body, you can address them straightforwardly. we need not worry about people thinking, &apos;Oh, he&apos;s aiming at me today.&apos; People in the congregation know that it&apos;s simply the passage of of Scripture being studied that day. So it can&apos;t be, &apos;Oh man, he&apos;s really picking on me, &quot; because they realize that you&apos;re going straight through the Book, and you&apos;re not jumping from topic to topic. We&apos;re just going straight through the entire Word of God. ] { Another advantage, they say, is that it makes difficult topics easier to address because members of the congregation won&apos;t feel like they are being singled out.}} } It sees expository teaching as providing consistent teaching that, over time, brings the &quot; perfecting of the saints &quot; which is part of their general philosophy for the Church. [ Calvary Chapel Distinctives Smith Chuck Chuck Smith (pastor) The Word For Today 1993 http://www3.calvarychapel.com/library/smith-chuck/books/ccd.htm The Priority of the Word ] In teaching expositorily through scripture sequentially, Calvary Chapel believes God sets the agenda, not the pastor. Calvary Chapels believe that most churches have a &quot; dependent, highly organized, [and] structured &quot; environment, but that most people want an &quot; independent and casual way of life &quot;. Calvary churches typically have a casual and laid-back atmosphere.

Praise and worship usually consists of upbeat contemporary Christian music though many Calvarys also play hymns. The style of worship generally reflects the region and the specific make-up of the congregation. Calvary Chapel does not have a formalized system of church membership. Calling a Calvary Chapel one&apos;s church usually means regularly attending church services and becoming involved in fellowship with other &quot; members &quot; of the church. [ Organization ] The form of church government practiced by Calvary Chapel does not conform to any of the three historical forms. They do not employ congregational polity, believing that God&apos;s people collectively made poor decisions in the Old Testament, citing [ Exodus 16:2 NRSV ] as an example. They also criticize presbyterian polity because when &quot; the pastor is hired by the board and can be fired by the board, &quot; they fear that &quot; the pastor becomes a hireling &quot;. Although Calvary Chapel&apos;s governance shares a similarity with episcopal polity in that the congregation has no direct authority over the pastor, it does not have the formal hierarchy characteristic of episcopal polity. The majority of Calvary Chapels have adopted models of government based on their understanding of the theocracy that God established in the Old Testament they sometimes call the &quot; Moses model &quot;. In this system, God was head of his people and under God&apos;s authority was Moses, who led the Israelites as God directed him. Moses also had a priesthood and seventy elders providing him support. Calvary Chapel has adapted this order believing their pastors have a role like Moses and their boards of elders function in supporting roles.

They do not have church membership apart from pastors recognized through their affiliate program. The Calvary Chapel Outreach Fellowship (CCOF) has the responsibility of affiliating churches with Calvary Chapel. A church that affiliates with Calvary Chapel often (but not always) uses the name &quot; Calvary Chapel &quot;. Three requirements for becoming affiliated exist: [ http://www.ccofweb.com/ Calvary Chapel Outreach Fellowship Introduction 2006-04-15 ] the pastor must &quot; embrace the characteristics of the Calvary Chapel movement as described in Calvary Chapel Distinctives &quot; the church must have the characteristics of a church (as opposed to a less-developed home fellowship) an applicant must express willingness to spend the time to fellowship with other Calvary Chapels The requirements do not include a seminary degree. In accordance with Calvary&apos;s interpretation and understanding of the Bible (see 1 Timothy 3:2 and 1 Timothy 3:12 ), Calvary Chapel does not ordain women or homosexuals as pastors. Regional lead pastor s exercise a measure of accountability. [ http://www.ccofweb.com/missionstatement.htm Calvary Chapel Outreach Fellowship Mission Statement 2006-04-15 http://web.archive.org/web/20060404055418/http%3A//ccofweb.com/missionstatement.htm 2006-04-04 ] Since no legal or financial ties link the different Calvary Chapels, only disaffiliation can serve as a disciplinary procedure. [ Criticisms ] Various criticisms of the organization and of the pastorate role in the organization exist. For example, journalist David Templeton described intense peer pressure during his time as an active participant in Calvary Chapel ministry. [ Templeton David Losing My Religion http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/04.02.98/calvary-9813.html 24 July 2011 Sonoma County Independent April 2-8, 1998 ] Chuck Smith has been criticized for drawing connections between disasters (e.g., earthquakes, the September 11 attacks ) and divine wrath against homosexuality and abortion. [ Lobdell William In Aftermath of Attacks, Talk of &apos;End Days&apos; Soars http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/22/local/me-48633 1 August 2011 Los Angeles Times 22 September 2001 ] Calvary Chapel leaders, including Smith, are the subject of a currently pending lawsuit alleging that they knew or should have known that a minister named Anthony Iglesias was prone to sexual abuse when they moved him from ministry positions in Diamond Bar, California, to Thailand, to Post Falls, Idaho. { Arellano, Gustavo 2011. Lawsuit claims Calvary Chapel allowed shuffling of pedophile employee from Diamond Bar to Idaho, } { OC Weekly. Published 23 August 2011. Retrieved 19 September 2011. } Iglesias was convicted of lewd conduct with two 14-year-old boys in California in 2004, and the current lawsuit stems from events in Idaho, but all alleged abuse occurred in or before 2003. { Graman, Kevin 2011. Churches protected predator, suit says, } { The Spokesman-Review. Published 16 April 2011. Retrieved 19 September 2011. } [ Accountability of the pastorate system ] As a result of what he saw as micromanaging church elders and board members, Chuck Smith used &quot; an independent board of elders &quot; when he took the senior pastor role at Calvary Chapel. Smith subsequently wrote that &quot; senior pastors should be answerable to God, not to a denominational hierarchy or board of elders &quot;. Christianity Today says that Smith&apos;s &quot; Moses Model &quot;, in which senior pastors do not permit their authority to be challenged, can lead to churches that are often resistant to accountability. In response, Smith says he is following the authority structure that God used when Israel was under the rule of Moses.

Moll Rob 2007-02-16 2010-03-14 Christianity Today ] According to one article, &quot; Smith&apos;s book Calvary Chapel Distinctives teaches that senior pastors should be answerable to God, not to a denominational hierarchy or board of elders. &quot; &quot; Critics say this &apos;Moses model&apos; produces pastors who refuse to let their authority be challenged. Such pastors often resist accountability measures such as financial audits and providing detailed financial statements. Some curious Calvary Chapel attendees, who have sought financial information from their churches, say they were ostracized. &quot; [ Ministries ] [ Bible college ] [ Calvary Chapel Bible College ] Technically, Calvary Chapel has only one Bible college : Calvary Chapel Bible College (CCBC), located in Murrieta, California. However, this school also has at least 50 affiliated campuses throughout the world.

We believe that the credibility of CCBC is not in accreditation, but in the fruitfulness and surrendered lives of the students who have attended. ] [ Harvest Crusades ] [ Harvest Crusade ] Harvest Crusades operate as a ministry of Harvest Christian Fellowship (a Calvary Chapel in Riverside, California ). They carry out an evangelistic ministry similar to Billy Graham &apos;s. They meet in stadiums and have Christian music bands play followed by an evangelical message normally given by Greg Laurie. They estimate three million people have attended since its inception in 1990. [ Harvest Crusades http://www.harvest.org/crusades/index.php/137.html 2006-04-19 ] [ Broadcasting ] Several radio stations are operated by Calvary Chapel churches.
