It was first released in South Korea on 31 August 2002 for Microsoft Windows and has since been released in many other locales around the world. The game has spawned an animated series, Ragnarok the Animation, and a sequel game, Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second, is in development. Player characters exist in a world with a player environment that gradually changes with the passage of time. Major changes in the features and history of the world take place as episodes in the RO timeline. Player characters interact in a 3D environment but are represented by 2D character sprites for front, back, side and diagonal facings. The major types of server-supported gameplay are Player vs Environment, Guild vs Guild, Player vs Player. Also supported by the game server are Group vs Group, Arena Combat, Player vs Monster, Player vs All, and various other specific scenarios at designated instance locations in the game world. NPC-run challenges and contests are also available with prizes, awards, and/or listing in a specific hall of fame listing. [ Setting ] An event taking place in Morroc, a desert town Ragnarok Online is divided into a series of maps on two major continents, each of which has its own terrain and native monsters, though many monsters are present in multiple regions. Transportation between maps requires loading the new map and monsters are unable to travel from one map to another unless directly associated with the player such as a pet, mount, or hireling. There are three major nations in Ragnarok Online, the first of which and where all players start is the kingdom of Rune Midgard. The Schwaltzvalt Republic, an industrialized neighbor to the North, was added in Episode 10 [ iRO staff Schwaltzvalt Republic - Part 2. Einbroch, the City of Steel Gravity Interactive LLC http://iro.ragnarokonline.com/News/Notice/NoticeView.asp?noticeSeqNo%3D47%26amp%3BPage%3D1%26amp%3BKeyWord%3D%26amp%3BmNum%3D4 ] and Arunafeltz, a religious nation is the subject of Episode 11. [ Episode 11.1 Rachel RO Future Wiki http://ro.doddlercon.com/wiki/index.php?title%3DEpisode_11.1_Rachel ] Areas from Norse mythology are included, such as Niflheim, the land of the dead, and Valhalla, where players can become Transcendent Classes. New map content is constantly being added to game in the form of Episode updates. The official Ragnarok Online servers underwent massive game system changes in 2010, which has been titled &quot; Renewal &quot;. Renewal revamped game mechanics, changed the behaviour and interaction of stats, gears, and modifiers in the stat system, changed the way and amount of character experience, and introduced the 3rd Job Classes. There are various other changes that come with Renewal, including interface and hotkey alterations, as well as skill changes. Renewal has different versions, according to the server it is being implemented in. The 2 major versions are called the kRO ( Korea n Ragnarok Online) and jRO ( Japan ese Ragnarok Online), titled after the server in which the version was created. The differences between each version were made by the corresponding branch of Gravity in order to please their players, rather than having an overall brand of Renewal, which might only please a minority. [ Job system ] [ June 2010 ] &quot; Jobs &quot; are one of the most important aspects of Ragnarok Online. The job a player chooses will determine his or her strengths and weaknesses both in a party and outside of one. The job system initially consisted of 13 classes, which has increased to over 50 via several updates. Each class specializes in certain skills corresponding to archetypes in a role-playing game. Additionally, numerous equipment are exclusive to particular classes.The greatness of the equipment depends on the character attribute status. All players start as a &quot; novice &quot;. As the name implies, the novice is a tutorial job that allows a new player to get the general feel of the game. Upon reaching a certain level which is dependant on their desired &apos;job&apos;, a player has 3 options: he/she can change into one of six &quot; first classes &quot; choose one of the &quot; expanded classes &quot;, or become a &quot; Super Novice &quot;. After increasing their &apos;player level&apos; and &apos;job level&apos; to a specific amount, first class characters can advance into their &apos;second class&apos;. It should be noted that each separate class allows two options for the second class change. For example, the &apos;Swordsman&apos; class can become either a &apos;Knight&apos; or a &apos;Crusader&apos;. Once a player reaches player level 99 and job level 50, they can &apos;rebirth&apos; their character (not applicable to expansion classes and Super Novices). Rebirthing brings a character back to level 1 for both player level and job level. Reborn characters generally work the same as regular characters up until the second class. Instead of a second class, characters that are born can transcend to a new second job, different to those of a character that hasn&apos;t been reborn. These transcended job types have more skills and a larger number of &apos;stat points&apos; to allocate to characters compared to second classes. The experience curve for transcendent jobs is significantly higher. A player will evolve and change jobs multiple times over the course of playing, though the number of changes will be determined by choices made by the player.

The game&apos;s music spans a wide variety of genre s and musical styles, including trance, techno, jazz, rock, and orchestral. New tracks are added to the soundtrack as with every new area added to the game world. &quot; The memory of RAGNAROK &quot; Ragnarok Online Original Sound Track is a best-of soundtrack album featuring background music in addition to remixes and vocal arrangements of certain pieces. The game&apos;s official theme song, &quot; You &amp; I, &quot; is also included. It was developed bySoundTeMP and released by Gravity in 2006. The album features vocal arrangements of certain pieces, performed by Lee Seung-Yeon, Lee Jeong-Hee and Seo Ji-Hae. The album&apos;s booklet features text in Korean, Chinese, English, and Japanese.

This has led to a multitude of regional differences in the game, such as localized or translated text, special in-game events, and the payment model. [ P2P servers ] This is the original payment model pay to play. Depending on the version, users can pay by a monthly subscription or buy pre-paid cards. The iRO (International Ragnarok Online) server has switched completely to the F2P model supported by revenue from the in-game Kafra Shop. [ Kafra Shop ] Microtransaction s and virtual freemium shops have become an increasingly favored revenue stream over monthly subscriptions for online multiplayer games, especially in the Asian MMO market. As such, the Kafra Shop (an Item Mall) was added to the RO servers. Users are able to purchase Kafra Credit Points with local currency; the points can then be exchanged for items available only in the Kafra Shop. To avoid the negative perception of players buying their way to success, weapons and armors are not sold in the Kafra Shop with the exception of some fashionable or collectible hats which may have a small armor value so that they may continue to be worn as as a compromise between normal headgear armor and fashion-statement hat accessories. Also, players can continue playing all the way to level 99, wear gears, train all applicable levels of their job class, and compete in events without ever purchasing from the Kafra Shop. This service appears on most other localized servers of Ragnarok Online such as jRO (Japanese Ragnarok Online), mRO (Malaysian Ragnarok Online), pRO (Philippine Ragnarok Online), rRO (Russian Ragnarok Online) and kRO (Korean Ragnarok Online), using the currency of the respective countries for points. In addition, upgraded forms of normal equipment can be rented using Kafra Points. [ iRO staff Kafra Shop Gravity Interactive LLC http://iro.ragnarokonline.com/kafrashop/itemmallguide.asp ] [ F2P servers ] There are official &quot; Free To Play &quot; servers where players can play Ragnarok Online free of charge, with a few differences in game play. Major differences are the limited use of the Kafra Teleport service, upgrading weapons and armor never have a &quot; safe zone &quot; in which the player cannot break the Weapon/Armor, items have had their costs changed or been removed entirely from the game, the Acolyte skill Teleport has been modified, and prices on certain NPC items received a moderate increase. Notably, characters may be any job class, access any map, attain all skills, wear any gear, and progress to all levels without payment of microtransaction fees. Changes vary from server to server. Some free to play servers also provide premium account plans with various ingame benefits. The use of free servers has resulted in a higher reliance on the Kafra Shop item mall for revenue stream. Many localized versions of Ragnarok Online have implemented free servers during 2007-2008. [ Gravity Corporation press release GRAVITY Reports Fiscal Year 2008 Results PRN Wire http://www.pressreleasenetwork.com/newsroom/news_view.phtml?news_id%3D2803 ] [ Ragnarok Mobile ] Gravity Co. Ltd. released 8 separate games for the mobile phone allowing players to experience the game on the road. [ iRO staff Ragnarok Mobile Mage Gravity Interactive LLC http://iro.ragnarokonline.com/mobile/intro.asp ] Each version focuses on the main aspect of the super novice, acolyte, thief, merchant, mage, archer, gunslinger, taekwon, ninja, and swordman class based on the version of the game they have. Players are able to advance their characters using the attributes STR, AGI, VIT, LUK, INT, and DEX. Though not placed in the server, players control their character and complete a series of quests or tasks. As players earn zeny, (the in-game currency ), they are able to send the zeny to their real accounts. Along with that, a ranking is present where characters are ranked by the amount of zeny the character has.
