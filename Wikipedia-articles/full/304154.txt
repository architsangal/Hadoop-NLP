[ Name ] The name El Hierro, although phonetically identical to the Spanish word for &apos;iron&apos;, is generally thought to be derived instead from one of several words in the Guanche language of the pre-Hispanic inhabitants, known as Bimbache s. Juan de Abreu Galindo (in a manuscript translated and published by George Glas in 1764) gives the native name of the island as Esero (or &apos;&apos;Eseró&apos;&apos; ), meaning &apos;strong&apos;. According to Abreu Galindo, the Bimbaches, not having iron originally, called the strong metal of the Spanish alternately by their own word for &apos;strong&apos; and by its Spanish name, hierro, and from there transferred the alternation of names to their island.

Dodsley London 24–25 ] Richard Henry Major, however, in notes on his translation of &apos;&apos;Le Canarien&apos;&apos;, observes that the Guanche word hero or herro, meaning &apos;cistern&apos;, could easily have lapsed into hierro by a process of folk etymology. [ The Canarian Bontier Pierre Le Verrier Jean 1872 Burt Franklin New York 124 ] It is believed that the Bimbaches had to construct cisterns to save fresh rainwater. The Gran diccionario guanche [ Gran diccionario guanche : el diccionario de la lengua de los aborígenes canarios Osorio Acevedo Francisco 2003 Centro de la Cultura Popular Canaria Tenerife ] gives the meaning of the Guanche word hero in Spanish as &quot; fuente &quot; (&apos;spring [water source]&apos;). The association with iron is evident in the names of the island in other languages as early as the 18th century: Portuguese Ferro, French l&apos;île de Fer, [ Essais sur les Îles Fortunées et l&apos;antique Atlantide, ou Précis de l&apos;Histoire générale de l&apos;Archipel des Canaries Bory de St.-Vincent J.B.G.M.

[ History ] The ancient natives of the island, called Bimbaches, were conquered by Jean de Béthencourt –more through the process of negotiation than by military action. Béthencourt had as his ally and negotiator Augeron, brother of the island&apos;s native monarch. Augeron had been captured years previously by the Europeans and now served as mediator between the Europeans and the Guanches. In return for control over the island, Béthencourt promised to respect the liberty of the natives, but he eventually broke his promise, selling many of the bimbaches into slavery. Many Frenchmen and Galicians subsequently settled on the island. There was a revolt of the natives against the harsh treatment of the governor Lázaro Vizcaíno, but it was suppressed. [ Geography, flora and fauna ] In 2000, El Hierro was designated by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve, with 60% of its territory protected to preserve its natural and cultural diversity. [ Biosphere Reserve Information, Spain, Isla de El Hierro http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode%3Dall%26amp%3Bcode%3DSPA%2B16 ] Like the rest of the Canary Islands chain, El Hierro is sharply mountainous and volcanic, only one eruption has ever been recorded on the island from the Volcan de Lomo Negro vent in 1793. The eruption lasted a month. El Hierro is a 278.5  km 2 island, formed approx 1.2 million year ago { Juan Carlos Carracedo, Simon Day: Canary Islands. Classic Geology in Europe 4. Harpenden, Terra, 2002, Page 2 ISBN 978-1-903544-07-5 } after three successive eruptions, the island emerged from the ocean as a triangle of basalt ic dykes topped with a volcanic cone more than 2,000 metres high. [ El Hierro. Geología http://www.elhierro.es/index.php?item%3D00000032 Spanish ] With continued activity resulting in the island expanding to have the largest number of volcano es in the Canaries (over 500 cones, another 300 covered by more recent deposits), together with approximately 70 caves and volcanic galleries, including the Cueva de Don Justo whose collection of channels is over 6  km in length. Landslides have reduced the size and height of the island. The current highest point is situated in the middle of the island, in Malpaso, 1501 meters high. [ Landslides and tsunami ] There is evidence of at least three major landslides that have affected El Hierro in the last few hundred thousand years. [ Masson D.G. Watts A.B., Gee M.J.R., Urgeles R., Mitchell N.C., Le Bas T.P. &amp; Canals M. 2002 Slope failures on the flanks of the western Canary Islands Earth-Science Reviews Elsevier 57 1-2 1–35 10.1016/S0012-8252(01)00069-1 http://geomar.geo.ub.es/eurodom/documents/Massonetal01_ESR.pdf 29 August 2011 ] The most recent of these was the &apos;El Golfo&apos; landslide that occurred about 15 thousand years ago, involving collapse of the northern flank of the island. The landslide formed the El Golfo valley and created a debris avalanche with a volume of 150 –180  km 3. Turbidite deposits related to this landslide have been recognized in drill cores from the Agadir Basin to the north of the Canary Islands. [ Masson D.G. Harbitz C.B., Wynn R.B., Pedersen G. &amp; Løvholt 2006 Submarine landslides: processes, triggers and hazard prediction Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A Royal Society London 364 1845 2009–2039 10.1098/rsta.2006.1810 http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1845/2009.full 29 August 2011 ] Detailed analysis of these deposits suggests that the slope failure did not occur as a single event but a series of smaller failures over a period of hours or days. Local tsunami are likely to have been triggered by these landslides but no evidence has been found to confirm this.

By the end of September, the tremors had increased in frequency and intensity, with experts fearing landslides affecting the town of La Frontera, and also a small possibility of a volcanic eruption through a new vent. Emergency services evacuated several families in the areas at most risk, and made plans to evacuate the island if necessary.

[ Tourism and transportation ] Like all of the Canary Islands, El Hierro is a tourist destination. It is served by a small airport, El Hierro Airport at Valverde and a ferry terminal, both of which connect to Tenerife. [ Political organization ] The island is part of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and includes three municipalities: Frontera Valverde El Pinar Valverde is situated in the northeast and Frontera in the southwest, both contain several villages. The seat of the island government (cabildo insular) is in the town of Valverde, which houses approximately half of the island&apos;s population. [ The &quot; Meridian Island &quot; ] [ Ferro Meridian ] { Part of map of } { Upper Silesia (1746) with Latin message: &apos;&apos;Longitudines numeratæ à primo Meridiano per &apos;&apos;&apos;Ins&apos;&apos;&apos;[ula] &apos;&apos;&apos;Ferri&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; } El Hierro was known in European history as the prime meridian in common use outside of the future British Empire. Already in the 2nd century A.D., Ptolemy considered a definition of the zero meridian based on the western-most position of the known world, giving maps with only positive (eastern) longitudes. In the year 1634, France ruled by Louis XIII and Richelieu decided that Ferro&apos;s meridian should be used as the reference on maps, since this island was considered the most western position of the Old World. ( Flores Island lies further west, but the Azores were not discovered by Europeans until early 15th century, and their identification as part of the Old World is uncertain.) It was thought to be exactly 20 degrees west of the Paris meridian, so indeed the exact position of Ferro was never considered. Old maps (outside of Anglo-America) often have a common grid with Paris degrees at the top and Ferro degrees offset by 20 at the bottom. Louis Feuillée also worked on this problem in 1724. [ Energy ] Assembly of the first of five wind turbines with 2,5 MW each. According to the Ministry for Industry, Tourism and Commerce, El Hierro will become the first island in the world to be energy self-sufficient. This will be achieved through a €54 million project combining a greater than 11 megawatt wind farm and two hydroelectric projects.

Tiny Spanish Island Has a Huge Stake in the Future, New York Times, 19 January 2011; NYTimes.com website, 20 January 2011; &amp; } { International Herald Tribune, 19 January 2011. } The project, created by the local Gorona del Viento El Hierro consortium with financial aid from the European Union, will construct five wind turbine s of type E-70 capable of producing 11.5 megawatts of wind power to supply electricity for approximately 11,000 residents, an additional number of tourists, and three water desalination facilities. The hybrid wind/pumped hydro storage system will store surplus wind power by pumping water up 700 meters (approximately 2,300 feet) to fill the crater of an extinct volcano. When winds are calm or when demand exceeds supply, water will be released from the crater to generate 11.3 MW of electricity, filling an artificial basin created at the bottom of the extinct volcano. Water in the lower basin is then pumped back up again to the upper reservoir when there is excess wind power. The closed-loop hybrid wind/hydro system, to be tested by the end of 2012, is expected to save approximately US$4M per year (calculated with January 2011 oil prices) currently spent on about 40,000 barrels of crude oil imported annually, and will make the island completely self-sufficient for electrical energy. [ El Hierro in literature ] The island of Hierro is mentioned in Umberto Eco &apos;s novel &quot; The Island of the Day Before &quot; ( &quot; L&apos;isola del giorno prima &quot;, 1994), a novel about a 17th century Italian nobleman trapped on an island on the International Date Line.
