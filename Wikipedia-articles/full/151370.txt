[ May 2012 ] [ BOAC For other uses, see Boac ] [ British Overseas Airways Corporation BOAC.svg BA BA SPEEDBIRD 24 November 1939 31 March 1974 (merged with British European Airways to form British Airways ) London Heathrow Airport ~200 (at its peak) Speedbird House, London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom ] British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) was the British state airline created in 1940 from the merger of Imperial Airways and British Airways Ltd. In the Civil Aviation Act of 1946, the state-owned British European Airways (BEA) and British South American Airways (BSAA) were formed, and the full name British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) was finally applied and accepted throughout the Corporation. BOAC absorbed BSAA in 1949, but BEA operated the UK&apos;s domestic and European routes for the next quarter century. A 1971 Act of Parliament proposed the merger of BOAC and BEA, finalised in 1974, forming today&apos;s British Airways. [ World Airline Directory Flight International 28 September 1967 http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%201932.html?search%3D%22British%20Overseas%22 530 ] [ The war years ] On 24 November 1939, BOAC was created by Act of Parliament to become the British state airline, formed from the merger of Imperial Airways and British Airways Ltd. The companies had been operating together since war was declared on 1 September 1939, when their operations were evacuated from the London area to Bristol. On 1 April 1940, BOAC started operations as a single company. Following the fall of France (22 June 1940), BOAC aircraft kept wartime Britain connected with its colonies and the free world, often under enemy fire, and initially with desperate shortages of long-range aircraft. During the war, the airline was sometimes loosely referred to as &apos;British Airways&apos;, and aircraft and equipment were marked with combinations of that title and/or the Speedbird symbol and/or the Union Flag. BOAC inherited Imperial Airways&apos; flying boat services to British colonies in Africa and Asia, and, with the wartime loss of the route over Italy and France these were united into the expatriate &apos;Horseshoe Route&apos;, with Cairo as a hub, and Sydney and Durban as termini. Linking Britain to the Horseshoe Route taxed the resources of BOAC. Although Spain denied access, Portugal welcomed BOAC&apos;s civilian aircraft at Lisbon. However, the Mediterranean route from Lisbon or Gibraltar to Egypt via Malta risked enemy attack, so the long West Africa route had to be employed (over-water via Lisbon, Bathurst, Freetown, Lagos), then by landplane to Khartoum on the Horseshoe Route. The Empire routes had contained landplane sectors, but the Armstrong Whitworth Ensign and de Havilland Albatross ordered to replace the Handley Page HP.42 &apos;Heracles&apos; biplanes had proved disappointing, leaving the Short Empire flying boats as the backbone of the wartime fleet. (Only a handful of these had long range tanks but many were eventually upgraded with larger tankage and operated at overload weights). The Empire flying-boats were at their limit on the 1,900 mile Lisbon-Bathurst sector, and longer range PBY Catalina s, Boeing 314As and later converted Short Sunderland s were also used. BOAC&apos;s flying-boat base for Britain was shifted from Southampton to Poole, Dorset, and it had large bases at Durban, Asmara, Alexandria, and a pilots&apos; school at Soroti, Uganda. [ May 2012 ] Experimental flights had been made across the North Atlantic pre-war by Empire flying-boats with improved fuel capacity, some using in flight refuelling, but the final series of mail/courier flights was made by BOAC&apos;s &apos;Clare&apos; and &apos;Clyde&apos; to La Guardia in camouflage during the Battle of Britain. In 1941, BOAC was tasked with operating a &apos;Return Ferry Service&apos; from Prestwick to Montreal to reposition ferry pilots who had flown American bombers from Canada, and they were provided with RAF Liberators with a very basic passenger conversion. This was the first sustained North Atlantic landplane service.In late 1942, the new hard-surface airport at Lisbon permitted the use of civil registered Liberators to North and West Africa and Egypt.Arguably, BOAC&apos;s most famous wartime route was the &apos;Ball-Bearing&apos; run from Leuchars to Stockholm ( Bromma ), using, from 1943, civilian registered Mosquitoes. The significance of the ball-bearings is overplayed, but these night flights were an important diplomatic gesture of support for neutral Sweden which had two DC-3s shot down on its own service to Britain. Other types used to Sweden included Lockheed 14 s, Lodestar s, Consolidated Liberator s, and the sole Curtiss CW-20 (C-46 prototype) which BOAC had purchased; these types had more payload, and some had the range to avoid the enemy controlled Skaggerak direct route. [ May 2012 ] [ Early post-war operations ] BOAC Avro York freighter operating a scheduled service at Heathrow in 1953 BOAC Short Solent 3 G-AHIN &apos;&apos;Southampton&apos;&apos; served the airline&apos;s route from the UK along the Nile to Johannesburg between 1948 and 1950 BOAC DC-4M-4 Argonaut G-ALHS &quot; Astra &quot; at London Airport (Heathrow) in September 1954 { BOAC as a Lockheed 049E. At } { London Heathrow in 1954 } BOAC Boeing Stratocruiser G-AKGJ &quot; RMA Cambria &quot; at Manchester in June 1954 en route to New York At the end of the war, BOAC&apos;s fleet consisted of Lockheed Lodestars, lend-lease Douglas DC-3 s, Liberators, converted Sunderlands, and the first Avro Lancastrian s, Avro York s, and Handley Page Haltons. The Short Empire, Short S.26 and Boeing 314A flying boats, plus the AW Ensigns, were due to be withdrawn. The Corporation&apos;s aircraft, bases and personnel were scattered around the world, and it took a decade to reorganize it into an efficient unit at Heathrow. In 1943, the Brabazon Committee had laid down a set of civil aircraft transport types for the British aircraft industry to produce, but these were to be several years in coming, and particularly in the case of the tailwheel Avro Tudor, not what BOAC wanted. Since 1941, the advanced pressurised Lockheed Constellation had been under development, and in 1946 BOAC was permitted to use dollars to purchase an initial fleet of five for the prestigious North Atlantic route (there were no equivalent British types available). Throughout the whole of BOAC&apos;s existence, the argument over buying American or (often delayed) British products continued, and Parliament, the press, British manufacturers and the unions accused BOAC management of only wanting American aircraft. Whilst the major world airlines abandoned flying-boats at the end of WWII, BOAC continued with theirs until 1950, and even introduced the new Short Solent on the leisurely Nile route to south Africa. In 1948, the unpressurised Yorks were still operating passenger services as far afield as Nairobi (Kenya), Accra (Gold Coast, later Ghana), Delhi and Calcutta (India), and the type continued to operate freight schedules until late 1957. { Jackson, 1990, p. 379. } After its first six Lockheed 049 Constellations, BOAC had to use some ingenuity to increase its Constellation fleet. In 1947, Aer Linte in Eire bought five new Lockheed 749 Constellations, and prepared to launch a transatlantic service with assistance and crew-training from Captains O.P.Jones and J.C. Kelly-Rogers of BOAC. The project was abandoned in February 1948, and BOAC were able to buy the almost new 749s without dollar expenditure four months later. This enabled BOAC to serve Australia with Constellations from 1949. A total of 25 Constellations passed through the BOAC fleet, including 12 749As obtained from Capital Airlines in the mid-1950s, with BOAC&apos;s older 049s in part exchange. BOAC was also permitted to spend dollars on six new Boeing Stratocruiser s for its key transatlantic routes from October 1949, offering a double-deck non-stop eastbound service from New York City to London Airport (later Heathrow). Another four were taken over from a frustrated SAS order and seven were bought secondhand in the mid-1950s. The Handley Page Hermes and Canadair DC-4M &apos;&apos;Argonaut&apos;&apos; joined the BOAC fleet between 1949 and 1950, replacing the last of the non-pressurised types on passenger services. When service entry of the Bristol Britannia was delayed in late 1956, BOAC was permitted to purchase ten new Douglas DC-7C s. That enabled BOAC to operate non-stop westbound flights from London and Manchester to New York and other US East Coast destinations, [ Scholefield 1998 86 ] in competition with DC-7Cs of Pan American World Airways and Lockheed Super Constellations of Trans World Airlines (TWA). This was the first purchase from the Douglas Aircraft Company in BOAC&apos;s history. [ May 2012 ] [ Introduction of jets ] In May 1952, BOAC became the first airline to introduce a passenger jet, the de Havilland Comet. All Comet 1 aircraft were grounded in April 1954 after four Comets crashed, the last two being BOAC aircraft at altitude. Examination of the wreckage recovered from the Mediterranean sea-bed and observation of a sample fuselage in a pressurization test-tank at Farnborough revealed that the pressurization/depressurization cycles of airline operation could cause fatigue cracks in the thin aluminium alloy skin of the Comet leading to the skins ripping away explosively at altitude and catastophic disintegration of the aircraft.Later jet airliners including the revised Comet 4 were designed in a fail-safe mode so that in the event of for example a skin-failure due to cracking the damage would be localized and not catastrophic. In 1958, BOAC operated the first transatlantic Jet service with the new larger and longer-range Comet 4. In the 1950s, turbine powered airliners were developing rapidly, and the Comet and the seriously delayed Bristol Britannia were rendered obsolescent by the flight of the swept-wing Boeing 367-80 (707 prototype) in 1954. [ May 2012 ] In 1953, Vickers had started building the swept wing VC-7/V-1000 with Conway engines, but BOAC short-sightedly claimed that the Britannia and Comet 4 would be adequate for its purposes, and in 1955 when the military version of the V-1000 was cancelled, the 75% complete prototype was scrapped. In October 1956, BOAC ordered 15 Boeing 707 s, with Rolls-Royce Conway engines that were briefly the most economical commercial engine option, which entered service in 1960. (The British Airwothiness Authorities insisted on tail-fin modifications which Boeing applied to all 707s). Sir Giles Guthrie { BOAC&apos;s New Chairman }, who took charge of BOAC in 1964, preferred Boeing aircraft for economic reasons, and indeed BOAC began turning a profit in the late 1960s. After a political row in Parliament, the government instructed BOAC to purchase 17 Vickers VC-10 aircraft from a 30-aircraft order which Guthrie had cancelled. [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C836920%2C00.html Brickbats at BOAC Time 24 March 1967 ] The VC-10 had higher operating costs than the 707, largely as a result of BOAC&apos;s own demands for the aircraft to have excellent hot and high performance for Commonwealth (African/Asian)routes, but the larger Super VC-10 was a big success with American passengers on the North Atlantic and was profitable. The next major order of Boeing aircraft was for 11 747-100s. On 22 April 1970, BOAC received its first 747, but the aircraft did not enter commercial service for almost a year, on 14 April 1971, due to BOAC&apos;s inability to settle crewing and pay rates for the 747 with the British Air Line Pilots&apos; Association. BOAC&apos;s successor British Airways later became the largest Boeing customer outside North America. [ May 2012 ] In 1962, BOAC and Cunard formed BOAC-Cunard Ltd to operate scheduled services to North America, the Caribbean and South America. BOAC provided 70% of the new company&apos;s capital and eight Boeing 707s. The independent Cunard Eagle Airways, of which Cunard held a 60% shareholding, provided two more 707s. BOAC-Cunard lease d any spare capacity to BOAC which could use it to supplement the main BOAC fleet at peak demand, and in a reciprocal arrangement BOAC would provide capacity to BOAC-Cunard on some operations when it had a shortfall. The effect was to remove competition on western routes. { &quot; Towards a British Aeroflot &quot; Flight International 12 March 1970. } The operation was dissolved in 1966. [ Merger with BEA to form &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; British Airways &quot; &gt; British Airways &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; /link &gt;, 1974 ] On 1 September 1972, the British Airways Board was formed, a holding board that controlled BOAC and BEA. On 31 March 1974, both the BOAC and BEA were dissolved, and their operations merged to form British Airways. BOAC would have become one of the first operators of the Concorde, had it not merged to become British Airways. BA&apos;s Concordes carried registrations of G-BOAA to G-BOAG. The first Concorde delivered to British Airways was registered G-BOAC.

The aircraft was one of six that escaped after a Luftwaffe raid on Merville Airfield, France. The intended destination was Croydon. Approaching the English coast, first she lost her port inner engine and the pilot set course for RAF Hawkinge. A short time later her starboard inner engine also had to be shut down. The pilot changed course for Lympne. On landing, the starboard undercarriage was not fully down, causing the wing to scrape the ground and the aircraft to go through a fence as no braking was attempted. Euryalus was flown to RAF Hamble in June, but it was decided to cannibalise her to repair G-ADSU Euterpe which had been damaged in an accident at Bonnington on 15 December 1939. Euryalus was officially written off on 15 November 1941 and scrapped in September 1942. ( p203, p204, p205, p206 ). On 15 February 1943, a Consolidated Liberator C I, (G-AGDR), was shot down by a Royal Air Force Supermarine Spitfire in error over the English Channel near Plymouth, England. All five crew and four passengers (including Townsend Griffiss ) were killed. On 1 June 1943, a Douglas DC-3 (G-AGBB) on Flight 777 was shot down over the Bay of Biscay by German Junkers Ju 88 s. All seventeen crew and passengers were killed, including actor Leslie Howard. There has been widespread speculation that the downing was an attempt to kill British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. On 28 July 1943, a Short Sunderland (G-AGES), crashed into a hill in Dingle Peninsula near the village of Brandon in Ireland on a flight from Lisbon to Foynes. The crash killed 10 passengers and crew out of 25 on board. On 17 December 1943, a Lockheed Lodestar (G-AGDE), crashed into the sea off Leuchars, Scotland on a flight from RAF Leuchars to Stockholm-Bromma Airport. The accident killed all 10 passengers and crew on board the flight. On 11 January 1947, Douglas C-47A (G-AGJX) crashed at Stowting, Kent whilst on an international scheduled flight from Heathrow to West Africa via Bordeaux. A number of attempts were made to divert in poor weather. The aircraft crashed whilst attempting to land at Lympne. Eight people were killed and eight injured of the five crew and 11 passengers. On 2 May 1953, a de Havilland Comet I (G-ALYV) crashed near Calcutta, India after a structural failure of the airframe, when the flight took off from Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport on a flight to Delhi. The crash killed all 43 passengers and crew on board the Comet aircraft. On 10 January 1954, Flight 781, a de Havilland Comet I (G-ALYP) ( &quot; Yoke-Peter &quot; ), took off from Ciampino Airport in Rome, Italy en route to Heathrow Airport in London, England when it suffered an explosive decompression at altitude and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, killing everyone on board. On 13 March 1954, a Lockheed Constellation (G-ALAM), crashed landed at Kallang Airport after a flight from Jakarta. Killing 33 people out of 40 passengers and crew on board. On 8 April 1954, de Havilland Comet I (G-ALYY) ( &quot; Yoke-Yoke &quot; ), was operating as South African Airways Flight 201 when it crashed into the Mediterranean near Naples, Italy. Early on Christmas Day 25 December 1954, at 0330 hours, a BOAC Boeing 377 Stratocruiser crashed on landing at Prestwick, killing 28 of the 36 passengers and crew onboard. The aircraft had been en route from London to New York City, when, on approach to Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before levelling-out too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway. A number of factors have been attributed to the cause of the crash, including pilot fatigue (the captain was well over his duty limit due to the aircraft being delayed), the landing lights at Prestwick being out of action due to repair and the First Officer either not hearing a command from the Captain for landing lights (which may have helped judge the low cloud base) or mistakenly hitting the flaps, causing the aircraft to stall. On 21 September 1955, a Canadair Argonaut (G-ALHL) crashed on its fourth attempt to land at Tripoli International Airport after a flight from London and Rome. The accident killed 15 passengers and crew out of 47 people on board. On 24 June 1956, Canadair Argonaut (G-ALHE) crashed after taking off from Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport on a flight to Tripoli International Airport. The crash killed 32 passengers and crew out of 45 people on board. On 24 December 1958, a Bristol Britannia 312 (G-AOVD) crashed during a test flight near Winkton, England on the morning of 24 December 1958. On 5 March 1966, Flight 911 operated by a Boeing 707 (G-APFE), crashed on Mount Fuji after experiencing clear air turbulence. All 124 on board died. On 9 April 1968, Flight 712 crashed after a Rolls-Royce Conway engine exploded and broke-off the wing of a Boeing 707 (G-ARWE) following take-off from London Heathrow Airport and attempting an emergency landing at Heathrow and caught fire. A stewardess and four passengers were killed and 38 other passengers were injured. The stewardess, Barbara Jane Harrison, was awarded a posthumous George Cross for her part in helping passengers escape. On 9 September 1970, Flight 775 became the first British plane to be hijacked as part of the Dawson&apos;s Field hijackings. On 23 July 1971, BOAC Flight 045, from London to Khartoum, was forced by military jets to landing at Benghazi at 3.30  am. New Sudanese President Babiker El Nur, instated a week previously in a political coup, was instructed to leave the aircraft, otherwise the fighter planes would bomb it. President Babiker El Nur quickly agreed to leave in order to save the lives of the other passengers. He was quickly taken off the aircraft along with his companion, Major Farouk Osman Hamadullah, to be held at gunpoint. Despite the best efforts to save the President and his staff-member, both men were ultimately executed. On 3 August 1971, BOAC Flight 600 from Montreal to London was diverted to Denver, Colorado due to a bomb hoax inspired by a TV film Doomsday Flight. The aircraft travelled 3,200 miles out of its way to land in Denver. The supposed bomb was thought to be triggered by flying below 5,000 feet. Denver&apos;s airport was above 5,000 feet.

[ Popular culture ] Evolutions of the BOAC logo inherited from Imperial Airways, the Speedbird, continue to be used as the logo for British Airways, and continues to be used as BA&apos;s call sign. A recent commercial summarising the history of British Airways shows a BOAC VC10 aircraft. The Beatles song &quot; Back in the U.S.S.R. &quot; (released in 1968 on the White Album ) begins with the line &quot; Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC &quot;. Bobby Bloom &apos;s song &quot; Montego Bay &quot; in its first line refers to a jetliner as a &quot; BOAC &quot;, pronouncing it as an acronym rather than as an initialism, which was more usual. The acronym/title &quot; Better on a Camel &quot; was a popular nickname for BOAC [ References ] BOAC Coat of Arms Notes Bibliography [ Jackson A.J.
