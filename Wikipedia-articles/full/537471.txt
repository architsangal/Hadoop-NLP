[ December 2010 December 2010 ] [ powderblue Astor American / English United States East Coast United Kingdom Walldorf, Germany John Jacob Astor John Jacob Astor IV See early dates; &apos;The New Langwill Index&apos; William Waterhouse pub Tony Bingham ] The Astor family is an Anglo - American business family of German descent notable for their prominence in business, society, and politics. The family name appears from coast to coast in the United States. [ Founding family members ] John Jacob Astor and his brother George (b. Walldorf / Heidelberg 28 April 1752; d. London December 1813), known as &apos;George &amp; John Astor,&apos; were flute makers who came to England c. 1778 from Walldorf, Germany. In 1783, John Jacob left for Baltimore, Maryland, and was active first as a dealer in woodwind instruments, then in New York as a merchant in furs, pianos and real estate. After moving to New York, Astor met and married Sarah Todd. [ Astor, John Jacob 1900 ] Another brother, Henry Astor also emigrated to America. He was a horse racing enthusiast, and purchased a thoroughbred named Messenger who had been brought from England to America in 1788. The horse became the founding sire of all Standardbred horses in the United States today. During the 19th century, the Astors became one of the wealthiest families in the United States. Toward the end of that century, some of the family moved to Britain and achieved great prominence there. During the 20th century, the number of American Astors began to decline, but their legacy lives on in their many public works including the New York Public Library. In fact, the family remains the seventeenth wealthiest family in history. [ March 2009 ] By marrying into two British noble families [ January 2012 ], British descendants of the Astors hold two hereditary peer ages : a viscount cy and a baron y. [ Family namesake places ] For many years, the members of the Astor family were known as “the landlords of New York.” [ Astor Family ] Their New York City namesakes are the famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, an Astor Row, Astor Court, Astor Place, and Astor Avenue in the Bronx where the Astors used to stable horses. The neighborhood of Astoria, Queens, is named after the family as well. Beyond New York City, the Astor family name is imprinted in a great deal of United States history and geography. There are towns of Astor in the states of Florida, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas and there are Astorias in Illinois, Missouri and Oregon. There is an Astor Park in Wisconsin. A large number of town and city thoroughfares also bear the family name. [ December 2010 ] The Astors were also prominent on Mackinac Island, Michigan and Newport, Rhode Island with their summer house, Beechwood. At Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, there are the Lord and Lady Astor Suites; the hotel salon is called Astor&apos;s. Cliveden House Hotel in Buckinghamshire, England, once home to Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor and Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor (née Langhorne), also contains Lord and Lady Astor Suites. [ December 2010 ] A number of Astor family members are buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan, New York.
