Ashe County is located in extreme northwestern North Carolina. The county is bordered by two states: Virginia on the north; and Tennessee to the west. The county is located entirely within the Appalachian Mountains region of North Carolina. Most of the county is located atop a rolling plateau that ranges from [ 2500 ft m ] to [ 3000 ft m ] above sea level. On the county&apos;s southeastern border the land drops abruptly nearly [ 2000 ft m ] to the Foothills region of North Carolina. Numerous mountains and hills dot the plateau; among the highest is Mount Jefferson, which rises to [ 4665 ft m ], and towers more than [ 1600 ft m ] above the towns of Jefferson and West Jefferson. The county&apos;s main river is the New River, which is one of the oldest rivers in the world, and one of the few major rivers in the United States to flow north instead of south, east, or west. There are 34 recorded creeks and streams that flow into the New River in Ashe County. In 1998 the river was designated an &quot; American Heritage River &quot; by President Bill Clinton, and it is famed for its beautiful rural scenery, clear water, fly fishing, and kayaking and canoeing. Ashe County generally is known for its mountain scenery, and the tourism industry is an important mainstay of the county&apos;s economy. The Blue Ridge Parkway runs along the county&apos;s southeastern border. Ashe County has historically consisted of rural farmland, with numerous cattle and poultry farms. However, cattle farming in recent decades has given way to the industry of raising Christmas trees. Many cattle farmers have switched to growing Christmas trees, and in 1997, 2007 and 2008, an Ashe County Christmas tree was selected as the official White House Christmas Tree by the National Christmas Tree Association.

Pieces of broken pottery, arrowheads, and other Native American artifacts have been found, indicating their presence. Most of these artifacts have been found in the Old Fields area of Ashe County. The earliest Europeans to explore Ashe County were Bishop Augustus Gottlieb Spangenberg - head of the Moravian Church in America - and his associates, Timothy Horsefield, Joseph Mueller, Henry Antes, Johan Merck, and Herman Loesch. Bishop Spangenberg wrote about his journey in Ashe in a diary that has been preserved by the Moravian church. He was given [ 100,000 acre km2 ] in Virginia as a place for his fellow Moravians to settle. The only one of Spangenberg&apos;s group to return and permanently settle in Ashe County was Herman Loesch. Other early settlers were David Helton, William Walling, William McLain and Daniel Boone, the famous pioneer. With the exception of Boone, these men and their families all settled in Ashe in 1771. During the Revolutionary War one skirmish was fought in Ashe County. It is called the &quot; Battle of the Big Glades &quot;. The battle was fought in July 1780 between a force of Americans, led by Captain Robert Love, and a force of 150 British Loyalists on their way to Charlotte to join Lord Cornwallis, the British commander in the Southern colonies. The Americans won the skirmish. In the 1780s, Ashe County was considered a part of the &quot; State of Franklin &quot;. It consisted of three counties - Washington, Greene, and Sullivan. Ashe was considered to be a part of Washington County. The &quot; State of Franklin &quot; marked the beginnings of the State of Tennessee. Ashe County did not formally become a part of North Carolina until 1785. In late 1799 composed of 977 square miles, Ashe was finally pronounced an official county of the United States and of North Carolina. Many family surnames noted in the 1800 Ashe County Census, Blevins, Hart, Bare, Stamper, Miller, Burkett, Gambill, Baldwin, and Ballou as a sample, are still present today. Ashe County was named in honor of Samuel Ashe, a Revolutionary patriot, a superior court judge, and the Governor of North Carolina from 1795 to 1798. From 1807 to 1913 the county went through numerous boundary changes. In 1849, to form Watauga County, the southwestern part of Ashe County was combined with parts of Caldwell County, Wilkes County, and Yancey County. Ten years later in 1859, the eastern part of the remainder of Ashe County became Alleghany County. Ashe County has been home to, produced, or been visited by, several prominent people. Among them are Monte Weaver from Helton, a famous baseball player, who pitched for the Washington Senators and pitched a World Series game in 1933.
