The Severn has historically been a very important and busy river, and has been bridged throughout history. The bridges that stand today are often of great historical and/or engineering interest — for example the world&apos;s first iron bridge, The Iron Bridge, built from cast iron crosses the River Severn at Ironbridge Gorge. The Iron Bridge is one of three bridges on the River Severn that are listed as grade I structures, including Bewdley Bridge and the Severn Bridge, which was opened in 1966. In total, 31 bridges that cross the River Severn are listed, either grade I, II* or II. Four bridges are Scheduled Monument s, including The Iron Bridge, which are nationally important archaeological bridges. Many reaches of the Severn are prone to severe flooding, prompting the design of many unique bridges to cope with this. { TOC } [ Crossings ] [ http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ Listed Buildings 22  April 2011 English Heritage ] Key to heritage status Status Criteria scope= &quot; row &quot; |I Grade I listed.
