His older half-brother is Kim Jong-nam. His younger brother is Kim Jong-un, now the de facto leader of North Korea. In 2007, Jong-chul was appointed deputy chief of a leadership division of the Workers&apos; Party. However, on January 15, 2009, the South Korean News Agency reported that Kim Jong-il appointed his youngest son, Jong-un, to be his successor, passing over Jong-nam and Jong-chul. These reports were supported in April 2009 when Kim Jong-un assumed a low-level position within the ruling Workers&apos; Party of Korea as Kim Jong-il was groomed by his own father, Kim Il-sung, in a similar way before becoming North Korean leader in 1994.

But in May 2001, Kim Jong-nam was arrested at New Tokyo International Airport, Japan, travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He was held and then deported to the People&apos;s Republic of China. The incident caused Kim Jong-il to cancel a planned visit to China because of the embarrassment to both countries. As a result of this incident, Kim Jong-nam has fallen from favour. He was later reported to be living in Macau. In February 2003, moves began to raise the profile of Kim Jong-chul. The Korean People&apos;s Army began a propaganda campaign using the slogan &quot; The Respected Mother is the Most Faithful and Loyal Subject to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander. &quot; Since the &quot; Respected Mother &quot; was described as &quot; [devoting] herself to the personal safety of the comrade supreme commander, &quot; and &quot; [assisting] the comrade supreme commander nearest to his body &quot;, Western analysts assume that the &quot; Respected Mother &quot; was Koh Young-hee, mother of Kim Jong-chul and Kim Jong-un. { Global Security.org. &quot; Kim Jong Chol - Leadership Succession - Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea. &quot; Retrieved 2009 January 20. http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/kim-jong-chol.htm } A similar campaign was launched in praise of Kim Jong-il&apos;s mother during the later years of Kim Il-sung &apos;s life. This suggested that Kim Jong-chul, despite his youth, had emerged with Army backing to be a serious contender to succeed his father. However, Kenji Fujimoto, Kim Jong-il&apos;s personal sushi chef, wrote in his memoir, I Was Kim Jong Il&apos;s Cook, that Kim Jong Il thought Jong-chul was &quot; no good because he is like a little girl &quot;. Fujimoto believed Kim Jong-il favored his youngest son, Kim Jong-un. { &quot; Kim Jong-chul &quot;, BBC, 30 September 2010 } On June 1, 2009, it was reported that Kim Jong-chul had been passed over as his younger brother, Kim Jong-un, is to succeed his father as the head of the Korean Workers&apos; Party and de-facto head of state of North Korea.
