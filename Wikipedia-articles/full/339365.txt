During young Chappelle&apos;s formative years, his comic inspiration came from various comedians, particularly Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor. After his parents separated, Chappelle stayed in Washington with his mother while spending summers with his father in Ohio. In 1991, he graduated from Washington&apos;s Duke Ellington School of the Arts where he studied theatre arts. [ Dave Chappelle Inside the Actors Studio Inside the Actors Studio Inside the Actors Studio Bravo 2006-02-12 12 10 ] Chappelle moved to New York City to pursue a career as a comedian. He gathered the courage to perform at Harlem &apos;s famed Apollo Theater in front of the infamous &quot; Amateur Night &quot; audience. The performance resulted in him being boo ed off the stage. Chappelle has described the experience as the moment that gave him the courage to continue his show business aspirations. He quickly made a name for himself in the New York comedy circuit, even performing in the city&apos;s parks. At the age of 19, Chappelle made his film debut as &quot; Ahchoo &quot; in Mel Brooks &apos; Robin Hood: Men in Tights. In the same year, Chappelle was offered the role of Benjamin Buford &quot; Bubba &quot; Blue in Forrest Gump. Concerned about what seemed to be a racially demeaning character, he turned down the part; the film would go on to win Academy Award for Best Picture that year. He has since admitted to regretting the decision. [ Forrest Gump Trivia IMDb.com http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/trivia 2007-03-23 ] Chappelle played another supporting movie role in 1994&apos;s little-seen Getting In. He attracted the attention of TV network executives and developed numerous pilot s but none of them were picked up for series. In 1995, he made a guest appearance in an episode of ABC &apos;s highly rated sitcom Home Improvement. The storyline had Chappelle and real-life friend comedian Jim Breuer ask Tim Taylor for advice on their girlfriends. The characters&apos; single outing in the episode proved so popular that ABC decided to give them their own spin-off sitcom titled Buddies. However, after taping a pilot episode, Jim Breuer was fired and replaced with actor Christopher Gartin. Buddies premiered in March 1996 to disappointing ratings. The show was cancelled after only four episodes out of thirteen that were produced. Nine years later, in May 2005, ten of the episodes were released on a single-disc DVD to capitalize on Chappelle&apos;s new-found fame. After the failure of Buddies, Chappelle starred in another pilot. According to Chappelle, the network was uncomfortable with the African-American cast and wanted white actors added. Chappelle resisted and subsequently accused the network of racism. Shortly after this incident, Chappelle&apos;s father died. Chappelle returned to Ohio and considered leaving the entertainment business. He later appeared as a nightclub comedian in the 1996 comedy The Nutty Professor starring Eddie Murphy, one of his major comedic influences. He also had a minor role in 1997&apos;s Con Air. He and Neal Brennan co-wrote the 1998 cult stoner film Half Baked, Chappelle&apos;s first starring role, about a group of marijuana -smoking friends trying to get their friend out of jail. That same year, he appeared in &quot; Pilots and Pens Lost &quot;, a 1998 episode of The Larry Sanders Show &apos;s sixth season, in which he and the executives of the show&apos;s nameless television network satirized the treatment to which scriptwriters and show creators were subjected, as well as the executives&apos; knee-jerk tendencies toward racial stereotypes. In December of that year Chappelle appeared as Tom Hanks &apos; friend and confidant in You&apos;ve Got Mail. In 1999, he appeared in the Martin Lawrence film Blue Streak. In 2000, Chappelle recorded his first HBO special, Dave Chappelle: Killin&apos; Them Softly, in Washington, DC. { &apos;&apos;Dave Chappelle: Killin&apos; Them Softly&apos;&apos; at Amazon.com; Accessed September 29, 2010 } He followed this up with an appearance as &quot; Conspiracy Brother &quot; in the 2002 racial satire Undercover Brother.
