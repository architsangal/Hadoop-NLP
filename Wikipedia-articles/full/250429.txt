ISBN 0-89577-059-8, p. 32-33 } Chain stitch is an ancient craft - examples of surviving Chinese chain stitch embroidery worked in silk thread have been dated to the Warring States period (5th-3rd century BC). { Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance: World Textiles, Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown, 1999, ISBN 0-8212-2621-5, p. 178 } Handmade chain stitch embroidery does not require that the needle pass through more than one layer of fabric. For this reason the stitch is an effective surface embellishment near seams on finished fabric. Because chain stitches can form flowing, curved lines, they are used in many surface embroidery styles that mimic &quot; drawing &quot; in thread. { Gillow and Sentance: World Textiles, p. 178 } Chain stitches are also used in making tambour lace, needlelace, macramé and crochet.

Then, as the needle rises upward, the friction of the thread against the fabric is sufficient to form a small loop on the underside of the material. That loop is caught by a circular needle which is beneath the work. The machine then moves the material forward projecting the loop on the underside from the previous stitch. The next drop of the needle goes through the previous loop. The circular needle then releases the first loop and picks up the new loop and the process repeats. 1902 Encyclopedia The Double chain stitch uses two threads. It is rarely used in today&apos;s machines except for ornamental purposes because it uses a lot of thread. [ Machine Stitch gallery ] Formation of a simple chain stitch using a looper.
