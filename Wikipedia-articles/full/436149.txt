[ 1945 6 19 ] { San Francisco, California } { American } { American } { Rock critic for Rolling Stone, Creem, and The Village Voice } { Author, rock critic, journalist } Greil Marcus (born June 19, 1945) is an American author, music journalist and cultural critic. He is notable for producing scholarly and literary essays that place rock music in a much broader framework of culture and politics than is customary in pop music journalism. [ Life and career ] Marcus was born in San Francisco and earned an undergraduate degree in American Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, where he also did graduate work in political science. [ http://townsendcenter.berkeley.edu/una_marcus.shtml Una&apos;s Lectures – Greil Marcus townsendcenter.berkeley 2009-12-03 ] He has been a rock critic and columnist for Rolling Stone (where he was the first reviews editor, at $30 a week) and other publications, including Creem, The Village Voice, and Artforum. From 1983 to 1989, Marcus was on the Board of Directors for the National Book Critics Circle. His 1975 book, Mystery Train, was notable for placing rock and roll within the context of American cultural archetypes, from Moby-Dick to The Great Gatsby to Stagger Lee. Marcus&apos;s &quot; recognition of the unities in the American imagination that already exist &quot; [ http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0%2C%2C1797478%2C00.html observer.guardian.co.uk The 50 greatest music books ever 2006-06-18 2009-12-03 ] inspired countless rock scribes. On 30 August 2011, TIME magazine published a list of what they consider the 100 best non-fiction books since 1923, when the magazine was first published and included &quot; Mystery Train &quot; on the list, one of only five dealing with culture, and the only one dealing on the subject of American music. His next book, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century (1989), stretched his trademark riffing across a century of Western civilization. Positing punk rock as a transhistorical cultural phenomenon, Marcus examined philosophical connections between entities as diverse as medieval heretics, Dada, the Situationists, and the Sex Pistols. In 1991, Marcus published Dead Elvis, a collection of writings about Elvis Presley, and in 1993 published Ranters and Crowd Pleasers (reissued as In the Fascist Bathroom: Punk in Pop Music), an examination of post- punk political pop. In 1997, using old Bob Dylan bootlegs as a starting point, Marcus dissected the American subconscious with Invisible Republic: Bob Dylan&apos;s Basement Tapes. He currently writes the &quot; Elephant Dancing &quot; column for Interview, &quot; Real Life Rock Top Ten &quot; [ Contributors: Greil Marcus http://www.believermag.com/contributors/?read%3Dmarcus%2C%2Bgreil The Believer 27 March 2009 ] for The Believer, and occasionally teaches graduate courses in American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.
