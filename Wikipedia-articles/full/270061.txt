Situated along the perimeter of the adrenal gland, the adrenal cortex mediates the stress response through the production of mineralocorticoid s and glucocorticoid s, including aldosterone and cortisol respectively. It is also a secondary site of androgen synthesis. [ Layers ] Layer Name Primary product Most superficial cortical layer zona glomerulosa mineralocorticoid s (e.g., aldosterone ) Middle cortical layer zona fasciculata glucocorticoid s (e.g., cortisol ) Deepest cortical layer zona reticularis weak androgen s (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone, adrenosterone ) Notably, the reticularis in all animals is not always easily distinguishable and dedicated to androgen synthesis. In rodents, for instance, the reticularis also generates corticosteroids (specifically corticosterone, not cortisol). The two layers are collectively referred to as the fasciculo-reticularis.Female rodents also exhibit another cortical layer called the &quot; X zone &quot; whose function is not yet clear. [ Hormone synthesis ] All adrenocortical hormones are synthesized from cholesterol. Cholesterol is transported into the adrenal gland. The steps up to this point occur in many steroid -producing tissues. Subsequent steps to generate aldosterone and cortisol, however, primarily occur in the adrenal cortex: Progesterone → (hydroxylation at C21) → 11- Deoxycorticosterone → (two further hydroxylations at C11 and C18) → Aldosterone Progesterone → (hydroxylation at C17) → 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone → (hydroxylation at C21) → 11-Deoxycortisol → (hydroxylation at C11) → Cortisol [ Production ] The adrenal cortex produces a number of different corticosteroid hormone s. [ Mineralocorticoids ] [ Mineralocorticoids ] They are produced in the zona glomerulosa. The primary mineralocorticoid is aldosterone. Its secretion is regulated by the oligopeptide angiotensin II (angiotensin II is regulated by angiotensin I, which in turn is regulated by renin ). Aldosterone is secreted in response to high extracellular potassium levels, low extracellular sodium levels, and low fluid levels and blood volume. Aldosterone affects metabolism in different ways: It increases urinary excretion of potassium ions It increases interstitial levels of sodium ions It increases water retention and blood volume [ Glucocorticoids ] [ Glucocorticoids ] They are produced in the zona fasciculata. The primary glucocorticoid released by the adrenal gland in the human is cortisol and corticosterone in many other animals. Its secretion is regulated by the hormone ACTH from the anterior pituitary. Upon binding to its target, cortisol enhances metabolism in several ways: It stimulates the release of amino acid s from the body It stimulates lipolysis, the breakdown of fat It stimulates gluconeogenesis, the production of glucose from newly-released amino acids and lipid s It increases blood glucose levels in response to stress, by inhibiting glucose uptake into muscle and fat cells It strengthens cardiac muscle contractions It increases water retention It has anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects [ Androgens ] [ Androgens ] They are produced in the zona reticularis. The most important androgens include: [ Rainey WE, Nakamura Y Regulation of the adrenal androgen biosynthesis J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 108 3-5 281–6 2008 February 17945481 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2007.09.015 2699571 ] Testosterone : a hormone with a wide variety of effects, ranging from enhancing muscle mass and stimulation of cell growth to the development of the secondary sex characteristic s. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT): a metabolite of testosterone, and a more potent androgen than testosterone in that it binds more strongly to androgen receptors. Androstenedione (Andro): an androgenic steroid produced by the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenedione s are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgen s, they are also the parent structure of estrone. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): It is the primary precursor of natural estrogen s. DHEA is also called dehydroisoandrosterone or dehydroandrosterone. The reticularis also produces DHEA-sulfate due to the actions of a sulfotransferase, SULT2A1.
