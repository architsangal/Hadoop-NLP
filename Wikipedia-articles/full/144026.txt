Aguinaldo became the Philippines &apos; first President. He was also the youngest (at age 29) to have become the country&apos;s president, the longest-lived president (having survived to age 94) and the president to have outlived the most number of successors. [ Early life ] Emilio, nicknamed Miong was born on March 22, 1869 at Cavite El Viejo (now Kawit). The seventh of the eight children of Kapitan Carlos Aguinaldo y Jamir and Kapitana Trinidad Famy y Valero. [ Family &amp; amp; Education ] He was the seventh of eight children. His parents were of Chinese and Tagalog descent. His father, Carlos, died when Aguinaldo was just nine years old. After graduating from the University of Santo Thomas and at the San Juan de Letran College in Manila, Aguinaldo returned home to Kawit, where he developed a growing awareness of Filipino frustration with Spanish colonial rule. At the age of 17, Emilio was elected cabeza de barangay of Binakayan, the most progressive barrio of Cavite El Viejo. He held this position, representing the local residents, for eight years. He also engaged in inter-island shipping, traveling as far south as the Sulu Archipelago. Once on a trading voyage to the nearby southern islands, while riding in a big paraw (sailboat with outriggers), he grappled with, subdued, and landed a large man-eating shark, thinking it was just a large fish. In 1893, the Maura Law was passed to reorganize town governments with the aim of making them more effective and autonomous, changing the designation of town head from gobernadorcillo to capitan municipal, effective 1895. On January 1, 1895, Aguinaldo was elected town head, becoming the first person to hold the title of capitan municipal of Cavite El Viejo. [ First Marriage ] On January 1, 1896 he was married to Hilaria Del Rosario (1877–1921) the couple had five children namely Carmen Aguinaldo-Melencio, Emilio Aguinaldo, Jr, Maria Aguinaldo-Poblete, Cristina Aguinaldo-Suntay, and Miguel Aguinaldo. She died of leprosy on March 6, 1921 at the age of 44. [ Second Marriage ] Nine years after her death, Aguinaldo married to Maria Agoncillo niece of Felipe Agoncillo and Marcela Marino on July 14, 1930 at Barasoain Church. [ Descendants ] Several of Aguinaldo&apos;s descendants became prominent political figures in their own right: Cesar Virata, a grandnephew and served as Prime Minister of the Philippines from 1981 to 1986. Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera, a granddaughter served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1979 to 1992. Miguel Aguinaldo, eldest son and Councilor of Imus, Cavite. Consuelo Aguinaldo, Gen.

[ Philippine Revolution ] [ Philippine Revolution ] The flag of the K.K.K. In 1894, Aguinaldo joined the Katipunan or the K.K.K., a secret organization led by Andrés Bonifacio, dedicated to the expulsion of the Spanish and independence of the Philippines through armed force. [ Kalaw 1927 77 ] {. } Aguinaldo used the nom de guerre Magdalo, in honor of Mary Magdalene. [ Agoncillo 1990 179 ] {. } His local chapter of the Katipunan, headed by his cousin Baldomero Aguinaldo, was also called Magdalo. [ Guererro Milagros Schumacher, S.J. John Reform and Revolution Asia Publishing Company Limited 5 Kasaysayan: The History of the Filipino People 1998 962-258-228-1 ] The Katipunan revolt against the Spanish began in the last week of August 1896, in San Juan del Monte (now part of Metro Manila ). [ Agoncillo 1990 176 ] {. } However, Aguinaldo and other Cavite rebels initially refused to join in the offensive due to lack of arms. Their absence contributed to Bonifacio&apos;s defeat. While Bonifacio and other rebels were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare, Aguinaldo and the Cavite rebels won major victories in set-piece battles, temporarily driving the Spanish out of their area. On February 17, 1897, Aguinaldo and group of katipuneros defeated Spanish forces led by General Camilo de Polavieja at the Battle of Zapote Bridge in Cavite. General Edilberto Evangelista, civil engineer, revolutionary and trench builder, was killed in the battle. The province of Cavite gradually emerged as the Revolution&apos;s hotbed and the Aguinaldo-led katipuneros had a string of victories there. However, conflict between the Magdalo and another Cavite Katipunan faction, the Magdiwang, led to Bonifacio&apos;s intervention in the province. [ Agoncillo 1990 178–182 ] {. } The Cavite rebels then made overtures about establishing a revolutionary government in place of the Katipunan. [ Agoncillo 1990 182 ] {. } Though Bonifacio already considered the Katipunan to be a government, he acquiesced and presided over elections held during the Tejeros Convention in Tejeros, Cavite on March 22, 1897. Bonifacio lost the leadership to Aguinaldo, and was elected instead to the office of Secretary of the Interior. [ Agoncillo 1990 184 ] {. } Even this was questioned by Daniel Tirona, claiming Bonifacio had not the necessary schooling for the job. Insulted, Bonifacio (drew out his gun and would have killed Tirona on the spot had he not been stopped) declared the Convention null and void, and sought to return to his power base in Morong (present-day Rizal). [ Agoncillo 1990 184–185 ] {. } Bonifacio refused to recognize the revolutionary government headed by Aguinaldo and attempted to reassert his authority, accusing the Aguinaldo faction of treason and by issuing orders contravening orders issued by the Aguinaldo faction. [ Agoncillo 1990 188 ] {. } At Aguinaldo&apos;s orders, Bonifacio and his brothers were arrested and, in a mock trial lasting one day, convicted of treason, and sentenced to death. [ Agoncillo 1990 189–190 ] {. } After some vacillation, Aguinaldo commuted the death sentence, but canceled his commutation order after being convinced by Generial Manuel Noriel, President of the Council of War the death sentence, and others prominent in his government that the sentence must stand. Andrés and Procopio were executed by firing squad on May 10, 1897 at Mount Hulog, about four kilometers west of Maragondon, Cavite.

On December 23, Aguinaldo and other Katipunan officials departed for Hong Kong to enter voluntary exile. $400,000, representing the first installment of the indemnity, was deposited into Hong Kong banks. While in exile, Aguinaldo reorganized his revolutionary government into the &quot; Supreme Council of the Nation &quot;.

The consequence of this disregard of the pact by both sides was the resurgence of the revolution. [ Zaide 1999 185–186 ] {. } In April 1898, war broke out between Spain and the United States.

The Spanish fiscal system was provisionally retained. The same was done with the existing taxes, save those upon cockfighting and other amusements. War taxes were levied and voluntary contributions were solicited. Customs duties were established. A national loan was launched. [ Education Initiative ] President Jovel ordered schools open. Elementary education was made compulsory and free. The Filipino educator, Enrique Mendiola, founded the &quot; Instituto de Burgos &quot; and were appointed by the Director of Public Instruction. It offered courses in agriculture, surveying, and commerce, as well as a complete A.B course. On October 1898, a government decree fixed the opening date of the &quot; Universidad Literia &quot;. [ Guevara 1972 61 ] {. } Couses offered were Medicine, Surgery, Pharmacy, and Notary Public. The President of the Philippines appointed the professors thereof. They, in turn, chose the University rector. The first to occupy this position was Joaquín Gonzales. Later, he was succeeded by Marecil Mercado. { Antonio Molino: The Philippines through the Centuries (Volume two), 1961 } [ Local government reorganization ] Acceding to Apolinario Mabini &apos;s advice, President Aguinaldo first issued two decreed, dated 18 and 20 June, reorganizing the provincial and municipal governments. In these documents, Aguinaldo made it clear that although was circumstances had forced him to become a dictator, { Molina, Antonio. The Philippines: Through the centuries. Manila: University of Sto. Tomas Cooperative, 1961. Print. } his constant desire was to surround himself with the most representative men of every province and who, by their conduct, should merit the confidence in their province-mates, in order that, knowing, through them, the needs of every one of these places, he might adopt the best measures to attend ti them. By virtue of these decrees, the municipal government was to established along these lines: all 21-year-old residents were entitled to elect a Popular Council composed of a President, Vice-President, barrio chiefs, delegate of justice and civil registry, delegate of police and internal order, and delegate of taxes and properties. These offices were to be confirmed in their positions by the National Government. In regard to the provincial governments, the officers to be elected by the Presidents and confirmed in the same manner as the municipal counterparts, were: a Governor and three councilors, to compose, together with the municipal resident of the provincial capital, the Provincial Council. Also, provincial military commanders were provided for each to take charge of recruiting soldiers for the national army. [ Constitutional Amendments ] Realizing the unpopularity, as well as the inconvenience, occasioned by Article Five of the Malolos Constitution providing the separation of Church and State, Prime Minister Apolinario Mabini, statesmanlike, proposed an amendment, temporary in character, providing for the suspension of said article until a regular constitutional assembly shall have been convened. In the mean time the municipalities that might need the spiritual ministry of a Filipino priest, were to provide funds for his necessary support. The proposal was accented on 23 December and became Transitory Article No. 100 of the national constitution. [ Visayan Federation ] Emphasizing the solid unity of the new Republic, Raymundo Melliza was appointed as President of the Visayan Federation for two years, after having sworn allegiance to the Philippine Republic and recognizing Aguinaldo as the nation&apos;s President. [ Foreign Policies ] [ Spanish Prisoners ] Upon the inauguration of the First Philippine Republic, President Emilio Aguinaldo granted executive clemency to all Spanish civilians being held prisoners. He also granted permission for all foreigners, including Spaniards, to freely engage in business in the Philippines. [ Philippine American War ] [ Philippine-American War ] Aguinaldo boarding USS &apos;&apos;Vicksburg&apos;&apos; following his capture in 1901. On the night of February 4, 1899, a Filipino was shot by an American sentry. This incident is considered the beginning of the Philippine-American War, and open fighting soon broke out between American troops and pro-independence Filipinos. Superior American firepower drove Filipino troops away from the city, and the Malolos government had to move from one place to another. [ Zaide 1999 268, 269–270, 273–274 ] {. } Aguinaldo led resistance to the Americans, then retreated to northern Luzon with the Americans on his trail. Members of the Cabinet, whom Luna arrested for negotiating with the Americans, warned Aguinaldo that Luna had plans to start a coup against the Republic on June 13. [ http://philippineamericanwar.webs.com/lunaassassination.htm June 5, 1899: Assassination of Gen. Antonio Luna 2012-05-21 ] They also referred to Mabini having approved of the coup. On June 2, 1899, a telegram from Aguinaldo was received by Gen. Antonio Luna, a disciplinarian and brilliant general and looming rival in the military hierarchy, asking him to proceed to Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija for a meeting at the Cabanatuan Church Convent. However, treachery was afoot. Three days later (June 5), when Luna arrived, he learned Aguinaldo was not at the appointed place. As Luna was about to depart, he was shot, then stabbed to death by Aguinaldo&apos;s men. Luna was later buried in the churchyard; no investigation was made, and Luna&apos;s assassins were never punished. [ Agoncillo 1990 221–222 ] {. } After Luna&apos;s assassination, Aguinaldo assumed command of the Filipino forces. Without Luna&apos;s military expertise, Filipino forces encountered disaster everywhere. In November 1899, Aguinaldo and his staff fled northwards from the advancing Americans, to Palanan, Isabela, where he established a new headquarters. A picked force of 60 men under General Gregorio del Pilar fought a heroic battle at Tirad Pass against a much larger American force to delay the American advance to ensure Emilio Aguinaldo&apos;s escape. Del Pilar was killed in the battle along with 52 others of the defending force. [ Zaide 1999 274 ] {. } Less than two years later, on March 23, 1901, Aguinaldo was captured at his headquarters in Palanan by U.S. General Frederick Funston, with the help of Macabebe trackers. The American task force gained access to Aguinaldo&apos;s camp by pretending to be captured prisoners. Aguinaldo never received the weapons he ordered scheduled for delivery on July 2, 1901 at Digoyo in Palanan also. Aguinaldo was confined at Malacanang Palace in what is today&apos;s State Dining Room. On April 19, 1901, Aguinaldo took an oath of allegiance to the United States, formally ending the First Republic and recognizing the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines. [ Zaide 1999 274–275 ] {. } After Aguinaldo&apos;s surrender, some Filipino commanders continued the revolution. On July 30, 1901, General Miguel Malvar issued a manifesto saying, &quot; Forward, without ever turning back.... All wars of independence have been obliged to suffer terrible tests! [ Zaide 1999 275 ] {. } &quot; General Malvar surrendered to U.S forces in Lipa, Batangas on April 16, 1902.

In 1935, when the Commonwealth of the Philippines was established in preparation for Philippine independence, he ran for president in the Philippine presidential election, 1935, but lost by a landslide to fiery Spanish mestizo Manuel L. Quezon. The two men formally reconciled in 1941, when President Quezon moved Flag Day to June 12, to commemorate the proclamation of Philippine independence. During the Japanese occupation, he cooperated with the Japanese, making speeches, issuing articles and infamous radio addresses in support of the Japanese—including a radio appeal to Gen.
