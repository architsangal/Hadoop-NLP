Siegbert Tarrasch rejected the opening as unsound in his 1931 work The Game of Chess, arguing that White should reply with the Staunton Gambit, with White being better after 2.e4 fxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 c6 5. f3! exf3. [ The Game of Chess Tarrasch Siegbert Siegbert Tarrasch 1987 1934 Courier Dover Publications 978-0-486-25447-0 348 ] [ Theory ] Black&apos;s 1... f5 stakes a serious claim to the e4 square and looks towards an attack on White&apos;s kingside in the middlegame. However, it weakens Black&apos;s own kingside somewhat, and does nothing to contribute to Black&apos;s development. The Dutch is rare in top-level play. It has never been one of the main lines against 1.d4, though in the past a number of top players, including Alexander Alekhine, Bent Larsen, Paul Morphy and Miguel Najdorf, have used it with success. Perhaps its high-water mark occurred in 1951, when both world champion Mikhail Botvinnik and his challenger, David Bronstein, played it in their World Championship match in 1951. Among modern elite chess circles, its only consistent practitioner is world top-ten player Hikaru Nakamura. White most often fianchetto es his king&apos;s bishop with g3 and Bg2. Black also sometimes fianchettoes his king&apos;s bishop with...g6 and...Bg7 (the Leningrad Dutch), but may instead develop his bishop to Be7, d6 (after...d5), or b4 (the latter is most often seen if White plays c4 before castling). Play often runs 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 e6 4.Nf3 (4.Nh3!? is also possible, intending Nf4-d3 to control the e5 square if Black plays the Stonewall Variation) Be7 5.0-0 0-0 6.c4 and now Black chooses between 6...d5 (the characteristic move of the Stonewall), 6...d6, the Ilyin-Zhenevsky System (less popular today), or Alekhine&apos;s move 6...Ne4!? retaining the option of moving the d-pawn either one or two squares. The Stonewall Dutch enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the 1980s and 1990s, when leading grandmasters Artur Yusupov, Sergey Dolmatov, Nigel Short and Simen Agdestein helped develop the system where Black plays an earlier...d5 and places his dark-squared bishop on d6. [ Johnsen, Sverre and Bern, Ivar Win with the Stonewall Dutch Gambit 2010 1-906454-07-8 6 ] Termed the Modern Stonewall, this set-up has remained more popular than the traditional early...Be7. [ White continuations ] [ 2.c4 ] The traditional line is for White to play c4 on the second move. [ 2.g3 ] White may instead play g3 immediately, prioritizing the fianchetto over the pawn move. Arguably this is inferior since it doesn&apos;t deter...d5 and after this...dxc4 occurs before cxd5. In fact this is not an especially good move for Black. Thus in practice it makes little difference which move order is used, and the c4 move can be deferred quite a bit (e.g. 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.0-0 0-0 6.c4). [ 2.Nf3 ] Again this makes little difference since the move is likely to be made anyway. [ Other 2nd moves ] White has various more aggressive alternatives to the standard moves, including 2.Nc3 Nf6 (or d5) 3.Bg5; 2.Bg5 (hoping for the naive 2...h6 3.Bh4 g5 4.Bg3 (4.e4!? is also playable) f4? 5.e3 fxg3?? 6.Qh5#); and 2.e4!?, the Staunton Gambit, named after Howard Staunton, who introduced it in his match against Horwitz.
