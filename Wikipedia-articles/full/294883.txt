[ 34 30 N 94 15 W region:US inline,title ] [ 1,784,457 acre km2 ] { (7,221 km²) } { 1907 } { U.S. Forest Service } The Ouachita National Forest is a National Forest that lies in the western portion of Arkansas and portions of eastern Oklahoma. [ History ] The Ouachita National Forest is the oldest National Forest in the southern United States. The forest encompasses [ 1784457 acre km2 0 ], including most of the scenic Ouachita Mountains. Six locations in the forest, comprising [ 65000 acre km2 0 ], have been designated as wilderness areas. Ouachita is the French spelling of the Indian word Washita which means &quot; good hunting grounds &quot;. The forest was known as Arkansas National Forest on its establishment on December  18, 1907; the name was changed to Ouachita National Forest on April  29, 1926.

The Forest History Society DUPLICATE DATA: date=May 2009 ] Ouachita National Forest Rich in history, the rugged and scenic Ouachita Mountains were first explored in 1541 by Hernando de  Soto&apos;s party of Spaniards. French explorers followed, flavoring the region with names like Fourche La Fave River. The area including the forest nearly became a [ 165000 acre km2 on ] national park during the 1920s but a last-minute pocket veto by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge ended the effort. The bill had been pushed by U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson and U.S. Representative Otis Wingo, both Democrats, and State Representative Osro Cobb, then the only Republican in the Arkansas legislature. Cobb had been invited to meet with Coolidge before the proposal was killed because of opposition from the National Park Service and the United States Department of Agriculture, { Osro Cobb, Osro Cobb of Arkansas ([[Little Rock, Arkansas: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), pp. 41–44 } presumably because of the nearby location of Hot Springs National Park. In a magazine article, Cobb describes the area that he had sought to protect for future generations, located approximately midway between Little Rock and Shreveport, Louisiana, as within relatively easy driving distance of 45 million Americans, many of whom could not afford long trips to the national parks in the western states. He compared flora and fauna in the Ouachita forest to that of the southern Alleghenies, a division of the Appalachian Mountains. { Cobb, p. 282 } Cobb continues: A visitor standing upon one of the many majestic peaks in the area of the proposed park is thrilled by a panoramic view that cannot be had [ elswwhere ] in the South Central States. With cheeks flushed by the invigorating mountain beezes, the mountain climber is rewarded by an [ inspring ] view of countless and nameless peaks, mountain groups, dense forests, and inviting valleys, all merging into the distant horizon.... there are many mountain streams, now moving slowly in narrow but deep pools, then churning with savage ferocity down some water-worn precipice, leaving in its wake snow-white sprays... Fed by crystal springs and like so much molten silver these streams flow their turbulent courses unappreciated and rarely visited.... { Cobb, p. 285 } [ Features ] The Forest contains extensive woodlands of stunted Northern Red Oak, White Oak, Post Oak, and Blackjack Oak at elevations over [ 2500 ft m ] and on steep, dry slopes. [ http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/ar.pdf Old Growth in the East: A Survey. Arkansas Mary Byrd Davis 23 January 2008 ] These woodlands, of little commercial value, were never logged and the extent of old growth forest within them may total nearly [ 800000 acre km2 ]. There are also old-growth woodlands of Eastern Redcedar, Gum Bumelia, Winged Elm, and Yaupon along some streams. Two wilderness areas are found in the forest, protecting the sections of the forest that have had the least amount of human intervention. The [ 13139 acre km2 1 on ] Black Fork Mountain Wilderness is located in both Arkansas and Oklahoma and contains significant old-growth forests. The [ 9754 acre km2 1 on ] Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness is located solely in Oklahoma. The Talimena Scenic Drive, which is Highway 1 in Oklahoma and Highway  88 in Arkansas, is a National Scenic Byway which meanders through the forest providing amazing vistas and excellent photo opportunities. The Scenic Drive passes through old-growth oak woodlands on Winding Stair and Rich Mountains. Forest headquarters are located in Hot Springs, Arkansas. [ Recreation ] The forest contains a number of hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding trails. The most extensive hiking trail is the Ouachita National Recreation Trail, which traverses [ 223 mi km ] across the region. This is a well-maintained backpacking, hiking trail with overnight shelters in several portions of the trail. Mountain biking is also allowed for some sections of the trail. In the Oklahoma section of the forest the [ 26445 acre km2 0 on ] Winding Stair Mountain National Recreation Area and six other designated areas offer visitors a full range of activities with more than 150  campsites, a [ 90 acre ha on ] lake, and an equestrian camp. Southeast of Idabel, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation manages the Red Slough Wildlife Mananagement Area, a [ 5,814 acre km2 ] wetland area donated to the USFS by The Conservation Fund in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Hunting (no lead shot) and fishing are allowed there. The area is also a destination for birdwatchers from throughout the United States and the United Kingdom as well. Canoeing and fishing are popular activities on the Mountain Fork River, Caddo River, Little Missouri River, and Ouachita River within the bounds of the forest. The Cossatot River, said to be the most difficult whitewater river between the Smoky and Rocky Mountains, also passes through the forest. Rockhound s frequent a belt several miles wide containing concentrations of quartz crystals. Visitors and rock collectors are free to pick up loose crystals within the belt for personal use and may dig for quartz with the permission of the district ranger. [ Counties ] Ouachita National Forest is located in 13 counties in western and central Arkansas and 2  counties in southeastern Oklahoma. They are listed here in descending order of forestland within the county. Also given is their area as of September  30, 2007. { http://www.fs.fed.us/land/staff/lar/2007/TABLE_6.htm } About 80% of the forest&apos;s area is in Arkansas, with the remaining 20% in Oklahoma. In Arkansas there are local ranger district offices located in Booneville, Danville, Glenwood, Jessieville, Mena, Mount Ida, Oden, Perryville, and Waldron. In Oklahoma they are located in Hodgen, Talihina, and north of Broken Bow. Even though the Ouachita National Forest is far from being the largest, its twelve ranger districts are the most of any in the National Forest system. The giant Tongass National Forest in Alaska is second with nine ranger district divisions. { USFS Ranger Districts by State } [ 369,618 acre km2 ] [ 335,846 acre km2 ] [ 221,546 acre km2 ] [ 206,400 acre km2 ] [ 188,835 acre km2 ] [ 132,936 acre km2 ] [ 120,553 acre km2 ] [ 99,171 acre km2 ] [ 58,950 acre km2 ] [ 18,956 acre km2 ] [ 18,585 acre km2 ] [ 9,535 acre km2 ] [ 1,675 acre km2 ] [ 1,531 acre km2 ] [ 320 acre km2 ] Scott County, Arkansas Montgomery County, Arkansas Le Flore County, Oklahoma Polk County, Arkansas Yell County, Arkansas McCurtain County, Oklahoma Garland County, Arkansas Perry County, Arkansas Saline County, Arkansas Sebastian County, Arkansas Logan County, Arkansas Pike County, Arkansas Ashley County, Arkansas Howard County, Arkansas Hot Spring County, Arkansas [ Points of interest ] Beavers Bend Resort Park Broken Bow Lake Kerr Arboretum and Botanical Area Winding Stair Mountain National Recreation Area Black Fork Mountain Wilderness Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness Ouachita National Recreation Trail [ References ] [ External links ] Friends of the Ouachita Trail (FoOT) Ouachita National Forest (USDA Forest Service) National Forest Category:National Forests of Arkansas Category:National Forests of Oklahoma Category:Protected areas of Scott County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Montgomery County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Le Flore County, Oklahoma Category:Protected areas of Polk County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Yell County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of McCurtain County, Oklahoma Category:Protected areas of Garland County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Perry County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Saline County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Sebastian County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Logan County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Pike County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Ashley County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Howard County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Hot Spring County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas established in 1907 fa:جنگل ملی اواچیتا fr:Forêt nationale d&apos;Ouachita
