His playing career included spells at Queens Park Rangers, Beşiktaş, Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Bolton Wanderers F.C., during which period he earned a number of appearances for England. He became the first player to score for 6 different Premier League clubs. He is the cousin of current Premier League players Rio and Anton Ferdinand and his son Aaron currently plays for Harrow Borough in the Isthmian League. He also has a daughter, Lauren. Popularly nicknamed Sir Les, he was made an MBE in the 2005 Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours. [ Kate O&apos;Hara Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours List Yorkshire Post 2005-06-11 http://www.yorkshiretoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID%3D55%26amp%3BArticleID%3D1053124 2006-10-06 ] On 5 November 2008 Ferdinand joined fellow ex-Spur Tim Sherwood on the coaching staff of Tottenham Hotspur, utilising his experience to work with the strikers.

He was spotted by Queens Park Rangers and moved there for £ 30,000. [ QPR ] Ferdinand made his QPR debut on 20 April 1987, aged 20, as a substitute in the 4-0 league defeat by Coventry City at Highfield Road - the first of two league appearances that season. He played a further league game in 1987-88, and had a three-game loan spell at Third Division Brentford. In 1988, he was loaned to Turkish side Beşiktaş for a season, and performed well with 14 goals in 24 games. He was back in the QPR side for the 1989-90 season, but managed just nine First Division appearances as well as his first two English league goals. He fared better in 1990-91, managing 18 league games and scoring eight goals as QPR secured a familiar mid table finish. His 10 goals from 23 games in 1991-92 helped ensure QPR&apos;s status as founder members of the new FA Premier League for the 1992-93 season, and it was during this campaign that he established himself as a top striker, scoring 20 goals in 37 games as QPR finished fifth - the highest placed of all the London sides. His fine form continued into 1993-94, during which his 16 goals from 36 games helped QPR finish ninth. Despite mounting speculation of a move to either Manchester United or Arsenal, he signed a two-year contract with QPR that summer. He enjoyed arguably his best season yet in 1994-95, as he was on target 24 times in the Premier League and speculation grew that he would soon be on his way to a bigger club. In nearly a decade at Loftus Road, he played under four different managers - Jim Smith, Trevor Francis, Don Howe and Gerry Francis. [ Newcastle United ] Ferdinand was sold to Newcastle in 1995 for £6 million, with Hayes receiving £600,000 due to a sell-on clause agreed following his move to QPR (with the money received Hayes built a function suite and named it &quot; The Ferdinand Suite &quot; in his honour). It was a tidy profit for a player who had cost them a mere £5,000. His arrival at the club came nearly three years after the Magpies had offered QPR £3.3million for him during their Division One promotion season - but the offer had been turned down.

He scored 29 goals in his first season with Newcastle, and significantly contributed to the side&apos;s getting within touching distance of the Premiership title in the 1995–96 season. Newcastle led the league by 12 points at one stage, but were overhauled by United in the final three months of the season. In both of his seasons on Tyneside, Ferdinand collected runners-up medals in the Premier League. In the second season, they contested a four-horse race with Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool before Manchester United won the title. Ferdinand scored 50 goals in only 84 games at Newcastle, forming a successful partnership with Alan Shearer. He was and indeed is still very highly thought of by Newcastle United and received a standing ovation when he came on as a substitute at Alan Shearer&apos;s testimonial and subsequently scored. [ Tottenham Hotspur ] In 1997 Ferdinand was bought by Tottenham Hotspur, the club he supported as a boy, again for £6 million. Injuries heavily disrupted his first season at the club, but towards the end of the campaign he formed a good partnership with Jürgen Klinsmann, and the pair&apos;s goals saved Spurs from relegation from the Premiership. Ferdinand helped Spurs win the League Cup in 1999, defeating Leicester City 1–0 in the final at Wembley, but injuries restricted him to just 12 goals in his first three seasons at the club. He scored 10 goals in the 2000–01 season and 15 in 2001–02. He played in a second League Cup final for the club, against Blackburn Rovers, but was thwarted by three saves by Rovers&apos; goalkeeper Brad Friedel as Spurs lost 2–1. Ferdinand scored the 10,000th goal in Premiership history on 15 December 2001 for Spurs against Fulham. [ Later career ] In January 2003, he moved to West Ham United, and scored his first goal for the club against former club Tottenham, [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2790031.stm Hammers see off Spurs BBC 1 March 2003 9 September 2009 ] but was unable to prevent the club&apos;s relegation from the Premier League and opted to remain in the top flight by signing for newly promoted Leicester City on a free transfer. While at Leicester Ferdinand scored 14 Premiership goals, despite being 37 years old. After the Foxes were relegated at the end of that season, he rejected a new contract and joined Bolton Wanderers. [ Ferdinand joins Bolton http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/3863503.stm BBC Sport 5 Jul 2004 19 May 2011 ] Ferdinand memorably scored for Bolton Wanderers against rivals Manchester United in the last minute, which looked to have given the Wanderers the win, but a goal from David Bellion even deeper in injury time gave United a point.

Four days later, he signed with Reading. His contract at the club lasted until the end of the 2004–05 season. He scored one league goal in his time at Reading, in a 2-1 loss to Coventry. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4259873.stm Reading 1-2 Coventry BBC 19 February 2005 27 August 2009 ] Ferdinand committed to non-contract terms with Watford during the 2005–06, but did not play a competitive game for the club and left after their promotion to the Premier League via the Football League Championship playoffs. He retired from football a few months short of his 40th birthday. [ International career ] Ferdinand made his England debut in February 1993 against San Marino, scoring the final goal in a 6–0 victory at Wembley. For England, Ferdinand was capped 17 times, scoring five goals. He was part of the Euro 96 and 1998 FIFA World Cup squads. Despite his successful season with Newcastle he did not play a game in 1996, and an injury meant he did not play a match in 1998.

Although at one point he claimed to have &quot; helped a few lads over the wall &quot;, he later claimed to have been joking.
