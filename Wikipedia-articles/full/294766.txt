[ the competitive event the airshow disaster Flugtag &apos;88 ] { Pub &apos; at the 2003 Flugtag, } { Hyde Park, } { London } { Strogino Beach, } { Moscow } Red Bull Flugtag ( German : flight day, airshow ) is an event owned and operated by Red Bull in which competitors attempt to fly homemade size (max 10m / 30  ft) and weight (max 150  kg / 330  lbs) limited human-powered flying machines. The flying machines are usually launched off a pier about [ 30 ft m ] high into the sea (or suitably sized reservoir of water). Most competitors enter for the entertainment value, and the flying machines rarely fly at all. [ Background ] Flugtag is the brainchild of Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz. { 1st RED BULL FLUGTAG SYDNEY | Mrs Macquarie&apos;s Point, adjacent to The Royal Botanic Gardens | SYDNEY | AUSTRALIA | 6 APRIL 2008 | RED BULL FLUGTAG SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA } Although the format was originally invented in Selsey, a small seaside town in the south of England under the name &quot; Birdman Rally &quot; in 1971 { First known Flugtag format event } The first Red Bull Flugtag competition was held in 1991 in Vienna, Austria.

To participate, each team must submit an application and their contraption must meet the criteria set forth by Red Bull. The criteria varies with location. In the USA each flying machine must have a maximum wingspan of 30 feet (9.14 m) and a maximum weight (including pilot) of 450  lbs. (204  kg). In Australian Flugtags the wingspan is limited to 26.25 feet (8.0 m) and the weight (NOT including pilot) to 396.8  lb (180.0  kg). { http://www.redbull.com.au/cs/userfiles/file/RedBullFlugtag_TC_updated_6.pdf } The craft must be powered by muscle, gravity, and imagination. Because the aircraft will ultimately end up in the water, it must be unsinkable and constructed entirely of environmentally friendly materials. The aircraft may not have any loose parts and advertising space is limited to [ 1 sqft m2 on ]. Teams that enter the Flugtag competition are judged in three categories; distance, creativity, and showmanship. The record for the longest flight is 229 feet (69.79 m), set May 28, 2012 at the Flugtag in Mainz, Germany by the team &quot; Die Rückkehr der Teichfighter &quot; in front of more than 60,000 people. { 69,79 Meter - &quot; Die Rückkehr der Teichfighter &quot; gleiten zum Weltrekord } The US city that holds the record for attendance to this event is Tampa, FL with 110,000 attending in 2008.
