[ New Black Panther Party 200px #FFFFFF Malik Zulu Shabazz Malik Zulu Shabazz 1989, Dallas, Texas, by Aaron Michaels Black nationalism, Pan-Africanism, Anti-capitalism, Anti-Zionism, Anti-imperialism Dallas, Texas ] The New Black Panther Party (NBPP), whose formal name is the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, is a U.S. -based black political organization founded in Dallas, Texas in 1989. Despite its name, NBPP is not an official successor to the Black Panther Party. { &quot; There is No New Black Panther Party &quot;, The Dr. Huey P. Newton Foundation. } Members of the original Black Panther Party have insisted that the newer party is illegitimate and have firmly declared that &quot; there is no new Black Panther Party &quot;. The Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights consider the New Black Panthers to be a hate group. { &quot; New Black Panther Party. &quot; } { Southern Poverty Law Center.

Retrieved August 13, 2011. } When former Nation of Islam (NOI) minister Khalid Abdul Muhammad became the national chairman of the NBPP from the late 1990s until his death in 2001, the group attracted many breakaway members of the NOI. The NBPP is currently led by Malik Zulu Shabazz; it upholds Khalid Abdul Muhammad as the de facto father of the movement. In April 2010, Malik Zulu Shabazz appointed French Black leader Stellio Capo Chichi as the representative of the movement in France. { &quot; Kemi Seba nommé par le NEW BLACK PANTHER PARTY, basé à Washington, Ministre francophone &quot;, Official website of MDI } Capo Chichi has been holding the position of head of the francophone branch of NBPP. { &quot; Interview d’Hery Djehuty Sechat, nouveau Président du MDI &quot;, Official website of MDI } [ Background ] [ April 2012 ] In 1987, Michael McGee, an alderman in Milwaukee, threatened to disrupt white events throughout the city unless more jobs were created for black people. He held a &quot; state of the inner city &quot; press conference in 1990 at City Hall to announce the creation of the Black Panther Militia. Aaron Michaels, a community activist and radio producer, was inspired to establish the New Black Panther Party. [ April 2012 ] Michaels rose to widespread attention for the first time when [ April 2012 ] he called on blacks to use shotguns and rifles in Philadelphia to protest against the chairman of a school board who had been taped calling black students &quot; little nigger s &quot;. { Gregory, Kia (2003-12-17). &quot; The Cats Came Back: Can the Black Panther Party become a force again in Philadelphia? &quot; Philadelphia Weekly, 17 December 2003. Retrieved from http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/the_cats_came_back-38373074.html. } In 1998, the attorney Khalid Abdul Muhammad brought the organization into the national spotlight when he led the group to intervene in response to the 1998 murder of James Byrd, Jr. in Jasper, Texas. He also made the NBPP well-known for their vehement school board disruptions and public appearances. [ April 2012 ] [ Philosophy, ideology, and criticism ] The New Black Panther Party identifies with the original Black Panther Party and claims to uphold its legacy. It also says that many others see the organization similarly. The NBPP is largely seen by both the general public and by prominent members of the original party as illegitimate. Huey Newton Foundation members, containing a significant number of the original party&apos;s leaders, once successfully sued the group; their ultimate objective in doing so — to prevent the NBPP from using the Panther name — appears to have been unsuccessful. In response to the suit, Aaron Michaels branded the original Panthers &quot; has-been wannabe Panthers &quot;, adding: &quot; Nobody can tell us who we can call ourselves. &quot; [ http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/274.html Black Panthers: old v. young March 16, 1997 London Sunday Times August 13, 2010 ] Although the NBPP says it sees capitalism as the fundamental problem with the world and &quot; revolution &quot; as the solution, the new party does not draw its influences from Marxism or Maoism as the original party did. Instead, it promotes the Kawaida theory of Maulana Karenga, which includes black unity, collective action, and cooperative economics. { Local Objectives at official website } The NBPP says it fights the oppression of black and brown people and that its members are on top of current issues facing black communities across the world. Also, it notes that not all its members are members of the Nation of Islam, though the group acknowledges universal &quot; spirituality &quot; practices within the organization. { 10 Point Platform at official website } Over time, many groups subscribing to varying degrees of radicalism have called for the &quot; right to self-determination &quot; for black people, particularly US blacks. Critics of the NBPP say that the group&apos;s politics represent a dangerous departure from the original intent of black nationalism; specifically, that they are starkly anti-white, and also antisemitic. The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies the NBPP as a &quot; black racist &quot; hate group. [ New Black Panther Party http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/new-black-panther-party 23 May 2012 ] Even the mildest critics of the organization have said that the NBPP&apos;s provocative brand of black supremacy undermines other civil rights efforts. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a NBPP critic, has noted Muhammad&apos;s statement that &quot; there are no good crackers, and if you find one, kill him before he changes. &quot; { Khalid Abdul Muhammad at Jewish Virtual Library } [ http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp?T%3D32%26amp%3Bm%3D5 ? ] [ July 2010 ] [ Membership size ] As of 2009, the NBPP claimed a few thousand members organized in 45 chapters, while independent estimates by the Anti-Defamation League suggest that the group is &quot; much smaller &quot; but is nevertheless able to attract a large turnout of non-members (some of whom &quot; may not even realize what this group actually stands for &quot; ) to its events by focusing on specific issues of local interest. { Inside the New Black Panthers, National Geographic ( aired 2009 ).

The NBPP&apos;s Chief of Staff, Hashim Nzinga, had been acting as security detail for McKinney when he physically attacked reporters, calling them &quot; Jews &quot; and insisting that they must focus on Hank Johnson rather than on McKinney, since Johnson, he alleged, was a &quot; Tom &quot;. [ http://www.11alive.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid%3D83191 ? ] [ July 2010 ] In a subsequent appearance on the Fox News Channel program Hannity &amp; Colmes, Nzinga defended these actions. He accused his interviewers of being part of a Zionist media complex bent on defaming African Americans and, by extension, the New Black Panthers. { Video clip, Hannity &amp; Colmes, FOX News. } In 2006, the New Black Panther Party regained the media spotlight by intervening in the 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal, organizing marches outside Duke University and making numerous media appearances to demand that the jury organized by District Attorney Nifong convict the accused lacrosse players. { Biesecker, Michael. &quot; New Black Panthers demonstrate, but not on Duke campus &quot;, } { The News &amp; Observer, 2 May 2006. } Malik Zulu Shabazz met with the DA and asserted repeatedly that the DA&apos;s answers meant he was supporting the claims made by the NBPP, a point that was widely disputed. On April 12, 2007, after District Attorney Nifong&apos;s case collapsed, and the Duke Lacrosse players were exonerated, Malik Zulu Shabazz appeared on The O&apos;Reilly Factor. He refused to apologize for his actions in the leadup to the Duke University lacrosse rape scandal, stating that he did not know whether or not anything happened to the young accuser. He stated his beliefs that the rich, white families of Duke had placed political pressure on the investigation and forced the charges to be dropped. When questioned by guest host Michelle Malkin, he labeled her a &quot; political prostitute &quot; and &quot; mouthpiece for a male, chauvinist racist Bill O&apos;Reilly. &quot; Malkin said, &quot; There&apos;s only one whore on this split screen and it&apos;s you, Mr. Shabazz. &quot; Shabazz replied, &quot; You should be ashamed of yourself for defending and being a spokesman for Bill O&apos;Reilly, who has no respect for women. &quot; [ NBPP Malik Shabazz on Fox with Michelle Malkin The O&apos;Reilly Factor http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Doo-xbIBlmRc 3:30 April 12, 2007 ] [ Racial dialogue?

The rally ended in scuffles with the New York Police Department as Muhammad urged the crowd to attack officers who had attempted to confiscate the NBPP members&apos; guns. Chairs and bottles were thrown at the police but only a few in the conflict suffered injuries. The Million Youth March was made an annual event, but popularity dropped rapidly. King Samir Shabazz, a former Nation of Islam member and head of the New Black Panther Party&apos;s Philadelphia chapter, has a long history of confrontational racist behavior. He advocated racial separation and made incendiary racial statements while promoting anti-police messages in the media and on the streets of Philadelphia. He publicly announced &quot; I hate white people. All of them. &quot; He also suggested the killing of white babies.

The suit accused members King Samir Shabazz and Jerry Jackson of being outside a polling location wearing the uniform of the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, and said &quot; that Shabazz repeatedly brandished a police-style baton weapon. { Justice Department Seeks Injunction Against New Black Panther Party: Lawsuit Seeks to Prohibit Voter Intimidation in Future Elections &quot;, US Department of Justice, 7 January 2009. } The suit sought an injunction preventing further violations of the Voting Rights Act.

[ October 2010 ] On May 29, 2009, the Department of Justice requested and received an injunction against the member who had carried the nightstick, but against the advice of prosecutors who had worked on the case, department superiors ordered the suit dropped against the remaining members.
