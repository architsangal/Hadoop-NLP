Wood has written and starred in sketches, plays, films and sitcoms, and her live comedy act is interspersed with her own compositions, which she accompanies on piano. [ Brandwood Neil Victoria Wood  – The Biography 1st Edition 2002 Boxtree London 1-85227-982-6 ] Much of her humour is grounded in everyday life, and includes references to popular British media and brand names of quintessentially British products. She is noted for her skills in observing culture, and in satirising social classes. [ Duguid Mark Wood, Victoria (1953–) British Film Institute 2003-07 http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/578938/index.html 2007-10-18 ] She started her career in 1974 by winning the ATV talent show New Faces. It wasn&apos;t until the 1980s that she began to establish herself as a comedy star, with the award-winning television series Victoria Wood As Seen On TV and became one of Britain&apos;s most popular stand-up comedians. In 1998, she wrote and starred in the (again, award-winning) sitcom dinnerladies. [ The custard.tv guide to... dinnerladies custard.tv 2004 http://www.thecustard.tv/shows/dinnerladies.html 17 September 2007 ] In 2006, she won two BAFTA awards for her one-off drama for ITV1, Housewife, 49. Wood frequently works with long-term collaborators Julie Walters, Duncan Preston and Celia Imrie. [ Career ] [ Early years ] Wood is the youngest daughter of Stanley Wood and Nellie Mape. She has three siblings: a brother, Chris, and two sisters, Penny and Rosalind. Wood was educated at Bury Grammar Girls&apos; School [ http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/broadcasters4.html Manchester Television Broadcasters and Media Celebrities including Cannon and Ball, Alistair Cooke, Mike Yarwood, Joanne Kilmer Whalley, Victoria Wood, Peter Skellern, Bernard Wrigley and John Mahoney www.manchester2002-uk.com 2010-08-22 ] and began her showbusiness career while an undergraduate studying drama at the University of Birmingham, appearing on the TV talent show New Faces. This led to her appearance in a sketch show featuring the winners of that series, The Summer Show. [ http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/488970 BFI Film &amp; TV Database on The Summer Show BFI 2007-03-29 ] Her first big break was as a novelty act on the BBC &apos;s consumer affairs programme That&apos;s Life! in 1976. Wood had first met long-term collaborator Julie Walters in the early 1970s, when Wood applied for Manchester Polytechnic, and coincidentally met up once more when they appeared together in the same theatre revue, In At The Death, in 1978 (for which Wood wrote a brief sketch). Its success led to the commissioning of Wood&apos;s first play, Talent (also 1978), starring Hazel Clyne (in a role which had been written for Walters), and which won Wood an award for &apos;Most Promising New Writer&apos;. Peter Eckersley, the then-head of drama at Granada Television, saw Talent and immediately invited Wood to create a television adaptation. This time Julie Walters took the lead role which had been written for her, while Wood reprised her stage role. [ Duguid Mark Screenonline  — Talent (1979) British Film Institute 2003-07 http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1241050/index.html 2007-10-18 ] [ 1980–88 ] The success of the television version of Talent led to Wood writing the &quot; follow-up &quot;, Nearly A Happy Ending. Shortly afterwards, a third play for Granada was written and made, Happy Since I Met You, again with Walters alongside Duncan Preston as the male lead. During 1980 she also wrote and starred in the stage play Good Fun. Recognising her talent, Eckersley offered Wood a sketch show, though Wood was unsure of the project; she only agreed to go ahead with the programme if Walters received equal billing. Eckersley came up with the obvious title Wood and Walters, { ITV 50: What Did ITV Do For Me?, interview with Victoria Wood (September 2005). } and the dry run of the show (the pilot episode) was filmed. The programme was arranged to be made into a full series, and went on to co-star Duncan Preston and a cast of other supporting actors. However, in between the filming of the pilot and the series, Eckersley died. Wood cites Eckersley as giving her first big break, and feels that Wood and Walters suffered due to his death. She was not impressed by Brian Armstrong, the emergency fill-in for Eckersley, and was of the opinion that he hired unsuitable supporting actors. Wood also appeared as a presenter in Yorkshire Television &apos;s schools television programme for hearing-impaired children, Insight, alongside Derek Griffiths, between 1980 and 1983. In 1982 and 1983 she appeared in BBC Radio&apos;s Just a Minute. Wood left Granada in 1984 for the BBC, who promised Wood more creative control over projects. Later that year, Wood&apos;s sketch show Victoria Wood As Seen On TV went into production. This time, Wood chose actors and actresses herself: her friend Julie Walters once again starred, as did Duncan Preston. Wood&apos;s friend Celia Imrie was also cast, as well as Susie Blake and Patricia Routledge. As Seen On TV was notable for featuring classic sketches such as Acorn Antiques, a spoof of low-budget soap opera and rumoured to be named after an antiques shop in her birthplace. Acorn Antiques is remembered for characters such as &quot; Mrs Overall &quot; (played by Walters), the deliberately bad camera angles and wobbling sets, as well as Celia Imrie&apos;s sarcastic tone as &quot; Miss Babs &quot;. The sketches were seen as satirising the production values of the ITV soap opera Crossroads in the 1970s. Wood&apos;s most popular comic song, &quot; The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let&apos;s Do It) &quot; originated in this show. It tells the story of Freda (a woman eager for sex) and Barry (an introverted man terrified of sex), makes clever use of allusions to a multitude of risqué activities while avoiding all taboo words. [ Wood Victoria The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let&apos;s do it!) prestel.co.uk http://www2.prestel.co.uk/cello/BarryAndFreda.htm 2007-08-27 ] There was a second series of Victoria Wood As Seen On TV in 1986, followed by a one-off &apos;special&apos; in 1987. In 1988, she appeared in the BAFTA -winning An Audience With Victoria Wood for ITV. At the time of recording the show, Wood was six months pregnant. [ 1989–99 ] During this period Wood began to move away from the sketch show format and into more self-contained works, often with a more bittersweet flavour. Victoria Wood (six parts, 1989)) featured Wood in several individual stories such as &quot; We&apos;d Quite Like To Apologise &quot;, set in an airport departure lounge, and &quot; Over to Pam &quot;, set around a fictional talk show. [ http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1241016/index.html Screenonline  — Victoria Wood (1989) Screenonline Online 2007 ] There was a brief return to sketches with the 1992 Christmas Day special Victoria Wood&apos;s All Day Breakfast. [ = All Day Breakfast (1992)(TV) IMDB 2007 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284621/ 2007-10-18 ] The television film, Pat and Margaret (1994), starring Wood and Julie Walters as long-lost sisters with very different lifestyles, continued her return to stand-alone plays with a poignant undercurrent to the comedy. [ Duguid Mark Screenonline  — Pat and Margaret (1994) British Film Institute 2003-07 http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1246899/index.html 2007-10-18 ] In 1998, she wrote her first sitcom, dinnerladies, which continued her now established milieu of mostly female, mostly middle-aged characters depicted vividly and amusingly, but with a counterpoint of sadder themes.

However, it was during this period that Wood tended to move away from comedy, focusing on drama instead. She did continue to produce one-off specials, though, including Victoria Wood&apos;s Sketch Show Story (2002) and Victoria Wood&apos;s Big Fat Documentary (2005).

It starred most of the original cast, with Sally Ann Triplett playing Miss Berta (played in the series by Wood). Wood played Julie Walters&apos; character Mrs. Overall for matinee performances.

Housewife, 49 was critically praised, and Wood won BAFTA s for both her acting and writing for this drama  — a rare double.
