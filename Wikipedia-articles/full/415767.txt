David Sylvan, Stephen Majeski, p.121. } In 1951, Iran&apos;s oil industry was nationalized with near-unanimous support of Iran&apos;s parliament in a bill introduced by Mossadegh who led the nationalist parliamentarian faction. Iran&apos;s oil had been controlled by the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). { &quot; The Company File—From Anglo-Persian Oil to BP Amoco &quot; } Popular discontent with the AIOC began in the late 1940s, a large segment of Iran&apos;s public and a number of politicians saw the company as exploitative and a vestige of British imperialism. { U.S. Foreign Policy and the Shah: Building a Client State in Iran by Mark J. Gasiorowski (Cornell University Press: 1991) p. 59. ISBN 978-0-8014-2412-0 } Despite Mosaddegh&apos;s popular support, Britain was unwilling to negotiate its single most valuable foreign asset, and instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically. { Mary Ann Heiss in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, p.178–200 } Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the Abadan oil refinery, the world&apos;s largest, but Prime Minister Clement Attlee opted instead to tighten the economic boycott { Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran } while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh&apos;s government. { Kinzer, All the Shah&apos;s Men, p.3 (In October 1952 Mosaddeq &quot; orders the British embassy shut &quot; after learning of British plotting to overthrow him.) } With a change to more conservative governments in both Britain and the United States, Churchill and the U.S. Eisenhower administration decided to overthrow Iran&apos;s government though the predecessor U.S. Truman administration had opposed a coup. { Kinzer, Stephen. All the Shah&apos;s Men. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008, p. 3 } Britain and the U.S. selected Fazlollah Zahedi to be the prime minister of a military government that was to replace Mosaddegh&apos;s government. Subsequently, a royal decree dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing Zahedi was drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. The Central Intelligence Agency had successfully pressured the weak monarch to participate in the coup, while bribing street thugs, clergy, politicians and Iranian army officers to take part in a propaganda campaign against Mosaddegh and his government. { Gasiorowski, p.237–9, 243 } At first, the coup appeared to be a failure when on the night of 15–16 August, Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri was arrested while attempting to arrest Mosaddegh. The Shah fled the country the next day. On 19 August, a pro-Shah mob, paid by the CIA, marched on Mosaddegh&apos;s residence. { Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p.xiv } According to the CIA&apos;s declassified documents and records, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-Shah riots on 19 August. Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city.

[ http://www.systemicpeace.org/warlist.htm CSP – Major Episodes of Political Violence, 1946–2008 Systemicpeace.org 22 September 2011 ] Mosaddegh was arrested, tried and convicted of treason by the Shah&apos;s military court. On 21 December 1953, he was sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life. { Abrahamian, Ervand, Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian, (Princeton University Press, 1982), p.280 } { Mossadegh – A Medical Biography by Ebrahim Norouzi } { Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics by L.P. Elwell-Sutton.&apos;&apos; 1955. Lawrence and Wishart Ltd. London } Mosaddegh&apos;s supporters were rounded up, imprisoned, tortured or executed. After the coup, Pahlavi ruled as an authoritarian monarch for the next 26 years, until he was overthrown in a popular revolt in 1979. { Kinzer, Stephen, All the Shah&apos;s Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, John Wiley and Sons, 2003. } The tangible benefits the United States reaped from overthrowing Iran&apos;s elected government included a share of Iran&apos;s oil wealth { Kinzer, Stephen, Overthrow: America&apos;s Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq (Henry Holt and Company 2006). p. 200–201 } as well as resolute prevention of the slim possibility that the Iranian government might align itself with the Soviet Union, although the latter motivation produces controversy among historians. Washington continually supplied arms to the unpopular Shah, and the CIA-trained SAVAK, his repressive secret police force. The coup is widely believed to have significantly contributed to anti-American sentiment in Iran and the Middle East. The 1979 Iranian Revolution deposed the Shah and replaced the pro-Western royal dictatorship with the largely anti-Western Islamic Republic of Iran. { International Journal of Middle East Studies, 19, 1987, p.261 } [ Background ] [ 19th century ] Throughout the 19th century, Iran was caught between two advancing imperial powers, Russia, which was expanding southward into the Caucasus and central Asia, and Britain, which sought to dominate the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and India. Between 1801 and 1814 Iran signed treaties with Britain and France with an eye toward blocking Russian expansion. After two wars with czarist Russia, from 1804–13 and 1826–28, Iran ceded large tracts of territory to Russia, establishing the modern boundaries between those countries. Britain fought a war with Iran over Afghanistan in 1856–57 after which Afghanistan became independent. In 1892, the British diplomat George Curzon described Iranas &quot; pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a game for the dominion of the world. { Mark J. Gasiorowski, U.S. Foreign Policy and the Shah: Building a Client State in Iran (Cornell University Press: 1991) p. 32; George N. Curzon, Persia and the Persian Question, vol. 1. (London: Cass, 1966) p. 3–4. } In 1872, a representative of Baron Paul Reuter, founder of the news agency, met with Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and agreed to fund the Persian monarch&apos;s upcoming lavish visit to Europe in return for broadly worded concessions in Persia, { Elwell-Sutton, L. P. Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics (Lawrence and Wishart Ltd.: London) 1955. p. 11. } which was the country name through the centuries until 1935 when Reza Shah renamed it Iran. The concession the Shah had given to Reuter was never put into effect because of violent opposition from the Persian people and from Russia. { Elwell-Sutton, L. P. Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics (Lawrence and Wishart Ltd.: London) 1955. p. 12. } [ Early petroleum development ] [ Anglo-Persian Oil Company ] In 1901, Mozzafar al-Din Shah Qajar, the Shah of Persia, granted a 60-year petroleum search concession to William Knox D&apos;Arcy. { All the Shah&apos;s Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, by Stephen Kinzer, (John Wiley and Sons, 2003), p. 33 } D&apos;Arcy paid £20,000, according to journalist-turned-historian Stephen Kinzer, and promised equal ownership shares, with 16% of any future profit. { Kinzer, All the Shah&apos;s Men, p. 48 } However, the historian L.P. Elwell-Sutton wrote, in 1955, that &quot; Persia&apos;s share was &quot; hardly spectacular &quot; and no money changed hands. The (Persian) government was promised 20,000 British pounds in cash and 20,000 in shares in the first company to be formed by the concessionaire. In addition it was to receive 16 per cent of the profits made by this or any other company concerned in the concession. As it turned out D&apos;Arcy did not even have to put his hand in his pocket. The First Exploitation Company was duly formed on 21 May 1903, with an issued capital of 500,000 British pounds in 1 pound shares, 30,000 of which were presented to the Shah and 20,000 to other &quot; leading personalities &quot;. The additional 30,000 in shares was felt to be adequate to take the place of the promised 20,000 pounds in cash, and so no cash payment was ever made. The remainder of the shares were issued in London. { Elwell-Sutton, L. P. Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics (Lawrence and Wishart Ltd.: London) 1955. p. 15 } On 31 July 1907, D&apos;Arcy withdrew from his private holdings in Persia. &quot; A new agreement was signed under which he transferred to the Burmah Oil Company all his shares in the First Exploitation Company, and with them his last direct interest in the exploitation of oil in Persia. &quot; { Elwell-Sutton, L. P. Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics p. 17 } D&apos;Arcy received 203,067 British pounds in cash (more than ten times what the Persian monarch was supposed to have received in cash for the concession) and D&apos;Arcy received 900,000 shares in the Burmah Oil Company, which the historian Elwell-Sutton declared was &quot; a large sum. &quot; In early 1908, the British-owned Burmah Oil Company decided to end its exploration for oil in Persia but on 26 May, oil came in at a depth of [ 1180 ft m ], &quot; a gusher that shot fifty feet or more above the top of the rig, &quot; Elwell-Sutton wrote. &quot; So began the industry that was to see the Royal Navy through two world wars, and to cause Persia more trouble than all the political manoeuvrings of the great powers put together. &quot; { Elwell-Sutton, L. P. Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics p. 19 } The company grew slowly until World War I, when Persia&apos;s strategic importance led the British government to buy a controlling share in the company, essentially nationalizing British oil production in Iran. It became the Royal Navy&apos;s chief fuel source during the war. [ April 2010 ] The British angered Iranians by intervening in Iranian domestic affairs including in the Persian Constitutional Revolution (the transition from dynastic to parliamentary government). { Mangol Bayat, Iran&apos;s First Revolution: Shi&apos;ism and the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1909, Studies in Middle Eastern History, 336 p.

ISBN 0-231-10351-4 } [ Post-World War I ] The Persians were dissatisfied with the royalty terms of the British petroleum concession, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), whereby Persia received 16% of net profits. { Stephen Kinzer : &quot; } { All the Shah&apos;s Men. An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror &quot;, John Wiley and Sons, 2003. } In 1921, a military coup d&apos;état— &quot; widely believed to be a British attempt to enforce, at least, the spirit of the Anglo-Persian agreement &quot; effected with the &quot; financial and logistical support of British military personnel &quot; —permitted the political emergence of Reza Pahlavi, whom they enthroned as the &quot; Shah of Iran &quot; in 1925. The Shah modernized Persia to the advantage of the British; one result was the Persian Corridor railroad for British military and civil transport during World War II. { Coup d&apos;Etat 1299/1921 in the } { Encyclopaedia Iranica, retrieved 8 July 2008. } In the 1930s, the Shah tried to terminate the APOC concession, but Britain would not allow it. The concession was renegotiated on terms again favorable to the British. On 21 March 1935, Pahlavi changed the name of the country from Persia to Iran. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was then renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). { Mackey, Iranians, Plume, (1998), p.178 } [ World War II ] In 1941, after the Nazi invasion of the USSR, the British and Commonwealth of Nations forces and the Red Army invaded Iran, to secure petroleum (cf. Persian Corridor ) for the Soviet Union &apos;s effort against the Nazis on the Eastern Front and for the British elsewhere. Britain and the USSR deposed and exiled the pro-Nazi Shah Reza, and enthroned his 22-year-old son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, as the Shah of Iran. The British secured the oilfields and the seaports. [ Compton McKenzie Eastern Epic 1 Chatto &amp; Windus, London 1951 131–134 ] During the war, Iran was used as a conduit for materiel to the USSR. US forces also entered the country replacing the British in operating the southern part of the Trans-Iranian Railway. [ Post-World War II ] The western Allies withdrew from Iran after the end of the war. The Soviet Union remained and sponsored two &quot; People&apos;s Democratic Republic &quot; s within Iran&apos;s borders. The resulting crisis was resolved through diplomatic efforts in the new United Nations and US support for the Iranian army to reassert control over the breakaway areas. The Soviet-Iranian oil agreement was not ratified. After the war, nationalist leaders in Iran became influential by seeking a reduction in long-term foreign interventions in their country—especially the oil concession which was very profitable for Britain and not very profitable to Iran. The British-controlled AIOC refused to allow its books to be audited to determine whether the Iranian government was being paid what had been promised. British intransigence irked the Iranian population. U.S. objectives in the Middle East remained the same between 1947 and 1952 but its strategy changed. Washington remained &quot; publicly in solidarity and privately at odds &quot; with Britain, its World War II ally. Britain&apos;s empire was steadily weakening, and with an eye on international crises, the U.S. re-appraised its interests and the risks of being identified with British colonial interests. &quot; In Saudi Arabia, to Britain&apos;s extreme disapproval, Washington endorsed the arrangement between ARAMCO and Saudi Arabia in the 50/50 accord that had reverberations throughout the region. &quot; { Notes From the Minefield: United States Intervention in Lebanon and the Middle East, 1945–1958 by } { Boston University } { political science Professor Irene L. Gendzier, (Westview Press, 1999) ISBN 978-0-8133-6689-0 p. 34–35 } Britain faced the newly elected nationalist government in Iran where Mossadegh, with strong backing of the Iranian parliament, demanded more favorable concessionary arrangements, which Britain vigorously opposed. The U.S. State Department not only rejected Britain&apos;s demand that it continue to be the primary beneficiary of Iranian oil reserves but &quot; U.S. international oil interests were among the beneficiaries of the concessionary arrangements that followed nationalization. &quot; { Notes From the Minefield: United States Intervention in Lebanon and the Middle East, 1945–1958 by } { Boston University } { political science Professor Irene L. Gendzier, (Westview Press, 1999) ISBN 978-0-8133-6689-0 p. 35 } U.S. reluctance to overthrow Prime Minister Mossadegh in 1951, when he was elected, faded 28 months later when Dwight D. Eisenhower was in the White House and John Foster Dulles took the helm at the State Department. &quot; Anglo-American cooperation on that occasion brought down the Iranian prime minister and reinstated a U.S.-backed shah. &quot; [ 1950s ] [ Abadan Crisis Abadan Crisis timeline ] { Mohammad Mosaddegh shaking hands with } { Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi } In 1951, the AIOC&apos;s resistance to re-negotiating their petroleum concession—and increasing the royalty paid to Iran—created popular support for nationalising the company. In March, the pro-Western PM Ali Razmara was assassinated; the next month, the parliament legislated the petroleum industry&apos;s nationalisation, by creating the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). This legislation was guided by the Western-educated Dr. Mohammad Mosaddegh, then a member of the Iranian parliament and leader of the nationalisation movement; by May, the Shah had appointed Mosaddegh Prime Minister. Mohammad Mosaddegh attempted to negotiate with the AIOC, but the company rejected his proposed compromise. Mosaddegh&apos;s plan, based on the 1948 compromise between the Venezuela n Government of Romulo Gallegos and Creole Petroleum, { Chatfield, Wayne, The Creole Petroleum Corporation in Venezuela Ayer Publishing 1976 p. 29 } would divide the profits from oil 50/50 between Iran and Britain. Against the recommendation of the United States, Britain refused this proposal and began planning to undermine and overthrow the Iranian government. That summer, American diplomat Averell Harriman went to Iran to negotiate an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah&apos;s help; his reply was that &quot; in the face of public opinion, there was no way he could say a word against nationalisation &quot;. { Kinzer, Stephen, All the Shah&apos;s Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.106 } Harriman held a press conference in Tehran, calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the &quot; nationalisation crisis &quot;. As soon as he spoke, a journalist rose and shouted: &quot; We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mosaddegh and oil nationalisation! &quot; Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay. The National Iranian Oil Company suffered decreased production, because of Iranian inexperience and the AIOC&apos;s orders that British technicians not work with them, thus provoking the Abadan Crisis that was aggravated by the Royal Navy &apos;s blockading its export markets to pressure Iran to not nationalise its petroleum. The Iranian revenues were greater, because the profits went to Iran&apos;s national treasury rather than to private, foreign oil companies. By September 1951, the British had virtually ceased Abadan oil field production, forbidden British export to Iran of key British commodities (including sugar and steel), { Kinzer, All the Shah&apos;s Men (2003) p.110 } and had frozen Iran&apos;s hard currency accounts in British banks. { Abrahamian, (1982) p.268 } The United Kingdom took its anti-nationalisation case against Iran to the International Court of Justice at The Hague; PM Mosaddegh said the world would learn of a &quot; cruel and imperialistic country &quot; stealing from a &quot; needy and naked people &quot;. Representing the AIOC, the UK lost its case. In August 1952, Iranian Prime Minister Mosaddegh invited an American oil executive to visit Iran and the Truman administration welcomed the invitation. However, the suggestion upset British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who insisted that the U.S. not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh: &quot; Britain was supporting the Americans in Korea, he reminded Truman, and had a right to expect Anglo-American unity on Iran. &quot; { Stephen Kinzer : } { All the Shah&apos;s Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.145 } In mid-1952, Britain&apos;s boycott of Iranian oil was devastatingly effective. British agents in Tehran &quot; worked to subvert &quot; the government of Mosaddegh, who sought help from President Truman and then the World Bank but to no avail. &quot; Iranians were becoming poorer and unhappier by the day &quot; and Mosaddegh&apos;s political coalition was fraying. In the Majlis election in the spring of 1952, Mosaddegh &quot; had little to fear from a free vote, since despite the country&apos;s problems, he was widely admired as a hero. A free vote, however, was not what others were planning. British agents had fanned out across the country, bribing candidates, and the regional bosses who controlled them. They hoped to fill the Majlis with deputies who would vote to depose Mosaddegh. It would be a coup carried out by seemingly legal means. &quot; { All the Shah&apos;s Men p. 135, 2008 edition ISBN 978-0-470-18549-0 } While the National Front, which often supported Mosaddegh won handily in the big cities, there was no one to monitor voting in the rural areas. Violence broke out in Abadan and other parts of the country where elections were hotly contested. Faced with having to leave Iran for The Hague where Britain was suing for control of Iranian oil, Mossadegh&apos;s cabinet voted to postpone the remainder of the election until after the return of the Iranian delegation from The Hague. { All the Shah&apos;s Men p. 136–37 2008 edition ISBN 978-0-470-18549-0 } By mid-1953 a mass of resignations by Mossadegh&apos;s parliamentary supporters reduced parliament below its quorum. A referendum to dissolve parliament and give the prime minister power to make law was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99.9 percent approval, 2,043,300 votes to 1300 votes against. { Abrahamian, Iran between 2 Revolutions, 1982, (p.274) } While Mosaddegh dealt with political challenge, he faced another that most Iranians considered far more urgent. The British blockade of Iranian seaports meant that Iran was left without access to markets where it could sell its oil. The embargo had the effect of causing Iran to spiral into bankruptcy. Tens of thousands had lost their jobs at the Abadan refinery, and although most understood and passionately supported the idea of nationalisation, they naturally hoped that Mosaddegh would find a way to put them back to work. The only way he could do that was to sell oil. &quot; { All the Shah&apos;s Men p. 136–7 2008 edition ISBN 978-0-470-18549-0 } Worried about Britain&apos;s other interests in Iran, and believing that Iran&apos;s nationalism was Soviet-backed, Britain persuaded Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that Iran was falling to the Soviets—effectively exploiting the American Cold War mindset. While President Harry S. Truman was busy fighting a war in Korea, he did not agree to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, in 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, the UK convinced him to a joint coup d&apos;état. [ U.S. role ] [ Execution of Operation Ajax ] Having obtained the Shah&apos;s concurrence, the CIA executed the coup. { Gasiorowski, M. J., (1987) &quot; The 1953 Coup d&apos;Etat in Iran. &quot; } { International Journal of Middle East Studies, vol.19 pp.261–286. } Firmans (royal decrees) dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing Zahedi were drawn up by the coup plotters and signed by the Shah. On Saturday 15 August, Colonel Nematollah Nassiri, the commander of the Imperial Guard, delivered to Mosaddegh a firman from the Shah dismissing him. Mosaddegh, who had been warned of the plot (probably by the Tudeh party) rejected the firman as a forgery and had Nassiri arrested. [ Gasiorowski Mark J.

Oil, Power, and Principle: Iran&apos;s Oil Nationalization and Its Aftermath, p 333. Syracuse University Press } The action was publicized within Iran by the CIA and in the United States by The New York Times. The Shah, fearing a popular backlash, fled to Rome, Italy. After a short exile in Italy, the CIA completed the coup against Mossadegh, and returned the Shah to Iran. Alan Dulles, the director of the CIA, flew back with the Shah from Rome to Teheran. { What&apos;s Behind the Crises in Iran and Afghanistan by E Ahmed—1980 } Gen.

Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi, who had been arrested and imprisoned by the British during World War II for his attempt to establish a pro- Nazi government, was made Prime Minister on 19 August 1953. The CIA gave Zahedi about $100,000 before the coup and an additional $5  million the day after the coup to help consolidate support for the coup. Bahram Shahrokh, a trainee of Joseph Goebbels and Berlin Radio&apos;s Persian-language program announcer during the Nazi rule, became director of propaganda. Mr. Sharif-Emami, who also had spent some time in jail for his pro-Nazi activities in the 1940s, assumed several positions after 1953 coup, including Secretary General of the Oil Industry, President of the Senate, and Prime Minister (twice).

The historian, Nick Cullather, said he believed that records on other major cold war covert operations had been burned, including those on secret missions in Indonesia in the 1950s and a successful C.I.A.-sponsored coup in Guyana in the early 1960s. &apos;Iran—there&apos;s nothing&apos;, Mr. Cullather said. &apos;Indonesia—very little. Guyana—that was burned. According to Donald Wilber one of the CIA officers who planned the 1953 coup in Iran wrote an account titled, Clandestine Service History Overthrow Of Premier Mossadeq of Iran: November 1952 – August 1953. Wilber said one goal of the coup was to strengthen the Shah. In 2000, James Risen at The New York Times obtained the previously secret CIA version of the coup written by Wilber and summarized { &quot; Secrets Of History: The C.I.A. in Iran—A special report.

In early August, the C.I.A. stepped up the pressure. Iranian operatives pretending to be Communists threatened Muslim leaders with savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh, seeking to stir anti-Communist sentiment in the religious community. In addition, the secret history says, the house of at least one prominent Muslim was bombed by C.I.A. agents posing as Communists. It does not say whether anyone was hurt in this attack. The agency was also intensifying its propaganda campaign. A leading newspaper owner was granted a personal loan of about $45,000, in the belief that this would make his organ amenable to our purposes. But the shah remained intransigent. In an Aug. 1 meeting with General Norman Schwarzkopf, he refused to sign the C.I.A.-written decrees firing Mr. Mossadegh and appointing General Zahedi. He said he doubted that the army would support him in a showdown.

Middle East historian Ervand Abrahamian identified the coup d&apos;état as &quot; a classic case of nationalism clashing with imperialism in the Third World &quot;. He states that Secretary of State Dean Acheson admitted the Communist threat&apos; was a smokescreen &quot; in responding to President Eisenhower&apos;s claim that the Tudeh party was about to assume power. [ The 1953 Coup in Iran, Science &amp; Society, Vol. 65, No. 2, Summer 2001, pp.182–215 http://www.geocities.com/thelasian/1953-coup-Iran-CIA.html http://www.webcitation.org/5kg6nFIXE 20 October 2009 yes ] { Throughout the crisis, the &quot; communist danger &quot; was more of a rhetorical device than a real issue—i.e. it was part of the cold-war discourse...The Tudeh was no match for the armed tribes and the 129,000-man military. What is more, the British and Americans had enough inside information to be confident that the party had no plans to initiate armed insurrection. At the beginning of the crisis, when the Truman administration was under the impression a compromise was possible, Acheson had stressed the communist danger, and warned if Mosaddegh was not helped, the Tudeh would take over. The (British) Foreign Office had retorted that the Tudeh was no real threat. But, in August 1953, when the Foreign Office echoed the Eisenhower administration&apos;s claim that the Tudeh was about to take over, Acheson now retorted that there was no such communist danger. Acheson was honest enough to admit that the issue of the Tudeh was a smokescreen. } Abrahamian states that Iran&apos;s oil was the central focus of the coup, for both the British and the Americans, though &quot; much of the discourse at the time linked it to the Cold War &quot;. Abrahamian wrote, &quot; If Mosaddegh had succeeded in nationalizing the British oil industry in Iran, that would have set an example and was seen at that time by the Americans as a threat to U.S. oil interests throughout the world, because other countries would do the same. &quot; Mosaddegh did not want any compromise solution that allowed a degree of foreign control. Abrahamian said that Mosaddegh &quot; wanted real nationalization, both in theory and practice &quot;. { Democracy Now. Goodman-Abrahamian interview. } Tirman points out that agricultural land owners were politically dominant in Iran, well into the 1960s and the monarch, Reza Pahlevi&apos;s aggressive land expropriation policies—to the benefit of himself and his supporters—resulted in the Iranian government being Iran&apos;s largest land owner. &quot; The landlords and oil producers had new backing, moreover, as American interests were for the first time exerted in Iran. The Cold War was starting, and Soviet challenges were seen in every leftist movement. But the reformers were at root nationalists, not communists, and the issue that galvanized them above all others was the control of oil. &quot; { Spoils of War: The Human Cost of America&apos;s Arms Trade by John Tirman (Free Press 1997) P. 30 ISBN 978-0-684-82726-1 } The belief that oil was the central motivator behind the coup has been echoed in the popular media by authors such as Robert Byrd, [ Byrd Robert Losing America: confronting a reckless and arrogant presidency W.

The Cold War was at its height in the early 1950s, and the Soviet Union was viewed as an expansionist power seeking world domination. Eisenhower had made the Soviet threat a key issue in the 1952 elections, accusing the Democrats of being soft on communism and of having &quot; lost China. &quot; Once in power, the new administration quickly sought to put its views into practice. &quot; [ Gasiorowski Mark J The 1953 Coup D&apos;etat in Iran The 1953 Coup D&apos;etat in Iran August 1987 International Journal of Middle East Studies Cambridge University Press 19 3 pp. 261–286 163655 ] { A version is available for public access at Web publication accessed from Document Revision: 1.4 Last Updated: 1998/08/23. Its is archived at Archived 19 June 2009. } Gasiorowski further states &quot; the major U.S. oil companies were not interested in Iran at this time. A glut existed in the world oil market. The U.S. majors had increased their production in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1951 in order to make up for the loss of Iranian production; operating in Iran would force them to cut back production in these countries which would create tensions with Saudi and Kuwaiti leaders. Furthermore, if nationalist sentiments remained high in Iran, production there would be risky. U.S. oil companies had shown no interest in Iran in 1951 and 1952. By late 1952, the Truman administration had come to believe that participation by U.S. companies in the production of Iranian oil was essential to maintain stability in Iran and keep Iran out of Soviet hands. In order to gain the participation of the major U.S. oil companies, Truman offered to scale back a large anti-trust case then being brought against them. The Eisenhower administration shared Truman&apos;s views on the participation of U.S. companies in Iran and also agreed to scale back the anti-trust case. Thus, not only did U.S. majors not want to participate in Iran at this time, it took a major effort by U.S. policymakers to persuade them to become involved. &quot; In 2004, Gasiorowski edited a book on the coup arguing that &quot; the climate of intense cold war rivalry between the superpowers, together with Iran&apos;s strategic vital location between the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf oil fields, led U.S. officials to believe that they had to take whatever steps were necessary to prevent Iran from falling into Soviet hands. &quot; While &quot; these concerns seem vastly overblown today &quot; the pattern of &quot; the 1945–46 Azerbaijan crisis, the consolidation of Soviet control in Eastern Europe, the communist triumph in China, and the Korean War —and with the Red Scare at its height in the United States &quot; would not allow U.S. officials to risk allowing the Tudeh Party to gain power in Iran. Furthermore, &quot; U.S. officials believed that resolving the oil dispute was essential for restoring stability in Iran, and after March 1953 it appeared that the dispute could be resolved only at the expense either of Britain or of Mosaddeq. &quot; He concludes &quot; it was geostrategic considerations, rather than a desire to destroy Mosaddeq&apos;s movement, to establish a dictatorship in Iran or to gain control over Iran&apos;s oil, that persuaded U.S. officials to undertake the coup. &quot; { Gasiorowski, Mosaddeq, p.274 } Faced with choosing between British interests and Iran, the U.S. chose Britain, Gasiorowski said. &quot; Britain was the closest ally of the United States, and the two countries were working as partners on a wide range of vitally important matters throughout the world at this time. Preserving this close relationship was more important to U.S. officials than saving Mosaddeq&apos;s tottering regime. &quot; A year earlier, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill used Britain&apos;s support for the U.S. in the Cold War to insist the United States not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh. &quot; Britain was supporting the Americans in Korea, he reminded Truman, and had a right to expect `Anglo-American unity` on Iran. &quot; { Kinzer, All the Shah&apos;s Men, (2003), p.145 } The two main winners of World War II who had been Allies during the war became superpowers and competitors as soon as the war ended, each with their own spheres of influence and client states. After the 1953 coup, Iran became one of the client states of the United States. In his earlier book, U.S. Foreign Policy and the Shah: Building a Client State in Iran Gasiorowski identifies the client states of the United States and of the Soviet Union between 1954–1977. Gasiorowski identified Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Cambodia, Iran, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, South Korea, South Vietnam, Taiwan as strong client states of the United States and identified those that were moderately important to the U.S. as Greece, Turkey, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Paraguay, Liberia, Zaire, Israel, Jordan, Tunisia, Pakistan and Thailand. He identified Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ethiopia and Japan as &quot; weak &quot; client states of the United States. { U.S. Foreign Policy and the Shah: Building a Client State in Iran by Mark J. Gasiorowski (Cornell University Press: 1991) p. 27. } Gasiorowski identified Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, Cuba, Mongolia and North Vietnam as &quot; strong client states &quot; of the Soviet Union, and he identified Guinea, Somalia, Egypt, Syria, Afghanistan and North Korea as moderately important client states. Mali and South Yemen were classified as weak client states of the Soviet Union. According to Kinzer, for most Americans, the crisis in Iran became just part of the conflict between Communism and &quot; the Free world. &quot; { Kinzer, All the Shah&apos;s Men (2003), p.84 } &quot; A great sense of fear, particularly the fear of encirclement, shaped American consciousness during this period.... Soviet power had already subdued Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia. Communist governments were imposed on Bulgaria and Romania in 1946, Hungary and Poland in 1947, and Czechoslovakia in 1948. Albania and Yugoslavia also turned to communism. Greek communists made a violent bid for power. Soviet soldiers blocked land routes to Berlin for sixteen months. In 1949 the Soviet Union successfully tested a nuclear weapon. That same year, pro-Western forces in China lost their civil war to communists led by Mao Zedong. From Washington, it seemed that enemies were on the march everywhere. &quot; Consequently, &quot; the United States, challenged by what most Americans saw as a relentless communist advance, slowly ceased to view Iran as a country with a unique history that faced a unique political challenge. &quot; { Kinzer, All the Shah&apos;s Men, (2003), p.205 } Some historians including Douglas Little, [ Little Douglas American orientalism: the United States and the Middle East since 1945 I.B.Tauris 2003 216 1-86064-889-4, 9781860648892 http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dp71CacOnop0C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA216 18 March 2011 ] Abbas Milani [ Milani Abbas Eminent Persians: the men and women who made modern Iran, 1941–1979 : Syracuse University Press, 2008 Volume 1 0-8156-0907-8, 9780815609070 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DixU33FaG_dgC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA244 18 March 2011 ] and George Lenczowski [ Lenczowski, George American Presidents and the Middle East, Duke University Press, 1990 36 0-8223-0972-6, 9780822309727 ] have echoed the view that fears of a communist takeover or Soviet influence motivated the U.S. to intervene. [ U.S. media coverage ] The Editors of the &quot; agenda setting &quot; [ May 2012 ] New York Times declared on August 6, 1954, that all of this was &quot; good news indeed &quot; : &quot; Costly as the dispute over Iranian oil has been to all concerned, the affair may yet be proved worthwhile if lessons are learned from it: Underdeveloped countries with rich resources now have an object lesson in the heavy cost that must be paid by one of their number which goes berserk with fanatical nationalism. It is perhaps too much to hope that Iran&apos;s experience will prevent the rise of Mossadeghs in other countries, but that experience may at least strengthen the hands of more reasonable and more far-seeing leaders. &quot; { &quot; THE IRANIAN ACCORD &quot; The New York Times, 1954 } When Mossadegh was in office, the editors of the New York Times gave the opinion that: &quot; A plebiscite more fantastic and farcical than any ever held under Hitler or Stalin is now being staged in Iran by Premier Mossadegh in an effort to make himself unchallenged dictator of the country. &quot; { &quot; The U.S. Press and Iran: Foreign Policy and the Journalism of Deference &quot; By William A. Dorman, Mansour Farhang, Aug 24, 1988 } When the Shah was in power, the editors of the New York Times wrote: &quot; The great mass of the Iranian people are doubtless behind the Shah in his bold new reform efforts. The national plebiscite he called early this year gave emphatic evidence of this. &quot; { &quot; A Victory for the Shah &quot; The New York Times (subscription required) } [ Aftermath ] The coup has been said to have &quot; left a profound and long-lasting legacy. &quot; { Abrahamian, Ervand, A History of Modern Iran, p.122 } { Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p.122 } [ Blowback ] According to the history based on documents released to the National Security Archive and reflected in the book Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, the coup caused long-lasting damage to the U.S. reputation. &quot; The &apos;28 Mordad&apos; coup, as it is known by its Persian date, was a watershed for Iran, for the Middle East and for the standing of the United States in the region. The joint U.S.-British operation ended Iran&apos;s drive to assert sovereign control over its own resources and helped put an end to a vibrant chapter in the history of the country&apos;s nationalist and democratic movements. These consequences resonated with dramatic effect in later years. When the Shah finally fell in 1979, memories of the U.S. intervention in 1953, which made possible the monarch&apos;s subsequent, and increasingly unpopular, 25-year reign intensified the anti-American character of the revolution in the minds of many Iranians. &quot; [ America&apos;s Role in Iran&apos;s Unrest Dowlin Joan E. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joan-e-dowlin/americas-role-in-irans-un_b_216831.html Huffington Post USA 17 June 2009 21 June 2009 ] { Quoting from Gasiorowski and Byrne, Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran. } The authoritarian monarch installed in the coup appreciated the coup, Kermit Roosevelt wrote in his account of the affair. &quot; &apos;I owe my throne to God, my people, my army and to you!&apos; By &apos;you&apos; he [the shah] meant me and the two countries—Great Britain and the United States—I was representing.

We united with the British to destroy him; we succeeded; and ever since, our name has not been an honored one in the Middle East. &quot; { Kinzer, Stephen, Overthrow: America&apos;s Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq (Henry Holt and Company 2006). p. 200 } [ Iran ] An immediate consequence of the coup d&apos;état was the repression of all political dissent, especially the liberal and nationalist opposition umbrella group National Front as well as the (Communist) Tudeh party, and concentration of political power in the Shah and his courtiers. { Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, (University of California 1999) } The minister of Foreign Affairs and the closest associate of Mosaddegh, Hossein Fatemi, was executed by order of the Shah&apos;s military court by firing squad on 10 November 1954. { New York Times. 11 November 1954, p.5 } According to Kinzer, &quot; The triumphant Shah [Pahlavi] ordered the execution of several dozen military officers and student leaders who had been closely associated with Mohammad Mossadegh &quot; { Overthrow: America&apos;s Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq by Stephen Kinzer (Henry Holt and Company 2006). p. 200. ISBN /9780805082401 } As part of the post-coup d&apos;état political repression between 1953–1958, the Shah outlawed the National Front, and arrested most of its leaders. { Iran in Revolution: The Opposition Forces by E Abrahamian – MERIP Reports } The Tudeh, however, bore the main brunt of the repression. [ Abrahamian Ervand http://books.google.com/?id%3D_mnrYNIVfCgC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA92 Tortured Confessions University of California Press 1999 84 978-0-520-21866-6 18 March 2011 ] The Shah&apos;s security forces arrested 4,121 Tudeh political activists including 386 civil servants, 201 college students, 165 teachers, 125 skilled workers, 80 textile workers, 60 cobblers, and 11 housewives [ this figure of 11 housewives in not in the cited source December 2010 ]. { Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, (University of California), 1999, p.89-90 } Forty were executed, another 14 died under torture and over 200 were sentenced to life imprisonment. The Shah&apos;s post-coup dragnet also captured 477 Tudeh members ( &quot; 22 colonels, 69 majors, 100 captains, 193 lieutenants, 19 noncommissioned officers, and 63 military cadets &quot; ) who were in the Iranian armed forces. After their presence was revealed, some National Front supporters complained that this Tudeh military network could have saved Mosaddegh. However, few Tudeh officers commanded powerful field units, especially tank divisions that might have countered the coup. Most of the captured Tudeh officers came from the military academies, police and medical corps. [ Abrahamian Ervand http://books.google.com/books?id%3D_mnrYNIVfCgC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA92 Tortured Confessions University of California Press 1999 92 978-0-520-21866-6 18 March 2011 ] { Abrahamian, Ervand, Iran Between Two Revolutions, 1982, p.92 } At least eleven of the captured army officers were tortured to death between 1953 and 1958. After the 1953 coup, the Shah&apos;s government formed the SAVAK (secret police), many of whose agents were trained in the United States. The SAVAK was given a &quot; loose leash &quot; to torture suspected dissidents with &quot; brute force &quot; that, over the years, &quot; increased dramatically &quot;. { Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, (University of California), 1999, pp. 88, 105 } Another effect was sharp improvement of Iran&apos;s economy; the British-led oil embargo against Iran ended, and oil revenue increased significantly beyond the pre-nationalisation level. Despite Iran not controlling its national oil, the Shah agreed to replacing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company with a consortium—British Petroleum and eight European and American oil companies; in result, oil revenues increased from $34  million in 1954–1955 to $181  million in 1956–1957, and continued increasing, { Abrahamian, Ervand, Iran between Revolutions, (Princeton University Press, 1982), pp.419–20 } and the United States sent development aid and advisors. In the 1970s the Shah&apos;s government increased taxes that foreign companies were obliged to pay from 50% to 80% and royalty payments from 12.5% to 20%. At the same time the price of oil reverted to Iranian control. Oil companies now only earned 22 cents per barrel of oil. { Oil company history } Jacob G. Hornberger, founder and president, of The Future of Freedom Foundation, said, &quot; U.S. officials, not surprisingly, considered the operation one of their greatest foreign policy successes—until, that is, the enormous convulsion that rocked Iranian society with the violent ouster of the Shah and the installation of a virulently anti-American Islamic regime in 1979 &quot;. { Washington&apos;s wise advice. Ralph R. Reiland. } { Pittsburgh Tribune Review 30 July 2007. } According to him, &quot; the coup, in essence, paved the way for the rise to power of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and all the rest that&apos;s happened right up to 9/11 and beyond &quot;. [ Internationally ] Kinzer wrote that the 1953 coup d&apos;état was the first time the U.S. used the CIA to overthrow a democratically elected, civil government. { Stephen Kinzer : } { All the Shah&apos;s Men. An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, John Wiley and Sons, 2003 } The Eisenhower administration viewed Operation Ajax as a success, with &quot; immediate and far-reaching effect. Overnight, the CIA became a central part of the American foreign policy apparatus, and covert action came to be regarded as a cheap and effective way to shape the course of world events &quot; —a coup engineered by the CIA called Operation PBSUCCESS toppling the duly elected Guatemala n government of Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán, which had nationalised farm land owned by the United Fruit Company, followed the next year. { Stephen Kinzer : } { All the Shah&apos;s Men. An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.209 } A pro-American government in Iran doubled the United States&apos; geographic and strategic advantage in the Middle East, as Turkey, also bordering the USSR, was part of NATO. { Turkey joined [[NATO ] in 1952.] } In 2000 U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, acknowledged the coup&apos;s pivotal role in the troubled relationship and &quot; came closer to apologizing than any American official ever has before &quot;. The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons.... But the coup was clearly a setback for Iran&apos;s political development. And it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America in their internal affairs. { A short account of 1953 Coup } In June 2009, the U.S. President Barack Obama in a speech in Cairo, Egypt, talked about the United States&apos; relationship with Iran, mentioning the role of the U.S. in 1953 Iranian coup saying: [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/04/barack-obama-keynote-speech-egypt Barack Obama&apos;s Cairo speech The Guardian UK 5 June 2009 June 4, 2009 http://web.archive.org/web/20090611192419/http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/04/barack-obama-keynote-speech-egypt 11 June 2009 no ] [ Historical viewpoint in the Islamic Republic ] Men associated with Mossadegh and his ideals dominated Iran&apos;s first post-revolutionary government. The first prime minister after the Iranian revolution was Mehdi Bazargan, a close associate of Mossadegh. But with the subsequent rift between the conservative Islamic establishment and the secular liberal forces, Mossadegh&apos;s work and legacy has been largely ignored by the Islamic Republic establishment. { Kinzer, Stephen. All the Shah&apos;s Men. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008, p. 258 } However, Mosaddegh remains a popular historical figure among Iranian opposition factions. Mosaddegh&apos;s image is one of the symbols of Iran&apos;s opposition movement, also known as the Green Movement. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jun/19/iran-protests-mousavi-mossadeq Democracy, made in Iran Kinzer Stephen 22 June 2009 The Guardian UK Guardian News and Media Limited 12 December 2010 ] Kinzer writes that Mosaddegh &quot; for most Iranians &quot; is &quot; the most vivid symbol of Iran&apos;s long struggle for democracy &quot; and that modern protesters carrying a picture of Mosaddegh is the equivalent of saying &quot; We want democracy &quot; and &quot; No foreign intervention &quot;. In the Islamic Republic, remembrance of the coup is quite different than that of history books published in the West, and follows the precepts of Ayatollah Khomeini that Islamic jurists must guide the country to prevent &quot; the influence of foreign powers &quot;. { Hamid Algar&apos;s book, Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini, ed by Hamid Algar, Mizan, 1981, p.54 } According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, the government tries to ignore Mosaddegh as much as possible and allocates him only two pages in high school textbooks. &quot; The mass media elevate Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani as the real leader of the oil nationalization campaign, depicting Mosaddegh as merely the ayatollah&apos;s hanger-on. &quot; This is despite the fact that Kashani came out against Mosaddegh by mid-1953 and &quot; told a foreign correspondent that Mosaddegh had fallen because he had forgotten that the shah enjoyed extensive popular support. &quot; { Abrahamian, Ervand, Khomeinism : Essays on the Islamic Republic, (University of California Press, c1993). p.109 } A month later, Kashani &quot; went even further and declared that Mosaddegh deserved to be executed because he had committed the ultimate offense: rebelling against the shah, &apos;betraying&apos; the country, and repeatedly violating the sacred law. &quot; { [Cited by Y. Richard, &quot; Ayatollah Kashani: Precursor of the Islamic Republic? &quot; in Religion and Politics in Iran, ed. N. Keddie, (Yale University Press, 1983)] p.  109 } In the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kinzer&apos;s book All the Shah&apos;s Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror has been censored of descriptions of Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani &apos;s activities during the Anglo-American coup d&apos;état. Mahmood Kashani, the son of Abol-Ghasem Kashani, &quot; one of the top members of the current, ruling élite &quot; whom the Iranian Council of Guardians has twice approved to run for the presidency, denies there was a coup d&apos;état in 1953, saying Mosaddegh, himself, was obeying British plans: &quot; In my opinion, Mosaddegh was the director of the British plans and implemented them  ... Without a doubt Mosaddegh had the primary and essential role &quot; { ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) November 2003 interview in Persian with Mahmood Kashani } in the August 1953 coup. Kashani says Mosaddegh, the British and the Americans worked against the Ayatollah Kashani to undermine the role of Shia clerics. { Review Essay of Stephen Kinzer&apos;s All the Shah&apos;s Men, By: Masoud Kazemzadeh, PhD, &apos;&apos;Middle East Policy&apos;&apos;, VOL. XI, NO. 4, winter 2004 } This allegation also is posited in the book Khaterat-e Arteshbod-e Baznesheshteh Hossein Fardoust (The Memoirs of Retired General Hossein Fardoust), published in the Islamic Republic and allegedly written by Hossein Fardoust, a former SAVAK officer. It claims that rather than being a mortal enemy of the British, Mohammad Mosaddegh always favored them, and his nationalisation campaign of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was inspired by &quot; the British themselves &quot;. { Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, (University of California Press, 1999), pp.160–61 } Scholar Ervand Abrahamian suggests that the fact that Fardoust&apos;s death was announced before publication of the book may be significant, as the Islamic Republic authorities may have forced him into writing such statements under duress.
