[ T Pyxidis ] [ 250px Hubble Space Telescope composite of T Pyx ] [ 09 04 41.50 ] [ −32 22 47.5 ] { 6.4-15.5 } { Pyxis } [ White Dwarf Recurrent nova ] [ NOVA Pyx 1890, 2MASS J09044150-3222474. ] T Pyxidis (T Pyx) is a binary star system in the constellation Pyxis estimated at about [ 1000 pc ly off ] from Earth. It contains a sun-like star and a white dwarf. Because of their close proximity and the larger mass of the white dwarf, it draws matter from the larger, less massive star which causes periodic thermonuclear explosions to occur. T Pyx is a recurrent nova [ Shara, Michael M.; Zurek, David R.; Williams, Robert E.; Prialnik, Dina; Gilmozzi, Roberto; Moffat, Anthony F. J.

The usual apparent magnitude of this star system is 15.5, but there occurred eruptions with maximal apparent magnitude of about 7.0 in the years 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1966 and 2011 [ http://www.aavso.org/aavso-alert-notice-436 Outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyx 2011 AAVSO ]. Evidence seems to indicate that T Pyxidis may have increased in mass despite the nova eruptions, and is now close to the Chandrasekhar limit when it might explode as a Supernova.

[ Effect on Earth ] Because of its relative proximity, some contend that a T Pyxidis supernova could have a significant impact on Earth. The received gamma radiation would equal the total (all spectra) radiation of approximately 1000 solar flares, but a type Ia supernova would have to be closer than [ 1000 pc ly off ] to cause significant damage to the ozone layer. The X-radiation that reaches Earth, however, would be less than the X-radiation of a single average solar flare. [ 5 December 2009 Will a Nearby Supernova Endanger Life on Earth? TASS, The Amateur Sky Survey Michael Richmond http://www.tass-survey.org/richmond/answers/snrisks.txt ] However, Dr. Sion&apos;s calculations were challenged by professor Alex Filippenko who said that Sion had possibly miscalculated the damage that could be caused by a T Pyxidis supernova. He had used data for a far more deadly gamma-ray burst (GRB) exploding 1 kilo parsec from Earth, not a supernova, and T Pyxidis certainly is not expected to produce a GRB. According to another expert, &quot; A supernova would have to be 10 times closer [to Earth] to do the damage described. &quot; [ 6 Jan 2010 Will Earth &apos;Be Wiped Out&apos; by a Supernova?

If this star were to explode as a type Ia supernova at its estimated distance of 3300 light-years, it would have an apparent magnitude of around -9.3, about as bright as the brightest Iridium (satellite) flare s. { A type Ia supernova has an absolute magnitude of } { -19.3, which is how bright it would appear 32.6 ly away. This star is 3300 ly away, or roughly 100 times farther. By the inverse square law, it would thus appear 100^2 or 10,000 times dimmer. Each step of 5 magnitudes defined as a factor of 100 in brightness, so 10,000 times dimmer would be 10 magnitudes dimmer, or -9.3. } It has been reported that T. Pyx would &quot; soon &quot; become a supernova,.However, when contacted by Scientific American, Dr Sion said that the term &quot; soon &quot; in the press announcement meant that &quot; At the accretion rate we derived, the white dwarf in T Pyxidis will reach the Chandrasekhar Limit in ten million years. &quot; [ http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id%3Dsupernova-star-too-close-for-comfor-2010-01 Supernova star too close for comfort 5 Jan 2010 Scientific American ] By that time it will have moved far enough away from the solar system to have little effect. { AAVSO } { light curve of } { recurrent nova T Pyx from 1 Jan 1966 to 17 Nov 2010.
