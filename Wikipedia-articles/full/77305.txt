They are wingless, with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood. Fleas are external parasites, living by hematophagy off the blood of mammal s and bird s. Some flea species include: Cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) Dog flea (Ctenocephalides canis) Human flea (Pulex irritans) Moorhen flea (Dasypsyllus gallinulae) Northern rat flea (Nosopsyllus fasciatus) Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) Over 2,000 species have been described worldwide. { Fleas: What They Are, What To Do D. L. Richman and P. G. Koehler, } { University of Florida IFAS Extension. Accessed 10 December 2010 } [ Morphology and behavior ] left Fleas are wingless insects (1/16 to 1/8-inch (1.5 to 3.3  mm) long) that are agile, usually dark colored (for example, the reddish-brown of the cat flea), with tube-like mouth-parts adapted to feeding on the blood of their hosts. Their legs are long, the hind pair well adapted for jumping: a flea can jump vertically up to 7  inches (18  cm) and horizontally up to 13  inches (33  cm). { Fleas, HYG-2081-97 William F. Lyon, } { Ohio State University entomology page. Accessed 28 December 2006 } This is around 1200 to 2200 times their own body length, making the flea one of the best jumpers of all known animals (relative to body size), second only to the froghopper. According to an article in Science News, &quot; researchers with the University of Cambridge in England have shown that fleas take off from their tibiae and tarsi—the insect equivalent of feet—and not their trochantera, or knees. The researchers report their conclusion in the March 1 Journal of Experimental Biology. &quot; { http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/69664/title/Fleas_leap_from_feet%2C_not_knees } It has been known that fleas do not use muscle power but energy stored in a protein named resilin but the researchers used high-speed video technology and mathematical models to discover where the spring action actually happens. Their bodies are laterally compressed, permitting easy movement through the hairs or feathers on the host&apos;s body (or in the case of humans, under clothing). The flea body is hard, polished, and covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward, { Fleas. P.G. Koehler and F. M. Oi. Printed July 1993, revised February 2003. Provided by the } { University of Florida } which also assist its movements on the host. The tough body is able to withstand great pressure, likely an adaptation to survive attempts to eliminate them by mashing or scratching. Even hard squeezing between the fingers is normally insufficient to kill a flea. It is possible to eliminate them by pressing individual fleas with adhesive tape or softened beeswax (or &quot; cheese &quot; wax) or by rolling a flea briskly between the fingers to disable it then crushing it between the fingernails. Fleas also can be drowned in water and may not survive direct contact with anti-flea pesticides. { Hooke&apos;s drawing of a flea in &apos;&apos; } { Micrographia &apos;&apos; } { Micrograph of a flea larva } Fleas lay tiny white oval-shaped eggs better viewed through a loupe. The larva is small, pale, has bristles covering its worm-like body, lacks eyes, and has mouthparts adapted to chewing. The larvae feed on various organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas. The adult flea&apos;s diet consists solely of fresh blood. { Order Siphonaptera – Fleas – BugGuide.Net Accessed 28 December 2006 } In the pupal phase, the larva is enclosed in a silken, debris-covered cocoon. [ Life cycle and habitat ] Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four life cycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). The flea life cycle begins when the female lays after feeding. Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Although reproduction is normally asexual, for at least one specie, under stress conditions, female fleas produce male fleas. { http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/agcomm/magazine/spring05/sex.htm }. Eggs are laid in batches of up to 20 or so, usually on the host itself, which means that the eggs can easily roll onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps become one of the primary habitat s of eggs and developing fleas. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Flea larvae emerge from the eggs to feed on any available organic material such as dead insects, feces, and vegetable matter. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark places like sand, cracks and crevices, and bedding. Given an adequate supply of food, larvae should pupate and weave a silk en cocoon within 1–2 weeks after 3 larval stages. After another week or two, the adult flea is fully developed and ready to emerge from the cocoon. They may however remain resting during this period until they receive a signal that a host is near - vibrations (including sound), heat, and carbon dioxide are all stimuli indicating the probable presence of a host. Fleas are known to overwinter in the larval or pupal stages. Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. { http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/IG087 } Adult fleas only have about a week to find food once they emerge, but after that they can survive two years to three years between meals. Flea populations are evenly distributed, with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults. Their total life cycle can be as short as one year, but may be several years in ideal conditions. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, allowing for phenomenal growth rates. Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, can detect the changing levels of cortisol and corticosterone, hormones in the rabbit&apos;s blood that indicate she is getting close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make their way back to the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth. { Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, } { Greenwood Press. } Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained. However, completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea&apos;s life cycle are 70°F to 85°F (21°C to 30°C) and optimum humidity is 70%. [ Classification ] Cat flea Fleas are related to mecoptera, { Grimaldi, D. and } { Engel, M.S. (2005). Evolution of the Insects. } { Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-82149-5. } winged insects with good eyesight. The flightless boreid (snow scorpionfly) with its rudimentary wings seems to be close to the common ancestor of the 2000 or so known varieties of flea, which split off in many directions around 160 million years ago. Their evolution continued to produce adaptations for their specialized parasitic niche, such that they now have no wings and their eyes are covered over. The large number of flea species may be attributed to the wide variety of host species they feed on, which provides so many specific ecological niche s to adapt to. In the past, it was most commonly supposed that fleas had evolved from the flies ( Diptera ), based on similarities of the larvae. (Some authorities use the name Aphaniptera because it is older, but names above family rank need not follow the ICZN rules of priority, so most taxonomist s use the more familiar name). Genetic and morphological evidence indicates that they are descendants of the Scorpionfly family Boreidae, which are also flightless; accordingly it is possible that they will eventually be reclassified as a suborder within the Mecoptera. In any case, all these groups seem to represent a clade of closely related insect lineages, for which the names Mecopteroidea and Antliophora have been proposed. Flea systematics are not entirely fixed. While, compared to many other insect groups, fleas have been studied and classified fairly thoroughly, details still remain to be learned about the evolution ary relationships among the different flea lineages.

[ Direct effects of bites ] [ Pulicosis ] Fleas are a nuisance to their hosts, causing an itch ing sensation which in turn may result in the host attempting to remove the pest by biting, pecking, scratching, etc. in the vicinity of the parasite. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Some people and animals suffer allergic reactions to flea saliva resulting in rash es. Flea bites generally result in the formation of a slightly raised, swollen itching spot with a single puncture point at the center (similar to a mosquito bite). The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can also lead to hair loss as a result of frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases. [ Medical and Veterinary Entomology Mullen Gary R.

IPM is achieved by targeting fleas during at least two separate life stages, with at least two separate molecules. This is typically achieved using an adulticide to kill adult fleas and an insect development inhibitor (IDI), like lufenuron, or insect growth regulator (IGR), like methoprene, to prevent development of immature stages. Flea adults, larvae, or eggs can be controlled with insecticide s. Lufenuron is a veterinary preparation (known as Program) that attacks the larval flea&apos;s ability to produce chitin, necessary for the adult&apos;s hard exoskeleton, but does not kill fleas so this can be seen as a compassionate method of flea control. Flea medicines need to be used with care because many of them also affect mammals. Cedar oil, a non-toxic natural substance, has been proven effective in the eradication of infestations in pets. Cedar oil is being used to treat sand-flea infestation of US Military forces in the Persian Gulf. [ http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/11/prweb1659224.htm Lights Out For Bed Bugs as &quot; BEST YET &quot; Cedar Oil Solution Solves International Bed Bug Dilemma 2008-11-25 http://www.prweb.com/ 2010-04-08 ] Since more than three quarters of a flea&apos;s life is spent somewhere other than on the host animal, it is not adequate to treat only the host; it is important also to treat the host&apos;s environment. Thorough vacuuming, washing linens in hot water, and treating all hosts in the immediate environment (the entire household, for example) are essential and if possible on a regular basis. { ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/Chem.../cedarwood_oil.pdf } Contemporary commercial products for the topical treatment of flea infestations on pets contain pesticides such as imidacloprid, permethrin, and (S)- methoprene. All flea control products are recommended to be used at least half-yearly because the lifecycle of flea and tick can last to up to 6 months, and by using one of the flea and tick control products for so long, the infestation is highly prevented and, in the end, stopped. Although all these products are effective in fighting against flea and tick infestations, they have different active ingredients and, because cats cannot metabolize some of the compounds of the product, care must be taken in their use. [ For the home ] Combatting a flea infestation in the home takes patience because for every flea found on an animal, there could be many more developing in the home. A spot-on insecticide will kill the fleas on the pet and in turn the pet itself will be a roving flea trap and mop up newly hatched fleas. The environment should be treated with a fogger or spray insecticide containing an insect growth regulator, such as pyriproxyfen or methoprene to kill eggs and pupae, which are quite resistant against insecticides. Frequent vacuuming is also helpful, but the vacuum bag must be disposed of immediately afterwards. Fleas tend to breed exponentially in piles of shoes. Flea &quot; dirt &quot; in the fur of a cat is actually excess blood from the host consumed by the adult flea and passed as feces Diatomaceous earth can also be used as a home flea treatment in lieu of acetylcholinesterase inhibitory treatments or insecticides which carry with them a risk of poisoning for both humans and animals. However, diatomaceous earth is at least potentially dangerous to pets and people when inhaled, so care in use is recommended. Dried pennyroyal has been suggested as a natural flea control, { Natural Flea Control, 1987, Mother Earth News, Retrieved 2007-12-18 } but is not recommended in homes with pets due to its high toxicity to mammals. { &apos;&apos;Warnings About Essential Oils&apos;&apos; } Borax is sold as a &quot; Natural Laundry Booster &quot; and can also be used as another home treatment for flea infestations. Borax contains sodium borate which kills fleas by dehydrating them, but its safety for pets is untested. { Fleas } Using dehumidifier s with air conditioning and vacuuming all may interrupt the flea life cycle. Humidity is critical to flea survival. Eggs need relative humidity of at least 70–75% to hatch, and larvae need at least 50% humidity to survive. In humid areas, about 20% of the eggs survive to adulthood; in arid areas, less than 5% complete the cycle. { Fleas Management Guidelines. Univ. of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Nov. 2000. } Fleas thrive at higher temperatures, but need 70° to 90°F (21° to 32°C) to survive. Lower temperatures slow down or completely interrupt the flea life-cycle. A laboratory study done at the University of California showed that vacuuming catches about 96% of adult fleas. A combination of controlled humidity, temperature, and vacuuming should eliminate fleas from an environment. Altering even one of these environmental factors may be enough to drastically lower and eliminate an infestation.
