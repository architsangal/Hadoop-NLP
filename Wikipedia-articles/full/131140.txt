Lebanon is a home rule municipality, formerly a township, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 33,137 at the 2010 census. An affluent suburb of nearby Pittsburgh, Mt. Lebanon is well known locally and nationally for its excellent school district. Mt. Lebanon High School is one of only 24 non-Private secondary schools in the United States (and the only non-Private school in Pennsylvania) that is a member of the prestigious Cum Laude Society. Established in 1912 as &quot; Mount Lebanon &quot;, the community&apos;s official name was changed to &quot; Mt. Lebanon &quot; when its home rule charter took effect in 1975. [ History ] The first settlers arrived in 1773-1774, having purchased the land from the descendants of William Penn; other pioneers soon bought land from the state government. In 1912, Mount Lebanon Township was incorporated as a &quot; First Class Township &quot; under Pennsylvania state law. It had formerly been a part of Scott Township, which in turn traces its origins to the long-defunct St. Clair Township. Mount Lebanon was not named for two Cedar of Lebanon trees that were planted in 1850 on Washington Road near the top of Bower Hill Road, but was named after the area from which they came, Mount Lebanon, due to the similarities between the two landscapes. [ http://www.hsmtl.org/history-of-mount-lebanon-1/how-mt-lebanon-got-its-name Historical Society of Mt. Lebanon - How Mt. Lebanon Was Named Wallace F. Workmaster September 21, 2006 October 26, 2009 ] Prior to the incorporation of the township, the &quot; Mount Lebanon &quot; name was used for the area of Upper St. Clair Township near the cedar trees. In the 1880s, a post office located near the transplanted cedar trees was named &quot; Mount Lebanon &quot;. Incorporators of neighboring Dormont Borough initially tried to use the &quot; Mount Lebanon &quot; name in 1909, but were opposed by residents of the future Mount Lebanon Township. In 1928, Mount Lebanon became the first First Class township in Pennsylvania to adopt the council-manager form of government and has had an appointed manager serving as the chief administrative officer since that time. Mount Lebanon was a farming community until the arrival of streetcar lines, the first line to Pittsburgh opening on July 1, 1901 [ http://www.mtlebanon.org/index.aspx?nid%3D34 Mt. Lebanon History &amp; Information 9 October 2009 ] followed by a second in 1924. After the arrival of the streetcar lines, which enabled daily commuting to and from Downtown Pittsburgh, Mount Lebanon became a streetcar suburb, with the first real estate subdivision being laid out in November 1901. Further, the opening of the Liberty Tubes in 1924 allowed easy automobile access to Pittsburgh. Between the 1920 and 1930 censuses, the township&apos;s population skyrocketed from 2,258 to 13,403. Today, Pittsburgh&apos;s mass transit agency, the Port Authority Transit of Allegheny County, or &quot; PATransit, &quot; operates a light rail system whose Red Line line runs underneath Uptown Mt.
