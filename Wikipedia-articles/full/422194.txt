[ http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/Hoi%20polloi Roget’s New Millennium Thesaurus Lexico Publishing Group, LLC. 2006-07-12 ] The phrase became known to English scholars probably from Pericles&apos; Funeral Oration, as mentioned in Thucydides &apos; History of the Peloponnesian War. Pericles uses it in a positive way when praising the Athenian democracy, contrasting it with hoi oligoi, &quot; the few &quot; ( Greek : [ grc οἱ ὀλίγοι ], see also oligarchy ) { Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, Book 2.34-46: &quot; } [ grc καὶ ὄνομα μὲν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἐς ὀλίγους ἀλλ᾿ ἐς πλείονας οἰκεῖν δημοκρατία κέκληται ] { &quot; ( &quot; It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few &quot; ). } Its current English usage originated in the early 19th century, a time when it was generally accepted that one must be familiar with Greek and Latin in order to be considered well-educated.

Ancient Greek speakers pronounced it. Notice that double-λ is pronounced as such. Modern Greek speakers pronounce it ee po-LEE, since in Modern Greek there is no aspiration and οι is pronounced &quot; ee &quot; (all Ancient Greek diphthongs are now pronounced as monophthongs ). Greek Cypriots still pronounce the double-λ ( ). [ Usage ] Some linguistic prescriptivists and students of ancient Greek argue that, given that hoi is a definite article, the phrase &quot; the hoi polloi &quot; is redundant, akin to saying &quot; the the masses. &quot; Others argue that this is inconsistent with other English loanwords. The word &quot; alcohol, &quot; for instance, derives from the Arabic al-kuhl, al being an article, yet &quot; the alcohol &quot; is universally accepted as good grammar. { http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/183475.html } [ Appearances in the nineteenth century ] { Lord Byron &apos;s view of the Hoi polloi } There have been numerous uses of the term in English literature. James Fenimore Cooper, author of The Last of the Mohicans, is often credited with making the first recorded usage of the term in English. { American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. } { The Literature Network. } The first recorded use by Cooper occurs in his 1837 work Gleanings in Europe where he writes &quot; After which the oi polloi are enrolled as they can find interest. &quot; { Cooper, James Fenimore Gleanings in Europe: England 1837. } Lord Byron had, in fact, previously used the term in his letters and journal. In one journal entry, dated 24 November 1813, Byron writes &quot; I have not answered W. Scott &apos;s last letter,—but I will. I regret to hear from others, that he has lately been unfortunate in pecuniary involvements. He is undoubtedly the Monarch of Parnassus, and the most English of bards. I should place Rogers next in the living list (I value him more as the last of the best school) — Moore and Campbell both third— Southey and Wordsworth and Coleridge —the rest, οι πολλοί [hoi polloi in Greek]—thus:— (see image reproduced on this page).

S. Gilbert used the term in 1882 when he wrote the libretto of the comic opera Iolanthe. In Act I, the following exchange occurs between a group of disgruntled fairies who are arranging to elevate a lowly shepherd to the peerage, and members of the House of Lords who will not hear of such a thing. You shall not quench With base canaille! FAIRIES: (That word is French.) Before a herd Of vulgar plebs! FAIRIES: (A Latin word.) And madness stark The hoi polloi! FAIRIES: (A Greek remark.) Gilbert&apos;s parallel use of canaille, plebs (plebeians), and hoi polloi makes it clear that the term is derogatory of the lower classes. In many versions of the vocal score, it is written as &quot; οἱ πολλοί, &quot; likely confusing generations of amateur choristers who had not had the advantages of a British Public School education. John Dryden used the phrase in his Essay of Dramatick Poesie, published in 1668. Dryden spells the phrase with Greek letters, but the rest of the sentence is in English (and he does precede it with &quot; the &quot; ). [ Appearances in the twentieth century ] The term has appeared in several films and radio programs. One of the earliest short films from the Three Stooges was a 1935 film titled Hoi Polloi. The film opens in an exclusive restaurant where two wealthy gentlemen are arguing whether heredity or environment is more important in shaping character. { New York Times Movies } They make a bet and pick on nearby trashmen (the Stooges) to prove their theory. At the conclusion of three months in training, the Stooges attend a dinner party, where they thoroughly embarrass the professors. The University of Dayton &apos;s Don Morlan says, &quot; The theme in these shorts of the Stooges against the rich is bringing the rich down to their level and shaking their heads. &quot; A typical Stooges joke from the film is when someone addresses them as &quot; gentlemen, &quot; and they look over their shoulders to see who was being addressed. { von Busack, Richard, Pure Slap Shtik } { Metro Santa Cruz - January 16–22, 1997. } The Three Stooges turn the tables on their hosts by calling them &quot; hoi polloi &quot; at the end. The term continues to be used in contemporary writing. In his 1983 introduction to Robert Anton Wilson &apos;s Prometheus Rising, Israel Regardie writes, &quot; Once I was even so presumptuous as to warn (Wilson) in a letter that his humor was much too good to waste on hoi polloi who generally speaking would not understand it and might even resent it. &quot; { Regardie, Israel Introduction } { Prometheus 1983. } The term &quot; hoi polloi &quot; was used in a dramatic scene in the 1989 film Dead Poets Society. In this scene, Professor Keating speaks negatively about the use of the article &quot; the &quot; in front of the phrase: Keating: This is battle, boys. War! Your souls are at a critical juncture. Either you will succumb to the hoi polloi and the fruit will die on the vine—or you will triumph as individuals.

A moment ago I used the term &apos;hoi polloi.&apos; Who knows what it means? Come on, Overstreet, you twirp. (laughter) Anderson, are you a man or a boil? Anderson shakes his head &quot; no &quot;, but Meeks raises his hands and speaks: &quot; The hoi polloi. Doesn&apos;t it mean the herd? &quot; Keating: Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say &quot; the hoi polloi &quot; you are actually saying &quot; the the herd. &quot; Indicating that you too are &quot; hoi polloi &quot;. Schulman, Tom Excerpts from the script of Dead Poets Society. Keating&apos;s tone makes clear that he considers this statement to be an insult. He used the phrase &quot; the hoi polloi, &quot; to demonstrate the mistake he warned against. The term also used in the 1980 comedy film Caddyshack. In a rare moment of cleverness, Spaulding Smails greets Danny Noonan as he arrives for the christening of The Flying Wasp, the boat belonging to Judge Elihu Smails (Spaulding&apos;s grandfather), with &quot; Ahoy, polloi! Where did you come from, a scotch ad? &quot; This is particularly ironic, because Danny has just finished mowing the Judge&apos;s lawn, and arrives overdressed, wearing a sailboat captain&apos;s outfit (as the girl seated next to him points out, Danny &quot; looks like Dick Cavett &quot; ). Todd Rundgren &apos;s band Utopia recorded a song titled &quot; Hoi Polloi &quot; on their 1980 album Deface the Music, in which all of the songs are written and performed in the style of The Beatles. The Lovin&apos; Spoonful &apos;s song Jug Band Music includes the line He tried to mooch a towel from the hoi polloi. In the song Risingson on Massive Attack &apos;s Mezzanine album, the singer apparently appeals to his company to leave the club they&apos;re in, deriding the common persons&apos; infatuation with them, and implying that he&apos;s about to slide into antisocial behaviour : Toy-like people make me boy-like (...)

In an episode of This American Life, radio host Ira Glass uses the term hoi polloi while relaying a story about a woman who believes the letter &apos;q&apos; should occur later in the alphabet. He goes on to say that &quot; Q does not belong in the middle of the alphabet where it is, with the hoi polloi of the alphabet, with your &apos;m&apos; &apos;n&apos; and &apos;p&apos;. Letters that will just join any word for the asking. &quot; The term was used in a first-series episode (The New Vicar, aired 5 November 1990) of the British sitcom Keeping Up Appearances. The main character, Hyacinth Bucket, gets into a telephone argument with a bakery employee. When the employee abruptly hangs up in frustration, Hyacinth disparagingly refers to him as &quot; hoi polloi. &quot; This is in keeping with her character; she looks down upon those she considers to be of lesser social standing, including working-class people. { Keeping Up Appearances 02 - Welcoming The Dishy Vicar Divxmoviesenglishsubtitles.com Accessed on 11 May 2007. } Hoi Polloi was used in Larry Marder &apos;s Tales of the Beanworld to name the unusual group of creatures that lived beneath the Beanworld.

[ Appearances in the twenty-first century ] The August 14, 2001 episode of CNN &apos;s Larry King Live program included a discussion about whether the sport of polo was an appropriate part of the image of the British Royal Family. Joining King on the program were &quot; best-selling biographer and veteran royal watcher Robert Lacey &quot; and Kitty Kelley, author of the book The Royals. Their discussions focused on Prince Charles and his son Prince William. Lacey said, &quot; There is another risk that I see in polo. Polo is a very nouveau riche, I think, rather vulgar game. I can say that having played it myself, and I don&apos;t think it does Prince Charles&apos;s image, or, I dare say, this is probably arrogant of me, his spirit any good. I don&apos;t think it is a good thing for him to be involved in. I also, I&apos;m afraid, don&apos;t think [polo] is a good thing for [Charles] to be encouraging his sons to get involved in. It is a very &quot; playboy &quot; set. We saw Harry recently all night clubbing, and why not, some might say, playing polo down in the south of Spain. I think the whole polo syndrome is something that the royal family would do very well to get uninvolved with as soon as possible. King turned the question to Kelley, saying, &quot; Kitty, it is kind of hoi polloi, although it is an incredible sport in which, I have been told, that the horse is 80 percent of the game, the rider 20 percent. But it is a great sport to watch. But it is hoi polloi isn&apos;t it? &quot; To which Kelley replied, &quot; Yes, I do agree with Robert. The time is come and gone for the royals to be involved with polo. I mean it is – it just increases that dissipated aristo-image that they have, and it is too bad to encourage someone like Prince William to get involved. &quot; Larry King Live The term also appears in the 2003 Broadway musical Wicked, where it is used by the characters Elphaba and Glinda to refer to the many inhabitants of the Emerald City : &quot;...

On 9 December 2004 he retracted his statement, saying &quot; And hoi-polloi refers to common people, not those rich morons that are evicting those two red-tail hawks (ph) from that fifth Avenue co-op. I misused the word hoi-polloi. And for that I humbly apologize. &quot; { American Morning Transcript } New media and new inventions have also been described as being by or for the hoi polloi. Bob Garfield, co-host of NPR &apos;s On the Media program, 8 November 2005, used the phrase in reference to changing practices in the media, especially Wikipedia, &quot; The people in the encyclopedia business, I understand, tend to sniff at the wiki process as being the product of the mere hoi polloi. &quot; { On the Media } The blog Isengard.gov referred to the $100 PC project as being for kids and the hoi polloi.
