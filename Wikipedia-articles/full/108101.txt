Public health advocates consider the ordinance to be a new front in a national battle against tobacco; officials from the American Lung Association of California said &quot; Belmont broke through this invisible barrier in the sense that it addressed drifting smoke in housing as a public health issue. &quot; { McKinley, Jesse. &quot; Smoking Ban Hits Home.
