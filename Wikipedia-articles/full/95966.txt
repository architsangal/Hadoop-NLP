[ History Section, 1879 History of Muscatine County Iowa http://iagenweb.org/muscatine/biographies1879/thename.htm 11 May 2009 ] The island lies opposite Muscatine County and was believed to be named after the Mascouten native American tribe, Algonquian-speaking Native Americans who lived in the area before being driven west by settler encroachment and other tribes. In 1833, Colonel George Davenport of Illinois sent three representatives into the territory to establish a trade post. They were the first European Americans to settle there. In the same year, James W. Casey and John Vanatta came to the area. They opened a supply depot for steamboats on June 1, 1833, and named it Casey’s Woodpile. (The steamboats burned wood.) The first public land sale was held in November 1838. One year later, the construction of the courthouse and a jail was begun. A second jail, referred to as the &quot; Old Jail &quot;, was built in 1857.
