In an interview with Joel Achenbach of the Washington Post, Druyan stated that her early interest in science stemmed from a fascination with Karl Marx. Achenbach commented that &quot; She had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence, &quot; a reference to her belief in the ancient astronauts of Erich von Däniken and the theories of Immanuel Velikovsky pertaining to the solar system. { Achenbach, Joel (1999). Captured by Aliens: the search for life and truth in a very large universe. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. ISBN 0-684-84856-2. pp. 95-6: &quot; Her interest in science came primarily from her interest in the philosophy of Karl Marx.... Druyan herself had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence for her many sundry beliefs (as she later acknowledged). She believed... that Immanuel Velikovsky in the 1950s had correctly deduced the truth about the solar system.... She believed in the ancient astronauts of Erich von Daniken. &quot; } Druyan freely acknowledged her past views but also asserted that they changed dramatically after marrying Carl Sagan. [ Notable quotations ] [ yes ] [ &quot; It is a great tragedy that science, this wonderful process for finding out what is true, has ceded the spiritual uplift of its central revelations: the vastness of the universe, the immensity of time, the relatedness of all life, and life’s preciousness on our tiny planet. &quot; Ann Druyan interviewed by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry Ann Druyan Talks About Science, Religion, Wonder, Awe... and Carl Sagan, Skeptical Inquirer, Volume 27.6, November/December 2003. ] [ November 2011 ] [ &quot; When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don&apos;t ever expect to be reunited with Carl. &quot; Ann Druyan in the Notable Names Database Ann Druyan, Notable Names Database (NNDB). Retrieved: 2011-11-05. ] [ &quot; I think the roots of this antagonism to science run very deep. They&apos;re ancient. We see them in Genesis, this first story, this founding myth of ours, in which the first humans are doomed and cursed eternally for asking a question, for partaking of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. It&apos;s puzzling that Eden is synonymous with paradise when, if you think about it at all, it&apos;s more like a maximum-security prison with twenty-four hour surveillance. It&apos;s a horrible place. Adam and Eve have no childhood. They awaken full-grown. What is a human being without a childhood? Our long childhood is a critical feature of our species. It differentiates us, to a degree, from most other species. We take a longer time to mature. We depend upon these formative years and the social fabric to learn many of the things we need to know. &quot; Ann Druyan interviewed by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry ] [ Awards ] 2004 Richard Dawkins Award [ References ] [ External links ] [ September 2010 ] &quot; Carl Sagan And Ann Druyan&apos;s Ultimate Mix Tape &quot; NPR interview with Ann Druyan February 12, 2010 A Speech given by Ann Druyan at the 1997 annual convention of the Freedom From Religion Foundation A TV news report on Ann Druyan&apos;s comments at the dedication of SETI&apos;s Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe, October 17, 2006.
