The population was 3,713 at the 2000 census and was estimated at 3,735 as of 2008. It is one of two Steamship Authority ferry ports on the island, although the Oak Bluffs steamships only operates in the summer. [ History ] Oak Bluffs was first settled in 1642 and was officially incorporated in 1880 as Cottage City. Before its incorporation, it was part of Edgartown. The town re-incorporated in 1907 as Oak Bluffs, named because the town was the site of an oak grove along the bluffs. Oak Bluffs originally began as the center for tourism on the Vineyard. While the other towns were more focused on industry, Oak Bluffs became a mecca for travelers from around the world as early as the beginning of the 1800s. It also became a center of the thriving 19th century Methodist movement. In the area known now as the Martha&apos;s Vineyard Campground Meeting Association ( MVCMA ) or “The Campground“, members of the Methodist church would come each summer to pitch tents and have open air meetings. As these meetings became more and more popular, returning visitors began replacing the tents with small wooden buildings generally known now as Gingerbread Cottages. This name originated from the ornate molding and bright colors that these summer homes were painted and because of their quaint, almost storybook look. With the Methodist camp meetings taking place in the center, the campground expanded in a circular pattern around the meeting area until hundreds of the small cottages sprang up. Later a more permanent structure was built, called the Tabernacle. This covered open sided structure allowed speakers and meeting attendees to weather the elements and gave rise to a community center which is still in use today. The campground Gingerbread cottages are cherished historic landmarks as well as very expensive real estate. Many are still family owned and passed on generation to generation. In 1873 the neighboring community of Harthaven was established by William H. Hart when he purchased a lot from the Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company. The community later moved in 1911 to its present location between Oak Bluffs town and Edgartown. In 1884, the Flying Horses Carousel was brought to Oak Bluffs, where it remains the oldest platform carousel still in operation. It was originally on Coney Island, but was moved to Oak Bluffs in 1884. It was built in 1876. It&apos;s a yearly event to what residents call “The Grand Illumination ”. This traditional celebration is held once a year, usually in August, the date of which is not always publicly disclosed. For the 2012 summer events, there is an open Cottage Tour, of the National Historical Registered homes, on Wednesday, August 8, and Grand Illumination Night on Wednesday, August 15. { http://www.mvcma.org/events.htm } Martha&apos;s Vineyard, Oak Bluffs and the Campground events attract many tourists. For one special night, residents of the Campground place ornate Chinese lanterns (some electric, some still lit with just a candle), around each Gingerbread Cottage. The lanterns remain dark until after dusk. At an appointed hour, people gather in the Tabernacle for a sing-along and community gathering. At the end all the lights go out and thousands of Chinese lanterns spring to life in a brilliant cascade of light throughout the campground. The celebration ends after visitors walk through the Campground enjoying the sights and sounds of an event taken straight from the turn of the century and brought to life yearly in the small town of Oak Bluffs. On April 5, 2005, the grounds and buildings in the Campground were designated a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior. On November 16, 2006, MTV announced that they were going to make a new TV show called &quot; The Bluffs, &quot; about African-Americans going to Oak Bluffs for the summer, but these plans never materialized after vocal public criticism in Island newspapers. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 26.0 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 7.4 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and [ 18.6 sqmi km2 ] of it (71.61%) is water. The town is 323rd out of 351 communities in the Commonwealth in terms of land area, and is the third smallest community (behind Aquinnah and Tisbury ) in Dukes County. Oak Bluffs is bordered by Nantucket Sound to the north and east, Edgartown to the south, and Vineyard Harbor, Lagoon Pond and Tisbury to the west. It also shares a common corner, along with Tisbury and Edgartown, with West Tisbury. From the northernmost tip of the town, at East Chop Light, the town is just over five miles from the mainland. The town shares Sengekontacket Pond with Edgartown, with the town&apos;s land ending and Sarson&apos;s Island, but wrapping around the waters around Felix Neck into Major&apos;s Cove. There are four beaches in the town, at Eastville Point (along the lagoon road), the town beach just south of Oak Bluffs Harbor, Harthaven beach and Joseph Sylvia State Beach along the shore opposite Sengekontacket Pond. The highest points in town are between the pond and the lagoon, and west of the lagoon in the irregular triangle of land which juts into Tisbury. Oak Bluffs is the site of Trade Winds Airport, a private landing strip located just north of the pond, as well as a steamship authority pier for the ferries from Woods Hole, Falmouth Harbor, New Bedford and Hyannis Port. Only the Woods Hole ferry, however, is year round; the others are seasonal only.
