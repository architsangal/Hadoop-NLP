Thompson in 1878, a series of acquisitions changed the College&apos;s name and location multiple times. It was renamed Burlington Business College in 1884, moved to Bank Street in 1905, and relocated to Main Street in 1910. In 1958, the College took its current name and moved to Hill Section of Burlington, where it remains today. That year, it offered associate&apos;s degree programs and enrolled about 60 students. Champlain College grew over the decades, opening its first dormitories in 1965, starting new programs in the field of social services in the 1970s, and adding the Hauke Family Campus Center in 1989. The first bachelor&apos;s degree programs were offered in 1991, and online education began in 1993. The College&apos;s library, the Robert E. and Holly D. Miller Information Commons, was opened in 1998. In 2002, the College initiated its first master&apos;s degree program. The S.D. Ireland Family Center for Global Business &amp; Technology, a new academic facility, opened in 2004, and the IDX Student Life Center was dedicated the following year. Also in 2005, Dr. David F. Finney was inaugurated as the Champlain&apos;s seventh president, and the College added a second master&apos;s degree to its offerings. A program to encourage student entrepreneurs, called BYOBiz, was launched in 2006. The next year, the College opened a study-abroad campus in Montreal. In 2008, two new student residences, Lakeview Hall and Adirondack House, opened in Burlington, and a second study-abroad campus opened in Dublin.

LEAD aims to build knowledge in four areas: understanding personality styles, building inclusive community, lifelong career management, and financial sophistication. This knowledge is intended to enable students to adapt to changing environments, make good decisions in difficult situations, and pursue short and long-term goals successfully. { http://www.champlain.edu/LEAD-Program.html } LEAD requirements are completed outside of class in groups led by student Peer Advisers. The groups are established based on where they live on campus (commuters are in a group of their own). Completion of the LEAD activities is required in order for students to register for their classes the next semester. One part of the Core is the Global Module. The Global Module is a discussion forum where students from Champlain College communicate with students from other countries around the world. The module features a guided discussion that focuses on important issues and gives students a perspective from outside the country. The Global Module is required for all students in the Core program.
