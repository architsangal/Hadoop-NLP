Founded on 2 August 1940, it currently plays in Segunda División B, holding home matches at Estadio Carlos Belmonte, with a 17,300-seat capacity. [ History ] The club was founded in 1940, under the name Albacete Fútbol Asociación, being later changed in an attempt to make it sound &quot; more Spanish &quot;. After years playing in the lower leagues, Albacete first played in the second division in 1985–86, repeating the feat five seasons later. In 1989, Benito Floro consecutively promoted it from the third to La Liga, overachieving for a seventh place in the first season in the top level. Floro would later coach Real Madrid, returning to Alba two seasons later, as the club were relegated in 1995–96. After years in the second division facing serious economic and sporting difficulties, Albacete returned to the top flight in the 2002–03 campaign, led by César Ferrando (later of Atlético de Madrid ). However, it dropped in 2004–05, after just six wins from 38 matches, going on to stabilize in the subsequent seasons in the second level. Estadio Carlos Belmonte The 2010–11 season brought two coaching changes, with both Antonio Calderón and David Vidal (who returned to the club only a few months after leaving) being fired, as Albacete returned to the third division after 21 years. On 6 December 2011, Andrés Iniesta - who played for the club in his youth before joining FC Barcelona - became the club&apos;s major shareholder, injecting € 420,000 into the cash-trapped institution. { Iniesta throws 420,000-euro lifeline to indebted Albacete; } { El País, 6 December 2011 } The team managed to reach the last-16 in Copa del Rey nonetheless, notably beating Atlético Madrid 3–1 on aggregate. { Manzano sacked by Atletico; } { ESPN Star Sports, 23 December 2011 } [ Seasons ] [ Season to season ] Season Division Place Copa del Rey 1940/41 Regional 1941/42 Regional 1942/43 Regional 1943/44 3ª 2nd 1944/45 3ª 3rd 1945/46 3ª 1st 1946/47 3ª 1st 1947/48 3ª 3rd 1948/49 3ª 1st 1949/50 2ª 7th 1950/51 2ª 15th 1951/52 Regional — 1952/53 3ª 3rd 1953/54 3ª 13th 1954/55 3ª 7th 1955/56 3ª 9th 1956/57 3ª 5th 1957/58 3ª 5th 1958/59 3ª 1st 1959/60 3ª 4th 1960/61 3ª 1st 1961/62 2ª 13th Season Division Place Copa del Rey 1962/63 3ª 4th 1963/64 3ª 1st 1964/65 3ª 1st 1965/66 3ª 3rd 1966/67 3ª 2nd 1967/68 3ª 4th 1968/69 3ª 8th 1969/70 3ª 14th 1970–71 Regional — 1971–72 Regional — 1972–73 Regional — 1973–74 Regional — 1974–75 Regional — 1975/76 3ª 17th 1976/77 Regional — 1977/78 3ª 2nd 1978/79 3ª 2nd 1979/80 3ª 2nd 1980/81 3ª 2nd 1981/82 3ª 1st 1982/83 2ªB 3rd 1983/84 2ªB 5th Season Division Place Copa del Rey 1984/85 2ªB 2nd 1985/86 2ª 17th 1986/87 2ªB 17th 1987/88 2ªB 3rd 1988/89 2ªB 12th 1989/90 2ªB 1st 1990/91 2ª 1st 1991/92 1ª 7th 1992/93 1ª 17th 1993/94 1ª 13th 1994/95 1ª 17th 1995/96 1ª 20th 1996/97 2ª 4th 1997/98 2ª 14th 1998/99 2ª 15th 1999/00 2ª 10th Season Division Place Copa del Rey 2000/01 2ª 5th 2001/02 2ª 10th 2002/03 2ª 3rd 2003/04 1ª 14th 2004/05 1ª 20th 2005/06 2ª 13th 2006/07 2ª 6th 2007/08 2ª 12th 2008/09 2ª 15th 2009/10 2ª 15th 2010/11 2ª 22nd Second Round 2011/12 2ªB 4th 7 seasons in La Liga 18 seasons in Segunda División 8 seasons in Segunda División B 29 seasons in Tercera División 7 seasons in Categorías Regionales [ Recent seasons ] Season Pos.
