[ Fox-Davies 2008 607 ] {. } [ History ] [ Origins ] [ English heraldry Armorial of Plantagenet ] { Richard the Lionheart &apos;s second } { Great Seal was the first Royal emblem of England to feature three lions } Lions had previously been used by the Norman dynasty as royal emblems, and arms have been attributed to kings who pre-dated the systematization of hereditary English heraldry that occurred in the second half of the 12th century. King Henry II is thought to have used a coat with two lions on it. [ Ailes Adrian The Origins of The Royal Arms of England 1982 Graduate Center for Medieval Studies, University of Reading Reading 52–63 ] His children experimented with different combinations of lions. Richard the Lionheart used a single lion rampant, or perhaps two lions affrontés, on his first seal, but later used three lions passant in his 1198 Great Seal of England, and thus established the lasting design of the Royal Arms of England. Although King John had a seal in 1177 with two lions passant guardant, the three golden lions passant on a red shield were used as the Royal Arms (or King&apos;s Arms) by John, Henry III, Edward I, and Edward II. In 1362, Edward III, Lord of Aquitaine, who used his lion of Aquitaine as his crest, made his eldest son Edward Prince of Aquitaine. In 1390, this Edward&apos;s son King Richard II appointed his uncle John of Gaunt as Duke of Aquitaine. This title again passed on to Henry IV (1399), who inherited the duchy from his father, but ceded it to his son upon becoming King of England. Henry V continued to rule over Aquitaine as King of England and Lord of Aquitaine. The Lion of Aquitaine remained as the Royal Crest of England ever since Edward III. [ Development ] [ English claims to the French throne Union of the Crowns ] In 1340, following the death of King Charles IV of France, Edward III asserted a claim to the French throne through his mother Isabella of France. In addition to initiating the Hundred Years&apos; War, Edward III expressed his claim in heraldic form by quartering the royal arms of England with the Arms of France. This quartering continued until 1801, with intervals in 1360–1369 and 1420–1422. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1603, the throne of England was inherited by the Scottish House of Stuart, resulting in the Union of the Crowns : the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under King James I of England and VI of Scotland. [ Ross 2002 56 1603:James VI becomes James I of England in the Union of the Crowns, and leaves Edinburgh for London ] {. } As a consequence, the Royal Arms of England and Scotland were combined in the king&apos;s new personal arms. Nevertheless, although referencing the personal union with Scotland and Ireland, the Royal Arms of England remained distinct from the Royal Arms of Scotland, until the two realms were joined in a political union in 1707, leading to a unified Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. Escutcheon Period Description center 1154–1189 King Henry II, the first king from the House of Plantagenet, is thought to have used pair of lions passant in his personal arms.

The claim to the French throne continued, albeit passively, until it was mooted by the French Revolution and the formation of the French First Republic in 1792. During the peace negotiations at the Conference of Lille, from July to November 1797, the French delegates demanded that the King of Great Britain abandon the title of King of France as a condition of peace. The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Under King George III of the United Kingdom, a proclamation of 1 January 1801 set the royal style and titles and modified the Royal Arms, removing the French quarter and putting the arms of England, Scotland and Ireland on the same structural level, with the dynastic arms of Hanover moved to an inescutcheon. [ Contemporary ] [ National symbols of England ] English heraldry flourished as a working art up to around the 17th century, when it assumed a mainly ceremonial role. The Royal Arms of England continued to embody information relating to English history. Although the Acts of Union 1707 placed England within the Kingdom of Great Britain, prompting new, British Royal Arms, the Royal Arms of England has continued to endure as one of the national symbols of England, and has a variety of active uses. For instance, the coats of arms of both The Football Association [ http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamHist/HistThreeLions.html England Football Online – The Three Lions englandfootballonline.com 2010-09-15 ] and the England and Wales Cricket Board { England Wales Cricket Board } have a design featuring three lions passant, based on the historic Royal Arms of England. In 1997 (and again in 2002), the Royal Mint issued a British one pound (£1) coin featuring three lions passant to represent England. To celebrate St George&apos;s Day, in 2001, Royal Mail issued first– and second-class postage stamps with the Royal Crest of England (a crowned lion), and the Royal Arms of England (three lions passant) respectively.

[ Crest, supporters and other parts of the achievement ] Various accessories to the escutcheon (shield) were added and modified by successive English monarchs. These included a crest (with mantling, helm and crown ); supporters (with a compartment ); a motto; and the insignia of an order of knighthood. These various components made up the full achievement of arms. [ Royal crest ] { ermine. The steel helm has gold embellishments. } The first addition to the shield was in the form of a crest borne above the shield. It was during the reign of Edward III that the crest began to be widely used in English heraldry. The first representation of a royal crest was in Edward&apos;s third Great Seal, which showed a helm above the arms, and thereon a gold lion passant guardant standing upon a chapeau, and bearing a royal crown on its head. [ Brooke-Little 1981 4–8 ] {. } The design underwent minor variations until it took on its present form in the reign of Henry VIII : &quot; The Royal Crown proper, thereon a lion statant guardant Or, royally crowned also proper &quot;. The exact form of crown used in the crest varied over time. Until the reign of Henry VI it was usually shown as an open circlet adorned with fleurs-de-lys or stylised leaves. On Henry&apos;s first seal for foreign affairs the design was altered with the circlet decorated by alternating crosses formy and fleurs-de-lys. From the reign of Edward IV the crown bore a single arch, altered to a double arch by Henry VII. The design varied in details until the late 17th century, but since that time has consisted of a jewelled circlet, above which are alternating crosses formy and fleurs-de-lys. From this spring two arches decorated with pearls, and at their intersection an orb surmounted by a cross formy. A cap of crimson velvet is shown within the crown, with the cap&apos;s ermine lining appearing at the base of the crown in lieu of a torse. The shape of the arches of the crown has been represented differently at different times, and can help to date a depiction of the crest. The helm on which the crest was borne was originally a simple steel design, sometimes with gold embellishments. In the reign of Elizabeth I a pattern of helm unique to the Royal Arms was introduced. This is a gold helm with a barred visor, facing the viewer. [ Brooke-Little 1981 16 ] {. } The decorative mantling (a stylised cloth cloak that hangs from the helm) was originally of red cloth lined with ermine, but was altered to cloth of gold lined ermine by Elizabeth.

His white boar badge prompted the scornful epithet &quot; The Hog &quot;. } Animal supporters, standing on either side of the shield to hold and guard it, first appeared in English heraldry in the 15th century. Originally, they were not regarded as an integral part of arms, and were subject to frequent change. Various animals were sporadically shown supporting the Royal Arms of England, but it was only with the reign of Edward IV that their use became consistent. Supporters fell under the regulation of the Kings of Arms in the Tudor period. The heralds of that time also prochronistically created supporters for earlier monarchs, and although these attributed supporters were never used by the monarchs concerned, they were later used to signify them on public buildings or monuments completed after their deaths, for instance at St. George&apos;s Chapel, in Windsor Castle.

Since then, the full achievement of the Royal Arms has included a representation of the Garter, encircling the shield. This is a blue circlet with gold buckle and edging, bearing the order&apos;s Old French motto Honi soit qui mal y pense ( &quot; evil to him who evil thinks &quot; ) in gold capital letters. A motto, placed on a scroll below the Royal Arms of England, seems to have first been adopted by Henry IV in the early 15th century. His motto was Souverayne ( &quot; sovereign &quot; ). His son, Henry V adopted the motto Dieu et mon droit ( &quot; God and my right &quot; ). While this motto has been exclusively used since the accession of George I in 1714, and continues to form part of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom, other mottoes were used by certain monarchs in the intervening period. Veritas temporis filia ( &quot; truth is the daughter of time &quot; ) was the motto of Mary I (1553–1558), Semper Eadem ( &quot; always the same &quot; ) was used by Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and Anne (1702–1714), James I (1603–1625) sometimes used Beati pacifici ( &quot; blessed are the peacemakers &quot; ), while William III (1689–1702) used the motto of the House of Orange : Je maintiendrai ( &quot; I will maintain &quot; ).
