The border created a buffer zone and was drawn through the Pashtun areas of settlement leaving the larger part of them in what was to become Pakistan. Pashto (since 1936) is one of the two official language s of Afghanistan, along with Dari (Persian). { Modarresi, Yahya: &apos;&apos;Iran, Afghanistan and Tadjikistan &quot;. 1911 - 1916.

ISBN 3-11-018418-4 } Since the early 18th century, all the kings of Afghanistan were ethnic Pashtuns except for Habibullah Kalakani, and most of them bilingual although Amānullāh Khān spoke Pashto as his second language. Persian as the literary language of the royal court { Lorenz, Manfred. Die Herausbildung moderner iranischer Literatursprachen. In: Zeitschrift für Phonetik, Sprachwissenschaft und Kommunikationsforschung, Vol. 36. Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR. Akademie Verlag, Berlin: 1983. P. 184ff. } was more widely used in government institutions while Pashto was spoken by the Pashtun tribes as their native tongue. Amanullah Khan began promoting Pashto during his reign as a marker of ethnic identity and a symbol of &quot; official nationalism &quot; leading Afghanistan to independence after the defeat of the British colonial power in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. In the 1930s, a movement began to take hold to promote Pashto as a language of government, administration and art with the establishment of a Pashto Society Pashto Anjuman in 1931 { Other sources note 1933, i.e. Johannes Christian Meyer-Ingwersen. Untersuchungen zum Satzbau des Paschto. 1966. Ph.D. Thesis, Hamburg 1966. } and the inauguration of the Kabul University in 1932 as well as the formation of the Pashto Academy Pashto Tolana in 1937. Although officially strengthening the use of Pashto, the Afghan elite regarded Persian as a &quot; sophisticated language and a symbol of cultured upbringing &quot;. { Tariq Rahman. Pashto Language &amp; Identity Formation in Pakistan. Contemporary South Asia, July 1995, Vol 4, Issue 2, p151-20. } King Zahir Shah thus followed suit after his father Nadir Khan had decreed in 1933, that both Persian and Pashto were to be studied and utilized by officials. { István Fodor, Claude Hagège. Reform of Languages. Buske, 1983. P. 105ff. } In 1936, Pashto was formally granted the status of an official language { Campbell, George L.: Concise compendium of the world&apos;s languages. London: Routledge 1999. } with full rights to usage in all aspects of government and education by a royal decree under Zahir Shah despite the fact that the ethnically Pashtun royal family and bureaucrates mostly spoke Persian. { Hussain, Rizwan. Pakistan and the emergence of Islamic militancy in Afghanistan. Burlington, Ashgate: 2005. p. 63. } Thus Pashto became a national language, a symbol for Afghan nationalism.

Pashto is the regional language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and northern Balochistan. { Septfonds, D. 2006. Pashto. In: Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world. 845 - 848. Keith Brown / Sarah Ogilvie (eds.). Elsevier, Oxford: 2009. } In 1984, Pashto was permitted to be used as the medium of instruction in primary schools. In government-controlled primary schools in Pashto-speaking areas, Pashto is now the medium of instruction in class 1 and 2, and taught as a compulsory subject up to class 5, but the English medium private schools don&apos;t include Pashto at all in their curricula.

[ The World&apos;s Major Languages Comrie Bernard 1990 Oxford University Press 549 ] Nonetheless, the Pashtuns are sometimes compared with the Pakhta tribes mentioned in the Rigveda (1700–1100 BC), apparently the same as a people called Pactyans, described by the Greek historian Herodotus as living in the Achaemenid &apos;s Arachosia Satrap y as early as the 1st millennium BC. [ http://www.piney.com/Heredotus7.html The History of Herodotus Chapter 7 Translated by George Rawlinson The History Files 440  BC 2007-01-10 ] However, this comparison appears to be due mainly to the apparent, etymologically unjustified, similarity between their names.

However, this is disputed by several European experts due to lack of strong evidence. Pata Khazana is a Pashto manuscript [ http://patakhazana.home.comcast.net/~patakhazana/Khazana.pdf Pata Khazana pdf 2010-09-27 ] claimed to be first compiled during the Hotaki dynasty (1709–1738) in Kandahar, Afghanistan. During the 17th century Pashto poetry was becoming very popular among the Pashtuns. Some of those who wrote poetry in Pashto are Khushal Khan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Nazo Tokhi and Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the modern state of Afghanistan or the Afghan Empire. [ Grammar ] [ Pashto grammar ] Pashto is a subject–object–verb (SOV) language with split ergativity. Adjective s come before noun s. Nouns and adjectives are inflected for two gender s (masc./fem.), { Emeneau, M. B. (1962) &quot; Bilingualism and Structural Borrowing &quot; Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 106(5): pp. 430-442, p. 441 } two number s (sing./plur.), and four cases (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). The verb system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect and past perfect. There is also an inflection for the subjunctive mood. The sentence construction of Pashto is akin to Indo-Aryan languages like Prakrits and Hindi-Urdu, unlike Persian. The Pashto noun comes after the adjective and the possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object, { [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445534/Pashto-language Encyclopædia Britannica } therefore Pashto shows a partly ergative behavior. Pashto uses both preposition and postposition, but also circumpositions. [ Phonology ] [ Vowels ] [ i ] [ u ] [ e ] [ ə ] [ o ] [ a ] [ ɑ ] Front Central Back Close Mid Open Pashto also has the diphthongs [ /ai/, /əi/, /ɑw/, /aw/ ].

The retroflex lateral flap [ // ] ( [ /ɺ̢/ ] ) is pronounced as retroflex approximant [ [ɻ] ] when final. The retroflex fricatives [ /ʂ/, /ʐ/ ] and palatal fricative s [ /ç/, /ʝ/ ] represent dialectally different pronunciations of the same sound, not separate phonemes. In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of Kandahar ), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the postalveolar fricatives [ /ʃ/, /ʒ/ ], while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the velar phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as [ /x/, /ɡ/ ] (not [ /ɣ/ ] ). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983), { Michael M.T. Henderson, &apos;&apos;Four Varieties of Pashto&apos;&apos; } the west-central voiced palatal fricative [ /ʝ/ ] actually occurs only in the Wardak Province, and is merged into [ /ɡ/ ] elsewhere in the region. The velar s [ /k/, /ɡ/, /x/, /ɣ/ ] followed by the close back rounded vowel [ /u/ ] assimilate into the labialized velars [ [kʷ], [ɡʷ], [xʷ], [ɣʷ] ]. [ Vocabulary ] In Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other Eastern Iranian languages; those words can be easily compared to those known from Avestan, Ossetic and Pamir languages. However, a remarkably large number of words are special to Pashto. [ http://www.iranica.com/articles/afghanistan-vi-pasto AFGHANISTAN vi. Paṧto Encyclopaedia Iranica Online Version G.

The reason for this is because, it is not a Semitic language, and thus it is modified. It has extra letters for Pashto-specific sounds. Since the 17th century Pashto has been primarily written in the Naskh script, rather than the Nasta&apos;liq script used for neighboring Persian and Urdu languages. The Pashto alphabet consists of 45 letters, and 4 diacritic marks.

Pashto alifba (pdf) } [ Dialects ] [ Pashto dialects ] Pashto has two main dialects: a softer dialect spoken in the south, and a harsher dialect in the north. The former is further divided into southwestern and southeastern dialects, and the latter into northwestern (also called central or Ghiljai dialect) and northeastern. It is dominated by the geographical spread of the shift in the pronunciation of these five consonants: [ [ʂ] ] [ [ʐ] ] [ [ts] ] [ [dz] ] [ [ʒ] ] [ [ʃ] ] [ [ʒ] ] [ [ts] ] [ [dz] ] [ [ʒ] ] [ [ç] ] [ [g]/[ʝ] ] [ [ts] ] [ [z] ] [ [ʒ] ] [ [x] ] [ [ɡ] ] [ [s] ] [ [z] ] [ [dʒ] ] Southwest Southeast Central Northeast The morphological differences between the most extreme north-eastern and south-western dialects are comparatively few and unimportant, and the criteria of dialect differentiation in Pashto are primarily phonological. { D. N. MacKenzie, &quot; A Standard Pashto &quot;, Khyber.org } [ Development of Pashto ] Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1689) wrote in Pashto. His poetry consists of more than 45,000 poems. According to some historians [ May 2012 ], the number of books written by Khattak are more than 200. His more famous books are Bāz Nāma, Fazal Nāma, Distār Nāma and Farrah Nāma. From the time of Ahmad Shah Baba (1723-1773) Pashto has been the language of the court. Its first teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah by Pir Mohammad Kakerr with the title of Ma&apos;refa al-Afghāni ( &quot; Introduction of Afghani &quot; ). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto verbs was written in 1805 A.D. in India under the title of Riāz al-Muhabat ( &quot; Training in Affection &quot; ) through the patronage of Nawab Mohabat Khan son of Hafez Rahmatullah Khan, the famous chief of the Barreitsh. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafez Rahmat Khan in 1808 A.D. wrote a book of Pashto words entitled Ajāyeb-al-Lughat ( &quot; Strangeness of Words &quot; ).
