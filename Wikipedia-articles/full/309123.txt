Saberhagen served as an enlisted man in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War while he was in his early twenties. [ Fred Saberhagen (obituary) The Independent 6 September 2007 ] Back in civilian life, Saberhagen worked as an electronics technician for the Motorola Corporation from 1958 to 1962, when he was around 30 years old. It was while he was working for Motorola that Saberhagen started writing fiction seriously at the age of about 30. [ http://www.crescentblues.com/4_1issue/saberhagen.shtml Fred Saberhagen: Pushing Humanity&apos;s Envelope (interview) October 21, 2009 ] His first sale was to Galaxy Magazine, which published his short story &quot; Volume PAA-PYX &quot; in 1961. [ Obituary: Fred Saberhagen Michael Carlson The Guardian 20 July 2007 http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2007/jul/20/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries ] &quot; Fortress Ship &quot;, his first &quot; Berserker &quot; short shory, was published in 1963. Then, in 1964, Saberhagen saw the publication of his first novel, The Golden People. From 1967 to 1973, he worked as an editor for the Chemistry articles in the Encyclopædia Britannica as well as writing its article on science fiction. He then quit and took up writing full time. In 1975, he moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico. He married fellow writer Joan Spicci in 1968. They had two sons and a daughter. On June 29, 2007, Saberhagen died of prostate cancer in Albuquerque. [ Published works ] [ Dracula sequence ] Saberhagen&apos;s Dracula novels are based on the premise that vampires are morally equal to normal humans: they have the power to do good or evil, it is their choice. The first in the series, The Dracula Tape, is the story of Bram Stoker &apos;s Dracula told from Dracula &apos;s point of view. (Saberhagen depicts Dracula as the historical figure Vlad Ţepeş, who as woiwode of Wallachia was known as Drakulya, who in Saberhagen&apos;s stories became a vampire by simply refusing to die, &quot; by a transcendent act of will &quot; as the character describes it in the book.) As the continuation of the series makes obvious, in this version, Dracula survives the best efforts of Harker, Van Helsing and company, who are portrayed largely as bungling fools, Van Helsing in particular as a fraud and heretic. Dracula was violent and mean-tempered but nonetheless is bound by his own sense of honor and is loyal to his loved ones. Dracula, in his mortal life, fought the encroach of the Ottoman Turkish Empire into Europe. ( &quot; There is not an ounce of soil here which has not been enriched by the blood of patriots. &quot; ) In later novels, Dracula interacts with other literary characters including Sherlock Holmes. This series was often listed in Ace promotional materials as &quot; The New Dracula &quot;. His success with this series was such that he was hired to write the novelization of the 1992 movie Bram Stoker&apos;s Dracula.

Saberhagen&apos;s Berserkers are self-replicating war machines programmed with one main objective: Destroy all life. After destroying both their creators and the opposing side in a long-ago galactic war, the self-replicating Berserkers have continued to wipe out all forms of life that they encounter in the Milky Way, which leads to the cooperation and coordination of most of the sentient races in major attempts to defeat them. Humankind, although relatively new to the galactic scene, is a major player because of its aggressive nature. The series spans a large range of both time and space, and so has less plot continuity than Saberhagen&apos;s other series. &quot; Stone Man, &quot; (na) Worlds of Tomorrow May 1967 &quot; The Winged Helmet, &quot; (na) If Aug. 1967 &quot; Brother Berserker, &quot; (na) If Nov. 1967 { Berserker&apos;s Planet, (n) If May/June 1974 (+1) / (DAW April 1975) / (Ace May 1980) } { Berserker Man, (Ace April 1979) } { The Ultimate Enemy, (Ace Sep. 1979) (short fiction collection) } The Berserker Wars, (Tor Dec. 1981) (short fiction collection; only 2 original/uncollected stories); ( available online ) as a Baen Free Sample from Berserker Death omnibus { Berserker Base, (Tor March 1985); Mosaic Berserker novel with several guest authors contributing original stories; Saberhagen wrote the overarching story in segments between them, using the Niven story as the novel&apos;s fulcrum point: } &quot; What Makes Us Human, &quot; Stephen R.
