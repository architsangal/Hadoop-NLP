{ Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag hypothetical boundary to the west; one of the visions of the borders of Greater Serbia held by its advocates (e.g. } { Vojislav Šešelj ). } The term Greater Serbia or Great Serbia ( [ Велика Србија ], Velika Srbija) applies to the Serbian nationalist and irredentist ideology directed towards the creation of a Serbia n land which would incorporate all regions of traditional significance to the Serbian nation, and regions outside of Serbia that are populated mostly by Serbs. This movement&apos;s main ideology is to unite all Serbs (or all historically ruled or Serb populated lands ) into one state, claiming, depending on the version, different areas of many surrounding countries. The Greater Serbian ideology including claims to territories of modern day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia. In some historical forms, Greater Serbian aspirations also included territories of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Its inspiration comes from the memory and existence of the relatively large and powerful Serbian Empire that existed in 14th century south-eastern Europe prior to the Ottoman invasion. [ Historical perspective ] Following the growing nationalistic tendency in Europe from the 18th century onwards, such as the Unification of Italy, Serbia - after first gaining its principality within the Ottoman Empire in 1817 - experienced a popular desire for full unification with the Serbs of the remaining territories, mainly those living in neighbouring entities. [ May 2012 ] { Principality of Serbia mid-19th century. } The idea of territorial expansion of Serbia originally formulated 1844 in Načertanije, a secret political program of the Principality of Serbia, according to which the new Serbian state could include the neighboring areas of Montenegro, Northern Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina. [ http://www.rastko.org.rs/istorija/batakovic/batakovic-nacertanije_eng.html Ilija Garasanin&apos;s &quot; Nacertanije &quot; : A Reasessment Rastko.org.rs 2010-08-04 ] In the early 20th century, all political parties of the Kingdom of Serbia (except for the Social Democratic Party ) planning to create a Balkan Federation, generally accepted the idea of uniting all Serbs into one only Serbian state. [ The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics Banac Ivo Ivo Banac 1988 Cornell University Press 110 0-8014-9493-1 ] From the creation of the Principality until the First World War, the territory of Serbia was constantly expanding. [ Heavenly Serbia: From Myth to Genocide Anzulovic Branimir 1999 New York University Press 89 0-8147-0671-1 ] { Miloš Milojević &apos;s nineteenth-century Greater Serbia map where there is a clear assumption all other South-Slavs are Serbs. } After the end of the Balkan Wars, the Kingdom of Serbia achieved the expansion towards the south, but there was a mixed reaction to the events, for the reason that the promises of lands gaining access to the Adriatic Sea were not fulfilled. Instead, Serbia received the territories of Vardar Macedonia that was intended to become part of the Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Serbian Army had to leave those coastal territories that would become part of the newly formed Kingdom of Albania. This event, together with the Austro-Hungarian Annexation of Bosnia, frustrated the majority of Serbian politicians, since there was still a large number of Serbs remaining out of the Kingdom. [ May 2012 ] The Serbian victory in the First World War was supposed to serve as compensation to this situation and there was an open debate between the followers of the Greater Serbia doctrine, that defended the incorporation of the parts of the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire where Serbs lived to Serbia, opposed by the ones that supported an idea of uniting not only all the Serbian lands, but also to include other South Slav nations into a new country. Among other reasons, but also because of the fear of the creation of a bigger and stronger Orthodox Serbia, that could eventually became a Russian allied, the decision of making an ethnically mixed South Slav state, where other nationalities would balance the Serb hegemony, was made. [ May 2012 ] The Serbian Royal family of Karađorđević was set to rule this new state, called Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, that would be renamed to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. Initially, the apologists of the Greater Serbia doctrine felt satisfied, since the main goal of uniting all Serbian-inhabited lands under the rule of a Serbian Monarchic dynasty was mostly achieved. During the inter-war period, the majority of Serbian politicians defended a strong centralised country, while their opponents demanded major autonomy for the regions. This tension grew to a point that led to the creation of opposing nationalistic organisations that culminated in the assassination of the King Alexander I in 1934. [ May 2012 ] When the German invasion of Yugoslavia happened in 1941, these tensions grew to become one of the most brutal civil wars that occurred in World War II. The Royal Government soon capitulated, and the resistance was mainly made by the Četniks, who defended the restoration of the Monarchy, and the Partisans, who supported the creation of a communist Yugoslav state. The Serbs were divided into these two factions, that fought not only Nazi Germany and all the other neighbour Axis allied countries which also invaded different territories of Yugoslavia — the Italians, Hungarians and Bulgaria ns — but also each other. Beside this, other Yugoslav non-Serb nationalists took advantage of the situation and allied themselves with the Axis countries, regarding this moment as their historical opportunity of fulfilling their own irredentist aspirations, the Independent State of Croatia being by far the most brutal one. [ May 2012 ] After the war, victorious Partisan leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito became the head of state of Yugoslavia until his death in 1980. During this period the country was divided in six republics. In 1976, within the Socialist Republic of Serbia two autonomous provinces, SAP Kosovo and SAP Vojvodina, were created. During this period, most of the Greater Serbian ideology followers were incarcerated as accused of betrayall, or exiled. Within the rest of the Serbian population, the vast majority became strong supporters of this new Non-Aligned Yugoslavia. [ May 2012 ] During the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, Serbia stood accused of attempting to create the entity of a Greater Serbia through Belgrade&apos;s direct involvement with the unrecognised Serbian entities functioning in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

[ 3-4 ] He proposed ways to influence Croats and Slavic Muslims, who Garašanin regarded as &quot; Serbs of Catholic faith &quot; and &quot; Serbs of Islamic faith &quot;. [ 3 ] This plan was kept secret until 1967 and has been interpreted by some as a blueprint for Serbian national unification, with the primary concern of strengthening Serbia&apos;s position by inculcating Serbian and pro-Serbian national ideology in all surrounding peoples that are considered to be devoid of national consciousness. [ 3-4 ] [ 91 ] [ Vuk Karadžić&apos;s pan-Serbism ] The most notable Serbian linguist of the 19th century, Vuk Karadžić, was a follower of the view that all south Slavs that speak the štokavian dialect (in the central south Slavic language group ) are Serbs who speak the Serbian language. As this definition implied that large areas of continental Croatia, Dalmatia,and Bosnia and Herzegovina, including areas inhabited by Roman Catholics - Vuk Karadžić is considered by some to be the progenitor of the Greater Serbia program. More precisely, Karadžić was the shaper of modern secular Serbian national consciousness, with the goal of incorporating all indigenous štokavian speakers (Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim) into one, modern Serbian nation. This linguistic definition of nation would have excluded parts of southern Serbia where the Torlak dialect is spoken. [ May 2012 ] { Shtokavian dialect, whose speakers } { Vuk considered Serbs. } [ Danijela Nadj http://www.hic.hr/books/greatserbia/karadzic.htm Vuk Karadzic, Serbs All and Everywhere (1849) Hic.hr 2010-08-04 ] { Vuk Karadzic, Srbi svi i svuda(Serbs All and Everywhere) } This negative view is not shared by Andrew Baruch Wachtel (Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation) who sees him as a partisan of South Slav unity, albeit in a limited sense, in that his linguistic definition emphasized what united South Slavs rather than the religious differences that had earlier divided them. However, one might argue that such a definition is very partisan: Karadžić himself eloquently and explicitly professed that his aim was to unite all native štokavian speakers whom he identified as Serbs. Therefore, Vuk Karadžić&apos;s central linguistic-political aim was the growth of the realm of Serbdom according to his ethnic-linguistic ideas and not a unity of any sort between Serbian, Croatian or other nations. It has often been suggested that the Muslims of Bosnia are the descendants of Serbs who converted from Orthodox Christianity to Islam under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, but this is not true since Bosnians at that time were followers of Bosnian Church, an indigenous branch of the Bogomils that existed in Bosnia during the Middle Ages. [ May 2012 ] [ Early criticism ] Serbian writers and politicians in Austria-Hungary Svetozar Miletić and Mihailo Polit-Desančić fiercely opposed the Greater Serbia ideology, as well as the premier Serbian socialist from Serbia proper, Svetozar Marković. They all envisioned some sort of &quot; Balkan confederation &quot; that would include Serbia, Bulgaria and sometimes Romania, plus Vojvodina, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, should the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolve. [ May 2012 ] The term Greater Serbia first appears in a derogatory manner in a book authored by a Serbian socialist Svetozar Marković in 1872. The title «Velika Srbija» (Greater Serbia) was meant to express the author&apos;s dismay at the prospect of expansion of the Serbian state without social and cultural reforms as well as possible ethnic confrontation with neighboring nations, from Croats to Bulgarians. [ May 2012 ] [ Balkan Wars ] [ Serbia in the Balkan Wars ] The idea of reclaiming historic Serbian territory has been put into action several times during the 19th and 20th centuries, notably in Serbia&apos;s southward expansion in the Balkan Wars. Serbia claimed &quot; historical rights &quot; to the possession of Macedonia, acquired by Stephen Dušan in fourteenth century.

[ 159-164 ] The Kingdom of Serbia temporarily occupied most of the interior of Albania and Albania&apos;s Adriatic coast. A series of massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars were committed by the Serbian and Montenegrin Army. According to the Report of the International Commission on the Balkan Wars, Serbia consider annexed territories &quot; as a dependency, a sort of conquered colony, which these conquerors might administer at their good pleasure &quot;. Newly acquired territories were subjected to military government, and were not included in Serbia&apos;s constitutional system. The opposition press demanded the rule of law for the population of the annexed territories and the extension of the constitution of the Kingdom of Serbia to these regions. [ Black Hand ] [ Black Hand (Serbia) Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria ] Extremist Greater Serbian nationalist groups included the secret society called the Black Hand, headed by Serbian colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis, which took an active and militant stance on the issue of a Greater Serbian state. This organization is believed to have been responsible for numerous atrocities following the Balkan Wars in 1913. { Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars (p. 169) } In 1914, Bosnian Serb Black Hand member Gavrilo Princip was responsible the assassination of Habsburg Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, which set off an international crisis that led to the First World War. [ May 2012 ] [ First World War and creation of Yugoslavia ] [ Creation of Yugoslavia Serbianisation ] { Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars. } By 1914 the Greater Serbian concept was eventually replaced by the Yugoslav Pan-Slavic movement. The change in approach was meant as a means to gain support of other Slavs which neighboured Serbs who were also occupied by Austria-Hungary. The intention to create a south Slav or &quot; Yugoslav &quot; state was expressed in the Niš declaration by Serbian premier Nikola Pašić in 1914, as well as in Serbia&apos;s regent Aleksandar &apos;s statement in 1916. The documents showed that Serbia would pursue a policy that would integrate all territory that contained Serbs and southern Slavs, including Croatians, Slovenes and Bosnian Muslims. [ May 2012 ] In 1918, the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and Russia) defeated Germany and Austria-Hungary. Serbia, which was allied with the Entente, pressured the allies to give Serbia the territory it requested.

The authors of the Memorandum included the most influential Serbian intellectuals, among them: Pavle Ivić, Antonije Isaković, Dušan Kanazir, Mihailo Marković, Miloš Macura, Dejan Medaković, Miroslav Pantić, Nikola Pantić, Ljubiša Rakić, Radovan Samardžić, Miomir Vukobratović, Vasilije Krestić, Ivan Maksimović, Kosta Mihailović, Stojan Čelić and Nikola Čobelić. Christopher Bennett, author of Yugoslavia&apos;s Bloody Collapse: Causes, Course and Consequences, characterized the memorandum as &quot; an elaborate, if crude, conspiracy theory. &quot; [ Yugoslavia&apos;s Bloody Collapse: Causes, Course and Consequences Bennett Christopher 1995 C. Hurst &amp; Co.

According to Bennett, despite most of these claims being obviously absurd, the memorandum was merely one of several similar polemics published at the time. [ 81 ] The Memorandum&apos;s central theses are: [ May 2012 ] Yugoslavia is a Croatian-Slovene hegemony, in order to reduce the Serbs to a smaller representative group, or &quot; power-sharing &quot;. Serbs are, in Yugoslavia, oppressed as a nation. This oppression is especially brutal in Serbian Autonomous Province of Kossovo-Metochia, and in Croatia, where their status is &quot; the worst ever as far as recorded history goes &quot;. Serbia is economically exploited, being subjected to the political-economical mechanisms that drain much of her wealth and redistribute it to Slovenia, Croatia and Kossovo-Metochia. borders between Yugoslav republics are arbitrary, drawn by dominant Croatian and Slovene communists (motivated, supposedly, by anti-Serbian animus) and their Serbian political lapdogs. The Memorandum&apos;s defenders claims go as follows: far from calling for a breakup of Yugoslavia on Greater Serbian lines claimed to be in favor of Yugoslavia. Its support for Yugoslavia was however conditional on fundamental changes to end what the Memorandum argued was the discrimination against Serbia which was inbuilt into the Yugoslav constitution. The chief of these changes was abolition of the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to Norman Cigar, because the changes were unlikely to be accepted passively, the implementation of the Memorandum&apos;s program would only be possible by force.

According to Bennett, Milošević used a rigid control of the media to organize a propaganda campaign in which the Serbs were the victims and stressed the need to readjust Yugoslavia due to the alleged bias against Serbia. This was then followed by Milošević&apos;s anti-bureaucratic revolution in which the provincial governments of Vojvodina and Kosovo and the Republican government of Montenegro, were overthrown giving Milošević the dominating position of four votes out of eight in Yugoslavia&apos;s collective presidency. Milošević had achieved such a dominant position for Serbia because, according to Bennett, the old communist authorities had failed to stand up to him. During August 1988, supporters of the Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution were reported to have shouted Greater Serbia themed chants of &quot; Montenegro is Serbia! &quot;.

The coercive nature of creating a Greater Serbian state against the will of other nations; before the wars, the peoples of Yugoslavia were highly intermingled and it was physically impossible to create ethnic states without taking in large numbers of other ethnic groups against their will. An answer to this was the widespread use of ethnic cleansing to ensure that mono-ethnic territories could be established without opposition from potentially disloyal minority groups. A converse argument is used against the upgrading the status of Croatia and of Bosnia and Herzegovina from republics to independent states—taking in large numbers of other ethnic groups against their will in the process. Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, called for the creation of a Greater Serbia which would include Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina, Macedonia and Montenegro, as well as regions within Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia with high concentrations of Serbs.

Mihajlo Markovic, the Vice President of the Main Committee of Serbia&apos;s Socialist Party, rejected any solution that would make Serbs outside Serbia a minority.
