{ Tower Hill } The Port of London lies along the banks of the River Thames from London, England to the North Sea. Once the largest port in the world, it is currently the United Kingdom &apos;s second largest port, after Grimsby &amp; Immingham. The port is governed by the Port of London Authority (PLA), a public trust established in 1908, whose responsibility extends over the Tideway of the River Thames. The port can handle cruise liners, ro-ro ferries and cargo of all types including containers, timber, paper, vehicles, aggregates, crude oil, petroleum products, liquified petroleum gas, coal, metals, grain and other dry and liquid bulk materials. In 2008 the Port of London handled 53.0 million tonnes of trade (up from 52.7 million tonnes in 2007), including 2,007,000 TEU s and 20.5 million tonnes of oil and related products. { Port of London Annual Review 2008 (published in 2009) } The port is not located in one area - it stretches along the tidal Thames, including central London, with many individual wharf s, dock s, terminals and facilities built incrementally over the centuries. As with many similar historic European ports, such as Rotterdam, the bulk of activities has steadily moved downstream towards the open sea, as ships have grown larger and other city uses take up land closer to the city&apos;s centre. [ History ] The Port of London has been central to the economy of London since the founding of the city in the 1st century and was a major contributor to the growth and success of the city. In the 18th and 19th centuries it was the busiest port in the World, with wharves extending continuously along the Thames for [ 11 mi km ], and over 1,500 crane s handling 60,000 ship s per year. In World War II it was a prime target for the Luftwaffe during The Blitz. [ The Roman Port in London ] The first evidence of a reasonable sized trading in London can be seen during 50 to 270 BCE, at which time the Romans built the original harbour. The construction involved expanding the waterfront using wooden frames filled with dirt. Once these were in place the wharf was built in four stages moving downstream from the London Bridge (Brigham). The port began to rapidly grow and prosper during the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and saw its final demise in the early 5th century with the decline in trade activity. The changes made to the banks along the port made by the Romans are so substantial and long lasting that it was hard to tell where the natural waterfront really began (Milne). London became a very important trading port for the Romans at its height in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The harbour town grew and expanded quickly. The lavish nature of goods traded in London shaped the extravagant lifestyle of its citizens and the city flourished under Roman colonization (Hall &amp; Merrifield). The Roman expansion of port facilities and organisation of the London harbour have remained as the base of the London harbour until today. [ Pool of London ] Legal Quays between Billingsgate Dock and the Tower of London in John Rocque&apos;s plan of 1746. Behind Legal Quays lay Thames Street, with its warehouses, sugar refineries and cooperages. Until the beginning of the 19th century shipping was handled entirely within the Pool of London on the stretch of the River Thames along Billingsgate on the south side of the City of London. All imported cargoes had to be delivered for inspection and assessment by Customs Officers, giving the area the name of &quot; Legal Quays &quot;. [ Museum of London http://www.museumindocklands.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Themes/DevelopmentPortDocks.htm Museum of London Docklands Museumindocklands.org.uk 2010-04-30 ] The Pool saw a phenomenal increase in both overseas and coastal trade in the second half of the 18th century. Two thirds of coastal vessels using the Pool were colliers meeting an increase in the demand for coal as the population of London rose. Coastal trade virtually doubled between 1750 and 1796 reaching 11,964 vessels in 1795. In overseas trade, in 1751 the pool handled 1,682 ships and 234,639 tons of goods. By 1794 this had risen to 3,663 ships and 620,845 tons. [ http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid%3D46493 &apos; &amp; #39;The West India Docks: Introduction&apos; &amp; #39;, Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs (1994), pp. 247-248. Date accessed: 16 April 2010 British-history.ac.uk 2003-06-22 2010-04-30 ] By this time the river was lined with nearly continuous walls of wharves running for miles along both banks, and hundreds of ships moored in the river or alongside the quays. In the late 18th century an ambitious scheme was proposed by Willey Reveley to straighten the Thames between Wapping and Woolwich Reach by cutting a new channel across the Rotherhithe, Isle of Dogs and Greenwich peninsulas. The three great horseshoe bends would be cut off with locks, as huge wet docks. { Clout, H. (Ed) 1994, The Times London History Atlas, Times Books, ISBN 0-7230-0342-4 } This was not realised, though a much smaller channel, the City Canal was subsequently cut across the Isle of Dogs. [ Enclosed dock systems ] James Elmes&apos; chart of the port, 1837, showing the enclosed docks at the beginning of Queen Victoria&apos;s reign. London&apos;s Docklands had their origins in the lack of capacity in the Pool of London which particularly affected the West India trade. In 1799 The West India Dock Act allowed a new off-river dock to be built for produce from the West Indies and the rest of Docklands followed as landowners built enclosed docks with better security and facilities than the Pool&apos;s wharves. Throughout the 19th century a series of enclosed dock systems was built, surrounded by high walls to protect cargoes from river piracy. These included West India Docks (1802), East India Docks (1803, originating from the Brunswick Dock of 1790), London Docks (1805), Surrey Commercial Docks (1807, originating from the Howland Great Wet Dock of 1696), St Katharine Docks (1828), Royal Victoria Dock (1855), Millwall Dock (1868), Royal Albert Dock (1880), and Tilbury docks (1886). The enclosed docks were built by several rival private companies, notably the East &amp; West India Docks Company (owners of the East India, West India and Tilbury docks), Surrey Commercial Docks Company and London &amp; St Katharine Docks Company (owners of the London, St Katharine and Royal docks). By the beginning of the 20th century competition and strikes led to pressure for amalgamation. A Royal Commission led to the setting up of the Port of London Authority (PLA) in 1908. In 1909 the PLA took control of the enclosed docks from Tower Bridge to Tilbury, with a few minor exceptions such as Poplar Dock which remained as a railway company facility. It also took over control of the river between Teddington Lock and Yantlet Creek from the City corporation which had been responsible since the 13th century. The PLA head Office at Trinity Square Gardens was built by John Mowlem &amp; Co and completed in 1919. The PLA dredged a deep water channel, added the King George V Dock (1920) to the Royal group, and made continuous improvements to the other enclosed dock systems throughout the first two thirds of the 20th century. This culminated in expansion of Tilbury in the late 1960s to become a major container port (the UK&apos;s largest in the early 1970s), together with a huge riverside grain terminal and mechanised facilities for timber handling. Under the PLA London&apos;s annual trade had grown to 60 million tons (38% of UK trade) by 1939, but was mainly transferred to the Clyde and Liverpool during World War 2. After the war London recovered, again reaching 60 million tons in the 1960s. { King George V Dock (and } { Tilbury Docks, much further downstream) had not yet been built. } [ 30 acre ha ] [ 24 acre ha ] [ 3 mi km on ] [ 18 acre ha ] [ 7 mi km on ] [ 20 acre ha ] [ 7 acre ha ] [ 30 acre ha ] [ 1.5 mi km on ] [ 10 acre ha ] [ 460 acre ha ] [ 4 mi km on ] [ 23 acre ha ] [ 1 mi km on ] [ 8 mi km on ] [ 3.5 mi km on ] [ 36 acre ha ] [ 200 acre ha ] [ 4 mi km on ] [ 11.5 mi km on ] [ 25 mi km on ] [ 64 acre ha ] [ 11 mi km on ] Summary timeline Principal enclosed docks of the Port of London Year Name Company Area (water area unless stated) Location name Side of river Approx. river distance below London Bridge Comments 1802 West India Docks E &amp; WIDC North (Import) Dock:; Middle (Export) Dock: Isle of Dogs north 1803 East India Docks E &amp; WIDC Blackwall north originating from the Brunswick Dock of 1790 1805 London Docks ?

Other industries have included iron working, lead smelting, casting of brass and bronze, shipbuilding, timber, grain, cement and paper milling, armament manufacture, etc. London dominated the world submarine communication cable industry for decades with works at Greenwich, Silvertown, North Woolwich, Woolwich, and Erith. For centuries London was the major centre of shipbuilding in Britain (for example at Blackwall Yard, London Yard, Samuda Yard, Millwall Iron Works, Thames Ironworks, Greenwich, and Deptford and Woolwich dockyards), but declined relative to the Clyde and other centres from the mid 19th century. This also affected an attempt by Henry Bessemer to establish steel-making on the Greenwich Peninsula in the 1860s. [ http://www.history.rochester.edu/ehp-book/shb/hb21.htm Bessemer&apos;s autobiography Chapter 21 History.rochester.edu 2010-04-30 ] The last major warship, HMS Thunderer, was launched in 1911. The volume of shipping in the Port of London supported a very extensive ship repairing industry. In 1864, when most ships coming in were built of wood and powered by sail, there were 33 ship-repairing dry docks. The largest of these was Langley&apos;s Lower Dock at Deptford Green, which was [ 460 ft m on ] in length. While the building of large ships ceased with the closure of the Thames Ironwork &amp; Shipbuilding Company at Leamouth in 1912, the ship repairing trade continued to flourish. Although by 1930 the number of major dry docks had been reduced to 16, highly mechanised and geared to the repair of iron and steel-hulled ships. { Dockland Life: A Pictorial History of London&apos;s Docks, 1860-1970 by Chris Ellmers and Alex Werner, Mainstream Publishing Company, Edinburgh, 1995, ISBN 1-85158-364-5 } There were also numerous power stations and gas works on the Thames and its tributaries and canals. Major Thames-side gasworks were located at Beckton and East Greenwich, with power stations including Brimsdown, Hackney and West Ham on the River Lea and Kingston, Fulham, Lots Road, Wandsworth, Battersea, Bankside, Stepney, Deptford, Greenwich, Blackwall Point, Brunswick Wharf, Woolwich, Barking, Belvedere, Littlebrook, West Thurrock, Northfleet, Tilbury and Grain on the Thames. The coal requirements of power stations and gas works constituted a large proportion of London&apos;s post-war trade. A 1959 Times article [ Industries along the Riverside Special Correspondent news Mon March 16, 1959 xi 54410 A ] states: [ About two-thirds of the 20 million tons of coal entering the Thames each year is consumed in nine gas works and 17 generating stations. Beckton Gas Works carbonises an average of 4,500 tons of coal every day; the largest power stations burn about 3,000 tons during a winter day.... Three more power stations, at Belvedere (Oil-firing), and Northfleet and West Thurrock (coal-firing), are being built. ] This coal was handled directly by riverside coal handling facilities, rather than the docks. For example Beckton Gas Works had two large piers which dealt with both its own requirements and with the transfer of coal to lighters for delivery to other gasworks. A considerable proportion of the drop in London&apos;s trade since the 1960s is accounted for by loss of the coal trade, the gas works having closed following discovery of North Sea Gas, domestic use of coal for heating being largely replaced by gas and electricity, and closure of all the coal-burning power stations above Tilbury. [ The move downstream ] { Tilbury in 1946, before major expansion as a container port. } With the use of larger ships and containerisation, the importance of the upstream port declined rapidly from the mid-1960s. The enclosed docks further up river declined and closed progressively between the end of the 1960s and the early 1980s. Trade at privately owned wharves on the open river continued for longer, for example with container handling at the Victoria Deep Water Terminal on the Greenwich Peninsula into the 1990s, and bulk paper import at Convoy&apos;s Wharf in Deptford until 2000. The wider port continued to be a major centre for trade and industry, with oil refineries and terminals at Coryton, Shell Haven and Canvey in Essex and the Isle of Grain in Kent. In 1992 Government privatisation policy led to Tilbury becoming a freeport. The PLA ceased to be a port operator, retaining the role of managing the Thames. Much of the disused land of the upstream London Docklands is in the process of being developed for housing and as a second financial district for London (centred on Canary Wharf ). [ The Port today ] [ List of locations in the Port of London ] Container ship &apos;&apos;Carpathia&apos;&apos; unloading at Northfleet Hope terminal, Tilbury The Port of London today comprises over 70 independently owned terminals and port facilities, directly employing over 30,000 people. [ http://www.pla.co.uk/display_fixedpage.cfm/id/520/site/pla Port of London Economic Impact Study Port of London Authority 31 March 2009 ] These are mainly concentrated at Purfleet (with the world&apos;s largest margarine works), Thurrock, Tilbury (the Port&apos;s current main container facility), Coryton and Canvey Island in Essex, Dartford and Northfleet in Kent, and Greenwich, Silvertown, Barking, Dagenham and Erith in Greater London. In 2007 London was the second largest port in the United Kingdom by tonnage handled (52.7 million), after Grimsby and Immingham (66.3 million). { Port of London Annual Review 2008 (published in 2009)) } Tees and Hartlepool was the UK&apos;s third largest port in 2007 and has a similar annual tonnage handled as London (in 2006 a slightly greater tonnage was handled in Tees and Hartlepool than at London). The Port of London however handles the most non-fuel cargo of any port in the UK (at 32.2 million tonnes in 2007). Other major rival ports to London in the country are Felixstowe and Southampton, which handle the most and second-most number of containers of British ports. The number of twenty-foot equivalent unit s of containers handled by the Port of London exceeded 2 million in 2007 for the first time in the Port&apos;s history and this continued in 2008. The Port&apos;s capacity in handling modern, large ships and containers is set to dramatically expand with the completion of the London Gateway port project, which will be able to handle up to 3.5 million TEUs per year when fully completed. With around 12,500 commercial shipping movements annually, the Port of London handles around 10% of the UK commercial shipping trade, and contributes 8.5 billion pounds to the UK&apos;s economy. In addition to cargo, 37 cruise ship s visited the Port in 2008. { Silvertown, } { London } Although the Kent ( BP ) and Shell Haven ( Shell ) refineries closed in 1982 and 1999, Coryton remains in production. A number of upstream wharves remain in use. At Silvertown for example Tate &amp; Lyle continues to operate the world&apos;s largest cane sugar refinery, originally served by the West India Docks but now with its own cargo handling facilities. Many wharves as far upstream as Fulham are used for the handling of aggregates brought by barge from facilities down river. Riverside sites in London are under intense pressure for prestige housing or office development, and as a consequence the Greater London Authority in consultation with the PLA has implemented a plan to safeguard 50 wharves within Greater London, half above and half below the Thames Barrier. [ http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning/docs/safeguarded_wharves_05.pdf PDF London Plan Implementation Report: Safeguarded Wharves on the River Thames Mayor of London 2005 31 March 2009 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] [ Intraport traffic ] In recent years there has been a resurgence in the use of the River Thames for moving cargo between terminals within the Port of London. This is seen to be in the main part due to the environmental benefits of moving such cargo by river, and as an alternative to transporting the cargo on the congested road and rail networks of the capital. Local authorities are contributing to this increase in intraport traffic, with waste transfer and demolition rubble being taken by barges on the river. At present the construction of the Olympic Park and Crossrail are both utilising the river as a means of transporting cargo and waste/excavation material. The Crossrail project alone will involve the transporting of 5 million tonnes of material (almost all of which is clean earth, excavated from the ground) downstream through the Port, from locations such as Canary Wharf to new nature reserves being constructed in the Thames estuary area. { PLA News Crossrail will move 5m tonnes via River } In 2008, the figure for intraport trade was 1.9 million tonnes, making the River Thames the busiest inland waterway in the UK. [ Proposed expansion ] { London Gateway under way, 2010. } In terms of number of containers, London currently ranks third in the UK after the ports of Southampton and Felixstowe. This is likely to change in future as a major new facility at the Shell Haven refinery site - DP World&apos;s London Gateway - is under construction. Government approval was given in May 2007 for the redevelopment of this 607 hectare (1,500 acre) brownfield site, which has a two mile (3 km) river frontage. The developers plan a port capable of handling the largest deep-sea container ships, including a 2,300 metre long container quay with a capacity of 3.5 million standard container units a year. The development will also include a 300 hectare (700 acre) &apos;logistics and business park&apos;, with direct links to the rail network. { P &amp; O London Gateway decision press release } This might re-establish London&apos;s pre-eminence as originally intended by the PLA in the 1960s with its proposed development of a deep-sea port at Maplin Sands as part of the proposed third London airport site. [ Policing the Port ] The Port of London once had its own police force - the Port of London Authority Police - but is today policed by a number of forces. These are the local Home Office forces of the areas the Thames passes through (the Metropolitan, City of London, Essex and Kent constabularies) and the Port of Tilbury Police (formed in 1992 and a remnant of the old PLA force). The Metropolitan police have a special Marine Support Unit, formerly known as the Thames Division, which patrol and police the Thames in the Greater London area. A sixth police force in the Port may be established with the creation of the London Gateway port.
