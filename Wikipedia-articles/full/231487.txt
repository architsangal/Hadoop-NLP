[ New ThunderCats Series Announced IGN http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1094318p1.html 2010-06-03 ] [ Plot ] ThunderCats follows the adventures of the eponymous team of heroes, cat-like humanoid aliens from a planet called Thundera. The series pilot begins with the dying planet Thundera meeting its end, forcing the ThunderCats (a sort of Thunderean nobility ) to flee their homeworld. The fleet is attacked by the Thundereans&apos; enemies, the Mutants of Plun-Darr, who destroy most of the starships in the &quot; ThunderFleet, &quot; but spare the flagship hoping to capture the legendary mystic Sword of Omens they believe is on board. The sword holds the Eye of Thundera, the source of the ThunderCats&apos; power, which is embedded in the hilt. Though the Mutants damage the flagship, the power of the Eye drives them back. The damage to the ship means the journey to their original destination is not possible, instead having to journey to &quot; Third Earth &quot;; which will take much longer than they had anticipated. The eldest of the ThunderCats, Jaga, volunteers to pilot the ship while the others sleep in capsules; however, he dies of old age in the process, but not before ensuring they will reach their destination safely. The flagship contains the young Lord of the ThunderCats, Lion-O, as well as the ThunderCats Cheetara, Panthro, Tygra, WilyKit and WilyKat, and Snarf. When the ThunderCats awake from their suspended animation on Third Earth, Lion-O discovers that his suspension capsule has slowed, rather than stopped, his aging, and he is now a child in the body of an adult. Together, the ThunderCats and the friendly natives of Third Earth construct the &quot; Cat&apos;s Lair, &quot; their new home and headquarters, but before long, the Mutants have tracked them down to Third Earth. The intrusion of these two alien races upon the world does not go unnoticed, however - a demonic, mummified sorcerer calling himself Mumm-Ra recruits the Mutants to aid him in his campaign to acquire the Eye of Thundera and destroy the ThunderCats so that his evil may continue to hold sway over Third Earth. [ Thundercats Season One Volume Two IGN 2008-05-13 http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/675/675634p1.html 2008-10-06 ] According to the first chapter of Wildstorm ’s comic ThunderCats Origins: Heroes and Villains, the Third Earth is actually our Earth in the future; the present day is &quot; First Earth. &quot; Mumm-Ra originates from ancient Egypt, where he first enslaved himself to the Ancient Spirits of Evil in exchange for his tremendous powers and knowledge of the Universe. He is – seemingly – the one responsible for destroying the human race, after he broke free from the onyx pyramid’s burial chamber, inside which a Pharaoh&apos;s son had imprisoned him. [ Seasons ] [ List of ThunderCats episodes ] [ Season 1 ] This status holds strong for the first season of the show, and served as the basis for a vast array of stories that freely mixed elements of science fiction and fantasy into a traditional good-versus-evil tale that steadily introduced more and more recurring allies and villains into the world of the ThunderCats. Futuristic technology is just as central to the series as magic and myth, but even in the midst of all this action, the series never under-emphasizes the importance of moral values in solving problems. Each episode would normally include a short dénouement, featuring the characters recuperating after the events of the story and taking the time to single out a personal value or wholesome approach that helped save the day, or could have done so if they had not seen it. The first half of Season 1 featured a gentle continuity, with early episodes following on from one another and establishing recurring concepts, although this became less common as the season transitioned into its second half, which comprised mostly incidental one-shot adventures. Tying the second half of season one together was the over-arching five-part adventure written by series head writer Leonard Starr, &quot; Lion-O&apos;s Anointment, &quot; in which an unarmed Lion-O faced off against first the other ThunderCats, and then Mumm-Ra, so he could truly earn his title as Lord of the ThunderCats. The five parts were: &quot; Day One: The Trial Of Strength, &quot; in which Lion-O had to out-do Panthro, &quot; Day Two: The Trial Of Speed, &quot; in which Cheetara was his antagonist, &quot; Day Three: The Trial Of Cunning, &quot; in which he had to outwit both of the &quot; ThunderKittens, &quot; WilyKat and WilyKit, &quot; Day Four: The Trial Of Mind-Power, &quot; which pitted him against Tygra, and &quot; Last Day: The Trial Of Evil, &quot; wherein Lion-O discovered that Mumm-Ra was highly dependent on the sarcophagus inside which he had been mummified. On all four days except the last, the Mutants tried to interfere with Lion-O&apos;s trials so that they could force the ThunderCats to remain leaderless. The other ThunderCats were then forced to involve themselves in the conflict to foil the Mutants&apos;s interferences--all while trying to avoid assisting Lion-O in his anointment trials. Although intended to be viewed consecutively (as the adventures depicted occurred one day after the other), the five parts of the mini-series were erroneously aired (and released on DVD) with multiple other episodes between each installment. [ ThunderCats - Ho! ] The 1986 TV movie &quot; ThunderCats - Ho! &quot; featured the first major shake-up to the status quo of the series, introducing three new Thundereans (whom Lion-O later anointed as ThunderCats) who had also survived the destruction of Thundera. A massive cast of returning heroes and villains were incorporated into the story and concluded with the apparent destruction of Mumm-Ra. Leonard Starr wrote the story for this TV movie. [ February 2012 ] [ Season 2 ] When the series returned in 1987, however, it was revealed that the evil wizard, Mumm-Ra had survived. &quot; Mumm-Ra Lives! &quot; set the pattern for the following three seasons, which each began with a five-part mini-series, again written by Leonard Starr, that established the new characters and concepts that would go on to influence the rest of the season. In the case of &quot; Mumm-Ra Lives! &quot;, these concepts included the debut of the villainous Lunataks, who became a third faction that existed for the rest of the series, and the new team of ThunderCats from ThunderCats - Ho! being given their own headquarters, vehicles and so forth. [ Season 3 ] The 1988 season began with the Peter Lawrence-scripted &quot; ThunderCubs, &quot; which, though named for its plot about the ThunderCats being transformed into children, was principally about Mumm-Ra reconstructing Thundera in order to retrieve both the weapon that had originally destroyed it (the Sword of Plun-Darr) and the legendary Treasure of Thundera. In the course of the adventure, the treasure - containing the Book of Omens, a tome holding all the secrets of the ThunderCats, and many other mystical items - was scattered across the New Thundera, ushering in a new concept for the series: a season with an actual story arc. Continuity between episodes became tighter as the ThunderCats, Mutants, Lunataks and Mumm-Ra alternated their adventures between Third Earth and New Thundera, searching for the treasure and exploiting its powers. The season also featured the running theme of the Ancient Spirits of Evil having to take a more active hand in pushing Mumm-Ra into action, culminating in another unique feature of the season - an actual finale episode, &quot; The Last Day, &quot; in which the Spirits give Mumm-Ra one last chance to destroy the ThunderCats. Ultimately, the villain failed, and the Spirits exiled him to the farthest corner of the Universe. [ Season 4 ] However, Mumm-Ra returned for the 1989 season. In the opening mini-series, Peter Lawrence&apos;s &quot; Return to Thundera! &quot;, the ThunderCats returned to New Thundera to rebuild their society, but before departing, they destroyed Mumm-Ra&apos;s pyramid. This enraged the Ancient Spirits of Evil to the point that they brought Mumm-Ra back, and installed him within a new pyramid on New Thundera. The season proved to be quite divorced from what had gone before, with adventures consigned almost entirely to New Thundera, and most villainous opposition coming from either Mumm-Ra or assorted new villains. The Mutants, Lunataks and Captain Cracker all returned for one episode each, however. In the series finale, several conclusions are reached: Mumm-Ra stands up to, and successfully asserts himself over, the Ancient Spirits of Evil; the mystery of the Book of Omens was at last solved; and the tumultuous and terrifying environment of Thundera was at last rendered peaceful and pristine. [ Characters ] [ List of ThunderCats characters ] [ Cast ] Despite its large cast of characters, ThunderCats featured a rather small circle of voice actor s, with only six actors providing voices for the entire first season. Every actor provided multiple voices, although the distinctive baritone of Earle Hyman (Panthro) left the actor providing only very occasional guest voices in comparison with his fellow performers. In particular, as the first season&apos;s only female actor, Lynne Lipton (Cheetara and WilyKit) provided voices for every single female character that appeared in the season. Above all others, however, actor Bob McFadden would most regularly provide the voices of guest characters, with his two diametrically-opposed main roles - the timid, high-pitched Snarf and the rumbling, sibilant Slithe. Despite introducing a large number of new regular characters, the show&apos;s second season brought in only two new actors. Gerrianne Raphael provided the voice of Pumyra, and was able to provide Lynne Lipton with some relief by adding new female voices.

[ Battle of the Fun Factories Time 1985-12-16 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C960379-2%2C00.html 2010-03-03 ] The ThunderCats line was based on the animated series which was actually created in 1982. Due to difficulties, it would not air until 1985. (The toyline actually lasted longer than the television series itself) Each figure had an action feature of some sort, and the line also included a unique &quot; laser &quot; light-up feature that interacted between the Cats&apos; Lair playset, some figures, and some accessories. Lion-O&apos;s eyes and Mumm-Ra&apos;s eyes would illuminate when a special battery-powered key ring that came with the figure was pressed into a slot in their backs. PVC companions were packaged with some figures in 1986, including WilyKat with Tygra, WilyKit with Cheetara, Snarf with Lion-O, and Ma-Mutt with Mumm-Ra. The PVC companion figures were also produced as full size articulated figures. LJN did produce a few variant figures including the young Tygra version and the silver rat-eye daggers for Rataro. There are also a few slight color variations of Lion-O, such as red and orange-haired versions. The third series of figures from 1987 are harder to find along with the Tongue-A-Saurus and Astral Moat Monster. Driller and Stinger are the toughest figures to track down; Stinger&apos;s wings are very fragile, making it next to impossible to find a loose, complete figure. An unproduced final series of figures would have included The Mad Bubbler, Red-Eye of the Lunataks, Ratilla, Cannon-Blaster and Quick-Jaws from the Bezerkers as well as the Feliner, Thunderstrike and Luna Tacker. The Mad Bubbler is rumored to have been produced, but this has yet to be proven. Photos of these were featured in the 1987 LJN catalog. In 1987, Elite Systems released the game ThunderCats: The Lost Eye of Thundera, for Commodore64/128 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum personal computer systems. Many years later, Cartoon Network &apos;s official website featured a game that allowed visitors to play as Lion-O and rescue fellow ThunderCats while venturing into Mumm-Ra&apos;s tomb (this game, titled, &quot; Thundercats: Tomb of Mumm-raa, &quot; can be found on an archived Toonami database). Other ThunderCats merchandise of the 1980s included, among other items, a board game, TV tray table, an electronic racing set, tin lunch box and apparel. A retro spurt occurred in the mid 1990&apos;s and 2000s that began with the familiar 1980&apos;s ThunderCats emblem on t-shirts and has since grown to include new t-shirt designs and various other ThunderCats-themed apparel such as hats and belt buckles. In May 2009, Warner Brothers gave Hard Hero the rights to produce a line of collectible statues based on the ThunderCats characters. [ Hard Hero Statues http://www.thundercatslair.org/collectibles/hard-heroes-statues/ ] In June 2010, Bandai announced that new toylines will be released, based on both the classic and the 2011 series.

Hembrough also announced that Hollywood Heroes would be the sole broker for a large collection of prototype toys and original artwork. At the time of his post, Hembrough commented on the collection, stating it be &quot; the largest in recorded history. &quot; Hembrough added that the value lay not only in the incredible pieces that made up the inventory, but also the fact that the items came from the personal collections of LJN designers and could be traced backed to them directly. Mezco Toyz announced in February 2011 that they acquired the ThunderCats license to produce large scale rotocast figures based on the 1980s animated series. Lion-O was the first announced figure and is expected to be released sometime in July. [ June 2011 ] [ Bandai ThunderCats toys ] Bandai revealed a brand new line of ThunderCats toys at the 2011 International New York Toy Fair. The new line will consist of a 4 &quot; and 6 &quot; action figure line based on the new animated series, set to hit Cartoon Network in Fall of 2011. In addition, the 4 &quot; line will include basic and deluxe vehicles, as well as a Tower of Omens playset. Bandai will also be producing an 8 &quot; Collector&apos;s Classic line based on the 1980s animated series. The toys will hit U.S. retailers sometime in the August/September 2011 timeframe.

The movie was released on VHS in the UK but not in the USA. It was later edited into the five episodes which ultimately led to season 2 (even though season 2 never aired in the UK). In 2008-2009, Warner Bros. was in the process of creating a CGI animated film based on ThunderCats. It was rumored to be an original story expanding on the events of the first episode and the film&apos;s concept artwork (released in July 2009) contained the main character Lion-O and three locations. A two minute test scene was filmed and presented to Warner Brothers, however the movie has been put on indefinite hold perhaps due to the critical and commercial failure of the 2008 movie &quot; Speed Racer &quot; (another Warner Brothers CGI project).

The new series makes it clear in the very beginning, however, that they are not adhering to the original story line. In the original series the Thunder Cats leave Thundera, as the last of their race, to eventually arrive on 3rd earth. In the new series the very first line states that the Thundereans are already on 3rd earth.
