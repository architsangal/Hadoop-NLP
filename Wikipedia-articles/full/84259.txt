It is part of the administrative region of Central Greece. It stretches from the western mountainsides of Parnassus on the east to the mountain range of Vardousia on the west, upon the Gulf of Corinth. It is named after the ancient region of Phocis, but the modern regional unit also includes parts of ancient Locris and Doris. [ Geography ] Modern Phocis has an area of 2120  km² (819  mi²), of which 560  km² (216  mi²) are forested, 36  km² (14  mi²) are plains, and the remainder is mountainous.

The neighboring prefectures are Aetolia-Acarnania to the west, Phthiotis to the north and Boeotia to the east. Much of the south and east are deforested and rocky and mountainous while the valley runs from Itea up to Amfissa. Forests and greenspaces are to the west, the central part and the north. Its reservoir is the Mornos Dam on the Mornos river. It covers nearly 1  km to 3  km². It was completed in the 1960s, and GR-48 was extended to pass through the dam. [ Administration ] The regional unit Phocis is subdivided into 2 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox): [ Kallikratis reform law text ] Delphi (Delfoi, 1) Dorida (2) [ Prefecture ] Phocis was created as a prefecture in 1947 out of the Phthiotis and Phocis Prefecture. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Phocis was created out of the former prefecture Phocis ( [ Νομός Φωκίδας ] ). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.
