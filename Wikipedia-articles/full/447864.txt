The observational status of Stephan&apos;s Quintet Astronomy and Astrophysics, 1998 334 473–481 1998A &amp; A...334..473M astro-ph/9802328 ] Stephan&apos;s Quintet in the constellation Pegasus is a visual grouping of five galaxies of which four form the first compact galaxy group ever discovered. The group was discovered by Édouard Stephan in 1877 at Marseilles Observatory. [ Stephan, M. E. Nebulæ (new) discovered and observed at the observatory of Marseille, 1876 and 1877, M. Stephan Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 1877 37 334–339 1877MNRAS..37..334S ] The group is the most studied of all the compact galaxy groups. The brightest member of the visual grouping is NGC 7320 that is shown to have extensive H II region s, identified as red blobs, where active star formation is occurring. [ Description ] These galaxies are of interest because of their violent collisions. Four of the five galaxies in Stephan&apos;s Quintet form a physical association, Hickson Compact Group 92, and are involved in a cosmic dance that most likely will end with the galaxies merging. Radio observations in the early 1970s revealed a mysterious filament of emission which lies in inter-galactic space between the galaxies in the group. This same region is also detected in the faint glow of ionized atomic hydrogen seen in the visible part of the spectrum as the magnificent green arc in the picture to the right. Two space telescopes have recently provided new insight into the nature of the strange filament, which is now believed to be a giant intergalactic shock-wave (similar to a sonic boom but traveling in intergalactic gas rather than air) caused by one galaxy (NGC 7318B) falling into the center of the group at several millions of miles per hour. [ X-ray source ] Stephan&apos;s Quintet, a compact group of galaxies discovered about 130 years ago and located about 280 million light years from Earth, provides a rare opportunity to observe a galaxy group in the process of evolving from an X-ray faint system dominated by spiral galaxies to a more developed system dominated by elliptical galaxies and bright X-ray emission. Being able to witness the dramatic effect of collisions in causing this evolution is important for increasing our understanding of the origins of the hot, X-ray bright halos of gas in groups of galaxies.

As NGC 7318B collides with gas in the group, a huge shock wave bigger than the Milky Way spreads throughout the medium between the galaxies, heating some of the gas to temperatures of millions of degrees where they emit X-rays detectable with the NASA Chandra X-ray Observatory. [ Molecular hydrogen emission ] Perhaps even more unexpected is the discovery of very powerful molecular hydrogen signals from the shock wave, seen by the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope which detects infrared radiation. The molecular hydrogen emission, which is seen through infrared spectral analysis using the Spitzer Space Telescope is one of the most turbulent formations of molecular hydrogen ever seen, and the strongest emission originates near the center of the green area in the visible light picture discussed earlier. This phenomenon was discovered by an international team led by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and includes scientists from Australia, Germany and China. The detection of molecular hydrogen from the collision was initially unexpected because the hydrogen molecule is very fragile and is easily destroyed in shock waves of the kind expected in Stephan&apos;s Quintet. However, one solution is that when a shock front moves through a cloudy medium like the center of the group, millions of smaller shocks are produced in a turbulent layer, and this can allow molecular hydrogen to survive. Most notable is the fact that this collision can help provide a view into what happened in the postulated beginning of the universe some 14 billion years ago, since shocked molecular hydrogen is likely to be present in the early universe. [ Redshift ] Also of interest, NGC 7320 (to the lower left in both photos) indicates a small redshift (790  km/s) while the other four exhibit large redshifts (near 6600  km/s). Since galactic redshift is proportional to distance, NGC 7320 is only a foreground projection and is ~39 million ly from Earth versus the 210-340 million ly of the other five. NGC 7319 has a type 2 Seyfert nucleus. [ Members ] { Hubble Space Telescope image below. } The five visually adjacent galaxies of Stephan&apos;s Quintet are NGC 7317–7320. NGC  7320, however, is a foreground object roughly 40 million ly away, significantly closer than the others at about 290 million ly, and not part of the Hickson association. The visual distinction between 7320 and the others in the 2009 HST image below is quite striking. A sixth galaxy, NGC  7320C, probably belongs to the association: it has a redshift similar to the Hickson galaxies, and a tidal tail appears to connect it with NGC  7319.   [ NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database Results for various galaxies http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/ 2006-10-20 ] [ 22 35 51.9 ] [ +33 56 42 ] [ 22 35 56.7 ] [ +33 57 56 ] [ 22 35 58.4 ] [ +33 57 57 ] [ 22 36 03.5 ] [ +33 58 33 ] [ 22 36 20.4 ] [ +33 59 06 ] Members of the Hickson Compact Group 92 Name Type R.A.
