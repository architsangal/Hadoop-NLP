The following outline is presented as an overview of and topical guide to discrete mathematics: Discrete mathematics – study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real number s that have the property of varying &quot; smoothly &quot;, the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integer s, graphs, and statements in logic { Richard Johnsonbaugh, Discrete Mathematics, Prentice Hall, 2008. } – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. [ Discrete mathematics DiscreteMathematics ] Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in &quot; continuous mathematics &quot; such as calculus and analysis. Included below are many of the standard terms used routinely in university-level courses and in research papers. This is not, however, intended as a complete list of mathematical terms; just a selection of typical terms of art that may be encountered.
