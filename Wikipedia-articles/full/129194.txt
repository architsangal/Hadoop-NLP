He also managed many other musical artists, such as Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and The Dakotas, Cilla Black, The Remo Four, and The Cyrkle. His management company was named NEMS Enterprises after his family&apos;s music stores, also called NEMS (North End Music Stores). Epstein paid for The Beatles to record a demonstration tape in Decca&apos;s London studios, which resulted in Decca declining to sign the group to a contract. After approaching nearly all all the major recording companies and recording producers in London and being rejected, Epstein managed to secure an EMI recording contract under threat of withdrawing the sale of EMI&apos;s records at his NEMS music stores. NEMS was one of the biggest musical retail outlets in the North of England. [ Spitz 2005 264 ] Record producer George Martin offered a contract on behalf of EMI&apos;s small Parlophone label, only when informed of the economic threat to EMI by Epstein. Epstein died of an accidental drug overdose at his home in London in August 1967. The Beatles&apos; early success has been attributed to Epstein&apos;s management and sense of style. Paul McCartney said of Epstein: &quot; If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian &quot;.

[ Spitz 2005 255 ] Eventually the family moved to a larger home at 27 Anfield Road, Liverpool (now a Beatles-themed hotel called Epstein House). After Harry and his brother Leslie had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded &quot; I.

[ Spitz 2005 259 ] After returning to Liverpool Epstein was put in charge of Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake, and in 1955 was made a director of NEMS. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend, but after being there for only one day, he was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. As he did not want his parents to find out, he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool. [ Spitz 2005 261 ] Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.

His RADA classmates included actors Susannah York, Albert Finney and Peter O&apos;Toole, but Epstein dropped out after the third term, saying that he had become &quot; too much of a businessman to enjoy being a student, and I didn&apos;t like being a student at all. &quot; [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 11.00) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] In 1964, he revealed that he would have liked to produce a theatre play, or even act, &quot; in something by Chekov &quot;, or a &quot; straight drama &quot; by John Osborne. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 27.19) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] Back in Liverpool, his father put his son in charge of the record department of the newly-opened NEMS music store on Great Charlotte Street. [ Spitz 2005 263 ] Epstein worked &quot; day and night &quot; at the store to make it a success, and it became one of the biggest musical retail outlets in the North of England. [ Spitz 2005 264 ] The Epsteins opened a second store at 12–14 Whitechapel, and Epstein was put in charge of the entire operation. Epstein often walked across the road to the Lewis&apos;s department store (which also had a music section) where Peter Brown was employed. He watched Brown&apos;s sales technique and was impressed enough to lure Brown to work for NEMS with the offer of a higher salary and a commission on sales. [ Brown Gaines 2002 63 ] On 3  August 1961, Epstein started a regular music column in the Mersey Beat magazine, called &apos;Record Releases by Brian Epstein of NEMS&apos;. [ Spitz 2005 257 ] [ The Beatles ] { Cavern Club (photo by David Steen) } The Beatles&apos; name was supposedly first noticed by Epstein in issues of &apos;&apos;Mersey Beat&apos;&apos;, and on numerous posters around Liverpool, before he asked Bill Harry who they were, as Harry had previously convinced Epstein to sell the magazine at NEMS. [ Miles 1997 84 ] (The Beatles were featured on the front page of its second issue). [ Spitz 2005 264–265 ] [ Miles 1997 88 ] The Beatles had recorded the &quot; My Bonnie &quot; single with Tony Sheridan in Germany, and some months after its release Epstein asked Alistair Taylor about it in NEMS. [ Spitz 2005 265 ] Epstein&apos;s version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked him for the &quot; My Bonnie &quot; single, which made Epstein curious about the group. [ Miles 1997 84–85 ] Taylor later claimed that he had used the name of Jones (a regular customer) to order the single and paid the deposit himself, knowing that Epstein would notice it, and order further copies. [ http://www.liddypool.com/alistair.htm Alistair Taylor - Hello Goodbye Liddypool 18 October 2008 ] Harry and McCartney later repudiated Epstein&apos;s story, as Harry had been talking to Epstein about The Beatles for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in the Mersey Beat magazine) with McCartney saying, &quot; Brian [Epstein] knew perfectly well who The Beatles were—they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat &quot;. [ http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/birth/birth5.shtml The Birth of Mersey Beat (p5) Bill Harry/Mersey Beat Ltd. 12 June 2009 ] The Beatles were due to perform a lunchtime concert in the Cavern Club on 9  November 1961.

[ Brocken 2010 73 ] Epstein asked Harry to arrange for Epstein and his assistant Taylor to watch The Beatles perform, so Epstein and Taylor were allowed into the club without queuing, with a welcome message being announced over the club&apos;s public-address system by Bob Wooler, who was the resident DJ. [ Spitz 2005 266–268 ] Epstein later talked about the performance: [ &quot; I was immediately struck by their music, their beat, and their sense of humour on stage — and, even afterwards, when I met them, I was struck again by their personal charm. And it was there that, really, it all started &quot;. ] After the performance, Epstein and Taylor went into the dressing room (which he later called &quot; as big as a broom cupboard &quot; ), to talk to the group. { ”The Beatles Anthology” DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:57:59) Epstein talking about his first meeting with The Beatles. } The Beatles, all regular NEMS customers, immediately recognised Epstein, but before he could congratulate them on their performance, George Harrison said, &quot; And what brings Mr. Epstein here? &quot; Epstein replied with, &quot; We just popped in to say hello. I enjoyed your performance &quot;. He introduced Taylor, who merely nodded a greeting, and then said, &quot; Well done, then, goodbye &quot;, and left. [ Spitz 2005 268–269 ] Epstein and Taylor went to Peacock&apos;s restaurant in Hackins Hey for lunch, and during the meal Epstein asked Taylor what he thought about the group. Taylor replied that he honestly thought they were &quot; absolutely awful &quot;, but there was something &quot; remarkable &quot; about them. Epstein waited a long time before saying anything further, just sitting there smiling slightly, but eventually saying, &quot; I think they&apos;re tremendous! &quot; Later, when Epstein was paying the bill, he grabbed Taylor&apos;s arm and said, &quot; Do you think I should manage them? &quot; [ Spitz 2005 269 ] The Beatles played at The Cavern over the next three weeks, and Epstein was always there to watch them. He contacted Allan Williams (their previous promoter/manager) to confirm that Williams no longer had any ties to them, but Williams advised Epstein &quot; not to touch them with a barge pole &quot;, because of a Hamburg concert percentage the group had refused to pay him.

[ Miles 1997 85 ] John Lennon, Harrison and Pete Best arrived late for the 4 p.m. meeting — they had been drinking at the Grapes pub in Matthew Street — but McCartney was not with them, because, as Harrison explained, he had just got up and was &quot; taking a bath &quot;. Epstein was upset at this, but was placated by Harrison jokingly saying, &quot; He may be late, but he&apos;ll be very clean. &quot; [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 06.45) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] Lennon had invited Wooler to be at the meeting so he could later give his opinion of Epstein, but introduced Wooler by saying, &quot; This is me dad &quot;. [ Spitz 2005 272 ] Epstein was reticent throughout the short meeting, only asking if they had a manager, to which they replied in the negative, and culminating with, &quot; It seems to me that with everything going on, someone ought to be looking after you &quot;. [ Spitz 2005 273 ] Epstein had further meetings with the group on 6  December and 10  December 1961. [ Miles 1998 41 ] On 13  December 1961, at Epstein&apos;s invitation, Mike Smith of Decca records travelled from London to Liverpool to watch the group at the Cavern Club, which led to an audition in London on 1  January 1962 (see The Decca Audition ). [ Miles 1998 41 ] Being under the age of 21, McCartney, Harrison and Best had to have the legal consent of their parents to enter into a contract. Best and his mother ( Mona Best, owner of The Casbah Coffee Club ) were impressed with Epstein professional image, because of his office, expensive watch, suits and large car, as were the other Beatles, and Best’s mother thought Epstein &quot; could be good for them [The Beatles] &quot;. [ Spitz 2005 273–274 ] McCartney&apos;s father was sceptical about a Jewish manager, and warned his son to be careful about finances. { The Beatles et al. (2000) p.  65 } Lennon&apos;s guardian, Mimi Smith, refused at first, believing that Epstein had enough money to drop the group after a few months when something else came along that interested him, but as Lennon had just turned twenty-one, his Aunt&apos;s advice could be ignored. [ Spitz 2005 274 ] The Beatles finally signed a five-year contract with Epstein on 24  January 1962, [ Miles 1997 88 ] which gave Epstein 25 per cent of their gross income. The Beatles would then share any income after various expenses had been deducted. [ Miles 1998 41 ] Epstein then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises, telling his parents that managing The Beatles was only a part-time occupation, and would never interfere with the family business. [ http://www.brianepstein.com/brian.html Mr. Brian Epstein Springtime! 16 May 2011 ] The Beatles signed Epstein&apos;s first management contract, but Epstein did not sign it himself, although English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of part performance.

[ http://www.brianepstein.com/brian.html Mr. Brian Epstein Springtime! 26 May 2011 ] The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25% per cent of their gross income, after a certain financial threshold had been reached. [ Miles 1997 144–145 ] The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed out that he had been paying their expenses for months, without receiving anything in return. [ Lennon 2005 103 ] On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of &quot; Love Me Do &quot;, Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS publishing contract. [ Perry 2009 10 ] [ Lewisohn 2006 61 ] [ Appearance on stage ] Although Epstein had had no prior experience of artist management, he had a strong influence on their early dress-code and attitude on stage. When Epstein discovered the band, they wore blue jeans and leather jackets, performing at rowdy rock &apos;n&apos; roll shows where they would stop and start songs when they felt like it, or when an audience member requested a certain song. Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties; insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking or eating on stage; and also suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances. [ Spitz 2005 279–280 ] McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein&apos;s ideas, believing it was, in part, due to Epstein&apos;s RADA training. [ Miles 1997 96 ] Epstein explained that the process from leather and jeans to suits was a slower process: &quot; I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn&apos;t allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits. &quot; [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 04.58) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] The collarless suits the group started wearing were of German design (they had seen them in Hamburg), [ http://www.beatlesuits.com/Beatlesuits_Collarless.htm The &quot; Collarless &quot; Suit Beatles Suits 2 July 2011 ] which Epstein approved of, saying: &quot; I thought it was an excellent design at the time. &quot; [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 05.32) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] Lennon was against the idea of wearing suits and ties, but later said, &quot; I&apos;ll wear a suit. I&apos;ll wear a bloody balloon if somebody&apos;s going to pay me &quot;. [ Glenn Frankel http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082101714_4.html Nowhere Man (p4) The Washington Post 26 August 2007 26 May 2011 ] Epstein began seeking publicity by &quot; charming and smarming... the newspaper people &quot;, as Lennon said in 1972. { The Beatles et al. (2000) p.  66 } According to McCartney, &quot; The gigs went up in stature and though the pay went up only a little bit, it did go up &quot;, and that the band was &quot; now playing better places &quot;. { The Beatles et al. (2000) p.  67 } Another improvement Epstein made was that the group was now far more organised, having a single concert diary in which to record bookings, rather than using whoever&apos;s diary was to hand. Although usually calling him Mr Epstein, or Brian, in interviews, the group abbreviated his name to &quot; Eppy &quot; or &quot; Bri &quot; in private, which they did for anyone connected to them that were considered friends. [ Barrow 2006 31 ] [ Record contract ] { Mersey Beat &apos;&apos; newspaper in Liverpool to announce that he had secured The Beatles their first recording contract } Epstein made numerous trips to London to visit record companies with the hope of securing a record contract, but was rejected by many, including Columbia, Pye, Philips, Oriole, and most famously, Decca (see The Decca audition ). [ Miles 1997 89 ] The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan (ex-drummer of the Shadows ) to produce the studio recordings. [ Miles 1997 89 ] While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he also approached an EMI marketing executive, Ron White, who later contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor, Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record the group. [ Coleman 1989 88–89 ] White could not contact EMI&apos;s fourth staff producer, George Martin, as he was on holiday. [ Coleman 1989 93–94 ] The Decca audition was recorded on 1 January 1962. Decca informed Epstein about one month later of the rejection. As Epstein had paid for the Decca recording tapes he now had something tangible to present to recording companies. On 8 May 1962, he visited the HMV store (owned by EMI) at 363 Oxford Street, London, to have the Decca audition tape transferred to 78 rpm acetates. An HMV disc-cutter named Jim Foy liked the recordings, and suggested that Epstein should immediately contact Sid Coleman, the head of EMI&apos;s record publishing company, Ardmore &amp; Beechwood, who occupied offices on the top floor. Coleman liked the recordings, and sent Epstein to Martin, the A &amp; R manager of Parlophone. [ Hill 2007 17 ] The next day, on 9 May 1962, Epstein met Martin at EMI&apos;s Abbey Road Studios. Martin had little experience of recording rock groups and had no intention of signing The Beatles on hearing the recordings, not appreciating what others heard. Only when Martin learned, through an EMI salesman, that Epstein would cancel all his substantial NEMS business with EMI unless a single was released by The Beatles was a recording contract offered. At the eleventh hour Epstein used his economic wild card. { &quot; Schultheiss Day in the Life p32 &quot; } Martin later explained it very differently in that Epstein&apos;s enthusiasm, and his conviction that The Beatles would one day become internationally famous, convinced him to sign them. Martin also said later that EMI had &quot; nothing to lose &quot; by signing a contract with The Beatles, which gives credence to the economic leverage Epstein held over EMI. [ http://www.beatlemoney.com/martingeneral.htm George Martin and money beatlemoney.com 26 May 2011 ] Upon signing the recording contract Epstein immediately sent a telegram to The Beatles in Hamburg and Harry of the Mersey Beat music paper in Liverpool. The Beatles were confined to EMI&apos;s small Parlophone label; a label with little experience of pop or rock artists, after the group had been rejected by almost every other British record company, and without Martin ever having heard the group play live. [ Miles 1997 90 ] The Beatles&apos; recording contract that EMI offered Epstein gave them one penny for each record sold, which was split among the four members, meaning one farthing per group member. The royalty rate was further reduced for singles sold outside the UK, on which the group received half of one penny (again split between the whole band) per single. [ Brown Gaines 2002 79 ] Martin scheduled 6 June 1962 at Abbey Road Studios for the first recording session. Epstein renegotiated EMI&apos;s royalty rate, and on 27 January 1967, The Beatles signed a new nine-year contract with EMI, but with a clause stating that 25 per cent would be paid to NEMS for the full nine years, even if The Beatles decided not to renew their management contract with Epstein, which was up for renewal later that year. [ Flippo 1988 244 ] [ The Dismissal of Pete Best ] After the first recording session on 6 June 1962, Martin had one reservation. He felt the recording would be better served by an experienced studio session drummer in place of Best, as was common practice at the time. [ Miles 1997 90 ] When the news came that Martin wanted to replace Best on their recordings with a session drummer, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison asked Epstein to dismiss Best. Epstein agonised about the decision, asking The Cavern&apos;s DJ, Bob Wooler, if it was a good idea, to which Wooler replied that Best was &quot; very popular with the fans &quot; and they would not like it at all. [ Spitz 2005 329 ] Epstein finally gave in, dismissing Best on 16 August 1962, over two and half months after the first recording session at EMI studios. No reason for the dismissal was ever given to Best. [ Spitz 2005 329 ] The vacant position was initially offered by Epstein to Johnny Hutchinson, of The Big Three, whom Epstein later managed. Hutchinson turned down the job, saying, &quot; Pete Best is a very good friend of mine. I couldn&apos;t do the dirty on him &quot;, although Hutchinson played for The Beatles at short notice when Best did not turn up on the evening of his dismissal, and also two subsequent bookings, until Ringo Starr could join. [ http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/petebest3.shtml Bill Harry on Pete Best&apos;s Sacking Triumphpc.com 2011-10-22 ] Starr was well known to the group members, playing with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes as resident band at Butlins holiday complex at Skegness. Starr had previously been a temporary replacement for The Beatles and had played at a recording session with the group in Hamburg. [ Miles 1997 90 ] [ After Candlestick Park ] { The Beatles&apos; hectic schedule of touring, television, and film work between 1963–65 kept Epstein very busy. Their last live concert was at } { Candlestick Park in } { San Francisco on 29 August 1966, and Epstein&apos;s management duties then changed to reflect the changing nature of their career. He wanted them to continue touring, but they adamantly refused. } [ Spitz 2005 266 ] [ Business dealings ] { Epstein (standing) with some of his NEMS artists (Lennon, Starr, Harrison and McCartney are on the far left). } Epstein once offered the individual Beatles a fixed wage of £50-a-week for life, instead of receiving money from record sales. Harrison remembered that he was earning £25 a week at the time—which was more than the £10 a week his father was earning—but the group declined Epstein&apos;s offer, as they thought that they were worth much more than £50-a-week.

[ Brown Gaines 2002 102 ] NEMS had a staff of 25 at the time of its move from Liverpool to London in 1964.

[ Brown Gaines 2002 110 ] Epstein also successfully managed Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas (who had three hits with Lennon-McCartney songs) the Fourmost (their first two singles were written by Lennon) the Cyrkle (Epstein&apos;s first American group) and Cilla Black (who was Epstein&apos;s only female artist) as well as Tommy Quickly, and Sounds Incorporated (later known as Sounds Inc.).

Epstein revealed that even though he was entitled to be reimbursed by acts for expenses incurred, he paid for his own flights to and from the US, as he did not see himself as being part of a touring group, [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 01.48) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] and that photographs, transport, and international telephone calls were paid from his own 25 per cent share in profits. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 02.29) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] The Beatles toured the Philippines in July 1966, playing two shows at the Rizal Memorial Football Stadium in Manilla, [ http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/News/day-in-music-0704-2011/ This Day in Music: July 4th This Day in Music 7 April 2011 4 July 2011 ] but Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation&apos;s first lady, Imelda Marcos, when presented with an invitation to a breakfast party. [ Spitz 2005 619 ] Epstein politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had been their policy never to accept such official invitations. [ Spitz 2005 620 ] The Beatles and their entourage were ejected from their hotel the same day and were given a police escort to the airport, even though Epstein made a televised statement publicly apologising for the misunderstanding, which was not heard because of static. They boarded the plane to fly home, but Epstein and Beatles&apos; assistant, Mal Evans, were ordered off, with both believing they would not be allowed back on the plane. [ Spitz 2005 624 ] Epstein was forced to give the tax authorities £6,800 worth of Philippine peso notes from the Manila shows, and had to sign the tax bond verifying the exchange before being allowed back on the plane. [ Spitz 2005 625 ] Epstein added the Vic Lewis Organisation under the control of NEMS in 1966, and later brought impresario Robert Stigwood in as a manager. He offered to sell the control of NEMS to Stigwood, but did not tell any of the group about the decision. [ Spitz 2005 725–726 ] McCartney had been taking a much more active interest in NEMS&apos; finances, as the group were becoming aware that some artists with more ruthless managers—such as the Rolling Stones under Allen Klein —claimed to be receiving more commercially advantageous terms. After Epstein&apos;s death his brother, Clive, took over the control of NEMS; being the second largest shareholder of the company. [ Epstein death query Ottawa Citizen 3 29 August 1967 ] Stigwood then tried to take over the management of NEMS, but all four Beatles vehemently opposed him, with Lennon saying, &quot; We don&apos;t know you. Why would we do this? &quot; [ Spitz 2005 725–726 ] McCartney admitted that they signed all the contracts Epstein presented to them without reading them first, but when Lennon was asked for a comment about Epstein&apos;s business dealings after Epstein’s death, he said, &quot; Well, he was alright. I&apos;ve found out since, of course, that he wasn&apos;t quite as honest to us as he made out &quot;. Many other interviews with Lennon report him as being very loyal to Epstein, however, even saying, &quot; We had complete faith in him when he was running us. To us, he was the expert &quot;. [ Miles 1997 146 ] [ McCabe Schonfeld 1984 90 ] When asked, in 1964, about his own standing as a manager or businessman, Epstein replied, &quot; Fair, as a businessman, fair. I&apos;ve got a business background, and probably, a reasonable business brain. I&apos;m no, sort of, genius [laughter]. &quot; Asked about his defects, Epstein said, &quot; I&apos;m probably too conscious of ideas, rather than finance behind ideas. &quot; [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 28.16) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] [ Merchandising ] [ Seltaeb ] Before The Beatles achieved nationwide success in Britain, Epstein had permitted a company (run by his cousins that catered initially to fan club members) { Mojo Magazine (2002). Special Limited Edition # M-04951, p.  100 } to produce Beatles&apos; sweaters for 30 shillings and badges for 6 pence, eventually selling 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as The Beatles&apos; popularity grew. [ Coleman 1989 35 ] When Beatlemania stormed the UK in November 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies wanting to use The Beatles&apos; name on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and other merchandise. Epstein was adamant that The Beatles would not directly endorse any product, but through NEMS Enterprises he would grant discretionary licences to companies who were able to produce a quality product at a fair price, although many companies were already selling products without a licence. [ Spitz 2005 465 ] During the first Beatles&apos; flight to America, Epstein was offered numerous samples of products by merchandisers, including clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games, but Epstein rejected all of them. David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, had already given away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to Nicky Byrne in England, which later turned out to be a financial disaster, as that left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and The Beatles. [ Spitz 2005 465–466 ] Byrne took over Epstein&apos;s Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards) in the US. While The Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from merchandisers, promoters, television commentators, and hustlers—all demanding to talk to him. [ Spitz 2005 468–464 ] Mindful of the number of records the group was selling in America, Capitol Records sent a well-spoken Yorkshire woman, Wendy Hanson, to the Plaza hotel to act as Epstein&apos;s secretary, and to filter his calls. [ Spitz 2005 464–465 ] Hanson later worked solely with Epstein in his Albemarle Street office in London, which was separate from the NEMS office. [ Spitz 2005 667 ] Lennon later said: &quot; On the business end he [Epstein] ripped us off on the Seltaeb thing &quot;. [ McCabe Schonfeld 1984 91 ] McCartney said years later: &quot; He [Epstein] looked to his dad for business advice, and his dad knew how to run a furniture store in Liverpool &quot;. [ John Robinson http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/nov/22/popandrock.thebeatles Get Back and other setbacks The Guardian 2 November 2003 26 May 2011 London ] [ Lenmac ] Epstein asked chartered accountant James Trevor Isherwood to set up a company to collect Lennon and McCartney&apos;s PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12  May 1964. When he first visited Epstein&apos;s office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not what he thought was the usual 10 per cent other managers received at that time. [ Miles 1997 144 ] All of Epstein&apos;s expenses were also deducted from any of his artists&apos; gross income, which meant office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. [ Miles 1997 145 ] Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would reduce his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and would also mean a larger drop in NEMS income, as The Beatles&apos; concert fees would be taken out of the equation. [ Miles 1997 405 ] [ Publishing ] [ Northern Songs ] The Beatles entered into a publishing agreement with Dick James Music (DJM) who set up a company called Northern Songs. Epstein agreed that James should receive 25 per cent of the shares, and Charles Silver, his financial partner and accountant, should also receive 25%. Lennon and McCartney received 20 per cent each, and Epstein held the remaining 10 per cent. [ Miles 1997 147 ] The Beatles&apos; PRS income increased rapidly, and Epstein asked Isherwood to work out a way of avoiding the tax that Lennon and McCartney would have to pay. Isherwood suggested a Stock-market flotation for Northern Songs, and further advised Epstein that Lennon and McCartney should move to houses near his [Isherwood&apos;s] in Esher during the flotation, which Lennon, Harrison, and Starr did. Only Epstein and McCartney remained in London. [ Miles 1997 166–167 ] [ Promoter and presenter ] After moving to London, Epstein rented an office in Monmouth Street in 1965, and later bought the lease of the Saville Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. [ http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/SavilleTheatre.htm Saville Theatre History Arthur Lloyd 26 May 2011 ] [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/27/newsid_3767000/3767499.stm 1967: Beatles&apos; manager Epstein dies BBC 2 July 2011 27 August 1967 ] He promoted new works by writers such as Arnold Wesker in productions that occasionally fell foul of the Lord Chamberlain by including &quot; obscene &quot; content or nudity. Epstein changed the programme to that of a music venue in 1966, presenting various US acts. [ Spitz 2005 648–649 ] On 20 February 1967, Epstein sacked the manager of the theatre, one Michael Bullock, for lowering the safety curtain shortly before the end of a Chuck Berry concert the previous day, which Epstein had been watching with Lennon and Starr. Two fans climbed on stage to dance, the curtain came down and they were pushed from the stage. Although Bullock had not given the order, he was held responsible. [ Epstein sacks for ringing down the curtain on pop singer The Glasgow Herald 22 21 February 1967 ] Epstein was asked to appear on several music-based TV programmes in Britain after the success of The Beatles, and also hosted a regular part of the US TV show Hullabaloo, by filming his appearances in the UK. [ Personal life ] { Throughout Epstein&apos;s life he was known to be kind and caring to his family, friends of his family, and business colleagues. When Lennon married } { Cynthia Powell, on 23  August 1962, Epstein attended the wedding as the best man and paid for their celebration lunch afterwards. } [ Spitz 2005 348 ] [ Brown Gaines 2002 83 ] { During Cynthia&apos;s pregnancy, Epstein paid for a private room in a hospital and offered the Lennons the sole use of his flat on Falkner Street when they needed somewhere to live.

[ Glenn Frankel http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082101714_2.html Nowhere Man (p2) The Washington Post 26 August 2007 26 May 2011 ] When Epstein first saw The Beatles perform he noticed their stage attire first, saying: &quot; They were rather scruffily dressed, in the nicest possible way, or I should say in the most attractive way: black leather jackets, jeans, long hair of course. &quot; [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/mersey/5184.shtml Frankly Speaking : Brian Epstein (time: 04.07) BBC 23 March 1964 2 July 2011 ] McCartney said that when Epstein started to manage The Beatles, they knew that Epstein was homosexual, but did not care, because Epstein encouraged them professionally and offered them access to previously off-limits social circles. [ Miles 1997 88 ] Although Lennon often made sarcastic comments about Epstein&apos;s homosexuality to friends and to Epstein personally, nobody outside their closed circle was allowed to comment on it. Ian Sharp, one of Lennon&apos;s art school friends, once made a sarcastic remark about Epstein, saying, &quot; Which one of you [The Beatles] does he fancy? &quot; Sharp was sent a letter by Epstein&apos;s office within 48 hours that demanded a complete apology. Sharp apologised but was then completely ostracised, and was told by McCartney in a letter to have no contact at all with any of them in the future. [ Spitz 2005 302–303 ] Epstein used to go on holiday to places such as Amsterdam and Barcelona, or Manchester at weekends, as the attitude to homosexuals was not as unforgiving as in Liverpool, although there were several gay bar s in Liverpool. In his biography, Best claims that Epstein drove them both to Blackpool one evening, and Epstein declared to Best his &quot; very fond admiration &quot; for him. Epstein is then supposed to have said, &quot; Would you find it embarrassing if I ask you to stay in a hotel overnight? &quot; Best replied that he was not interested, and the two never mentioned it again. There were rumours of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein when they both went on a four-day holiday together to Barcelona in April 1963. Lennon always denied the claims, telling Playboy in 1980: &quot; It was never consummated, but we had a pretty intense relationship &quot;. Lennon&apos;s first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon&apos;s relationship with Epstein was platonic. [ Lennon 2005 104 ] A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday was portrayed in the 1991 film The Hours and Times. { Dowling, William J. (1989) Beatlesongs. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. ISBN 0-671-68229-6 } In October 1964, Epstein&apos;s autobiography, A Cellarful of Noise, was published in the UK and later in the US. It was ghost-written by journalist Derek Taylor, who had served as Epstein&apos;s assistant that year, then later as the publicist for NEMS from 1968–1970. (Lennon reportedly once quipped that the memoir should have been titled A Cellarful of Boys.) [ Cross 2004 255 ] Male homosexual activity was illegal in England and Wales until September 1967 (one month after Epstein&apos;s death) when it was decriminalised.

He explained his use of the drug as the only way of staying awake at night during numerous concert tours. } [ Spitz 2005 301–302 ] { In 1964, Brown started to notice that Epstein was taking too many pills, because Epstein often had a cough at parties, which Brown knew was Epstein&apos;s way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing. } [ Spitz 2005 518 ] { McCartney often met Epstein at late-night clubs in London, and remembered that Epstein would often } { grind his jaws, once saying, &quot; Ugghhh, the pills &quot; to McCartney. } [ Miles 1997 131 ] In 1964, after having been introduced to cannabis by Bob Dylan in New York, McCartney remembered Epstein standing in front of a mirror, pointing at himself and repeatedly saying &quot; Jew! &quot;, and laughing loudly, which McCartney found hilarious and &quot; very liberating &quot;. [ Miles 1997 188–189 ] Epstein later became heavily involved in the 1960s drug scene, and during the four months when the Sgt. Pepper album was being recorded, Epstein spent his time on holiday, or at the Priory Clinic in Putney, where he tried unsuccessfully to curb his drug use. He left the Priory for the party to launch Sgt. Pepper to selected journalists at his house at 24  Chapel Street, but went straight back to the Priory afterwards.

The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma and was signed by 65  people, including The Beatles, Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing, 16  doctors, and two members of parliament.

I am not addicted to either, but I have been very drunk and very &apos;high&apos;. &quot; After McCartney&apos;s admission on 19  June  1967, of his use of LSD, Epstein defended McCartney to the media, admitting that he had also taken it himself.

[ Miles 1997 404–405 ] Epstein made his last visit to a Beatles&apos; recording session on 23 August 1967, at the Chappell Recording Studios on Maddox Street, London. [ Miles 1997 355 ] On 24 August, Epstein asked Brown and Geoffrey Ellis down to Kingsley Hill (approximately 50 miles from his home in Chapel Street) which was Epstein&apos;s country home in Warbleton, East Sussex, for the Bank Holiday weekend. After they got there, Epstein decided to drive back to London by himself because an expected group of rent boys he had invited failed to arrive, although they did turn up after Epstein left. [ Miles 1997 405 ] Epstein phoned Brown the next day at 5 o&apos;clock in the afternoon from his Chapel Street house in London. Brown thought that Epstein sounded &quot; very groggy &quot;, and suggested that Epstein take a train back down to the nearest train station, in Uckfield, instead of driving under the influence of Tuinal s. Epstein replied that he would eat something, read his mail and watch Juke Box Jury before phoning Brown to tell him which train to meet. He never called again. [ Miles 1997 405 ] Epstein died of an overdose of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate, or sleeping pill, [ Miles 1997 405 ] in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and hearing no response, he asked the housekeeper to call the police. [ Brian Epstein Dies At His Home The Glasgow Herald 1 28 August 1967 ] Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pajamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed close by. At the statutory inquest, his death was officially ruled as accidental, and was probably caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, mixed with alcohol. [ Brian Epstein died from &quot; incautious overdose &quot; of drug, says Coroner The Glasgow Herald 1 9 September 1967 ] It was revealed that he had taken six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably usual, but meant that his tolerance was very close to becoming lethal.

Brown wrote in his memoir, The Love You Make: An Insider&apos;s Story of The Beatles, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and spoke with him directly about it. According to Brown, the note read in part, &quot; This is all too much and I can&apos;t take it anymore &quot;. Brown had also found a will, in which Epstein left his house and money to his mother and his brother (Brown himself being a small beneficiary). When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he was grateful Brown had not told anyone, and said that he was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that he had simply taken one pill too many and that he had not intended to overdose; promising to be more careful from then on. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he was really doing Epstein a favour by not showing the note to Epstein&apos;s doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. [ Brown Gaines 2002 199–200 ] The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein&apos;s death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, ruling it an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein&apos;s blood was a &quot; low fatal level &quot;. [ The Times Epstein Death Accidental 9 September 1967 ] The Beatles did not attend Epstein&apos;s funeral, wishing to give his family privacy by not attracting the media and fans. Epstein was buried in section A grave H12, in the Long Lane Jewish Cemetery, Aintree, Liverpool.
