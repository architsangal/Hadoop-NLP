[ the period of time in British history The Protectorate ] [ April 2010 April 2012 ] In history, the term protectorate has two different meanings. In its earliest inception, which has been adopted by modern international law, it is an autonomous territory that is protected diplomatically or militarily against third parties by a stronger state or entity. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. However, it retains formal sovereignty, and remains a state under international law. A territory subject to this type of arrangement is also known as a protected state. A second meaning came about as a result of European colonial expansion in the nineteenth century. Many colonized territories (mentioned on this page) came to be referred to as &quot; colonial protectorates &quot;, but were not regarded as separate states under international law. { http://books.google.com/books?id=b6LkdpfRNZgC &amp; pg=PA473 &amp; dq=protectorate+international+law &amp; hl=en &amp; ei=yzFjTOOOIsL98Abg4sXwCQ &amp; sa=X &amp; oi=book_result &amp; ct=result &amp; resnum=5 &amp; ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage &amp; q=protectorate%20international%20law &amp; f=false } Entities referred to as &quot; international protectorates &quot; can become so subordinated to the protecting power that in effect they lose their independent statehood, though there are exceptions. { http://books.google.com/books?id=jrTsNTzcY7EC &amp; pg=PA51 &amp; dq=protectorate+international+law &amp; hl=en &amp; ei=yzFjTOOOIsL98Abg4sXwCQ &amp; sa=X &amp; oi=book_result &amp; ct=result &amp; resnum=2 &amp; ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage &amp; q=protectorate%20international%20law &amp; f=false } [ Rationale ] [ Amical protection ] In amical protection, the terms are often very favorable for the protectorate. The political interest of the protector is often moral (a matter of image, prestige, ideology, internal popularity, dynastic, historical or ethno-cultural ties, etc.) or countering a rival or enemy power (e.g., preventing the rival from obtaining or maintaining control of areas of strategic importance). This may involve a very weak protectorate surrendering control of its external relations; this, however, may not constitute any real sacrifice, as the protectorate may not have been able to have similar use of them without the protector&apos;s strength. Amical protection was frequently extended by the great power s to other Christian (generally European) states and to smaller states that had no significant importance [ November 2011 ]. In the post-1815 period, non-Christian states (such as China&apos;s Qing dynasty ) also provided amical protection towards other much weaker states. [ Colonial protection ] Conditions are generally much less generous for areas of colonial protection. The protectorate was often reduced to a de facto condition similar to a colony, but using the pre-existing native state as an agent of indirect rule. Occasionally, a protectorate was established by or exercised by the other form of indirect rule: a chartered company, which becomes a de facto state in its European home state (but geographically overseas), allowed to be an independent country which has its own foreign policy and generally its own armed forces. In fact, protectorates were declared despite not being duly entered into by the traditional states supposedly being protected, or only by a party of dubious authority in those states. Colonial protectors frequently decided to reshuffle several protectorates into a new, artificial unit without consulting the protectorates, a logic disrespectful of the theoretical duty of a protector to help maintain its protectorates&apos; status and integrity. The Berlin agreement of February 26, 1885 stipulated that the colonial powers could declare in Black Africa protectorates (the last region to be divided among them) that could be established by diplomatic notification, even without actual possession on the ground. A similar case is the formal use of such terms as colony and protectorate for an amalgamation, convenient only for the colonizer or protector, of adjacent territories over which it held (de facto) sway by protective or &quot; raw &quot; colonial logic. [ Foreign relations ] In practice, a protectorate often has direct foreign relations only with the protecting power, so other states must deal with it by approaching the protector. Similarly, the protectorate rarely takes military action on its own, but relies on the protector for its defence. This is distinct from annexation, in that the protector has no formal power to control the internal affairs of the protectorate. Protectorates differ from League of Nations Mandate s and their successors, United Nations Trust Territories, whose administration is supervised, in varying degrees, by the international community. A protectorate formally enters into the protection through a bilateral agreement with the protector, while international mandates are stewarded by the world community-representing body, with or without a de facto administering power. [ Belgian ] [ Ruanda-Urundi ] During the East African Campaign of World War I, the north-west part of German East Africa, Ruanda-Urundi, was invaded by Belgian and Congolese troops in 1916 and was still occupied by them at the end of the war in 1918. As part of the Treaty of Versailles the major part of German East Africa was handed over to British control but Ruanda-Urundi, twice the size of Belgium but only about 2% of the size of the Congo, was confirmed as a Belgian protectorate by a League of Nations Mandate in 1924, later renewed as a United Nations Trust Territory. The territory was granted independence in 1962 as the separate countries of Rwanda and Burundi, bringing the Belgian colonial empire to an end. [ British and Commonwealth protectorates ] A protectorate, in the British Empire, is a territory which is not formally annexed but in which, by treaty, grant or other lawful means, the Crown has power and jurisdiction. { The Statesman&apos;s Yearbook 1967-1968 } A protectorate differs from a &quot; protected state &quot;. A protected state is a territory under a ruler which enjoys Her Britannic Majesty &apos;s protection, over whose foreign affairs she exercises control, but in respect of whose internal affairs she does not exercise jurisdiction. When Other British protectorates followed. In 1894, Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone &apos;s government officially announced that Uganda was to become a British Protectorate, where. Most British protectorates were overseen by a Commissioner or a High Commissioner, rather than a Governor. British law makes a distinction between a protectorate and protected state. Constitutionally the two are of similar status where Britain provides controlled defence and external relations. However, a protectorate has an internal government established, while a protected state establishes a form of local internal self-government based on the already existing one. Persons connected with former British protectorates, protected states, mandated or trust territories may remain British Protected Person s if they did not acquire the nationality of the country at independence. The last British protectorate proper was the Solomon Islands, which gained independence in 1978; the last British protected state was Brunei, which gained full independence in 1984.

Almost every pre-existing state in the area later covered by French West Africa was placed under protectorate status at some point, although direct rule gradually replaced protectorate agreements. Formal ruling structures, or fictive recreations of them, were largely retained as the lowest level authority figure in the French Cercles, with leaders appointed and removed by French officials. { See the classic account on this in Robert Delavignette.

Sigave and Alo on the islands of Futuna and Alofi signed a treaty establishing a French protectorate on 16 February 1888 until annexed in 1917. [ German ] The German Empire used the word &quot; Schutzgebiet &quot;, literally protectorate, for all of its colonies until they were lost during World War I, regardless of the actual level of government control. Cases involving indirect rule included; German New Guinea Marshall Islands Nauru, various officials posted with the Head Chiefs Northern Solomon islands Samoa, formerly Western Samoa Sultanate of Witu, in Kenya German South-West Africa (later Namibia ) Rwanda, a Resident with the native Mwami (king) Urundi, a Resident with the native Mwami (king; 1908 Sultan) Besides these colonial uses, within Europe Nazi Germany established the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939–1945) in the ethnically-Czech regions of Czechoslovakia.

[ Japanese ] Korean Empire (1905–1910) [ Portuguese ] Cabinda (Portuguese Congo) (1885–1974) Portugal first claimed sovereignty over Cabinda in the February 1885 Treaty of Simulambuco, which gave Cabinda the status of a protectorate of the Portuguese Crown under the request of “the princes and governors of Cabinda”. Through the Treaty of Simulambuco in 1885 between the kings of Portugal and Cabinda&apos;s princes, a Portuguese protectorate was decreed, reserving rights to the local princes and independent of Angola.

[ Contemporary usage by the United States ] Some agencies of the United States government, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, still use the term protectorate to refer to insular area s of the United States such as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This was also the case with the Philippines and (it can be argued via the Platt Amendment ) Cuba at the end of Spanish colonial rule. However, the agency responsible for the administration of those areas, the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) within the United States Department of Interior uses only the term &quot; insular area &quot; rather than protectorate. [ Joint protectorates ] [ Condominium (international law) ] The Adriatic Republic of Ragusa (presently Dubrovnik in Croatian Dalmatia) was a joint Habsburg Austrian - Ottoman Turkish protectorate 20 August 1684 - 24 August 1798 - so exceptionally both a Catholic and a Muslim protector The United States of the Ionian Islands were a federal Septinsular Republic of seven formerly Venetian (see Provveditore ) Ionian islands ( Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, Santa Maura, Ithaca, Cerigo and Paxos ), officially under joint protectorate of the Allied Christian Powers, de facto a UK amical protectorate from 1815 to 1864. Bosnia and Herzegovina were a joint Austrian and Hungarian protectorate since 1878 which formally still belonged to the Ottoman Empire until 1908 when it was annexed by Austria-Hungary (see Bosnian crisis ).
