Emily Jones is the director. The school enrolls approximately 225 students on a [ 500 acre km2 ] -hilltop campus with classrooms, dormitories, and a dairy farm on which all of its students work before graduating. An animated GIF panaroma of part of the Putney campus. The school emphasizes academics, a work program, the arts, and physical activity. The school&apos;s curriculum is intended to teach the value of labor, art, community, ethics, and scholarship for individual growth. Most of the buildings on the school&apos;s campus were partially or completely built by Putney students and faculty, with the exception of the most recent additions, the Michael S. Currier Center and the Field House. This Currier Center is a departure from Putney&apos;s customary white, colonial-style architecture, instead using stone and concrete walls in an angular design. It is used for dance, music, movie-making and visual-art presentations. The Field House, which opened in October 2009, was designed as a &quot; net zero energy building &quot;, which means that it is expected that its net use of carbon energy over a year will equal zero. It does so by innovative design and construction features plus a field of solar panels. { The } { Boston Globe wrote: &quot; The school&apos;s combination of a New England work ethic and a strong academic program, its pioneering of coeducation and community service and its emphasis on music and the arts have made it a model for other independent schools...Putney remains committed to the total community of work and schooling that goes far beyond the more limited pieces of its tradition adopted by other schools. &quot; Cohen, Muriel. &quot; Putney - A Vermont School that Dared and Succeeded. &quot; The Boston Globe January 1, 1995: p.
