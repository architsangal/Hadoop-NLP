The spacing is such that when the vegetables are fully grown, their leaves just barely touch each other, creating a microclimate in which weed growth is suppressed and moisture is conserved.

Since the gardener does not walk on the raised beds, the soil is not compacted and the roots have an easier time growing.

Waist-high raised beds enable the elderly and handicapped to grow vegetables without having to bend-over to tend them. [ Overview ] Raised beds lend themselves to the development of complex agriculture systems that utilize many of the principles and methods of permaculture. They can be used effectively to control erosion and recycle and conserve water and nutrients by building them along contour lines on slopes. This also makes more space available for intensive crop production. They can be created over large areas with the use of several commonly available tractor-drawn implements and efficiently maintained, planted and harvested using hand tools. This form of gardening is compatible with square foot gardening and companion planting. Circular waist high raised beds with a path to the center (a slice of the circle cut out) are called keyhole gardens.

The charity Send a Cow is promoting the creation of these in Africa. [ Materials and construction ] Vegetable garden bed construction materials should be chosen carefully. Some concerns exist regarding the use of pressure-treated timber. [ http://www.finegardening.com/design/articles/pressure-treated-wood-in-beds.aspx Does Pressure-Treated Wood Belong in Your Garden? Fine Gardening Magazine March 6, 2012 Lively, Ruth ] Treated pine that was traditionally treated using chromated copper arsenate or CCA, a toxic chemical mix for preserving timber that may leach chemicals into the soil which in turn can be drawn up into the plants, a concern for vegetable growers, where part or all of the plant is eaten. If using timber to raise the garden bed, ensure that it is an untreated hardwood to prevent the risk of chemicals leaching into the soil. A common approach is to use timber sleepers joined with steel rods to hold them together. Another approach is to use concrete blocks, although less aesthetically pleasing, they are inexpensive to source and easy to use. On the market are also prefab raised garden bed solutions which are made from long lasting polyethylene that is UV stabilized and food grade so it will not leach undesirable chemicals into the soil or deteriorate in the elements. A double skinned wall provides an air pocket of insulation that minimizes the temperature fluctuations and drying out of the soil in the garden bed. Sometimes raised bed gardens are covered with clear plastic to protect the crops from wind and strong rains. Pre-manufactured raised bed gardening boxes also exist.
