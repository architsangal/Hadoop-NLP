Proby (born James Marcus Smith, November 6, 1938) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor, who has portrayed Elvis Presley and Roy Orbison in musical theater productions as well as recording career in his own right. The stage name P.J. Proby was suggested to him by his friend Sharon Sheeley, [ http://www.rockabillyhall.com/SharonSheeley1.html biography Rockabillyhall.com November 13, 2011 ] who had had a boyfriend of the same name at high school. Proby recorded the singles &quot; Hold Me &quot;, &quot; Somewhere &quot; and &quot; Maria &quot; [ http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id%3D1704 P J Proby UK Chart Stats April 04, 2012 ] (the later two songs are from the Broadway musical West Side Story ). In 2008, Proby celebrated his 70th birthday and EMI released the Best Of The EMI Years 1961-1972. The Proby of today continues to write and record music on his own independent record label Select Records as well as perform across the UK on various Sixties themed concerts. [ Youth and early career ] Proby was born in Houston, Texas, United States, and was educated at San Marcos Military Academy, Culver Naval Academy and Western Military Academy. After graduation he moved to California to become a motion picture actor and recording artist. Given the stage name Jett Powers by top Hollywood agents Gabey, Lutz, Heller and Loeb, { Rcs.law.emory.edu } [ November 2011 ] he took acting and singing lessons, and appeared in movies with small roles. Two singles, &quot; Go, Girl, Go &quot; and &quot; Loud Perfume &quot;, were released on an independent label. Proby was brought by Sharon Sheeley to audition at Liberty Records in 1961 and he recorded a number of unsuccessful singles for the label. In 1962 he began writing songs and recording demos for artists such as Elvis Presley and Bobby Vee. [ Success in Britain ] Proby travelled to London after being introduced to Jack Good by Sheeley and Jackie DeShannon. He appeared on The Beatles &apos; television special in 1964. Under the production of Good, Proby scored a string of exuberantly-styled UK top 20 hits in 1964 and 1965 including &quot; Hold Me &quot;, &quot; Together &quot; (featuring session guitarists Big Jim Sullivan and Jimmy Page ), &quot; Somewhere &quot; and &quot; Maria &quot; (the latter two taken from the musical West Side Story ). Further, of particular note to Beatles fans, Proby recorded the Lennon–McCartney composition &quot; That Means a Lot &quot;, a song The Beatles had attempted several times before deciding to give it away. Despite these hits, Proby&apos;s UK career gradually lost momentum after a number of controversial live appearances—including a notorious trouser-splitting incident at a February 1965 show in Luton—led to performance bans by the ABC theatre chain, its TV namesake and BBC TV. { Guiness Book of Rock Stars, Dafydd Rees &amp; Luke Crampton, 1991 } A run of minor hits in 1966 was followed by a number of flops, and in March 1968 &quot; It&apos;s Your Day Today &quot; gave Proby his last UK chart entry for nearly 30 years. [ Back in the U.S. ] In 1967 Proby scored his only Billboard Hot 100 Top 30 hit with &quot; Niki Hoeky &quot;. In September 1968, Proby recorded the album Three Week Hero, which was released in 1969. A collection of country -style ballad s mixed with blues, it utilised The New Yardbirds, later to become Led Zeppelin, as Proby&apos;s backing band. The album was produced by Steve Rowland. [ The London stage ] In 1971 he appeared on stage as Cassio in a rock musical version of Shakespeare &apos;s Othello, called Catch My Soul. [ http://home.online.no/~frodebye/dana_gillespie/lp_catch_my_soul.htm Home.online info Home.online.no November 13, 2011 ] After Catch My Soul, { Catch My Soul } he continued to perform mostly in cabaret and nightclub s, singing 1960s ballads and rhythm and blues material. Signing with Good again in 1977, he portrayed Elvis Presley in a theatrical production of Elvis – The Musical, winning a Best Musical of the Year award. [ Angie, Fumble http://www.fumbleontheweb.com/sites/elvis.htm Best Musical of the Year Fumbleontheweb.com November 28, 1977 November 13, 2011 ] [ August 2009 ] In 1978, Proby recorded with the Dutch rock group Focus releasing Focus con Proby. He then returned to singing in clubs, before embarking on a change of direction. In 1993 Proby appeared in the Jack Good biographical musical Good Rockin&apos; Tonite [ http://today.answers.com/topic/i-j-good Answers.com: I.J.

Two years later in 1995, Proby appeared in the Roy Orbison tribute show, Only The Lonely. By 1996 Proby was acting again in Elvis – The Musical. [ 1980s ] In 1985, Proby recorded a version of Gloria Jones &apos;s &quot; Tainted Love &quot; for the Manchester based Savoy Records label which was followed by further covers of &quot; Love Will Tear Us Apart &quot;, &quot; Anarchy in the UK &quot;, Prince song &quot; Sign of the Times &quot;, &quot; In the Air Tonight &quot;, and &quot; Garbageman &quot; for the same label. In 1987 his Savoy Records single &quot; M9700 Hardcore &quot; { Savoy Records PJS6, 1987 } credited Madonna as &quot; Second Vocal (Special Guest) &quot; though this was patently untrue. { &quot; Critial Vision &quot; edited by David Kerekes and David Slater, Critical Vision, 1995, ISBN 0-9523288-0-1, page 156 } { (London) Evening News, September 22, 1987 } { &quot; Madonna to Sue over &apos;porn&apos; Disc &quot;, Daily Mail, September 23, 1987 } In 1989, the Southport, Lancashire based author/songwriter Ron Ellis recorded Proby singing one of Ellis&apos;s compositions, &quot; Hot California Nights &quot; [ 1990s to the present ] In the early 1990s Proby was offered a recording contract by John G. Sutton from the Preston -based J&apos;Ace Records. This led to the release of a single, &quot; Stage of Fools &quot;, and an album, Thanks. It was distributed internationally by BMG. Granada TV featured Proby in a documentary around this time. Subsequently, Proby suffered a heart attack whilst on holiday in Florida in 1992 which curtailed his activities until the following year. Then he reappeared on stage as himself in the biographical musical Good Rockin&apos; Tonight, followed by playing Roy Orbison in Only The Lonely. A year later Proby returned to a new production of Elvis – The Musical, and released the album Legend. { Web.telia.com review } The album featured songwriting and production contributions from Marc Almond, and Neal X from Sigue Sigue Sputnik. A resulting single, &quot; Yesterday Has Gone &quot;, a duet with Almond, reached number 58 on the UK Singles Chart at the end of 1996.
