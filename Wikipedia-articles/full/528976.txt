Corpus luteum. 300 c_55 12260569 ] The corpus luteum ( Latin for &quot; yellow body &quot; ) (plural corpora lutea) is a temporary endocrine structure in mammals, involved in production of relatively high levels of progesterone and moderate levels of estradiol and inhibin A. It is colored as a result of concentrating carotenoid s from the diet. Corpus luteum secretes moderate amount of estrogen to inhibit further release of GnRH and thus secretion of LH and FSH. [ Development and structure ] The corpus luteum develops from an ovarian follicle during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or estrous cycle, following the release of a secondary oocyte from the follicle during ovulation. The follicle first forms a corpus hemorrhagicum before it becomes a corpus luteum, but the term refers to the visible collection of blood left after rupture of the follicle that secretes progesterone. While the oocyte (later the zygote if fertilization occurs) traverses the Fallopian tube into the uterus, the corpus luteum remains in the ovary. The corpus luteum is typically very large relative to the size of the ovary; in humans, the size of the structure ranges from under 2  cm to 5  cm in diameter.

The granulosa lutein cells do have aromatase, and use it to produce estrogens, using the androgens previously synthesized by the theca lutein cells, as the granulosa lutein cells in themselves do not have the 17α-hydroxylase or 17,20 lyase to produce androgens. { Chapter 54, The Female Reproductive System &gt; THE OVARIAN STEROIDS, in: } [ Boron WF, Boulpaep EL Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch Elsevier/Saunders 2004 1300 1-4160-2328-3 ] Once the corpus luteum regressed the remnant is known as corpus albicans. [ Function ] The corpus luteum is essential for establishing and maintaining pregnancy in females. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which is a steroid hormone responsible for the decidualization of the endometrium (its development) and maintenance, respectively. [ When egg is not fertilized ] If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum stops secreting progesterone and decays (after approximately 14 days in humans). It then degenerates into a corpus albicans, which is a mass of fibrous scar tissue. The uterine lining sloughs off without progesterone and is expelled through the vagina (in humans and some great apes, which go through a menstrual cycle ). In an estrus cycle, the lining degenerates back to normal size. [ When egg is fertilized ] If the egg is fertilized and implantation occurs, the syncytiotrophoblast (derived from trophoblast ) cells of the blastocyst secrete the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, or a similar hormone in other species) by day 9 post-fertilization. Human chorionic gonadotropin signals the corpus luteum to continue progesterone secretion, thereby maintaining the thick lining (endometrium) of the uterus and providing an area rich in blood vessel s in which the zygote (s) can develop. From this point on, the corpus luteum is called the corpus luteum graviditatis. The introduction of prostaglandin s at this point causes the degeneration of the corpus luteum and the abortion of the fetus. However, in placental animals such as humans, the placenta eventually takes over progesterone production and the corpus luteum degrades into a corpus albicans without embryo/fetus loss. [ Content of carotenoids ] The yellow color and name of the corpus luteum, like that of the macula lutea of the retina, is due to its concentration of certain carotenoid s, especially lutein. In 1968, a report indicated that beta-carotene was synthesized in laboratory conditions in slices of corpus luteum from cows. However, attempts have been made to replicate these findings, but have not succeeded. The idea is not presently accepted by the scientific community. { Brian Davis.
