Valencia was first planned in the 1960s by the Newhall Land and Farming Company. Development began in the 1960s and continues to the present day. Valencia is notable for its landscaped boulevards connecting a mix of apartment buildings, single-family detached homes, shopping centers, office parks and industrial warehouses. Major schools in Valencia include California Institute of the Arts, College of the Canyons, West Ranch High School, and Valencia High School. Valencia&apos;s residential areas are separated into villages, each with its own lifestyle (see List of Valencia, California residential villages ). Almost all of Valencia&apos;s villages are close to schools, shopping, etc. In many of the villages, homeowner association s oversee the quality and upkeep of housing developments ranging in size from a few dozen homes to over a thousand. Many villages also have a Neighborhood Watch program in force. Valencia also has an extensive system of paved pathways with grade separations over and under the boulevards. The pathways are called paseos. These paseos connect the entire community together, making it possible to travel around nearly all of Valencia on foot or by bicycle without having to cross boulevards at grade. The paseo network is connected to the Santa Clara River Trail which runs east along the Santa Clara River to Canyon Country. Landowners in the Valencia area pay special taxes to maintain landscaping and the paseo system. Recently, Valencia has emphasized its history as a planned community with the catchphrase, &quot; Built as promised. &quot; It has even gone as far as to unofficially brand itself as &quot; Awesometown, &quot; using the tagline &quot; Just Another Day in...Awesometown &quot; on the website.
