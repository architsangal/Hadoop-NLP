National referendums are seldom used in Canada. The first two referendum s saw voters in Québec and Canada take dramatically opposing stands, the third saw most of the voters take a stand dramatically opposed to that of the politicians in power.

The Liberals won a minority, and the NDP announced they would press for electoral reform through a referendum. The possibility of a national referendum on electoral reform was made more likely through the Throne speech that opened Parliament in October, 2004, in which former Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin included electoral reform in his plan for the next Parliament. So far Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper has not made any moves towards reform of the electoral system. There had been discussion regarding a national referendum over the issue of same-sex marriage, which was a highly divisive issue in Canada. A national plebiscite had been suggested by Alberta Premier Ralph Klein and some Conservatives and Liberal backbencher s. However, Paul Martin&apos;s Liberal government, with the support of the NDP and Bloc Québécois, passed the Civil Marriage Act, legalizing same-sex marriage through Parliament in July 2005 without holding a plebiscite. In December 2006, Stephen Harper &apos;s government introduced a motion to re-open the marriage debate, which lost. Notably, members of all parties, including some conservative cabinet members, voted it down. [ Provincial referendums ] [ British Columbia ] In British Columbia, a Treaty Referendum was held on First Nations treaty rights in 2002. The referendum proposed eight questions that voters were asked to either support or oppose. Critics claimed the phrasing was flawed or biased toward a predetermined response. Critics, especially First Nations and religious groups, called for a boycott of the referendum, and only about one third of ballots were returned, significantly less than the usual turnout in provincial general elections. The ballots that were returned showed enthusiastic support, with over 80 per cent of participating voters agreeing to all eight proposed principles. A referendum on electoral reform on May 17, 2005 was held in conjunction with the provincial election that year. British Columbian voters were asked to approve a new electoral system based on the Single Transferable Vote called BC STV. It passed with the support of a majority of voters (57%), but failed to meet the required &quot; supermajority &quot; threshold of 60%. Premier Gordon Campbell announced due to the large support shown for electoral reform a second referendum would be held in correspondence with the British Columbia general election, 2009. This referendum would also have required approval by 60% of those voting. The second referendum was held on May 12, 2009 in conjunction with the province election. The results were a &quot; supermajority &quot; of 60.92% voting for retaining the current &quot; first past the post &quot; electoral system and 39.8% voting for the proposed Single Transferable Vote. A mail-in referendum was held from June 13 to August 5, 2011, on the fate of the province&apos;s harmonized sales tax. The government pledged to discontinue the tax if more than 50% of the voters opt to have the tax discontinued. It was passed, with 55% in favour. [ Newfoundland and Labrador ] [ Newfoundland referendums, 1948 ] The island of Newfoundland, then a British colony, held two referendums in 1948 to determine its future. An initial referendum was held on June 3, 1948 to decide between continuing with the British appointed Commission of Government that had ruled the island since the 1930s, revert to dominion status with responsible government, or join Canadian Confederation. The result was inconclusive, with 44.6% supporting the restoration of dominion status, 41.1% for confederation with Canada, and 14.3% for continuing the Commission of Government. A second referendum on July 22, 1948, which asked Newfoundlanders to choose between confederation and dominion status, was decided by a vote of 52% to 48% for confederation with Canada. Newfoundland joined Canada on March 31, 1949. A referendum was held in Newfoundland and Labrador in 1995 that approved replacing the province&apos;s system of parochial school s with a largely public school system. In 1997, a second referendum to amend the Terms of Union to allow for the Catholic and Pentecostal school systems to be disbanded and brought into the public system. [ New Brunswick ] On May 14, 2001, New Brunswick held a referendum on whether to continue to permit Video Lottery Terminals to operate in the province. 53.1% of those who voted in favour of retaining the terminals. [ Nova Scotia ] In 2004, Nova Scotia held a non-binding plebiscite on whether to allow &apos;Sunday shopping &apos;. The result was a slight victory for the No side although the government went ahead and legalized Sunday Shopping the following year after a court decision overturned the law. [ Ontario ] On October 10, 2007 Ontario held a referendum on whether to adopt a Mixed Member Proportional system of elections. The proposed system failed with 63% voting for the status quo in favour of First-Past-the-Post. See Ontario electoral reform referendum, 2007 for more information. This was the first referendum in that province since 1924 when a referendum on prohibition was held. [ Prince Edward Island ] The small province of Prince Edward Island (under 150,000 people and therefore in scale more like a municipal government ) has had several referendums in its past, although the correct terminology in the province is a plebiscite. The last provincial plebiscite was held to determine if Islanders were in favour of a fixed link to the mainland. It passed 60% to 40%. This allowed the provincial and federal governments to attract contractors to build what is now the Confederation Bridge. On November 28, 2005, Islanders were asked to vote by plebiscite whether or not they wanted mixed member proportional representation - partly &quot; party list -based &quot; - electoral system. Islanders decided, 64% to 36%, to keep the status quo first-past-the-post based electoral system that was already in place. [ Quebec ] Four referendums were held in Quebec : 1919 - April 10: Referendum on the legalization of the sale of alcohol. The Yes side won. 1980 - May 20: Referendum on the Sovereignty-Association proposal. The No side won. 1992 - October 26: Referendum on the Charlottetown Accord. The No side won. 1995 - October 30: Referendum on Sovereignty with optional partnership offer The No side narrowly won.
