Fine, was the American co-creator of Superman (along with Joe Shuster ), the first of the great comic book superhero es and one of the most recognizable of the 20th century. He was inducted (with Shuster posthumously) into the comic book industry&apos;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1993. [ Early life ] The son of Jew ish immigrants from Lithuania, Siegel was the youngest of six children. His father Mitchell Siegel (née Mikhel Segalovich) was a sign painter who opened a haberdasher y and encouraged his son&apos;s artistic inclinations. Mitchell died of a heart attack brought on by the robbery of his store, when Jerry was in junior high school. { Last Son, a documentary film about the creation of Superman, shows Mitchell Siegel&apos;s death certificate. } [ Colton David http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-08-25-superman-creators_N.htm Superman&apos;s story: Did a fatal robbery forge the Man of Steel? USA Today August 27, 2008 February 17, 2009 http://www.webcitation.org/61KXnWoCs August 30, 2011 ] Siegel was a fan of movies, comic strip s, and especially science fiction pulp magazine s. He became active in what would become known as fandom, corresponding with other science fiction fans, including the young future author Jack Williamson. In 1929, Siegel published what might have been the first SF fanzine, Cosmic Stories, which he produced with a manual typewriter and advertised in the classified section of Science Wonder Stories. He published several other booklets over the next few years. Siegel attended Glenville High School in Cleveland, Ohio and worked for its weekly student newspaper, The Torch. He was a shy, not particularly popular student, but he achieved a bit of fame among his peers for his popular Tarzan parody, &quot; Goober the Mighty. &quot; At about age 16, while at Glenville, he befriended his later collaborator, Joe Shuster. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: [ When Joe and I first met, it was like the right chemicals coming together. ] The writer - artist team broke into comics with Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson &apos;s landmark New Fun, debuting with the musketeer swashbuckler &quot; Henri Duval &quot; and the supernatural-crimefighter strip Doctor Occult in issue #6 (Oct. 1935). [ Superman ] Siegel and Shuster created a bald telepathic villain named &quot; The Superman, &quot; bent on dominating the entire world. He appeared in the short story &quot; The Reign of the Super-Man &quot; from Science Fiction #3, a science fiction fanzine that Siegel published in 1933. [ Daniels Les Les Daniels 1998 Superman: The Complete History 1st Titan Books 1-85286-988-7 ] The character was not successful. Tossing and turning in bed one night in 1934, he came upon the more familiar version of the character. [ John Gross Superman at Fifty! The Persistence of a Legend!Edited by Dennis Dooley and Gary Engle (review), The New York Times December 15, 1987 http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9B0DE3DC1F38F936A25751C1A961948260 2007-01-29 http://www.webcitation.org/61KY8GGDe August 30, 2011 ] Siegel and Shuster then began a six-year quest to find a publisher. Titling it The Superman, Siegel and Shuster offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing, who had published a 48-page black-and-white comic book entitled Detective Dan: Secret Operative No. 48. Although the duo received an encouraging letter, Consolidated never again published comic books. Shuster took this to heart and burned all pages of the story, the cover surviving only because Siegel rescued it from the fire. Siegel and Shuster each compared this character to Slam Bradley, an adventurer the pair had created for Detective Comics #1 (March 1937). { Daniels (1998), p. 17. } In 1938, after that proposal had languished among others at More Fun Comics — published by National Allied Publications, the primary precursor of DC Comics — editor Vin Sullivan chose it as the cover feature for National&apos;s Action Comics #1 (June 1938). The following year, Siegel &amp; Shuster initiated the syndicated &apos;&apos;Superman&apos;&apos; comic strip. Siegel also created the ghostly avenger The Spectre during this same period. Siegel and Shuster&apos;s status as children of Jewish immigrants is also thought to have influenced their work. Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued that they crafted &quot; an immigrant figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American &quot;, something which Pevey feels taps into an important aspect of American identity. { Pevey, Timothy Aaron &quot; } [ &quot; From Superman to Superbland: The Man of Steel&apos;s Popular Decline Among Postmodern Youth &quot; 3.14 Mb ] {. April 10, 2007 URN: etd-04172007-133407 } In 1946, Siegel and Shuster, nearing the end of their 10-year contract to produce Superman stories, sued National over rights to the characters. In 1947, the team had rejoined editor Sullivan, by now the founder and publisher of the comic-book company Magazine Enterprises; there they created the short-lived comical crime-fighter Funnyman. Siegel went on to become comics art director for publisher Ziff-Davis in the early 1950s, and later returned to DC to write uncredited Superman stories in 1959 under the control of Silver Age Superman editor Mort Weisinger. When he sued DC over the Superman rights again in 1967, his relationship with the hero he had co-created was again severed. Siegel&apos;s later work would appear in Marvel Comics, where under the pseudonym &quot; Joe Carter &quot; he scripted the &quot; Human Torch &quot; feature in Strange Tales #112-113 (Sept.-Oct. 1963), introducing the teenaged Torch&apos;s high school girlfriend, Doris Evans; and, under his own name, a backup feature starring the X-Men member Angel, which ran in Marvel Tales and Ka-Zar. { Joe Carter at the } { Grand Comics Database } Siegel wrote as well during this time for Archie Comics, where he created campy versions of existing superheroes in Archie&apos;s Mighty Comics line; Charlton Comics, where he created a few superheroes; and even England&apos;s Lion, where he scripted The Spider. In 1968, he worked for Western Publishing, for which he wrote (along with Carl Barks ) stories in the Junior Woodchucks comic book. In 1970s, he worked for Mondadori Editore (at that time the Italian Disney comic book licensee) on its title Topolino, listed in the mastheads of the period as a scriptwriter ( &quot; soggettista e sceneggiatore &quot; ). In 1985, DC Comics named Siegel as one of the honorees in the company&apos;s 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great. [ Marx, Barry Cavalieri, Joey and Hill, Thomas Petruccio, Steven Marx, Barry Jerry Siegel A Fantasy Made Real Fifty Who Made DC Great 1985 DC Comics 8 ] Siegel was invited in 1986 by DC Comics&apos; editor Julius Schwartz to write an &quot; imaginary &quot; final story for Superman, following Marv Wolfman &apos;s Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series and before John Byrne &apos;s The Man of Steel miniseries, which reintroduced Superman. Siegel declined, and the story was instead given to writer Alan Moore, and published in September 1986 in two parts entitled &quot; Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? &quot; published in Superman #423 and Action Comics #583. In 2005, he was posthumously awarded the Bill Finger Award For Excellence in Comic Book Writing. He was inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1993. [ Legal issues ] [ Siegel &amp; amp; Shuster v. Warner Communications ] Siegel in 1975 launched a public-relations campaign to protest DC Comics&apos; treatment of Shuster and him.

Time Warner ] On April 16, 1999, Siegel&apos;s widow Joanne Siegel, and their daughter, Laura Siegel Larson, filed a copyright termination notice. Warner Bros. contested this copyright termination, making the status of Siegel&apos;s share of the copyright the subject of a legal battle. Warner Bros. and the Siegels entered into discussions on how to resolve the issues raised by the termination notice, but these discussions were set aside by the Siegels and in October 2004 they filed suit alleging copyright infringement on the part of Warner Bros. Warner Bros. countersued, alleging, among other arguments, that the termination notice contains defects.

Issues regarding the amount of monies owed Siegel&apos;s estate and whether the claim the estate has extends to derivative works such as movie versions will be settled at trial, although any compensation would only be owed from works published since 1999. { Ciepley, Michael. &quot; Ruling Gives Heirs a Share of Superman Copyright &quot; } { The New York Times, March 29, 2008.

The Siegels argued that Jerry Siegel was an independent contractor at the time he proposed the original character, which DC declined at the time. After returning from World War II, Siegel found that DC had published a Superboy story which bore similarities to his proposal.

W. Lew issued a summary judgment ruling that the Siegel heirs had the right to revoke their copyright assignment to Superboy and had successfully reclaimed the rights as of November 17, 2004. Warner Bros. and DC Comics replied that they &quot; respectfully disagree &quot; with the ruling and will seek review. Warner Bros. and DC Comics filed a motion for reconsideration of Judge Lew&apos;s ruling in January 2007.
