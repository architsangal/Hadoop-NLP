The band&apos;s original line-up featured Perry Farrell (vocals), Dave Navarro (guitar), Eric Avery (bass) and Stephen Perkins (drums). After breaking up in 1991, Jane&apos;s Addiction briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2001, both times with Avery declining to participate. In 2008, the band&apos;s &quot; classic &quot; line-up, featuring Avery, reunited and embarked on a world tour. Avery subsequently left the band in early 2010 as the group began work on new material. [ http://stereokill.net/2010/03/eric-avery-departs-janes-addiction Eric Avery departs Jane’s Addiction Andrew Lindsay StereoKill ] Jane&apos;s Addiction was one of the first bands to emerge from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. Their initial farewell tour launched the first Lollapalooza festival, an alternative rock showcase. As a result, Jane&apos;s Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the &quot; Alternative Nation. &quot; { di Perna, Alan. &quot; Brave Noise–The History of Alternative Rock Guitar &quot;. Guitar World. December 1995. } The band was ranked 35th on VH1&apos;s &quot; 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock &quot; list. [ http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm VH1: &apos;100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists&apos;: 1–50 Rock On The Net May 28, 2011 ] [ History ] [ Formation and Jane&apos;s Addiction (1985–1987) ] Jane&apos;s Addiction formed out of the remains of frontman Perry Farrell &apos;s previous band, Psi Com. In mid-1985, Farrell was searching for a new bass player for the faltering Psi-com when he was introduced to Eric Avery. Farrell and Avery bonded over a mutual appreciation for Joy Division and The Velvet Underground and began to practice together, even though Avery never did become a full-fledged member of Farrell&apos;s disintegrating group. { Mullen, Brendan. Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane&apos;s Addiction. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2005. ISBN 0-306-81347-5, p. 48 } The new band was dubbed &quot; Jane&apos;s Addiction &quot; in honor of Farrell&apos;s housemate, Jane Bainter, who was addicted to drugs. At the beginning, little known guitarist Matt Fanuka was rhythm guitar for four days, but was cut from the band because of intense methamphetamine usage. In its early incarnation, Jane&apos;s Addiction went through three guitarists and featured Matt Chaikin, formerly of Kommunity FK, on drums. { Mullen, p. 54 } After Chaikin failed to show up for several rehearsals, Farrell began seeking a new drummer. Avery&apos;s younger sister Rebecca suggested her boyfriend Stephen Perkins. Avery was uncertain because of their differing tastes in music, but eventually relented. { Mullen, p. 75–76 } After Perkins was hired, the drummer and Rebecca Avery promised to get their friend Dave Navarro into the group. Based on Perkins&apos; recommendation, the band auditioned Navarro and subsequently hired him. { Mullen, p. 77–78 } Jane&apos;s Addiction became a sensation on the Los Angeles club scene, primarily headlining at Scream [ what is &apos;Scream&apos;? April 2012 ]. The band soon gained interest from a variety of record labels. While the group had decided to sign with Warner Bros. Records, Jane&apos;s Addiction insisted on releasing its debut on independent record label Triple X Records first. { Mullen, p. 113–15 } The band&apos;s manager negotiated the largest advance up to that point, with Warner Bros. signing the band for between $250,000 to $300,000. { Mullen, p. 118 } In January 1987, the band recorded its debut record Jane&apos;s Addiction during a live performance at the Roxy Theatre at a cost of $4,000. { Mullen, p. 119–21 } Before the album was released, Jane&apos;s Addiction supported British band Love and Rockets on a two-month tour in late 1987. { Mullen, p. 158 }.Also in late 1987, the band opened for former Bauhaus vocalist Peter Murphy at the now demolished Fender&apos;s Ballroom in Long Beach. [ Nothing&apos;s Shocking (1987–1989) ] In January 1988, Jane&apos;s Addiction went into the studio to record its first studio album, Nothing&apos;s Shocking. Warner Bros. gave Jane&apos;s Addiction a list of producers to choose from, but the group chose Dave Jerden. { Mullen, p. 165 } Nothing&apos;s Shocking was released in 1988. &quot; Mountain Song &quot; was released as a single; MTV refused to air the song&apos;s music video due to a scene containing full frontal nudity. { Mullen, p. 179 } Farrell then decided to release the music video commercially with added live footage to create the Soul Kiss home video. { Mullen, p. 180 } Due to lack of airplay on MTV and modern rock radio, the album only sold 200,000 to 250,000 copies in its first year of release. { Mullen, p. 190 } After the album&apos;s release, the band went on tour, opening for Iggy Pop and The Ramones. By the end of the tour, Jane&apos;s Addiction was headlining clubs and theaters. [ Ritual de lo Habitual and first breakup (1989–1991) ] Jane&apos;s Addiction was scheduled to begin recording its next album in mid-1989. Navarro later stated he had almost no recollection of working on the album due to his addiction to heroin. { Mullen, p. 201–02 } Ritual de lo Habitual was released in 1990. To support the album, the band embarked on a 13-month tour. Farrell recalled, &quot; That thirteen-month tour behind Ritual was half the reason we wound up unable to stand one another. The other half is that I am an intolerable narcissist who can&apos;t get along with anyone. &quot; { Mullen, p. 218 } Part of the tour included headlining the first Lollapalooza festival, which travelled across North America in mid-1991. The festival, created by Perry Farrell and Marc Geiger, was to become a farewell tour for Jane&apos;s Addiction, but at the same time it was a music festival with bands such as Nine Inch Nails, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Butthole Surfers, Fishbone, The Rollins Band, The Violent Femmes, Body Count, and Ice-T. During this time Jane&apos;s Addiction began to get more exposure than they had ever before. &quot; Been Caught Stealing &quot; and &quot; Stop! &quot; became smash hit singles and received solid amounts of air time on MTV. During the very first Lollapalooza show, Perry Farrell and Dave Navarro got into a fight onstage after the two had begun violently bumping each other mid-song. The band walked off stage, but came back to play an encore; however, the fight continued and Navarro eventually threw his guitar into the crowd. Regardless, the band continued the tour and played about 25 more Lollapalooza shows, frequently playing a cover of Sly and the Family Stone &apos;s Don&apos;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey as a duet with Ice-T and Body Count as part of the set. In late 1991, Avery told Navarro that he planned on leaving the band. Navarro quickly agreed to do the same thing. The two told their management, who in turn tried to convince them to play in Japan, but Avery and Navarro only wanted to play as much as was contractually obligated. Jane&apos;s Addiction played its last shows in Australia and Hawaii before disbanding. { Mullen, p. 239–40 } According to Spin Magazine (1991 Vol. 7 Num. 3), for most of the &quot; Ritual &quot; tour, Avery and Navarro, aside from the concerts, tended to do their own thing and abstain from the regular partying that Farrell and Perkins were involved in. To not be tempted, after most shows, Avery and Navarro (and his wife at the time, Tanya) would immediately retire to the hotel. Even on the tour bus, if Avery and Navarro ever needed &quot; to retreat &quot;, they were given the back of the tour bus at any time, no questions asked. Quoted from the article: &quot;...they have simply learned that they cannot use drugs of any kind anymore without becoming slaves to them, and that slavery is death &quot;. This dichotomy was listed as one of the major determining factors involving the break-up of the band; regardless of the success, Avery and Navarro&apos;s need to abstain and their wanting to live their lives free from addiction and the slavery that comes with it had to be their top priority in life and they couldn&apos;t do that while being a part of J.A.. [ Solo projects and 1997 reunion (1992–2001) ] The band members pursued other projects in the 1990s. Farrell and Perkins formed another band, Porno for Pyros, and had some success with their two albums, Porno For Pyros (1993) and Good God&apos;s Urge (1996); meanwhile, Avery and Navarro formed Deconstruction and put out a self-titled one-off album in 1994. Dave Navarro joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1993 and in the same year Stephen Perkins started a band named Banyan, with core members Nels Cline, Mike Watt, and Willie Waldman (with revolving studio guests). Banyan have released three albums as of 2008, their self titled-debut, Any Time at All and Live At Perkins Place. Dave Navarro and the Red Hot Chili Peppers &apos;s Flea joined Porno for Pyros to record &quot; Hard Charger &quot; in 1997 for Howard Stern&apos;s movie, Private Parts soundtrack which led to a brief Jane&apos;s Addiction Relapse tour with Flea replacing Avery as bassist, after he declined an invitation to rejoin the band. They produced a compilation album, entitled Kettle Whistle. This album featured two new songs with Flea contributing the bass parts. In 2010, Perkins stated that &quot; Flea, to me, was a great match in &apos;97. As a drummer, he was very exciting for me to work with. &quot; [ http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/janes-addictions-stephen-perkins-on-duff-mckagan-band-future-243049/2 Jane&apos;s Addiction&apos;s Stephen Perkins on Duff McKagan, band future Joe Bosso MusicRadar ] Despite the successful tour, from the photos taken of the band at this point and their appearance on Saturday Night Live (Ep. 431, Nov. 8, 1997), Farrell&apos;s addiction to drugs had become more serious. Appearing on stage without a shirt, Farrell looked frighteningly emaciated with the overall look of someone in the advanced stages of starvation. Years later, he would conquer his addictions and recreate a much healthier life, but, at that point, it appeared his addiction had gotten the better of him and his health. [ Strays (2001–2004) ] The 2001 Jubilee Tour featured all the old Jane&apos;s Addiction songs, while showcasing the recent solo release from Navarro, Trust No One. Fans were told to expect a &quot; Sexual Psycho Circus, I am not sure if you will want to quote me on that, but fans will see half-naked, penny rafters, guitar solos, and tribal drums... &quot; This was exactly what the fans got. During renditions of Classic Girl, illuminated, scantily clad stage dancers filled the arenas. For the tour, again Avery declined any involvement. With Flea busy with the Chili Peppers, Porno for Pyros bassist Martyn LeNoble was brought in to fill the gap. Following the success of this tour, the band decided to record a follow-up album to 1990&apos;s Ritual De Lo Habitual and tapped Chris Chaney to replace LeNoble on bass. They entered the studio with legendary producer Bob Ezrin in 2001, recording as a band for the first time in over 10 years. The result was the group&apos;s third album, Strays. Some of the songs (or parts of songs) dated far back in the band&apos;s history, while others were brand new. Criticism was generally favorable, [ http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/janesaddiction/strays?q%3Djane%27s%20addiction Jane&apos;s Addiction: Strays (2003): Reviews www.metacritic.com July 19, 2008 ] with Rolling Stone reporting that &quot; The band sounds familiar &quot; and &quot; beefier &quot; though without the &quot; glint of madness &quot; of the original line-up.

The band spent 2003 on an extensive worldwide tour in support of Strays, including, in a homecoming of sorts, a summer headliner slot in a reincarnated Lollapalooza U.S. tour. Jane&apos;s Addiction once again broke up towards the end of their 2003 touring and canceled several dates. Although exact details surrounding the band&apos;s demise are sparse, Navarro claimed on his website, { 6767 } in June 2004, that the reasons for the breakup were essentially the same as they were in 1991. Perkins would later state, &quot; We always break-up if it’s not real. We really can’t fake it. I mean we can make a million dollars for three months touring but we would fucking hate each other, which isn’t good. Even with the nostalgia, it&apos;s not worth it if it doesn’t sound good, or look good. One of the things with Jane&apos;s is that we have never been good at faking it. &quot; [ http://stereogum.com/812261/progress-report-janes-addiction/franchises/progress-report/ Progress Report: Jane’s Addiction Stereogum 2011-09-15 2011-10-24 ] [ Second breakup (2004–2008) ] During their second major split, the band were involved in a number of other projects. Navarro, Perkins, and Chaney formed a new band, The Panic Channel, with singer Steve Isaacs, who together released one album, titled (ONe), in 2006. Perry Farrell, together with his wife Etty Lau Farrell and former Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt, formed The Satellite Party. The band signed with Columbia Records and released their debut album, Ultra Payloaded in 2007. Eric Avery signed with Dangerbird Records for the release of his solo album Help Wanted in 2008. A Greatest Hits album titled Up from the Catacombs – The Best of Jane&apos;s Addiction was released on September 19, 2006. [ Reunion with Eric Avery and NIN/JA Tour (2008–2010) ] Jane&apos;s Addiction performed at the first-ever NME Awards USA on April 23, 2008, with the reunited core line-up of Perry Farrell, Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, and Stephen Perkins.

Something&apos;s feeling right about it. &quot; [ By  Steve Baltin http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/perry-farrell-janes-addiction-tour-inspired-by-boardwalk-empire-era-20120131 Perry Farrell: Jane&apos;s Addiction Tour Inspired by &apos;Boardwalk Empire&apos; Era &amp; #124; Music News Rolling Stone 2012-01-31 2012-03-31 ] [ Band members ] [ Current members ] Perry Farrell – lead vocals (1985–1991, 1997, 2001–2004, 2008–present) Dave Navarro – lead &amp; rhythm guitars, acoustic guitar, piano (1986–1991, 1997, 2001–2004, 2008–present) Stephen Perkins – drums, percussion, steel pan (1986–1991, 1997, 2001–2004, 2008–present) Chris Chaney – bass guitar (2002–2004, one-off appearances in 2009 &amp; 2010, 2011–present) [ Former members ] [ http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2011/05/20/perry-farrell-janes-addiction-dave-sitek-queen Perry Farrell Battles Queen for a Bassist, Plots Dream Lineup for Lollapalooza 2012 Spinner ] Dave Sitek – bass guitar (2010–2011) (in studio) Duff McKagan – bass (March–September 2010) Eric Avery – bass, acoustic guitar (1985–1991, 2008–2010) Martyn LeNoble – bass (2000–2002) Flea – bass (1997) [ Timeline ] ImageSize = width:845 height:auto barincrement:30PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50Alignbars = justifyDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyyPeriod = from:01/01/1985 till:05/01/2012TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = { id:Vocals value:redorange legend:Vocals } { id:Bass value:purple legend:Bass } { id:Drums value:teal legend:Drums } { id:Guitar value:brightblue legend:Guitar } Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:01/01/1985ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/1985 LineData = { at:08/23/1988 color:black layer:back } { at:08/21/1990 color:black layer:back } { at:07/22/2003 color:black layer:back } { at:10/18/2011 color:black layer:back } BarData = { bar:Farrell text: &quot; Perry Farrell &quot; } { bar:Avery text: &quot; Eric Avery &quot; } { bar:Brinkman text: &quot; Chris Brinkman &quot; } { bar:Fanuka text: &quot; Matt Fanuka &quot; } { bar:Chaikin text: &quot; Matt Chaikin &quot; } { bar:Pritchard text: &quot; Mark Pritchard &quot; } { bar:Ed text: &quot; Ed Dobrydnio &quot; } { bar:Perkins text: &quot; Stephen Perkins &quot; } { bar:Navarro text: &quot; Dave Navarro &quot; } { bar:Flea text: &quot; Flea &quot; } { bar:LeNoble text: &quot; Martyn LeNoble &quot; } { bar:Chaney text: &quot; Chris Chaney &quot; } { bar:Duff text: &quot; Duff McKagan &quot; } { bar:Sitek text: &quot; Dave Sitek &quot; } PlotData= { width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) } { bar:Farrell from:08/01/1985 till:09/26/1991 color:Vocals } { bar:Farrell from:08/01/1997 till:12/08/1997 color:Vocals } { bar:Farrell from:01/01/2001 till:06/01/2004 color:Vocals } { bar:Farrell from:04/23/2008 till:end color:Vocals } { bar:Chaikin from:10/24/1985 till:02/01/1986 color:Drums } { bar:Perkins from:03/01/1986 till:09/26/1991 color:Drums } { bar:Perkins from:08/01/1997 till:12/08/1997 color:Drums } { bar:Perkins from:08/01/1997 till:12/08/1997 color:Drums } { bar:Perkins from:01/01/2001 till:06/01/2004 color:Drums } { bar:Perkins from:04/23/2008 till:end color:Drums } { bar:Fanuka from:10/24/1985 till:10/28/1985 color:Guitar } { bar:Brinkman from:10/24/1985 till:01/01/1986 color:Guitar } { bar:Pritchard from:01/01/1986 till:01/10/1986 color:Guitar } { bar:Ed from:01/10/1986 till:02/01/1986 color:Guitar } { bar:Navarro from:03/01/1986 till:09/26/1991 color:Guitar } { bar:Navarro from:08/01/1997 till:12/08/1997 color:Guitar } { bar:Navarro from:08/01/1997 till:12/08/1997 color:Guitar } { bar:Navarro from:01/01/2001 till:06/01/2004 color:Guitar } { bar:Navarro from:04/23/2008 till:end color:Guitar } { bar:Avery from:08/01/1985 till:09/26/1991 color:Bass } { bar:Avery from:04/23/2008 till:03/01/2010 color:Bass } { bar:Flea from:08/01/1997 till:12/08/1997 color:Bass } { bar:LeNoble from:01/01/2001 till:07/28/2002 color:Bass } { bar:Chaney from:08/19/2002 till:06/01/2004 color:Bass } { bar:Chaney from:12/31/2009 till:01/01/2010 color:Bass } { bar:Chaney from:10/16/2010 till:10/16/2010 color:Bass } { bar:Chaney from:03/17/2011 till:end color:Bass } { bar:Duff from:03/02/2010 till:09/07/2010 color:Bass } { bar:Sitek from:09/01/2010 till:08/03/2011 color:Bass } [ Discography ] [ Jane&apos;s Addiction discography ] [ Studio albums ] Nothing&apos;s Shocking (1988) Ritual de lo Habitual (1990) Strays (2003) The Great Escape Artist (2011) [ Notes ] [ 2 ] [ References ] Mullen, Brendan.
