As of 2010, the population was 8,997. The county seat is Prescott. [ 6 ] Nevada County is Arkansas&apos;s 63rd county, formed on March 20, 1871, and named for the State of Nevada due to the perceived similarity between their physical shapes; the Arkansas county&apos;s shape roughly follows the same outline as the state&apos;s boundary when inverted. Contrasting with the name of the U.S. state, the local pronunciation for the southwestern Arkansas county is &quot; nuh-VAY-duh &quot;. It is an alcohol prohibition or dry county. Nevada County is part of the Hope Micropolitan Statistical Area. Dorcheat Bayou, a 122-mile stream, begins in Nevada County. It flows south into Columbia County and then Webster Parish, Louisiana, and empties into Lake Bistineau. In the 19th century, the bayou was navigable for three to six months by steamboat from Bistineau to Minden. It is now popular for fishing and natural beauty.
