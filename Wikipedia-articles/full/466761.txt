Ready 2 Rock &quot; and &quot; I Love the Night &quot;. The single, &quot; Going Through The Motions &quot; charted in the American Top 40. The cover art is demonstrative of BÖC&apos;s use of lasers in their live show at that time. While the album didn&apos;t have the lasting power of its predecessor Agents of Fortune, it is a BÖC fan favorite. A remaster of this album was released on CD on February 13, 2007, which included four previously unreleased outtakes from Spectres sessions as bonus tracks. &quot; Goin&apos; Through the Motions &quot; was later covered by Bonnie Tyler on her album Faster Than the Speed of Night. As of April 2012, this is the last studio album to have been remastered and reissued with bonus tracks in the BoC catalogue.
