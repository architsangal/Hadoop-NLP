[ Plot ] [ Act 1 ] The film opens with Chorus ( Derek Jacobi ) in a modern setting, calling for a &quot; Muse of fire &quot; so that the actor playing King Henry might &quot; assume the port of Mars &quot; and that the audience&apos;s imagination will overcome any limitations the stage may present. He concludes, calling for a patience audience and asking the viewer &quot; Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play! &quot; The scene then cuts to early 15th century England, where the Bishop of Ely ( Alec McCowen ) and the Archbishop of Canterbury ( Charles Kay ) conspire of a way to prevent the young King Henry V ( Kenneth Branagh ) from passing a bill that would potentially confiscate power from the church by convincing the King to invade France. Later, in the throne room, Canterbury gives the other noblemen a lengthy explanation as to why Henry V is rightful heir to the throne of France, citing old technicalities in French and English inheritance laws. The clergymen urge Henry to invade, as do his advisors Exeter ( Brian Blessed ) and Westmoreland ( Paul Gregory ), who believe war is the only way to obtain Henry&apos;s claim. The King then calls in the French ambassador Mountjoy ( Christopher Ravenscroft ) representing the Dauphin, whom the French see as rightful heir to the throne. The Dauphin&apos;s message is condescending, claiming that Henry &quot; savours too much &quot; of his youth. To top it off, Henry is presented with a &quot; treasure &quot; of tennis balls from the Dauphin. This enrages King Henry who declares his intent to attack France, saying of the Dauphin, &quot; His jest will savour but of shallow wit, when thousands weep more than did laugh at it. &quot; The ambassador is then dismissed as Henry and his advisors start preparations for their invasion. [ Act 2 ] The scene then shifts to a London tavern, as a narrating Chorus informs us that England is fired up and preparing for war. There, Bardolph ( Richard Briers ) appears, trying to resolve a fight between the feuding Nym ( Geoffrey Hutchings ) and Pistol ( Robert Stephens ) over Mistress Quickly ( Judi Dench ), who was promised to marry the former, but wed the latter. A boy ( Christian Bale ) interrupts, informing everyone present that their friend Sir John Falstaff ( Robbie Coltrane ) is deathly ill and they stop quarreling to visit him, hinting that Henry somehow caused Falstaff&apos;s ill health. The scene then flashes back to happier times with John Falstaff and others in the tavern, where King Henry is seen ending his childhood friendship with Falstaff, saying &quot; I know thee not, old man. &quot; The scene cuts to the White Cliffs of Dover where Chorus informs us that three traitors have been found in the ranks of Henry’s advisors; Earl of Cambridge (Fabian Cartwright), Lord Scroop (Stephen Simms), and Sir Thomas Grey (Jay Villiers). Later, in Southampton, the King prepares for France and confronts the three traitors, who do not yet know he has discovered their treachery. Henry tricks them into pronouncing their own sentence by asking advice on a similar case, to which they show little mercy. The King then reveals his knowledge of their sedition and declares that all three are to be executed before ordering his fleet to depart for France. Back in London, Pistol, Bardolph, Nym, Mistress Quickly, and the boy grieve the loss of Falstaff, who has passed away. Despite their sorrow, the men must finally leave for the war, bidding farewell to Mistress Quickly. Meanwhile, Charles VI, the King of France ( Paul Scofield ) and his noblemen discuss the approach of King Henry&apos;s army. While the Dauphin ( Michael Maloney ) still believes Henry to be young and foolish, Charles and the Constable of France ( Richard Easton ) do not share his views, remembering Henry&apos;s warlike bloodline and their previous attempts at conquering France. They are interrupted when Exeter arrives in full armor bearing a message from King Henry, who has already landed in France. Henry demands that King Charles surrender the crown and all honors and lands that may come with it. If Charles refuses, Henry will take France by force. Charles responds by saying he will send Exeter back to his king with an answer in the morning. [ Act 3 ] In the next scene, King Henry&apos;s forces are attacking the castle at Harfleur. Chorus informs the audience than an alarmed King Charles offered Henry a compromise that included small dukedoms and the hand of his daughter, Catherine, in marriage, which Henry refused. The siege thus ensues and Henry delivers a powerful speech, conjuring memories of the Englishmen’s warlike ancestors. Nim, Bardolph, and Pistol have a mixed reaction to the speech, turn to run while those around them charge before a Welsh Captain named Fluellen ( Ian Holm ) frightens them back into the fight. Later, Fluellen and an officer named Gower ( Danny Webb ) discuss the mines that the English have dug in order to breech the walls of Harfleur. Fluellen believes the mines are being built incorrectly and belittles the Irish Captain MacMorris ( John Sessions ) who is in charge of their construction while praising Captain Jamy ( Jimmy Yuill ), the officer in charge of the Scottish troops. When MacMorris and Jamy arrive, Fluellen offers MacMorris advice on about digging the tunnels and offends him. The two nearly break into a fight before they are interrupted by retreating English troops. King Henry then appears before the gates of Harfleur, calling upon the governor of the town. When the governor appears on the town&apos;s walls, Henry declares that no harm will befall Harfleur if the French surrender the city, but if Henry must fight his way in then the English will destroy the town, rape the women, and kill the children. The governor then reluctantly surrenders Harfleur, having been informed from the Dauphin that no French army can be mobilized in time to save the town. Henry then orders Harfleur to be fortified as a citadel from which to fight the French army. In the French court, Charles’s daughter, Catherine ( Emma Thompson ), speaks in French with her maid Alice ( Geraldine McEwan ). Alice, having spent time in England, knows some of the language, so Catherine asks Alice to teach her some words. Catherine mispronounces them humorously, but is keen to learn them until they are interrupted by Charles and his entourage passing through the castle halls. King Charles, the Dauphin, and his advisors then hold an urgent meeting to discuss the English invasion. The French noblemen are hot to repel the English advance, feeling their national honor has been damaged by the incursion. Charles then orders his nobles to raise troops for an army, confident that with such great a force they can conquer King Henry&apos;s army and capture him as a prisoner. The scene then cuts to Henry&apos;s army advancing through rain and mud. Pistol comes to beg Fluellen for the life of Bardolf, who has apparently robbed a church. Fluellen, however, is unforgiving and holds that Bardolf will hang for his crimes as any other soldier would. When Henry arrives, he is heartbroken to learn that Bardolf, an old friend, has committed such a crime, but sees the execution through. The French ambassador Mountjoy then arrives, declaring that the forces of King Charles will punish Henry and that he should begin thinking of a ransom with which to pay back the French once they&apos;ve overtaken his army. Henry&apos;s response is mostly neutral, admitting that his army is worn and tired, but that he will continue to advance because he believes it is his right to conquer France and that his army will be victorious. His army then proceeds to make camp. Chorus then transitions the scene to the French camp, where the noblemen eagerly await the upcoming battle. The French then start their preparations for battle, patronizing the weak English army and foolish King Henry. [ Act 4 ] As Chorus narrates, the scene returns to the English camp. Henry talks briefly with his brothers, Gloucester ( Simon Shepherd ) and Bedford ( James Larkin ), and with old Sir Thomas Erpingham ( Edward Jewesbury ), before borrowing Erpingham&apos;s cloak, disguising himself from the common soldiers. Henry then tours the camp, pretending to be a soldier named Harry le Roy, in order to know the minds of his troops. The first person he meets is Pistol, who praises the King in his own strange way. Henry then comes to three common soldiers, Bates ( Shaun Prendergast ), Court ( Patrick Doyle ), and Williams ( Michael Williams ), who have a less than flattering opinion of the King. Henry defends the king, but Williams will not back down, so they agree to a quarrel, promising to fight each other after the battle. The three soldiers eventually depart, leaving Henry to contemplate the isolation of power and lament the duties which lie on his head. He prays to God for strength of heart in his soldiers and begs forgiveness for the bloody method by which Henry&apos;s father, Henry IV, obtained the crown of England. The next morning, the French overlook the battlefield and prepare to mount their horses. They expect an easy victory, observing how outnumbered and ragged the English army appears. Meanwhile, the English noblemen realize that they are outnumbered five to one, when Westmorland wishes for &quot; one ten-thousand of those men in England who do no work today! &quot; Henry overhears him and disagrees. He then delivers a morale-boosting speech, saying that they should be happy for their small army, which will have a greater share of honor. He goes on to say that anyone who fights with him, soldier or noblemen, will be his brother and concludes that any Englishman who stayed at home will think himself cursed for not being present at this fight. Mountjoy comes one last time for ransom, asking that Henry surrender or be defeated in battle. Henry rejects the offer and instructs the messenger to offer no more ransom. A bloody battle ensues as the French forces charge at the English. Henry, having equipped his army with many long bow archers, is able to cripple a large part of the French force. During the combat, Nym is stabbed and killed while trying to rob the bodies of dead soldiers. The Constable of France is also slain, as the astonished French noblemen realize that victory will likely be in the hands of the English. They decide to continue the fight, rather than be shamed in surrender. A small number of angered French soldiers ride into the English camp, looting goods and killing the young pages. Fluellen, who is first to arrive at the scene, becomes enraged, as this violated the chivalrous codes of warfare. Henry arrives furious, swearing that he had not been angry since arriving in France until that moment. Henry then confronts Mountjoy, who informs him that the English forces have in fact won the battle ( &quot; The day... is yours. &quot; ). [ Act 5 ] [ February 2012 ] [ Cast ] The cast includes many well-known actors: Derek Jacobi as the Chorus, Brian Blessed as Exeter, Ian Holm as Fluellen, Christian Bale as the Boy, Paul Scofield as the King of France, Judi Dench as Mistress Quickly, Richard Briers as Bardolph, Robert Stephens as Pistol and Emma Thompson as Princess Katherine. The actor Michael Williams plays the character &quot; Michael Williams &quot;. Robbie Coltrane appears in a cameo performance as Falstaff.

In addition, Branagh incorporated flashbacks using extracts from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 in which Henry interacts with the character of Falstaff, who, in Shakespeare&apos;s Henry V, is never seen, merely announced to be deathly ill in Act 2 Scene 1, and dead in Act 2 scene 3. The scenes involve a brief summary of Henry&apos;s denouncement of Falstaff primarily with lines from Act 2, Scene 4 of Henry IV part 1 and a brief though important utterance of Henry&apos;s final repudiation of Falstaff in Part 2, &quot; I know thee not, old man. &quot; The movie also uses Falstaff&apos;s line &quot; do not, when thou art King, hang a thief &quot; from Henry IV Part 1 but gives it to Bardolph, in order to highlight the poignancy when Henry later has Bardolph executed. [ Filming ] Henry V was made on an estimated budget of $9 million. { Henry V (1989) - Box office / business. Retrieved 12 February 2012. } The film was produced by Bruce Sharman with the British Broadcasting Corporation and Branagh&apos;s company Renaissance Films. Principal photography commenced on 31 October 1988 and concluded 19 December the same year. Sixty percent of production was shot on sound stages at Shepperton Studios, while many of the battle sequences were shot on fields adjacent to the Shepperton complex. { Henry V DVD (2000). &quot; Collectable Booklet &quot;. } [ Style ] Branagh&apos;s film is frequently compared with the 1944 film of the play directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. The visual style of Branagh&apos;s film is grittier and more realistic than that of Olivier&apos;s. For example, his film avoids Olivier&apos;s use of stylized sets, and, where Olivier staged the Battle of Agincourt on a sunlit field, Branagh&apos;s takes place amid rain-drenched mud and gore. Nearly all of the scenes involving the comic characters were also staged as drama, rather than in the broad, more slapstick way in which Olivier staged them, because Branagh felt that modern audiences would not see the humor in these scenes. While the text of the Chorus&apos; monologues are the same, the setting for them has been adapted to reflect the nature of the motion picture adaptation of the play. Unlike the other performers, who are dressed in clothing contemporary to the actual Henry V to reflect their characters, the Chorus is dressed in modern 20th century clothing. The opening monologue, originally written to compensate for the limitations of on stage theater to represent the historical scenes presented, is delivered on an empty motion picture sound stage with unfinished sets. The other chorus monologues are delivered on location where the relevant action is taking place. In all cases, the chorus speaks directly to the camera, addressing the audience.

[ Critical reception ] Henry V received near-universal critical acclaim for Branagh&apos;s Oscar-nominated performance and direction, for the accessibility of its Shakespearean language, and for its score by Patrick Doyle. It currently holds a rare 100% &quot; Fresh &quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic score of 83 out of 100, based on seventeen reviews--all positive. { Henry V. } { Metacritic.

Roger Ebert, noted critic of the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, highly praising Branagh&apos;s performance and writing, &quot; There is no more stirring summons to arms in all of literature than Henry&apos;s speech to his troops on St. Crispan&apos;s Day, ending with the lyrical &apos;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.&apos; To deliver this speech successfully is to pass the acid test for anyone daring to perform the role of Henry V in public, and as Kenneth Branagh, as Henry, stood up on the dawn of the Battle of Agincourt and delivered the famous words, I was emotionally stirred even though I had heard them many times before. That is one test of a great Shakespearian actor: to take the familiar and make it new. &quot; [ Ebert Roger Henry V Chicago Sun-Times 15 December 1989 http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F19891215%2FREVIEWS%2F912150302 20 January 2012 ] Variety magazine also gave the film a positive review, calling Henry V &quot; A stirring, gritty and enjoyable pic which offers a plethora of fine performances from some of the U.K.&apos;s brightest talents. &quot; [ Variety Staff Henry V Variety 31 December 1989 http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791604?refcatid%3D31 20 January 2012 ] [ Accolades ] Award Category Recipients and nominees Result Academy Award s Best Actor Kenneth Branagh Best Costume Design Phyllis Dalton Best Director Kenneth Branagh British Academy Film Awards Best Actor in a Leading Role Kenneth Branagh Best Cinematography Kenneth MacMillan Best Costume Design Phyllis Dalton Best Direction Kenneth Branagh Best Production Design Tim Harvey Best Sound Campbell Askew, David Crozier, Robin O&apos;Donoghue Chicago Film Critics Association Awards Best Foreign Language Film Kenneth Branagh Best Actor European Film Awards Best Actor Kenneth Branagh Best Director Best Young Film Evening Standard British Film Awards Best Film Kenneth Branagh Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists European Silver Ribbon Kenneth Branagh National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Best Director Kenneth Branagh New York Film Critics Circle Awards Best New Director Kenneth Brangah Sant Jordi Awards Best Foreign Actor Kenneth Branagh [ Home media ] A pan and scan VHS was released through CBS/Fox Video in 1990.
