[ History ] Map of the Albia area from 1908, showing the railroads, mining camps and coal mines (in red) of the region. On Feb. 14, 1893, there was a coal mine explosion in Chicago and Iowa mine, about 2.5 miles west of Albia. This room and pillar mine opened around 1877, and by the time of the explosion, mining extended more than 1000 yards from the hoisting shaft and the mine employed 60 miners and 20 other men. One miner was killed outright and seven died later of their injuries, after a &quot; shot &quot; (gunpower charge used to bring down the coal) ignited a dust explosion in the mine. This was one of only two major mine disasters in Iowa between 1888 and 1913. { Albert H. Fay, Coal-Mine Fatalities in the United States 1870–1914, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Washington DC, 1916, page 190. } { Sixth Biennial Report of the State Mine Inspectors to the Governor of the State of Iowa for the Two Yers Ending June 30, 1893, Ragsdale, Des Moines, 1893, pages 29–35. } In the early 20th century, the region around Albia was dotted with coal mining camps and company town s. Of these, Buxton, 9 miles north, is the most widely studied. { David M. Gradwohl and Nancy M.
