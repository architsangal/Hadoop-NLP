[ the album by Alien Sex Fiend Information Overload (album) ] [ September 2008 ] &quot; Information overload &quot; is a term popularized by Alvin Toffler in his bestselling 1970 book Future Shock. It refers to the difficulty a person can have understanding an issue and making decisions that can be caused by the presence of too much information. [ C.C. Yang Hsinchun Chen Kay Honga 2003 Visualization of large category map for Internet browsing Decision Support Systems 35 1 89–102 10.1016/S0167-9236(02)00101-X ] The term itself is mentioned in a 1964 book by Bertram Gross, The Managing of Organizations.

(2003). Early modern information overload. Journal of the History of Ideas, 64(1), 1-9. Retrieved from http://jhi.pennpress.org/ } or viewed as a psychology phenomenon. { Dictionary.com. (2011). Information overload, -noun psychology. Retrieved from http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/information+overload } In psychology, information overload relates to an overabundance of incoming information into the senses. Toffler&apos;s explanation of it presents information overload as the Information Age &apos;s version of sensory overload, a term that had been introduced in the 1950s. { An article in Science magazine in 1959 about a conference held in June 1958 at Harvard Medical School mentions that Donald B. Lindsley had given a paper titled &quot; Are there common factors in sensory deprivation, sensory distortion and sensory overload? &quot; &quot; Meetings, &quot; in Science, Vol 129, No. 3343, Jan 23, 1959, pp. 221-225. } Sensory overload was thought to cause disorientation and lack of responsiveness. Toffler posited information overload as having the same sorts of effects, but on the higher cognitive functions, writing: &quot; When the individual is plunged into a fast and irregularly changing situation, or a novelty-loaded context... his predictive accuracy plummets. He can no longer make the reasonably correct assessments on which rational behavior is dependent. &quot; { Future Shock, pp. 350-1 (1970 edition) } As the world moves into a new era of globalization, an increasing number of people are connecting to the Internet to conduct their own research { Internet World Stats (2008)INTERNET USAGE STATISTICS The Internet Big Picture - World Internet Users and Population Stats 2000-2008. } and are given the ability to produce as well as consume the data accessed on an increasing number of website s. { Bonfield, B.

(1993), &quot; An Age of Discontinuity &quot;, in Sleepers Wake! Technology and the Future of Work, 3rd Ed., Melbourne, Oxford University Press, pp. 11-45 } More and more people are considered to be active writers and viewers because of their participation. { Jenkins, H. (2006) Fans, Bloggers and Gamers: Exploring Participatory Culture, New York University Press } This flow has created a new life where we are now in danger of becoming dependent on this method of access to information. { Cheng, R &amp; Vassileva (2006) Design and Evaluation of an adoptive incentive mechanism for sustained educational online communities, User modeling and user-adapted interaction. Dordrecht. Sep 2006, Volume 16, Issue 3-4, p321. } { Baxter, A. (2008) Better interactivity benefits student faculty, Financial Times, London (UK) March 17th 2008, p4 } Therefore we see an information overload from the access to so much information, almost instantaneously, without knowing the validity of the content and the risk of misinformation. { Flew, T. (2008) New Media: an introduction, Third Edition, Oxford University Press: Australia } { Graham, G. (1999) The Internet: a philosophical inquiry, London: Routledge } According to Sonora Jha of Seattle University, journalists are using the Web to conduct their research, getting information regarding interviewing sources and press releases, updating news online, and thus it shows the gradual shifts in attitudes because of the rapid increase in use of the Internet. { Sonora Jha, 2007, Social Movements, The Internet and The Press, Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly-New Media, Volume 84, No.1, pg 42 } Lawrence Lessig has described this as the &quot; read-write &quot; nature of the internet. [ http://www.lessig.org/blog/2006/01/the_readwrite_internet.html The Read-Write Internet January 17, 2006 ] [ History ] [ Early history ] Information overload has been documented throughout periods where advances in technology have increased a production of information. { Blair, A. (2010a, November 28). Information overload, the early years. The Boston Globe. Retrieved from http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/11/28/information_overload_the_early_years/ } As early as the 3rd or 4th century BC, people regarded information overload with disapproval. Around this time, in Ecclesiastes 12:12, the passage revealed the writer’s comment “of making books there is no end” and in 1st century AD, Seneca the Elder commented, that “the abundance of books is distraction”. Similar complaints around the growth of books were also mentioned in China. { Blair, A. (2010b, November 28). Information overload, then and now. The Chronicle Review. Retrieved from http://chronicle.com/article/Information-Overload-Then-and/125479/ } [ Renaissance ] Around 1440 AD, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press and this marked another period of information proliferation. As a result of lowering production costs, generation of printed materials ranging from pamphlets, manuscripts to books were made available to the average person. { Blair, A. (2011, March 14). Information overload&apos;s 2300-year-old history. Harvard Business Review. Retrieved from http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/03/information_overloads_2300-yea.html } Scholars complained about the abundance of information for a variety of reasons such as the diminishing quality of text as printers rushed to print manuscripts and they also felt the supply of new information was distracting and difficult to manage. [ Information age ] In the 20th Century, advances in computer and information technology introduced the internet. In more recent years, of the information age, information overload is experienced as distracting and unmanageable information such as email spam, email notifications, instant messages, Tweets and Facebook updates in the context of the work environment. { Hemp, P. (2009, September). Death by information overload. Harvard Business Review, 87(9), 83-89. Retrieved from http://hbr.org/ } As a result, an interruption from such information negatively affects the attention of an employee. It can take upwards of twenty-five minutes before the worker returns to their assigned tasks after viewing an email. [ Origin ] A quite early example of the term information overload can be found in an article by Jacob Jacoby, Donald Speller and Carol Kohn Berning, who conducted an experiment on 192 housewives which was said to confirm the hypothesis that more information about brands would lead to poorer decision making. { Brand Choice Behavior as a Function of Information Load: Replication and Extension(1974) Journal of consumer research, Volume: 1, Issue: 1 (June 1974), pp: 33-42. } But long before that, the idea was introduced by Diderot, although it wasn&apos;t by the term &apos;information overload&apos;: &quot; As long as the centuries continue to unfold, the number of books will grow continually, and one can predict that a time will come when it will be almost as difficult to learn anything from books as from the direct study of the whole universe. It will be almost as convenient to search for some bit of truth concealed in nature as it will be to find it hidden away in an immense multitude of bound volumes. &quot; – Denis Diderot, &quot; Encyclopédie &quot; (1755) [ General causes ] The general causes of information overload include: A rapidly increasing rate of new information being produced The ease of duplication and transmission of data across the Internet An increase in the available channels of incoming information (e.g. telephone, e-mail, instant messaging, rss ) Large amounts of historical information to dig through Contradictions and inaccuracies in available information A low signal-to-noise ratio A lack of a method for comparing and processing different kinds of information The pieces of information are unrelated or do not have any overall structure to reveal their relationships E-mail remains a major source of information overload, as people struggle to keep up with the rate of incoming messages. As well as filtering out unsolicited commercial messages ( spam ), users also have to contend with the growing use of email attachments in the form of lengthy reports, presentations and media files. A December 2007 New York Times blog post described E-mail as &quot; a $650 Billion Drag on the Economy &quot;, [ http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/is-information-overload-a-650-billion-drag-on-the-economy Is Information Overload a $650 Billion Drag on the Economy? 2007-12-20 New York Times Steve Lohr 2010-05-05 ] and the New York Times reported in April 2008 that &quot; E-MAIL has become the bane of some people&apos;s professional lives &quot; due to information overload, yet &quot; none of [the current wave of high-profile Internet startups focused on email] really eliminates the problem of e-mail overload because none helps us prepare replies &quot;.

Quoted in the article, workplace productivity expert Marsha Egan stated that people need to differentiate between working on e-mail and sorting through it. This meant that rather than responding to every email right away, users should delete unnecessary emails and sort the others into action or reference folders first. Egan then went on to say “We are more wired than ever before, and as a result need to be more mindful of managing email or it will end up managing us.” [ Tahmincioglu Eve Dealing with a bloated inbox http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41135478/ns/business-personal_finance/t/its-time-deal-overflowing-inbox/ MSNBC 2011-09-22 ] The Daily Telegraph quoted Nicholas Carr, former executive editor of the Harvard Business Review and the author of The Shallows: What The Internet Is Doing To Our Brains, as saying that email exploits a basic human instinct to search for new information, causing people to become addicted to &quot; mindlessly pressing levers in the hope of receiving a pellet of social or intellectual nourishment &quot;. His concern is shared by Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, who stated that “instantaneous devices” and the abundance of information people are exposed to through e-mail and other technology-based sources could be having an impact on the thought process, obstructing deep thinking, understanding, impedes the formation of memories and makes learning more difficult. This condition of &quot; cognitive overload &quot; results in diminished information retaining ability and failing to connect remembrances to experiences stored in the long-term memory, leaving thoughts &quot; thin and scattered &quot;.

(2009), Information Inflation. Journal of Information Ethics, 18 (2), pp. 27-37 (esp. pp. 34, 35) } Technology investors reflect similar concerns.

In many offices, workers are given unrestricted access to the Web, allowing them to manage their own research. The use of search engine s helps users to find information quickly. However, information published online may not always be reliable, due to the lack of authority-approval or a compulsory accuracy check before publication. This results in people having to cross-check what they read before using it for decision-making, which takes up more time. [ Responses ] [ Response of business and government ] [ January 2008 ] Many academics, corporate decision-makers, and federal policy-makers recognize the magnitude and growing impact of this phenomenon. In June 2008 a group of interested researchers from a diverse set of corporations, smaller companies, academic institutions and consultancies created the Information Overload Research Group ( IORG ), a non-profit interest group dedicated to raising awareness, sharing research results and promoting the creation of solutions around Information Overload. { Lost in E-mail, Tech Firms Face Self-Made Beast } Recent research suggests that an &quot; attention economy &quot; of sorts will naturally emerge from information overload, allowing Internet users greater control over their online experience with particular regard to communication mediums such as e-mail and instant messaging. This could involve some sort of cost being attached to e-mail messages. For example, managers charging a small fee for every e-mail received - e.g. $5.00 - which the sender must pay from their budget. The aim of such charging is to force the sender to consider the necessity of the interruption. However, such a suggestion undermines the entire basis of the popularity of e-mail, namely that e-mails are free. [ Media ] Media like the internet are conducting research to promote awareness of information overload. In, Kyunghye Kim, Mia Liza A. Lustria, Darrell Burke, and Nahyun Kwon conducted a study regarding people who have encountered information overload while searching for health information about cancer and what the impact on them was. The conclusion drawn from the research discusses how health information should be distributed and that information campaigns should be held to prevent irrelevant or incorrect information being circulated on the internet. Other than that, there are many books published to encourage awareness of information overload and to train the reader to process information more consciously and effectively. Books like &quot; Surviving Information Overload &quot; by Kevin A. Miller, &quot; Managing Information Overload &quot; by Lynn Lively. [ http://books.google.com.my/books?q%3Dinformation%2Boverload ] and &quot; The Principle of Relevance &quot; by Stefania Lucchetti deal effectively with the topic. { The Principle of Relevance, Stefania Lucchetti, RT Publishing 2010, Hong Kong. http://www.stefanialucchetti.com } [ The problem of organization ] Some cognitive scientist s and graphic designers have emphasized the distinction between raw information and information in a form we can use in thinking. In this view, information overload may be better viewed as organization underload. That is, they suggest that the problem is not so much the volume of information but the fact that we can&apos;t discern how to use it well in the raw or biased form it is presented to us. Authors who have taken this tack include graphic artist and architect Richard Saul Wurman (the man who coined the phrase information architect ) and statistician and cognitive scientist Edward Tufte. Wurman uses the term &quot; information anxiety &quot; to describe our attitude toward the volume of information in general and our limitations in processing it. Tufte primarily focuses on quantitative information and explores ways to organize large complex datasets visually to facilitate clear thinking. [ Related terms ] [ December 2011 ] A similar term &quot; information pollution &quot; was coined by Jakob Nielsen The term &quot; interruption overload &quot; has begun to appear in newspapers such as the Financial Times http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d0f71fb6-3243-11db-ab06-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=4e612cca-6707-11da-a650-0000779e2340,print=yes.html &quot; TMI &quot; (too much information), an acronym alluding to information overload but often used in jest Cognitive dissonance Continuous Partial Attention Internet addiction Learning curve Memory Mind-expanding Multi-tasking [ See also ] Accelerando, a 2005 science fiction novel about information overload and accelerating change Glass cockpit Information explosion Overchoice Attention management Attention economy Lexicographic information cost Stress management Time management Information pollution Analysis paralysis [ References ] [ 2 ] Category:Library science Category:Information Age Category:Systemic Risk - Behavioral &amp; Social Facets ar:إغراق معلوماتي ca:Infoxicació de:Informationsüberflutung es:Sobrecarga informativa eo:Informa superŝarĝo eu:Infoxikazio fa:سرریز داده‌ها fr:Surcharge informationnelle id:Kejenuhan informasi it:Sovraccarico cognitivo he:היצף מידע ja:情報オーバーロード pl:Przeciążenie informacją fi:Informaatioähky th:ภาวะข้อมูลท่วมท้น zh:資訊超載 ru:Информационная перегрузка
