[ History and growth ] [ List of tallest buildings in Bellevue, Washington ] Bellevue was founded in 1869 by William Meydenbauer and was officially incorporated on March 21, 1953. Prior to the opening of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge in 1940, Bellevue was a rural area with little development. Although it was small, developers were pushing to change that; in the 1920s, James S. Ditty predicted that it would become a city with a population of 200,000. { Welch, Bob. Bellevue and the New Eastside a Contemporary Portrait. Chatsworth: Windsor Publications, 1989. ISBN 0-89781-331-6. } He envisioned plans that included the bridging of Lake Washington and an area filled with golf courses and airports. His map with these visions was published in 1928. { Lutz, Brian. &apos;&apos;The Sledgehammer – Version 2.0&apos;&apos; January 11, 2010 &apos;&apos;This Was the Future of Bellevue In 1928&apos;&apos;. } Once the Murrow Memorial Bridge opened, access from Seattle improved, and the area gradually grew into a bedroom community. [ http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id%3D313 Bellevue -- Thumbnail History HistoryLink 1998-11-09 Stein Alan J. 2008-06-09 ] Bellevue seen from Meydenbauer Bay in 1902 Following the 1963 opening of a second bridge across the lake, the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, the city began to grow more rapidly. It has since become one of the largest cities in the state, with several high-rise structures in its core and a burgeoning business community. Reflective of Bellevue&apos;s growth over the years is Bellevue Square, now one of the largest shopping center s in the region. Opened in 1946, Bellevue Square underwent a significant expansion in the 1980s. More recently, an expansion to Bellevue Square along Bellevue Way called &quot; The Lodge &quot; and the new One Lincoln Tower promise to strengthen downtown Bellevue&apos;s role as the largest Seattle Eastside shopping and dining destination. The city&apos;s long-term plans include the Bel-Red Corridor Project, a large-scale planning effort to encourage the redevelopment of a large northern section of the city bordering the adjacent town of Redmond. [ http://www.ci.bellevue.wa.us/bel-red_intro.htm Bel-Red Area Transformation City of Bellevue 2008-07-18 ] Patterned after what many civic leaders consider the successful redevelopment of the downtown core, early plans include &quot; superblock &quot; mixed use projects similar to Lincoln Square. Premised on the 2008 approval of the extension of Link Light Rail to the Eastside, the city hopes to mitigate transportation problems impeding earlier efforts in redeveloping the downtown core; viewed as an economic development opportunity by many in the business and building development community, the process has focused on infrastructure and the encouragement of private construction in a large-scale urban renewal effort. [ Geography ] Bellevue is located at [ 47.61 -122.2 type:city_region:US dms inline ] (47.597554, -122.159245). [ 1 ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 33.9  square miles (87.8  km 2 ), of which, 30.8  square miles (79.6  km 2 ) of it is land and 3.2  square miles (8.2  km 2 ) of it (9.29%) is water. The city&apos;s name is derived from a French term for &quot; beautiful view &quot;. Under favorable weather conditions, scenic vistas of the Olympic Mountains and Cascade Mountains can be viewed from hilltops (and strategically positioned high-rise buildings) within the incorporated city. The city lies between Lake Washington to the west and the smaller Lake Sammamish to the east. Much of Bellevue is drained by the Kelsey Creek watershed, whose source is located in the Larsen and Phantom Lake green belt and whose outlet is near where Interstate 90 meets Lake Washington&apos;s eastern shore. The city is bisected by Interstate 405 running north-south, and the southern portion is crossed from west to east by Interstate 90. The State Route 520 freeway roughly delineates the upper reaches of Bellevue. South of I-90 the city surrounds an unincorporated part of King County called Eastgate. South of Eastgate, the city continues up Cougar Mountain. On top of Cougar Mountain, there is another unincorporated King County island called Hilltop. To the west of Cougar Mountain, Bellevue includes the Coal Creek and Factoria neighborhoods. Bellevue is bordered by the cities of Kirkland to the north and Redmond to the northeast along the Overlake and Crossroads neighborhoods. Across the short East Channel Bridge, I-90 connects Bellevue to Mercer Island to the southwest. Issaquah is to the east, down I-90 at the south end of Lake Sammamish. The city is also bordered to the west by the suburbs of Medina, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point and Yarrow Point. The south end of Bellevue is bordered by the city of Renton, and to the southeast, the relatively recently incorporated city of Newcastle. [ Cityscape ] Communities within Bellevue include Bridle Trails, Crossroads, Eastgate /Cougar Mountain, Factoria, Newport, Northeast Bellevue, Northwest Bellevue, Sammamish/East Bellevue, Somerset, Sunset, West Bellevue, West Lake Hills, Wilburton, and Woodridge. { &quot; ls_nep400.jpg. &quot; City of Bellevue.

The Bellevue Transit Center, which serves both Metro and Sound buses, is located in the heart of the downtown business district and is connected to Interstate 405 by NE 6th St. and a direct-access Texas T HOV ramp. Local buses run into Kirkland, Redmond, Issaquah, Renton, and the University District; { http://transit.metrokc.gov/up/sc/rideralert/ra-022008-bellevuetc.html } [ June 2011 ] regional buses go to Bothell, Lynnwood, Everett, Seattle, Renton, Kent and Auburn, among other cities. { http://www.soundtransit.org/x1272.xml } [ June 2011 ] The East Link light rail line is planned to run from Seattle through Mercer Island and Bellevue before ending in Redmond. A measure including this and other regional road and transit projects went before voters on November 4, 2008 and was approved. However, the financial uncertainty of the area&apos;s other numerous transportation projects reflect the political fragmentation of the Puget Sound area. What is becoming apparent are the increasing costs associated with the central Puget Sound&apos;s regional transportation infrastructure. { http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/Viaduct/CostEstimates/ } [ June 2011 ] The Bellevue City Council has lobbied hard for Sound Transit—a regional transit authority—to construct its light-rail line underground through Bellevue&apos;s rapidly growing downtown. { Hicks, Joshua Adam (2010-03-23). &quot; Bellevue City Council unanimous on new downtown light-rail tunnel &quot;. Bellevue Reporter. Retrieved 2011-06-08. } But the cost of doing so would exceed the budget that voters approved for that project. Sound Transit has agreed to keep the tunnel option in play during the final phases of design, and Bellevue promised to devote between $104 million to $150 million toward a potential tunnel in the form of cash, services, free access to rights-of-way and one-time tax revenues that result from the East Link project. Bellevue City Council member Claudia Balducci is a member of the Sound Transit board of directors. The City of Bellevue has undertaken an extensive &quot; Bel-Red Area Transformation &quot; process which seeks to plan some [ 900 acre km2 ] in the northern portion of the city, { &quot; Bel-Red Area Transformation &quot;.

Bellevue is also served by a railroad, a Burlington Northern branch line known as the Woodinville Subdivision, which includes the historic Wilburton Trestle. This local freight line is the subject of debate over whether to railbank the line and construct a multi-purpose trail. As of March 2009, the Port of Seattle had to postpone its acquisition of the corridor because of instability in the bond market. [ Government and politics ] Bellevue City Hall Bellevue has a Council-Manager form of government with seven, non-partisan council members elected at large for staggered four-year terms. { City of Bellevue, Municipal Research and Service Center of Washington } The City Council selects a Mayor from among its members, who serves as council chair but has no veto power. As of 2010, the mayor is Don Davidson, the Deputy Mayor is Conrad Lee and the city&apos;s manager is Steve Sarkozy. The position of Mayor is largely ceremonial in Bellevue as the City Manager runs the City&apos;s day-to-day operations. The mayor runs council meetings, helps choose the issues that get on the council&apos;s meeting agendas, and serves as the city&apos;s most visible spokesperson. The position of Mayor is part-time. In practice, operational authority is held by the City Manager, the position that supervises an employee/consultant form of municipal authority. Indeed, more consideration is given the selection of City Manager than many candidates for City Council, the position of Mayor is elected not by popular vote but by the seven members of Council.
