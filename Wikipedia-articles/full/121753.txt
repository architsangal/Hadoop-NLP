The population was 9,414 at the 2010 census. A suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, it has been the only city in the county to report population growth as much of the area&apos;s residential and commercial expansion occurs there. Hermantown is located near the tip of Lake Superior. The eastern section of the city has an appearance typical of a lower-density bedroom community, with large, leafy lots and occasional subdivisions. The car-oriented &quot; Miller Hill area &quot;, or Miller Trunk Corridor of Duluth, has sprawled well past the border into this part of Hermantown. The western part is dominated by a more rural landscape, reminiscent of the past agricultural focus of the city. Hermantown&apos;s motto is &quot; The City of Quality Living &quot;. One of Hermantown&apos;s more interesting features is the proliferation of &quot; Jackson Homes &quot; on certain roads. These single-family dwellings were built during the Great Depression as subsistence homesteads. Many today retain their original brick appearance, albeit with additions. Hermantown&apos;s current mayor is Wayne Boucher, who won a 2008 election against opponent Susie Stockinger. [ History ] Hermantown&apos;s population would get a boost from a new wave of homesteaders just before World War II. During the hard times of the Great Depression, the federal government built nearly a hundred &quot; subsistence homestead &quot; projects designed to move people trapped in poverty in the cities, to new homes in rural or suburban locations. One of the two Minnesota projects was assigned to Hermantown The Jackson Project was completed in 1937. Each of the 84 homesteads had a brick veneer farmhouse; half also had a garage-barn combination. Each had five or [ 10 acre m2 ] of land, and the family also received a pig, a cow, and 35 chicken s. The idea was that the family would be able to raise its own food and use the profits from selling any surplus to work off its debt to the government. The units were sold to homesteaders on very liberal terms: the average price for the home and property was $2,687.40 plus interest. The Hermantown project was one of the later projects built, which was a benefit because the quality of housing improved. Plumbing and electricity were now required in all homes. The homesteaders gave a whole new profile to the Town of Herman. Now with 84 homes and families concentrated in one part of the community, the Project marked the start of a transition from rural to suburban for Hermantown. Hermantown was incorporated as a city on December 31, 1975. The community of Adolph is located within the city of Hermantown. On November 10, 2008, Hermantown experienced the first homicide in its history. A 20-year old male was taken into custody, but his victim, a 27-year old male, died from multiple stab wounds on his way to the hospital. { http://www.wdio.com/article/stories/s656287.shtml?cat=10335 } [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 34.3 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 34.3 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and [ 0.04 sqmi km2 ] of it (0.06%) is water.
