[ History ] The airport was originally constructed in 1942 by the United States Army Air Forces as a training base for Air Corps Flying Training Command. Gulfport Army Airfield opened on 7 July, and the Eastern Technical Training Command conducted technical training and basic training until transferred to Third Air Force on 31 March 1944 with joint use by Technical Training Command for marine training of Emergency Rescue School (3d Air Rescue Group) located at Keesler Army Airbase. Under Second Air Force, the 328th Army Air Force Base Unit conducted replacement training for heavy bomber ( B-17 Flying Fortress, B-24 Liberator ) units. In addition B-29 Superfortress aircrew transition training was performed. With the end of the war and the drawdown of the military, Gulfport AAF was placed into reserve status on 31 January 1946. Gulfport Field was declared excess by the Air Force and conveyed by the War Assets Administration to the City of Gulfport in 1949 for use as a civil airport. The City negotiated airline service contracts with Southern Airways and later National Airlines to provide passenger and cargo service beginning in the early 1950s. Due to the large expansion of the United States Air Force as a result of the Cold War, a new lease was obtained for military use of the airport and Gulfport Air Force Base was opened as a joint-use civil/military facility. Improvements were made by the Air Force to the field to bring the wartime facilities up to permanent Air Force standards. On 16 July 1951. Gulfport Air Force Base was activated and assigned to the Air Training Command (ATC) and was made the headquarters of the new Technical Training Air Force (TTAF), which controlled technical and basic training of Air Force personnel. The TTAF controlled 10 Air Force wings from Gulfport: 7 Technical Training wings: 3310th, Scott AFB, Illinois 3320th, Amarillo AFB, Texas 3345th, Chanute AFB, Illinois 3380th, Keesler AFB, Mississippi 3415th, Lowry AFB, Colorado 3450th, Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming 3750th, Sheppard AFB, Texas 1 USAF Recruiting Wing: 3500th, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 1 USAF Military Basic Training Wing: 3700th, Lackland AFB, Texas 1 USAF Mobile Training Wing: 3499th, Chanute AFB, Illinois In addition, contract basic flying training was conducted at Gulfport. In 1957, ATC decided to assign all flying and crew training responsibilities under a single headquarters. In addition, effective 1 July 1958, the command discontinued the Technical Training Air Force and moved all training headquarters to their controlling major commands or to ATC, depending on its mission. Recruiting and Basic Training were also reassigned to HQ ATC. Gulfport AFB was closed as an active Air Force installation and its military facilities were transferred to the Mississippi Air National Guard, with the airport remaining a joint-use airport and Air National Guard base. Through the late 1970s, Southern Airways continued as the primary airline, followed by successors Republic Airlines and Northwest Airlines into the 1990s. Beginning in 1953, the Mississippi Air National Guard developed a training activity which has grown into a high-tech Combat Readiness Training Center, one of four in the Nation. Military traffic has expanded each year, and now more than 20,000 Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve flight personnel are trained at the base annually. Within 10 minutes, supersonic fighters and in-flight refuelers can simulate a combat environment over the Gulf of Mexico or at Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg, MS. Additionally, the Army National Guard established the Aviation Classification Repair Depot operation which repairs several types of combat and transport helicopters for military activities throughout the Southeast and Puerto Rico.
