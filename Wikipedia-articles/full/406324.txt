[ May 2012 ] thumb Airline deregulation is the process of removing governmental imposed entry and price restrictions on airlines affecting, in particular, the carriers permitted to serve specific routes. In the United States, the term usually applies to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. A new form of regulation has been developed to some extent to deal with problems such as the allocation of the limited number of slots available at airports. [ Introduction ] Airline services were historically heavily regulated, in part because of concerns about monopoly and oligopoly arising from the fact that in most cases, only a small number of airlines provided direct flights between a given &quot; city pair &quot;. In the U.S., the airline deregulation began in 1978. It was a part of a sweeping reduction in price and entry controls in United States transportation begun with initiatives in the Nixon Administration, carried out through the Ford and Carter Administrations, and followed up on in the Reagan Administration. Many other countries have since deregulated their domestic markets, [ April 2010 ] and a similar process has applied to airline markets within the European Union. Many international airline markets remain subject to regulation. [ April 2010 ] [ Airline deregulation in the United States ] Although federal regulation of the airline industry can be traced to the Air Mail Act of 1925 and the Air Commerce Act of 1926, serious economic regulation of commercial aviation began with passage of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. This Act created the Civil Aeronautics Authority, which became the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), and gave the CAB the power to regulate airline routes, control entry to and exit from the market, and mandate service rates. Airline safety regulation would come much later with passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which created the Federal Aviation Administration. [ Civil Aeronautics Board ] [ Civil Aeronautics Board ] In 1938 the U.S. government, through the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), regulated many areas of commercial aviation such as routes, fares and schedules. The CAB had three main functions: to award routes to airlines, to limit the entry of air carriers into new markets, and to regulate fares for passengers. Much of the established practices of commercial passenger travel within the US, went back even farther, to the policies of W. F. Brown, the US postmaster general in the 1920s and early 1930s in the administration of President H. Hoover. Brown had changed the mail payments system to encourage the manufacture of passenger aircraft instead of mail carrying aircraft. His influence was crucial in awarding contracts so as to create four major domestic airlines: United, American, Eastern, and Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA). Similarly, Brown had also helped give Pan American a monopoly on international routes. (See also the US Centennial of Flight Commission ) Typical regulatory thinking from the 1940s onward is evident in a Civil Aeronautics Board report. In the absence of particular circumstances presenting an affirmative reason for a new carrier, there appears to be no inherent desirability of increasing the present number of carriers merely for the purpose of numerically enlarging the industry. [ April 2010 ] [ Airline Deregulation Act ] [ Airline Deregulation Act ] The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 removed many of the previously mentioned controls. Prior to deregulation, it was required that airlines first seek regulatory approval to serve any given route. Thus incumbent airline operators could raise barriers to the challenge of new competition. This system was dismantled as a result of the Airline Deregulation Act. (See also the US Centennial of Flight Commission ) It also dismantled the notion of a flag carrier. What&apos;s taken its place is the extremely aggressive free-trade practice of loss leader strategy. A tactic wherein a company, which already dominates that market, will lower fares below cost in order to force any new competitors out of business. { www.enotes.com } [ Open Skies ] Open Skies agreements are bilateral agreements between the US and other countries to open the aviation market to foreign access and remove barriers to competition. They give airlines the right to operate air services from any point in the US to any point in the other country, as well as to and from third countries. The U.S. has Open Skies agreements with more than 60 countries, including fifteen of the 25 EU nations. Open Skies agreements have been successful at removing many of the government implemented barriers to competition and allowing airlines to have foreign partners, [ April 2010 ] access to international routes to and from their home countries and freedom from many traditional forms of economic regulation. [ April 2010 ] A global industry would work better with a globally minded set of rules that would allow airlines from one country to establish airlines in another country and to operate domestic services in the territory of another country. These agreements still fail to approximate the freedoms that most industries have when competing in other global markets. { Smith Jr F. L., Cox B., Airline Deregulation, The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, Liberty Fund Inc, 2. Edition, 2007 } As jets were integrated into the market in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the industry experienced dramatic growth. By the mid-1960s, they were carrying roughly 100 million passengers and by the mid 1970s, over 200 million Americans had traveled by air. [ http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_37.html Table 1-37: U.S. Air Carrier Aircraft Departures, Enplaned Revenue Passengers, and Enplaned Revenue Tons ] This steady increase in air travel began placing serious strains on the ability of federal regulators to cope with the increasingly complex nature of air travel. The onset of high inflation, low economic growth, falling productivity, rising labor costs and higher fuel costs proved problematic to the airlines. { Thierer, A. D. 1998, 20th Anniversary of Airline Deregulation:Cause for Celebration, Not Re-Regulation, The Heritage Foundation, } [ Hub and spoke networks ] After deregulation, the airlines quickly moved to a hub-and-spoke system, whereby an airline selected some airport, the hub, as the destination point for flights from a number of origination cities, the spokes. Because the size of the planes used varied according to the travel on that spoke, and since hubs allowed passenger travel to be consolidated in “transfer stations”, capacity utilization increased, [ April 2010 ] allowing fare reduction. The hub-and-spoke model survives among the legacy carriers, but the low-cost carriers (LCCs), now 30 percent of the market, typically fly point to point. The network hubs model offers consumers more convenience for routes, but point-to-point routes have proven less costly for airlines to implement. Over time, the legacy carriers and the LCCs will likely use some combination of point to point and network hubs to capture both economies of scope and pricing advantages. [ Impact ] [ Price ] Prices have declined steadily since deregulation. Quoting the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, &quot; The inflation adjusted 1982 constant dollar yield for airlines has fallen from 12.3 cents in 1978 to 7.9 cents in 1997. This means that airline ticket prices are almost 40% lower today than they were in 1978 when the airlines were deregulated. &quot; { The Heritage foundation } Along with rising US. populations { &quot; US Census Bureau &quot; } and the increasing demand of work-force-mobility, these trends were some of the catalysts for dramatic expansion in passenger miles flown, increasing from 250 million passenger miles in 1978 to 750 million passenger miles in 2005. [ Service quality ] The quality of airline service can be measured in many different ways, including the number of aircraft departures, the total number of miles flown, seating comfort, aesthetic appearance of cabin crew, the timeliness of service, other programs and services, and various frills or amenities. It would appear that one of the greatest hallmarks and battle-cries of deregulation; improved services, has plainly failed. Over the past several years the public&apos;s view of airline service quality has shown a significant drop. { Johnsson, Julie, Airline industry the worst in customer ratings, Chicago Tribune, May 20, 2008, } According to the 2008 American Customer Satisfaction Index, a University of Michigan study of 80,000 consumers’ expectations and preferences, the major US airlines ranked last among all the industries surveyed. In 2009, the airlines have moved up to being one point ahead of Cable &amp; Satellite TV and the newspaper industry (though results for all industries were not available at the time of this writing). { American Customer Satisfaction Index, Scores by Industry, Sep 14, 2009 } In 2011 congress finally responded to repeated calls for the United States government to pass an &quot; Air Passenger Bill of Rights &quot; to provide specific requirements about what must happen to air passengers in certain conditions. { Martin, Hugo, Support is growing for a fliers&apos; bill of rights, Sep 12, 2009, } The push for the bill stemmed from several high profile passenger strandings over the last several years. On April 25, 2011, the Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections, &quot; 76 Federal Regulation 23110 &quot; rule was enacted. [ Sweeping Customer Protection Regulations http://www.jonesday.com/us-department-of-transportation-sets-airline-customer-service-standards-with-stringent-new-rules-on-us-and-foreign-carriers-05-05-2011/ 23 May 2012 Jones Day Publications May 2011 ] Amongst other items, the rule includes raising the minimum &quot; denied boarding compensation &quot; to customers with valid tickets yet still not allowed to board the aircraft. The legislation further penalizes airlines up to $27,500 a passenger if left stranded aboard an aircraft, on a tarmac for more than three hours. [ Cameron Doug American Eagle Incurs First Fine http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204190504577038012670211508.html 22 May 2012 The Wall Street Journal Nov, 15th 2011 ] In 2010, the largest trade associations representing airline management interests before Capitol Hill, Airlines for America and the Regional Airline Association, opposed this legislation stating that they could self-regulate themselves and they already had begun implementing systems by which to mitigate any tarmac delays. [ RAA Objects to EAPR http://www.raa.org/Portals/0/FayeGovtPage/FINAL%20-%20RAA%20Comments%20on%20Enhancing%20Passenger%20Protections%20NPRM092310.pdf 22 May 2012 RAA.org Sept 23, 2010 ] [ Berg David A. A4A Fights New Passenger Protection Rules http://www.airlines.org/Documents/PaxProtectionsFinal.pdf Airlines for America 23 May 2012 ] Later American Eagle, an RAA airline member, was the first airline to be fined under the new legislation. A total settlement including fines and compensation paid to passengers totaled $800,000 for tarmac delays incurred in Chicago in May of 2011. [ Problems and controversy ] The purpose behind government regulation is to create a stable industry. [ Kaps Robert W. Air Transport Labor Relations 1997 Southern Illinois University Press 0-80-93-1776-1 ] The number of major carriers in the United States fell from six in 1978 (United, American, Delta, Eastern, TWA, and Pan Am) to three by 1991 (United, American, and Delta). Since the year 2000 every major airline has filed for bankruptcy at least once. US Airways has filed twice in the same number of years. [ Epidemic of Bankruptcy http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2011/11/29/american_joins_long_list_of_airline_bankruptcies/ 23 May 2012 Associated Press Nov. 29th 2011 ] The destabilizing effects of privatization were felt immediately and have become worse as time has passed. Although finding solutions to some problems, airline deregulation has created strongly polarizing results. Along with a 40% drop in airfares since deregulation in 1978, airline employees have seen up to a 40% drop in income, affecting approximately 545,000 American workers. { Global Airline Industry Program - Massachusetts Institute of Technology } Although the gains of economic liberalization have been substantial for the traveling public and airline executives, { P. Ling &apos;&apos;Airline CEO Compensation Round Up&apos;&apos;, May 4th 2010 } fundamental problems brought on by deregulation continue to plague the industry and its workers. Even though it&apos;s been more than thirty years since deregulation, some of these massive adjustments imposed at the end of a half century of regulation are still being considered transitional problems in their effect by the champions of privatization. Before deregulation, airline oligopolies received returns on capital that were profitable for the company, its executives and its employees, but these returns factored in costs that would not necessarily exist in a competitive market. [ April 2010 ] For example, the airlines&apos; unionized workforce, strengthened under regulation and held in place by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), protected worker salaries, keeping them commensurate to the level of education, experience, risk-factor and time away from home. Instead of a traditional lockout, since deregulation airline executive management has used the laws of bankruptcy as an &quot; ultimate weapon &quot;. [ Kaps Robert W. Air Transport Labor Relations 1997 Southern Illinois University Press 0-80-93-1776-1 ] Labor unions view this as union-busting, allowing management to throw out contracts already agreed upon while still receiving exorbitant bonuses themselves, regardless of work quality. { The Economist, Feb 7, 2012. } In doing so, airline executive management has created what many are calling the great race to the bottom { Armstrong Williams, The Washington Times, Dec 26th 2011 } with one company filing for bankruptcy after the next, leaving only those who have not paying their employes what was contractually agreed upon. { United Federation of Teachers &apos;&apos;Bankruptcy is newest union-busting tool&apos;&apos;, March 5th 2012 } Captain Chesley Sullenberger, hero of The Miracle on the Hudson Thus, former airline pilot and hero of The miracle on the hudson, Chesley Sullenberger, has argued before the United States Congress that the U.S. is beginning to realize an industry wide brain drain from the occupation of airline transport pilot. { Katharine Zaleski Chesley &quot; Sully &quot; Sullenberger To Congress: My Pay Has Been Cut 40 Percent In Recent Years, Pension Terminated, March 22, 2009 } Adding that: [ I don&apos;t know a single professional pilot who would recommend that their children follow in their footsteps. Katie Couric, June 12, 2009., CBS News. For the last six years, I have worked seven days a week between my two jobs just to maintain a middle class standard of living. HuffPost, Politics, May 25th, 2011. Bankruptcies were used by some as a fishing expedition to get what they could not get in normal times. HuffPost, Politics, May 25th, 2011. ]. Various solutions have been proposed, including, for the first time since 1978, federal control over some of the prices charged and routes served by major airlines { Poole, R. W. Jr., Butler V., Airline Deregulation: The Unfinished Revolution, December 1998. } with a view of increasing price and cost competition. [ http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI%3D80140100965480 Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009 Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees Cornell University Press, Ithaca 5 ] Ultimately deregulation has certainly provided some financial benefits to the average air traveler. Economists from the Brookings Institution { Brookings Institution }, a conservative think tank, [ A title of Liberal is a Win for Conservatives http://www.fair.org/index.php?page%3D1436 Fair.org 23 May 2012 ] and George Mason University { George Mason university } have proven that indeed consumers save thanks to the lower fares resulting from a competitive airline marketplace. Specifically: [ The Failure of FAA Regulation Paul A. Cleveland And Jared R. Price http://mises.org/pdf/asc/2002/ASC8-Cleveland-Price.pdf ] [ In the decade after this partial decontrol, employment in the industry grew by 32 percent and passenger travel increased by 55 percent. Along with these increases, the real cost of travel dropped by about 17 percent on the major routes and by somewhat less in smaller markets. The second decade after this deregulation brought even more benefits, with ticket prices more than 20 percent lower in real terms and total passengers served up from 275 million to 600 million since 1978. Consumers saved some $19.4 billion per year thanks to the lower fares brought about by a more competitive marketplace. ] [ Cleveland &amp; Price The Failure of FAA Regulation http://mises.org/pdf/asc/2002/ASC8-Cleveland-Price.pdf George Masson University 23 May 2012 ] - Taken from the Cleveland &amp; Price Study, 1999 Conversely, in a June 2008 former CEO of American Airlines, Robert Crandall stated, [ The consequences of deregulation have been very adverse. Our airlines, once world leaders, are now laggards in every category, including fleet age, service quality and international reputation. Fewer and fewer flights are on time. Airport congestion has become a staple of late-night comedy shows. An even higher percentage of bags are lost or misplaced. Last-minute seats are harder and harder to find. Passenger complaints have skyrocketed. Airline service, by any standard, has become unacceptable. Bill McGee, March 2008., USA Today. ] [ Successful Airline deregulation in Europe ] The economic liberalisation of air travel was part of a series of deregulation moves based on the growing realization that a politically controlled economy served no continuing public interest. U.S. deregulation has been part of a greater global airline liberalization trend, especially in Asia, Latin America, and the EU. The effects of liberalization in Europe are undoubtedly quite different in scope and magnitude than in the US. When the architects of the European Union were devising ways to bring the continent’s nations closer together, they probably didn’t think much about airlines. But few businesses have contributed more to cross-border interaction among Europe’s 450m citizens. From 1993 to 1997, the European Union phased in a continent-wide open skies regime that’s dramatically lowered fares, expanded access and boosted tourism, commerce and movement within the now 25-member market. Perhaps most remarkably, these developments haven’t ravaged the fortunes of employees or destroyed the financial performance of airlines to the same degree they have in North America. While airlines like Sabena have died and workers like those at Swissair suffered, many of the continent’s largest airlines avoided the sweeping restructuring that their American counterparts are still undertaking. Many carriers are hiring and both legacy and low-cost airlines are making money. In many ways, Europe is a dream market for airlines. Average household incomes are high, workers receive long holiday breaks and high petrol taxes encourage people to travel by air rather than car. Moreover, the continent is dotted with culturally-rich cities that tourists love to visit and pleasant-weather beaches that crowd with vacationers during summers. Many Europeans even have second homes in other E.U. countries. No group of airlines has better taken advantage of these favorable market characteristics than the low-cost carriers spawned by deregulation. Not all are profitable or sustainable—as many as 60 still exist in various niches throughout the continent—but the biggest and the best are carrying enormous volumes of traffic. The European Low-Fares Airline Association, an advocacy group, says Europe’s LCCs now transport more than 100m passengers a year, about as many as American Airlines. And many LCCs serve a large number of cities. { Airline Weekly, June 12th, 2006 } [ Notes ] [ References ] Bailey, E.
