Internationally, [ Kos ] of the United Nation&apos;s 193 member states (including a majority of European countries) have recognised Kosovo&apos;s independence.

Farid Zarif, an Afghan diplomat, has been the SRSG since 11 October 2011. [ Structure ] UNMIK has been divided into four sections which it calls &quot; pillars. &quot; These are: Pillar I: Police and justice (United Nations-led) www.unmikonline.org UNMIK &gt; Pillar I &gt; Police &gt; CIVPOL. Retrieved 2010-06-16. Pillar II: Civil Administration (United Nations-led) Pillar III: Democratization and institution building (led by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ) Pillar IV: Reconstruction and economic development ( European Union -led) Responsibility for enforcement of Pillars I and II has now been transferred to the institutions of provisional self-government in Kosovo. The UN, however, still monitors this enforcement. Following a major internal restructuring of its activities, this Pillar structure underwent a change. Pillar I was dissolved causing Police Commissioner and the Director of the Department of Justice to report to SRSG instead of DSRSG as previously. Pillar II was reduced to a Department of Civil Administration and its Director also reporting directly to the SRSG. UNMIK oversees a substantial UN International Police force numbered at approximately 1,985 including Formed Police Units. A NATO -led force called KFOR provides an international security presence in support of UNMIK&apos;s work, but is not subordinate to the UN. The European Union led economic development includes the privatisation of former government enterprises.

Kosovo Albanians displaced from the divided town of Mitrovica have yet to be granted the right to return. Amongst other things, according to SC Resolution 1244, Serbia is authorised to send a specific amount of its troops back into Kosovo. UNMIK so far has prevented Serbia from doing so, thus in fact breaching the resolution. Illegal Serb intelligence and interior forces continue to operate clandestinely in Kosovo, especially in the north; Since the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in 1999, according to some international organizations Kosovo has become a major destination country for women and young girls trafficked into forced prostitution.

According to Amnesty International, most of these women are trafficked from Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine. On 10 February 2007 UN police fired rubber bullets at unarmed demonstrators in Pristina, killing two and injuring 82. The Chief Constable resigned, however the police unit which fired the rubber bullets returned to Rumania where they have not been investigated. Meanwhile in Pristina, UNMIK arrested and detained the demonstration organiser, Albin Kurti of VETËVENDOSJE! (Albanian for self-determination). He remained in detention without trial until July 2007 and subsequently has been under house arrest. Amnesty International has criticised UNMIK&apos;s conduct of his prosecution. In June 2005, a BBC article suggested that the European Roma Rights Centre were to sue UNMIK over the treatment of Roma refugees. In July 2006, a book, &apos;Peace at Any Price: How the World Failed Kosovo&apos;, written by two former senior staffers at UNMIK, exposed a catalogue of errors and incompetence in the institution over its seven year history. [ Kosovo final status process ] [ Kosovo status process ] [ Constitutional status of Kosovo ] [ 2005 ] A UN-led political process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo&apos;s future status. Belgrade proposed that Kosovo be highly autonomous and remain a part of Serbia — Belgrade officials repeatedly said that an imposition of Kosovo&apos;s independence would be a violation of Serbia&apos;s sovereignty and therefore contrary to international law and the UN Charter. Representatives of Kosovo&apos;s ethnic-Albanian majority asserted that Kosovo must become independent, arguing that the violence of the Milošević years made continued union between Kosovo and Serbia impossible. UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, a former president of Finland, leads the status process with Austria n diplomat Albert Rohan, his deputy. Ahtisaari&apos;s office — the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK) — is located in Vienna and includes liaison staff from NATO, the European Union and the United States. [ 2006 ] The initial status negotiations focused on technical issues important for Kosovo&apos;s long-term stability, particularly the rights and protection of Kosovo&apos;s minorities (and especially the Kosovo Serbs). Ahtisaari brought the parties together for the first direct dialogue in February 2006 to discuss decentralization of local government, an important measure in the protection of Kosovo Serb communities. Subsequent meetings addressed economic issues, property rights, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional guarantees for the rights of Kosovo&apos;s minorities. On 24 July 2006, Ahtisaari brought the parties together in Vienna for the first high-level talks on the status outcome itself. Serbian President Boris Tadić, Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim Çeku attended and presented their respective platforms for Kosovo&apos;s future status. Ahtisaari later told the press that the meeting resulted in no breakthroughs, but added that the discussion was &quot; frank and candid &quot; and the atmosphere was better than he could have expected. { &quot; Serbian, Kosovo Albanian talks fail to reach breakthrough on future status &quot; } { Agence France-Presse (AFP), Vienna, 24 July 2006. } Ahtisaari briefed Contact Group foreign ministers on 20 September 2006, in New York City at a meeting chaired by U.S. Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. At that meeting, the Contact Group released a press statement that reaffirmed its desire to work towards a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006 and also endorsed Ahtisaari&apos;s plans to develop a comprehensive proposal for a status settlement.

The proposal covered a wide range of issues related to Kosovo&apos;s future, in particular measures to protect Kosovo&apos;s non-Albanian communities such as decentralization of government, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional protections for non-Albanian communities, which would remain in place for at least three years. Whilst not mentioning the word &quot; independence, &quot; the draft included several provisions that were widely interpreted as implying statehood for Kosovo. In particular, the draft Settlement would give Kosovo the right to apply for membership in international organizations, to create a Kosovo Security Force and adopt national symbols.

After this meeting, leaders from both sides signalled a total unwillingness to compromise on their central demands (Kosovo Albanians for Kosovo&apos;s independence; Belgrade for continued sovereignty over Kosovo). Concluding that there was little hope of the two sides reconciling their positions independently, Ahtisaari said he would submit to the UN Security Council his own proposed status arrangements, including an explicit recommendation for the status outcome itself, by the end of March.
