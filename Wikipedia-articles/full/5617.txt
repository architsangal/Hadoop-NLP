When brain tissue from a CJD patient is examined under a microscope, many tiny holes can be seen where whole areas of nerve cells have died. The word &quot; spongiform &quot; in &quot; transmissible spongiform encephalopathies &quot; refers to the sponge-like appearance of the brain tissue. [ Cause ] Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases are caused by prion s. The diseases are thus sometimes called prion diseases. Other prion diseases include Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome (GSS), fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and kuru in humans, as well as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease) in cattle, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in elk and deer, and scrapie in sheep. Alpers&apos; syndrome in infants is also thought to be a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by a prion. [ Chakraborty C, Nandi S, Jana S Prion disease: a deadly disease for protein misfolding Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology 6 2 167–77 2005 April 15853695 10.2174/1389201053642321 ] [ Obi RK, Nwanebu FC 2008 Prions And Prion Diseases African Journal of Clinical and Experimental Microbiology 9 1 38–52 1595-689X http://ajol.info/index.php/ajcem/article/view/7481 2009-06-20 ] The prion that is believed to cause Creutzfeldt –Jakob exhibits at least two stable conformations. One, the native state, is water-soluble and present in healthy cells. [ 2007 ], its biological function is presumably in transmembrane transport or signaling. The other conformational state is relatively water-insoluble and readily forms protein aggregates. People can also acquire CJD genetically through a mutation of the gene that codes for the prion protein (PRNP).This occurs in only 5–10% of all CJD cases. The CJD prion is dangerous because it promotes refolding of native proteins into the diseased state [ 21915360 International Journal of Molecular Epidemiology and Genetics Mackay Knight Ironside Graham A Richard SG James W 2011 2(3) The molecular epidemiology of variant CJD 3 217–27 3166149 ] The number of misfolded protein molecules will increase exponentially and the process leads to a large quantity of insoluble protein in affected cells. This mass of misfolded proteins disrupts cell function and causes cell death. Mutations in the gene for the prion protein can cause a misfolding of the dominantly alpha helical regions into beta pleated sheets. This change in conformation disables the ability of the protein to undergo digestion. Once the prion is transmitted, the defective proteins invade the brain and are produced in a self-sustaining feedback loop. Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1997 for his discovery of prions. For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been challenging this explanation for the disease. In January 2007, she and her colleagues published an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science and reported that they have found a virus -like particle (but without finding nucleic acid s so far) in less than 10% of the cells a scrapie-infected cell line and in a mouse cell line infected by a human CJD agent.

In the hereditary form, a mutation occurs in the gene for PrP, PRNP. Ten to 15 percent of CJD cases are inherited. (CDC) The disease has also been shown to result from use of Human Growth Hormone obtained from the pituitary gland s of persons who died from Creutzfeldt –Jakob Disease, [ Mills JL, Schonberger LB, Wysowski DK Long-term mortality in the United States cohort of pituitary-derived growth hormone recipients The Journal of Pediatrics 144 4 430–6 2004 April 15069388 10.1016/j.jpeds.2003.12.036 http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2004/04/62998 Wired 2004-04-09 ] though the known incidence of this cause is (as of April 2004) quite small. The risk of infection via cadaveric HGH in the US ceased when the medication was withdrawn in 1985. It is thought [ June 2011 ] that humans can contract the disease by consuming material from animals infected with the bovine form of the disease. The only suspected cases to arise thus far have been vCJD, although there are fears—based on animal studies [ Bruce M.E. Will R.G. Ironside J.W. McConnell I. Drummond D Suttie A. McCardle L. Chree A.

When BSE material infects humans, the resulting disease is known as (new) variant CJD (nvCJD). Cannibalism has also been implicated as a transmission mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as kuru, once found primarily among women and children of the Fore people in Papua New Guinea. While the men of the tribe ate the body of the deceased and rarely contracted the disease, the women and children, who ate the less desirable body parts, including the brain, were 8 times more likely than men to contract kuru from infected tissue. Prions, the infectious agent of CJD, may not be inactivated by means of routine surgical instrument sterilization procedures. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, it is recommended that heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976.

The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrP Sc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP Sc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so that it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP Sc after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP Sc could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of great value in surveillance as a blood or urine-based screening test for CJD.

[ Pfeifer A, Eigenbrod S, Al-Khadra S Lentivector-mediated RNAi efficiently suppresses prion protein and prolongs survival of scrapie-infected mice The Journal of Clinical Investigation 116 12 3204–10 2006 December 17143329 1679709 10.1172/JCI29236 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6198072.stm BBC News 2006-12-04 ] Both amphotericin B and doxorubicin have been investigated as potentially effective against CJD, but as yet there is no strong evidence that either drug is effective in stopping the disease. Further study has been taken with other medical drugs, but none are effective. However, drugs to reduce suffering do exist, and include Valproate, an anticonvulsant, and Clonazepam, to reduce muscle jerks. Dr. Michael Geschwind, Dr. Bruce Miller and Dr. Stanley Prusiner from University of California, San Francisco are currently running a treatment trial for sporadic CJD using quinacrine, a medicine originally created for malaria. Pilot studies showed quinacrine permanently cleared abnormal prion proteins from cell cultures, but results have not yet been published on the clinical study. [ Epidemiology ] Dark green areas are countries that have confirmed human cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and light green are countries that have bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases. Although CJD is the most common human prion disease, it is still rare, occurring in about one out of every one million people every year. It usually affects people aged 45–75, most commonly appearing in people between the ages of 60–65. The exception to this is the more recently-recognised &apos;variant&apos; CJD (vCJD), which occurs in younger people. CDC monitors the occurrence of CJD in the United States through periodic reviews of national mortality data. According to the CDC : [ August 2008 ] [ vCJD (Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/vcjd/factsheet_nvcjd.htm Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2007-01-04 2009-06-20 ] CJD occurs worldwide at a rate of about 1 case per million population per year. On the basis of mortality surveillance from 1979 to 1994, the annual incidence of CJD remained stable at approximately 1 case per million persons in the United States. In the United States, CJD deaths among persons younger than 30 years of age are extremely rare (fewer than five deaths per billion per year ). The disease is found most frequently in patients 55–65 years of age, but cases can occur in people older than 90 years and younger than 55 years of age. In more than 85% of cases, the duration of CJD is less than 1 year (median: four months) after onset of symptoms. [ New concerns ] In The Lancet (June 2006), a University College London team suggested that it may take more than 50 years for vCJD to develop, from their studies of kuru, a similar disease in Papua New Guinea. The reasoning behind the claim is that kuru was possibly transmitted through cannibalism in Papua New Guinea when family members would eat the body of a dead relative as a sign of mourning. In the 1950s, cannibalism was banned. In the late 20th century, however, kuru reached epidemic proportions in certain Papua New Guinean communities, therefore suggesting that vCJD may also have a similar incubation period of 30 to 50 years. A critique to this theory is that while mortuary cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, that does not necessarily mean that the practice ended. 15 years later Jared Diamond was informed by Papuans that the practice continued. [ Diamond JM 7 September 2000 Archaeology: Talk of cannibalism Nature 407 25–26 10.1038/35024175 25 ] Kuru may have passed to the Fore people through the preparation of the dead body for burial. These researchers noticed a genetic variation in some kuru patients that has been known to promote long incubation period s. They have also proposed that individuals who contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short incubation periods for Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This means that there may be many more vCJD patients who have longer incubation periods, which may surface many years later. [ Collinge J, Whitfield J, McKintosh E Kuru in the 21st century--an acquired human prion disease with very long incubation periods Lancet 367 9528 2068–74 2006 June 16798390 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68930-7 ] In 1997 a number of Kentuckian s developed CJD. It was discovered that all the victims had consumed squirrel brains, although a coincidental relationship between the disease and this dietary practice may have been involved. [ Berger JR, Waisman E, Weisman B Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and eating squirrel brains Lancet 350 9078 642 1997 August 9288058 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)63333-8 ] See: http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/03/bse.medicalresearch for recent concerns. [ History ] The disease was first described by German neurologist Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt in 1920 and shortly afterwards by Alfons Maria Jakob, giving it the name Creutzfeldt –Jakob. Some of the clinical findings described in their first papers do not match current criteria for Creutzfeldt –Jakob disease, and it has been speculated that at least two of the patients in initial studies were suffering from a different ailment. [ February 2009 ] An early description of familial CJD stems from the German psychiatrist and neurologist Friedrich Meggendorfer (1880–1953). { Meggendorfer F.
