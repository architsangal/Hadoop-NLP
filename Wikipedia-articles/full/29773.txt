Each player uses a racket that is strung to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over a net into the opponent&apos;s court. Object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a good return. [ http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf ITF Rules of Tennis – Rule 25 (A Good Return) ITF 5 May 2012 ] Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including people in wheelchairs. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England in the late 19th century as &quot; lawn tennis &quot; which has close connections to various field/lawn games as well as to the ancient game of real tennis. Up to then, &quot; tennis &quot; referred to the latter sport: for example, in Disraeli &apos;s novel Sybil (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will &quot; go down to Hampton Court and play tennis. As it is the Derby [classic horse race], nobody will be there &quot;. { Benjamin Disraeli (1845) Sybil, chapter 1 } After its creation, lawn tennis spread throughout the upper-class English-speaking population before spreading around the world. { History of Tennis. &quot; &quot; } The rules of tennis have not changed much since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tie-break in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a player to challenge the line (or chair) umpire&apos;s call of a point. Players have unlimited opportunities to challenge provided the challenges made are correct. However, once three incorrect challenges are made in a set, they cannot challenge again until the next set. If the set goes to a tie-break, players are given one additional opportunity to challenge the call. This electronic review, currently called Hawk-Eye, is available at a limited number of high-level ATP and WTA tournaments. Tennis is enjoyed by millions of recreational players and is also a hugely popular worldwide spectator sport, especially the four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the &quot; Majors &quot; ): the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open played also on hard courts.

Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume, which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis out of doors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris &quot; around the end of the 13th century &quot;. [ Newman Paul B. Daily life in the Middle Ages 2001 McFarland &amp; Co. Jefferson, N.C. 978-0-7864-0897-9 163 ] In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. Unfortunately, in June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of poisoning. [ Gillmeister Heiner Tennis : A Cultural History 1998 Leicester University Press London 978-0-7185-0195-2 17–21 Repr. ] Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history&apos;s first tennis player known by name. It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use, and the game began to be called &quot; tennis &quot;, from the Old French term Tenez, which can be translated as &quot; hold! &quot;, &quot; receive! &quot; or &quot; take! &quot;. An interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent. { Online Etymology Dictionary } It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis. { Crego, Robert.

She laid out a tennis court at the Staten Island Cricket Club at Camp Washington, Tompkinsville, New York. The first American National championship was played there in September 1880.

Each year, a grass-court tournament and an induction ceremony honoring new Hall of Fame members are hosted on its grounds. [ Equipment ] [ Tennis technology ] Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racquet and balls. [ Racquets ] A tennis racquet. The components of a tennis racquet include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, racquets were of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in racquets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability. Under modern rules of tennis, the racquet must adhere to the following guidelines; [ ITF Tennis – Technical – Appendix II http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/equipment/appendixii.asp ITF 4 May 2012 ] The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform. The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29  inches in length and 12.5  inches in width. The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the racquet. The racquet must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match. The rules regarding racquets have changed over time, as material and engineering advances have been made. For example, the maximum length of the frame had been 32  inches until 1997, when it was shortened to 29  inches. [ ITF Tennis – Technical – The Racket http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/history/racket.asp ITF 4 May 2012 ] [ Balls ] { Penn tennis ball. } [ Tennis ball ] Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant color was gradually changed to Optic Yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce criteria to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as 65.41-68.58  mm (2.575-2.700  inches). Balls must weigh between 56.0 g and 59.4 g (1.975-2.095 ounces). [ History of Rule 3 - The Ball http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/history/index.asp#2006 ITF 1 May 2012 ] [ Miscellaneous ] Advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. Vibration dampers may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players&apos; grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear. [ Manner of play ] The dimensions of a tennis court Two players before a serve For individual terms see: Glossary of tennis [ Court ] [ Tennis court ] Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface, usually grass, clay, a hardcourt of concrete and/or asphalt and occasionally carpet (indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and 27  feet (8.23  m) wide for singles matches and 36  ft (10.97  m) for doubles matches. [ http://www.sportsknowhow.com/tennis/dimensions/tennis-court-dimensions.html Sportsknowhow.com Tennis court dimensions 29 May 2007 ] Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is 3  feet 6  inches (1.07  m) high at the posts and 3  feet (91.4  cm) high in the center. &apos;&apos;&apos; The modern tennis court owes its design to Major Walter Clopton Wingfield who, in 1873, patented a court much the same as the current one for his stické tennis (sphairistike). This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield&apos;s version, but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle. [ http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/courts/history.asp Tennis court history – Grass ITF 28 Jul 2008 ] [ Lines ] The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player&apos;s side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve. [ http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf ITF Rules of Tennis – Rule 1 (The Court) ITF 2 May 2012 ] The line dividing the service line in two is called the center line or center service line. The boxes this center line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player&apos;s position, he or she will have to hit the ball into one of these when serving. [ http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf ITF Rules of Tennis – Rule 17 (Serving) ITF 3 May 2012 ] A ball is out only if none of it has hit the line or the area inside the lines upon its first bounce. All the lines are required to be between 1 and [ 2 in mm ] in width. The baseline can be up to [ 4 in mm ] wide. [ Play of a single point ] [ Point (tennis) ] The players (or teams) start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the server, and the opposing player is the receiver. The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game between the two players (or teams.) For each point, the server starts behind their baseline, between the center mark and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net. When the receiver is ready, the server will serve, although the receiver must play to the pace of the server. In a legal service, the ball travels over the net (without touching it) and into the diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a let or net service, which is void, and the server gets to retake that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net. There is also a &quot; foot fault &quot;, which occurs when a player&apos;s foot touches the baseline or an extension of the center mark before the ball is hit. If the second service is also a fault, the server double faults, and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service. A legal service starts a rally, in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of the player or team hitting the ball before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net, provided that it still falls in the server&apos;s court. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel past the net into the other players&apos; court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is still considered a legal return. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point. [ Tennis Terminology cbs.com 31 Dec 2011 http://www.cbssports.com/tennis/story/6145343 ] [ Scoring ] [ Tennis score ] Match The outcome of a tennis match is determined through a best of three or five sets system. Recreational players may agree to play any number of sets, depending upon time availability or stamina. On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. For men, the first player to win three sets wins the match, and for women, the first player to win two sets wins the match. { From 1984 through 1998, women played first-to-win-three-sets in the final of the year-ending } { WTA Tour Championships. } A set consists of games, and games, in turn, consist of points. Game A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as &quot; love &quot;, &quot; fifteen &quot;, &quot; thirty &quot;, and &quot; forty &quot; respectively. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player&apos;s scores equal at forty apiece, the score is not called out as &quot; forty-forty &quot;, but rather as &quot; deuce &quot;. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is &quot; advantage &quot; for the player in the lead. During informal games, &quot; advantage &quot; can also be called &quot; ad in &quot; when the serving player is ahead, or &quot; ad out &quot; when the receiving player is ahead. { Roddick and } { Saulnier. } The score of a tennis match during play is always read with the serving player&apos;s score first. In tournament play, the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g., &quot; fifteen-love &quot; ) after each point. At the end of a game, the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score. Game point [ game point set point match point championship point ] A game point occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play. Break point A break point occurs if the receiver, not the server, has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with the server being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have converted their break point. If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a failure to convert. Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as breaking serve, as the receiver has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point, it is often referred to as breaking back. Set A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6. Only in the final sets of matches at the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, the Olympic Games, Davis Cup, and Fed Cup are tie-breaks not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead. A &quot; love &quot; set means that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a &apos;bagel&apos;. [ ATP Most Bagels Served http://www.tennis.com/stats/men_6-0.aspx Tennis.com 6 May 2012 ] In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase &quot; Game, set, match &quot; followed by the winning person&apos;s or team&apos;s name. The final score in sets is always read with the winning player&apos;s score first, even if the winning player loses set(s) during the match. As an example of a score report, consider a womens&apos; tennis match between Ana Ivanovic and Maria Sharapova. Ana Ivanovic wins the first set 6 –4, but loses the second set 5 –7 and wins the third set 6 –0. Such a result would be written as: [ SRB ] [ RUS ] Ana Ivanovic defeated Maria Sharapova, 6 –4, 5 –7, 6 –0.

Scoring method created by Jimmy Van Alen. The first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by World Team Tennis professional competition and ITF Junior Doubles. Pro set Instead of playing multiple sets, players may play one &quot; pro set &quot;. A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. A 12-point tie-break is usually played when the score is 8–8 (or 10–10). These are often played with no-ad scoring. Match tie-break This is sometimes played instead of a third set. This is played like a regular tie-break, but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. Match tie-breaks are used in the Hopman Cup for mixed doubles, on the ATP and WTA tours for doubles and as a player&apos;s choice in USTA league play. Another, however informal, tennis format is called Canadian doubles. This involves three players, with one person playing a doubles team. The single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. Conversely, the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot. The scoring is the same as a regular game. This format is not sanctioned by any official body. &quot; Australian doubles &quot;, another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the Canadian doubles style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve. Wheelchair tennis can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility. An extra bounce is permitted. This rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and able-bodied matches. It is possible for a doubles team to consist of a wheelchair player and an able-bodied player (referred to as &quot; one-up, one-down &quot; ), or for a wheelchair player to play against an able-bodied player. In such cases, the extra bounce is permitted for the wheelchair users only. [ Surface ] [ Tennis court#Types of tennis courts ] There are five types of court surface used in professional play. Each surface is different in the speed and height of the bounce of the ball. The same surface plays faster indoors than outdoors. Clay Examples are red clay, used at the French Open, and green clay (an example of which is Har-Tru and used mainly in the U.S.). Almost all red clay courts are made not of natural clay but of crushed brick that is packed to make the court. The crushed brick is then covered with a topping of other crushed particles. This type of surface does not absorb water easily and is the most common in Europe and Latin America. Clay courts normally have a slower paced ball and a fairly true bounce with more spin. Hard Examples of hardcourts are acrylic (e.g. Plexicushion used at the Australian Open, DecoTurf used at the US Open ), asphalt, and concrete. Hardcourts typically have a faster-paced ball with a very true bounce and it is the predominant surface type used on the professional tour. Grass [ At Wimbledon, It&apos;s the Grass Stupid http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1815724%2C00.html Time.com 4 May 2012 18 Jun 2008 ] [ Wimbledon Special: Why Rye? The Grass Courts of Wimbledon http://www.gemtennis.com/2010/06/19/wimbledon-special-why-rye-the-grass-courts-of-wimbledon/ GEM Tennis 4 May 2012 ] Grass court s usually have a faster-paced ball, and a more erratic bounce. Grass is used at Wimbledon and until 1974 three of the four Grand Slams (Australian Open, Wimbledon, US Open) were played on grass. In 2001 Wimbledon changed the type of grass to make the courts more durable and thus better able to withstand the wear of the modern game. The new grass causes the ball to bounce higher and slows it down compared to the previous grass type. Carpet Any form of removable court covering, including carpeting and artificial turf. The bounce can be higher or lower than a hard court. Carpet surface has not been used on the ATP and WTA tour since 2009. Wood Popular from the 1880s through the first half of the 20th century, wooden surface provides a very low bounce and plays very fast. There are no longer any professional tournaments held on a wooden surface although some tournaments (e.g. Rotterdam Open and Open Sud de France ), are played on a wood-based court with an acrylic layer on top. [ Officials ] An umpire informing two players of the rules [ Official (tennis) ] In most professional play and some amateur competition, there is an officiating head judge or chair umpire (usually referred to as the umpire), who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court. The umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. The umpire may be assisted by line judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. The umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made. [ http://www.itftennis.com/media/107013/107013.pdf ITF Rules of Tennis – Appendix V (Role of Court Officials) ITF 5 May 2012 ] In some tournaments, line judges who would be calling the serve, were assisted by electronic sensors that beeped to indicate the serve was out. This system was called &quot; Cyclops &quot;. [ Cyclops and speed guns http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/tennis/features/newsid_3001000/3001768.stm BBC 6 May 2012 ] Cyclops has since largely been replaced by the Hawk-Eye system. [ Cyclops knocked off centre as Wimbledon adopts Hawkeye http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/apr/24/tennis The Guardian 6 May 2012 ] [ Hawk-eye Vision http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/27/tennis-hawk-eye?INTCMP%3DILCNETTXT3487 The Guardian 6 May 2012 ] In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tie-break to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review. The US Open, Miami Masters, US Open Series, and World Team Tennis started using this challenge system in 2006 and the Australian Open and Wimbledon introduced the system in 2007. In clay-court matches, such as at the French Open, a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball&apos;s impact on the court surface. The referee, who is usually located off the court, is the final authority about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire&apos;s decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire&apos;s decision on a question of fact. If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire&apos;s decision (This would only happen in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair). Ball boys and girls may be employed to retrieve balls, pass them to the players, and hand players their towels. They have no adjudicative role. In rare events (e.g., if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance), the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened. The umpire may consider their statements when making a decision. In some leagues, especially junior leagues, players make their own calls, trusting each other to be honest. This is the case for many school and university level matches. The referee or referee&apos;s assistant, however, can be called on court at a player&apos;s request, and the referee or assistant may change a player&apos;s call. In unofficiated matches, a ball is out only if the player entitled to make the call is sure that the ball is out. [ Junior tennis ] [ Junior tennis ] In tennis, a junior is a player 18 and under who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian. Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian. These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) or Women&apos;s Tennis Association (WTA) ranking. Most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through ITF, Satellite, Future, and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit. The latter three circuits also have adults competing in them. Some juniors, however, such as Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Frenchman Gaël Monfils, have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments. In 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally. [ ITF Announce Combined Junior Rankings http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_1693_original.PDF ITF 6 May 2012 ] Junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the Grand Slam tournaments, which are the most prestigious junior events. Juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the Future, Satellite, or Challenger tours. Tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points, culminating with Grade A. Leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the Junior Fed Cup and Davis Cup competitions. To succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age. To facilitate and nurture a junior&apos;s growth in tennis, almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system. Juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces, accommodating all different standards of play. Talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions. [ Match play ] Convention dictates that two players shake hands at the end of a match A tennis match is intended to be continuous. [ http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_30333_original.PDF The ITF states this in Rule No. 29 PDF ] Because stamina is a relevant factor, arbitrary delays are not permitted. In most cases, service is required to occur no more than 20 seconds after the end of the previous point. This is increased to 90 seconds when the players change ends (after every odd-numbered game), and a 2 minute break is permitted between sets. Other than this, breaks are permitted only when forced by events beyond the players&apos; control, such as rain, damaged footwear, damaged racquet, or the need to retrieve an errant ball. Should a player be determined to be stalling repeatedly, the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of &quot; point &quot;, &quot; game &quot;, and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit. [ http://www.itftennis.com/media/109832/109832.pdf ITF Code of Conduct for 2012 ITF Pro Circuits Tournaments The first violation of this Section shall be penalised by a Time Violation warning and each subsequent violation shall be penalised by the assessment of one Time Violation point penalty. 7 May 2012 ] In the event of a rain delay, darkness or other external conditions halting play, the match is resumed at a later time, with the same score as at the time of the delay, and the players at the same end of the court when rain halted play, or at the same position (north or south) if play is resumed on a different court. Balls wear out quickly in serious play and, therefore, in ATP and WTA tournaments, they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games, because the first set of balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up. As a courtesy to the receiver, the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used as a reminder that they are using new balls. However, in ITF tournaments like Fed Cup, the balls are changed in a 9–11 style. Continuity of the balls&apos; condition is considered part of the game, so if a re-warm-up is required after an extended break in play (usually due to rain), then the re-warm-up is done using a separate set of balls, and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes. A recent rule change is to allow coaching on court on a limited basis during a match.

[ Grip ] [ Grip (Tennis) ] A grip is a way of holding the racquet in order to hit shots during a match. The grip affects the angle of the racquet face when it hits the ball and influences the pace, spin, and placement of the shot. Players use various grips during play, including the Continental (The &quot; Handshake Grip &quot; ), Eastern (Can be either semi-eastern or full eastern. Usually used for backhands.), and Western (semi-western or full western, usually for forehand grips) grips. Most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting; for example, slice shots and serves call for a Continental grip. [ Grip Guide - A Grip on Your Game http://www.tennis.com/articles/templates/instruction.aspx?articleid%3D1337 Tennis.com 3 May 2012 ] [ Serve ] [ Serve (tennis) ] A serve (or, more formally, a &quot; service &quot; ) in tennis is a shot to start a point. The serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. [ Chang refused to lose 20 years ago http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french09/columns/story?columnist%3Dgarber_greg%26amp%3Bid%3D4173388 ESPN.com 6 May 2012 ] If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a &quot; let &quot; and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get one more try to get the serve in the box. Experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement. The server may employ different types of serve including flat serve, topspin serve, slice serve, and kick (American twist) serve. A reverse type of spin serve is hit in a manner that spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server, the spin direction depending upon right- or left-handedness. If the ball is spinning counterclockwise, it will curve right from the hitter&apos;s point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise. [ Serves http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/skills/4229090.stm BBC 6 May 2012 ] Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; however, advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an &quot; ace &quot;. [ Forehand ] [ Forehand ] For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. There are various grips for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the continental, the eastern, the semi-western, and the western. For a number of years, the small, frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a western grip. Few top players used the western grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s, the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. Players such as Monica Seles or France&apos;s Fabrice Santoro and Marion Bartoli are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands. [ The Two-handed Forehand Revisited http://www.tennisone.com/magazine/iwells/07/smith/2-fh/2fh.php TennisONE 6 May 2012 ] [ Backhand ] [ Backhand ] For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body. It can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. For most of the 20th century, the backhand was performed with one hand, using either an eastern or a continental grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich, but they were lonely exceptions. The two-handed grip gained popularity in the 1970s as Björn Borg, Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, and later Mats Wilander and Marat Safin used it to great effect, and it is now used by a large number of the world&apos;s best players, including Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams. [ Two-Handed is Superior to One-Handed Backhand http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_27759_original.PDF ITF 6 May 2012 Damir Popadic PDF ] Two hands give the player more control, while one hand can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. Reach is also limited with the two-handed shot. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles, use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides. [ Other shots ] A volley is a shot returned to the opponent in mid-air before the ball bounces, generally performed near the net, and is usually made with a stiff-wristed punching motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent&apos;s court. The half volley is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, once again generally in the vicinity of the net. The swinging volley is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net. It is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent, as it returns the ball into the opponent&apos;s court much faster than a standard volley. From a poor defensive position on the baseline, the lob can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent&apos;s court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent&apos;s head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, an opponent near the net may then hit an overhead smash, a hard, serve-like shot, to try to end the point. Finally, if an opponent is deep in his court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot, by softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it. Advanced players will often apply back spin to a drop shot, causing the ball to &quot; skid &quot; upon landing and bounce sideways, with less forward momentum toward their opponent, or even backwards towards the net, thus making it even more difficult to return. [ Tournaments ] [ List of tennis tournaments ] Tournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. Common tournament configurations include men&apos;s singles, women&apos;s singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net. Tournaments may be arranged for specific age groups, with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. Example of this include the Orange Bowl and Les Petits As junior tournaments. There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis. [ http://www.lta.org.uk/PlayAndCompete/DisabilityTennis/DisabilityTennisHearing.htm http://web.archive.org/web/20080205021146/http%3A//www.lta.org.uk/PlayAndCompete/DisabilityTennis/DisabilityTennisHearing.htm 5 Feb 2008 Lawn Tennis Association Deaf tennis 16 Mar 2008 ] In the four Grand Slam tournaments, the singles draws are limited to 128 players for each gender. Most large tournaments Seed players, but players may also be matched by their skill level. According to how well a person does in sanctioned play, a player is given a rating that is adjusted periodically to maintain competitive matches. For example, the United States Tennis Association administers the National Tennis Rating Program ( NTRP ), which rates players between 1.0 and 7.0 in 1/2 point increments. Average club players under this system would rate 3.0–4.5 while world class players would be 7.0 on this scale. [ Grand Slam tournaments ] The four Grand Slam tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world. They are held annually and include, in chronological order, the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Apart from the Olympic Games, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, and Hopman Cup, they are the only tournaments regulated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). [ http://www.itftennis.com/about/grand-slams/overview.aspx ITF Grand Slams Overview 2 May 2012 ] The ITF&apos;s national associations, Tennis Australia (Australian Open), the French Tennis Federation (French Open), the United States Tennis Association (US Open), and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and Lawn Tennis Association (Wimbledon), are delegated the responsibility to organize these events. Aside from the historical significance of these events, they also carry larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments, the Masters 1000 (men) and Premier events (women).

There are 128, more than any other professional tennis tournament. This draw is composed of 32 seeded players, other players ranked in the world&apos;s top 100, qualifiers, and players who receive invitations through wild cards. Grand Slam men&apos;s tournaments have best-of-five set matches while the women play best-of-three. Grand Slam tournaments are among the small number of events that last two weeks, the others being the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Masters. Currently, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have mixed doubles contests. Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and junior tennis competitions. These tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies. For example, players at Wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white. Andre Agassi chose to skip Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 citing the event&apos;s traditionalism, particularly its &quot; predominantly white &quot; dress code.

By a large margin, an Associated Press poll in 1950 named Bill Tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century. [ http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016509.html Tilden brought theatrics to tennis ] From 1920–1930, Tilden won singles titles at Wimbledon three times and the U.S. Championships seven times. In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge &quot; the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived. &quot; [ http://www.authentichistory.com/1930s/sports/1937_Don_Budge_on_Davis_Cup_SF_Win_Over_Von_Cramm.html Don Budge&apos;s Comments After 1937 Davis Cup Semi-final Match Against Baron Gottfried von Cramm (1:07) 29 May 2007 http://web.archive.org/web/20070426051252/http%3A//www.authentichistory.com/1930s/sports/1937_Don_Budge_on_Davis_Cup_SF_Win_Over_Von_Cramm.html April 26, 2007 ] And in his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever. { The Game, My 40 Years in Tennis (1979), Jack Kramer with Frank Deford (ISBN 0-399-12336-9) } Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Tony Trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the open era, Kramer was the best male champion.

Budge reportedly believed that Gonzales was the greatest player ever. { Will Grimsley, Tennis: Its History, People, and Events (1971) } Gonzales said about Hoad, &quot; When Lew&apos;s game was at its peak nobody could touch him.  ... I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique. &quot; During the open era, first Rod Laver and then more recently Björn Borg and Pete Sampras were regarded by many of their contemporaries as among the greatest ever. Andre Agassi, the first of two male players in history to have achieved a Career Golden Slam in singles tennis (followed by Rafael Nadal ), has been called the best service returner in the history of the game. { &quot; Reed&apos;s shotmakers: Men&apos;s return of serve &quot;. } { Yahoo!
