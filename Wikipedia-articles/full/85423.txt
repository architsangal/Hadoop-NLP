[ yes ] [ the capital of Peru ] [ Limeño/a no ] { ) } { PET } { −5 } { 12 } { 2 } { 36 } { S } { 77 } { 1 } { 42 } { W } { 8 } Lima is the capital and the largest city of Peru. It is located in the valleys of the Chillón, Rímac and Lurín rivers, in the central part of the country, on a desert coast overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Together with the seaport of Callao, it forms a contiguous urban area known as the Lima Metropolitan Area. With a population approaching 9 million, Lima is the fifth largest city in Latin America, behind Mexico City, São Paulo, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. Lima is home to one of the largest financial hubs in Latin America. It has been defined as a beta world city by GaWC international ranking. Lima was founded by Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535, as la Ciudad de los Reyes, or &quot; the City of Kings &quot;. It became the capital and most important city in the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru. Following the Peruvian War of Independence, it became the capital of the Republic of Peru. Today, around one-third of the Peruvian population lives in the metropolitan area. Lima is home to one of the oldest higher learning institutions in the New World. The National University of San Marcos, founded on May 12, 1551 during Spanish colonial regime, is the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas. [ Etymology ] According to early Spanish chronicles the Lima area was once called Itchyma, after its original inhabitants. However, even before the Inca occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the Rímac valley had come to be known by visitors as Limaq (Limaq, pronounced [ ˈli.mɑq ], which means &quot; talker &quot; in coastal Quechua ). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted in the local language, thus the chronicles show &quot; Límac &quot; replacing &quot; Ychma &quot; as the common name for the area. [ http://aymara.org/biblio/lima_etimologia.pdf Limaq 2009-10-10 ] Modern scholars speculate that the word &quot; Lima &quot; originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name Limaq. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken Spanish consistently rejects stop consonant s in word-final position. The city was founded in 1535 under the name City of the Kings ( [ Ciudad de los Reyes ] ) because its foundation was decided on January 6, date of the feast of the Epiphany. Nevertheless, this name quickly fell into disuse and Lima became the city&apos;s name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both Lima and Ciudad de los Reyes can be seen together as names for the city. The river that feeds Lima is called Rímac, and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is &quot; Talking River &quot; (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua where the word for &quot; talker &quot; was pronounced [ ˈrimɑq ] ). [ December 2008 ] However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not the Incas, and this name is actually an innovation arising from an effort by the Cuzco nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of Cuzco Quechua. Later, as the original inhabitants of the valley died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. In modern times, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true. [ History ] [ History of Lima ] { Pachacamac was an important religious centre before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors } In the pre-Columbian era, the location of what is now the city of Lima was inhabited by several Amerindian groups under the Ychsma polity, which was incorporated into the Inca Empire in the 15th century. { Conlee et al., &quot; Late Prehispanic sociopolitical complexity &quot;, p. 218. } In 1532, a group of Spanish conquistador s led by Francisco Pizarro defeated the Inca ruler Atahualpa and took over his Empire. As the Spanish Crown had named Pizarro governor of the lands he conquered, { Hemming, The conquest, p. 28. } he chose the Rímac valley to found his capital on January 18, 1535 as Ciudad de los Reyes (City of the Kings). { Klarén, Peru, p. 39. } In August 1536, rebel Inca troops led by Manco Inca besieged the city but were defeated by the Spaniards and their native allies. { Hemming, The conquest, p. 203–206. } Lima gained prestige after being designated capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. { Klarén, Peru, p. 87. } During the next century it flourished as the centre of an extensive trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty with the rest of the Americas, Europe and the Far East. { Andrien, Crisis and decline, pp. 11–13. } However, the city was not free from dangers; the presence of pirates and privateers in the Pacific Ocean lead to the building of the Lima City Walls between 1684 and 1687. { Higgings, Lima, p. 45. } Also in this last year a powerful earthquake destroyed most of the city buildings; { Andrien, Crisis and decline, p. 26. } the earthquake marked a turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with a recession in trade and growing economic competition with other cities such as Buenos Aires. { Andrien, Crisis and decline, p. 28. } { Balconies were a major feature of Lima&apos;s architecture during the colonial period. } In 1746, a powerful earthquake severely damaged Lima and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco. { Walker, &quot; The upper classes &quot;, pp. 53–55. } In the later half of the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas on public health and social control shaped the development of the city. { Ramón, &quot; The script &quot;, pp. 173–174. } During this period, Lima was adversely affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and its control over the important mining region of Upper Peru. { Anna, Fall of the royal government, pp. 4–5. } The city&apos;s economic decline made its elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. { Anna, Fall of the royal government, pp. 23–24. } A combined expedition of Argentine and Chilean patriots under General José de San Martín landed south of Lima in 1820 but did not attack the city. Faced with a naval blockade and the action of guerrillas on land, Viceroy José de la Serna evacuated its capital on July 1821 to save the Royalist army. { Anna, Fall of the royal government, pp. 176–177. } Fearing a popular uprising and lacking any means to impose order, the city council invited San Martín to enter Lima and signed a Declaration of Independence at his request. { Anna, Fall of the royal government, pp. 178–180. } However, the war was not over; in the next two years the city changed hands several times. { Lima City Walls were built between 1684 and 1687 by viceroy } { Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull. } After independence, Lima became the capital of the Republic of Peru but economic stagnation and political turmoil brought urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid development of the city. { Klarén, Peru, p. 169. } The export-led expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest. { Klarén, Peru, p. 170. } During the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific, Chilean troops occupied Lima, looting public museums, libraries and educational institutions. { Higgings, Lima, p. 107. } At the same time, angry mobs attacked wealthy citizens and the Asian population; sacking their properties and businesses. { Klarén, Peru, p. 192. } After the war, the city underwent a process of renewal and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s. During this period, the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues that crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns. { Ramón, &quot; The script &quot;, pp. 180–182. } In 1940, an earthquake destroyed most of the city, which at that time was mostly built of adobe and quincha. In the 1940s, Lima started a period of rapid growth spurred by migration from the Andean regions of Peru, as rural people sought opportunities for work and education. The population, estimated at 0.6 million in 1940, reached 1.9 million by 1960 and 4.8 million by 1980. { Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática, &apos;&apos;Lima Metropolitana perfil socio-demográfico&apos;&apos;. Retrieved on August 12, 2007 } At the start of this period, the urban area was confined to a triangular area bounded by the city&apos;s historic centre, Callao and Chorrillos; in the following decades settlements spread to the north, beyond the Rímac River, to the east, along the Central Highway, and to the south. { Dietz, Poverty and problem-solving, p. 35. } The new migrants, at first confined to slum s in downtown Lima, led this expansion through large-scale land invasions, which evolved into shanty towns, known as pueblos jóvenes. { Dietz, Poverty and problem-solving, p. 36. } [ Geography ] { SPOT satellite } The urban area of Lima covers about [ 800 km2 sqmi on ]. It is located on mostly flat terrain in the Peruvian coastal plain, within the valleys of the Chillón, Rímac and Lurín rivers. The city slopes gently from the shores of the Pacific Ocean into valleys and mountain slopes located as high as [ 500 m ft us ] above mean sea level. Within the city there are isolated hills which are not connected to the surrounding hill chains, such as El Agustino, San Cosme, El Pino, La Milla, Muleria and Pro hills. The San Cristobal hill in the Rimac district, which lies directly north of the downtown area, is the local extreme of an Andean hill outgrowth. Metropolitan Lima has an area of [ 2672.28 km2 sqmi on ], of which [ 825.88 km2 sqmi on ] (31%) comprise the actual city and [ 1846.40 km2 sqmi on ] (69%) the city outskirts. [ November 2008 ] The urban area extends around [ 60 km mi on ] from north to south and around [ 30 km mi on ] from west to east. The city center is located [ 15 km mi on ] inland at the shore of the Rimac river, a vital resource for the city, since it carries what will become drinking water for its inhabitants and fuels the hydroelectric dams that provide electricity to the area. While no official administrative definition for the city exists, it is usually considered to be composed of the central 30 out of the 43 districts of Lima Province, corresponding to an urban area centered around the historic Cercado de Lima district. [ November 2008 ] The city is the core of the Lima Metropolitan Area, one of the ten largest metropolitan areas in the Americas. Lima is the second largest city in the world located in a desert, after Cairo, Egypt. [ Climate ] { Lima International Airport } Lima&apos;s climate is mild and comfortable, despite being located in the tropics and in a desert. Although classified as subtropical, Lima&apos;s proximity to the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean leads to temperatures much cooler than those expected for a subtropical desert, and can be classified as a cool desert climate. It is neither cold nor very hot. Temperatures rarely fall below [ 12 °C °F on ] or rise above [ 29 °C °F on ] throughout the entire year. Two distinct seasons can be identified: summer, from December through April; and winter from June through October. May and November are generally transition months, with the warm-to-cool weather transition being more dramatic. Summers are warm, humid and sunny. Daily temperatures oscillate between lows of [ 18 °C °F on ] to [ 22 °C °F on ], and highs of [ 24 °C °F on ] to [ 29 °C °F on ]. Skies are generally cloud free, especially during daytime. Occasional coastal fogs during some mornings and high clouds during some afternoons and evenings can be present. Lima summer sunsets are well known for being colorful. As such, they have been labeled by the locals as &quot; cielo de brujas &quot; (Spanish for &quot; sky of witches &quot; ), since the sky commonly turns into shades of orange, pink and red around 7 pm. Winter weather is dramatically different. Gray skies, breezy conditions, high humidity and cool temperatures prevail. Long (1-week or more) stretches of dark overcast skies are not uncommon. Persistent morning drizzle occurs occasionally from June through September, coating the streets with a thin layer of water that generally dries up by early afternoon. Winter temperatures in Lima do not vary much between day and night. They range from lows of [ 12 °C °F on ] to [ 16 °C °F on ] and highs of [ 16 °C °F on ] to [ 19 °C °F on ], rarely exceeding [ 20 °C °F on ] except in the easternmost districts. Relative humidity is always very high, particularly in the mornings. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt%3DTT001940 Weather Centre – World Weather – Average Conditions – Lima BBC 2009-07-08 ] High humidity produces brief morning fog during the early summer and a usually persistent low cloud deck during the winter (generally developing in May and persisting all the way into late November or even early December). Predominant onshore flow makes the Lima area one of the cloudiest among the entire Peruvian coast. Lima has only 1284 hours of sunshine a year, 28.6 hours in July and 179.1 hours in January, exceptionally low values for the latitude. [ Capel Molina José J. Lima, un clima de desierto litoral Anales de Geografía de la Universidad Complutense 19 25–45 Universidad Complutense de Madrid Madrid 1999 http://revistas.ucm.es/ghi/02119803/articulos/AGUC9999110025A.PDF 0211-9803 2009-10-10 ] Winter cloudiness prompts locals to seek for sunshine in Andean valleys located at elevations generally above 500 meters above sea level. Although relative humidity levels are high, rainfall is very low due to strong atmospheric stability. The severely low rainfall impacts on water supply in the city, which originates from wells and from rivers that flow from the Andes. [ Painter James http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6412351.stm Americas &amp; #124; Peru&apos;s alarming water truth BBC News 2007-03-12 2009-07-08 ] Inland districts receive anywhere between 1 to [ 6 cm in on ] of rainfall per year, which accumulates mainly during the winter months. Coastal districts receive only 1 to [ 3 cm in on ]. As previously mentioned, winter precipitation occurs in the form of persistent morning drizzle events. These are locally called &apos;garúa&apos;, &apos;llovizna&apos; or &apos; camanchacas &apos;. Summer rain, on the other hand, is infrequent, and occurs in the form of isolated light and brief showers. These generally occur during afternoons and evenings when leftovers from Andean storms arrive from the east. The lack of heavy rainfall arises from high atmospheric stability caused, in term, by the combination of cool waters from semi-permanent coastal upwelling and the presence of the cold Humboldt Current; and warm air aloft associated with the South Pacific anticyclone. The climate of Lima (as that of most of the Peruvian coast) gets severely disrupted during El Niño events. Water temperatures along the coast, which usually average around [ 17 – 19 C F ], get much warmer (as in 1998 when the water temperature reached [ 26 °C °F on ] ). Air temperatures rise accordingly. Such was the case when Lima hit its all-time record high of [ 34 °C °F on ]. Cooler climate develops during La Niña years. The all-time record low in the metropolitan area is [ 8 °C °F on ], measured during the winter of 1988.

In 1562, another district was built at the other side of the Rimac River and in 1610, the first stone bridge was built. Lima then had a population of around 26,000; blacks made up around 40% of the population, and whites made up around 38% of the population. { History of Lima.

From Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa, A Voyage to South America (1748). } In 1861, the number of inhabitants surpassed 100,000, and by 1927, this amount was doubled. [ November 2008 ] During the early twentieth century, thousands of immigrants came to the city, including people of German, French, Italian, and British descent. They organized social clubs, and built their own schools. Examples are The American-Peruvian school, the Alianza Francesa de Lima, the Lycée Franco-Péruvien and the hospital Maison de Sante; Markham College, the British-Peruvian school in Monterrico, Antonio Raymondi Italian School, the Pestalozzi Swiss School and also several German-Peruvian schools. The immigrants influenced Peruvian cuisine, with Italians in particular exerting a strong influence in the Miraflores and San Isidro areas with their restaurants, called trattorias. [ November 2008 ] A great number of Chinese immigrants, and a lesser amount of Japanese, came to Lima and established themselves in the Barrios Altos neighborhood near downtown Lima. Lima residents refer to their Chinatown as Calle Capon, and the city&apos;s ubiquitous Chifa restaurants small, sit-down, usually Chinese-run restaurants serving the Peruvian spin on Chinese cuisine can be found by the dozen in this Chinese enclave.

The financial district is located in the district of San Isidro, while much of the industrial activity takes place in the area stretching west of downtown Lima to the airport in Callao. Lima has the largest export industry in South America, and is a regional hub for the cargo industry. Industrialization began to take hold in Lima in 1930s and by 1950s, through import substitution policies, by 1950 manufacturing made up 14% of the GNP.
