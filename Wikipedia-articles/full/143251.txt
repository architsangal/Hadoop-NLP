G. Wells. It features Academy Award nominated actor Richard Burton, Justin Hayward (of The Moody Blues ), Chris Thompson (of Manfred Mann ), Phil Lynott (of Thin Lizzy ), Julie Covington (of Evita ), and David Essex (Evita). Wayne conducts what would come to be known as the Black Smoke Band and the ULLAdubULLA string orchestra. &quot; Forever Autumn &quot;, &quot; The Eve of the War &quot;, &quot; Thunder Child &quot;, and &quot; The Spirit of Man &quot; are the most recognised individual songs on the album. &quot; Forever Autumn &quot; was a UK Top 5 single, sung by Justin Hayward. The album itself spent 290 weeks in the UK album charts. It was in the top 10 in 22 countries and reached #1 in 11 countries. Most of the lyrics on the album were written by former Elton John lyricist Gary Osborne. The album was one of the first recorded on 48 tracks, using two synchronised 24 track Studer A80s at Advision Studios in London. It was engineered by Geoff Young, who was instrumental in bringing the recordings together with only a 16 track desk. His skill in this regard was later recognised by George Michael, who worked with him to record &quot; Last Christmas &quot; and &quot; Careless Whisper &quot; using the same studio and equipment. The repetition of &quot; Ulla! &quot;, the cry made by the Martians, and certain musical refrains throughout the musical act as leitmotif s. The official album comes with several paintings by Peter Goodfellow, Geoff Taylor and Michael Trim that help to illustrate the story from beginning to end. [ Other versions of the album ] To promote the 1978 release, an abridged album containing &quot; Radio edits &quot; was distributed to radio stations. Special intros and endings had to be added to certain tracks because they simply weren&apos;t written with radio in mind. The &quot; air play &quot; album turned out so well that in 1981 CBS decided to release it commercially under the unwieldy title Highlights from Jeff Wayne&apos;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds. Two Spanish versions of the album were released in 1978, one featuring Anthony Quinn in the role of the journalist, and the other for Spain featuring Teófilo Martinez in the same role. A German version was released in 1980 with Curd Jürgens taking the part of the journalist. A 1989 version of &quot; The Eve of the War &quot; remixed by Ben Liebrand reached number 3 in the UK singles chart. A 1995 special edition of the album featured additional remixes of some tracks and additional conceptual art. Australia n progressive metal band Alchemist released a version of &quot; Eve of the War &quot; on a 1998 EP. In 2000, a collection of remix es of tracks from the original album—including several used in the 1998 computer game—were released on a double CD titled The War of the Worlds: ULLAdubULLA The Remix Album. While most of the contributors are relatively unknown, the album includes two versions of a remix of &quot; Dead London &quot; by Apollo Four Forty. On 23 June 2005 the original album was re-released in two forms: one in a remastered 2-disc Hybrid Multichannel Super Audio CD set; another in a 7-disc &quot; Collector&apos;s Edition &quot; featuring many bonuses such as various remixes, outtakes, and the actors reading from the unabridged script as well as the seventh disc being a DVD showing the making of the album, produced by Phoenix Film &amp; Television Productions. While the original ULLAdubULLA album had a very limited run and has since gone out of print, following the huge success of the 2005 re-release of the original album, ULLAdubULLA II was released on 17 April 2006. This single CD release was largely made of tracks from the original remix album, with some additional new remixes by Tom Middleton and DJ Keltech, and hip-hop versions of two tracks by DJ Zube. Middleton&apos;s remixes of &quot; The Eve of the War &quot; were also released on CD and vinyl. [ Beyond the album ] [ Video games ] In 1984 CRL Group PLC released Jeff Wayne&apos;s Video Game Version of The War of the Worlds for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer. It was also released in Germany as Jeff Wayne&apos;s Video Version von Der Krieg der Welten. In 1998, a real-time strategy game, Jeff Wayne&apos;s The War of the Worlds, was created by Rage Software and released for the personal computer. Jeff Wayne himself produced the musical arrangements for the game, consisting of 45 minutes of material re-scored and remix ed in a newer electronica style with techno beats. The game&apos;s artwork was based on the Michael Trim, Geoff Taylor and Peter Goodfellow illustrations found throughout the original album booklet, and some of Richard Burton &apos;s dialogue as the journalist is used in the opening and closing scenes. In 1999, a third-person shooter, also entitled Jeff Wayne&apos;s The War of the Worlds, was developed by Pixelogic and released for the Sony PlayStation. It used much of the 1998 game&apos;s music and graphical elements, but featured an entirely different campaign with a focus on vehicular combat. In 2011 zGames released &apos;&apos;Jeff Wayne&apos;s Musical Version of The War of The Worlds: Minigame Adventure&apos;&apos;. The Minigame Adventure contains 12 unique minigames for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. [ Animated version ] In late 2004 the ULLAdubULLA II production had been commissioned for an animated CGI film version set for a 2007 release. The film has yet to be released and is still in its production stages. Test footage of some of the Martian machines has been released to War of the Worlds online. { War of the Worlds Online } [ Tour ] A live tour, based on the album, began in the UK and Ireland in April 2006. Jeff Wayne returned to conduct the 48-piece ULLAdubULLA Strings and 10-piece Black Smoke Band. A &quot; virtual &quot; Richard Burton (a projected image of a young Burton with a super-imposed actor&apos;s mouth and jaw lip synch ed to the original Burton recordings) performed as The Journalist. Justin Hayward reprised his original role as The Sung Thoughts of The Journalist and Chris Thompson returned as The Voice Of Humanity. Also from the original recording were Chris Spedding playing lead guitar and Herbie Flowers on bass guitar. Other guest artists who appeared were the &quot; People&apos;s Tenor &quot; Russell Watson as Parson Nathaniel, Alexis James as The Artilleryman, and Tara Blaise as Beth. Daniel Boys (known from BBC&apos;s Any Dream Will Do ) was understudy for all the roles sung by male artists. A model Fighting Machine featured on stage. Also presented was a short animated &apos;prequel&apos; to the story in the style of the upcoming feature-length film detailing the Martians&apos; ecological destruction of their own world (which was originally made for the 1998 computer game &apos;&apos;Jeff Wayne&apos;s The War of the Worlds&apos;&apos; ) and their preparations to invade Earth, and including a short remix of &quot; The Red Weed &quot;. The show was produced by Ray Jones Damian Collier and Jeff Wayne. The live show toured Australia and New Zealand in 2007, with dates in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Auckland. The Australian tour featured Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll as Parson Nathaniel, actress Rachael Beck as Beth and Michael Falzon as the Artilleryman, alongside Justin Hayward and Chris Thompson from the original cast with Chris Spedding and Herbie Flowers in the band. { Showbiz.com.au } A further UK live tour took place in December 2007 with Justin Hayward, Chris Thompson, Alexis James, John Payne as Parson, and Sinéad Quinn as Beth. 2008 marked the 30th anniversary of the original album release and a number of events took place, including a &quot; 30th Anniversary &quot; tour which started on 7 June 2009 in Dublin. [ http://www.thewaroftheworlds.com/news/default.aspx 30th Anniversary of Jeff Wayne&apos;s Musical Version of The War of The Worlds Official Website 2008-06-09 ] The 30th anniversary saw Justin Hayward, Alexis James and Chris Thompson reprise their respective roles, with Shannon Noll taking the role of Parson Nathaniel and Jennifer Ellison as Beth. When Noll had to leave the show halfway through its 2009 tour, the role of Parson Nathaniel went to Damien Edwards, who completed the run. The virtual Richard Burton was also improved; the whole face was animated (an actor was found with a similar facial structure, all of Burton&apos;s narrative parts were mimed, and his face was super-imposed onto the face of the actor). In November 2009 Wayne announced on his website dates for another tour in the UK, Ireland, Germany, and Holland, and for the first time, Belgium, in late 2010–early 2011. Justin Hayward and Chris Thompson reprised their roles as The Sung Thoughts of the Journalist and The Voice of Humanity respectively, with Rhydian Roberts as Parson Nathaniel, Jason Donovan as The Artilleryman and Liz McClarnon as Beth. [ DVD ] A two disc Region 2 DVD of the 2006 Wembley Arena, London show was released 6 November 2006 by Universal. Disc 1 contains the live show and Disc 2 contains extras and a documentary of the making of the live show. It is titled Jeff Wayne&apos;s Musical Version of The War of The Worlds - Live on Stage. [ The New Generation ] In 2011 after a short hiatus from touring, Jeff Wayne announced a new Musical Version of The War of the Worlds album to be released in June 2012 entitled The New Generation. [ http://www.thewaroftheworlds.com/news/newsstory.aspx?id%3D161 The War of The Worlds...The New Generation Official Website 2011-11-18 ] With the album release, The New Generation will also cross Europe on a major arena tour. Wayne explained that the idea was to return to the original album and explore H. G. Wells&apos; characters in more detail, as well as develop the love story between the story&apos;s main character, George Herbert, and his fiancee Carrie. Wayne also explained that it would allow him to re-interpret his compositions with the new production techniques of today. Along with the new album will come a new voice of the Journalist, originally played by Richard Burton in the 1978 album. The role will now be played by Irish actor Liam Neeson, appearing in 3D holography. On 1st March 2012, Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson was announced as the Artilleryman while Kerry Ellis will play Beth. Both Wayne and Neeson were interviewed at the album&apos;s press conference where a clip of Neeson playing the journalist was shown. It was explained that Neeson will appear on stage as Journalist George Herbert in three ways: First as an 11-foot holographic head and shoulders (much like the Richard Burton image on the 2009 tour). Second, as a full body hologram, interacting with live performers on stage without actually being present during the show. And third: Neeson will appear in the 2-hour CGI film displayed on a 100-foot &quot; animation wall &quot; played throughout the show. Jeff Wayne will again conduct the ULLAdubULLA Strings and Black Smoke Band as he has done in the tours before. [ Track listing ] All dialogue written by Doreen and Jerry Wayne, based upon H.G.
