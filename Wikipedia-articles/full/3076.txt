(It is sometimes listed as 15th brightest, if the two brighter components of the Capella quadruple star system are counted as one star.) Along with Aldebaran, Spica, and Regulus it is one of the four brightest stars near the ecliptic. Antares is a slow variable star with an average magnitude of +1.09. [ Properties ] { supergiant Antares and the Sun, shown as the tiny dot toward the upper right. The black circle is the size of the orbit of Mars. } { Arcturus is also included in the picture for size comparison. } Antares is a supergiant star with a stellar classification of M1.5Iab-b. It has a radius of approximately 883 times that of the Sun; if it were placed in the center of our solar system, its outer surface would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Based upon parallax measurements, Antares is approximately [ 550 ly pc off on ] from the Earth. Its visual luminosity is about 10,000 times that of the Sun, but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, the bolometric luminosity equals roughly 65,000 times that of the Sun. The mass of the star is calculated to be 15 to 18 solar mass es. [ Kaler James Antares http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/antares.html 13 August 2008 ] The size of Antares may be calculated using its parallax and angular diameter. The parallax angle is given in the box to the right, and the angular diameter is known from lunar occultation measurements (41.3 ± 0.1 mas). [ A. Richichi April 1990 A new accurate determination of the angular diameter of Antares Astronomy and Astrophysics 230 2 355–362 1990A &amp; A...230..355R ] This leads to a radius of 822 ± 80 solar radii. [ March 2010 source of +/- 80 is unclear, simple calculation using 1990 measurement of 43.1 mas and 1997 Hipparcos parallax of 5.4 +/- 1.68 mas gives a radius from 653 to 1246 solar radii, and not 822 ] Antares is a type LC slow irregular variable star, whose apparent magnitude slowly varies from +0.88 to +1.16. [ Query= alf Sco http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/cgi-bin/search.cgi?search%3Dalf%2BSco Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg General Catalogue of Variable Stars 2010-01-05 ] Antares is visible in the sky all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at opposition to the Sun. At this time, Antares rises at dusk and sets at dawn. For approximately two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near conjunction with the Sun; [ Output generated for 2008 LASCO Star Maps (identify objects in the field of view for any day of the year) Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) Star Maps created using XEphem http://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/index.php?p%3Dsky%2Fstarmap 2011-12-01 ] { (2009, 2010, 2011) } this period of invisibility is longer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, since the star&apos;s declination is significantly south of the celestial equator. [ Companion star ] Illustration of Antares and its companion star, Antares B Antares has a secondary companion star, Antares B, that changed from an angular separation of 3.3 arcseconds in 1854 to 2.86 arcseconds in 1990. The last is equal to a projected separation of about 529   Astronomical Unit s (AU) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the separation of the pair. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggest that it is about 224  AU behind the primary, giving a combined separation of about 574  AU. The stellar classification of this star is B2.5, with numerous spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares. At magnitude 5.5, it is only 1/370th as bright visually as Antares A, although it shines with 170 times the Sun&apos;s luminosity. It is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to Antares&apos; glare, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over [ 150 mm in on ].

Antares B can be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar occultation s while Antares itself is hidden by the Moon; it was discovered by Johann Tobias Bürg during one such occultation on April 13, 1819. [ Burnham&apos;s Celestial Handbook Burnham Robert, Jr. 1978 Dover Publications New York 1666 ] The orbit is poorly known, with an estimated period of 878 years. [ Position on the ecliptic ] { Antares is one of the 4 first magnitude stars that lies within 5° of the ecliptic and therefore can be } { occulted by the Moon and very rarely by Venus. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17th, 525BC; the next one will take place on November 17th, 2400. Other planets did not occult Antares in the last millennium nor will they do so in the next millennium, as they pass as a result of their actual node position and inclination always northward of Antares. On 31 July 2009, Antares was occulted by the Moon. The event was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East. } [ Occultation of Antares on 31 July 09 http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/bstar/0731antares.htm The International Occultation Timing Association 2 August 2009 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] [ http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/City/Pune/Sky-watchers-report-occultation-of-Antares-by-moon/articleshow/4846671.cms The Times Of India Sky watchers report occultation of Antares by moon 2 August 2009 ] { Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5° north of Antares. } [ Traditional names ] Antares, the proper name of this star, derives from the Ancient Greek [ grc Άντάρης ], meaning &quot; anti- Ares &quot; ( &quot; anti-Mars &quot; ), due to the similarity of its red dish hue to the appearance of the planet Mars. { Gettings, Fred ♦ The Arkana Dictionary of Astrology Penguin Books, 1985, p. 24 ♦ &quot; Antares: Sometimes called Antar, in confusion with a literary hero (see Allen), the modern name is said to be derived from its red colour, in that it was rival even of the planet Mars—the Greek, anti-Ares. &quot; } [ Allen R.

The natives born with their moon in this nakshatra show a combination of power, independence and a sense of danger. In China, it was named 心宿二 ( Mandarin : xīn xiù èr), because it was the second star of the asterism 心宿 ( &quot; Heart &quot; ). Antares is listed in MUL.APIN as GABA GIR.TAB, meaning &quot; the Breast of the Scorpion:Lishi, Nabu &quot;. In Renaissance astrology, Antares is one of the Behenian fixed star s and has the symbol File:Agrippa1531 corScorpii.png. Hermes Trismegistus on the Fifteen Fixed Stars features alternate symbols. The Wotjobaluk Koori people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as Djuit, son of Marpean-kurrk ( Arcturus ); the stars on each side represented his wives.
