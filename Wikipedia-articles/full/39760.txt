Because that substance contained an amine group, he called it vitamine. It was later to be known as vitamin B 1 ( thiamine ). He put forward the hypothesis that other diseases, like rickets, pellagra, sprue and scurvy could also be cured by vitamins. The &quot; e &quot; at the end of vitamine was later removed when it was realized that vitamins need not be nitrogen containing amine s. He later postulated the existence of other essential nutrients, which became known as B 1, B 2, C, and D. In 1936 he determined the molecular structure of thiamin, though he was not the first to isolate it. He was the first to isolate nicotinic acid (also called niacin or vitamin B 3 ). Funk also conducted research into hormone s, diabetes, ulcer s, and the biochemistry of cancer. The Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (PIASA) annually honors Polish-American scientists with the Casimir Funk Natural Sciences Award. Past winners include Nobel Laureate Roald Hoffmann, Aleksander Wolszczan, Hilary Koprowski, Peter T. Wolczanski, Wacław Szybalski and Benoît Mandelbrot. Funk returned to the USA In 1940 he became the president of the Funk Foundation for Medical Research and ended his career in pursuit of orally active spleenic extracts.
