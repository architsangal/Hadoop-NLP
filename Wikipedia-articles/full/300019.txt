[ Biography ] Marcel Aymé was born in Joigny, in the Yonne département ( Bourgogne ). He studied in the Collège de Dole, and worked among other as a journalist in Paris. In literature, his first novel was Brûlebois (1926) and in 1929 La Table aux crevés won the Prix Renaudot. After the success of his novel La Jument verte (1933), he concentrated mostly on literature. He published children&apos;s stories, novels and collections. In 1935 he also started writing movie scripts.

[ Work ] One of Aymé&apos;s most famous short stories is Le Passe-Muraille or The Walker-Through-Walls, for which there is a sculpture in Paris that features the story&apos;s main character, Dutilleul. At the age of 42, Dutilleul suddenly discovered he &quot; had the remarkable gift of being able to pass through walls with perfect ease. &quot; What begins as a novelty that gives him pleasure, ends up pushing Dutilleul toward more sinister pursuits.
