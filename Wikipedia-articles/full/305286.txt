{ soybean seeds, a popular legume } A legume [ ˈ l ɛ ɡ (j) uː m ] in botanical writing is a plant in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), or a fruit of these specific plants. A legume fruit is a simple dry fruit that develops from a simple carpel and usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides. A common name for this type of fruit is a pod, although the term &quot; pod &quot; is also applied to a few other fruit types, such as vanilla and radish. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, pea s, bean s, lentil s, lupin s, mesquite, carob, soy, and peanut s. Locust trees ( Gleditsia or Robinia ), wisteria, and the Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus) are also legumes. { Cirrus Digital: Tree Encyclopedia } They are referred in India as Kathod or pulses { Kathod / Pulses: } [ History ] [ section November 2011 ] { &apos;&apos;Vigna unguiculata&apos;&apos; subsp. &apos;&apos;sesquipedalis&apos;&apos; ), } { San Ildefonso, Bulacan. } { Pea pods } The term legume is derived from the Latin word legumen (with the same meaning as the English term), which is believed to come from the verb legere, meaning &quot; to gather. &quot; English borrowed the term from the French légume, which in modern language refers to any kind of vegetable. (The English word legume for the plant family translates into French as légumineuse.) The history of legumes is tied in closely with that of human civilization, appearing early in Asia, the Americas (the common &apos;&apos;Phaseolus&apos;&apos; bean in several varieties), and Europe (broad beans), where they became a staple, essential for supplementing protein where meat was less available. [ Fixation of nitrogen in the soil ] [ section November 2011 ] Legume plants are notable for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, thanks to a symbiotic relationship with bacteria ( rhizobia ) found in root nodules of these plants. The ability to form this mutualism reduces fertilizer costs for farmers and gardeners who grow legumes, and allows legumes to be used in a crop rotation to replenish soil that has been depleted of nitrogen. The nitrogen fixation ability of legumes is enhanced by the availability of calcium in the soil and reduced by the presence of ample nitrogen. Legume seed and foliage have a comparatively higher protein content than non-legume material, probably due to the additional nitrogen that legumes receive through nitrogen-fixation symbiosis. The high protein content makes them desirable crops in agriculture. [ Uses by humans ] { peanut s (&apos;&apos;Arachis hypogaea&apos;&apos;), } { indehiscent legume fruits } { clover, a forage crop } Farmed legumes can belong to many agricultural classes, including forage, grain, blooms, pharmaceutical/industrial, fallow/green manure, and timber species. Most commercially farmed species fill two or more roles simultaneously, depending upon their degree of maturity when harvested. Forage legumes are of two broad types. Some, like alfalfa, clover, vetch ( Vicia ), stylo (Stylosanthes), or Arachis, are sown in pasture and grazed by livestock. Other forage legumes such as Leucaena or Albizia are woody shrub or tree species that are either broken down by livestock or regularly cut by humans to provide livestock feed. Grain legumes are cultivated for their seed s, and are also called pulses. The seeds are used for human and animal consumption or for the production of oils for industrial uses. Grain legumes include bean s, lentil s, lupin s, pea s, and peanut s. { The gene bank and breeding of grain legumes (lupine, vetch, soya, and beah), B.S. Kurlovich and S.I. Repyev (eds.), St. Petersburg:N.I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry, 1995, 438p. - (Theoretical basis of plant breeding. V.111) } Legume species grown for their flowers include lupins, which are farmed commercially for their blooms as well as being popular in gardens worldwide. [ November 2011 ] Industrially farmed legumes include Indigofera and Acacia species, which are cultivated for dye and natural gum production, respectively. [ November 2011 ] Fallow/ green manure legume species are cultivated to be tilled back into the soil in order to exploit the high levels of captured atmospheric nitrogen found in the roots of most legumes. Numerous legumes farmed for this purpose include Leucaena, Cyamopsis, and Sesbania species. Various legume species are farmed for timber production worldwide, including numerous Acacia species and Castanospermum australe. [ November 2011 ] [ Nutritional facts ] Legumes contain relatively low quantities of the essential amino acid methionine - however, this should not be a problem if an adequate amount of protein is consumed. According to the protein combining theory, legumes should be combined with another protein source such as a grain in the same meal, to balance out the amino acid levels. Protein combining has lost favor as theory (with even its original proponent, Frances Moore Lappé, rejecting the need for protein combining in 1981 { Diet for a Small Planet (ISBN 0-345-32120-0), 1981, p. 162; emphasis in original } ) - a variety of protein sources is considered healthy, but these do not have to be consumed at the same meal. In any case, vegetarian cultures often serve legumes along with grain s, which are low in the essential amino acid lysine, creating a more complete protein than either the beans or the grains on their own. Common examples of such combinations are dal with rice by Indians, and beans with corn tortillas, tofu with rice, and peanut butter with wheat bread. { Vogel, Steven.
