[ Corporate history ] [ Early years ] After initially creating the Jagex name and logo for their projects Andrew Gower and Paul Gower began trading under the Jagex name in 1999, [ http://domains.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/874805.htm Decision 2011-05-16 2007 ] describing Jagex Software as a &quot; small software company based in England who specialise in producing top-quality Java-games for webpages. &quot; [ http://classic-web.archive.org/web/19991129010103/http%3A//www.jagex.com/ Jagex Software 2011-05-16 1999 ] That same year they began work on the MMORPG RuneScape, which was released in January 2001. In December 2001, Andrew Gower, Paul Gower, and Constant Tedder launched Jagex in its current incarnation, with Tedder as its CEO. [ http://www.runescape.com/kbase/guid/jagex About Jagex 2011-05-16 2011 ] Jagex Ltd formally acquired the Jagex name from Andrew Gower in 2001. An early Jagex logo RuneScape grew dramatically; one year after its release over a million free accounts had been registered. The game was originally supported by advertisements, however, the Dot-com bubble meant that there were fewer advertisers willing or able to sign with Jagex. One of the first tasks of the new company was to create a paid version of the game with extra features, to support hosting costs and continued development. This was achieved on 27 February 2002 when the pay-to-play version of RuneScape was released. It gained 5,000 subscribers in the first week, making it one of the largest Java pay-to-play games in the world at the time. [ Employees ] As RuneScape gained users, Jagex grew its employee base. By 11 December 2003, RuneScape had 65,000 paying members, and Jagex had 29 employees.

[ Investors and management ] On 23 October 2007, Geoff Iddison, former European CEO of PayPal, replaced Constant Tedder as CEO in order to &quot; accelerate international growth. &quot; Iddison resigned as CEO in January 2009, and was replaced by Mark Gerhard, who had been Jagex CTO before his appointment. Though Andrew Gower is currently listed as Jagex&apos;s principal architect, [ http://www.jagex.com/kbase/guid/full_credits_list Jagex Credits List 2011-05-16 2011 ] it is unclear how involved he, his brother, and Tedder still are in the management of Jagex. Jagex received an investment from Insight Venture Partners in October 2005, before which the company had been self-funded.
