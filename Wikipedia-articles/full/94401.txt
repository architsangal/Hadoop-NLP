[ the prison Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison) ] [ 51 31 17 N 00 14 20 W type:landmark_scale:3000 title ] Looking east from the south-western edge of the Scrubs Wormwood Scrubs, known locally as The Scrubs, is an open space located in the north-eastern corner of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in west London. It is the largest open space in the Borough, at 80 ha (200 acres), and one of the largest areas of common land in London. The eastern part, known as Little Wormwood Scrubs, is cut off by Scrubs Lane and the West London Line railway. It has been an open public space since the Wormwood Scrubs Act of 21 July 1879, and is recognised by Natural England as an important site of natural significance. The southern edge of the Scrubs is the site of two locally important buildings. At the western end is HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, built between 1875 and 1891 by convict labour. To the east of the prison is the Hammersmith Hospital campus, which includes the relocated Queen Charlotte&apos;s and Chelsea Hospital. Within the area are several sports facilities, including the Linford Christie stadium, tens of football pitches and a pony centre. Queens Park Rangers Football Club played on The Scrubs between 1888 and 1889. Wormwood Scrubs is also an area of restricted airspace up to [ 2000 ft m ]. [ September 2011 ] [ History ] In the early 19th century the whole district was open fields, and included several areas of common land. In 1812 an area of [ 190 acre km2 ] known as Wormholt Scrubs was leased by the War Office from the Manor of Fulham. This was in order to exercise cavalry horses which until that point had been hacked out in Hyde Park, Belgrave Square and Regent&apos;s Park - then known as St. Marylebone&apos;s Park. This common land became known as Wormwood Scrubs, [ 135 acre km2 ] of which was bought by the War Office in 1878. In 1879, Parliament passed The Wormwood Scrubs Act, which aimed to create a &quot; metropolitan exercising ground &quot; for the military and to provide the Scrubs for &quot; the perpetual use by the inhabitants of the metropolis for exercise and recreation &quot;. Under this act, the military were able to expel civilians from the Scrubs whenever they were training, but allowed civilians free use of the area when they were not. To ensure that the Scrubs were kept as open land for all to enjoy, the act banned the military from building any permanent structures other than rifle butts, one of which survives today as a wall in the Linford Christie Stadium. The Scrubs became recognised as the duelling ground of London, with several duel s having been fought there.

In 1910 Wormwood Scrubs became part of aviation history when a pioneer airship took flight from an improvised landing ground; The Daily Mail Airship Garage was built shortly afterwards—the site is now occupied by the Linford Christie Stadium. In 1914 all air related activities on the Scrubs passed to the authority of the Admiralty, and there are records of a base here called &apos;Wormwood Scrubs Naval Air Station&apos; in the National Archives at Kew. The airship shed was used to train RNAS armoured car crews. { The Devil&apos;s Chariots, John Glanfield, Sutton Publishing Ltd 2001, ISBN 0-7509-4152-9 (p.58) } It remained as an emergency landing ground until the 1930s. In 1939 with the onset of another World War, Wormwood Scrubs again played host to an innovative military department—The Chief Cable Censorship Department, an outstation of the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS) at Bletchley Park. Until 1940 it was served by St. Quintin Park and Wormwood Scrubs, a station on the West London Line. It was closed after heavy bombing damage during the Second World War. The prison is located just yards from the scene of the Massacre of Braybrook Street in 1966, in which three policemen were shot dead by three armed men after stopping their suspicious car.

Holloway and his campaign petitioned the House of Lords, [ http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1987/jul/06/channel-tunnel-bill-1 Channel Tunnel Bill (Hansard, 6 July 1987) Hansard.millbanksystems.com 2010-11-02 ] supported by the then MP for Fulham Nick Raynsford, and won concessions. The existing nature reserve includes an area known as &apos;Lester&apos;s Embankment&apos;. [ http://www.scrubs-online.org.uk/Documents/Bird%20Reports/2008/BirdsOctober2008.pdf October 2008 Sightings at Wormwood Scrubs PDF 2010-11-02 ] The campaign attracted considerable national publicity in 1987, and even a musical. [ http://ashleyhutchings2.tripod.com/thewildsideoftown.html The Wild Side Of Town Ashleyhutchings2.tripod.com 2010-11-02 ] On 10 March 2009 the prison was listed as a Grade II building. { &apos;Ere Fletch they&apos;ve only gone and listed the Scrubs, by Mira Bar-hillel, Daily Mail. } The Scrubs, one of the largest open spaces close to central London, is always under threat of development. The local politics of the Scrubs are a constant battle between vigilant groups like The Friends of Wormwood Scrubs { The Friends of Wormwood Scrubs } and various interests—the railway, the local council and others—who always have an eye to building on the green space. [ Finances ] The Wormwood Scrubs Charitable Trust, the charity set up under the Act of Parliament to manage this public space &quot; for the exercise and recreation of the inhabitants of the metropolis &quot;, earns a very healthy income stream from the lease of a car park to Hammersmith Hospital on its Southern boundary. Other sources of income from the space include the rental of sports fields, advertising billboards, and two public car parks. The accounting for costs and revenues of the Charity have been a matter of debate between the Council, currently sole Trustee of the Trust, and the Friends of Wormwood Scrubs. { &quot; Cabinet meeting papers that approved the 3x increase in costs &quot; } [ Local Nature Reserve ] Wormwood Scrubs is a Local Nature Reserve. Habitats include woodland (plantation), scrub and grassland. Animals include common lizards, over 100 species of bird and 20 species of butterfly. This site is currently being managed by the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in collaboration with Groundwork UK. { Wormwood Scrubs, Natural England } [ Current conservation efforts ] Conservation work that is currently being carried out in Wormwood Scrubs by Groundwork London has been the subject of much controversy among users of the Scrubs. The primary goal is to connect each patch of the Local Nature Reserve within the grounds by a wildlife corridor in the form of low hedges and trees. Ultimately, it is claimed that this will benefit the overall biodiversity in the park as well as create better foraging routes for bats such as the Common pipistrelle. Habitats for the local population of common lizard s are also being improved by various means, such as by the removal of scrub to create basking areas. Parts of this work involves planting a large number of trees, and it is feared that this could jeopardise the uniquely open nature of the common. The bulk of the work is currently being undertaken by volunteers for Groundwork London, a government quasi non-governmental organisation funded largely through a levy on landfill.
