Agitated by a patron repeatedly sending his fried potatoes back because they were too thick, soggy and bland, resort hotel chef, George Crum, decided to slice the potatoes as thin as possible, frying them until crisp and seasoning them with extra salt. Contrary to Crum&apos;s expectation, the patron (sometimes identified as Cornelius Vanderbilt ) loved the new chips [ http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Potato-Chip.html How potato chip is made - used, processing, product, machine, Raw Materials, The Manufacturing Process, Quality Control, Byproducts/Waste, The Future Madehow.com 1915-01-06 2010-08-03 ] and they soon became a regular item on the lodge&apos;s menu under the name &quot; Saratoga Chips &quot;. { Civil War Recipes and Food History - The Potato During the Civil War } Alternative explanations of the provenance of potato chips date them to recipes in Shilling Cookery for the People by Alexis Soyer (1845) or Mary Randolph &apos;s The Virginia House-Wife (1824). { The Story Behind the Dish: Classic American Foods By Mark McWilliams;2012; page 186 } In the 20th century, potato chips spread beyond chef-cooked restaurant fare and began to be mass produced for home consumption.

The early potato chip bag was wax paper with the ends ironed or stapled together. At first, potato chips were packaged in barrels or tins, which left chips at the bottom stale and crumbled. Laura Scudder, an entrepreneur in Monterey Park, California started having her workers take home sheets of wax paper to iron into the form of bags, which were filled with chips at her factory the next day. This pioneering method reduced crumbling and kept the chips fresh and crisp longer. This innovation, along with the invention of cellophane, allowed potato chips to become a mass market product. Today, chips are packaged in plastic bags, with nitrogen gas blown in prior to sealing to lengthen shelf life, and provide protection against crushing.

The innovation became an overnight sensation in the food industry with the heads of some of the biggest potato chip companies in the United States traveling to the small Tayto company in Ireland to examine the product and to negotiate the rights to use the new technology. Companies worldwide sought to buy the rights to Tayto&apos;s technique. The sale of the Tayto company made the owner and the small family group, who had changed the face of potato chip manufacturing, very wealthy. An advertisement for Smith&apos;s Potato Crisps The Tayto&apos;s innovation changed the entire nature of the potato chip, and led to the end of Smith&apos;s twist of salt. ( Walkers revived the idea of &quot; salt in a bag &quot;, following their takeover of Smith&apos;s (UK) in 1979, with their Salt &apos;n&apos; Shake potato crisps. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A471377 BBC h2g2 - Smiths Salt &apos;n&apos; Shake Crisps BBC 2009-05-26 ] ) Later chip manufacturers added natural and artificial seasonings to potato chips with varying degrees of success. A product that had had a large appeal to a limited market on the basis of one seasoning now had a degree of market penetration through vast numbers of seasonings. Various other seasonings of chips are sold in different locales, including the original Cheese and Onion, produced by Tayto, which remains by far Ireland&apos;s biggest manufacturer of crisps. [ Nomenclature ] { India n potato chips } There is little consistency in the English speaking world for names of fried potato cuttings. American and Canadian English use &quot; chips &quot; for the above mentioned dish—this term is also used (but not universally) in other parts of the world, due to the influence of American culture—and sometimes &quot; crisps &quot; for the same made from batter. In the United Kingdom and Ireland crisps are potato chips while chips refer to thick strips similar to french fries (as in &quot; fish and chips &quot; ) and served hot. In Australia, some parts of South Africa, the south of New Zealand, India, the general West Indies especially in Barbados, both forms of potato product are simply known as &quot; chips &quot;, as are the larger &quot; home-style &quot; potato crisps. In the north of New Zealand they are known as &quot; chippies &quot; but are marketed as &quot; chips &quot; throughout the country. Sometimes the distinction is made between &quot; hot chips &quot; (fried potatoes) and &quot; potato chips &quot; in Australia and New Zealand. In Bangladesh, they are generally known as chip or chips, and much less as crisps (pronounced &quot; kirisp &quot; ) and locally Álu Bhaja. [ Health concerns ] Potato chips were originally fried and seasoned without concern for trans fat s, sodium, sugar, or other nutrient levels. As nutritional intake guidelines were created in various countries and the nutrition facts label became commonplace, consumers, advocacy groups, and health organizations have focused on the nutritional value of junk food s, including potato chips.

New England Magazine 2011-06-23 2011-07-15 ] [ sentence May 2012 ] Some potato chip companies have responded to the criticism, both informal and legal, by investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create health-conscious products. Kettle Foods was founded in 1978 and currently sells only trans fat-free products, including potato chips. PepsiCo research shows that approximately 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. Frito-Lay spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of Lay&apos;s potato chips without adversely affecting flavor. The starch in potato chips causes tooth erosion. [ http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Dental-decay/Pages/Prevention.aspx NHS tooth decay prevention 2012-03-31 ] [ March 2012 ] A big concern about the health content of crisps is that, owing to the fact that they are often made with salt, they may contain substantial levels of sodium. However, it has been claimed that crisps may actually contain less sodium/salt than the equivalent weight in corn flakes. The excessive consumption of crisps will cause you to become obese which produces a rise in blood pressure. It has been pointed out that crisp contain less salt than Golden Graham cereals (SOURCE: http://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/news/surveys/2004/cereals/index.html). It should also be noted that crisps may contain significant levels of potassium.

In Indonesia, barbecue, corn, and roast chicken are the favorites. Another variety of chips are cassava chips. In Ireland, the common varieties of crisps are similar to those sold in the UK. However in Ireland, the word Tayto is synonymous with crisps after the Tayto brand and can be used to describe all varieties of crisp, including those not produced by Tayto. Owing to the dominance of Tayto in the Irish market, the word has become a genericized trademark. Walkers crisps were launched there several years ago, but have failed to dominate the market. Hunky Dorys and King crisps are other popular Irish brands. In Japan, flavors include nori &amp; salt, consommé, wasabi, soy sauce &amp; butter, garlic, ume, barbecue, pizza, mayonnaise, and black pepper.

Stores in regions with a significant Hispanic population sell lime flavored chips using the Mexican name, limón. In the general timeframe of 2010 to 2012, stores in the United States have been featuring potato chips labeled on the package as &quot; Kettle Cooked. &quot; [ Similar foods ] Another type of potato chip, notably the Pringles and Lay&apos;s Stax brands, is made by extruding or pressing a dough made from ground potatoes into the desired shape before frying. This makes chips that are very uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid tubes. In America, the official term for Pringles is &quot; potato crisps &quot;, but they are rarely referred to as such. Conversely Pringles may be termed &quot; potato chips &quot; in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional &quot; crisps &quot;. An additional variant of potato chips exists in the form of &quot; potato sticks &quot;, also called &quot; shoestring potatoes &quot;. These are made as extremely thin (2–3  mm) versions of the popular French fry, but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A hickory -smoke flavor version is popular in Canada, going by the vending machine name &quot; Hickory Sticks &quot;. Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringle&apos;s container). Reckitt Benckiser was a market leader in this category under the Durkee Potato Stix and French&apos;s Potato Sticks names, but exited the business in 2008. A larger variant (approximately 1  cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as Andy Capp&apos;s Pub Fries, using the theme of a long-running British comic strip, which are baked and come in a variety of flavors.Walkers make a similar product called &quot; Chipsticks &quot; which are Salt and Vinegar flavored. The Ready Salted flavor had been discontinued. Some companies have also marketed baked potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well known in the media when an ingredient many contained, Olestra, was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools. [ http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html NIDDK...WIN Notes Win.niddk.nih.gov 1998-02-21 2009-05-26 ] The success of crisp fried potato chips also gave birth to fried corn chip s, with such brands as Fritos, CC&apos;s and Doritos dominating the market. &quot; Swamp chips &quot; are similarly made from a variety of root vegetables, such as parsnip s, rutabaga s and carrot s. Japanese-style variants include extruded chips, like products made from rice or cassava. In South Indian snack cuisine, there is an item called HappLa in Kannada/vadam in Tamil, which is a chip made of an extruded rice/sago or multigrain base that has been around for many centuries. There are many other products which might be called &quot; crisps &quot; in Britain, but would not be classed as &quot; potato chips &quot; because they aren&apos;t made with potato and/or aren&apos;t chipped (for example, Wotsits, Quavers, Skips, Hula Hoops and Monster Munch). Kettle-style chips (known as hand-cooked in the UK/Europe) are traditionally made by the &quot; batch-style &quot; process, where all chips are fried all at once at a low temperature profile, and continuously raked to prevent them from sticking together. There has been some development recently where kettle-style chips are able to be produced by a &quot; continuous-style &quot; process (like a long conveyor belt), creating the same old-fashioned texture and flavor of a real kettle-cooked chip. Non-potato based chips also exist. Kumara (sweet potato) chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand and Japan; parsnip, beetroot and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom. India is famous for a large number of localized &apos;chips shops&apos;, selling not only potato chips but also other varieties such as plantain chips, tapioca chips, yam chips and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as chifles or tostones, are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In Kenya, chips are made even from arrowroot and casava. In the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice have been released and marketed as lower in fat than their potato counterparts. Recently, the Australian company Absolute Organic has also released chips made from beetroot.
