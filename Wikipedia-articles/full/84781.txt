She starred in 37 films in Hollywood and in France, including Breathless (1960), the musical Paint Your Wagon (1969) and the disaster film Airport (1970). Jean Seberg is also one of the most well-known victims of FBI COINTELPRO project. Her victimization was rendered as a well-documented retaliation for her support of civil rights and activist groups in the 1960s. [ Early life ] Jean Seberg was born in Marshalltown, Iowa, the daughter of Dorothy Arline (née Benson), a substitute teacher, and Edward Waldemar Seberg, a druggist.

Her name was entered by a neighbor. { &quot; Seberg: Real-life Cinderella &quot; by Peer J. Oppenheimer, } { The Palm Beach Post, April 28, 1957, p. 11 } By the time she was cast, on October 21, 1956, her only acting experience had been a single season of summer stock performances. { &quot; &apos;Saint Joan&apos; Chosen &quot;, } { The Spokesman-Review, October 22, 1956, p. 1 } The film was paired with a great deal of publicity about which Seberg commented that she was &quot; embarrassed by all the attention &quot;. Despite a big build-up, called in the press a &quot; Pygmalion experiment &quot;, both the film and Seberg received poor notices. { &quot; Second Chance for Jean &quot;, } { The Age, October 8, 1957, p. 13 } On the failure, she later told the press: &quot; I have two memories of Saint Joan. The first was being burned at the stake in the picture. The second was being burned at the stake by the critics. The latter hurt more. I was scared like a rabbit and it showed on the screen. It was not a good experience at all. I started where most actresses end up. &quot; { &quot; Jean Seberg Failed As Saint On Screen, Scores Success In France As A Sinner &quot; by Bob Thomas, } { The Blade, August 6, 1961, p. 2 } Preminger, though, had promised her a second chance, and he cast Seberg in his next film Bonjour Tristesse the following year, which was filmed in France. Regarding his decision, Preminger told the press: &quot; It&apos;s quite true that, if I had chosen Audrey Hepburn instead of Jean Seberg, it would have been less of a risk, but I prefer to take the risk. [..] I have faith in her. Sure, she still has things to learn about acting, but so did Kim Novak when she started. &quot; Seberg again received atrocious reviews and the film nearly ended her career. Her next role was in the 1959 comedy, The Mouse That Roared, starring Peter Sellers. Deciding she had no luck in English-language films, Seberg moved to France, where she scored success as the free-love heroine of French New Wave films. Most notably, she appeared as Patricia in Jean-Luc Godard &apos;s Breathless (original French title: À bout de souffle), in which she co-starred with Jean-Paul Belmondo. The film became an international success and critics praised Seberg&apos;s performance, François Truffaut even hailing her &quot; the best actress in Europe. &quot; { &quot; Jean Seberg: A Hollywood tragedy &quot; by Charles Champlin, } { The Modesto Bee, September 16, 1979, p. F-6 } Despite her achievements in this genre, Seberg did not identify with her characters or the film plots, saying that she was &quot; making films in France about people [she&apos;s] not really interested in. &quot; The critics did not agree with Seberg&apos;s absence of enthusiasm, and raved about her performances, inspiring Hollywood and Broadway to make her important offers. In 1961, Seberg took on the lead role in her then husband François Moreuil&apos;s debut film, La recréation. By that time, Seberg had been estranged from Moreuil, and she recollected that production was &quot; pure hell &quot; and that he &quot; would scream at [her]. &quot; After moving back to the United States, she starred opposite Warren Beatty in Lilith (1964), which prompted the critics to acknowledge Seberg as a serious actress. In 1969, she appeared in her first and only musical film, Paint Your Wagon, based on Lerner and Loewe &apos;s stage musical, and co-starring Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood, but her singing voice was dubbed by Anita Gordon. [ Music of the Postwar Era Tyler Don 2008 Greenwood Press United States of America 978-0-313-34191-5 152 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DslHsWvLKB5sC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA152 June 25, 2010 Marvin and Eastwood sang, but Miss Seberg&apos;s vocals were dubbed by Anita Gordon. ] Seberg also starred in the disaster film Airport (1970) opposite Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin. At the peak of her career, Seberg suddenly stopped acting in Hollywood films. Reportedly, she was not pleased with the roles she had been offered, some of which, she noted, bordered on pornography. [ http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/1181/ The Jean Seberg Enigma: Interview With Garry Mcgee Film Threat July 17, 2011 ] Conversely, she was not offered any great Hollywood roles, regardless of their size. Some have said she was blacklisted due to an infamous FBI smear campaign revolving around issues in her personal life. Others have dismissed that any blacklist occurred. Seberg was willing to work in a Paramount production whose screenplay she had been sent but the film was never made. Seberg was François Truffaut&apos;s first choice for the central role of Julie in Day for Night but, after several fruitless attempts to contact her, Truffaut gave up and cast British actress Jacqueline Bisset instead. [ Garry McGee Jean Seberg – Breathless BearManor Media Albany, GA 2008 1-59393-127-1 238 ] Her last US film appearance was in the TV movie Mousey (1974). Seberg remained busy during the 1970s, but only in European films. Seberg later appeared in Bianchi cavalli d&apos;Agosto (White Horses of Summer) (1975), Le Grand Délire (Die Große Ekstase) (1975, with husband Dennis Berry) and Die Wildente (1976, based on Ibsen&apos;s The Wild Duck { IMDb } ). [ FBI COINTELPRO Investigation ] FBI inter-office memo: &quot;... cause her embarrassment and cheapen her image &quot; &quot; There is no indication that Richard Wallace ever considered [the Seberg scam] to be anything other than an extremely successful COINTELPRO operation &quot; { Churchill, Ward and Vander Wall, Jim, The Cointelpro Papers: Documents from the FBI&apos;s Secret Wars Against Domestic Dissent, South End Press, Boston, MA, 1990. } During the late 1960s, Seberg provided financial support to various group supporting civil rights, such as the NAACP and Native American school groups such as the Mesquaki Bucks at the Tama settlement near her home town of Marshalltown, for whom she purchased $500 worth of basketball uniforms. FBI management was very upset about several gifts to the Black Panther Party [ David Richards Played Out: The Jean Seberg Story Random House 1981 0-394-51132-8 204 ], totalling $10,500 (estimated) in contributions; these were noted among a list of other celebrities in FBI internal documents later released under FOIA. This financial support, and her alleged interracial love affairs or friendships were evident triggers to a large-scale FBI program deployment in her direction.

[ &quot; Jean Seberg... should be neutralized &quot; ] In 1970, the FBI created the false story { Richards 234–8 } from a San Francisco-based informant, that the child she was carrying was not fathered by her husband Romain Gary, but by a member of the Black Panther Party, Raymond Hewitt. { Munn, p. 90 } The story was reported by gossip columnist Joyce Haber of the Los Angeles Times,. { Richards, p.239 } It was also printed by Newsweek magazine. { Richards, p.247 } She gave birth to a girl named Nina on August 23, 1970 in Geneva, but the infant died two days later. { Richards, p.253 } She held an open casket funeral in her hometown to allow the curious to see the infant&apos;s white skin, to disprove the rumors.

[ Surveillance, U.S. and abroad ] It should be noted that &apos;investigation&apos; of Ms. Seberg went far beyond the publishing of defamatory articles. According to her friends, interviewed after her death, Ms. Seberg experienced years of aggressive in-person surveillance (constant stalking), as well as break-ins and other intimidation oriented activity. FBI files show that not only was she wiretapped, but aggressive U.S. official surveillance was deployed while travelling in Switzerland, and Italy, and while she resided in France. i.e. FBI files show that the FBI cross-contacted the &quot; FBI Legat &quot; (legal attachés) in U.S. Embassies in Paris and Rome, to monitor the actress while abroad; the FBI also provided files on Seberg to the CIA, U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Military intelligence to assist in monitoring Ms. Seberg while travelling abroad. Newspaper reports after her death make clear Seberg was aware of the surveillance; in 1980, the Los Angeles Times published FBI logs of her Swiss wiretapped phone calls: &quot; It doesn&apos;t matter you know, I&apos;ve got little friends who follow &quot; [ Hoover, Nixon involved ] FBI records released show that J. Edgar Hoover himself kept U.S. President Richard Nixon informed of FBI activities related to the Jean Seberg case via President Nixon&apos;s domestic affairs chief John Ehrlichman; John Mitchell, then Attorney General, and Deputy Attorney General Richard Kleindienst were also kept informed of FBI activities related to Jean Seberg. { &quot; Extensive probe of Jean Seberg Revealed &quot;, Ronald Ostrow, The Times, January 9, 1980. http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/photos/uncategorized/2009/03/22/1980_0106_jean_seberg_2.jpg } [ Lurid aspects ] FBI files are full of judgmental and derogatory statements about Seberg&apos;s intimate personal life. For example, she was referred to as &quot; the alleged promiscuous and sex-perverted white actress &quot;. It should be noted that not all the information about her case was released to the public; principally, only the files related to the newspaper libel affair were released.

[ Personal life ] Seberg married François Moreuil, a French movie director who directed her in La récréation, in 1958; they divorced in 1960. According to Seberg, the marriage was a &quot; violent &quot; one, and she complained that she &quot; got married for all the wrong reasons. &quot; On living in France for a period of time, Seberg said in an interview: &quot; I&apos;m enjoying it to the fullest extent. I&apos;ve been tremendously lucky to have gone through this experience at an age where I can still learn. That doesn&apos;t mean that I will stay here. I&apos;m in Paris because my work has been here. I&apos;m not an expatriate. I will go where the work is. The French life has its drawbacks. One of them is the formality. The system seems to be based on saving the maximum of yourself for those nearest you. Perhaps that is better than the other extreme in Hollywood, where people give so much of themselves in public life that they have nothing left over for their families. Still, it is hard for an American to get used to. Often I will get excited over a luncheon table only to have the hostess say discreetly that coffee will be served in the other room. [..] I miss that casualness and friendliness of Americans, the kind that makes people smile. I also miss blue jeans, milk shakes, thick steaks and supermarkets. &quot; In 1962, she married French novelist and diplomat Romain Gary, who was 24 years her senior. Their only child together, a son, was named Diego. During her marriage to Gary, Seberg lived in Paris, Greece, Southern France and Majorca. { &quot; What makes Jean Seberg Run? &quot;, } { Tri-City Herald, June 21, 1970, p. 8 } In 1972, she married film director Dennis Berry. In 1979, Jean had &quot; a form of marriage &quot; to Ahmed Hasni while separated from her legally-wed husband. { Richards, p.367 } Hasni persuaded her to sell her second apartment on the Rue du Bac, and he kept the proceeds (reportedly 11 million franc s in cash), announcing that he would use the money to open a Barcelona restaurant. { Richards, p.368 } The couple departed for Spain but she was soon back in Paris alone, and went into hiding from Hasni, who she said had grievously abused her. { Richards, p.369 } [ Death ] Grave of Jean Seberg In August 1979, she went missing and was found dead eleven days later in the back seat of her car, which was parked close to her Paris apartment in the 16th arrondissement. The police report stated that she had taken a massive overdose of barbiturate s and alcohol (8g per liter). A suicide note ( &quot; Forgive me. I can no longer live with my nerves. &quot; ) was found in her hand, and &quot; probable suicide &quot; was ultimately ruled the official cause of death by the French coroner. However, it is often questioned how she could have operated a car with that amount of alcohol in her body, and without the corrective lenses she needed for driving. { Richards, p.377 } One year later, her former husband Romain Gary committed suicide. Seberg was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris, France. { Jean Seberg at Find a Grave access 9/20/2010 } [ Legacy ] In 1995, a documentary of her life was made by Mark Rappaport, titled From the Journals of Jean Seberg. Mary Beth Hurt played Seberg in a voice-over. Appropriately, Hurt was also born in Marshalltown, Iowa, in 1948, attended the same high school as Seberg, and Seberg had been her babysitter. A musical, Jean Seberg, by librettist Julian Barry, composer Marvin Hamlisch, and lyricist Christopher Adler, based on Seberg&apos;s life, was presented in 1983 at the National Theatre in London. Mexican author and diplomat Carlos Fuentes mirrored their short-termed alleged love story in his 1994 novel Diana o La Cazadora Solitaria (Diana, or The Solitary Hunter). The short 2000 film Je t&apos;aime John Wayne is a tribute parody of Breathless, with Camilla Rutherford playing Seberg&apos;s role. In 2004, the French author Alain Absire published Jean S., a fictionalised biography. Seberg&apos;s son, Alexandre Diego Gary, brought a lawsuit unsuccessfully attempting to stop publication. In 1991, Jodie Foster, a fan of her performance in Breathless, purchased the film rights to the David Richards&apos; biography about Seberg, Played Out: The Jean Seberg Story.
