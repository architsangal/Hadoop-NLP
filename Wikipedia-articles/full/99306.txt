[ 1 ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 5.4 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 5.4 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and 0.18% is water. [ History ] College Park was developed beginning in 1889 near the Maryland Agricultural College (later the University of Maryland ) and the College Station stop of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The suburb was incorporated in 1945 and included the subdivisions of College Park, Lakeland, Berwyn, Oak Spring, Branchville, Daniel&apos;s Park, and Hollywood. The original College Park subdivision was first plotted in 1872 by Eugene Campbell. The area remained undeveloped and was re-platted in 1889 by John O. Johnson and Samuel Curriden, Washington real estate developers. The original [ 125 acre km2 on ] tract was divided into a grid-street pattern with long, narrow building lots, with a standard lot size of [ 50 ft m ] by [ 200 ft m ]. College Park developed rapidly, catering to those who were seeking to escape the crowded Washington, D.C., as well as to a rapidly expanding staff of college faculty and employees. College Park originally included single-family residences constructed in the Shingle, Queen Anne, and Stick styles, as well as modest vernacular dwellings. Commercial development increased in the 1920s, aided by the increased automobile traffic and the growing campus along Baltimore Avenue / Route 1. By the late 1930s, most of the original subdivision had been partially developed. Several fraternities and sororities from the University of Maryland built houses in the neighborhood. After World War II, construction consisted mostly of infill of ranch and split-level houses. After incorporation in 1945, the city continued to grow and build amunicipal center in 1959. [ http://www.sha.maryland.gov/oppen/pg_co.pdf Community Summary Sheet, Prince George&apos;s County 2008-05-10 College Park, Maryland Maryland State Highway Administration, 1999 ] The Lakeland neighborhood was developed beginning in 1892 around the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, whose Branchville and Calvert Road depots were located approximately one mile to the north and south, respectively. Lakeland was created by Edwin Newman, who improved the original [ 238 acre km2 ] located to the west of the railroad. He also built a number of the original homes, a small town hall, and a general store. The area was originally envisioned as a resort-type community around Lake Artemesia. However, due to the flood-prone, low-lying topography, the neighborhood attracted a lower-income population became an area for African-American settlement. Around 1900, the Baltimore Gold Fish Company built five artificial lakes in the area to spawn goldfish and rare species of fish. A one-room school was built in 1903 for the African-American population; a new school was built in 1925. The Berwyn neighborhood was developed beginning about 1885 adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It was created by Francis Shannabrook, a Pennsylvanian who purchased a tract of land between Baltimore Avenue and the railroad tracks. Shannabrook established a small depot, built a general store, and erected approximately 15 homes in the area to attract moderate-income families looking to move out of Washington. The neighborhood began to grow after 1900 when the City and Suburban Electric Railway entered the area. By 1925 there were approximately 100 single-family homes; mostly two-story, wood-frame buildings. The community housing continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s with one story bungalows, capes, and victorians, and later grew to include raised ranches and split level homes. The Daniels Park neighborhood was developed beginning in 1905 on the east and west sides of the City and Suburban Electric Railway in north College Park. Daniels Park was created by Edward Daniels on [ 47 acre m2 ] of land. This small residential subdivisionwas improved with single-family houses arranged along a grid pattern of streets. The houses range in style from American Foursquare s to bungalows, and were built between 1905 and the 1930s. The Hollywood neighborhood was developed beginning in the early 20th century along the City and Suburban Electric Railway. Edward Daniels, the developer of Daniels Park, planned the Hollywood subdivision as a northern extension of that earlier community. Development in Hollywood was slow until after World War II when Albert Turner acquired large tracts of the northern part of the neighborhood in the late 1940s. Turner was able to develop and market brick and frame three-bedroom bungalows beginning in 1950. By 1952, an elementary school had been built. The Hollywood Park, a [ 21 acre m2 on ] facility along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, is operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. [ Spring Training ] In 1943, the Washington Senators held Spring Training camp in College Park. In order to conserve rail transport during World War II, the 1943 Spring Training was limited to an area east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River. { Suehsdorf, A. D. (1978).

This storm moved at peak intensity through the University of Maryland, College Park campus, and then moved parallel to I-95 through the Laurel area, where F3 damage was also noted. The damage path from this storm was measured at [ 17.5 mi km ] in length, and this tornado caused two deaths and 55 injuries, along with $101 million in property damage. The two deaths were sisters who died when their car was picked up and hurled over a building before being slammed to the ground; both young women were University of Maryland students. This tornado was part of the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., tornado outbreak of 2001, one of the most dramatic recent tornado events to directly affect the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. The first tornado of the outbreak was also the strongest  – an F4 (see Fujita scale ) tornado that left a [ 10 mi km on ] -long damage path through rural Culpeper and Fauquier Counties in Virginia. Weak (F1) tornadoes east of Warrenton, and just west of Dulles International Airport soon followed. A second supercell to the southeast spawned the family of tornadoes that moved through Washington. A first tornado (F0) was confirmed in the Quantico and Prince William Forest Park areas; this was soon followed by an F1 tornado that left a [ 15 mi km on ] -long path parallel to I-95 and I-395 through Franconia, western Alexandria and Arlington. This tornado dissipated near the west end of the Mall in Washington, D.C., and was followed by many reports of funnel clouds. This same storm produced the F3 tornado that roared through College Park.

By the turn of the 21st century, College Park began experiencing significant development pressure. Both students and city residents have decried the city&apos;s lack of amenities and poor sense of place. In 2002, the city and county passed the Route 1 Sector Plan, which allowed and encouraged mixed use development on College Park&apos;s main roadway. Recent projects like the East Campus Redevelopment Initiative, the University View and Northgate Condos give many in the community hope that the city may one day be like other notable college towns around the country, with a vibrant downtown and a diverse population. A full list of current projects in the pipeline can be found on the City of College Park&apos;s Economic Development Updates. The University of Maryland&apos;s Student Government Association sponsored a design charrette in April 2006 to envision the future of College Park. In July 2006, a group of students created Rethink College Park —a community group providing a website to share information about development and encourage public dialogue. Currently, in the year 2010, there have been notable architectural additions to the city of College Park, Maryland. A parking garage was completed in the downtown area in August 2009 near the intersection of Route 1 and Knox Road.

Occasionally, University of Maryland students plan voter registration drives and seek to elect one of their own to the city council. City residents, including students living within the city are eligible to run for city council if they are over the age of 21. Over the past twenty years there have been multiple attempts, none of which were successful until Marcus Afzali won a seat in 2009. 1993 – Dana L. Loewenstein &amp; Michael J. Moore – Perhaps the most controversial of all student races was that of Loewenstein, a former president of the Panhellenic Association, the sorority umbrella organization at the university. A year after she had lost the election, she was charged with 16 counts of perjury, 16 counts of aiding and advising to falsely register voters and faced a maximum prison sentence of over 200+ years. Ms. Loewenstein&apos;s opponent in the council race, Michael Smith, joined former council member Chester Joy in filing a complaint with the Prince George&apos;s County Board of Elections days before the Nov. 2 election. The complaint alleged that 16 of her sorority pledges lived in one district but registered in another. The complaint was turned over to the state&apos;s attorney, who filed criminal charges against Loewenstein a year after she lost the election. The complaint alleged that all of the pledges lived in on-campus dorms but used the Sigma Delta Tau house address as their residence. At trial, the 16 sorority pledges testified they signed the registration cards during their first meeting, when they were probationary members. Loewenstein was found not guilty by the Circuit Court. 2001 – Mike Mann &amp; Daniel Dorfman – In November 2001, Michael Mann and Daniel Dorfman, sought the two District 3 seats on the College Park City Council. Campaigning against incumbent Eric Olson and for an open seat created by then-councilman Brayman&apos;s decision to run for mayor, the two campaigned heavily to inform students there was a council race going on that year, and registered over 700 students to vote in the municipal election. Despite their hard work and an almost year-long campaign, they were defeated. 2007 – Nick Aragon – In January 2007, Nick Aragon lost a special election for the city council. Two incumbents created a vacancy when they were elected to higher county offices. In turn, the city was forced to hold a special election after the November 2006 elections. The city chose an election date during the university&apos;s winter recess, a time when many students were away from the city. With some help from the Student Government Association (SGA) and an endorsement by College Park Mayor Steve Brayman, the Aragon campaign encouraged students to use absentee ballots, although few actually did, and Aragon lost the election. [ http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2009/elections/md/city-councilor/1374/marcus-d-afzali/ The Washington Post Marcus D. Afzali (I) ] 2009- Marcus Afzali- Marcus Afzali, a 24-year-old doctoral student in the Department of Government and Politics at UMD, won a seat on the city council representing District 4 in November 2009. Afzali attributed displays of &quot; energy &quot; --exemplified by taking time to knock on doors and reach out to residents—as the cause behind his success. The 2009 election is notable not only for Afzali&apos;s performance at the polls, but for the fact that both District 4 incumbents lost. http://www.diamondbackonline.com/news/both-incumbents-tossed-out-in-district-4-1.859870 [ References ] [ Further reading ] A Guide to the City of College Park, from the College Park City Hall.
