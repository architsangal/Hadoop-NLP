[ Ethiopia ] { Region } { Tigray } { Zone } { Mehakelegnaw } { kingdom of Aksum and its neighbors } Axum or Aksum is a city in northern Ethiopia which was the original capital of the eponymous kingdom of Axum. Population 56,500 (2010). Axum was a naval and trading power that ruled the region from ca. 400 BC into the 10th century. The kingdom was also arbitrarily identified as Abyssinia, Ethiopia, and India in medieval writings. [ Overview ] Located in the Mehakelegnaw Zone of the Tigray Region near the base of the Adwa mountains, Axum has an elevation of 2,131 meters. It is the administrative center of La&apos;ilay Maychew woreda. Aksum is served by an airport ( ICAO code HAAX, IATA AXU). Due to their historical value, in 1980 UNESCO added Aksum&apos;s archaeological sites to its list of World Heritage Site s. [ History ] [ Aksumite Empire the early history of Axum ] Axum was the center of the marine trading power known as the Aksumite Kingdom, which predated the earliest mentions in Roman era writings. Around 356, its ruler was converted to Christianity by Frumentius. Later, under the reign of Kaleb, Axum was a quasi-ally of Byzantium against the Persian Empire. The historical record is unclear, primary sources limited mainly to ancient church records. It is believed it began a long slow decline after the 7th century due partly to Islamic groups contesting trade routes. Eventually Aksum was cut off from its principal markets in Alexandria, Byzantium and Southern Europe and its trade share was captured by Arab traders of the era. The Kingdom of Aksum was finally destroyed by Gudit, and eventually the people of Aksum were forced south and their civilization declined. As the kingdom&apos;s power declined so did the influence of the city, which is believed to have lost population in the decline similar to Rome and other cities thrust away from the flow of world events. The last known (nominal) king to reign was crowned ca. 10th century, but the kingdom&apos;s influence and power ended long before that. Its decline in population and trade then contributed to the shift of the power center of the Ethiopian Empire so that it moved further inland and bequeathed its alternative place name (Ethiopia) to the region, and eventually, the modern state. { G. Mokhtar, UNESCO General History of America, Vol. II, Abridged Edition (Berkeley: University of Aksum Press, 1990), pp. 215-35. ISBN 0-85255-092-8 } The King Azana, also helped with the rise of the Islam religion. During the times of the Axum empire, Azana also help his own against war with the Persia and Byzantine empires. [ Aksum kingdom and Ethiopian Church ] { Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion } The Chapel of the Tablet The Kingdom of Aksum had its own written language called Ge&apos;ez, and also developed a distinctive architecture exemplified by giant obelisks, the oldest of which (though much smaller) date from 5000–2000 BC. { Herausgegeben von Uhlig, Siegbert, Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 871. } This kingdom was at its height under King Ezana, baptized as Abreha, in the 4th century (which was also when it officially embraced Christian ity ). { JD Fage, A History of Africa (London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 53–4. ISBN 0-415-25248-2 } The Ethiopian Orthodox Church claims that the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Aksum houses the Biblical Ark of the Covenant in which lie the Tablets of Law upon which the Ten Commandments are inscribed. { Hodd, Mike, Footprint East Africa Handbook (New York: Footprint Travel Guides, 2002), p. 859. ISBN 1-900949-65-2. } This same church was the site where Ethiopian emperors were crowned for centuries until the reign of Fasilides, then again beginning with Yohannes IV until the end of the empire. Axum is considered to be the holiest city in Ethiopia and is an important destination of pilgrimages. { See Linda Kay Davidson and David Gitlitz ‘’Pilgrimage, from the Ganges to Graceland: an Encyclopedia’’ (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2002), 17–18. } Significant religious festivals are the T&apos;imk&apos;et Festival (known as the Epiphany in western Christianity) on 7 January and the Festival of Maryam Zion in late November. In 1937, a 24-metre tall, 1,700-year-old Obelisk of Axum broken into five parts and lying on the ground, was found and shipped by Italian soldiers to Rome to be erected. The obelisk is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of engineering from the height of the Axumite empire. Despite a 1947 United Nations agreement that the obelisk would be shipped back, Italy balked, resulting in a long-standing diplomatic dispute with the Ethiopian government, which views the obelisk as a symbol of national identity. In April 2005, Italy finally returned the obelisk pieces to Axum amidst much official and public rejoicing; Italy also covered the $4 million costs of the transfer. UNESCO has assumed responsibility for the re-installation of this stele in Axum, and as of the end of July 2008 the obelisk has been reinstalled (see panographic photos in external links below). Rededication of the obelisk took place on 4 September 2008 in Paris, France with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi dedicating the obelisk to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano for his kind efforts in returning the obelisk. [ Axum and Islam ] The Axumite Empire has a longstanding relationship with Islam. According to ibn Hisham, { ibn Hisham, The Life of the Prophet } when Prophet Muhammad faced oppression from the Quraish clan, he sent a small group that included his daughter Ruqayya and her husband Uthman ibn Affan to Axum. Ashama ibn Abjar, the King of Axum, gave them refuge and protection and refused the requests of the Quraish clan to send these refugees back to Arabia. These refugees did not return until the sixth year of the Hijra ( 628 ), and even then many remained in Ethiopia, eventually settling at Negash in eastern Tigray. There are different traditions concerning the effect these early Muslims had on the ruler of Axum. The Muslim tradition is that the ruler of Axum was so impressed by these refugees that he became a secret convert. { Ibn Ishaq, The Life of Muhammad (Oxford, 1955), 657–58. } On the other hand, Arabic historians and Ethiopian tradition state that some of the Muslim refugees who lived in Ethiopia during this time converted to Orthodox Christianity. There is also a second Ethiopian tradition that, on the death of Ashama ibn Abjar, Muhammed is reported to have prayed for the king&apos;s soul, and told his followers, &quot; Leave the Abyssinians in peace, as long as they do not take the offensive. &quot; { Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 42f } [ Main sights ] Northern Stelae park, with a neighborhood in the background The major Aksumite monument s in the town are stelae; the largest number lie in the Northern Stelae Park, ranging up to the 33-metre (33 metres high 3.84 metres wide 2.35 metres deep, weighing 520 tonnes) Great Stele, believed to have fallen and broken during construction. The tallest standing is the 24-metre (20.6 metres high 2.65 metres wide 1.18 metres deep, weighing 160 tonnes) King Ezana&apos;s Stele. Another stele (24.6 metres high 2.32 metres wide 1.36 metres deep, weighing 170 tonnes) removed by the Italian army was returned to Ethiopia in 2005 and reinstalled July 31, 2008. { &quot; Mission accomplished: Aksum Obelisk successfully reinstalled &quot; (August 1, 2008) } This stele was already broken into pieces before being shipped. Three more stelae measure 18.2 metres high 1.56 metres wide 0.76 metres deep, weighing 56 tonnes; 15.8 metres high 2.35 metres wide 1 metres deep, weighing 75 tonnes; 15.3 metres high 1.47 metres wide 0.78 metres deep, weighing 43 tonnes. { Scarre, Chris Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World 1999 } The stelae are believed to mark graves and would have had cast metal discs affixed to their sides, which are also carved with architectural designs. The Gudit Stelae to the west of town, unlike the northern area, are interspersed with mostly 4th century tomb s. Other features of the town include St Mary of Zion church, built in 1665 and said to contain the Ark of the Covenant (a prominent twentieth-century church of the same name neighbours it), archaeological and ethnographic museum s, the Ezana Stone written in Sabaean, Ge&apos;ez and Ancient Greek in a similar manner to the Rosetta Stone, King Bazen&apos;s Tomb (a megalith considered to be one of the earliest structures), the so-called Queen of Sheba&apos;s Bath (actually a reservoir ), the fourth-century Ta&apos;akha Maryam and 6th-century Dungur palaces, the monasteries of Abba Pentalewon and Abba Liqanos and the Lioness of Gobedra rock art. Local legend claims the Queen of Sheba lived in the town. [ Demographics ] Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Axum has an estimated total population of 47,320 of whom 20,774 are men and 21,898 women. { CSA 2005 National Statistics, Table B.4 } The 1994 national census reported a total population for this city of 27,148, of whom 12,536 were men and 14,612 were women. The largest ethnic group reported was the Tigrayan (98.54%) and Tigrinya was spoken as a first language by 98.68%. The majority of the population practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity with 85.08% reported as embracing that religion, while 14.81% were Muslim. { &apos;&apos;1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples&apos; Region&apos;&apos;, Vol. 1, part 1, Tables 2.2, 2.13, 2.16, 2.20 (accessed 30 December 2008) } [ Aksum University ] Axum University was established in Axum in May 2006 on a green field site, four kilometers from the town center; the inauguration ceremony was held on 16 February 2007. The current area of the campus is 107 hectares, with ample room for potential expansion. [ November 2010 ] The establishment of a university in Axum is expected to contribute much to the ongoing development of the country in general and of the region in particular. [ See also ] List of megalithic sites The university of Axum is also said to have a lot of books, these books were lost history books during the war against Axum and the byzantine empire.
