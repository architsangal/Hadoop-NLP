( [ 003490 ] ), operating as Korean Air, is both the flag carrier and the largest airline of South Korea, with global headquarters located in Seoul, South Korea. Korean Air&apos;s international passenger division and related subsidiary cargo division together serve 130 cities in 45 countries, while its domestic division serves 20 destinations. It is among the top 20 airlines in the world in terms of passengers carried and is also the top-ranked international cargo airline. Incheon International Airport serves as Korean Air&apos;s international hub. Korean Air also maintains a satellite headquarters campus at Incheon. [ History ] [ November 2008 ] [ Founding ] Korean Air was founded by the South Korean government in 1962 as Korean Air Lines to replace Korean National Airlines, which was founded in 1946 [ December 2011 ]. On 1 March 1969 the Hanjin Transport Group took control of the airline. Long-haul freight operations were introduced on 26 April 1971 followed by passenger services to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on 19 April 1972. International flights to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Los Angeles were flown with Boeing 707 s until the introduction of Boeing 747 in 1973 [ December 2011 ]. In 1973, the airline introduced Boeing 747 s on their Pacific routes and in the same year started a European service to Paris, France using the 707 and the DC-10. In 1975 the airline became one of the first Asian airlines to operate Airbus aircraft with the purchase of three A300s, which were put into immediate service on Asian routes. { &apos;&apos;Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd. History&apos;&apos; } [ Change to &apos;Korean Air&apos; ] A blue-top, silver and redesigned livery with a new corporate &quot; Korean Air &quot; logo featuring an accented, stylized &quot; taegeukgi &quot; design was introduced on 1 March 1984 and the airline&apos;s name changed to Korean Air from Korean Air Lines. This livery was introduced on its Fokker F28 s. [ December 2011 ] It was designed in cooperation between Korean Air and Boeing. In the 1990s, Korean Air became the first airline to use the new MD-11 to supplement its also-new fleet of Boeing 747-400 aircraft; however, the MD-11 did not meet the airline&apos;s performance requirements and they were eventually converted to freighters. Some older 747 aircraft were also converted for freight service. [ December 2011 ] [ Further expansion and founding of Jin Air ] In the 1980s Korean Air&apos;s head office was in the KAL Building on Namdaemunno, Jung-gu, Seoul. { &quot; World Airline Directory. &quot; } { Flight International. May 16, 1981. 1444. } As of 2007, Korean Air was in negotiations to open its China hub in Beijing or Shanghai by the end of 2008. [ December 2011 ] On 5 June 2007, Korean Air said that it would create a new low-cost carrier called Jin Air in Korea to compete with Korea&apos;s KTX super-high speed railway network system, which offers cheaper fares and less stringent security procedures compared to air travel. Korean Air&apos;s low-cost subsidiary is Jin Air, which started its scheduled passenger service from Seoul to Jeju on 17 July 2008. Korean Air announced that some of its B737s and A300s would be given to Jin Air. [ December 2011 ] By 2009 Korean Air&apos;s image had become more prestigious, differing from the airline&apos;s late-1990s image, which had been tarnished by several fatal accidents. { Yu, Roger. &quot; Korean Air upgrades service, image. &quot; } { USA Today.
