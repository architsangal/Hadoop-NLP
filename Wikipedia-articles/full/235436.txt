Many modifications of encircling nets are used, including traps or weir s. The latter are stationary enclosures composed of stakes into which schools of sardines are diverted as they swim along the coast. The fish are caught mainly at night, when they approach the surface to feed on plankton. After harvesting, the fish are submerged in brine while they are transported to shore. Sardines are commercially fished for a variety of uses: for bait; for immediate consumption; for drying, salting, or smoking; and for reduction into fish meal or oil. The chief use of sardines is for human consumption, but fish meal is used as animal feed, while sardine oil has many uses, including the manufacture of paint, varnish and linoleum. { seiner } [ As food ] [ Sardine (food) ] Sardines are a common type of fish consumed by humans, as they are rich in nutrients. They are commonly served in cans, but fresh sardines are often grilled, pickled or smoked. Sardines are rich in vitamins and minerals. A small serving of sardines once a day can provide 13 percent of vitamin B2; roughly one-quarter of niacin and about 150 percent of vitamin B12 of the recommended daily value. All B vitamins help to support proper nervous system function and are used for energy metabolism, or converting food into energy. { http://www.livestrong.com/article/276201-sardine-benefits/ Retrieved 2012-2-22 } Also, sardines are high in the major minerals such as phosphorus, calcium, potassium, and some trace minerals like iron and selenium. Sardines are also a natural source of marine omega-3 fatty acid s, which reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease.

However, as of 2007, stocks are improving. { River Cottage : Gone Fishing 22/11/08 } Since 1997, sardines from Cornwall have been sold as &quot; Cornish sardines &quot;, and since March 2010, under EU law, Cornish sardines have Protected Geographical Status. { EU Directory of PGI/PDO/TSG - Cornish Sardines profile (accessed 1/11/2010) } The industry has featured in numerous works of art, particularly by Stanhope Forbes and other Newlyn School artists.

It has also been used as the name of a children&apos;s game, where one person hides and each successive person who finds the hidden one packs into the same space until there is only one left out, who becomes the next one to hide. { http://itpedia.nyu.edu/wiki/Stinky_Sardine_Club } Sardines are a prominent prop in Michael Frayn &apos;s farce Noises Off.
