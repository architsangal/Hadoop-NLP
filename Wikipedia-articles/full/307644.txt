It is in the Southland region and lies at the western end of Oreti Beach, 30 kilometres west of Invercargill on the Southern Scenic Route. It is approx. 45  km from Stewart Island and provides a safe harbour from the Foveaux Straight. Riverton is one of New Zealand&apos;s oldest towns. 2011 saw their 175th celebrations. The Pourakino River and Aparima River empty into Foveaux Strait at Riverton. Riverton&apos;s population is currently about 1900 people, and its main industry is fishing. However farming (esp. dairying) is fast becoming the industry of influence as the fishing slowly dries up. The fish factory based on its main wharf has now closed. The harbour is still quite busy however as it is the nearest safe harbour for access to NZ&apos;s south / west seas. It is also popular for water skiing, rowing, fishing and catching the occasional flounder. Real estate has been the biggest boom of late which has seen prices rise over 300 - 500 percent. In 2005 there was one main estate agent but [ 2008 on ] the town has up to 6 at any one time. This is mainly due to the recent economic boom in NZ and the fact that Riverton has one of a few safe swimming beaches making it a popular destination within the immediate region surrounding Invercargill. The large camping ground which was only one block off the beach has been bought by land developers and is sliced up into house lots. This leaves one small camping ground up on the hill and very limited other accommodation. It has a high school called Aparima College (years 7-13), and a primary school called Riverton Primary. [ History ] Riverton was established by Captain John Howell as a whaling station about 1837, when it was called Jacob&apos;s River. His house, which survives, was built about that time and is the oldest surviving building in the South Island. His grave site is well kept in the local cemetery. On 9 June 1879, a branch line railway from Invercargill was opened to Riverton. Over the course of the next few decades, further extensions were made to the railway and it became known as the Tuatapere Branch. On 30 July 1976, it was truncated from Tuatapere back to Riverton and became known as the Riverton Branch. There were hopes that forestry traffic would generate sufficient tonnages to warrant the continued operation of the line, but these hopes failed to come to fruition and the railway to Riverton was closed on 15 January 1978. The railway truss bridge and causeway were removed in 2001. [ Surfing ] Riverton has some great surf spots for those who like to &apos;ride the waves&apos;. Mitchells Bay is a great right hand point break that performs well at mid tide, waves can be found at &apos;Petrol Pumps&apos; (named after a now closed small Caltex auto garage located there), the bay before and occasionally further round when the tides are right. Colac Bay, home of NZ&apos;s largest surf statue has a gnarly beach break that will test even the experienced with both left and right-handers. There is also the infamous &apos;Porridge&apos;. A very large left hand point break that breaks more boards that the local board repairers can keep up with. Best you check with the locals for directions. Mitchells Bay is perfect for learning but some days it might be a bit too much for the learners. [ Art ] Riverton has a great art gallery that runs mainly summer hours plus two private galleries.. This town is blessed with a high degree of artists and their work can be found at any of the three local galleries. Local artists include Wayne Hill, a surfing local who creates mainly sculpture from beach scavenged materials. John Husband, features often in the local newspaper and has a nice historical feel to his paintings and drawings and Dawn Barry who paints often with a sea based theme. Dawn has her own gallery &apos;around the rocks&apos;.The local Community Board has commissioned a public work titled Pahi. It is by local artist Kere Menzies and features sculptured sails made from steel. [ Attractions ] The Rocks; includes Mitchells Bay and Hendersons Bay.
