[ History ] On of the earliest mentions of Bosci de Boreham (Wood of Boreham), is in 1188: &quot; In 1188 Pope Clement granted to the kitchen of the monastery the whole land of Elstree. He also gave to the Abbey the wood of Boreham for the feeding of the swine. &quot; William Page (editor), &quot; Elstree &quot;, A History of the County of Hertford: volume 2, 1908 (at British History Online) retrieved 16 Oct 2011. Refers to Matthew Paris &apos;, Chronica Majora, vi, 46. In 1776, the House of Lords granted: &quot; An Act for dividing and closing the Common or Waste Ground, called Boreham Wood Common, in the Parish of Elstree otherwise Idletree, in the Country of Hertford. &quot; &lt; Journals of the House of Lords, Volume 34, Publisher HMSO, 1774 ( page 614 ) Up until 1909, the town was part of the ancient parish of Elstree; the two still share a local council, Elstree and Boreham Wood Town Council. From the 1920s onwards, the town became known as one of the main centres of the UK film, and later television, industries due to the presence of production studios. Following World War II, the town&apos;s population greatly increased, with large areas of council housing set up for displaced Londoners, many of which are now in private ownership. Fast train connections to central London have resulted in the town becoming a primarily residential suburb. Boreham Wood is currently undergoing a substantial housing transformation which has seen hundreds of new homes built over the last five years. There are currently two further developments being built and more are expected. In addition to the studios, the town is also home to many retail shops, offices and light industry.
