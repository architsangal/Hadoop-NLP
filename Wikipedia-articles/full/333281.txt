[ For the book by Goethe, see West-östlicher Diwan. ] Rehearsal under the direction of Daniel Barenboim, in Pilas, Seville, Spain, on July 25, 2005 The West-Eastern Divan is a youth orchestra based in Sevilla, Spain, consisting of musicians from countries in the Middle East, of Egyptian, Iranian, Israeli, Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian and Spanish background. The Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim and the late Palestinian-American academic Edward Said founded the orchestra in 1999, and named the ensemble after an anthology of poems by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The first orchestra workshop was in Weimar, Germany, in 1999, [ http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9D0DE0DB1031F932A15751C1A9609C8B63%26amp%3Bsec%3D%26amp%3Bspon%3D%26amp%3Bpagewanted%3Dall Barenboim Seeks Harmony, And More Than One Type New York Times Anthony Tommasini 21 December 2006 2008-11-01 ] after the organisation had received over 200 applications from Arab music students.

The aim of the West-Eastern Divan is to promote understanding between Israelis and Palestinians and pave the way for a peaceful and fair solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Barenboim himself has spoken of the ensemble as follows: &quot; The Divan is not a love story, and it is not a peace story. It has very flatteringly been described as a project for peace. It isn&apos;t. It&apos;s not going to bring peace, whether you play well or not so well. The Divan was conceived as a project against ignorance. A project against the fact that it is absolutely essential for people to get to know the other, to understand what the other thinks and feels, without necessarily agreeing with it. I&apos;m not trying to convert the Arab members of the Divan to the Israeli point of view, and [I&apos;m] not trying to convince the Israelis to the Arab point of view. But I want to - and unfortunately I am alone in this now that Edward died a few years ago -...create a platform where the two sides can disagree and not resort to knives. &quot; [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jul/13/classicalmusicandopera.culture Bridging the gap, part two The Guardian Ed Vulliamy 13 July 2008 2008-11-01 ] One of the young musicians of the orchestra reinforced this point: &quot; Barenboim is always saying his project is not political. But one of the really great things is that this is a political statement by both sides. It is more important not for people like myself, but for people to see that it is possible to sit down with Arab people and play. The orchestra is a human laboratory that can express to the whole world how to cope with the other. &quot; [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jul/13/classicalmusicandopera.israelandthepalestinians Bridging the gap, part one The Guardian Ed Vulliamy 13 July 2008 2008-11-01 ] The orchestra has performed around the world, including Israel and the Palestinian territories. It has an annual summer school in Seville. Since 2002, the Junta de Andalucía (Regional Government of Andalusia) and a private foundation have provided a base for the ensemble in Seville, Spain. Young musicians from Spain now also take part in the orchestra. The West-Eastern Divan Workshop takes place during several weeks each summer in Andalucia. Once the working period is over, the concert tour of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra starts. The orchestra has been awarded several prizes since its creation, among them the Príncipe de Asturias concord award in 2002 for Said and Barenboim, and the Premium Imperiale awarded by the Japan Arts Association. In 2004, the Barenboim-Said Foundation, based in Seville and financed by the Junta de Andalucía was established with the purpose of developing several education through music projects based on the principles of coexistence and dialogue promoted by Said and Barenboim. In addition to managing the orchestra, the Barenboim-Said Foundation assists with other projects such as the Academy of Orchestral Studies, the Musical Education in Palestine project and the Early Childhood Musical Education Project in Seville. A film by Paul Smaczny about the orchestra, Knowledge is the Beginning, won the Emmy Award for best documentary related to arts of 2006. In 2007, the orchestra received the Praemium Imperiale Grant for Young Artists. It has recorded for the Teldec label.
