The conference participates at the NCAA Division I level. [ History ] The MPSF was founded in 1992 and specifically created to provide an outlet for competition in non-revenue-producing Olympic sports. The MPSF conducts championships in men&apos;s soccer; men&apos;s volleyball; women&apos;s lacrosse; and indoor track, gymnastics, and water polo for both men and women. In 2010 the MPSF added Women&apos;s swimming and diving to their list of sports, and for the 2011-2012 season they have announced Men&apos;s swimming and diving will also be added. The conference&apos;s membership varies by sport; 38 schools are MPSF members in at least one of its sponsored sports. Schools are not required to participate in the MPSF competition for each sponsored sport if their primary conference affiliation sponsors a competition in that sport (e.g. Pac-12 soccer and women&apos;s gymnastics). The majority of MPSF members have a primary conference affiliate. Ten are members of the Pacific-12 Conference (Arizona, Arizona State, California, Colorado, Oregon, Stanford, UCLA, USC, Washington, Washington State), seven are members of the Big West Conference (Cal Poly-SLO, CSU-Northridge, Long Beach State, Pacific, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara), five are members of the West Coast Conference (BYU, Loyola Marymount, Pepperdine, San Diego, St. Mary&apos;s), four are members of the Mountain West Conference (Air Force, New Mexico, San Diego State, UNLV), three are members of the Western Athletic Conference (Fresno State, Hawaii, San Jose State), two are members of the Big Sky Conference (Northern Colorado, Sacramento State), two are members of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference (Alaska-Anchorage, Seattle Pacific), one is a member of the Big 12 Conference (Oklahoma), one is a member of the California Collegiate Athletic Association (UC-San Diego) and one is a member of the Sun Belt Conference (Denver). Two school do not (as of the 2011-12 season) have a primary athletic conference (CSU-Bakersfield, Seattle).
