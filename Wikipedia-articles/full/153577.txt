[ England Clifton 53.97206 -1.09791 12,017 Clifton City of York North Yorkshire Yorkshire and the Humber York Central YORK YO YO30 01904 SE592532 ] Clifton is a suburb of York in the unitary authority of the City of York, in the north of England about 1½ miles from the city centre. The A19, passes north out of York through Clifton. The old village area was made a Conservation Area in 1968. It is the location of Nestle Foods Factory and the Public Schools of St Peter&apos;s and the former Queen Anne&apos;s. The origin of the name is derived from the Olde English pre-7th Century clif, meaning a gentle slope, or more usually a riverbank, with tun, an enclosure or settlement. [ http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/clifton#ixzz18b6RAH9M Name origin 2010-12-19 ] [ History ] During Roman times there was a road through Clifton that approached the Roman fortress from the north west and headed towards the river crossing. There was a second road that also left the north-west gate and may eventually have joined the other. The evidence from early timber buildings from the Museum gardens and early burials from Bootham and Clifton suggest the roads existed from the 1st century. Sporadic 2nd century Roman occupation material and fragments of streets indicate that by that time expansion may have begun in Clifton. This development was not sustained and evidence indicates that from the 3rd century onwards the area beyond St. Mary&apos;s was given over to cemeteries.

Clifton is bounded by the parish of Rawcliffe and Clifton Without to the north, Holgate to the south west, Heworth to the east and Guildhall Ward to the south east. The Ward boundary runs from the River Ouse in the west, opposite Acomb Landing, along the back of the Homestead Park and York Sports Club and across the A19 following Water Lane and Lilbourne Drive. It continues north east along the Bur Dike to behind Burton Green Primary School before heading south east and then east across Bootham Stray, the B1363 and the Nestle Factory to the River Foss. The river forms the eastern boundary as far as Diamond Street and Walpole Street, where it heads west and then south to the junction of Clarence Street with the Haxby and Wigginton Roads. It heads west past the York District Hospital and then south along the York to Scarborough Railway Line until it reaches the River Ouse at Scarborough Bridge. The remainder of the boundary follows the river north west to Acomb Landing. [ Economy ] Most of the population find employment in the city centre or the many retail and industrial parks on the outskirts of York such as Clifton Moor in the nearby area of Clifton Without. Employment can be found within the ward at the Nestle Foods Factory on Haxby Road, and the York District Hospital on Wigginton Road.

The building, comprising half of the intended scheme and costing about £100,000, was opened in 1941 and stood between Huntington Road and Haxby Road. The hospital was next to the Grange and shared facilities, including the nurses&apos; home. The hospital was expanded and renamed York District Hospital in 1977 and from 2010 is now known as The York Hospital.

The Clifton opened on 17 November 1937 with the film “Edge of the World” starring John Laurie, Finlay Currie and Campbell Robson, directed by Michael Powell.
