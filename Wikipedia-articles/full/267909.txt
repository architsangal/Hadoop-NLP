Some chemistry sources define &apos;arachidonic acid&apos; to designate any of the eicosatetraenoic acid s. However, almost all writings in biology, medicine and nutrition limit the term to all-cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. [ Biology ] Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid present in the phospholipid s (especially phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositide s ) of membrane s of the body&apos;s cell s, and is abundant in the brain, muscles, liver. In addition to being involved in cellular signaling as a lipid second messenger involved in the regulation of signaling enzymes, such as PLC -γ, PLC-δ, and PKC -α, -β, and -γ isoforms, arachidonic acid is a key inflammatory intermediate and can also act as a vasodilator. [ Baynes John W. Marek H. Dominiczak Medical Biochemistry 2nd. Edition Elsevier Mosby 2005 555 0-7234-3341-0 ] (Note separate synthetic pathways, as described in section below) [ Essential fatty acid ] [ Essential fatty acid#Essentiality ] Arachidonic acid in the human body usually comes from dietary animal sources —meat, eggs, dairy —or is synthesized from linoleic acid. Arachidonic acid is not one of the essential fatty acid s. However, it does become essential if there is a deficiency in linoleic acid or if there is an inability to convert linoleic acid to arachidonic acid, which is required by most mammal s. Some mammals lack the ability to —or have a very limited capacity to —convert linoleic acid into arachidonic acid, making it an essential part of their diets. Since little or no arachidonic acid is found in common plants, such animals are obligate carnivore s; the cat is a common example. [ MacDonald ML Rogers QR Morris JG Nutrition of the Domestic Cat, a Mammalian Carnivore Annual Review of Nutrition 4 521–62 1984 6380542 10.1146/annurev.nu.04.070184.002513 ] [ Rivers JP Sinclair AJ Craqford MA Inability of the cat to desaturate essential fatty acids 10.1038/258171a0 Nature 1186900 1975 258 5531 171–3 1975Natur.258..171R ] A commercial source of arachidonic acid has been derived, however, from the fungus Mortierella alpina. { History of Martek, Martek.com } [ Synthesis and cascade ] Eicosanoid synthesis. Arachidonic acid is freed from a phospholipid molecule by the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA 2 ), which cleaves off the fatty acid, but can also be generated from DAG by diacylglycerol lipase. Arachidonic acid generated for signaling purposes appears to be derived by the action of a phosphatidylcholine-specific cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA 2, 85 kDa), whereas inflammatory arachidonic acid is generated by the action of a low-molecular-weight secretory PLA 2 (sPLA 2, 14-18 kDa). Arachidonic acid is a precursor in the production of eicosanoid s : [ Walter F., PhD. Boron Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch Elsevier/Saunders 2003 108 1-4160-2328-3 ] The enzymes cyclooxygenase and peroxidase lead to prostaglandin H2, which in turn is used to produce the prostaglandin s, prostacyclin, and thromboxane s. The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase leads to 5-HPETE, which in turn is used to produce the leukotriene s. Arachidonic acid is also used in the biosynthesis of anandamide. Some arachidonic acid is converted into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid s (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid s (EETs) by epoxygenase. The production of these derivatives and their action in the body are collectively known as the &quot; arachidonic acid cascade &quot;; see essential fatty acid interactions for more details. [ PLA 2 activation ] [ Phospholipase_A2#Regulation ] PLA 2, in turn, is activated by ligand binding to receptors, including: [ Walter F., PhD. Boron Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch Elsevier/Saunders 2003 103 1-4160-2328-3 ] 5-HT2 receptor s mGLUR1 bFGF receptor IFN-α receptor IFN-γ receptor Furthermore, any agent increasing intracellular calcium may cause activation of some forms of PLA 2. [ PLC activation ] [ Phospholipase C#Activation ] Alternatively, arachidonic acid may be cleaved from phospholipids by phospholipase C (PLC), yielding diacylglycerol (DAG), which subsequently is cleaved by DAG lipase to yield arachidonic acid. Receptors that activate this pathway include: [ Walter F., PhD. Boron Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch Elsevier/Saunders 2003 104 1-4160-2328-3 ] A1 receptor D2 receptor α-2 adrenergic receptor 5-HT1 receptor PLC may also be activated by MAP kinase. Activators of this pathway include PDGF and FGF. [ Arachidonic acid in the body ] [ Muscle growth ] Through its conversion to active components such as the prostaglandin PGF2alpha, arachidonic acid is necessary for the repair and growth of skeletal muscle tissue. [ 10.1210/jc.86.10.5067 Trappe TA Fluckey JD White F Lambert CP Evans WJ Skeletal muscle PGF(2)(alpha) and PGE(2) in response to eccentric resistance exercise: influence of ibuprofen acetaminophen. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 86 11600586 10 5067–70 2001 ] This role makes ARA an important dietary component in support of the muscle anabolic process. One of the lead researchers of the Baylor study (see Bodybuilding section) on arachidonic acid, Mike Roberts MS, CSCS, has authored an article published under the title Arachidonic Acid, The New Mass Builder explaining the role of this nutrient in muscle anabolism, and its potential for the enhancement of muscle size and strength. { http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/llewellyn2.htm } The paper explains that for optimal muscle growth, a training stimulus must elicit localized inflammation and soreness. It explains that arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) is an essential omega-6 (1-6) polyunsaturated fatty acid that is abundant in skeletal muscle membrane phospholipids (figure 2). It is also the body&apos;s principal building block for the production of prostaglandins, which are known to have various physiological roles, including a close involvement in inflammation. Also, the prostaglandin isomer PGF2a has a potent ability to stimulate muscle growth. As such, arachidonic acid is a regulator of localized muscle inflammation, and may be a central nutrient controlling the intensity of the anabolic/tissue-rebuilding response to weight training. [ Brain ] Arachidonic acid is one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, and is present in similar quantities to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The two account for approximately 20% of its fatty acid content. [ Crawford MA Sinclair AJ Nutritional influences in the evolution of mammalian brain. In: lipids, malnutrition &amp; the developing brain Ciba Foundation symposium 267–92 1971 4949878 ] Like DHA, neurological health is reliant upon sufficient levels of arachidonic acid. Among other things, arachidonic acid helps to maintain hippocampal cell membrane fluidity. [ 16790296 ] It also helps protect the brain from oxidative stress by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. [ Wang ZJ Liang CL Li GM Yu CY Yin M Neuroprotective effects of arachidonic acid against oxidative stress on rat hippocampal slices Chemico-biological interactions 163 3 207–17 2006 16982041 10.1016/j.cbi.2006.08.005 ] ARA also activates syntaxin -3 (STX-3), a protein involved in the growth and repair of neurons. [ Darios F Davletov B Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids stimulate cell membrane expansion by acting on syntaxin 3. Nature 440 7085 813–7 2006 16598260 10.1038/nature04598 2006Natur.440..813D ] Arachidonic acid is also involved in early neurological development. In one study funded by the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, infants (18 months) given supplemental arachidonic acid for 17 weeks demonstrated significant improvements in intelligence, as measured by the Mental Development Index. { Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, March 2000 } [ November 2010 ] This effect is further enhanced by the simultaneous supplementation of ARA with DHA. In adults, the disturbed metabolism of ARA may be associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Bipolar disorder. [ Rapoport SI Arachidonic acid and the brain The Journal of nutrition 138 12 2515–20 2008 19022981 ] This may involve significant alterations in the conversion of arachidonic acid to other bioactive molecules (overexpression or disturbances in the ARA enzyme cascade). Notably, dietary arachidonic acid consumption is not associated with the onset of Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and studies suggest the supplementation of arachidonic acid during the early stages of this disease may actually be effective in reducing symptoms and slowing the disease progress. [ Schaeffer EL Forlenza OV Gattaz WF Phospholipase A2 activation as a therapeutic approach for cognitive enhancement in early-stage Alzheimer disease Psychopharmacology 202 1–3 37–51 2009 18853146 10.1007/s00213-008-1351-0 ] Additional studies on arachidonic acid supplementation for Alzheimer&apos;s patients are needed. [ Bodybuilding supplement ] Arachidonic acid is marketed as an anabolic bodybuilding supplement in a variety of products.

Using repeated measures ANOVA with delta scores, the AA group experienced significantly greater increases in comparison to the PLA group at day 50 (P &lt; 0.05). Statistical trends were seen in Wingate total work (AA: 1,292 ± 1,206 vs. PLA: 510 ± 1,249 J, P = 0.09, ηp 2 = 0.052), favoring the AA group. With regard to inflammation, the paper reported a statistically significant reduction in resting IL-6 levels (a central regulator of inflammation): IL-6 levels experienced a significant group × time interaction (P = 0.04) among groups with subsequent post hoc analyses revealing that IL-6 was significantly lower at day 25 of the study. One-way ANOVA of IL-6 delta values at day 25 revealed significantly greater increases in PLA when compared to AA group (AA: 0.8 ± 13.5 pg·ml-1 vs. PLA: 52.5 ± 1.6 pg·ml-1, P = 0.01; Figure 2) Arachidonic acid was shown to improve peak muscle power, reduce resting IL-6 levels, and produce statistically strong trends of improvements in muscle endurance, average power, and bench press 1-rep maximum lift. This study provided preliminary evidence supporting the use of arachidonic acid in sports nutrition. [ Dietary arachidonic acid and inflammation ] Under normal metabolic conditions, the increased consumption of arachidonic acid is unlikely to increase inflammation. ARA is metabolized to both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules.

Arachidonic acid does still play a central role in inflammation related to injury and many diseased states. How it is metabolized in the body dictates its inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activity. Individuals suffering from joint pains or active inflammatory disease may find that increased arachidonic acid consumption exacerbates symptoms, presumably because it is being more readily converted to inflammatory compounds. Likewise, high arachidonic acid consumption is not advised for individuals with a history of inflammatory disease, or who are in compromised health. Of note, while ARA supplementation does not appear to have proinflammatory effects in healthy individuals, it may counter the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.

In fact, the paper recommends individuals follow a diet that consists of at least 5-10% of calories coming from omega-6 fats, including arachidonic acid. Dietary ARA is not a risk factor for heart disease, and may play a role in maintaining optimal metabolism and reduced heart disease risk. It is, therefore, recommended to maintain sufficient intake levels of both omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids for optimal health. Arachidonic acid is not carcinogenic, and studies show dietary level is not associated (positively or negatively) with risk of cancers.
