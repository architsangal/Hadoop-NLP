In differential geometry, the exterior derivative extends the concept of the differential of a function, which is a 1-form, to differential form s of higher degree. Its current form was invented by Élie Cartan. The exterior derivative d has the property that [ d 2 = 0 ] and is the differential (coboundary) used to define de Rham cohomology on forms. Integration of forms gives a natural homomorphism from the de Rham cohomology to the singular cohomology of a smooth manifold. The theorem of de Rham shows that this map is actually an isomorphism. In this sense, the exterior derivative is the &quot; dual &quot; of the boundary map on singular simplices. [ Definition ] The exterior derivative of a differential form of degree k is a differential form of degree [ k+ 1. ] There are a variety of equivalent definitions of the exterior derivative. [ Exterior derivative of a function ] If ƒ is a smooth function, then the exterior derivative of ƒ is the differential of ƒ. That is, dƒ is the unique one-form such that for every smooth vector field X, [ d &amp; fnof;(X) = X &amp; fnof; ], where Xƒ is the directional derivative of ƒ in the direction of X. Thus the exterior derivative of a function (or 0-form) is a one-form. [ Exterior derivative of a k-form ] The exterior derivative is defined to be the unique R-linear mapping from k-forms to (k+1)-forms satisfying the following properties: [ d(d &amp; fnof;) = 0 ] [ d( &amp; alpha; &amp; and; &amp; beta;) = d &amp; alpha; &amp; and; &amp; beta;+ ( &amp; minus;1) p ( &amp; alpha; &amp; and;d &amp; beta;) ] dƒ is the differential of ƒ for smooth functions ƒ. for any smooth function ƒ. where α is a p-form. That is to say, d is an antiderivation of degree 1 on the exterior algebra of differential forms. The second defining property holds in more generality: in fact, [ d(d &amp; alpha;) = 0 ] for any k-form α. This is part of the Poincaré lemma. The third defining property implies as a special case that if ƒ is a function and α a k-form, then [ d( &amp; fnof; &amp; alpha;) = d &amp; fnof; &amp; and; &amp; alpha;+ &amp; fnof; &amp; and;d &amp; alpha; ] because functions are forms of degree 0. [ Exterior derivative in local coordinates ] Alternatively, one can work entirely in a local coordinate system (x 1,...,x n ). First, the coordinate differentials dx 1,...,dx n form a basic set of one-forms within the coordinate chart. Given a multi-index [ I = (i1,...,ik ) ] with [ 1 &amp; le; i p &amp; le; n ] for [ 1 &amp; le; p &amp; le; k ], the exterior derivative of a k-form \omega = f_I\text{d}x^I=f_{i_1,i_2\cdots i_k}\text{d}x^{i_1}\wedge \text{d}x^{i_2}\wedge\cdots\wedge \text{d}x^{i_k} over R n is defined as \text{d}{\omega} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial x^i} \text{d}x^i \wedge \text{d}x^I. For general k-forms [ &amp; omega;= &amp; Sigma; I fI dxI ] (where the components of the multi-index I run over all the values in {1,..., n}), the definition of the exterior derivative is extended linear ly. Note that whenever i is one of the components of the multi-index I then [ dxi &amp; and;dxI = 0 ] (see wedge product ). The definition of the exterior derivative in local coordinates follows from the preceding definition. Indeed, if [ &amp; omega;= &amp; fnof;I dxi 1 &amp; and;... &amp; and;dxi k ], then = \text{d}f_I \wedge (\text{d}x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \text{d}x^{i_k}) + f_I \text{d}(\text{d}x^{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge \text{d}x^{i_k}) = \text{d}f_I \wedge \text{d}x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \text{d}x^{i_k} + \sum_{p=1}^k (-1)^{(p-1)}f_I \text{d}x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \text{d}x^{i_{p-1}}\wedge \text{d}^2x^{i_p} \wedge \text{d}x^{i_{p+1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge \text{d}x^{i_k} = \text{d}f_I \wedge \text{d}x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \text{d}x^{i_k} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial x^i} \text{d}x^i \wedge \text{d}x^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \text{d}x^{i_k} Here, we have here interpreted ƒ I as a zero-form, and then applied the properties of the exterior derivative. [ Invariant formula ] Alternatively, an explicit formula can be given for the exterior derivative of a k-form ω, when paired with k+1 arbitrary smooth vector field s V 0,V 1,..., V k &apos;&apos;: \text{d}\omega(V_0,...,V_k) = \sum_i(-1)^{i} V_i\left(\omega(V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots,V_k)\right) +\sum_{i &lt; j}(-1)^{i+j}\omega([V_i, V_j], V_0, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots, \hat V_j, \ldots, V_k) where [V_i,V_j] denotes Lie bracket and the hat denotes the omission of that element: \omega(V_1, \ldots, \hat V_i, \ldots,V_k) = \omega(V_1, \ldots, V_{i-1}, V_{i+1}, \ldots, V_k). In particular, for 1-forms we have: [ d &amp; omega;(X,Y) = X &amp; omega;(Y) &amp; minus; Y &amp; omega;(X) &amp; minus; &amp; omega;([X,Y]) ], where X and Y are vector fields. [ Examples ] 1 Consider [ &amp; sigma;= udx1 &amp; and;dx2 ] over a 1-form basis [ dx1,...,dxn ].The exterior derivative is: = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} dx^i\right) \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2 = \sum_{i=3}^n \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x^i} dx^i \wedge dx^1 \wedge dx^2\right) The last formula follows easily from the properties of the wedge product. Namely, dx^i \wedge dx^i = 0. 2 For a 1-form [ &amp; sigma;= udx+ vdy ] defined over R 2. We have, by applying the above formula to each term (consider [ x1 = x ] and [ x2 = y ] ) the following sum, =\left(\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}} \text{d}x \wedge \text{d}x + \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}} \text{d}y \wedge \text{d}x\right) + \left(\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} \text{d}x \wedge \text{d}y + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}} \text{d}y \wedge \text{d}y\right) = 0 -\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}} \text{d}x \wedge \text{d}y + \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} \text{d}x \wedge \text{d}y + 0 = \left(\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}} - \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}\right) \text{d}x \wedge \text{d}y. [ Further properties ] [ Closed and exact forms ] [ Closed and exact forms ] Differential forms in the kernel of d are called closed form s. The image of d are called exact form s. Closed and exact forms are related, because of the identity [ d(d &amp; alpha;) = 0 ] for any k-form α. This implies that every exact form is closed. The converse is true in contractible regions, by the Poincaré lemma. [ Naturality ] The exterior derivative is natural. If [ &amp; fnof;: M→ N ] is a smooth map and Ω k is the contravariant smooth functor that assigns to each manifold the space of k-forms on the manifold, then the following diagram commutes center so [ d( &amp; fnof;*ω) = &amp; fnof;*dω, ] where ƒ* denotes the pullback of ƒ. This follows from that ƒ*ω(·), by definition, is ω(ƒ (·)), ƒ being the pushforward of ƒ. Thus d is a natural transformation from Ω k to Ω k+1. [ The exterior derivative in calculus ] Most vector calculus operators are special cases of, or have close relationships to, the notion of exterior differentiation. [ Gradient ] A smooth function f: R n → R is a 0-form. The exterior derivative of this 0-form is the 1-form \mathrm{d}f = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\, \mathrm{d}x^i = \langle \nabla f,\cdot \rangle. That is, the form dƒ acts on any vector field V by outputting, at each point, the scalar product of V with the gradient ∇ƒ of ƒ&apos;&apos;. The 1-form dƒ is a section of the cotangent bundle, that gives a local linear approximation to ƒ in the cotangent space at each point. [ Divergence ] A vector field V = (v 1, v 2,... v n ) on R n has a corresponding (n-1)-form \omega _V = v_1 \; (\mathrm{d}x^2 \wedge \mathrm{d}x^3 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n) - v_2 \; (\mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \mathrm{d}x^3 \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n) + \cdots + (-1)^{n-1}v_n \; (\mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{n-1}) =\sum_{p=1}^n{(-1)^{(p-1)}v_p(\mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{p-1} \wedge \widehat{\mathrm{d}x^{p}} \wedge \mathrm{d}x^{p+1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n)}. where \widehat{\mathrm{d}x^{p}} denotes the omission of that element. (For instance, when n = 3, in three-dimensional space, the 2-form ω V is locally the scalar triple product with V.) The integral of ω V over a hypersurface is the flux of V over that hypersurface. The exterior derivative of this (n &amp; minus;1)-form is the n-form \mathrm{d} \omega _V = \operatorname{div}(V) \; (\mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \mathrm{d}x^2 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n). [ Curl ] A vector field V on R n also has a corresponding 1-form \eta_V = v_1 \; \mathrm{d}x^1 + v_2 \; \mathrm{d}x^2 + \cdots + v_n \; \mathrm{d}x^n., Locally, η V is the dot product with V. The integral of η V along a path is the work done against -V along that path. When n = 3, in three-dimensional space, the exterior derivative of the 1-form η V is the 2-form \mathrm{d} \eta_V = \omega _{\operatorname{curl}(V)}. [ Invariant formulations of grad, curl, div, and Laplacian ] The three operators above can be written in coordinate-free notation as follows: \begin{array}{rcccl} \operatorname{grad}(f) &amp; = &amp; \nabla f &amp; = &amp; \left( {\mathbf d} f \right)^\sharp \\ \operatorname{div}(F) &amp; = &amp; \nabla \cdot F &amp; = &amp; \star {\mathbf d} \left( \star F^\flat \right) \\ \operatorname{curl}(F) &amp; = &amp; \nabla \times F &amp; = &amp; \left[ \star \left( {\mathbf d} F^\flat \right) \right]^\sharp, \\ \Delta f &amp; = &amp; \nabla^2 f &amp; = &amp; \star {\mathbf d} \left( \star {\mathbf d} f \right) \\ \end{array} where \star is the Hodge star operator and \flat and \sharp are the musical isomorphism s.
