{ Poliudie &apos;&apos;, by } { Nicholas Roerich, 1908 (Moscow). } A tribute (from Latin tributum, contribution) is wealth, often in kind, that one party gives to another as a sign of respect or, as was often the case in historical contexts, of submission or allegiance. Various ancient states, which could be called suzerains, exacted tribute from areas they had conquered or threatened to conquer. In case of alliance s, lesser parties gave tribute to the dominant parties as a sign of allegiance and for the purposes of financing the agreed projects - usually raising an army. The term may also be used on religious tax used for maintenance of temple s and other sacred places. Athens received tribute from the other cities of the Delian League. The empires of Assyria, Babylon, Carthage and Rome exacted tribute from their province s and subject kingdoms. Ancient China received tribute from various states such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Indonesia, South Asia and Central Asia.

Lockard Cengage Learning 2007 0-618-38612-2 ] The Roman republic also exacted tribute in the form of payments equivalent to proportional property tax es for the purpose of waging war. [ Chinese practice of tributes as trade regulation and authority ] [ List of tributaries of Imperial China ] In China, the tribute system began from ancient China period to provide both an administrative means to control their interests, as well as a means of providing exclusive trading priorities to those who paid tribute from foreign regions. It was an integral part of the Confucian philosophy and was seen by the Chinese as equivalent to the familial relation of younger sons looking after older parents by devoting part of their wealth, assets, or goods to that purpose. Political marriages also existed between the Chinese empire and tribute states, such as Songtsen Gampo and Wencheng (Gyasa). China often received tribute from the states under the influence of Confucian civilization and gave them Chinese products and recognition of their authority and sovereignty in return. There were several tribute states to the Chinese-established empires throughout ancient history, including neighboring countries such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Indonesia, South Asia and Central Asia. This tributary system and relationship are well known as Jimi (羁縻) or Cefeng (册封), or Chaogong (朝貢). In Japanese, the tributary system and relationship is referred to as Shinkou (進貢), Sakuhou (冊封) and Choukou (朝貢). According to the Chinese Book of Han, the various tribes of Japan (constituting the nation of Wa ) had already entered into tributary relationships with China by the first century. { 後漢書, 會稽海外有東鯷人 分爲二十餘國 } However, Japan ceased to present tribute to China and left the tributary system during the Heian period without damaging economic ties. Although Japan eventually returned to the tributary system during the Muromachi period, it did not recommence presenting tribute.

This evidence points to the fact that at this period Japan was inside the Chinese tribute system. Japanese missions to the Sui (581-604) and Tang Dynasties were recognized by the Chinese as bearers of imperial tribute;however in the middle of ninth century - the early Heian period - Japan rescinded the sending missions to the Tang Empire. ] [ http://www.chinajapan.org/articles/15/mizuno15.108-144.pdf China in Tokugawa Foreign Relations: The Tokugawa Bakufu&apos;s Perception of and Attitudes toward Ming-Qing China 109 Mizuno Norihito Ohio State University 2003 It was not that Japan, as China’s neighbor, had had nothing to do with or been indifferent to hierarchical international relations when seeking relationships with China or the constituents of the Chinese world order. It had sporadically paid tribute to Chinese dynasties in ancient and medieval times but had usually not been a regular vassal state of China. It had obviously been one of the countries most reluctant to participate in the Sinocentric world order. Japan did not identify itself as a vassal state of China during most of its history, no matter how China saw it. ] According to the Korean historical document Samguk Sagi (삼국사기, 三國史記), Goguryeo sent a diplomatic representative to the Han Dynasty in 32 AD, and the Emperor Guangwu of Han granted the official rank of Goguryeo. { ≪삼국사기≫에 의하면 32년(고구려 대무신왕 15)에 후한으로 사신을 보내어 조공을 바치니 후한의 광무제(光武帝)가 왕호를 회복시켜주었다는 기록이 있다 («Tang» 32 years, according to (Goguryeo Daemusin 15) sent ambassadors to the generous tribute to the Emperor Guangwu of Han Emperor in abundance (光武帝) gave evidence that can restore wanghoreul -- Google translation?) } The tributary relationship between China and Korea was established during the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

(2008). } [ IvqVxwpDK2UC Encyclopedia Small Silver Coins,p. 331. 331 ] During the period before the Japanese invasion into Korea, the geopolitics of East Asia were ruled by the Chinese tributary system. This assured them their sovereignty and the system assured China the incoming of certain valuable assets. &quot; The theoretical justification &quot; for this exchange was the Mandate of Heaven, that stated the fact that the Emperor of China was empowered by the heavens to rule, and with this rule the whole mankind would end up being beneficiary of good deeds. Mostly of the Asian countries would join this system voluntary. There is a clear differentiation between the term &quot; tribute &quot; and &quot; gift. &quot; The former, known as gong (貢), has important connotations. The Chinese emperors made sure that the gifts they paid to other states were known as mere gifts, not tributes. Even at times when a Chinese dynasty had to bribe nomads from raiding their border such as in the Han Dynasty and the Song Dynasty, the emperors gave &quot; gifts &quot; to the Xiongnu and the Khitan. The only time when a dynasty paid formal tribute to another was during the southern Song dynasty, where tribute was given to the Jin Dynasty for peace. The Jin Dynasty also saw itself as the legitimate holder of the &quot; Mandate of Heaven &quot;. In addition, the Zheng He expeditions also carried goods to build tribute relationships between the Ming Dynasty and newly discovered kingdoms. Tribute activities occupy several chapters in the Twenty-Four Histories. [ Islamic notions of tribute ] [ Jizya ] The Islamic Caliphate introduced a new form of tribute, known as the &apos; jizya &apos;, that differed significantly from earlier Roman forms of tribute. According to Patricia Seed: [ Ceremonies of Possession in Europe&apos;s Conquest of the New World, 1492-1640 Patricia Seed 1995 Cambridge University Press 0-521-49757-4 80 ] Christians of the Iberian Peninsula translated the term &apos;jizya&apos; as tributo. This form of tribute was later also applied by the Spanish and Portuguese empires to their territories in the New World. [ Ceremonies of Possession in Europe&apos;s Conquest of the New World, 1492-1640 Patricia Seed 1995 Cambridge University Press 0-521-49757-4 80–1 ] [ Western European notions of tribute in medieval times ] The Tribute Money, George Hayter, 1817 Raid ers, like Vikings and Celt ic tribes, could also exact tribute instead of raiding the place if the potential targets agreed to pay an agreed amount of valuables. Tribute was not always money, but also valuables, effectively making the payers hostage s kept unpillaged in exchange for good behaviour. Various medieval lords required tribute from their vassal s or peasants, nominally in exchange for protection to incur the costs of raising armies, or paying for free-lance mercenaries against a hostile neighbouring state. That system evolved into medieval taxation and co-existed as a secular approximation of the churchly tithe levied on production. During the Spanish Reconquista, there were periods when the Christian kings were more militarily powerful than the Moors, but lacked the population to settle and defend the conquered territories. They were content with receiving tribute, the parias. Combined with commerce across the Mediterranean, parias was a means for African wares like gold to enter Europe. [ Tribute in the modern era ] Modern elements of tribute are restricted to highly formal and ceremonial rituals, such as: formal gifts being given to prove either fealty or loyalty upon the inauguration of a president; a wedding of a president&apos;s child while the president is in office; the accession or the marriage of a member of a royal family; and even in those show business marriages that are largely staged, where studios, banks, and other stars prove their loyalty through expensive gifts in the hope of future benefits, which if not given will result in loss of business. Thus, the element of duress and coercion seen in earlier times is part of this process, particularly in Hollywood. [ June 2007 ] In general use, the phrase &quot; to pay tribute &quot; often means &quot; to praise or laud &quot;, whether or not an accompanying gift (the historical understanding of &quot; tribute &quot; ) is provided.
