Karenga was a major figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s and co-founded with Hakim Jamal the black nationalist and social change organization US which means &quot; Us Black people &quot;.

Black Power in the Belly of the Beast 74–5 University of Illinois Press Chicago ] US continues to be active in local, national and international issues of social justice and social change, working within the framework of the philosophy Kawaida developed by Karenga. [ Background and education ] Ron Everett was born on a farm in Parsonsburg, Maryland, the fourteenth child and seventh son. He moved to California in the late 1950s to attend UCLA, but attended Los Angeles City College (LACC) to establish residence. There, he became the first African-American president of the student body. After graduation from LACC, he went to University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where he received his B.A. and M.A. in political science with a specialization in African studies. (Maulana Karenga, Los Angeles: UCLA Center for African American Studies, Oral History Program, 2002) He was awarded his first Ph.D. in 1976 from United States International University (now known as Alliant International University ) for a 170-page dissertation entitled Afro-American Nationalism: Social Strategy and Struggle for Community. Later in his career, in 1994, he was awarded a second Ph.D., in social ethics, from the University of Southern California (USC), for an 803-page dissertation entitled &quot; Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics. &quot; [ Career ] Dr. Karenga is the Chair of the Africana Studies Department at California State University, Long Beach. He is the director of the Kawaida Institute for Pan African Studies and the author of several books, including his &quot; Introduction to Black Studies &quot;, a comprehensive Black/African Studies textbook now in its fourth edition. Karenga founded the Organization Us, a cultural black nationalist group, in 1965. He is also known for having co-hosted, in 1984, a conference that gave rise to the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations, and in 1995, he sat on the organizing committee and authored the mission statement of the Million Man March. [ Influences of Malcolm X ] Karenga was influenced in the creation of his ethos for US by Malcolm X. &quot; Malcolm was the major African American thinker that influenced me in terms of nationalism and Pan-Africanism. As you know, towards the end, when Malcolm is expanding his concept of Islam, and of nationalism, he stresses Pan-Africanism in a particular way. And he argues that, and this is where we have the whole idea that cultural revolution and the need for revolution, he argues that we need a cultural revolution, he argues that we must return to Africa culturally and spiritually, even if we can’t go physically. And so that’s a tremendous impact on US. And US saw it, when I founded it, as the sons and daughters of Malcolm, and as an heir to his legacy. &quot; —Maulana Karenga [ http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex%3D378%26amp%3Bcategory%3DeducationMakers &quot; The History Makers &quot; Maulana Karenga Malcolm X ] [ Us and COINTELPRO ] During the 1960s, Us became a target of the FBI COINTELPRO and was put on a series of lists describing it as dangerous, revolutionary and committed to armed struggle in the Black Power Movement. [ COINTELPRO -- Black Nationalist Hate Groups (1967-1971) http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/blacknationalist.htm FBI COINTELPRO Documents 28 September 2011 ] Us developed a youth component with para-military aspects called the Simba Wachanga which advocated and practiced community self-defense and service to the masses. Similar to the Black Panthers in their claim to be a revolutionary vanguard, Us at first cooperated with the Panthers and other community groups in Black United Front efforts. However, there evolved ideological differences that the FBI through its COINTELPRO began to increase and aggravate, leading to physical conflicts. Tactics used to foment and aggravate conflict between Us and the Panthers included poison-pen letters, defamatory cartoons, agents provocateurs, and creating suspicion of members of each organization as agents.

Community efforts to resolve the conflict, both before and after the shooting, were conducted by the Black Congress of Los Angeles, but were unsuccessful. The FBI and local police used this state of things to further suppress both groups driving Us members and Panthers underground and in exile and putting them in prison under questionable circumstances. { FBI file on Maulana Karenga, 157-724, Memo March 21, 1968 } As noted above, Karenga argues that he was a victim of these tactics and that his imprisonment was political. { Asante, Molefi Kete (2009), pp. 10-14.

Lawrence The Dartmouth Review The Story of Kwanzaa January 15, 2001 http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/767.html ] One of the victims gave testimony of how Karenga and other men tortured her and another woman. The woman claimed to have been stripped and beaten with an electrical cord. Karenga&apos;s former wife, Brenda Lorraine Karenga, testified that he sat on the other woman’s stomach while another man forced water into her mouth through a hose. A May 14, 1971, article in the Los Angeles Times described the testimony of one of the women: &quot; Deborah Jones, who once was given the Swahili title of an African queen, said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes. She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis&apos; mouth and placed against Miss Davis&apos; face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vise. Karenga, head of US, also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths, she said. They also were hit on the heads with toasters. &quot; Karenga explained his actions by saying that one of the women he had tortured had attempted to assassinate him, but he had no evidence.

The Us organization fell into disarray during his absence and was disbanded in 1974. After he petitioned several black state officials to support his parole on fair sentencing grounds, it was granted in 1975. [ &quot; Whatever happened to... Ron Karenga Ebony September 1975 30 11 170 ] [ Kawaida, the Nguzo Saba, and Kwanzaa ] After his parole Karenga re-established the Us organization under a new structure. One year later, he was awarded his first doctorate. In 1977, he formulated a set of principles called Kawaida, a Swahili term for normal. Karenga called on African Americans to adopt his secular humanism and reject other practices as mythical (Karenga 1977, pp.  14, 23, 24, 27, 44–5). Central to Karenga&apos;s doctrine are the Nguzo Saba, the Seven Principles of Blackness, which are reinforced during the seven days of Kwanzaa: Umoja (unity) —To strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race. Kujichagulia (self-determination) —To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves, and speak for ourselves. Ujima (collective work and responsibility) —To build and maintain our community together and make our brother&apos;s and sister&apos;s problems our problems and to solve them together. Ujamaa (cooperative economics) —To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together. Nia (purpose) —To make our collective vocation the building and development of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness. Kuumba (creativity) —To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it. Imani (faith) —To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders, and the righteousness and victory of our struggle. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Maulana Karenga on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. { Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). 100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Amherst, New York. Prometheus Books. ISBN 1-57392-963-8. } [ Films ] Karenga starred in Motherland, a sequel to 500 Years Later.
