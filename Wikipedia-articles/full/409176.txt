[ November 2011 ] [ December 2011 ] By its constitution, Egypt has a multi-party system, however in practice the National Democratic Party was the long-time ruling party and dominated the Egyptian political arena up until the Egyptian Revolution in 2011 which ousted NDP President Hosni Mubarak. Under Mubarak, opposition parties were allowed, but were wir. As of February 11, 2011, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has governed Egypt.

The legislation has still however been criticized as discriminatory. Under the law new parties are now required to have at least 5000 members from at least ten of Egypt&apos;s provinces. Originally new parties were only required to have 1000 members. This was cited as a barrier for new parties before parliamentary elections which took place at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012.

[ History ] Emergence of political parties in Egypt in the 20th century was a reflection of social, economic, and cultural interactions as well as certain historical, national and political circumstances, leading to the creation and development of modern institutions of government administration and society, such as the parliament, cabinets, political parties, syndicates, etc. This emergence has been gradual and has gone through successive stages. Political parties have firstly been formed as secret societies that were followed by formation of political groups. The National Party, not to be confused with the later National Democratic Party (NDP), was the first party, formed in 1907 by Scott Crawford. In less than ten years, there was a great variety in these parties; in their nature, formation, organization, power, their popular base and platforms. There were national parties, groups dominated by the royal palace, others formed by the occupation authority as well as ideological parties expressing certain ideologies. In 1907 – 1920, the already-formed political parties in Egypt were a starting signal for the dissemination of further parties; however, they were restricted due to the British occupation and Egyptian subordination to the Ottoman Empire. The February 1922 Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence and the issuance of the 1923 Constitution led to the establishment of a royal constitutional rule based on party pluralism and the principles of liberal democracy. During 1923 – 1952, Egypt witnessed a remarkable experience rich in political and democratic practices, however, such an experience was marked with many defects such as the British occupation, foreign intervention in Egypt&apos;s affairs and the royal palace&apos;s interference in political life. With the outbreak of the July 1952 Revolution, the Egyptian regime worked to liquidate the opposition. In January 1953, an enactment was adopted on disbanding the political parties and adoption of the one-party rule. The enactment of the parties&apos; law in 1977 demonstrated Egypt&apos;s political regime officially turned into the era of party pluralism. [ Political parties and groups ] Egyptian politics are subject to unique circumstances and often defy simple classification in terms of the political spectrum. There are currently over 20 registered political parties in Egypt. Groups are sometimes associated with the political left or right, especially in international circles, according to their stance on issues. While the current Egyptian constitution prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion, there are parties that seek to establish Islamic sharia laws, or uphold the article in the constitution that states that sharia law is the main source of legislation, and others that support the formation of a secular state. The following is a categorization of political parties based on their social, economical, and political orientation, as well as their legal status: [ Explainer: Egypt&apos;s crowded political arena http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/egypt/2011/11/2011111510295463645.html Al Jazeera English 25 November 2011 ] [ Egypt Elections: How would you vote?
