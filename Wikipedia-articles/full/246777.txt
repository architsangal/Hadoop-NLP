The Giro is one of the three Grand Tours (the others being the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España ), and is part of the UCI World Ranking calendar. It is the second most prominent stage race in the world (after the Tour), and along with the Tour and the Road World Cycling Championship it makes up the Triple Crown of Cycling. { http://www.kmenozzi.com/1/post/2011/5/13-facts-about-il-giro-ditalia.html } [ History ] [ 1908–1909: Creation and first edition ] The origin of the Giro d&apos;Italia is similar to that of the Tour de France. It began because of a competition between two newspapers, La Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere della Sera. La Gazzetta dello Sport wished to boost its circulation by holding a professional road race, like the Tour de France. Corriere della Sera wanted to increase its circulation by holding an organized car rally. On 7 August 1908 the newspaper&apos;s founder Eugenio Camillo Costamagna, director Armando Cougnet, and its editor Tullio Morgagni announced the inaugural Giro d&apos;Italia to be held in 1909. Corriere della Sera offered a winners bonus of 3,000 lire.

The race was split into eight stages covering 2448 kilometres. A total of 49 riders finished, with Italian Luigi Ganna winning the inaugural event. Ganna won three individual stages and the General Classification. Ganna received 5325 Lira as a winner’s prize, with all riders in the classification receiving 300 lira (at the time the Giro&apos;s director received 150 lira a month salary) [ http://www.gazzetta.it/dyn/dyn/speciali/giro2001_r2/ciclismo_fr/storia/index_albori.shtml Origines du Giro gazzetta.it 15 September 2010 ]. [ 1910–1924: Italian confirmation ] During this period (and until 1950 with the victory of the Swiss Hugo Koblet ), the ranking of the Giro was exclusively Italian. Regarding stage victories, Stage 2 of the 1910 Giro d&apos;Italia was the first to see a non-Italian win, Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq, from France, was the first non-Italian to win a stage in the Giro d&apos;Italia. In 1912, the ranking was done by teams and again saw the Italians win, this time with team Atala (best team already in 1910 ). Of the 107 stages of the first 11 routes, 102 of the stages were won by Italian riders. It was in 1919, when the first non-Italian made it on to the podium in the Giro. A Belgian, Marcel Buysse, placed third overall in the General Classification in the 1919 edition of the Giro. Two firsts also occurred during this period: in 1911 Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two consecutive Giros. Galetti won the Giro d&apos;Italia in 1910 and 1911. Galetti was also a member of Team Atala, when the won the Giro d&apos;Italia in 1912. The 1911 Giro d&apos;Italia was the first Giro d&apos;Italia to not start or finish in Milan. Rome was given the privilege to host the start and finish of the Giro, in order to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the unification of Italy. [ 1925–1935: The Binda age ] Nicknamed the sitting climber &quot;, Alfredo Binda, won his first Giro d&apos;Italia in 1925. Binda won the sixth stage of the 1925 Giro when he was only 23 years old. The following year, 1926, Binda won six stages out of the twelve possible, but he ended up losing to Giovanni Brunero. Brunero placed third overall in the 1925 Giro. By winning the 1926 edition of the race, Brunero became the first rider to win three Giro d&apos;Italias. Alfredo Binda took his revenge by winning the 1927 Giro. He dominated the field by winning twelve out of the fifteen stages that composed the race that year. Binda&apos;s record of twelve stage wins in a single Giro d&apos;Italia is still intact to this day. Giovanni Brunero claimed second place overall, finishing the Giro more than 27 minutes behind Binda. As Costante Girardengo did in 1919, Binda was the leader of the Giro d&apos;Italia from the first stage to the last stage of the race. Binda also won the first Men&apos;s Road Race at the 1927 Road World Championships and the Giro d&apos;Italia in the same year. In 1928 Alfredo Binda was untouchable and won his third edition of the Giro. That victory tied him with Giovanni Brunero for the most overall victories of the Giro d&apos;Italia, each had three tour victories to their name. Binda won six out of the twelve stages that composed the race. The eighth stage was won by his brother, and teammate, Albino Binda. The 1928 edition of the Giro d&apos;Italia was also the one that gathered the largest number of participants, 298 started the race. The following year, 1929, Binda became the first rider to win his fourth Giro d&apos;Italias. During the 1929 Giro, Binda won a total of eight consecutive stages en route to his fourth overall victory. Domenico Piemontesi finished second overall that year, with almost four more minutes of racing than Binda. Three other riders finished with a total time within ten minutes of Binda&apos;s [ http://paris.thover.com/article/142/fr/le-parcours-du-giro-d-italia-2009---le-tour-d-italie-fete-son-100eme-anniversaire-comme-il-se-doit.html le Tour d&apos;Italie fête son 100ème anniversaire comme il se doit paris.thover.com 15 September 2010 ]. { Alfredo Binda, five time winner of the Giro } In 1930, the race organizers paid Alfredo Binda, winner of three consecutive Giro d&apos;Italias, 22,500 lire to not participate in the race. Binda accepted the race organizers&apos; offer and did not compete. Luigi Marchisio took advantage of Binda&apos;s absence and won the Giro. By winning, he became the youngest rider to ever win the Giro d&apos;Italia. Marchisio was 21 years old when he won the 1930 Giro d&apos;Italia. His record was later eclipsed by the winner of the 1940 Giro d&apos;Italia, Fausto Coppi. Binda consoled himself that year by winning his second title of World Champion and two stages in the 1930 Tour de France. He returned to 1931 for the 20th edition of the Giro. This edition was particularly marked by the appearance of pink jersey (Maglia rosa) that is given to the overall leader. Its colour was the same as the newspaper that sponsored the race, La Gazzetta dello Sport. The Italian Learco Guerra, winner of the 1st stage of the Giro was the first to wear it. Guerra won a total of four stages in the 1931 Giro d&apos;Italia. For his return on Italian roads, Alfredo Binda won and took the pink jersey by winning the third and fourth stages. Binda lost the pink jersey after the end of the sixth stage. Binda suffered a fall in the vicinity of Racecourse Villa Glori in Stage 7, that linked Rome and Perugia. The injuries sustained from the crash forced him to abandon the day after. Francesco Camusso, the winner of the eleventh stage, became the first rider in history to wear the Giro&apos;s pink jersey in Milan. The 1932 Giro was a disappointment for Binda. He finished in seventh place overall, finishing 19 minutes behind the winner, Antonio Pesenti, winner of the event, which ends at 4 instead of the 1932 Tour de France the same year. Hermann Buse, winner of the second stage became the first non-Italian to take the pink jersey, he lost it after the seventh stage to Pesenti. 1933 marked a turning point for the Giro with the appearance of King of the Mountains Classification and the first individual time trial (ITT). The first individual time trial took place on the thirteenth stage, between Bologna and Ferrara at a distance of 62  km long. The time trial was won by Alfredo Binda. In addition, the Giro consisted of seventeen stages, it typically was composed of twelve stages per Giro, closing in the format &quot; Grand Tour &quot; today. Unlike the previous year, the Giro was dominated again by Alfredo Binda, who returned to top form by winning the overall, King of the Mountains Classification, and six stages from 13 days in rose. This victory was Binda&apos;s fifth overall victory of the Giro d&apos;Italia, a record that still stands today. His record of five victories has since been reached by Eddy Merckx and Fausto Coppi. Alfredo Binda returned a favorite to the 1934 Giro d&apos;Italia, but again, he was forced to withdraw due to injuries sustained from a crash. This time Binda was forced to retire during the sixth stage after a nasty fall. Binda was wounded by a pedal on his bicycle and he was then hit by a motorcycle Police. { http://ouestfrance.cd-script.fr/opdf/1934/05/26/85/1934-05-26_85_07.pdf } This 22nd edition was dominated by Learco Guerra called the locomotive won the General Classification, along with ten of the seventeen stages that made up the 1934 Giro d&apos;Italia. However, Francesco Camusso finished second just 51 seconds behind Guerra. Camusso lost the pink jersey during the fourteenth stage, which was an individual time trial. The 1935 Giro d&apos;Italia was the last for Alfredo Binda at the age of 32 years. This Giro was also the first Giro d&apos;Italia for twenty year old, Gino Bartali, who would soon make a big name for himself in the world of cycling. Binda finished the Giro in sixteenth place, finishing 31 minutes behind the winner, Vasco Bergamaschi. Bergamaschi won two stages en route to his overall victory. The young Bartali won the sixth stage and the King of the Mountains Classification. The succession of Binda remains to establish the approach of the edition of 1936. Binda would go down in history as the Giro&apos;s first rider to win five Giro d&apos;Italia&apos;s (a record since equaled but never broken), and also by winning 41 stages of the Giro. Mario Cipollini has been the only one to surpass Binda&apos;s record of 41 stage wins, Cipollini won a record total of 42 stage wins of the Giro during his career. [ 1936–1953: Bartali-Coppi duel ] { Fausto Coppi, five times winner of the Giro } In 1936, the hierarchy had to be rebuilt, after the departure of Alfredo Binda. Learco Guerra winner of the 1934 edition, abandoned the race after breaking his arm. Gino Bartali won a total of three stages to help secure his victory in the 1936 Giro. Bartali won at age of 21, his first Giro d&apos;Italia and his second King of the Mountains Classification in a row. Bartali repeated by winning both classifications in the 1937 Giro d&apos;Italia. The 1937 Giro d&apos;Italia was the first composed of 23 stages for a total of 3840  km and the first to use the roads of the Dolomite which made the reputation of the Giro, the Passo di Costalunga and Passo Rolle. Gino Bartali crossed in front and won the big mountain stage of the Dolomite.

A fellow Italian, Giovanni Valetti, won the Giro in 1938. In the 1939 Giro d&apos;Italia, Gino Bartali and Giovanni Valetti competed on the road. Both riders won a total of four stages. Valetti won the Giro by winning a critical Stage 16. The decisive stage victory gave him the lead and the pink jersey. The climbs of the Passo Pordoi and Falzarego are also emerged in mind, both climbed by Bartali [ http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/article/Le_Giro_a_100_ans/11018987 Le Giro a 100 ans larousse.fr 16 September 2010 ] 100. In 1940 Bartali surrounded himself in his team Legnano, containing a young 20 year old Italian, Fausto Coppi. Coppi took advantage of the fall of his team leader, Bartali, by showing his power and shining in the eleventh stage. Coppi&apos;s performance on the stage informed the general public of his ability. Coppi made the difference over his rivals, on the rise of Abletone and after 100  km the stage win moved allowed him to take the pink jersey. Despite two stage wins in Stage 17 and 19, Bartali was not able to retake the lead. With Coppi taking the overall victory, Bartali consoled himself by winning the King of the Mountains Classification. World War II interrupted the running of the Giro d&apos;Italia between the years of 1941 and 1945, thus curbing the ambitions of Gino Bartali to equal the record number of victories by Alfredo Binda. Fausto Coppi was mobilized on the forehead, in Tunisia, and Bartali moved to Vatican alongside Pope Pius XII. [ http://www.sportvox.fr/article.php3?id_article%3D24691 Le Centenaire du Giro SportVox.fr 16 September 2010 ] After 5 years of waiting, the Giro resumed in 1946, on the roads that were devastated by war. The Coppi-Bartali Rivalry divided Italy: the first, known as Gino the Pious, was the favorite of the Christian Democrats while the latter, Coppi, was revered by the left and progressives. The epic duel saw the victory of Bartali with only 47 seconds ahead of his rival, Coppi. This edition of the Giro d&apos;Italia was also marked by clashes between activists in favor of the annexation of Trieste to Yugoslavia and Italian police disrupt the stages of the Giro. Fausto Coppi took his revenge, on Gino Bartali, the following year by winning the 1947 Giro d&apos;Italia. In 1948 Fausto Coppi was ahead of Gino Bartali in the Dolomites but withdrew from the Giro, along with his team after the 17th stage result. It was suspected by the team of Coppi, to have received improper assistance while on a mountain. Juries inflicted a two minute penalty. However, for Coppi and his team, it was not enough, outraged, they withdrew from the Giro d&apos;Italia leaving the victory to Fiorenzo Magni. Magni won the Giro by only 11 seconds over Ezio Cecchi, thus forming the smallest gap ever recorded in the Giro&apos;s history.

The feat accomplished by the Luxembourg during this stage is considered by some as one of the biggest in the history of cycling. Jacques Goddet wrote the following day: [ Charly Gaul won the victory more comprehensive than the cyclist has achieved in one day... It is a feat unprecedented in modern cycling. This echoes the character of the mountain stages of prehistoric times. He took it to the celestial cataclysm, but also the class very rare and very special... the small Luxembourg Jacques Goddet ] In 1957, French Louison Bobet missed becoming the first French to win the Giro d&apos;Italia.

This edition was marked by an anecdote that was fraught with consequences for Charly Gaul. Indeed, from the 18th stage, he was leading with 56 seconds ahead of Nencini and 1 minutes 17 seconds ahead of Louison Bobet. After 102  km of racing, Gaul stopped on the roadside to urinate; that moment Louison Bobet, Nencini, and Miguel Poblet attacked.

His first victory was a masterful one. The Badger took the overall lead at the end of three days and became the equal of Merckx, Gimondi, and Anquetil in winning all three grand tours. The mighty Breton would participate in two more tours of Italy (1982, 1985), each time emerging victorious, and each time making the Giro-Tour double.

[ Classifications ] Whereas the overall leader of the Tour de France is awarded a yellow jersey (originally to correspond with L&apos;Auto &apos;s yellow pages), since 1931 the leader of the general classification in the Giro sports the maglia rosa (pink jersey), which corresponds with newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport &apos;s pink newsprint. The leader of the mountains classification was designated by a green jersey, the maglia verde, from 1974 to 2011, but this changed to blue in 2012 as maglia azzurra. The leader of the points classification used to wear the maglia ciclamino (mauve jersey) but from 2010 wears the Maglia Rosso Passione (red jersey). The best young rider wears the maglia bianca (white jersey). { maglia rosa &apos;&apos; from the 88th edition of the race in 2005. } Italian Felice Gimondi holds the record for the most podium finishes: nine in total, consisting of three victories, two second places and four third place finishes. In the 1940s, there also was a black jersey, for the cyclist who was last in the general classification. [ General classification ] [ general classification in the Giro d&apos;Italia ] The maglia rosa, or pink jersey, is worn each day by the cyclist with the fastest overall time up to that point of the Giro. The rider wearing the jersey may change from day to day, but given the glory and extra exposure for the team, individual and sponsor of the rider who holds the jersey, teams often make extra efforts to keep the jersey on the race leader from day to day. In fact, each team brings several pink jerseys to the race in case one of their riders becomes the leader. The cyclist with the lowest time at the end of the Giro&apos;s last stage wins the Giro. This is similar to the Yellow jersey used in the Tour de France. 5 wins: Alfredo Binda (1925, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1933), Fausto Coppi (1940, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953), Eddy Merckx (1968, 1970, 1972, 1973, 1974) 3 wins: Giovanni Brunero (1921, 1922, 1926), Gino Bartali (1936, 1937, 1946), Fiorenzo Magni (1948, 1951, 1955), Felice Gimondi (1967, 1969, 1976), Bernard Hinault (1980, 1982, 1985) [ Mountains classification ] [ Mountains classification in the Giro d&apos;Italia ] During mountain stages of the race, points are awarded to the rider who is first to reach the top of each significant climb. Points are also awarded for riders who closely follow the leader up each climb. The number of points awarded varies according to the hill classification, which is determined by the steepness and length of that particular hill. The climbers&apos; jersey is worn by the rider who, at the start of each stage, has the largest amount of climbing points. If a rider leads two or more of the categories, the climbers&apos; jersey is worn by the rider in second, or third, place in that contest. At the end of the Giro, the rider holding the most climbing points wins the climbing competition. In fact, some riders, particularly those who are neither sprinters nor particularly good at time-trialing, may attempt only to win this particular competition within the race. This is a similar competition to the polka dot jersey award of the Tour de France, except that the Giro uses three categories for mountains while the Tour uses five. In the Giro, there are no Hors Catégorie or fourth-category ratings. Also, the Cima Coppi, the highest point reached in a particular Giro, is worth more points than the race&apos;s other first-category climbs.

The red jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage, has the largest amount of points. The rider whom at the end of the Giro, holds the most points, wins the points competition. This is a similar competition as the green jersey of the Tour de France, with one key difference. Whereas in the Tour de France flat stages award more points than climbing stages, in the Giro all stages award the same points on the same scale. The stage win awards 25 points, second place is worth 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for fifteenth. The 2011 winner was Michele Scarponi. In addition, stages can have one or more intermediate sprints: 6, 4, and 2 points are awarded to the first three cyclists passing these lines. These points also count toward the TV classification (Traguardo Volante, or &quot; flying sprint &quot; ), a separate award. 4 wins: Francesco Moser, Giuseppe Saronni 3 wins: Mario Cipollini, Roger De Vlaeminck, Johan Van der Velde [ Youth competition ] [ Young rider classification in the Giro d&apos;Italia ] The youth competition is a competition within the giro, celebrating young riders.

[ Where the Giro has started and ended ] For nearly half a century, the Giro started and finished by Milan, the city where the headquarters of the Gazzetta dello Sport were located. Though with occasional exceptions, this has been the rule until 1960 that year, the place of departure is changed each time. For some periods (1965, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1975, 1981–1989) and the place of arrival has changed, but the 1990 was added to restore the traditional Milan, with a circuit to be repeated several times that serves as the final parade. In 2009, to commemorate the centennial of the event, the arrival took place in Rome. The capital had already been the location of the final round of the 1911 and 1950. The 2010 edition ended in Verona, as happened in editions 1981 and 1984. The tour takes place mainly in Italy, but some stages have departure or conclusion locations in other countries, especially in neighbouring countries such as San Marino, France, Monaco, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. Some stages have been held in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany ( 2002 and 2006 ), and Greece ( 1996 ). The 2012 edition of the Giro started in Denmark, with stages in Herning (hometown of Bjarne Riis ) and Horsens.
