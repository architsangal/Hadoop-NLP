[ History ] Like many cities along the Missouri River, Sugar Creek shows evidence of having once been the home of the American Indian. History attributes the name &quot; Sugar Creek &quot; to Indian folklore and a creek lined with sugar maples that ran through the city. From the town&apos;s home page: In the early 1800s, the area that is now Sugar Creek served as an important link in America&apos;s westward expansion. Known at the time as Wayne City Landing, the territory along the Missouri River served as a port to receive supplies for early pioneers. On June 25, 1804, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped on an island { The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, University of Nebraska, Lincoln } in the Missouri River opposite what is modern day Sugar Creek. Wayne City, which is now on the national historic register, also received travelers who were headed west along the Oregon, California and Santa Fe trails. In 1850, the first railroad west of the Mississippi River was constructed to join Wayne City and nearby Independence. From the early 1890s to the 1930s, the Sugar Creek area was home to a first-class pleasure resort, Fairmount Park. Among the park&apos;s attractions were a hotel, theater, lake, and carnival rides, including a roller coaster that at one time was the world&apos;s largest. A streetcar line brought visitors to the park from nearby Kansas City. In 1903, Standard Oil of Indiana purchased land at the northern edge of the city. A new oil refinery was opened a year later and quickly spurred growth in the townsite of Sugar Creek. A number of immigrants from Eastern Europe came to work in the plant, and by 1918, the town had grown to more than 800 residents. Shortly after World War I, businessmen and residents founded the Sugar Creek Improvement Association. The Association installed streetlights, set city limits and petitioned for incorporation as a city. On November 15, 1920, the City of Sugar Creek was officially born. The new town consisted of [ 564 acre km2 ] and had a population of around 1,800 residents. The city continued to grow and prosper in its early years. In 1958, an additional [ 294 acre km2 ] were annexed on the eastern side of the city, bringing new opportunities for development. The Liberty Bend Bridge, in northeastern Sugar Creek, carries Route 291 across the Missouri River. The northbound bridge was built in 1949 when a new channel for the river was completed, and replaced the 1927 Liberty Bend Bridge which was about two miles to the north and crossed over the former river channel. Construction began in 1996 on the southbound bridge, which opened in 2001, and the northbound bridge was completely rehabilitated. It was part of an upgrade that changed Route 291 into a four-lane divided highway. In 2009, BP Oil N America, settled a multi-million dollar lawsuit for extreme polluting and causing unusual cancers in many people. { http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4185/is_20061020/ai_n16804348/ } In 2009, a large portion of the population was harassed by prank callers.
