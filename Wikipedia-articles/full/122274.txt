The population was 13,092 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Grenada County [ 6 ]. [ History ] [ October 2009 ] Grenada County was formed by an act of the Legislature on May 9, 1879 from lands taken from Carroll, Choctaw, Tallahatchie, and Yalobusha Counties. The city of Grenada, which was incorporated on February 27, 1836, was the largest town among the four counties which were pared to form Grenada County, and it was the natural choice to serve as the new county&apos;s seat of government. The land from which Grenada County was formed was a part of the Choctaw Indian lands ceded to the United States under the treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830. The earliest known white settlers there were missionaries who established an Indian mission school in 1815 near what later became the town of Elliott. The first town organized in the area was Chocchuma, where the land office for the sale of the Choctaw Indian lands was located. Although the public sale of the Choctaw lands did not start until 1833, two politicians and land speculators. Hiram Runnels and Franklin Plummer were able to purchase choice sites along the banks of the Yalobusha River from individuals who received the land directly under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. The two plots of land were later sold to other parties and eventually became the rival towns of Pittsburg and Tullahoma. Town lots went on sale in Pittsburg in October, 1833 and in Tullahoma in February, 1834. The two towns, which were separated only by a section line (now Line Street in Grenada), both prospered and became sharp rivals. In 1835, Tullahoma attempted to annex Pittsburg, and Pittsburg retaliated with an effort to annex Tullahoma. The governor refused both annexation requests.
