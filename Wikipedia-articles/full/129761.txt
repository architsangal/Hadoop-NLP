[ Leach Michael E. 2000 Laborers in the Vineyard, Precious Blood Ministry in Glandorf, Putnam County, Ohio The Hubbard Company. ] [ 3-6 ] They embarked on the ship Columbus on September 7, 1833 in Amsterdam, landed November 6, 1833 in New York, and purchased some land in Putnam County in December. [ Hunsche Friedrich E. Glandorf in Nordamerika. Aus der Geschichte der Gemeinde und einiger Tochtergemeinden Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung 11 April 1968 16 ] Members of this group were Johann F. Kahle, Wilhelm Gülker, Christian Strope, F. Wischmann, Friedrich Bredeick and Mathias and Friedrich Bockrath. Kahle bought land at Greensburg approximately 5 miles to the west of Glandorf and named it Maria Camp. Horstmann&apos;s land was named Glandorf. Their wives and ten other families from Glandorf followed in 1834. This was just the beginning of further emigration from Germany to Ohio and other states of the USA. After his death on February 21, 1843, Horstmann left his land to the community. In 1834 Horstmann built a log house to serve as church, school, and rectory. The new parish was placed under the patronage of St. John the Baptist. In 1835 the log house was replaced by a wooden church with a steeple, a bell and a pulpit from hallowed-out sycamore log. A brick church followed between 1846 and 1848. In 1878 the Neo-Gothic church St. John the Baptist was erected and consecrated on December 15. [ 15 ] In 1992 a fire started in the sacristy of the church and the sacristy and its contents were a complete loss. The entire interior has to be repainted. A convent of the German sisters&apos; order of the Society of the Precious Blood was founded in 1849. They cultivated the land which was originally owned by Horstmann and served as teachers. The convent was abandoned in 1917.
