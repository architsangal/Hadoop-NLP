[ http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/David_Ogden_Stiers/189878#full Hollywood Dot Com Biography ] [ M*A*S*H (1977–1983) ] In 1977, Stiers joined the cast of the now iconic CBS-TV sitcom M*A*S*H. As Major Charles Emerson Winchester III, Stiers filled the void created by the departure of actor Larry Linville &apos;s Frank Burns character. In contrast to the buffoonish Burns, Winchester was a well-spoken and talented surgeon who presented a different type of foil to Alan Alda &apos;s Hawkeye Pierce and Mike Farrell &apos;s B.J. Hunnicutt. Burns usually served as the butt of practical jokes instigated by Hawkeye or B.J., and his surgical skills were often harshly criticized. Charles, however, presented a challenge to his colleagues&apos; displays of irreverence because his surgical skills could match or even outshine theirs; his aristocratic manner and aversion to the puerile behavior served as the target for his fellow surgeons&apos; barbs and jokes. At times, however, Winchester could align himself with Hawkeye and B.J. and held considerable admiration for CO Col. Sherman T. Potter. For his portrayal of the pompous but nonetheless multidimensional Boston aristocrat, Stiers received two Emmy Award nominations. [ Other television work ] Following the completion of M*A*S*H, Stiers expanded his work on television with regular guest appearances on North and South; Star Trek: The Next Generation; Murder, She Wrote; Touched by an Angel; Wings; and Frasier, along with a recurring role in Season 1 of Two Guys and a Girl as Mr. Bauer.

He appeared in two unsuccessful television projects, Love &amp; Money and Justice League of America (as the Martian Manhunter ). In 2002, Stiers started a recurring role as the Reverend Purdy on the successful USA Network series The Dead Zone with Anthony Michael Hall. In 2006, he was cast as the recurring character Oberoth in Stargate Atlantis. Stiers also appeared in several Perry Mason made-for-TV movies in the 1980s as District Attorney Michael Reston. [ Film work ] Stiers&apos;s early films included Jack Nicholson’s Drive, He Said and the George Burns comedy Oh, God! He followed up with roles in Harry&apos;s War, Better Off Dead, The Man With One Red Shoe, The Accidental Tourist, Iron Will, Doc Hollywood, Jungle 2 Jungle, and Krippendorf&apos;s Tribe.
