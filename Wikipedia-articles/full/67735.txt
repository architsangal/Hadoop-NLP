It is run at Longchamp over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year, usually on the first Sunday in October. Popularly referred to as the &quot; Arc &quot;, it is the most prestigious horse race in Europe, and one of the most renowned international events in any sport. Many of its winners are subsequently regarded as champions, and its roll of honour features such highly acclaimed horses as Ribot, Sea Bird, Dancing Brave, Zarkava, Sea The Stars and Danedream. It is currently the world&apos;s third richest horse race on turf, after the Melbourne Cup and Japan Cup. A slogan of the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe, first used on a promotional poster in 2003, describes the event as &quot; Ce n&apos;est pas une course, c&apos;est un monument &quot; – &quot; Not so much a race as a monument &quot;. [ History ] [ Origins ] The former governing body of French racing, the Société d&apos;Encouragement, had initially restricted its races to thoroughbreds which were born and bred in France. In 1863, however, it launched a new event, the Grand Prix de Paris, which was designed to bring together the best three-year-olds from any country. Thirty years later it introduced a second international event, the Prix du Conseil Municipal, which enabled the leading horses of different age groups to compete against each other. This race was run over 2,400 metres in October, and its conditions included &quot; overweights and underweights &quot;, a handicap system based on the previous performances of the participating horses. The creation of a third such race was proposed by the Société d&apos;Encouragement at a committee meeting on 24 January 1920. The new event, like its predecessors, would take place at Longchamp. It was to be an international race to complement the Grand Prix de Paris, and it would serve as a showcase for French thoroughbred breeding. It would have similar characteristics to the Prix du Conseil Municipal, but unlike that event it would use the weight for age system, with each horse competing on equal terms, unpenalised for previous victories. Coming in the wake of World War I, it was decided that the race would be named after the Arc de Triomphe, a famous monument in Paris which had been the scene of a victory parade by the Allies in 1919. The title Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe had been previously assigned to a minor event at Longchamp. Another suggested title had been the Prix de la Victoire. [ Race history ] The Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe was first run on Sunday 3 October 1920. The inaugural running was won by Comrade, a three-year-old colt owned by Evremond de Saint-Alary. The winner&apos;s prize was 150,000 francs. The event secured state funding in 1935 by the means of a lottery, which awarded prizes according to the race result and the drawing of lots. The system was first used in 1936, and it continued until 1938. The &quot; Arc &quot; was cancelled twice during World War II, in 1939 and 1940. It was switched to Le Tremblay in 1943 and 1944, where it was run over 2,300 metres. It returned to Longchamp in 1945. Government funding of the race resumed in 1949, with money obtained through the Loterie Nationale. Offering an attractive jackpot of 50  million francs, this enabled a rapid increase of the prizes for both the &quot; Arc &quot; and its supporting races. By the 1970s, however, the assistance of the lottery had diminished, and the system was finally discontinued after the 1982 running. Since then the &quot; Arc &quot; has had several sponsors, including Trusthouse Forte, CIGA Hotels and Groupe Lucien Barrière. The present sponsor of the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe is the Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club (QREC). The sponsorship agreement between France Galop and the QREC was signed in Doha in 2008, and it covers the runnings of the &quot; Arc &quot; from 2008 to 2023. As a result of this deal the prize fund of the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe was doubled from €2  million to €4  million. It has thus become one of the world&apos;s richest horse races, which include the Dubai World Cup, the Japan Cup and the Melbourne Cup. The purse for the whole weekend of the &quot; Arc &quot; meeting now stands at €6.7  million (about US$ $10  million). It includes seven races classed at Group 1 level, and four with Group 2 status.Since 2008 the weekend is also home to Qatar Arabian World Cup (Gr1 PA) - the highest paid race for Purebred Arabian horses in the world.
