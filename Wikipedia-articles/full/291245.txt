The meaning of the term deep diving is a form of technical diving. [ Encyclopedia of Recreational Diving, 3rd edition Brylske A. 2006 PADI United States 1-878663-01-1 ] It is defined by the level of the diver&apos;s diver training, diving equipment, breathing gas, and surface support: [ 18 m ft -1 ] [ 30 m ft -1 ] [ 60 m ft ] [ 100 m ft ] in recreational diving, PADI define anything from to as a &quot; deep dive &quot; (other diving organisations vary) in technical diving, may be a &quot; deep dive &quot; in surface supplied diving, may be a &quot; deep dive &quot; This definition essentially relates to recreational diving. Deep diving may have quite a different meaning in the commercial diving field. For instance the early experiments carried out by Comex S.A. ( Compagnie maritime d&apos;expertises ) using hydrox and also nitrogen trimix attained far greater depths than any recreational technical diving. One example being the Comex Janus IV open-sea dive to [ 500 m ft ] in 1977. { Hydra 8: Pre-commercial Hydrogen Diving Project } The open-sea diving depth record was achieved in 1988 by a team of Comex divers who performed pipe line connection exercises at a depth of [ 534 m ft ] in the Mediterranean Sea as part of the Hydra 8 programme. { Comex S.A. HYDRA 8 and HYDRA 10 test projects } These divers needed to breathe special gas mixtures because they were exposed to very high ambient pressure (more than 50 times atmospheric pressure). An atmospheric diving suit allows very deep dives of up to [ 700 m ft ]. These suits are capable of withstanding the pressure at great depth permitting the diver to remain at normal atmospheric pressure. This eliminates the problems associated with breathing high pressure gases.

Fractionally deeper depths may apply in relation to freshwater due to its lower density Comments Recreational diving limit for divers aged under 12 years old and beginner divers. Recreational diving limit for divers with Open Water certification but without greater training and experience. Recommended recreational diving limit for divers. Average depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms begin to appear in adults. Absolute recreational diving limit for divers specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC). Maximum depth reachable by a French level 2 diver accompanied by an instructor (level 4 diver), breathing air. Technical diving limit for &quot; extended range &quot; dives breathing air to a maximum pp O 2 of 1.4 ATA. Maximum depth reachable by a French level 3 diver accompanied by another level 3 diver, breathing air. Depth at which compressed air results in an unacceptable risk of oxygen toxicity. Oxygen toxicity depends upon a combination of partial pressure and time of exposure, individual physiology, and other factors not fully understood. NOAA recommends that divers do not expose themselves to breathing oxygen at greater than 1.6 bar pp O 2, which occurs at breathing air. Technical diving training limit for divers breathing trimix. Recommended technical diving limit. Maurice Fargues was a volunteer in a programme to determine the maximum depth a scuba diver could reach with compressed air. He became the first diver to perish using scuba. Record depth for scuba dive on compressed air (not officially recognised). Set by Dr Dan Marion on March 18, 1994. The record is not officially recognised anywhere, and it should be noted that Dr Marion&apos;s second dive computer only registered a depth of 490 feet. See generally Deep Diving by Bret Gilliam, ISBN 0-922769-31-1, at pages 35 and following. Absolute limit for surface light penetration sufficient for plant growth, though minimal visibility possible farther down. Assuming crystal clear water; surface light may disappear completely at much shallower depths in murky conditions. Minimal visibility is still possible far deeper. Deep sea explorer William Beebe reported seeing blueness, not blackness, at 1400 feet (424 metres). &quot; I peered down and again I felt the old longing to go farther, although it looked like the black pit-mouth of hell itself---yet still showed blue. &quot; (William Beebe, &quot; A Round Trip to Davey Jones&apos;s Locker, &quot; The National Geographic Magazine, June 1931, p. 660.) World record for deepest dive on SCUBA. 1,083 feet was the depth reportedly achieved by Pascal Bernabé in 2005. However, the Guinness World Records still recognises the 1,044 feet dive by Nuno Gomes earlier in the same year as the current official world record. Navy diver in Atmospheric Diving System (ADS) suit. Navy diver sets world record [ Particular problems associated with deep dives ] Deep diving has more consequences and dangers than basic open water diving. [ Egstrom GH Historic Perspective: Scientific Deep Diving and the Management of the Risk In: Lang, MA and Smith, NE (eds). Proceedings of Advanced Scientific Diving Workshop Smithsonian Institution Washington, DC 2006 http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4653 2008-07-05 ] Nitrogen narcosis, the “narks” or “rapture of the deep”, starts with feelings of euphoria and over-confidence but then leads to numbness and memory impairment similar to alcohol intoxication. Decompression sickness, or the “bends”, can happen if a diver ascends too fast, when excess inert gas leaves solution in the blood and tissues and forms bubbles. These bubbles produce mechanical and biochemical effects that lead to the condition. The effects tend to be delayed until reaching the surface. Bone degeneration ( dysbaric osteonecrosis ) is caused by the bubbles forming inside the bones; most commonly the upper arm and the thighs. Air embolism causes loss of consciousness and speech and visual problems. This tends to be life threatening, and requires a recompression chamber for treatment. Deep diving involves a much greater danger of all of these, and presents the additional risk of oxygen toxicity, which may lead to a convulsion underwater. Very deep diving using a helium–oxygen mixture ( heliox ) carries a risk of high pressure nervous syndrome. Coping with the physical and physiological stresses of deep diving requires good physical conditioning. [ Southerland, DG Medical Fitness at 300 FSW In: Lang, MA and Smith, NE (eds). Proceedings of Advanced Scientific Diving Workshop Smithsonian Institution Washington, DC 2006 http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4659 2008-07-05 ] Using normal scuba equipment, breathing gas consumption is proportional to ambient pressure - so at [ 50 m ft ], where the pressure is 6 bar, a diver breathes 6 times as much as on the surface (1 bar). Heavy physical exertion causes even more gas to be breathed, and gas becomes denser requiring increased effort to breathe with depth, leading to increasing risk of hypercapnia, an excess of carbon dioxide in the blood. The need to do decompression stop s increases with depth. A diver at [ 6 m ft ] may be able to dive for many hours without needing to do decompression stops. At depths greater than [ 40 m ft ], a diver may have only a few minutes at the deepest part of the dive before decompression stops are needed. In the event of an emergency the diver cannot make an immediate ascent to the surface without risking decompression sickness. All of these considerations result in the amount of breathing gas required for deep diving being much greater than for shallow open water diving. The diver needs a disciplined approach to planning and conducting dives to minimise these additional risks.

Note the } { backplate and wing setup with } { sidemount ed } { stage tanks containing } { EAN50 (left side) and pure } { oxygen (right side). } Divers carry larger volumes of breathing gas to compensate for the increased gas consumption and decompression stops. Rebreather s manage gas much more efficiently than open circuit scuba, but are inherently more complex than open circuit scuba. Use of helium-based breathing gases such as trimix reduces nitrogen narcosis and stays below the limits of oxygen toxicity. A diving shot, a decompression trapeze or a decompression buoy can help divers return to their surface safety cover at the end of a dive.

Ultra-deep diving requires extraordinarily high levels of training, experience, fitness and surface support. Only eight (or possibly nine) persons are known to have ever dived below a depth of [ 800 ft m ] on self contained breathing apparatus recreationally.

It was a Turkish Navy experimental dive. } [ April 2009 ] That is fewer than the number of people who have walked on the surface of the moon. The Holy Grail of deep SCUBA diving was the [ 1000 ft m on ] mark, first achieved by John Bennett in 2001, and has only been achieved five times since. Dives of this nature have been impossible to verify - proof being as tangible as faith more often than not. Since the recent introduction of depth gauge s capable of reading to [ 330 m ft ] it is unlikely that such records will be attempted in the future. In 2003 Mark Ellyatt claimed dives to depths of [ 260 m ft ] and [ 313 m ft ]. [ Ultra deep air ] While extreme deep diving on air is extremely dangerous, before the popularity of Trimix attempts were made to set world record depths using conventional air. This created an extreme risk of both narcosis and oxygen toxicity in the divers and, perhaps unsurprisingly, contributed to an astonishingly high fatality rate amongst those attempting records. In his book, Deep Diving, Bret Gilliam chronicles the various fatal attempts to set records as well as the smaller number of successes.

Watson reported that he had no recollection at all of what transpired at the bottom of the descent due to narcosis. 1990 Bret Gilliam dived to a depth of on air. Unusually, Gilliam remained largely functional at depth and was able to complete basic maths problems and answer simple questions written on a slate by his crew beforehand. 1993 Bret Gilliam extended his own world record to, again reporting no ill effects from narcosis or oxygen toxicity. 1994 Dan Manion set the current record for a deep dive on air at. Manion reported he was almost completely incapacitated by narcosis and has no recollection of time at depth. In deference to the high death rate, the Guinness World Records ceased to publish records on deep air dives in mid 2005.
