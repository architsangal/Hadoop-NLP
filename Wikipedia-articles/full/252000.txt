Pease 2010-05-07 ] [ Volcanic gas discharge ] Mammoth is outgassing large amounts of carbon dioxide out of its south flank, near Horseshoe Lake. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the ground ranges from 20 to 90 percent CO 2. Measurements of the total discharge of carbon dioxide gas at the Horseshoe Lake tree kill area range from [ 50 to 150 ST MT 2 on ] per day. This high concentration causes trees to die in six regions that total about [ 170 acre km2 2 ] in size (see photo, below).

Another idea was that the kills were the result of a pathogen or other biological infestation. However neither idea explained why all trees in the affected areas were killed regardless of age or health. Then in March 1990, a United States Forest Service ranger became ill with suffocation symptoms after being in a snow-covered cabin near Horseshoe Lake.

Howle USGS Water-Resources Investigations report 98-4217 1999 ] Measurements around the lake found that restrooms and tent s had a greater than 1% CO 2 concentration (toxic), and a deadly 25% concentration of CO 2 in a small cabin. CO 2 concentrations of less than 1% are typical and healthy in most soil s, however soil concentrations of CO 2 in the tree kill areas ranged from 20% to 90%. This overabundance of CO 2 was found to be the cause of the tree kills because tree roots need to absorb O 2 directly and the high CO 2 level reduced available O 2. Researchers also determined that Mammoth releases about [ 1300 ST MT 2 ] of CO 2 every day. As of 2003 the concentration of carbon dioxide in soil gas at Mammoth Mountain is being monitored on a continuous, year-round basis at four sites - three at Horseshoe Lake and one near the base of Chair 19 at the ski area. Mammoth Mountain from the east The most likely sources of the CO 2 are degassing of intruded magma and gas release from limestone -rich metasedimentary rocks that are heated by magmatic intrusions. The remarkable uniformity in chemical and isotopic composition of the CO 2 and accompanying gases at different locations around Mammoth Mountain indicates that there may actually be a large reservoir of gas deep below the mountain from which gas escapes along fault s to the surface. Measurements of helium emissions support the theory that the gases emitted in the tree kill area have the same source as those discharged from Mammoth Mountain Fumarole.
