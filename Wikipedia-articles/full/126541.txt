The Village of Chaumont is in the western part of the Town of Lyme and is northwest of Watertown. [ History ] In 1750, Ray had bought the Chaumont castle (named from the Old French for &quot; bald hill &quot;, and built in two periods around 1500), in the Loire Valley of France. ( [ 2009 ], the village near it is called Chaumont-sur-Loire to distinguish it from the many other Chaumont s in France.) His support for the American Revolution suggested applying his name to the village in New York state. The first European-descended settlement of the village began in 1802, replacing an unsatisfactory site chosen the previous year. { History Of Lyme, NY (transcription with apparent [[Optical character recognition|OCR ] errors)], in Our County And Its People: A Descriptive Work On Jefferson County, New York, Edgar C.
