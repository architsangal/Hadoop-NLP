{ United States } { Rob Burnett (President/CEO) } { Peter Lassally } { Television and film } { production company } { David Letterman } { 70 (2007) } Worldwide Pants Incorporated is an American television and film production company owned by comedian and talk show host David Letterman. Its ongoing productions are Late Show with David Letterman (since 1993) and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (since 2005). It has produced the Late Show since 1993, and The Late Late Show since 1995. The company is headquartered at the Ed Sullivan Theater Building in New York City. The president and CEO is a former Late Show executive producer Rob Burnett. Peter Lassally (a former Tonight Show and Late Show executive producer) is the senior vice-president; he is also the current Late Late Show executive producer. [ Past television productions ] A predecessor company, Space Age Meats, produced Letterman&apos;s first television talk show, The David Letterman Show. The first Worldwide Pants production was Late Night with David Letterman, produced in partnership with NBC and Carson Productions. The company, then known as Worldwide Pants Productions, shared a 1991 Peabody Award, saying the three production companies managed to &quot; take one of TV&apos;s most conventional and least inventive forms — the talk show — and infuse it with freshness and imagination. &quot; { 1991 Peabody Award to &apos;&apos;Late Night with David Letterman&apos;&apos; from the } { Peabody Award website } Productions for CBS : The Late Show with David Letterman (1993 on) The Building (1993) The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder (1995–1999) The Bonnie Hunt Show (1995–1996) Welcome to New York (2000–2001) Everybody Loves Raymond (1996–2005, owned by HBO ) CBS The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn (1999–2004) The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (2005 on) Productions for NBC : Late Night with David Letterman (1991–1993), co-produced with Carson Productions Ed (2000–2004), (co-produced by Viacom Productions ) NBC Studios NBC Productions for ABC : The Knights of Prosperity (2007) Productions for PBS : Coming Home: Military Families Cope With Change in association with Sesame Workshop and Lookalike Productions (2009) Families Stand Together: Feeling Secure in Tough Times in association with Sesame Workshop and Lookalike Productions (2009) http://www.pbs.org/parents/familiesstandtogether/index.html Sesame Street: When Families Grieve in association with Sesame Workshop and Lookalike Productions (2010) http://www.sesameworkshop.org/grief Productions for HBO : The High Life (1996) [ 2007 WGA strike ] [ October 2008 ] Production of new episodes of the company&apos;s two late-night CBS talk shows ceased on November 5, 2007 when the Worldwide Pants writers joined the strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the trade association to which Worldwide Pants is a member. During the first part of the strike reruns of Worldwide Pants shows were aired. This changed when Worldwide Pants broke ranks with the AMPTP by negotiating an independent, interim collective bargaining agreement with the Writers Guild of America in which Worldwide Pants essentially agreed to operate in accordance with the contract demands of the WGA for the duration of the labor dispute. The agreements automatically reverted to the final contract terms that the guild reached with the AMPTP at the end of the strike. The agreement allowed both the Late Show with David Letterman and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson to return to the airwaves with their full writing staffs on January 2, 2008. The agreement gave Worldwide Pants and CBS a perceived advantage over their rivals at NBC. The latter network was unable to make similar arrangements for its late night programming because NBC has retained control of production operations for both The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O&apos;Brien. Unlike CBS, NBC would have had to negotiate an agreement covering the entire network in order to have writers work on the two late night shows. NBC aired new episodes of its late night shows on the same night as CBS, but without writers. This meant, among other things, that Leno and O&apos;Brien were unable to perform their traditional monologue s without violating strike rules (as the WGA had determined Leno did with monologues he claimed to write) and were unable to secure the appearance of many A-list celebrities, since most SAG celebrities refused to cross a picket line. The granting of complete control of Late Show to Letterman was originally a condition CBS accepted in exchange for Letterman&apos;s agreement to switch networks in 1993. [ Film production ] [ Strangers with Candy (film) ] The company produced its first film, Strangers with Candy, a prequel to the TV show of the same name. The film premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, within the &quot; Park City at Midnight &quot; category. Warner Independent Pictures subsequently signed up as North American distributor of the film, before ThinkFilm acquired the rights from Warner, giving it a limited release in summer 2006. The film grossed slightly more than $2 million, on $2 million production budget and $1.5 million prints and advertising budget. { Strangers with Candy from The Numbers } [ Other announced deals ] A 2002 Forbes article comments on the approach Letterman takes for Worldwide Pants television productions: { Celebrity 100 article about Letterman and Worldwide Pants, from a July 2002 &apos;&apos; } { Forbes article } Letterman&apos;s approach is to nurture an idea with seed money from his production company, then get someone else to pay for the rest of it. He isn&apos;t particularly hands-on once the programs get past the initial stages, but his imprimatur carries weight with network buyers. &quot; They&apos;ve got a point of view about everything they do, &quot; says Chris Albrecht, president of original programming at HBO. &quot; These guys are making television every night and have been for a long time. You feel more comfortable with them. &quot; In April 2005 the Sci Fi Channel announced that Worldwide Pants would produce a half-hour animated ensemble comedy for the channel from Brendon Small, called Barbarian Chronicles. A fall 2007 interview with Small posted on a hardcore/metal music review website made it clear that there are no plans to go through with the deal.
