[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 0756486 } [ 3 ] Osceola is a city in St. Clair County, Missouri, United States. The population was 947 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of St. Clair County [ 6 ]. [ History ] Located on the Osage River, the land that became the town of Osceola was inhabitied by the tribe of native Americans who gave the river its name. Two treaties, in 1808 and 1825, signed by the Osage and the U.S. government gave up all the tribes land in Missouri. With the way cleared for non-native settlers, more people began to arrive in the St. Clair County area in the mid-1830s. The first home was built in the future Osceola in the winter of 1835.

The event inspired the 1976 Clint Eastwood film The Outlaw Josey Wales. Prior to the attack the town had a population of around 2,500. However less than 200 residents remained after the event and the population has never again approached those numbers. In September, 2011 lingering bad feelings over the raid and the sesquicentennial of the event prompted the Osceola Board of Aldermen to pass a resolution asking the University of Kansas to no longer use &quot; Jayhawk &quot; as their mascot and nickname. Further, the resolution asks Missouri residents to stop spelling Kansas or KU with a capital letter because &quot; neither is a proper name or a proper place &quot;.
