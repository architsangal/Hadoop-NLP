It was too far from downtown Pittsburgh to be considered the &quot; suburb &quot; that it is today, although it was served solely by Pittsburgh based, state and federal services as well as Pittsburgh based media. In the early 1920s, John A. Bell of Carnegie purchased a number of small farms in Moon and established a major commercial dairy farm on his [ 1900 acre km2 0 ] of land. He was bought out by Mr. and Mrs. E.E. Rieck and C.F. Nettrour, owners of the established &quot; Rieck&apos;s &quot; Dairy, who doubled the number of cattle at the farm. By 1940 the United States was becoming involved in World War II. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) identified that the Pittsburgh area needed a military airport to defend the industrial wealth of the area and to provide a training base and stop-over facility. The agricultural expanses of Moon Township were attractive to the early airport planners in the city. The WPA bought the Bell Farm and began construction of the runways on April 20, 1942. In 1944 Allegheny County officials proposed to expand the military airport with the addition of a commercial passenger terminal in order to relieve the Allegheny County Airport, which was built in 1926 and whose capacity was quickly becoming insufficient to support the growing demand for air travel. Ground was broken on the new public passenger terminal on July 18, 1946. The new terminal building would eventually cost $33 million to build and was built exclusively by Pittsburgh-area companies. The new airport, christened as Greater Pittsburgh Airport (renamed Greater Pittsburgh International Airport in 1972 upon the opening of the International Arrivals Building) opened on May 31, 1952. The first flight occurred on June 3, 1952. In its full year of operation in 1953, over 1.4 million passengers used the terminal. At that time, &quot; Greater Pitt &quot; was considered &quot; modern &quot; and spacious. In fact the airport terminal was the largest in the United States, second only to Idlewild Airport&apos;s (now JFK Airport) in New York when it was completed five years later. The airport&apos;s capacity is one of its most valuable assets. &lt; center &gt; A replica of PIT&apos;s original terrazzo compass located in the new main terminal &lt; center &gt; The airport was designed by a local architect named Joseph W. Hoover. One of the primary features of his style is the use of simple, exposed concrete, steel, and glass materials. The terminal building was constructed in &quot; stepped &quot; levels: the first floor extended farther than the second, the second floor extended farther than the third, etc. Such a design meant that the uncovered roof of the lower level could then be used as an observation deck. In addition to the observation desks, the rounded &quot; Horizon Room &quot; was designed on the fourth floor with a commanding view of the airport runways. The interior of the terminal building was designed in the International Style, as was the exterior. One of the most memorable features of the lobby was the large compass laid in the floor with the green and yellow-orange terrazzo. The lobby also included shops and services for travelers. A mobile by Alexander Calder was another decorative feature of the lobby. The mobile currently hangs in the center core of the new airside terminal, and a re-creation of the compass was installed in the new terminal at an exhibit dedicated to old &quot; Greater Pitt. &quot; [ Growth of a Major Airport ] The first five airlines of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport were TWA, Capital Airlines (later part of United), Northwest, All American (later Allegheny Airlines, then USAir, and finally US Airways), and Eastern Airlines. The April 1957 Airline Guide shows 58 weekday departures on Capital, 54 TWA, 18 Allegheny, 8 United, 7 Eastern, 4 Northwest, 3 American and 2 Lake Central. Eastern had nonstops to Miami, but westward nonstops didn&apos;t reach beyond St Louis—though TWA had an overnight 1049G nonstop from Los Angeles ( &quot; Berths Available &quot; ). The 1956 airport diagram shows runway 10/28 7500  ft, 5/23 5766  ft and 14/32 5965  ft. The longest runway remained 7500  ft until a few years after jet service started in 1959. In 1959 the east dock was added to the terminal as air travel became more popular. On July 25, 1959, TWA introduced scheduled jet aircraft service ( Boeing 707 ) to Pittsburgh. With the longer range of jet engines, international air travel was more practical. By 1969, the airport sought to become an &quot; international &quot; airport. Ground was broken for the new International Wing, west of the original terminal building, on July 8, 1970. The International Wing opened in 1972 to accommodate federal inspection services and other requirements for international travel. Greater Pittsburgh Airport, circa 1977. From the 1960s to about 1985, Trans World Airlines operated a hub out of Pittsburgh. Destinations included major and secondary US Cities, London and Frankfurt. In 1972, rotunda s were added to the end of each dock to further expand the number of gates at the terminal. In the later 1970s, significant growth in regional air travel created a need for additional gates at the terminal. In 1980, the South East Dock was opened. Even with these large expansions, the terminal could not meet the needs of modern air travel. In 1987, with the financial backing of USAir (the most dominant carrier in Pittsburgh at the time), work commenced on a billion dollar expansion project at the airport. In 1985 the first Transatlantic flight service on a foreign airline came to Pittsburgh: British Airways started service using Boeing 747-200 aircraft. The initial route was Pittsburgh to London-Heathrow with a stop in Washington, D.C.. The stop point was later changed to Philadelphia. Later, British Airways moved the non-stop flight to London-Gatwick, with a change to London-Heathrow again with a stop in Montreal during the winter season. The airline ended service at the airport completely on October 31, 1999. In 2000, US Airways picked up the route to London-Gatwick but canceled it in 2004 due to extensive downsizing of the airport. On October 1, 1992 the new complex opened and all operations transfer red over from the old terminal overnight. The old terminal, demolished in 1999, remained standing to house remaining operations offices. The new terminal buildings were equipped with numerous innovative, state-of-the-art features at the time, including an AirMall with over 100 major name retailers and eateries (more defined in Passenger Complex section of this article). The new Landside/Airside design construction eliminated the need for connecting passengers to go through security again. The Airside Terminal at Pittsburgh International became a model for other airports around the world, specifically in designs that simplified aircraft movement on the airfield and enabled easy pedestrian traffic to the gates. [ Decline of US Airways ] End of Concourse A, sealed off (December 2011) By the late 1990s growth had leveled off, with USAir (later US Airways ) concentrating on expanding at Philadelphia and Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. In 1997, the airport handled almost 21 million passengers, the largest number of passengers served in one year since the airport&apos;s opening. { Pittsburgh International Airport Cargo and Passenger History, 1980–2003. Allegheny County Airport Authority. } Tough economic conditions for airlines at the start of the 21st century, the September 11 attacks, and high operating costs at the airport put the US Airways hub in Pittsburgh at a serious disadvantage. By 2003, US Airways reported to be running a $40 million loss per year operating its hub at Pittsburgh { &quot; Dismantling Pittsburgh: Death of an airline hub. &quot; Published October 15, 2007 by David Grossman.

By the end of the decade, the only US Airways operations that remained 68 flights per day, operating from ten gates on Concourse B, and one US Airways Club location. Numerous US Airways ticketing and customer service counters were abandoned, and 15 gates on Concourse A and B were sealed off from the rest of the airport.

The airport&apos;s operator, the Allegheny County Airport Authority, has attempted to attract new service to the airport, particularly low-cost and international carriers. AirTran Airways, which initially had trouble competing in Pittsburgh after beginning service in 2000, was finally able to successfully expand Pittsburgh offerings after the US Airways&apos; cuts. In 2003, USA3000 Airlines began service to Florida and subsequently expanded to include international destinations in the Caribbean. Southwest Airlines began service to Pittsburgh in May 2005 and broke US Airways&apos;s monopolies on Tampa, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Philadelphia, along with bringing more competition to the Chicago and Orlando markets. JetBlue Airways began service on June 30, 2006 with flights to Boston-Logan and New York-Kennedy, thus in turn breaking US Airways&apos; monopoly on Boston and added more competition to the New York market. Myrtle Beach Direct Air began service in March 2007 and broke US Airways&apos;s monopoly on Myrtle Beach. Combined increases in competition and diversification of carriers at the airport led to a decline in average airfares by roughly 30%, lowering notoriously high fares once commonplace for the airport. [ Airport Property Development ] Aside from commercial flights, other resources in and around the airport have been developed in recent years. In November 2008, the airport, helped by the volunteer ambassadors, opened a new Military Comfort Center at Gate A4 to serve traveling military and their families.
