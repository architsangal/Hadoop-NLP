[ suprematism ] Supremacism is the belief that a particular race, species, ethnic group, religion, gender, sexual orientation, class, belief system or culture is superior to others and entitles those who identify with it to dominate, control or rule those who do not. [ Sexual ] Many anthropologists consider male supremacism, also known as “male dominance” or “ patriarchy ”, to exist in all cultures throughout human history. Under it special rights or status is granted to men, i.e. &quot; male privilege. &quot; Such supremacy is enforced through a variety of cultural, political and interpersonal strategies. { Peggy Reeves Sanday, Female power and male dominance: on the origins of sexual inequality, Cambridge University Press, 1981, p. 6-8, 113-114, 174, 182. ISBN 0-521-28075-3, ISBN 978-0-521-28075-4 } Others note that this often has been balanced by various forms of female authority. { Peggy Reeves Sanday, p. 113. } Since the 19th century there have been a number of feminist movements opposed to male supremacism and working for equal legal rights and protections for women in all cultural, political and interpersonal relations.
