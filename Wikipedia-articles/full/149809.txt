This is where Tankian first began to play instruments and write songs. [ Soil and System of a Down (1994–2006) ] [ System of a Down ] The early beginnings of System of a Down lie in a band named Soil (not to be confused with the Chicago-based band SOiL ) with Tankian on vocals &amp; keyboards, Daron Malakian on vocals &amp; lead guitar, Dave Hakopyan on bass and Domingo Loranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian as their then-manager but for him to later join as rhythm guitarist. Loriano and Hakopyan later left the band feeling that it wasn&apos;t going anywhere, leading to Soil splitting up. After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian and Malakian formed a new band they called System of a Down, after a poem Malakian wrote called Victims of a Down. Their original drummer was Ontronik Khachaturian, with whom they had spent time playing with in Soil, though he was later replaced by John Dolmayan after breaking his hand shortly before a gig the band had been booked to play, giving Dolmayan the last-minute call up. The band quickly began touring the Southern California rock clubs, and began to attract a strong following. [ Elect the Dead (2007–2010) ] Tankian&apos;s breakthrough as a solo artist came with the release of his debut record Elect the Dead. The first singles from Elect the Dead are &quot; The Unthinking Majority &quot; and &quot; Empty Walls &quot;. The music video &quot; Feed Us &quot; was released on the Swedish { Swedish MTV } and UK { UK MTV } MTV. Tankian appeared on MTV &apos;s You Rock The Deuce to promote Elect the Dead. [ August 2009 ] A music video was directed and filmed for every song on the record, each by unique directors. Tankian explained, &quot; I asked each of the directors for their visual interpretation of my work. They were asked not to write treatments and that they could make whatever they liked. The results have been overwhelmingly amazing! &quot; { System of a Down Frontman To Post Videos For Each Track On Forthcoming Solo Album } Some music videos were initially released exclusively to those who purchased the limited edition of Elect the Dead, while all of the music videos, except &quot; Money &quot;, have since been publicly released on Tankian&apos;s website and YouTube channel. Some videos have alternative versions which were originally released as well, but later altered. [ August 2009 ] Three different promo versions of the album have surfaced to the public. The instrumental promotional version, issued by Serjical Strike/Reprise Records and intended for the music and movie industry, contains instrumental versions of the twelve album tracks. Another promotional version, issued by Reprise Records and made only for individual reviewers, features the album in final master form. This promotional CD-R, which was labeled &quot; Smart Talk &quot; as a codename for &quot; Serj Tankian &quot; to prevent leaking by unauthorized persons, also indicates that the album was finalized prior to [ 2007 08 20 ]. { Picture of the Elect The Dead promo CD-R } Before this a similar but undated promo, also under the name &apos;Smart Talk&apos;, was issued featuring the final versions of the songs, albeit not yet mastered.

Although it is originally a song restricted to piano and vocals, Tankian used his backing band, the Flying Cunts of Chaos (F.C.C.), to provide guitars, drums, and bass. [ August 2009 ] The songs &quot; Beethoven&apos;s Cunt &quot;, Empty Walls, and Sky Is Over are available as downloadable content for Rock Band.

[ Imperfect Harmonies (2010–2012) ] Tankian&apos;s second solo album was originally due in 2009. It is said to be more of a jazz and orchestral based sound. Said Tankian of the second album, &quot; I&apos;m structuring the next record kind of like a jazz orchestral. I&apos;ve got a full orchestra interested, so I want this giant electric guitar in the air to be played by a full orchestra. I want the orchestra to be the electric guitar. I want to make an orchestra do what it&apos;s never done before, like a GG Allin type orchestra.

On August 22, 2010, a music video for Left Of Center was released on Tankian&apos;s MySpace account. The premiere date for Tankian and Sater&apos;s Prometheus Bound at the American Repertory Theater is February 25, 2011. The singer has said that collaborating on the show has been a great learning experience for him. &quot; I’ve been using a lot of my archives, a lot of different types of music that I had already put together for underscoring and what not, &quot; he said. &quot; It’s quite diverse, from noise to jazz to electronic stuff to hip-hop songs to rock songs to cool, piano dark underscores, and that’s a whole different bag of tricks there because it’s always evolving. Unlike a film score that’s very linear and you get a scene to score for, this is something where you do another workshop and one song is gone, that underscore changes to 20 seconds and they need something else on the spot. Everything’s always changing until the show comes, so it’s quite interesting. &quot; [ http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2010/10/07/serj-tankian-discusses-orchestral-work-a-r-t-musical-armenian-show/ Serj Tankian Discusses New Directions, A.R.T.
