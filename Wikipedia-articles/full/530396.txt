It is currently used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection of organ transplant s and treatment of renal cell cancer. Much research has also been conducted on everolimus and other mTOR inhibitors for use in a number of cancers. It is marketed by Novartis under the tradenames Zortress (USA) and Certican (Europe and other countries) in transplantation medicine, and Afinitor in oncology. [ Approvals and indications ] Everolimus is approved for various conditions: [ Afinitor approved in US as first treatment for patients with advanced kidney cancer after failure of either sunitinib or sorafenib Novartis 2009-03-30 http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2009/1301801.shtml April 6, 2009 ] [ Novartis receives US FDA approval for Zortress (everolimus) to prevent organ rejection in adult kidney transplant recipients Novartis 2010-04-22 http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2010/1406625.shtml April 26, 2010 ] [ http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/novartis-afinitor-cleared-by-fda-for-treating-sega-tumors-in-tuberous-sclerosis/81244159/ Novartis’ Afinitor Cleared by FDA for Treating SEGA Tumors in Tuberous Sclerosis 1 Nov 2010 ] Advanced kidney cancer (approved in March 2009) Prevention of organ rejection after renal transplant(April 2010) Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) in patients who are not suitable for surgical intervention (October 2010) Progressive or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors not surgically removable (May 2011) http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm254350.htm [ Clinical trials ] [ 2010 10 ], Phase III trials are under way in breast cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphoma. { http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/novartis-afinitor-cleared-by-fda-for-treating-sega-tumors-in-tuberous-sclerosis/81244159/ } The use of everolimus in refractory chronic Graft-versus-host disease has been reported in 2012.

This can lead to a hyper-activation of the kinase AKT via inhibition on the mTORC1 negative feedback loop while not inhibiting the mTORC2 positive feedback to AKT. This AKT elevation can lead to longer survival in some cell types.? [ Role in heart transplantation ] Everolimus may have a role in heart transplantation as it has been shown to reduce chronic allograft vasculopathy in such transplants. It also may have a similar role to sirolimus in kidney and other transplants. [ Eisen HJ, Tuzcu EM, Dorent R, et al. Everolimus for the prevention of allograft rejection and vasculopathy in cardiac-transplant recipients N. Engl. J. Med. 349 9 847–58 2003 August 12944570 10.1056/NEJMoa022171 http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dshort%26amp%3Bpmid%3D12944570%26amp%3Bpromo%3DONFLNS19 ] Because hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported, monitoring of blood lipid level is recommended. [ Use in vascular stents ] Everolimus is used in drug-eluting coronary stents as an immunosuppressant to prevent restenosis. Abbott Vascular produces an everolimus-eluting stent called the Xience V. It utilizes the Multi-Link Vision cobalt chromium stent platform and Novartis&apos; everolimus. The product is also currently in use in the United States and as an investigational device in Japan. It is also available under a private-label version called the PROMUS Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System and it is currently available in most major European and Asia-Pacific markets.
