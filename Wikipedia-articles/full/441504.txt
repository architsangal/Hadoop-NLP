[ no longer in existence US carrier (which merged with Cingular) BellSouth Mobility ] [ Bell Mobility Inc. 120px Subsidiary Bell Canada Toronto, Ontario ( 1986 ) Mississauga, Ontario George Cope - President Wireless Services BlackBerries, Apple iPhone, PocketPC, Palm, Wireless Data Services, Two way messaging, Picture and Video Messaging ( MMS ), Video Calling www.bell.ca/ ] { Mississauga, Ontario - &quot; Creekbank Campus &quot; } Bell Mobility is a CDMA and HSPA+ based wireless network (named Bell Cellular until 1993) and the division of Bell Canada which sells wireless services in Canada. In July 2006, Bell Mobility assumed responsibility for the former Aliant wireless operations in Atlantic Canada as part of a larger restructuring of both Bell and Aliant, and continued to do business there as Aliant Mobility until re-branding as Bell in April 2008. { BCE and Aliant form one of North America&apos;s largest regional telecommunications service providers } Bell Mobility and its affiliates combined have over 7 million subscribers as of the end of Q2 2011, including over 5.7 million or 79% on postpaid and over 1.5 million or 20% on prepaid. { Subscribers in Q2 2011 } Bell-owned Virgin Mobile Canada and Solo Mobile, as well as Loblaw &apos;s PC Mobile, operate as MVNO s on the Bell Mobility network. Some of Bell Canada&apos;s regional subsidiaries continue to operate their own wireless networks separate from (but generally allowing for roaming with) Bell Mobility; these are Northwestel (NMI Mobility and Latitude Wireless), Télébec (Télébec Mobilité), and NorthernTel (NorthernTel Mobility). Bell Mobility is a member of the British Columbia Technology Industry Association. [ Networks ] Although both are different and independent from one another, both the CDMA and HSPA+ networks use the 850 and 1900 MHz frequencies. Bell&apos;s LTE network uses Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) and other frequencies. [ Legacy ] Previously, Bell operated an Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) analog network, but it was decommissioned in February 2008. [ CDMA ] Bell Mobility maintains a legacy CDMA network with Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO) technology. The operator continues to provide roaming to other CDMA carriers such as Public Mobile and Telus Mobility in Canada. Bell also provides roaming for Sprint Nextel, a CDMA carrier in the United States, following a renewed agreement effective June 21, 2006. { Sprint newsroom } As of January 2012, none of Bell Mobility&apos;s current line up of phones use CDMA. [ HSPA+ ] In October 2009 Telus Mobility and Bell announced plans to deploy HSPA technology by 2010 as part of an effort to eventually upgrade to LTE technology. The network launched on November 4, 2009, months ahead of schedule. This allowed Bell to carry the iPhone 3GS, which was available at Telus the following day. Huawei and Nokia Siemens Networks provided the infrastructure for the new network, which covers 93% of the Canadian Population. { http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS211718+04-Nov-2009+BW20091104 } According to Bell, the single-channel HSPA+ network is available to 96% of the Canadian population. It provides download speeds of up to 21 Mbit/s, with typical speeds ranging between 3½ and 8 Mbit/s. The dual-channel network, on the other hand, is available to 70% of the Canadian population. It can reach download speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s but with typical speeds of 7 to 14 Mbit/s. [ LTE ] Bell launched LTE in Toronto and surrounding areas on September 14, 2011. On October 29, 2011, Bell expanded its LTE coverage to include the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth in Nova Scotia and Belleville in Ontario. { Google search. } This makes Bell the first LTE operator in all these regions. Theoretical maximum speeds for the current network are 75 Mbit/s for download, but the company claims that this will double over time. Typical speeds range from 12 Mbit/s to 25 Mbit/s. Two LTE mobile broadband modem s and an LTE smartphone are currently available. Service plans are currently priced identically to Rogers Wireless, but unlike Rogers, Bell does not charge a Government Regulatory Recovery Fee. Any plan that works with HSPA+ will also work with the LTE network at no additional charge. [ Products ] Bell Mobility LTE USIM [ Feature phones ] Bell Mobility sells the Samsung C414 and Samsung Rugby II HSPA+ feature phone s. The Sanyo Pro-700 is Bell&apos;s last feature phone to use the CDMA technology. [ Smartphones ] Various Android HSPA+ smartphones manufactured by LG and Samsung are sold via Bell Mobility. The BlackBerry Bold and BlackBerry Curve smartphones, manufactured by Research In Motion, are also part of Bell&apos;s lineup. The Curve 9380 and the BlackBerry Torch 9810 were previously sold, but are now discontinued. Bell is the second Canadian mobile carrier (after Rogers Wireless ) to carry the Apple iPhone on November 4, 2009. This is the same day that Bell&apos;s HSPA+ mobile network was launched. More than two years later, the iPhone 3GS is still sold by Bell alongside the newer iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models. Previously available smartphone platforms were Symbian from Nokia, webOS from HP and Windows Phone from Microsoft. [ Superphones ] Select high-end Android smartphones sold by Bell Mobility have been marketed as &quot; superphone s &quot; by the operator. The first of these was the Motorola Atrix 4G, but following a clearance sale of this device, it is no longer sold by the carrier since February 2012. Current superphones include: Google Galaxy Nexus HTC One S HTC Raider 4G LG Optimus LTE Samsung Galaxy Note Samsung Galaxy S II Samsung Galaxy S II HD LTE The Samsung Galaxy S III will soon be available at Bell Mobility. [ Rugged devices ] Similarly to but to a much lesser extent than its competitor Mike, Bell features a line-up of CDMA rugged feature phones and mobile broadband modem s built to withstand various weather conditions. { Business On The Go } Despite the growing popularity of Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and instant messaging on smartphones, Bell seems to be preparing for the launch of a new push-to-talk technology along with new HSPA+ devices. The Sonim XP5520 Bolt is scheduled to be launched on April 10, 2012, while Bell plans to release the Samsung Galaxy Rugby on the following day. [ http://mobilesyrup.com/2012/03/06/bell-to-release-the-samsung-galaxy-rugby-and-sonim-xp5520-bolt/ Bell to release the Samsung Galaxy Rugby and Sonic XP5520 Bolt Hardy Ian Mobile Syrup 2012-03-10 ] [ Legacy products ] Bell carried the Palm Pre smartphone on August 27, 2009. They were the exclusive carrier in Canada for this CDMA device, and marketed it heavily to compete against the iPhone, which was then exclusive to Rogers Wireless and its brand Fido. When Bell launched its HSPA network and the iPhone 3GS on November 4, 2009, the promotion and popularity of the Pre decreased. On August 17, 2011, nearly two years after its initial launch, the Palm Pre was officially discontinued by Bell. It was the last CDMA smartphone released by Bell. An icon depicting the Palm Pre continues to appear of the Mobility tab Bell&apos;s website. Due to the age of the technology as deployed by Bell, CDMA smartphones are no longer sold by Bell Mobility, although its brand Solo Mobile continued to sell the BlackBerry Pearl 8130 for a few months after Bell&apos;s Palm Pre was discontinued. The BlackBerry Pearl 8130 at Solo was no longer sold by late 2011. [ Services ] BlackBerry Internet Service Telephony SMS and MMS Bell offers a service to check account balances, minutes and megabytes of mobile data used, add features and answers to frequently asked questions. The service is called TCARE, short for text message care. It is used by sending a blank message to the phone number TCARE (82273). [ Mobile Internet ] Bell offers four Internet-only plans and several smartphone plans and add-ons for customers wishing to access mobile broadband. Only one plan can be added per device, and certain plans are only available for certain devices. Various fixed data allowances are offered by Bell: 10, 20, 100, 300 and 500 MB, as well as 1 to 6 GB, 10 GB and 15 GB. The 20 MB add-on is a daily allowance, while the others are monthly allowances. Flexible data plans are also available. This is used for Bell Mobility&apos;s Internet-only plans and some smartphone plans, which begins with a certain usage limit at a lower tier. If this is exceeded, the customer moves to the next higher tier with a slightly larger allowance. The flexible &quot; Turbo Hub &quot; plans from Bell differs in that customers have to pay a premium if they want additional speed for the same amount of usage. Usage allowances are 3 GB, 5 GB, 10 GB and 15 GB. Voice service can be added on supported devices, but Bell no longer sells these. Rogers Wireless has similar pricing for its &quot; Rocket Hub &quot; plans. Some grandfathered customers have an unlimited mobile Internet plan or add-on. These are usually limited to older and slower CDMA devices such as the now-discontinued Palm Pre, and normally cannot be used for tethering unless the device is a mobile broadband modem. Bell&apos;s discontinued brand Solo Mobile (soon to cease new activations) and its active Virgin Mobile Canada brand also have grandfathered accounts with unlimited mobile broadband. Occasionally, Bell releases a 6 GB data allowance for smartphones at the reduced cost of $30/month. This cannot be purchased alone, as it must be added to a voice plan. [ Mobile TV and Radio ] [ Bell Mobile TV ] Bell Mobile TV was launched for Bell smartphone s on October 18, 2010. { Bell launches 3 Mobile TV theme packages: Sports, Variety and HBO - Mobile Syrup } [ Push-To-Talk ] On April 24, 2012, Bell launched an improved Push-To-Talk (PTT) service. It is powered by Bell&apos;s newer HSPA+ network, contrary to the operator&apos;s older PTT service which used the CDMA network. HSPA+ service is available at one flat rate for unlimited Bell-to-Bell PTT service from and to Canada. The monthly service can either be purchased alone, or added to any plan at a lower cost. PTT roaming in the United States or other international countries is billed per megabyte. One megabyte offers approximately ten minutes of PTT talk time. Consequently, Bell offers approximately 100 to 400 PTT roaming minutes for traveling in the USA. [ Discontinued services ] Bell launched a proprietary Video Calling service on November 4, 2009 for select HSPA+ mobile phones. The service featured a cost of $5 CAD per month for unlimited video calls. { http://www.bell.ca/support/PrsCSrvWls_Ftrs_VideoCalling.page#0 source } It was supported by the LG Xenon, Nokia C6, Nokia N97, Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant, Samsung Omnia II and Samsung Wave smartphones. These devices have all been discontinued. It is unknown whether or not a non-Bell Galaxy S, or even Bell&apos;s Samsung Galaxy S II, support the Video Calling service. These Android -based devices, however, can use the included Google Talk for videoconferencing as long as they have an Internet connection available. Bell&apos;s cellular service does not currently offer unlimited mobile broadband. [ Advertising ] From 2003 to 2005 and in 2007, Bell Mobility and its brand Solo Mobile used a pixel art style of advertising. This reflected the limited capacity of graphical displays in mobile phones sold throughout these years. In conjunction with the 2006 Olympics, Bell Mobility introduced a pair of anthropomorphic CGI beaver s named Frank (voiced by Norm Macdonald ) and Gordon (voiced by Ken Hudson Campbell ), { http://blogs.voices.com/voxdaily/2006/02/frank_and_gordon.html source } who constantly got into misadventures which led to Frank getting flustered with the antics of the dimwitted Gordon. Analysts covering a potential restructuring of BCE suggested getting rid of the Frank and Gordon ad campaign. They have also criticized some of Bell Mobility&apos;s initiatives as failing to tap the market, such as offering full-length movies. { Movies } The ad campaign was canceled by Bell on August 1, 2008 { Bell&apos;s beavers bite it } and replaced with the &quot; Today just got better &quot; campaign. [ Criticism ] [ Criticism of Bell Canada#Mobility ] Bell Mobility and its brands have been the subject of numerous criticism. [ Retail presence ] In addition to running its own retail operations, Bell partners with multi-carrier retailers like those run by throughout Canada by Glentel.
