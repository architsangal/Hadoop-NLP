Hansell 345 ] Four years later, the state constitution changed the school&apos;s name to the Louisiana Industrial Institute. In 1921, the college changed its name to the Louisiana Polytechnic Institute to reflect its evolution from a trade school to a larger and more capable technical institute. Under the leadership of Dr. F. Jay Taylor, the college continued to grow and change over time. The Louisiana Polytechnic Institute became desegregated in the 1960s, and officially changed its name to Louisiana Tech University in 1970. Louisiana Tech enrolled 11,581 students in five academic colleges during the Fall 2011 academic quarter including 2,444 students in the graduate school. In addition to the main campus in Ruston, Louisiana Tech holds classes at the Technology Transfer Center in Shreveport, operates a satellite campus at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, and maintains an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Detachment 305. { http://www.latech.edu/tech/afrotc/ } Louisiana Tech fields 16 varsity NCAA Division I sports teams (7 men&apos;s, 9 women&apos;s teams) and has been a member of the Western Athletic Conference since 2001. The university has accepted an invitation to join Conference USA starting in 2013. The university is known for its football team and Lady Techsters women&apos;s basketball program which won three national championship titles (1981, 1982, 1988) and made 13 Final Four appearances in the program&apos;s history. [ History ] [ History of Louisiana Tech University ] The Centennial Plaza Clock Tower [ Early years ] On May 14, 1894, the Lincoln Parish Police Jury held a special session to outline plans to secure an Industrial School for Lincoln Parish. The police jury called upon State Representative George M. Lomax to introduce the proposed legislation during the upcoming session. Representative Lomax, Jackson Parish Representative J. T. M. Hancock, and lawyer and future judge John B. Holstead fought for the passage of the bill. On July 6, 1894, the proposed bill was approved as Act Number 68 of the General Assembly of Louisiana. The act established &quot; The Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana &quot;, an industrial institute created for the education of white children in the arts and sciences. In 1894, Colonel Arthur T. Prescott was elected as the first president of the college. Colonel Prescott moved to Ruston and began overseeing the construction of a two-story main building. The brick building housed eight large classrooms, an auditorium, a chemical laboratory, and two offices. A frame building was also built nearby and was used for the instruction of mechanics. The Main Building was located on a plot of [ 20 acre m2 ] that was donated to the school by Francis P. Stubbs. On September 23, 1895, the school started its first session with six faculty members and 202 students. In May 1897, Harry Howard became the first graduate. Colonel Prescott awarded him with a Bachelor of Industry degree, but there was no formal commencement. The first formal commencement was held in the Ruston Opera House the following May with 10 graduates receiving their diplomas. Article 256 of the 1898 state constitution changed the school&apos;s name to Louisiana Industrial Institute.

Hearsey, convention printer 100 ] Two years later, the course of study was reorganized into two years of preparatory work and three years of college level courses. Students who were high school graduates were admitted to the seventh quarter (college level) of study without examination. As years went by, courses changed and admissions requirements tightened. From 1917-1925, several curricula were organized according to the junior college standards and were offered as Bachelors of Industry. In 1919, the Board of Trustees enlarged the curricula and started granting a standard baccalaureate degree. The first of these was granted on June 15, 1921, a Bachelor of Science in Engineering. The Constitution adopted June 18, 1921, changed the name of the school in Article XII, Section 9, from Louisiana Industrial Institute to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute.

During his twenty-five years at president, Dr. Taylor oversaw the transformation of the former Louisiana Polytechnic Institute into Louisiana Tech University. The university&apos;s enrollment grew from about 3,000 students in 1962 to roughly 12,000 students in 1987. { Charles and } { Sam Wyly } Most of the modern buildings on the Main Campus were either built or renovated during Taylor&apos;s tenure as university president. The main athletic facilities were constructed during the Taylor Era including Joe Aillet Stadium, the Thomas Assembly Center, J.C. Love Field, and the Lady Techster Softball Complex. In addition to the athletic facilities, the 16-story Wyly Tower, Student Bookstore, Nethken Hall ( Electrical Engineering building), the University President&apos;s House, and the current College of Business Building were built on the Main Campus. In order to house the increasing student body of Louisiana Tech, Dr. Taylor led the construction of Graham, Harper, Kidd, Caruthers, and Neilson Residence Halls. Taylor&apos;s time as Louisiana Tech president also marked the beginning of Lady Techster athletics. In 1974, Taylor established the Lady Techsters women&apos;s basketball program with a $5,000 appropriation. He hired Sonja Hogg, a 28-year old PE instructor at Ruston High School, as the Lady Techsters&apos; first head coach. Under Coach Hogg and her successor Leon Barmore, the Lady Techsters won three National Championships during the 1980s.

[ Traditions ] [ Traditions of Louisiana Tech University ] [ Lady of the Mist ] Lady of the Mist The Lady of the Mist is one of the most recognizable landmarks on the Louisiana Tech Main Campus. The granite sculpture sits in the midst of a fountain in the middle of the quadrangle (The Quad), one of the focal points of the university and part of the older section of the Main Campus. The Lady of the Mist symbolizes &quot; Alma Mater &quot; who welcomes new students and bids farewell to Tech graduates. The statue also symbolizes the hope that Louisiana Tech graduates will fulfill their ambitions and highest callings in life. The statue and fountain was funded in 1938 by the Women&apos;s Panhellenic Association of Ruston, the governing body of the university&apos;s sorority groups. The Lady of the Mist was the idea of Art &amp; Architecture faculty member Mary Moffett and Art Department Chair Elizabeth Bethea. { http://www.latech.edu/specialcollections/collections/m203.shtml } The Lady of the Mist was created by Duncan Ferguson and Jules Struppeck and specifically located in the middle of the Quad facing north toward the old North entrance columns of the Tech campus. This was done to welcome everyone to the campus as people looked through the North entrance columns to see the statue&apos;s open arms waiting to greet them. The Lady fell into disrepair in the years after its construction. In 1985, the statue was restored through the efforts of the Student Government Association, Panhellenic, the Residence Hall Association, and the Association of Women Students. Today, the statue remains a focal point of students and alumni who return to the Tech campus. { The Lady of the Mist } [ First-Year Experience Academic Convocation ] The Lady of the Mist has played an integral part in Louisiana Tech&apos;s First-Year Experience Academic Convocation since the first ceremony was held in 2007. Every September during Welcome Week, the ceremony marks the first time the members of the incoming freshmen class come together and the last time they will officially gather together until their graduation. During the Academic Convocation, the freshmen students are introduced to President Daniel D. Reneau, university administrators, and distinguished alumni. { 2009 First-Year Experience Academic Convocation } Before the convocation ceremony begins, each freshmen student receives a medallion and is expected to hold onto the medallion until the ending of the ceremony where they walk from Howard Auditorium along a candlelit, alumni-lined path to the Lady of the Mist. When the freshmen students reach the Lady of the Mist, they deposit the medallions into the fountain as a symbol of their own investment in themselves and Louisiana Tech. { Tech Talk article (May 12, 2011) } Upon graduation from Louisiana Tech, the student will receive the medallion during the commencement ceremony. Each medallion has a picture of the Lady of the Mist on the front and the Tenets of Tech on the back. [ Alumni brick walkway ] The Brick Alumni Walkway The alumni walkway was constructed in 1995 as part of the centennial celebrations at Louisiana Tech. The brick path stretches from the corner of Adams Blvd &amp; Arizona Avenue through the heart of Centennial Plaza and ends at the footsteps of Tolliver Hall near Wisteria Street. As of May 2011, the walkway contains 72,000 engraved bricks representing all Louisiana Tech graduates up to the year 2000.
