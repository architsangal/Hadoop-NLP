In mathematics, a spline is a sufficiently smooth polynomial function that is piecewise -defined, and possesses a high degree of smoothness at the places where the polynomial pieces connect (which are known as knots).

In computer graphics splines are popular curves because of the simplicity of their construction, their ease and accuracy of evaluation, and their capacity to approximate complex shapes through curve fitting and interactive curve design. The most commonly used splines are cubic spline, i.e., of order 3—in particular, cubic B-spline and cubic Bézier spline. They are common, in particular, in spline interpolation simulating the function of flat spline s. The term spline is derived from a flexible strip of metal commonly used by draftsmen to assist in drawing curved lines. [ Katz, Mitchell H. Multivariable Analysis: A Practical Guide for Clinicians and Public Health Researchers Cambridge University Press 2011 978-0-521-14107-9 82 http://books.google.com/books?id%3D-X4G4dHsARQC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA82 ]. [ Definition ] A spline is a piecewise - polynomial real function S: [a,b]\to \mathbb{R} on an interval [a,b] composed of k ordered disjoint subintervals [t_{i-1}, t_i] with a = t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_{k-1} &lt; t_k = b. The restriction of S to an interval i is a polynomial P_i: [t_{i-1}, t_i] \to \mathbb{R}, so that \vdots { S(t) = P_k (t) \mbox{, } t_{k-1} \le t \le t_k. } The highest order of the polynomials P_i (t) is said to be the order of the spline S. If all subintervals are of the same length, the spline is said to be uniform and non-uniform otherwise. [ Fan, Jianqing &amp; Yao, Qiwei Spline Methods Nonlinear time series: nonparametric and parametric methods Springer 2005 978-0-387-26142-3 247 http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dp5E1LVJ2C-0C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA247 ] The idea is to choose the polynomials in a way that guarantees sufficient smoothness of S. Specifically, for a spline of order n, S is required to be continuously differentiable to order n-1 at the interior points t_i : for all i=1, \dots, k-1 and all j \quad 0 \le j \le n-1, P_i^{(j)} (t_i) = P_{i+1}^{(j)} (t_i). [ Derivation of a cubic spline interpolating between points ] [ Spline interpolation ] This is one of the most important uses of splines. [ Examples ] The bell-shaped Irwin-Hall spline The second derivative of the spline above A simple example of a quadratic spline (a spline of degree 2) is S(t) = \begin{cases} (t+1)^2-1 &amp; -2 \le t &lt; 0\\ 1-(t-1)^2 &amp; 0 \le t \le 2 \end{cases} for which S&apos;(0)=2. A simple example of a cubic spline is S(t) = \left|t\right|^3 as S(t) = \begin{cases} t^3 &amp; t \ge 0\\ -t^3 &amp; t &lt; 0 \end{cases} and S(0)&apos; =\ 0 S(0)&apos;&apos; =\ 0 An example of using a cubic spline to create a bell shaped curve is the Irwin-Hall polynomials: f_X(x)= \begin{cases} \frac{1}{4}(x+2)^3 &amp; -2\le x \le -1\\ \frac{1}{4}\left(3|x|^3 - 6x^2 +4 \right) &amp; -1\le x \le 1\\ \frac{1}{4}(2-x)^3 &amp; 1\le x \le 2 \end{cases} [ History ] Before computers were used, numerical calculations were done by hand. Functions such as the step function were used but polynomials were generally preferred. With the advent of computers, splines first replaced polynomials in interpolation, and then served in construction of smooth and flexible shapes in computer graphics. { Epperson, History of Splines, NA Digest, vol. 98, no. 26, 1998. } It is commonly accepted that the first mathematical reference to splines is the 1946 paper by Schoenberg, { Schoenberg, Contributions to the problem of approximation of equidistant data by analytic functions, Quart. Appl. Math., vol. 4, pp. 45–99 and 112–141, 1946. } which is probably the first place that the word &quot; spline &quot; is used in connection with smooth, piecewise polynomial approximation. However, the ideas have their roots in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries. In the foreword to (Bartels et al., 1987), { Bartels, Beatty, and Barsky, An Introduction to Splines for Use in Computer Graphics and Geometric Modeling, 1987. } Robin Forrest describes &quot; lofting &quot;, a technique used in the British aircraft industry during World War II to construct templates for airplanes by passing thin wooden strips (called &quot; spline s &quot; ) through points laid out on the floor of a large design loft, a technique borrowed from ship-hull design. For years the practice of ship design had employed models to design in the small. The successful design was then plotted on graph paper and the key points of the plot were re-plotted on larger graph paper to full size. The thin wooden strips provided an interpolation of the key points into smooth curves. The strips would be held in place at discrete points (called &quot; ducks &quot; by Forrest; Schoenberg used &quot; dogs &quot; or &quot; rats &quot; ) and between these points would assume shapes of minimum strain energy. According to Forrest, one possible impetus for a mathematical model for this process was the potential loss of the critical design components for an entire aircraft should the loft be hit by an enemy bomb. This gave rise to &quot; conic lofting &quot;, which used conic sections to model the position of the curve between the ducks. Conic lofting was replaced by what we would call splines in the early 1960s based on work by J. C. Ferguson { Ferguson, James C, Multi-variable curve interpolation, J. ACM, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 221-228, Apr. 1964. } at Boeing and (somewhat later) by M.A. Sabin at British Aircraft Corporation. The word &quot; spline &quot; was originally an East Anglian dialect word. [ spline ] The use of splines for modeling automobile bodies seems to have several independent beginnings. Credit is claimed on behalf of de Casteljau at Citroën, Pierre Bézier at Renault, and Birkhoff, { Birkhoff, Fluid dynamics, reactor computations, and surface representation, in: Steve Nash (ed.), A History of Scientific Computation, 1990. } Garabedian, and de Boor at General Motors (see Birkhoff and de Boor, 1965), { Birkhoff and de Boor, Piecewise polynomial interpolation and approximation, in: H. L. Garabedian (ed.), Proc. General Motors Symposium of 1964, pp. 164–190. Elsevier, New York and Amsterdam, 1965. } all for work occurring in the very early 1960s or late 1950s. At least one of de Casteljau&apos;s papers was published, but not widely, in 1959. De Boor&apos;s work at General Motors resulted in a number of papers being published in the early 1960s, including some of the fundamental work on B-spline s. { Davis, B-splines and Geometric design, SIAM News, vol. 29, no. 5, 1997. } Work was also being done at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, where two of the authors of (Ahlberg et al., 1967) { Ahlberg, Nilson, and Walsh, The Theory of Splines and Their Applications, 1967. } — the first book-length treatment of splines — were employed, and the David Taylor Model Basin, by Feodor Theilheimer. The work at General Motors is detailed nicely in (Birkhoff, 1990) and (Young, 1997). { Young, Garrett Birkhoff and applied mathematics, Notices of the AMS, vol. 44, no. 11, pp. 1446–1449, 1997. } Davis (1997) summarizes some of this material.
