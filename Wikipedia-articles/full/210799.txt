It ranges from Mexico to southern Peru, showing three extant subspecies. The Subbittern show both morphological and molecular similarities with the Kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) of New Caledonia, indicating an gondwanic origin, being both placed in the clade Eurypygiformes. { del Hoyo, J.

Altogether, the bird is most similar to another enigmatic bird that was provisionally placed in the Gruiformes, the Kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus). { Houde et al.

Pp. 121–158. } Molecular studies seem to confirm that the Kagu and Sunbittern are each other&apos;s closest living relatives. { Fain &amp; Houde (2004) Parallel radiations in the primary clades of birds. } { Evolution 58(11): 2558–2573. } { Ericson et al.

(2008) Bird evolution: testing the Metaves clade with six new mitochondrial genomes. BMC Evolutionary Biology 8 (20). } Altogether, the two species seem to form a minor Gondwana n lineage which could also include the extinct adzebill s and/or the mesite s, and is of unclear relation to the Gruiformes proper. Notably, the Kagu and mesites also have powder down. [ Subespecies ] There were formely two species (E. helias and E. major) but now E. helias is divided in three subspecies differentiated by plumage characters and size. The three subespecias are apparently allopatry. E. h. helias, live in the east of the Andes in lowland tropical South America, from the Orinoco basin, through the Amazonia. E. h. major, it´s found at higher altitudes ranging from southern Mexico to Ecuador. E. h. meridionalis, occurs in southern central Peru, in the lower subtropical zone at 800-1830 m. [ Description and reproduction ] Camouflaging coloration Song The bird has a generally subdued coloration, with fine linear patterns of black, grey and brown. Its remiges however have vividly-colored middle webs, which with wings fully spread show bright eyespots in red, yellow, and black. These are shown to other sunbitterns in courtship and threat displays, or used to startle potential predators. Male and female adult Sunbitterns have can be differentiated by small differences in the feather patterns of the throat and head. Like some other birds, the Sunbittern has powder down. The Sunbittern have a long and pointed bill, a short hallux as in shorebirds and rails, orange-yellow feets present in the lowland individuals in the east of the Andes, while the Central America species (E. h. major) are much redder. [ Distribution and habitat ] The Sunbittern&apos;s range extends from Guatemala to Brazil, in the humid Neotropical forests, generally with and open understorey adn near rivers and streams. The species may also be present in southern Mexico. It has been traditionally reported from the Atlantic slope of Chiapas, but no specimens are known and there have been no recent records. { Howell, Steve N. G. and Webb, Sophie (1995) } { A guide to the birds of Mexico and Northern Central America ISBN 0-19-854012-4 } [ Behaviour and ecology ] The Sunbittern is a non-migrant bird that is normally found foraging on the ground and scratching for insects. They are cryptic birds that display their large wings, that exhibits a patron that resemble eyes, when they feel threatened. Sunbitterns start nesting in the early wet season and before it start they make fligth displays 10-15 m high in the forest canopy. They build open nests in trees, and lay two eggs with blotched markings. The young are precocial, but remain in the nest for several weeks after hatching.
