The Panther was the first jet aircraft used by the } { Blue Angels } { flight team, being used by them from 1949 through to late 1954. } [ Design and development ] The XF9F-2 and XF9F-3 prototypes in 1948 Development studies at the Grumman company began near the end of the World War II as the first jet engines emerged. The prototype Panther, piloted by test pilot Corky Meyer, first flew on 24 November 1947. { Meyer 2002 } Propulsion was an imported Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet, although production aircraft would have a Nene engine built under license by Pratt &amp; Whitney as the J42. Since there was insufficient space within the wings and fuselage for fuel for the thirsty jet, permanently mounted wingtip fuel tanks were added, which incidentally improved the fighter&apos;s rate of roll. { Winchester 2004, p. 96. } It was cleared for flight from aircraft carriers in September 1949. During the development phase, Grumman decided to change the Panther&apos;s engine, selecting the Pratt &amp; Whitney J48-P-2, a license built version of the Rolls-Royce RB.44 Tay. The other engine that had been tested was the Allison J33-A-16. The armament was a quartet of 20  mm guns, the Navy having already switch ed to this caliber (as opposed to the USAAF/USAF which continued to use 12.7  mm M2/M3 guns). Panther soon was armed as well with underwing air-to ground rockets and bombs, up to 2,000  lbs. From 1946, a swept-wing version was considered and after concerns about the Panther&apos;s inferiority to its MiG opponents in Korea, a conversion of the Panther (Design 93) resulted in a swept-wing derivative of the Panther, the Grumman F9F Cougar, which retained the Panther&apos;s designation number. { Taylor 1969, p. 506. } [ Operational history ] [ US Navy ] A VF-111 F9F-2 dropping bombs in Korea, 1951/52 F9F-2s, F9F-3s and F9F-5s served with distinction in the Korean War, mainly as attack aircraft, showing noticeable resistance to anti-aircraft fire; despite their relative slow speed, they also managed in downing two Yak-9s and five Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 s for the loss of two F9Fs. On 3 July 1950, Lieutenant, junior grade Leonard H. Plog of U.S. Navy&apos;s VF-51 flying an F9F-3 scored the first U.S. Navy air victory of the war by shooting down a Yak-9. The first MiG-15 downed was on 9 November 1950 by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander William (Bill) Amen of VF-111 &quot; Sundowners &quot; Squadron flying an F9F-2B. Two more were downed on 18 November 1950, and the other two were downed on 18 November 1952. { Grossnick and Armstrong 1997 } The type was the primary Navy and USMC jet fighter and ground-attack aircraft in the Korean War. Future astronaut Neil Armstrong flew the F9F extensively during the war, even ejecting from one of the aircraft when it was brought down by a wire strung across a valley. Future astronaut John Glenn and Boston Red Sox All Star Ted Williams also flew the F9F as Marine Corps pilots. Panthers were withdrawn from front-line service in 1956, but remained in training roles and with Naval Air Reserve and Marine Air Reserve units until 1958, some continuing to serve in small numbers into the 1960s. { Winchester 2004, p. 97. } [ Argentine Navy ] The only foreign buyer of the Panther was the Argentine Naval Aviation, who bought 24 ex-USN aircraft in 1958. The catapults on the then only Argentinian carrier, ARA &apos;&apos;Independencia&apos;&apos; (V-1), were considered not powerful enough to launch the F9F, so the aircraft were land-based. The Argentinian Panthers were involved in the general mobilization during the 1965 border clash between Argentina and Chile but no combat occurred. They were taken out of service in 1969 due to the lack of spare parts and replaced with A-4Q Skyhawks. { &quot; Panther. &quot; Pictorial and history in Argentine service. Retrieved: 19 July 2011. } The Argentinian Navy operated the Grumman F-9 Cougar as well. [ Variants ] Two F9F-2Bs of VF-721 over Korea. F9F-5s of VF-111 on the Lake Champlain CV-39 6 in 1953. F9F-5P reconnaissance aircraft F9F and AJ &apos;&apos;Savage&apos;&apos; of the NATC during in-flight refueling tests in 1953 XF9F-2 The first two prototypes XF9F-3 The third prototype F9F-2 First production version, powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney J42 engine. F9F-2B Version fitted with underwing racks for bombs and rockets. All F9F-2s were eventually so modified, and the B designation was dropped. F9F-2P Unarmed photographic reconnaissance version used in Korea. F9F-3 Allison J33 powered version produced as insurance against the failure of the J42, 54 built. All converted to J42 power later. XF9F-4 Prototype used in the development of the F9F-4. F9F-4 Version with longer fuselage with greater fuel load and powered by J33 engine. Most re-engined with J42s. F9F-4s were the first aircraft to successfully employ blown air, extracted from between the engine&apos;s compressor and combustion chambers, to energize the slot flaps, thus achieving a decrease in stalling speed of 9  kn for takeoff and 7  kn on power approach for landing. F9F-5 Variant of F9F-4, but powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney J48 engine, 616 built. F9F-5P Unarmed photo- reconnaissance version, 36 built, longer nose. F9F-5K After the F9F Panther was withdrawn operational service, a number of F9F-5s were converted into unmanned target drone aircraft. F9F-5KD As drone directors for the F9F-5K drones. Redesignated DF-9E in 1962.

The F9F was featured in the flying sequences in the 1954 movie The Bridges at Toko-Ri, although in the 1953 James A. Michener novel upon which the movie was based, the main character flew a McDonnell F2H Banshee.
