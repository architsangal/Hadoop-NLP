[ September 2009 ] [ February 2012 ] The Liaden universe (pronounced [ liːˈeɪdɛn ] [ lee AY den ] or [ liːˈeɪdən ] ) is the setting for an ongoing series of science fiction stories written by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller. The series covers a considerable time period, some thousands of years in all, although since it also covers more than one universe the exact chronology is unclear. [ 2010 ] the series comprises thirteen novels and sixteen chapbook s; one further novel will be published in August 2011, [ 2011 08 31 ] and three further novels have been contracted for. [ Overview ] The series is set at some unspecified time in the future. There is a reference to the planet named &quot; Terra &quot; not being the first planet to bear that name; however, the familiar names and cultural references in the core books (coupled with a lack of them in the &quot; Crystal &quot; books) suggest that it is &quot; our &quot; earth nonetheless. In the wake of a diaspora from a &quot; decrystallizing &quot; galaxy that was mankind&apos;s prior home, the human race is divided into three major sub-races: Terran, Liaden and Yxtrang. (There are also numerous isolated colony planets that have backslid technologically and are held as protectorates until their civilizations regain enough advances to cope with extraplanetary contact.) The seven-book &quot; Agent of Change &quot; sequence tells of the struggle between Clan Korval, a Liaden Clan of much note, and the mysterious &quot; Department of the Interior &quot;. The eighth novel, Balance of Trade, is set 275 years prior to the end of the &quot; Agent of Change &quot; sequence. It features Jethri Gobelyn, a young Terran trader who is adopted by a Liaden Master Trader to the consternation of virtually everyone. The ninth novel, Crystal Soldier, published in February 2005, takes place even earlier still: it is the first half of &quot; The Great Migration Duology &quot;, and tells the story of Cantra yos&apos;Phelium, who piloted the original exodus to Liad, and her partner Jela. The sequel, Crystal Dragon, was published in 2006 and takes the story up through the founding of Liad and of Clan Korval. There is a timeline of the Liaden stories, as of the state of the Universe in 2002, in the Liaden Unibus II. [ History of the series ] The series is notable because it almost failed to take flight, and probably would only be three books long except for the Internet. The authors had written the first three books (Agent of Change, Conflict of Honors, Carpe Diem) but were told that sales were not sufficient to justify continuing. Unbeknownst to them the books had caused such a stir on the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written that they were added to the group&apos;s FAQ. [ http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sf/written-faq/ rec.arts.sf.written Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 2001-06-18 2007-05-23 ] Upon gaining Internet access, the authors were surprised to find so many people looking for the next book, and even more surprised that its title was already decided upon: Plan B. They published some chapbook s to stave off the hungry fans and started writing: Plan B and a further three books followed in due course to complete the &quot; Agent of Change &quot; sequence. There are also a number of short stories, some filling in gaps between novels, some providing background on minor (and not so minor) characters. The series is ongoing [ 2010 on ]. [ Books in the series ] The first three novels were originally published in mass-market by Del Rey. The novels were later re-published, along with several subsequent novels, by the now-defunct Meisha Merlin, who have also anthologised the earlier novels. The novels were then re-issued in mass-market by Ace Books. All books and many of the stories were formerly available in electronic form from Embiid Publishing, which is now out of business. In 2007, Baen Books published the first 10 Liaden novels in electronic form, followed by two short story collections. Baen began publishing new Liaden novels in 2009, and in 2010 began releasing the first 10 Liaden novels in omnibus trade paperbacks.

[ Liaden ] Home planet &quot; Liad &quot;. Liadens are usually shorter than the Terran norm, often with golden skin. They are deeply concerned with their melant&apos;i which roughly corresponds to the concern with &quot; face &quot; for which Japanese Samurai are famous. Some are almost rabidly isolationist; it is not uncommon for Liaden to refer to those of other races as &quot; it &quot; likening them to animals. Several characters are part- or even half-Terran: this does not endear them to the isolationists. Liaden society is clan-based, each Clan being made up of one or more families ( &quot; lines &quot; ). The Head of a Clan is the &quot; Delm &quot;, the head of a line is the &quot; Thodelm &quot;; either might be male or female as circumstances dictate. Some Liaden are trained as explorers: the Scouts. They are regarded with distaste by the more isolationist within Liaden society. Most of the stories thus far centre on members of Clan Korval, made up of the yos&apos;Phelium and yos&apos;Galan lines. Scouts also appear often. Korval Val Con yos&apos;Phelium - Delm, ex-Scout, husband to Miri, Shan yos&apos;Galan - Master Trader, foster-brother to Val Con (current incarnation of Lute) Daav yos&apos;Phelium - ex-Delm, ex-Scout, father to Val Con and Theo Waitley Aelliana Caylon - wife to Daav, mother to Val Con Er Thom yos&apos;Galan - Master Trader, husband of Anne Davis, father to Shan, Nova and Anthora Pat Rin yos&apos;Phelium - cousin to Val Con Kareen yos&apos;Phelium - sister to Daav, mother to Pat Rin, expert on &quot; The Code of proper conduct &quot; Anthora yos&apos;Galan - sister to Shan and Nova, with preternatural (Dramliza) abilities Ren Zel dea&apos;Judan - husband to Anthora,with preternatural (Dramliza) abilities Nova yos&apos;Galan - sister to Shan, Anthora and Val Con Luken bel&apos;Tarda - cousin, rug dealer, foster father of Pat Rin, guardian of the children (not listed here) Others Jan Rek ter&apos;Astin - Scout Captain, friend of Jethri Gobelyn Clonak ter&apos;Meulen - Scout, friend of Daav and Val Con Shadia ne&apos;Zame - Scout, friend of Clonak [ Terran ] Home planet known as &quot; Terra &quot;. As remarked above, there is a brief reference to the possibility that this planet is possibly the fourth of that name. At least one prior Terra would have been destroyed along with the war-torn universe/Galaxy from which mankind fled in Crystal Dragon. From cultural references, familiar English names, and references to regional linguistic dialects that appear in the core books, it seems likely that this Terra is nonetheless our own Earth. There appears to be some resentment that the &quot; younger &quot; races (usually Liaden) hold more power in the realm of shipping and commerce than Terra; there is reference to at least one political party involved in less-than-legal operations. The Juntavas are an organized-crime &quot; clan &quot; who appear in various guises, sometimes as antagonists, sometimes as allies of the main characters. Unlike the real-world mafia, the Juntavas are apparently able to act as an unopposed organized government in their own right, to the point of having appointed officials called Sector Judges who administer justice within their appointed jurisdictions. The Juntavas are usually not as oppressive as they might be, because they have learned that too much of that sort of thing is &quot; bad for business. &quot; A number of other planets are known to have non-Liaden human inhabitants, presumably of the Terran strain. Some of these worlds, such as Surebleak and Delgado, were settled by Terrans from this universe&apos;s Terra. Others, such as Sintia, were settled by ships from the same Crystal Dragon-era colonization waves as Liad and Terra. Some of these colony worlds, such as Vandar, have backslid to pre-spaceflight technology levels. These worlds have been considered interdicted by the Liaden Scout Corps, with external contact forbidden in order to permit their societies to develop without interference. As of &quot; Prodigal Son, &quot; post-I Dare, there are signs that this policy may be changing. Gobelyns Jethri Gobelyn - apprentice trader, apprenticed to Norn ven&apos;Deelin Iza Gobelyn - Captain of Gobelyn&apos;s Market, mother to Cris, Seeli, Jethri Arin Gobelyn - deceased, husband to Iza, father to Jethri, related to Uncle Cris Gobelyn - first mate of Gobelyn&apos;s Market, Iza&apos;s eldest child Dyk Gobelyn - junior on Gobelyn&apos;s Market, cook Khatelane Gobelyn - pilot on Gobelyn&apos;s Market Mel Gobelyn - on Gobelyn&apos;s Market Paitor Gobelyn - trader on Gobelyn&apos;s Market, brother to Iza Seeli Gobelyn - admin on Gobelyn&apos;s Market, Iza&apos;s second child Zam Gobelyn - on Gobelyn&apos;s Market Grig Tomas - back-up everything on Gobelyn&apos;s Market, Arin&apos;s cousin, related to Uncle Korval clan-members Anne Davis - wife to Er Thom, mother to Shan, master linguist and musician Priscilla Delacroix y Mendoza - wife to Shan (current incarnation of Moonhawk) Miri Robertson - half-Liaden ex-mercenary, wife to Val Con and joint Delm (Delmae) Inas Bhar - Juntavas Sector Judge Natesa the Assassin, wife of Pat Rin Korval-linked Theo Waitley - recently discovered (to the rest of the Korval) daughter to Daav yos&apos;Phelium but not seen by Delm Korval until Ghost Ship Cheever McFarland - Master Pilot, messenger to Korval, then Pat Rin&apos;s partner Others &quot; Uncle &quot; - A mysterious collector and user of ancient technology, with ties to Cantra and to some crewmembers of Gobelyn&apos;s Market. Hakan Meltz - Val Con and Miri&apos;s musical friend on Vandar Estra Trelu - person Val Con and Miri stayed with on Vandar Athna Brigsbee - Vandar busybody Kem Darmill - Hakan Meltz&apos; girlfriend and later (by the time of Prodigal Son) wife. various Juntavas various people on Surebleak various people on Vandar [ Yxtrang ] Home planet unknown at this time. Usually much larger than the Terran norm, they are a war-like people who live for conquest. They are almost universally prone to thinking of the other human races as animals. References in Crystal Soldier and Crystal Dragon suggest that the Yxtrang are the descendants of a group of &quot; X Strain &quot; and &quot; Y Strain &quot; genetically-engineered soldiers who served in a platoon with Jela and accompanied the human migration to the new universe.Some of them venerate Jela (an &quot; M Strain &quot; ) for his skills and deeds as a warrior. It is not known whether they can interbreed with Liadens or Terrans, though given their common genetic origin there is no reason why they should not be able to; the likely lifespan of such offspring is short, not for merely biological reasons. Nelirikk - ex-Explorer (equivalent to Scout), subsequently sworn to Line yos&apos;Phelium, becomes Miri&apos;s bodyguard; aka &quot; Beautiful &quot; Hazenthull Explorer - junior Explorer, subsequently sworn to Line yos&apos;Phelium Diglon Rifle - enlisted soldier attached to Hazenthull, subsequently sworn to Line yos&apos;Phelium [ Clutch Turtles ] These non-humans are even larger than Yxtrang and very long-lived; they appear much like turtles walking upright, hence the name. Their names are correspondingly long: Edger&apos;s full name apparently takes some hours to recite. They are usually slow to act but are very dangerous when angered. Clutch turtles travel in starships made from hollowed-out asteroids using an electron substitution drive that can have hallucinogenic effects on the human nervous system. They are able to command forces of great destructive or healing potential by singing. Clutch turtles are greatly feared and avoided by the Yxtrang as the result of a resounding defeat in battle many years prior to the timeframe of the story. The Clutch turtles encountered in the &quot; Agent of Change &quot; sequence make up a &quot; market research &quot; team on behalf of their clan, who are known for manufacturing crystalline blades of extreme sharpness and durability by growing them in caves over a timespan of decades. Edger Sheather Watcher Selector Handler [ Cats ] There are many cats which appear in the stories, usually by name, often taking an active part in the proceedings. Unlike ordinary housecats, these cats often display paranormal abilities, as well as considerable intelligence. Flinx - at Tarnia&apos;s Clanhouse Lord Merlin - Anthora&apos;s cat, very active in I Dare Patch - Binjali Repair Shop&apos;s resident cat and &quot; co-owner &quot; Lady Dignity- Daav yos&apos;Phelium&apos;s answer to his sister&apos;s complaint that he has none Relchin - An orange-and-white cat who &quot; enjoys the outdoors &quot; also resides with Daav yos&apos;Phelium Silk - Pat Rin&apos;s mouser and majordomo on Surebleak Charzi - lives in the Lysta Clanhouse in &quot; Misfits &quot; Coyster - Jen Sar Kiladi&apos;s cat, attached to Theo Waitley on Delgado in Fledgling Mandrin - Jen Sar Kiladi&apos;s black and white on Delgado [ Trees ] An unusual character is Jelaza Kazone (a term that has been translated as &quot; Jela&apos;s Promise, &quot; &quot; Jela&apos;s Contract, &quot; or &quot; Jela&apos;s Dream, &quot; among other variants) and the seedlings thereof (of which only two have thus far appeared in narrative). This very large tree lives in the grounds of Clan Korval&apos;s primary residence (also called Jelaza Kazone) and is in the habit of communicating its likes and dislikes to senior members of that clan; it has particularly been noted to have an interest in the likely parents of future children of the Clan. As a young soldier, Jela found the tree on a desert planet on which his ship had crashed. Though barely a stunted seedling and the last member of a dying race, the tree was by itself able to repel invasion of the planet by the enemy Sheriekas. As an act of trust, the tree gave its only seed pod to feed the starving Jela. When Jela&apos;s rescue came, he refused to leave the tree behind. The tree proved to be intelligent, and able to communicate via mental images. It also had the ability to manipulate the chemistry of its seed pods to create useful pharmaceutical compounds. Both these powers proved useful as Jela and Cantra searched for information necessary for mankind to escape its collapsing universe. The name Jelaza Kazone refers to the promise Cantra yos&apos;Phelium made to Jela, who knew he was destined to die before the migration could be complete, to see the tree through to safety on the new human homeworld. Clan Korval holds itself the guardian of this promise in perpetuity, and every trading vessel of Korval carries a seed of the tree somewhere on board, to ensure the survival of its race. Seedling mentioned in Plan B at Erob&apos;s Clan house on Lytaxin. Seedling was installed on Cantra&apos;s ship at the end of Crystal Dragon [ Concepts ] [ Melant&apos;i ] A great deal of the Liaden culture centers on melant&apos;i. Part of this concept is roughly analogous to personal honor or good manners: a person of impeccable melant&apos;i will behave in a certain way, in a given situation. It is also used to distinguish between a person&apos;s different roles in life. If one is speaking to a shipmate in one&apos;s role as an officer of the ship, one uses a particular mode to cue the shipmate as to the formality of the situation, and is said to be expressing one&apos;s melant&apos;i as that officer. If, on the other hand, one is speaking to the same shipmate, but in the role of daughter, one uses a different mode and is expressing the melant&apos;i as a family member. Different levels of formality, and actions, will be appropriate in each case. [ Space travel ] Human ships are able to travel quickly between planets by &quot; jumping &quot;; different technologies exist but are all fairly quick; journey durations are comparable to swift sea-travel here on Earth. Only the Clutch Turtles use a different method, with predictably idiosyncratic side-effects (of which few details are available).
