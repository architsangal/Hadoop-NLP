[ 1997 12 18 ] { 10.5 (Beta) } { April 11, 2012 } { Delphi } { Microsoft Windows } { Digital Audio Workstation } { Proprietary } { http://shop.image-line.com } FL Studio (formerly known as FruityLoops { Accessed October 27, 2011. } ) is a digital audio workstation developed by the Belgian company Image-Line. FL Studio features a graphical user interface based on a pattern-based music sequencer. The program is available in four different editions for Microsoft Windows, including FL Studio Express, Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, and the Signature Bundle. Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, meaning customers receive for free all future updates of the software. Image-Line also develops FL Studio Mobile for the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad. FL Studio can be used as a VST instrument in other audio workstation programs and will also function as a ReWire client. Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio is used by electronic music ians and DJ s such as Afrojack and 9th Wonder. [ History ] The first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin for the Belgian company Image-Line and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel MIDI drum machine. Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program, and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex digital audio workstation. FL Studio has undergone ten major updates since its inception, and FL Studio 10 was released in March 2011. Noted programmer Arguru contributed to various editions of FL Studio. [ Software overview ] [ Editions ] FL Studio Express – This version allows for step sequencer -only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step loop creation. Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments—either samples, native, or VST instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, Equo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ &amp; EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no piano roll, playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/ ReWire client. FL Studio Mobile version 1.0 for iOS Fruity Edition – The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, piano roll, and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be used as an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, Logic, and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live synthesizer instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature. Producer Edition – The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based splines. Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), Vocodex, and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points. Signature Bundle – This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as Sytrus, Maximus, the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite. Free Demo – The free demo version includes all of the program&apos;s features and most plugins and allows users to render project audio to WAV, MIDI, MP3, and OGG. Mobile – On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released FL Studio Mobile, which supports the ability to create multi-track projects on iOS devices such as iPod Touch es, iPhone s, and iPad s. [ System requirements ] FL Studio 10.0 works on Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / 7 ( 32-bit or 64-bit versions) or on Intel Macs with Boot Camp. It requires a 2 GHz AMD or Intel Pentium 3 CPU with full SSE1 support. It requires 1 GB of free disk space and at least 1 GB of RAM is recommended. FL Studio processes audio using an internal 32-bit floating point engine. It supports sampling rate s up to 192  kHz using either WDM or ASIO enabled drivers. [ Program features ] Version 11 is currently under development. [ October 2011 ] Version 10, introduced on March 29, 2011, included a new project browser, fixed some bugs, and smoothed envelope points. It also introduced a patcher. [ October 2011 ] Version 9 introduced support for multi-core effects processing and improved support for multi-core instrument processing. The mixer interface allows for any number of channel configurations. This allows mixing in 2.1, 5.1, or 7.1 surround sound, as long as the output hardware interface has an equivalent number of outputs. The mixer also supports audio-in, enabling FL Studio to record multitrack audio. FL Studio supports time stretching/pitch shifting, beat slicing, chopping, and editing of audio, and as of version 8 it can record up to 64 simultaneous audio tracks. Other key features include a digital piano roll. Audio can be imported or exported as WAV, MP3, OGG, MIDI, ZIP, or the native project format with an.FLP filename extension.
