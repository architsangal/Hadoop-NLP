This salt exists as a series of compounds that differ in their degree of hydration. The anhydrous form is a pale green or gray-white powder, whereas the pentahydrate (CuSO 4 ·5H 2 O), the most commonly encountered salt, is bright blue. Copper sulfate exothermically dissolves in water to give the aquo complex [Cu(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+, which has octahedral molecular geometry and is paramagnetic. Other names for copper(II) sulfate are &quot; blue vitriol &quot; and &quot; bluestone &quot;. [ Oxford University Copper(II) sulfate MSDS http://ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/CO/copper_II_sulfate.html 2007-12-31 ] [ Preparation and occurrence ] Preparation of copper(II) sulfate by electrolyzing sulfuric acid, using copper electrodes Copper sulfate is produced industrially by treating copper metal with hot concentrated sulfuric acid or its oxides with dilute sulfuric acid. For laboratory use, copper sulfate is usually purchased. The anhydrous form occurs as a rare mineral known as chalcocyanite. The hydrated copper sulfate occurs in nature as chalcanthite (pentahydrate), and two more rare ones: bonattite (trihydrate) and boothite (heptahydrate). [ Chemical properties ] Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate decomposes before melting at 150  °C, losing two water molecules at 63  °C, followed by two more at 109  °C and the final water molecule at 200  °C.

The second dehydration step occurs with the final two aqua groups are lost. Complete dehydration occurs when the only unbound water molecule is lost. At 650  °C, copper(II) sulfate decomposes into copper(II) oxide (CuO) and sulfur trioxide (SO 3 ). Its blue color is due to water of hydration. When heated in an open flame the crystals are dehydrated and turn grayish-white. [ Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. Inorganic Chemistry Academic Press San Diego 2001 0-12-352651-5 ] Copper sulfate reacts with concentrated hydrochloric acid very strongly. In the reaction the blue solution of copper(II) turns green, due to the formation of tetrachlorocuprate(II): Cu 2+ + 4  Cl – → CuCl 4 2– It also reacts with more reactive metals than copper (e.g. Mg, Fe, Zn, Al, Sn, Pb, etc.): CuSO 4 + Zn → ZnSO 4 + Cu CuSO 4 + Fe → FeSO 4 + Cu CuSO 4 + Mg → MgSO 4 + Cu CuSO 4 + Sn → SnSO 4 + Cu 3 CuSO 4 + 2 Al → Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 + 3 Cu The copper formed is deposited on the surface of the other metal. The reaction stops when no free surface of the metal is present anymore. [ Uses ] [ As a herbicide, fungicide and pesticide ] Copper sulfate pentahydrate is a fungicide. [ Johnson, George Fiske The Early History of Copper Fungicides Agricultural History 9 2 67–79 1935 3739659 ] However, some fungi are capable of adapting to elevated levels of copper ions. [ Parry K. E. Wood R. K. S. The adaption of fungi to fungicides: Adaption to copper and mercury salts Annals of Applied Biology 46 446 1958 10.1111/j.1744-7348.1958.tb02225.x 3 ] Mixed with lime it is called Bordeaux mixture and used to control fungus on grapes, melons, and other berries. [ Uses of Copper Compounds: Copper Sulfate&apos;s Role in Agriculture Copper.org 2007-12-31 http://www.copper.org/applications/compounds/copper_sulfate02.html ] Another application is Cheshunt compound, a mixture of copper sulfate and ammonium carbonate used in horticulture to prevent damping off in seedlings. Its use as a herbicide is not agricultural, but instead for control of invasive aquatic plants and the roots of plants near pipes containing water. It is used in swimming pools as an algaecide. A dilute solution of copper sulfate is used to treat aquarium fish for parasitic infections, [ All About Copper Sulfate National Fish Pharmaceuticals http://www.fishyfarmacy.com/Q%26amp%3BA/all_about_copper.html 2007-12-31 ] and is also used to remove snails from aquariums. Copper ions are highly toxic to fish, so care must be taken with the dosage. Most species of algae can be controlled with very low concentrations of copper sulfate. Copper sulfate inhibits growth of bacteria such as Escherichia  coli. For most of the twentieth century, chromated copper arsenate (CCA) was the dominant type of wood preservation for uses other than deep driven pile s, utility pole s, and railroad tie s. To make pressure-treated wood, a large cylinder is filled with an aqueous chemical bath. Copper sulfate pentahydrate is dissolved in the water along with other additives prior to the lumber being placed inside the cylinder. When the cylinder is pressurized, the chemicals are absorbed by the wood, giving the wood fungicidal, insecticidal, and UV-light -reflecting properties that help preserve it. [ Niche uses ] Being a relatively benign and cheap reagent, copper(II) sulfate has attracted many niche applications over the centuries. [ Analytical reagent ] Several chemical tests utilize copper sulfate. It is used in Fehling&apos;s solution and Benedict&apos;s solution to test for reducing sugar s, which reduce the soluble blue copper(II) sulfate to insoluble red copper(I) oxide. Copper(II) sulfate is also used in the Biuret reagent to test for proteins. Copper sulfate is also used to test blood for anemia. The blood is tested by dropping it into a solution of copper sulfate of known specific gravity  – blood which contains sufficient hemoglobin sinks rapidly due to its density, whereas blood which does not, floats or sinks less rapidly. [ Basic Medical Laboratory Techniques Barbara H. Estridge, Anna P. Reynolds, Norma J. Walters 166 Thomson Delmar Learning 2000 0-7668-1206-5 ] In a flame test, its copper ion s emit a deep blue-green light, much more blue than the flame test for barium. [ Organic synthesis ] Copper sulfate is employed in organic synthesis. [ Hoffman, R. V. Copper(II) Sulfate, in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons 10.1002/047084289X.rc247 ] The anhydrous salt catalyses the trans acetyl ation in organic synthesis.

Because of its toxicity, it is not recommended for small children. Copper sulfate is often used to demonstrate an exothermic reaction, in which steel wool or magnesium ribbon is placed in an aqueous solution of CuSO 4. It is used in school chemistry courses to demonstrate the principle of mineral hydration. The pentahydrate form, which is blue, is heated, turning the copper sulfate into the anhydrous form which is white, while the water that was present in the pentahydrate form evaporates. When water is then added to the anhydrous compound, it turns back into the pentahydrate form, regaining its blue color, and is known as blue copperas. [ 2009-07-07 http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4315915.html Process for the preparation of stable copper (II) sulfate monohydrate applicable as trace element additive in animal fodders ] Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate can easily be produced by crystallization from solution as copper(II) sulfate is quite hygroscopic. In an illustration of a &quot; single metal replacement reaction, &quot; iron is submerged in a solution of copper sulfate. Upon standing, iron reacts, producing iron(II) sulfate, and copper precipitates. Fe + CuSO 4 → FeSO 4 + Cu Lowering a zinc etching plate into the copper sulfate solution. [ Medical ] Copper sulfate was also used in the past as an emetic.

[ Olson, Kent C. Poisoning &amp; drug overdose Lange Medical Mooks/McGraw-Hill New York 2004 175 0-8385-8172-2 ] It is still listed as an antidote in the World Health Organization &apos;s ATC code V03. [ V03 AB20 ] [ Art ] In 2008, the artist Roger Hiorns filled an abandoned waterproofed council flat in London with 75,000 liters of copper sulfate solution. The solution was left to crystallize for several weeks before the flat was drained, leaving crystal-covered walls, floors and ceilings. The work is titled Seizure.

[ Toxicological effects ] Copper sulfate is an irritant. { Windholz, M., ed. 1983. The Merck Index. Tenth edition.

Registry of toxic effects of chemical substances (RTECS). Cincinnati, OH: NIOSH. } Because of its irritating effect on the gastrointestinal tract, vomiting is automatically triggered in case of the ingestion of copper sulfate. However, if copper sulfate is retained in the stomach, the symptoms can be severe. After 1–12  grams of copper sulfate are swallowed, such poisoning signs may occur as a metallic taste in the mouth, burning pain in the chest, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, discontinued urination, which leads to yellowing of the skin. In case of copper sulfate poisoning, injury to the brain, stomach, liver, or kidneys may also occur.
