[ the video game Baby Boomer (video game) ] [ Post-World War II baby boom ] A baby boomer is a person who was born during the demographic Post-World War II baby boom between the years 1946 and 1964, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. [ http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/natproj.html Population Profile of the United States U.S. Census Bureau November 5, 2011 ] The term &quot; baby boomer &quot; is sometimes used in a cultural context. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve broad consensus of a precise definition, even within a given territory. Different groups, organizations, individuals, and scholars may have widely varying opinions on what constitutes a baby boomer, both technically and culturally. Ascribing universal attributes to a broad generation is difficult, and some observers believe that it is inherently impossible. Nonetheless, many people have attempted to determine the broad cultural similarities and historical impact of the generation, and thus the term has gained widespread popular usage. { CDC Bottom of this page http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus.htm &quot; Vital Statistics of the United States, 2003, Volume I, Natality &quot;, Table 1-1 &quot; Live births, birth rates, and fertility rates, by race: United States, 1909-2003. &quot; } Baby boomers are associated with a rejection or redefinition of traditional values; however, many commentators have disputed the extent of that rejection, noting the widespread continuity of values with older and younger generations. In Europe and North America boomers are widely associated with privilege, as many grew up in a time of widespread government subsidies in post-war housing and education, and increasing affluence.

They were also the generation that received peak levels of income, therefore they could reap the benefits of abundant levels of food, apparel, retirement programs, and sometimes even &quot; midlife crisis &quot; products. One feature of Boomers was that they tended to think of themselves as a special generation, very different from those that had come before. In the 1960s, as the relatively large numbers of young people became teenagers and young adults, they, and those around them, created a very specific rhetoric around their cohort, and the change they were bringing about. [ Owram Doug 1997 Born at the Right Time 0-8020-8086-3 Univ Of Toronto Press Toronto xi ] This rhetoric had an important impact in the self perceptions of the boomers, as well as their tendency to define the world in terms of generations, which was a relatively new phenomenon. The baby boom has been described variously as a &quot; shockwave &quot; and as &quot; the pig in the python. &quot; [ Jones Landon 1980 Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation Coward, McCann and Geoghegan New York ] By the sheer force of its numbers, the boomers were a demographic bulge that remodeled society as it passed through it. The term Generation Jones has sometimes been used to distinguish those born from 1954 onward from the earlier Baby Boomers.

The characteristics pertaining to the Golden Boomers are unique compared to those of the Traditionalist, the Generation X, and the Generation Y in population studies. In particular, with January 1, 2011 which &quot; officially &quot; started the Era of the Golden Boomers, &quot; the term &quot; the Golden Boomers &quot; began to generate significant impact on worldwide populations.

[ http://www.mbsolutions.com/biz/Info40.html Music Business Solutions: Music Biz Insight Mbsolutions.com 2010-08-02 ] In Ontario, Canada, one influential attempt to define the boom came from David Foot, author of Boom, Bust and Echo: Profiting from the Demographic Shift in the 21st Century, published in 1997 and 2000. He defines a Canadian boomer as someone born from 1947 to 1966, the years that more than 400,000 babies were born. However, he acknowledges that is a demographic definition, and that culturally it may not be as clear-cut.

He notes that those born in the years before the actual boom were often the most influential people among boomers; for example, The Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones [excluding Charlie Watts, he was born on June 2, 1941] to and writers like Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg who were considerably older than the boomer generation. Those born in the 1960s might well feel disconnected from the cultural identifiers of the earlier boomers.

[ Characteristics ] [ Size and economic impact ] Seventy-six million American children were born between 1945 and 1965, representing a cohort that is significant on account of its size alone. In 2004, the UK baby boomers held 80% of the UK&apos;s wealth and bought 80% of all top of the range cars, 80% of cruises and 50% of skincare products. { Walker, Duncan (Sept 16, 2004) &quot; Live Fast, Die Old &quot;, BBC News site. Retrieved 2007-01-26. } In addition to the size of the group, Steve Gillon has suggested that one thing that sets the baby boomers apart from other generational groups is the fact that &quot; almost from the time they were conceived, Boomers were dissected, analyzed, and pitched to by modern marketers, who reinforced a sense of generational distinctiveness. &quot; { Gillon, Steve (2004) Boomer Nation: The Largest and Richest Generation Ever, and How It Changed America, Free Press, &quot; Introduction &quot;, ISBN 0-7432-2947-9 } This is supported by the articles of the late 1940s identifying the increasing number of babies as an economic boom, such as in the Newsweek article of August 9, 1948, &quot; Population: Babies Mean Business &quot;, { &quot; Population: Babies Mean Business &quot;, &apos;&apos;Newsweek&apos;&apos;, August 9, 1948.

The age wave theory suggests an economic slowdown when the boomers start retiring during 2007–2009. { Economy faces bigger bust without Boomers, Reuters, Jan 31, 2008 } Baby Boomers control over 80% of personal financial assets and more than 50% of discretionary spending power. They are responsible for more than half of all consumer spending, buy 77% of all prescription drugs, 61% of OTC medication and 80% of all leisure travel. [ February 2012 ] [ Cultural identity ] Boomers grew up at a time of dramatic social change. In the United States, that social change marked the generation with a strong cultural cleavage, between the proponents of social change and the more conservative. Some analysts believe this cleavage played out politically since the time of the Vietnam War to the mid-2000s, to some extent defining the political landscape and division in the country.

Broder January 21, 2007 March 31, 2010 ] In 1993, Time magazine reported on the religious affiliations of baby boomers. Citing Wade Clark Roof, a sociologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the articles stated that about 42% of baby boomers were dropouts from formal religion, a third had never strayed from church, and one-fourth of boomers were returning to religious practice. The boomers returning to religion were &quot; usually less tied to tradition and less dependable as church members than the loyalists. They are also more liberal, which deepens rifts over issues like abortion and homosexuality. &quot; { Ostling, Richard N., &quot; The Church Search &quot;, 5 April 1993 Time article retrieved 2007-01-27 } It is jokingly said that, whatever year they were born, boomers were coming of age at the same time across the world; so that Britain was undergoing Beatlemania while people in the United States were driving over to Woodstock, organizing against the Vietnam War, or fighting and dying in the same war; boomers in Italy were dressing in mod clothes and &quot; buying the world a Coke &quot;; boomers in India were seeking new philosophical discoveries; [ April 2012 ] American boomers in Canada had just found a new home and escaped the draft; Canadian Boomers were organizing support for Pierre Trudeau. It is precisely because of these experiences that many believe those born in the second half of the birth boom belong to another generation, as events that defined their coming of age have little in common with leading or core boomers. The baby boomers found that their music, most notably rock and roll, was another expression of their generational identity. Transistor radio s were personal devices that allowed teenagers to listen to The Beatles and The Motown Sound. The Baby Boomers were the first generation, at least in Western countries, to grow up with television; some of the most popular shows during the Boomer era were The Brady Bunch, Gilligan&apos;s Island, The Twilight Zone, The Ed Sullivan Show and Happy Days. In the 1985 study of US generational cohorts by Schuman and Scott, a broad sample of adults was asked, &quot; What world events over the past 50 years were especially important to them? &quot; { Schuman, H. and Scott, J. (1989), Generations and collective memories, American Sociological Review, vol. 54 (3), 1989, pp. 359-81. } For the baby boomers the results were: Memorable events: the Cuban Missile Crisis, assassinations of JFK, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr., political unrest, walk on the moon, risk of the draft into the Vietnam War, anti-war protests, social experimentation, sexual freedom, drug experimentation, civil rights movement, environmental movement, women&apos;s movement, protests and riots, Woodstock.

As Claire Raines points out in ‘Beyond Generation X’, “never before in history had youth been so idealized as they were at this moment.” When Generation X came along it had much to live up to and to some degree in the shadow of the Boomers, sometimes compared and/or criticized (‘spoiled’, ‘whiners’ and ‘the doom generation’) than not. { 1997, Beyond generation X, Crisp Publications, USA. } One of the contributions made by the Boomer generation appears to be the expansion of individual freedom. Boomers often are associated with the civil rights movement, the feminist cause in the 1970s, gay rights, handicapped rights, and the right to privacy.
