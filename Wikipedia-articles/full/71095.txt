The four Canadian Atlantic provinces. Atlantic Canada is the region of Canada comprising the four provinces located on the Atlantic coast, excluding Quebec : the three Maritime provinces – New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia – and Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2011, was 2,327,638.

He believed it would be presumptuous for Newfoundland and Labrador to assume that it could include itself within the existing term &quot; Maritime Provinces &quot;, used to describe the cultural similarities shared by New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. The three Maritime provinces joined Confederation in the nineteenth century: New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in 1867 and Prince Edward Island in 1873.
