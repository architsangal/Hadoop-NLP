The Old Turkic script (also known as variously Göktürk script, Orkhon script, Orkhon-Yenisey script) is the alphabet used by the Göktürk and other early Turkic Khanates during the 8th to 10th centuries to record the Old Turkic language. { Scharlipp, Wolfgang (2000). An Introduction to the Old Turkish Runic Inscriptions. Verlag auf dem Ruffel., Engelschoff. ISBN 3-933847-00-X } [ Check digit (X) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] {. } It was mostly replaced by the Arabic script  after the adoption of Islam  in Volga Bulgaria (922) and Transoxania. The script is named after the Orkhon Valley in Mongolia, where early 8th century inscriptions were discovered in an 1889 expedition by Nikolay Yadrintsev. [ Sinor Denis Old Turkic History of Civilizations of Central Asia 4 331–333 UNESCO Publishing Paris 2002 ] These Orkhon inscriptions ( [ Orhun Yazıtları ] ) were published by Vasily Radlov and deciphered by the Danish philologist Vilhelm Thomsen in 1893. It was later used by the Uyghur Empire. Additionally, a Yenisei variant is known from 9th-century Kyrgyz inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and the Old Hungarian script of the 10th century. The alphabet was usually written from right to left. Further Turkic Nestorian manuscripts, that have the same &quot; rune-like &quot; duct { Georg Stadtmüller, Saeculum, Band 1, K. Alber Publishing, 1950, p.302 } as the Old Turkic script, have been found especially in the oasis of Turfan and in the fortress of Miran. { Ural-Altaic Yearbooks, Volumes 42-43, O. Harrassowitz Publishing, 1970, p.180 } { Volker Adam, Jens Peter Loud, Andrew White, Bibliography old Turkish Studies, Otto Harrassowitz Publishing, 2000, p.40 } { University of Bonn. Department of Linguistics and Cultural Studies of Central Asia, Issue 37, VGH Wissenschaftsverlag GmbH Publishing, 2008, p.107 } Thomsen described the script as &quot; Turkish runes &quot;, and it is still occasionally described as &quot; runic &quot; or &quot; runiform &quot; by comparison to the Old Germanic alphabet used for epigraphy during roughly the same period. [ Origins ] Mainstream opinion derives the Orkhon script from variants of the Aramaic alphabet, in particular via the Pahlavi and Sogdian alphabet s, as suggested by V.Thomsen, or possibly via Karosthi (cf., Issyk inscription ). Alternative possibilities include derivation from tamgas, suggested by W. Thomsen in 1893, from the Chinese script. Turkish inscriptions dated earlier than the Orkhon inscriptions used about 150 symbols, which may suggest tamgas at first imitating the Chinese script and then gradually refined into an alphabet. Thomsen (1893) connected the script to the reports of Chinese account ( Shiji, vol. 110 ) from a 2nd century BC Chinese Yan renegade and dignitary named Zhonghang Yue ( [ 中行说 ] ) who [ 牍 no ] &quot; taught the Shanyu (rulers of the Xiongnu ) to write official letters to the Chinese court on a wooden tablet ( ) 31 cm long, and to use a seal and large-sized folder &quot;. The same sources tell that when the Xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message, they made cuts on a piece of wood (ko-mu), and they also mention a &quot; Hu script &quot;. At Noin-Ula and other Hun burial sites in Mongolia and region north of Lake Baikal, the artifacts displayed over twenty carved characters. Most of these characters are either identical or very similar to the letters of the Turkic Orkhon script. { N. Ishjatms, &quot; Nomads In Eastern Central Asia &quot;, in the &quot; History of civilizations of Central Asia &quot;, Volume 2, Fig 6, p. 166, UNESCO Publishing, 1996, p.165 } [ Corpus ] The inscription corpus consists of two monuments which were erected in the Orkhon Valley between 732 and 735 in honour of the two Kokturk prince Kul Tigin and his brother the emperor Bilge Kağan, as well as inscriptions on slabs scattered in the wider area. The website of the Language Committee of Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan lists 54 inscriptions from the Orkhon area, 106 from the Yenisei area and 15 from the Talas area, and 78 from the Altai area. There are also a handful of short inscriptions found on archaeological artefacts, including a number of bronze mirrors. The Orkhon monuments are the oldest known examples of Turkic writing; they are inscribed on obelisk s and have been dated to 732 (for that relating to Kültigin ), and to 735 (for that relating to Bilge Kağan. The Tonyukuk inscription, a monument situated somewhat further east, is slightly earlier, dating to c. 722. Other inscriptions using the same script are found in Mongolia, Siberia, and Xinjiang. They relate in epic language the legendary origins of the Turks, the golden age of their history, their subjugation by the Chinese, and their liberation by Bilge. [ Table of characters ] Table of characters as published by Thomsen (1893) Old Turkic being a synharmonic language, a number of consonant signs are divided into two &quot; synharmonic sets &quot;, one for front vowels and the other for back vowels. Such vowels can be taken as intrinsic to the consonant sign, giving the Old Turkic alphabet an aspect of an abugida  script.In these cases, it is customary to use superscript numerals ¹ and ² to mark consonant signs used with back and front vowels, respectively. This convention was introduced by Thomsen (1893), and followed by Gabain (1941), Malov (1951) and Tekin (1968).

The preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries. These alphabets are divided into four groups by Kyzlasov (1994) { Kyzlasov I.L.; “Writings Of Eurasian Steppes”, Eastern Literature &quot;, Moscow, 1994, 327 pp. 321-323 } Asiatic group (includes Orkhon proper) Eurasia tic group Southern Europe group The Asiatic group is further divided into three related alphabets: Talas alphabet, a derivative of the Yenisei alphabet, Kangly or Karluks 8th to 10th centuries. Talas inscriptions include Terek-Say rock inscriptions found in the 1897, Koysary text, Bakaiyr gorge inscriptions, Kalbak-Tash 6 and 12 inscriptions, Talas alphabet has 29 identified letters. Kyzlasov I.L.; “Writings Of Eurasian Steppes”, Eastern Literature &quot;, Moscow, 1994, pp. 98-100 The Eurasia tic group is further divided into five related alphabets: Achiktash, used in Sogdiana 8th to 10th centuries South-Yenisei, used by the Göktürk 8th to 10th centuries AD two especially similar alphabets: the Don alphabet, used by the Khazar Khaganate, 8th to 10th centuries; and the Kuban alphabet, used by the Bulgars, 8th to 13th centuries. Inscriptions in both alphabets are found in the Pontic steppe and on the banks of the Kama river Tisza, used by the Badjanaks (Pechenegs) 8th to 10th centuries A number of alphabets are incompletely collected due to the limitations of the extant inscriptions. Evidence in the study of the Turkic scripts includes Turkic-Chinese bilingual inscriptions, contemporaneous Turkic inscriptions in the Greek alphabet, literal translations into Slavic language, and paper fragments with Türkic cursive writing from religion, Manichaeism, Buddhist, and legal subjects of the 8th to 10th centuries found in Xinjiang.
