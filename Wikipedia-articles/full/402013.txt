[ Lineage servers shutting down in the West http://www.gamespot.com/news/6313217.html?part%3Drss%26amp%3Btag%3Dgs_news%26amp%3Bsubj%3D6313217 12 May 2011 12 May 2011 ] [ Gameplay ] Lineage&apos;s stat, monster, and item system was originally largely borrowed from NetHack with MMO elements added. Players can choose one of seven character class es : Elf, Dark Elf, Knight, Prince, Magician, Dragon Knight, or Illusionist. Princes are the only class that can lead a blood pledge (which is Lineage&apos;s term for a guild or clan). Game play is based primarily upon a castle siege system which allows castle owners to set tax rates in neighboring cities and collect taxes on items purchased in stores within those cities. It features classic RPG elements reminiscent of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, such as killing monsters and completing quests for loot and experience points, levels, character attributes (charisma, strength, wisdom, etc.), and alignments (neutral, chaotic or lawful). A character&apos;s alignment affects how monsters and town guards react to the player&apos;s character, often turning hostile to chaotic players and attacking on sight. Player versus player combat (also known as PVP) is extensive in Lineage. Players can engage in combat with other player character s at any time as long as they are not in safe zones such as cities. By joining a &quot; bloodpledge &quot; (an association of players almost like a clan in other games) players become eligible to engage in castle sieges or wars between bloodpledges. [ Subscription history ] NCsoft has reported that Lineage had at one point more than three million subscribers, { MMOGChart Subscribers } most of them in Korea. The magnitude of the number Korean subscribers compared to other countries has sparked a number of theories. A ban on some Japan ese imports until 1998 has been cited for delayed growth in its video game console market. As of April 2008, Lineage had a little under 1 million active subscriptions. { 1Q FY2007 Earnings Release(Consolidated) } By way of comparison, World of Warcraft had substantially more active subscriptions, with over 11.5 million. On the 11th of May 2011, NC Interactive, the subsidiary of NCSoft in the United States announced it would shut down the Lineage servers (3 at that time) because of poor subscription revenues. Various events were scheduled to take place in the weeks remaining. Players were given free subscriptions to other NCSoft titles of their choice. As of June 29, 2011, Lineage has shut down all servers in NA, permanently. They said they want to focus on the Asian market, leaving it open. [ Origin of &quot; Lineage &quot; ] The title Lineage came from a series of comic book s with same title Lineage by Shin Il-sook, and the servers of Lineage are named after the characters of the comic book. It is a fantasy story where a rightful prince reclaims the throne from the hands of a usurper. When first created, the game closely resembled the original work. As developers have added new features, however, the fictional universe s of the two works have gradually diverged.
