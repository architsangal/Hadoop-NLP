[ Biography ] { funeral of Pope John Paul II. } Prince Albert was born in Stuyvenberg Castle, Brussels. On 10 May 1940, at the time when Belgium was being invaded, Prince Albert, his elder sister Princess Joséphine-Charlotte and his elder brother Prince Baudouin, left the country for France and later Spain. The Prince and the Princess returned to Belgium on 2 August 1940. They continued their studies until 1944, either at Laeken, or at the Chateau of Ciergnon in the Ardennes. In June 1944, at the time of the Allied landings, King Leopold III, Princess Lilian – whom he married in 1941 – and the royal children were deported by the Germans to Hirschstein, Germany, and later to Strobl, Austria, where they were liberated by the American Army on 7 May 1945. Villa Le Reposoir in Switzerland where the family lived in the late 1940s Due to the political situation in Belgium, King Leopold and his family moved to the villa &quot; Le Reposoir &quot; in Pregny, Switzerland, when they left Austria in October 1945 and stayed until July 1950. During that time, Prince Albert would continue his education in a secondary school in Geneva. King Leopold III, accompanied by Prince Baudouin and Prince Albert, returned to Belgium on 22 July 1950. He is the 1,292nd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria and the 1,191st Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Spain in 1994. [ Marriage and family ] { George W. Bush and First Lady } { Laura Bush at the Royal Palace in } { Brussels in 2005. } In 1958, Prince Albert of Liege went to the Vatican to witness the inauguration of Pope John XXIII. At a reception at the Belgian embassy, the prince met Italian Princess Paola Ruffo di Calabria. “We were both shy, so we only talked a little,” Paola said later about their first meeting. Shy but smitten, Prince Albert proposed marriage to Paola, and she accepted. Two months after their meeting, the Prince introduced his future wife to his family, and four months later to the press. Upon arriving in Brussels for the first time before her wedding, Princess Paola won over the Belgian media immediately. &quot; The charm and beauty of the blond princess from the south quickly captured the hearts of the Belgians &quot;, wrote the newspapers back then. They wanted a marriage at the Vatican at first, a setting promoted by both families, but the Belgian government did not approve of that. They did not want to keep a fairy tale wedding from the people of Belgium, who finally had an opportunity for organizing celebrations for their Royals Family. The Pope, after some diplomatic pressure, refused them a marriage at the Vatican, saying he would understand if the couple would want to get married amidst their people. On 2 July 1959 he married Princess Paola Ruffo di Calabria (born 11 September 1937) in Brussels. She is the daughter of Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda and his wife, Countess Luisa Gazelli di Rossana e di Sebastiano (1896–1989). Together they have three children, two sons and a daughter: HRH Princess Elisabeth of Belgium (born 25 October 2001), who will inherit the throne after her father.

However his son Prince Philippe was groomed to be Baudoin&apos;s successor, once it became clear that the King would have no children to succeed him. However, on Baudouin&apos;s death (at age 62), Albert was sworn in before parliament on 9 August 1993 as the sixth King of the Belgians. { http://www.monarchie.be/royal-family/king-albert-ii } As King, Albert&apos;s duties include representing Belgium at home and abroad on state visits, trade missions, and at high level international meetings as well as taking an interest in Belgian society, culture and enterprise. { http://www.monarchie.be/monarchy-today } In 1984, he set up the Prince Albert Foundation, to promote expertise in foreign trade. { http://www.monarchie.be/monarchy-today/royal-initiatives/prince-albert-fund } The King has a constitutional role which came into play in 2010-2011 when Belgium&apos;s parliament was unable to agree on a government. When the crisis was resolved, Albert swore in the new government. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16042750 BBC News Belgium swears in new government headed by Elio Di Rupo 6 December 2011 ] In January 2012, Albert announced that the royal family would freeze their allowances and use a greater proportion of their income to maintain the royal palaces.

Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations – which means that if Albert II were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Wettin, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.
