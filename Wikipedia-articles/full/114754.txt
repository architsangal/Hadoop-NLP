As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,367. [ History ] Cherryvale was founded on the land of the Osage Indians who were pushed out by veterans of the American Civil War looking for land. The first white man to purchase property and settle here was Mr. Abe Eaton, who later sold it to the Kansas City, Lawrence &amp; Southern Kansas Railroad which then became the Leavenworth, Lawrence &amp; Galveston Railway. The town site was platted by the railroad in May 1871, at a time in which the 1870 U.S. Census had already reported 435 pioneering men, women and children taking up residence on a location named for its beautiful spring cherry blossoms. [ February 2012 ] From 1871-1873, the Bender family, later called the Bloody Benders, set up a small general store and inn about [ 7 mi km ] northeast and killed at least 12 travellers including one child. While the Benders hold a tragic and morbid story, these serial killer s are famous in the area. In late 1903, Cherryvale was deeply affected by the death of its city marshal, William G. Jones, who was shot while attempting to serve an arrest warrant to a local resident. [ February 2012 ] The town grew rapidly as a railroad hub, becoming a leader in zinc mining, glass and brick production. The Edgar Zinc Company was once the world&apos;s largest zinc smeltering facility. By 1920, 4,698 people called Cherryvale home, and in 1925 the community featured 20 groceries, 10 restaurants, 2 theatres (the Liberty Theatre and the Royal Theatre), 11 churches, and a &quot; Cherryvale Business College. &quot; There were also six brick plants that used the abundant natural gas of the area to fuel their kilns cheaply. [ February 2012 ] Cherryvale once lay on the 90-mile route of the electric interurbans run by the Union Traction Company, with trolley tracks occupying the center of Main Street until 1947. Local boys during the 1930s liked to &quot; soap &quot; the trolley rails as a prank, halting the progress of interurban cars until a motorman climbed down and applied sand. [ February 2012 ] By 1940, the local brickyards had ceased production, and population declined to 3,185 inhabitants. Since the 1970s- with the loss of light manufacturing firms- the number of the town&apos;s residents has dwindled further. [ February 2012 ] The high school ball teams were renamed the &quot; Cherryvale Chargers &quot; because the original team name-- &quot; The Fighting Cherries &quot; -- conjured up images of a soft, sweet nature that did not inspire sufficient respect. Today the cherry trees of frontier Cherryvale exist only in local lore. [ February 2012 ] The city is currently the headquarters for the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad, a shortline that runs 511 miles of track in Kansas and Oklahoma.
