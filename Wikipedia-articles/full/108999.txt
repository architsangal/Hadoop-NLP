The name &quot; Merritt Island &quot; also refers to the extent of the former island, which is now a peninsula. Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and NASA &apos;s John F. Kennedy Space Center are located on the northern part of Merritt Island. The southern area is heavily residential, with centralized light commercial and light industrial areas. The island does not belong to any official city. The central part of Merritt Island, previously known as Merritt City, [ Parrish, Field, Harrell Images of America, Merritt Island and Cocoa Beach Arcadia Publishing 2001 123 978-0-7385-0668-5 ] is home to the majority of the population and includes the local high school, library, and shopping district. [ History ] [ Etymology ] Merritt Island owes its name to the king of Spain. The entire island was part of a land grant given by the king to a nobleman named Merritt.

The Indian River oranges and grapefruit come from this sandy area. The island&apos;s population grew in the 1950s and 1960s as the Space Race began and nearby NASA expanded. Construction of a barge canal to the Intracoastal Waterway from the Atlantic Ocean (for power plant oil shipments) cut off the northern half of the island for many years. To this day, the northern portion of the island remains slightly less developed, with a few areas remaining as cattle pasture or citrus land. The small towns on the island vanished with the coming of the Space Age, and now only live on in the names of streets and historic churches. In 1988, citizens defeated a proposed incorporation into a city, 77% opposed to 23% in favor.

[ http://factfinder2.census.gov Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Merritt Island CDP, Florida U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder January 31, 2012 ] Merritt Island is an island. The construction of the Crawlerway in the north (for NASA space vehicles to move to the launch pad over Banana Creek ) connected Merritt Island to a mainland peninsula. To the west and south it is separated by the Indian River Lagoon and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. The east side of Merritt Island splits and is divided by Sykes Creek and Newfound Harbor. They, in turn, are separated by the Banana River Lagoon from Cocoa Beach, Florida. To the north, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, along with a narrow barrier island that make up Canaveral National Seashore, offer an unpopulated protected buffer area for space shuttle launches at Kennedy Space Center. Migratory birds join the more resident wildlife, including alligators, manatee s, dolphin s, sea turtles, bald eagle s, osprey s, bobcat s, and the elusive Florida panther. A number of bald eagle nests are monitored atop power line poles along SR 3 within Kennedy Space Center. To the west, the island is connected by causeways to mainland Brevard County near Titusville and Cocoa on its northern end, and in Melbourne on its southern end.
