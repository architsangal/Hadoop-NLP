Below is a timeline of the telephone that covers many important dates in the history of the telephone. [ History of telephony ] [ 1844 to 1875 ] Innocenzo Manzetti Antonio Meucci Charles Bourseul Johann Philipp Reis Elisha gray Thomas Edison Alexander Graham Bell Thomas Augustus Watson Tivadar Puskás Emile Berliner Charles Sumner Tainter Theodore Newton Vail 1844: Innocenzo Manzetti The first mooted the idea of a “speaking telegraph” (telephone). 1849: Antonio Meucci demonstrates a communicating device to individuals in Havana. It is disputed if this is an electromagnetic telephone, but is said to involve direct transmission of electricity into the user&apos;s body. 1854: Charles Bourseul publishes a description of a make-break telephone transmitter and receiver in L&apos;Illustration, (Paris) but does not construct a working instrument 1854: Antonio Meucci demonstrates an electric voice operated device in New York, but it is not clear what kind of device he demonstrated. 1860: Johann Philipp Reis of Germany demonstrates a make-break transmitter after the design of Bourseul and a knitting needle receiver. Witnesses said they heard human voices being transmitted. 1861: Johann Philipp Reis manages to transfer voice electrically over a distance of 340 feet, see Reis&apos; telephone. Reis used his Telephone (the word also invented by Reis) to transmit his phrase &quot; The horse does not eat cucumber salad &quot;. This phrase in German is hard to understand acoustically so Reis used it to prove if speech can be recognized on another side successfully. 1864: in an attempt to give his musical automaton a voice, Innocenzo Manzetti invents the &apos;Speaking telegraph&apos;. He shows no interest in patenting his device, but it is reported in newspapers. 1865: Meucci reads of Manzetti&apos;s invention and writes to the editors of two newspapers claiming priority and quoting his first experiment in 1849. He writes &quot; I do not wish to deny Mr. Manzetti his invention, I only wish to observe that two thoughts could be found to contain the same discovery, and that by uniting the two ideas one can more easily reach the certainty about a thing this important. &quot; If he reads Meucci&apos;s offer of collaboration, Manzetti does not respond. 1871: Antonio Meucci files a patent caveat (a statement of intention to patent) Text of Meucci&apos;s Caveat, pages 16-18 for a Sound Telegraph, but it does not describe an electromagnetic telephone. 1872: Elisha Gray founded Western Electric Manufacturing Company. 1872: Professor Vanderwyde demonstrated Reis&apos;s telephone in New York. July 1873: Thomas Edison notes variable resistance in carbon grains due to pressure, builds a rheostat based on the principle but abandons it because of its sensitivity to vibration. May 1874: Gray invents electromagnet device for transmitting musical tones. Some of his receivers use a metallic diaphragm. 29 December 1874: Gray demonstrates his musical tones device and transmitted &quot; familiar melodies through telegraph wire &quot; at the Presbyterian Church in Highland Park, Illinois. 2 June 1875: Alexander Graham Bell transmits the sound of a plucked steel reed using electromagnet instruments. 1 July 1875: Bell uses a bi-directional &quot; gallows &quot; telephone that was able to transmit &quot; indistinct but voicelike sounds &quot; but not clear speech. Both the transmitter and the receiver were identical membrane electromagnet instruments. 1875: Thomas Edison experiments with acoustic telegraphy and in November builds an electro-dynamic receiver but does not exploit it.

The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1931 - 1954) Adelaide, SA 21 June 1933 16 April 2012 5 National Library of Australia ] 11 February 1876: Elisha Gray invents liquid transmitter for use with a telephone, but does not build one. 14 February 1876: (about 9:30am) Gray or his lawyer brings to the Washington, D.C. patent office Gray&apos;s caveat for the telephone. (A caveat was like a patent application without request for examination to notify the patent office of an invention in process.) 14 February 1876: (about 11:30am) Bell&apos;s lawyer brings to the same patent office Bell&apos;s patent application for the telephone. Bell&apos;s lawyer requested that it be registered immediately in the cash receipts blotter. 14 February 1876: (about 1:30pm) Approximately two hours later Elisha Gray&apos;s caveat was registered in the cash blotter. Although his caveat was not a full application, Gray could have converted it into a patent application, but did not do so because of advice from his lawyer and his involvement with acoustic telegraphy. The result was that the patent was awarded to Bell. Hounshell, David A. 1975. Elisha Gray and the Telephone: On the Disadvantages of Being an Expert. Technology and Culture 16 (2):133-161. 7 March 1876: Bell&apos;s US patent No. 174,465 for the telephone is granted. 10 March 1876: Bell transmits speech &quot; Mr. Watson, come here!

April 1877: A telephone line connects the workshop of Charles Williams, Jr., located in Boston, to his house in Somerville, Massachusetts at 109 Court Street in Boston, where Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson had previously experimented with their telephone.
