The land was unsuitable for crops, but the heavily forested surroundings were useful for logging. The Canadian military acquired land in the area in 1905, which later became Canadian Forces Base Petawawa. During this period it was used as an internment camp for German POW s during World War II. Later, it became home to the Canadian Airborne Regiment before it was disbanded in 1995. Today, it is one of Canada&apos;s largest ground forces bases with members deployed throughout the world on various missions supporting the United Nations in peacekeeping or the War on Terror. Petawawa was incorporated as a township in 1865. In 1961, the urban area of Petawawa was incorporated as a separate village. On July 1, 1997, the village and township re- amalgamated to form the Town of Petawawa.
