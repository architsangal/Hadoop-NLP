[ ] Neptunium ( [ icon n ɛ p ˈ tj uː n i ə m ] [ nep TEW nee-əm ] ) is a chemical element with the symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive metal, neptunium is the first transuranic element and belongs to the actinide series. Its most stable isotope, 237 Np, is a by-product of nuclear reactor s and plutonium production and it can be used as a component in neutron detection equipment. Neptunium is also found in trace amounts in uranium ores due to transmutation reactions. [ C. R. Hammond The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition CRC press 0-8493-0485-7 2004 ] [ History ] The periodic table of Dmitri Mendeleev published in the 1870s showed a &quot; — &quot; in place after uranium similar to several other places for at that point undiscovered elements. Also a publication of the known radioactive isotopes by Kasimir Fajans shows the empty place after uranium. [ Fajans Kasimir Die radioaktiven Umwandlungen und das periodische System der Elemente Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft 46 422 1913 10.1002/cber.19130460162 ] At least three times, discoveries of the element 93 were falsely reported, as bohemium and ausonium in 1934 and then sequanium in 1939. The name neptunium has previously been considered for other elements. The search for element 93 in minerals was encumbered by the fact that the predictions on the chemical properties of element 93 were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinides series and therefore placed thorium below hafnium, protactinium below tantalum and uranium below tungsten. This periodic table suggested that element 93, at that point often named eka-rhenium, should be similar to manganese or rhenium. With this misconception it was impossible to isolate element 93 from minerals although later neptunium was found in uranium ore in 1952. [ Peppard D. F. Mason G. W. Gray P. R. Mech J. F. Journal of the American Chemical Society 74 6081 1952 10.1021/ja01143a074 23 ] Enrico Fermi believed that bombarding uranium with neutrons and subsequent beta decay would lead to the formation of element 93. Chemical separation of the new formed elements from the uranium yielded material with low half-life and therefore Fermi announced the discovery of a new element in 1934, [ 10.1038/133898a0 Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92 1934 Fermi, E. Nature 133 898 1934Natur.133..898F 3372 ] though this was soon found to be mistaken. Soon it was speculated [ Ida Noddack Ida Noddack 1934 653 Über das Element 93 47 Zeitschrift für Angewandte Chemie http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Noddack-1934.html 10.1002/ange.19340473707 37 ] and later proven [ Meitner Lise Frisch O.

Small quantities of neptunium had to be produced in Otto Hahn &apos;s experiments in late 1930s as a result of decay of 239 U. Hahn and his colleagues experimentally confirmed production and chemical properties of 239 U, but were unsuccessful at isolating and detecting neptunium. [ http://www.crownedanarchist.com/emc2/discovery_of_fission.doc Discovery of fission Otto Hahn Scientific American 1958 ] Neptunium (named for the planet Neptune, the next planet out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was discovered by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced the neptunium isotope 239 Np (2.4 day half-life ) by bombarding uranium with slow moving neutrons. It was the first transuranium element produced synthetically and the first actinide series transuranium element discovered.

Artificial 237 Np is produced through the reduction of 237 NpF 3 with barium or lithium vapor at around 1200 ° C and is most often extracted from spent nuclear fuel rod s as a by-product in plutonium production. [ NpF 3 ] [ BaF 2 ] 2 + 3 Ba → 2 Np + 3 By weight, neptunium-237 discharges are about 5% as great as plutonium discharges and about 0.05% of spent nuclear fuel discharges.

It is the densest element of all actinoids. [ Isotopes ] [ isotopes of neptunium ] 19 neptunium radioisotope s have been characterized, with the most stable being 237 Np with a half-life of 2.14 million years, 236 Np with a half-life of 154,000 years, and 235 Np with a half-life of 396.1 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 4.5 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 50 minutes. This element also has 4 meta state s, with the most stable being 236m Np (t ½ 22.5 hours). The isotopes of neptunium range in atomic weight from 225.0339 u ( 225 Np) to 244.068 u ( 244 Np). The primary decay mode before the most stable isotope, 237 Np, is electron capture (with a good deal of alpha emission ), and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay product s before 237 Np are element 92 ( uranium ) isotopes (alpha emission produces element 91, protactinium, however) and the primary products after are element 94 ( plutonium ) isotopes. 237 Np is fissionable. 237 Np eventually decays to form bismuth -209 and thallium -205, unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay to make isotopes of lead. This decay chain is known as the neptunium series. [ Synthesis ] Chemically, neptunium is prepared by the reduction of NpF 3 with barium or lithium vapor at about 1200 °C. Most Np is produced in nuclear reactions: When an 235 U atom captures a neutron, it is converted to an excited state of 236 U. About 81% of the excited 236 U nuclei undergo fission, but the remainder decay to the ground state of 236 U by emitting gamma radiation. Further neutron capture creates 237 U which has a half-life of 7 days and thus quickly decays to 237 Np through beta decay. During beta decay, the excited 237 U emits an electron, while the atomic weak interaction converts a neutron to a proton, thus creating 237 Np. \mathrm{^{235}_{\ 92}U\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ \longrightarrow \ ^{236}_{\ 92}U_m\ \xrightarrow[120 \ ns]{} \ ^{236}_{\ 92}U\ +\ \gamma} \mathrm{^{236}_{\ 92}U\ +\ ^{1}_{0}n\ \longrightarrow \ ^{237}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow[6.75 \ d]{\beta^-} \ ^{237}_{\ 93}Np} 237 U is also produced via an ( n,2n) reaction with 238 U. This only happens with very energetic neutrons. 237 Np is the product of alpha decay of 241 Am. Heavier isotopes of neptunium decay quickly, and lighter isotopes of neptunium cannot be produced by neutron capture, so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure 237 Np.

Neptunium hexafluoride, NpF 6, is volatile like uranium hexafluoride. [ fluoride volatility uranium enrichment ] Neptunium, like protactinium, uranium, plutonium, and americium readily forms a linear dioxo neptunyl core (NpO 2 n+ ), in its 5+ and 6+ oxidation states, which readily complexes with hard O-donor ligands such as OH –, NO 2 –, NO 3 –, and SO 4 2– to form soluble anionic complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil.

[ Weapons applications ] Neptunium is fissionable, and could theoretically be used as fuel in a fast neutron reactor or a nuclear weapon. In 1992, the U.S. Department of Energy declassified the statement that neptunium-237 &quot; can be used for a nuclear explosive device &quot;. { &quot; Restricted Data Declassification Decisions from 1946 until Present &quot;, accessed Sept 23, 2006 } It is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using neptunium. As of 2009, the world production of neptunium-237 by commercial power reactors was over 1000 critical masses a year, but to extract the isotope from irradiated fuel elements would be a major industrial undertaking. In September 2002, researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory briefly created the first known nuclear critical mass using neptunium in combination with shells of enriched uranium ( U-235 ), discovering that the critical mass of a bare sphere of neptunium-237 &quot; ranges from kilogram weights in the high fifties to low sixties, &quot; showing that it &quot; is about as good a bomb material as U-235. &quot; [ Weiss P.

With a half-life of 432 years, the americium-241 in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 20 years, and about 15% after 100 years. Due to its long half-life neptunium becomes the major contributor of the total radiation in 10,000 years. As it is unclear what happens to the containment in that long time span, an extraction of the neptunium would minimize the contamination of the environment if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years.
