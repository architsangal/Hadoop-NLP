[ Allen G. R. Midgley S. H. Allen M. Field Guide to the Freshwater Fishes of Australia 2002 Western Australia Museum 0-7307-5486-3 Perth 56–58 ] In this family of fish, the head is bony and the elongate body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and the anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name &quot; bonytongues &quot; is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the &quot; tongue &quot;, equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The fish can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into the swim bladder, which is lined with capillaries like lung tissue. The arowana is an &quot; obligatory air breather &quot;. [ Berra Tim M. 2001 Freshwater Fish Distribution San Diego Academic Press 0-12-093156-7 ] [ Habitat ] Osteoglossids are basal (primitive) fish from the lower Tertiary and are placed in the actinopterygii d order Osteoglossiformes. There are ten described living species : three from South America, one from Africa, four from Asia, and the remaining two from Australia. Osteoglossidae is the only exclusively freshwater fish family found on both sides of the Wallace Line. [ Ismail, Mohd Zakaria Systematics, Zoogeography, and Conservation of the Freshwater Fishes of Peninsular Malaysia Colorado State University 1989 doctoral dissertation 25 ] This may be explained by the theory that Asian arowana s (S. formosus) diverged from the Australian Scleropages, S. jardinii and S. leichardti, about 140 million years ago, making it likely that Asian arowanas were carried to Asia on the Indian subcontinent.

They are excellent jumpers; it has been reported that Osteoglossum species have been seen leaping more than 6 feet (almost 2 metres) from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname &quot; water monkeys &quot;. Arowana species typically grow to around 2 to 3 feet in captivity. Several species of osteoglossid exhibit extensive parental care. They build nests and protect the young after they hatch. All species are mouthbrooder s, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent&apos;s mouth to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently. [ In the aquarium ] Arowanas are solitary fish and only appreciate company while young; adults may show excessive dominance and aggression. Some compatible fish often partnered with this fish are clown knifefish, pacu, oscars, plecostomus, jaguar cichlid s, green terror s, gar, siamese tigerfish (datnioides microlepis) and any other semi-aggressive fish that cannot fit in the arowana&apos;s mouth. These fishes are best kept with live or frozen feed and they easily outgrow the tank within a span of 8–10 months. Always preferred in a large type aquarium of at least 150 gallons.

Species are given with one or more prominent common names.

A genetic study shows that the lineage leading to the arapaima and African arowana diverged about 220 million years ago, during the Late Triassic; the lineage leading to the silver and blackish blue arowanas of South America diverged about 170 million years ago, during the Middle Jurassic. The lineage leading to the Australian arowanas diverged from that leading to the Asian arowanas about 140 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous. [ Fossil record ] At least five extinct genera, known only from fossils, are classified as Osteoglossids; these date back at least as far as the Late Cretaceous. Other fossils from as far back as the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous are widely considered to belong to the arowana superorder Osteoglossomorpha. Osteoglossomorph fossils have been found on all continents except Antarctica. [ Guo-Qing Li Wilson, Mark V. H. 1998 http://tolweb.org/tree?group%3DOsteoglossomorpha%26amp%3Bcontgroup%3DTeleostei Osteoglossomorpha article Tree of Life 2006-04-14 ] These fossil genera include Brychaetus, Joffrichthys, and Phareodus. [ Etymology ] The fish name came from the native Indonesian language that means ARWANA or NIRWANA, meaning fish of paradise.
