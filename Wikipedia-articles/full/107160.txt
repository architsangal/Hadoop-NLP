[ 6 ] The community had a population of 3,868 at the 2000 census. Prescott is part of the Hope Micropolitan Statistical Area. Located 100 miles southwest of Little Rock, Prescott was constructed on the Prairie D&apos;Ane, { http://www.arkansas.com/attractions/detail.aspx?id=24660 } which consisted of approximately 25–30 square miles of rolling prairie, surrounded by forest. The area had been a well known crossroads { http://www.civilwar.n2genealogy.com/battles/640409b.html } prior to the construction of the Cairo &amp; Fulton Railroad. { http://www.depotmuseum.org/articles.php?article=56 } To the west lies the city of Washington, to the east lies the city of Camden, while to the south lies the Red River, with Shreveport, Texarkana, and Dallas beyond. As of 2011, Prescott and Nevada County had sixteen properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Elkin&apos;s Ferry Battleground and the Prairie D&apos;Ane Battlefield are further recognized as National Historic Landmark s. [ History ] The city of Prescott was platted in 1873, during construction of the Cairo &amp; Fulton Railroad. { http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2422 } The railroad was constructed paralleling the Southwest Trail { http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2305 } through northern Nevada County. Prescott was incorporated on October 6, 1874. The original town site consisted of 48 blocks, 24 on each side of the railroad. The streets were platted in a grid pattern from the railroad line. Streets running east-west use the railroad as a dividing line between their eastern and western halves, and streets running north-south use Main Street as a dividing line between their northern and southern halves. Prescott grew quickly because the railroad provided a reliable way to transport local products to larger markets. The first post office opened in November 1873, and the first newspaper, &apos;The Banner&apos;, was established in 1875. The Nevada County seat was moved to Prescott in 1877, which contributed to the town’s commercial importance. By the late 1890s, Prescott had its own telephone system and water and light plant. The timber industry had a large impact on the region’s early economy when in 1890, James H. Bemis &amp; Benjamin Whitaker built the Ozan Lumber Company plant in Prescott. That same year, Dr. R. L. Powers began constructing the Prescott &amp; Northwestern Railroad. It transported lumber, peaches, cotton and other products. It also provided passenger service, connecting adjacent communities to the Missouri Pacific Railroad Depot in Prescott. There has been a debate about how Prescott got its name, { http://www.depotmuseum.org/articles.php?article=44 } whether it was from William H. Prescott, of Salem, Massachusetts, who was a friend of Thomas Allen and Henry Marquand, (Cairo &amp; Fulton Railroad officials) or from County Surveyor, W. H. Prescott.
