It is located in the middle of a complex meteorite crater, called the Nördlinger Ries. The town was also the place of two battles during the Thirty Years&apos; War. Today it is one of only three towns in Germany that still has a completely established city wall, the other two being Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Dinkelsbühl. Another tourist feature of this mediæval town is its 90  m steeple called &quot; Daniel &quot;, being part of the Saint Georg&apos;s Church and made of an impact breccia called suevite containing shocked quartz. Other notable buildings are the town hall (13th century), St. Salvator church and the Spital, a former medieval hospital. The Ries crater museum is located in the well-preserved medieval tanner&apos;s quarter. The city is home to several other museums, such as the Bavarian Railway Museum, the Nördlingen city museum (Stadtmuseum), the city wall museum (Stadtmauermuseum) and Augenblick museum with panoramas, magic lanterns, silent films, barrel organs, pianolas, music boxes and gramophones. Nördlingen is also notable for the Scharlachrennen, a notable horse riding tournament that was first mentioned in 1463. [ History ] thumb The remains of a Roman castellum, built in the year 85 and probably called Septemiacum, have been found under the city { http://www.live-like-a-german.com/destinations/show/noerdlingen/ }. In 1998, Nördlingen celebrated its 1100-year-old history. Until the Thirty Years&apos; War and the Battle of Nördlingen (1634), Nördlingen was one of Germany&apos;s major trading towns. Nördlingen trade fair (Pfingstmesse) was first mentioned in 1219. A second battle was also fought there during the Thirty Years&apos; War. Nördlingen was one of the first Protestant cities and took part in the Protestation at Speyer in 1529. In 1604 a shortened and simplified version of William Shakespeare&apos;s Romeo and Juliet was performed in Nördlingen - this was one of the first performances of any Shakespearean play outside England. In 1802 Nördlingen ceased being a Free imperial city and became part of Bavaria.

[ Impact Diamonds ] thumb Stone buildings in the town contain millions of tiny diamonds, all less than 0.2 millimeters across. The impact that caused the Nördlinger Ries crater created an estimated 72000 tons of them when it impacted a local graphite deposit. Stone from this area was later quarried and used to build the stone buildings.
