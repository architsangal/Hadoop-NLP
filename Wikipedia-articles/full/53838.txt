[ Topography ] [ Geology of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex ] Dallas and its surrounding area are mostly flat; the city itself lies at elevations ranging from [ 450 ft m 0 ] to [ 550 ft m 0 ]. The western edge of the Austin Chalk Formation, a limestone escarpment (also known as the &quot; White Rock Escarpment &quot; ), rises [ 200 ft m 0 ] and runs roughly north-south through Dallas County. South of the Trinity River, the uplift is particularly noticeable in the neighborhoods of Oak Cliff and the adjacent cities of Cockrell Hill, Cedar Hill, Grand Prairie, and Irving. Marked variations in terrain are also found in cities immediately to the west in Tarrant County surrounding Fort Worth, as well as along Turtle Creek north of Downtown. Dallas, like many other cities in the world, was founded along a river. The city was founded at the location of a &quot; white rock crossing &quot; of the Trinity River, where it was easier for wagons to cross the river in the days before ferries or bridges. The Trinity River, though not usefully navigable, is the major waterway through the city. Its path through Dallas is paralleled by Interstate 35E along the Stemmons Corridor, then south alongside the western portion of Downtown and past south Dallas and Pleasant Grove, where the river is paralleled by Interstate 45 until it exits the city and heads southeast towards Houston. The river is flanked on both sides by [ 50 ft m 0 ] tall earthen levee s to protect the city from frequent floods. [ John N.

When only temperature itself is accounted for, the north central Texas region where Dallas is located is one of the hottest in the United States during the summer months, usually trailing only the Mojave Desert basin of Arizona, southern Nevada, and southeastern California.

A day with clear, sunny skies, a high of [ 63 °F °C 0 ], and a low of [ 36 °F °C 0 ] would thus be a very typical one during the winter. However, strong cold fronts known as &quot; Blue Northers &quot; sometimes pass through the Dallas region, plummeting nightly lows below [ 25 °F °C 0 ] for up to a few days at a time and keeping daytime highs in a struggle to surpass [ 40 °F °C 0 ]. Snow accumulation is usually seen in the city at least once every winter, and snowfall generally occurs 1–2 days out of the year for an annual average of [ 1.7 in cm ].
