[ the 1962 economic history book by Murray Rothbard The Panic of 1819 ] [ April 2011 ] The Panic of 1819 was the first major financial crisis in the United States, [ Business cycles and depressions: an encyclopedia Glasner, David; Cooley, Thomas F., eds 1997 New York Garland Publishing Crisis of 1819 Skaggs, Neil T. 124–25 0-8240-0944-4 ] and had occurred during the political calm of the Era of Good Feelings. The new nation previously had faced a depression following the war of independence in the late 1780s and led directly to the establishment of the dollar and, perhaps indirectly, to the calls for a Constitutional Convention. It had also experienced another severe economic downturn in the late 1790s following the Panic of 1797. In the earlier crises however, the primary cause of economic turmoil originated in foreign trade and the broader Atlantic economy. { Morris, Richard B. (1987) The forging of the Union, 1781-1789. } These crises and others had resulted from international conflicts such as the Embargo Act and War of 1812 and had caused widespread domestic foreclosure s, bank failure s, unemployment, and a slump in agriculture and manufacturing. However, things would change for the US economy after the Second Bank of the United States was founded in 1816, { Rothbard, Murray N. The Panic of 1819 } in response to the spread of bank notes across United States from private banks, due to inflation brought on by the debt following the war. { Second Bank of the United States/Portrait Gallery } In contrast, the causes of the Panic of 1819 largely originated within the U.S. economy. The panic marked the end of the economic expansion that had followed the War of 1812 and ushered in new financial policies that would shape economic development. [ Explanations ] Different economic schools of thought have offered explanations for the Panic of 1819. Economists who adhere to Keynesian economic theory suggest that the Panic of 1819 was the early Republic&apos;s first experience with the boom-bust cycles common to all modern economies. Clyde Haulman, Professor of Economics at the College of William and Mary, { Clyde Haulman&apos;s Homepage } argues that the Panic was partly caused by a decision to call in loans of the Second Bank of the US. Combined with the issue of the depression and overspeculation, the Panic of 1819 marked the beginning of a new phase of American economic history, where mature market institutions would continue to move cyclically from boom to bust. These explanations are not intended to discount the importance of war-time public finance as a cause of the Panic. They simply assert that the contraction of the Second Bank of the US were also to blame. [ February 2007 ] Austrian school economists view the nationwide recession that resulted from the Panic of 1819 as the first failure of expansionary monetary policy. This explanation is based on the Austrian theory of the business cycle. Government borrowed heavily to finance the War of 1812, which caused tremendous strain on the banks’ reserves of specie, leading to a suspension of specie payments in 1814, and then again during the recession of 1819-1821, violating contractual rights of depositors. { Murray N. Rothbard. } { A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II. ISBN 0-945466-33-1 } The suspension of the obligation to redeem greatly spurred the establishment of new banks and the expansion of bank note issues, and this inflation of money encouraged unsustainable investments to take place. It soon became clear the monetary situation was threatening, and the Second Bank of the United States was forced to call a halt to its expansion and launch a painful process of contraction. There was a wave of bankruptcies, bank failures, and bank runs; prices dropped and wide-scale urban unemployment began. By 1819, land measures in the U.S. had also reached [ 3500000 acre km2 ], and many Americans did not have enough money to pay off their loans. { Panic of 1819 - Ohio History Central - A product of the Ohio Historical Society } The Panic was also partially due to international events. European demand for American foodstuffs was decreased because agriculture in Europe was recovering from the Napoleonic Wars, which had decimated European agriculture. War and revolution in the New World destroyed the supply line of precious metals from Mexico and Peru to Europe. American bankers and businessmen started issuing false banknotes to quickly expand credit. American bankers, who had little experience with corporate charter s, promissory note s, bills of exchange, or stock s and bonds, encouraged the speculation boom during the first years of the market revolution. By the end of 1819, the bank would call these loans. Small, local ups and downs had occurred in the market since the 1790s, but never to this magnitude. Businesses went bankrupt when they could not meet their debts, and hundreds of thousands of wage workers lost their jobs. For example, unemployment reached 75 percent in Philadelphia, and 1,800 workers were imprisoned for debt. [ October 2008 ] In Baltimore, the unemployed set up a city of tents on the outskirts of the city. [ Proposed remedies ] Proposed remedies included: increase of tariff s (largely proposed by Northern manufacturing interests). reduction of tariffs (largely proposed by Southerners, who believed free trade would stimulate the economy and increase demand). monetary expansion; i.e., restriction or suspension of specie payment. rigid enforcement of specie payment. restriction of bank credit. direct relief of debtors. public works proposals. stricter enforcement of anti-usury laws. In the event, President Monroe, interpreting the economic crisis in the narrow monetary terms then current, limited governmental action to economizing and ensuring fiscal stability. He acquiesced in suspension of specie payments to bank depositors, setting a precedent for the Panics of 1837 &amp; 1857. Although he agreed to the need for improved transportation facilities, he refused to approve appropriations for internal improvements without prior amendment of the Constitution. Monroe would aid the economy with laws like the Land Act of 1820 and the Relief Act of 1821. { Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial: Historic Resource Study (Chapter 5) } By 1823, the panic had ended. { Digital History } [ See also ] Crisis of 1857 Business cycle Keynesian economics Monetary policy Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle List of recessions in the United States [ References ] [ 2 ] [ Further reading ] [ Cayton Andrew R.
