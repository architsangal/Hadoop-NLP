Its IUPAC name is 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane. It is the only inhalational anesthetic agent containing a bromine atom; there are several other halogenated anesthesia agents which lack the bromine atom and do contain the fluorine and chlorine atoms present in halothane. It is colorless and pleasant-smelling, but unstable in light. It is packaged in dark-colored bottles and contains 0.01% thymol as a stabilizing agent. Halothane is a core medicine in the World Health Organization &apos;s &quot; Essential Drugs List &quot;, which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic health care system. [ March 2011 http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2011/a95053_eng.pdf WHO Model List of Essential Medicines PDF World Health Organization 2011-08-22 ] Its use in developed countries, however, has been almost entirely superseded by newer inhalational anaesthetic agents. [ Anesthetic properties ] It is a potent anesthetic with a minimum alveolar concentration of 0.74. Its blood/gas partition coefficient of 2.4 makes it an agent with moderate induction and recovery time. It is not a good analgesic and its muscle relaxation effect is moderate. [ Halothane http://anesthesiageneral.com/halothane/ ] [ History ] This halogenated hydrocarbon was first synthesized by C. W. Suckling of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1951 and was first used clinically by M. Johnstone in Manchester in 1956. Halothane became popular as a nonflammable general anasthetic replacing other volatile anesthetic s such as diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Use of the anesthetic was phased out during the 1980s and 1990s as newer anesthetic agents became popular. Halothane retains some use in veterinary surgery and in the Third World because of its lower cost. Halothane was given to many millions of adult and pediatric patients worldwide from its introduction in 1956 through the 1980s. Its properties include cardiac depression at high levels, cardiac sensitization to catecholamine s such as norepinephrine, and potent bronchial relaxation. Its lack of airway irritation made it a common inhalation induction agent in pediatric anesthesia. Due to its cardiac depressive effect, it was contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. Halothane was also contraindicated in patients susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia s, or in situations related to high catecholamine levels such as pheochromocytoma. [ Side effects ] Repeated exposure to halothane in adults was noted in rare cases to result in severe liver injury. This occurred in about 1 in 10,000 exposures. The resulting syndrome was referred to as halothane hepatitis, and is thought to result from the metabolism of halothane to trifluoroacetic acid via oxidative reactions in the liver. About 20% of inhaled halothane is metabolized by the liver and these products are excreted in the urine. The hepatitis syndrome had a mortality rate of 30% to 70%. Concern for hepatitis resulted in a dramatic reduction in the use of halothane for adults. It was replaced in the 1980s by enflurane and isoflurane. By the year 2005 the common volatile anesthetics in use were isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. Since the risk of halothane hepatitis in children was substantially lower than in adults, halothane saw continued use in pediatrics in the 1990s. However, by the year 2000 sevoflurane had largely replaced the use of halothane in children. Halothane sensitises the heart to catecholamines and this means that it is liable to cause cardiac arrythmias occasionally fatal, particularly if hypercapnia has been allowed to develop. This seems to be especially problematic in dental anaesthesia. Like all the potent inhalational anaesthetic agents it is a potent trigger for malignant hyperthermia. Similarly it relaxes uterine smooth muscle and this may increase blood loss during delivery or termination of pregnancy.

[ Synthesis ] The commercial synthesis of halothane starts from trichloroethylene, which is reacted with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of antimony trichloride at 130 °C to form 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane. This is then reacted with bromine at 450 °C to produce halothane.

Imperial Chemical Industries 6JpaAAAAEBAJ ] 650px [ Related substances ] Attempts to find anesthetics with less metabolism led to halogenated ether s such as enflurane and isoflurane. The incidence of hepatic reactions with these agents is lower. The exact degree of hepatotoxic potential of enflurane is debated, although it is minimally metabolized. Isoflurane is essentially not metabolized and reports of associated liver injury are quite rare. Small amounts of trifluoroacetic acid can be formed from both halothane and isoflurane metabolism and possibly accounts for cross sensitization of patients between these agents. The main advantage of the more modern agents is lower blood solubility resulting in faster induction of and recovery from anaesthesia. [ References ] [ Further reading ] Atkinson, Rushman, Lee.
