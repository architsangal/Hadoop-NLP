Since 1984, singer and guitarist Buzz Osborne (also known as King Buzzo) and drummer Dale Crover have been the band&apos;s ongoing members. The band was named after a supervisor at a Thriftway in Montesano, Washington, where Osborne also worked as a clerk. &quot; Melvin &quot; was despised by other employees, and the band&apos;s members felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name. The Melvins&apos; music is influenced by Black Flag &apos;s mix of punk and metal on their album My War, and other slow punk acts like Swans, Flipper and Wipers, but also by some hard rock and metal bands such as Kiss and Alice Cooper; however, their idiosyncratic approach, bizarre sense of humor, and experimentation make neat categorization difficult. Osborne has also stated that his guitar playing is more influenced by Black Flag than Black Sabbath, whom they are often compared with. They often favor very slow tempos, and their sludgy sound was a strong influence on music, especially Nirvana, Soundgarden, Green River, and many other bands from Seattle. These bands, however, tended to use more conventional musical structures with this sound. Melvins have also influenced many bands outside the Seattle grunge scene, including Tool [ http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action%3Dview-article%26amp%3Bid%3DMarch_1997--Alternative_Press.html Tool interview in Alternative Press from March 1997 Toolshed.down.net 2011-07-17 ] (who are personal friends with the band), Boris [ http://www.allmusic.com/artist/boris-p476294 Boris York, William AllMusic 2011-07-24 ] (who took their name from the title of a Melvins song), Mastodon, [ http://rankandrevue.com/archives/rr20/wendy.htm VOL. 1, Issue 20, FREE LIKE YOU Rank and Revue 2012-02-19 ] [ http://www.fooarchive.com/gpb/rebelmeetsrebel.htm Kerrang! - Dave Grohl&apos;s Wembley preview - May &apos;08 Fooarchive.com 2012-02-19 ] Neurosis, [ http://www.ram.org/music/articles/neurosisinterview.html Interview with Scott Kelly of Neurosis Ram.org 2000-10-17 2012-02-19 ] Eyehategod, [ http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eyehategod-p38682 Eyehategod Huey, Steve AllMusic 2012-02-19 The misanthropic sludge metal outfit Eyehategod was [...] heavily influenced by Black Sabbath, Black Flag, and the Melvins. ] and Isis.

In the beginning they played Cream and Jimi Hendrix covers, { Azerrad, Michael. Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana. Doubleday, 1994. ISBN 0-385-47199-8 } and also began playing fast hardcore punk. [ http://www.punknews.org/review/4087 Melvins – Mangled Demos From 1983 Punknews.org 2011-07-17 ] When Dillard left the band, Dale Crover took his place, and the band&apos;s rehearsals moved to a back room of Crover&apos;s parents house in Aberdeen, Washington. Soon afterward, they started to play songs slower and &quot; heavier &quot; than nearly anyone else at the time. In 1985, C/Z Records was created to document the Washington music scene, the label released Deep Six, featuring four songs by Melvins. In 1986 the band released their debut, the Six Songs EP, on C/Z Records (later releases expanded and retitled this as 8 Songs, 10 Songs, and eventually 26 Songs in 2003 on Ipecac Recordings ). The album was recorded live to a two track at Ironwood, February 8, 1986. In December 1986, they recorded their first full-length album, Gluey Porch Treatments, at Studio D in Sausalito, California. The album was released in 1987 on Alchemy Records. Gluey Porch Treatments was later coupled with their second album Ozma for the Boner Records CD release. It was expanded again for the 1999 rerelease on Ipecac Recordings with some garage demos. Crover played drums with Nirvana when they recorded a ten song demo on January 23, 1988 in Seattle, which later formed part of their debut LP Bleach, and played a live show in Tacoma later that day. Osborne would later introduce Cobain and Krist Novoselic to Dave Grohl. [ Seattle Weekly: Krist Novoselic: We All Owe Something to The Melvins http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2009/01/krist_novoselic_we_all_owe_som_1.php 2009-01-23. ] Later that year Osborne and Crover relocated to San Francisco, California. Lukin stayed and formed the band Mudhoney. Lori &quot; Lorax &quot; Black (daughter of Shirley Temple ) replaced Lukin on bass. The band recorded Ozma in May 1989, and released it later that year. The album was produced by Mark Deutrom, who later joined the band on bass. [ The early 1990s ] In 1990, the band recorded Bullhead, which marked a slower, more drone-oriented style for the band. The band then toured Europe; their January 23, 1991 show in Alzey, Germany was released by Your Choice Records as Your Choice Live Series Vol.12. When they returned to the U.S., they recorded the Eggnog EP, which was released the same year on Boner Records. Lorax left the band, and was replaced by Joe Preston. Preston appears on the Salad of a Thousand Delights (1992, Box Dog Video). Melvins then released three &quot; solo &quot; EPs, [ Taylor Lewis May 17, 2002 Melvins blazing new trails The Register-Guard pp. 5–6 http://news.google.com/newspapers?id%3DNXUVAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3DqOsDAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bdq%3Dmike-dillard%20melvins%26amp%3Bpg%3D4260%2C4656921 November 27, 2009. ] following the concept and imitating the cover artwork inspired by the four Kiss members&apos; solo albums released in 1978. King Buzzo, Dale Crover, and Joe Preston were all released in 1992 on Boner Records. Later in 1992, they released the full-length album, Lysol, which had to be renamed Melvins because Lysol was a trademarked name. Preston departed from the band, and Lorax briefly rejoined. [ The Atlantic years ] When Nirvana&apos;s Nevermind became a massive, unexpected success, Melvins were one of many groups to benefit from Nirvana&apos;s support. They were signed by Atlantic Records, and their first major label release, 1993&apos;s Houdini, entered the Billboard Heatseekers chart at 29. Mark Deutrom replaced Lorax on bass shortly after the album&apos;s release. Gene Simmons of Kiss played bass with Melvins at Lollapalooza in 1993 and 1994 for a full set. He also played bass with Melvins in 1993 in a concert with Primus, on the song Goin&apos; Blind, a Kiss song that Melvins had covered on Houdini.

Due to its experimental nature, the Melvins took their next album, Prick, to Amphetamine Reptile Records. Record label conflicts prevented the band from releasing any records under the name &quot; Melvins &quot;, so the album was released with the band name written in mirror. They returned to Atlantic one last time for 1996&apos;s Stag, which entered the Heatseekers chart at number 33. The band was dropped by Atlantic Records in 1997 after three albums. [ Late 1990s-mid 2000s ] The band signed with Amphetamine Reptile Records and released their next full-length album, Honky, in 1997. They recorded an August 1997 concert in Richmond, Melbourne, Australia as Alive at the F*ckerclub in 1998. The same year, Melvins opened for Tool. (A humorous picture on the Tool website depicts the Melvins along with the words &quot; Melvins say...Tool Sux! &quot; spelled out in lunch meat. [ http://toolband.com/melvinsuck.html Melvins photo on the Tool website Toolband.com 2011-07-17 ] The photo was taken while on tour with Tool in 2002 in Australia.) In 1998, the Melvins played the second stage at Ozzfest. 1999 saw the beginning of a partnership with Mike Patton &apos;s Ipecac Recordings, which began remastering and reissuing much of the band&apos;s back catalog. The band also released three full-length albums dubbed (and later packaged together as) The Trilogy: The Maggot, The Bootlicker, and The Crybaby. The latter featured a number of guest vocalists and musicians. Kevin Rutmanis, formerly of The Cows, was bassist during this era. In 2001, the band returned to their experimental tendencies for Colossus of Destiny, a live set of synthesizer and sampler experiments presented as two tracks (one clocking in at 59:23 and the other at five seconds). The album was described approvingly by one critic as &quot; more like avant-garde electro-acoustic than anything else. &quot; [ Schulte Tom The Colossus of Destiny - Melvins AllMusic 2011-07-06 ] In 2003 Atlantic Records (UK) released Melvinmania: The Best of the Atlantic Years 1993–1996, a compilation of recycled tracks from the band&apos;s three major label releases. This release was unsanctioned by the band who had no input into the track selection or (occasionally inaccurate) liner notes. In 2004, Osborne and Crover toured to celebrate their 20th anniversary as a band, and also released an art book Neither Here Nor There. The book is a collection of art by creators of their cover art as well as friends of the band, and also contained retrospectives on the past twenty years of the Melvins. The book included a CD with selected tracks from their albums. [ Mid 2000s-present ] In 2004 the Melvins collaborated with ambient artist Lustmord for Pigs of the Roman Empire and with Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra for Never Breathe What You Can&apos;t See and Sieg Howdy! released in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Never Breathe What You Can&apos;t See was supported by a mini-tour with Jello Biafra and Adam Jones from Tool. A planned European tour was canceled in early October 2004 reportedly due to unknown complications involving Rutmanis. Following the tour cancellation, the Melvins finished the year playing a few shows with David Scott Stone supporting the work of filmmaker Cameron Jamie in Europe and the United States. When asked about Rutmanis and the canceled portion of the tour Osborne and Crover stated that Rutmanis had &quot; disappeared &quot;. Fans feared that Rutmanis had departed like so many bassists before him; however, Rutmanis returned temporarily in early 2005. In June 2005, Rutmanis officially left the band with drug abuse rumored as the major cause. When Melvins toured with Jello Biafra in October and November 2005, David Scott Stone filled in on bass. In early 2006, Crover confirmed rumors of the members of the band Big Business joining Melvins. Commenting on adding another drummer, Crover said this about Big Business drummer Coady Willis : &quot; He&apos;s left-handed, so we want to do this &apos;mirror image&apos; type of thing. We&apos;ve kind of fused our two drum sets together, and we&apos;re going to try and do some crazy thing with it. We&apos;re sharing these big toms in between us. &quot; The merged bands toured the U.S. in the fall of 2006 in support of their album, (A) Senile Animal.

Two new songs entitled &quot; Suicide in Progress &quot; and &quot; Billy Fish &quot; have been played during the 2007 tour, and appear on their next album Nude With Boots. On June 16 and 17, 2008, a line up of Osborne, original drummer Mike Dillard, and Dale Crover (playing bass) played two shows at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco in honor of Jello Biafra &apos;s 50th birthday. Both sets were composed of songs from The Mangled Demos, a collection of early material released on the Alternative Tentacles record label in 2005. In 2008 the band collaborated with the Italian band Zu on a track. In July 2008, their new album entitled Nude With Boots was released. Some of the recording sessions have been documented on a Japanese blog by Toshi Kasai. { toshimanaki.pics Japanese blog by Toshi Kasai featuring Melvins session photos 2008 } In December 2008, along with Mike Patton, Melvins co-curated an edition of the All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties Nightmare Before Christmas festival. They chose half of the lineup and also performed themselves. The long rumoured (since 2003) remix CD &quot; Chicken Switch &quot; was released on September 29, 2009 via Ipecac Recordings. Unlike usual remix cds where the remixer is given a single track to work with, for Chicken Switch each remixer was given a full album to work with and pull from to create their track. The Melvins joined with New Orleans&apos; super group Down and Weedeater for a North American tour in the Summer and Fall of 2009. The Melvins released their follow up to Nude With Boots, entitled The Bride Screamed Murder, on June 1, 2010.

Four of the shows were every Friday at Spaceland&apos;s in California. January 7 featured the current line-up playing Colossus of Destiny, Lysol, and Eggnog. Jan 14 featured a Melvins 1983 set followed by the band playing Houdini. Jan 21 featured a two-piece Melvins set followed by the current lineup playing Bullhead. Jan 28 featured the band playing a normal set followed by Stoner Witch. In early 2011 they had the unfortunate distinction of being on tour first in Christchurch, New Zealand at the time of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake then in Tokyo, Japan at the time of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.
