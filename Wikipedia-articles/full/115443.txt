Water Tower atop Reservoir Hill is a local landmark visible from many parts of Bowling Green. The Warren County Justice Center is the center of the local court system. Bowling Green is the third-most populous city in the state of Kentucky after Louisville and Lexington, with a population of 58,067 as of the 2010 Census. It is the county seat of Warren County [ 6 ] and the principal city of the Bowling Green, Kentucky Metropolitan Statistical Area with an estimated 2009 population of 120,595.

The land surrounded the [ 2 acre m2 on ] plot they had donated for the construction of public buildings. Bowling Green was the provisional capital of the Confederate government of Kentucky. In 2003, Bowling Green with its surrounding communities was designated as a &quot; metropolitan area &quot;. General Motors has an assembly plant in Bowling Green in which all Chevrolet Corvette s have been constructed since 1981 and Cadillac XLR s were being built there until production ended in the spring of 2009.

The third largest Kentucky public university, Western Kentucky University, is situated upon a hill in central Bowling Green. Its athletic teams are called Hilltoppers. The city is famous for the eponymous 1967 song, &quot; Bowling Green &quot;, by The Everly Brothers. [ History ] [ Settlement and incorporation ] The first Europeans credited with having settled the area now known as Bowling Green were Robert Moore, his brother George and General Elijah Covington. The Moore brothers arrived from Virginia around 1794. In 1798, only two years after Warren County had been formed, Robert Moore donated [ 2 acre m2 ] of land to county trustee s for the purpose of constructing public buildings. Soon after, he donated an additional [ 30 acre m2 ] to [ 40 acre m2 ] surrounding the original plot. The city of Bowling Green was officially incorporated by the state of Kentucky on March 6, 1798. The choice of the name Bowling Green has not been attributed to any single source by historians. Some say at the first county commissioners&apos; meeting in early 1798, the pioneers decided that the new town would be &quot; called and known &quot; by the name of Bolin Green. &quot; This name was after the Bowling Green in New York City, where patriots had pulled down a statue of King George III and used the lead to make bullets during the American Revolution. Others say the Virginian settlers may have been honoring Bowling Green, Virginia. Still others say, Robert Moore kept a &quot; ball alley game &quot; on his residence which guests called bowling on the green. [ Encyclopedia of Kentucky Dictionary of Places: Bowling Green Somerset Publishers New York, New York 1987 0-403-09981-1 ] Early records indicate that the city name was also spelled Bowlingreen and Bolin Green. [ Nineteenth century ] By 1810, Bowling Green had only 154 residents. Growth in steamboat commerce and the proximity of the Barren River increased Bowling Green&apos;s importance. Canal lock s and dam s on the Barren River made it much more navigable. In 1832, the first portage railway was made from the river to where the current county courthouse stands. Mules pulled freight and passengers to and from the city on the tracks. Despite rapid urbanization of the Bowling Green area in the 1830s, agriculture remained an important part of local life. A visitor to Bowling Green noted the boasting of a tavern proprietor named Benjamin Vance: [ [Vance] says that he has seen a turnip this fall that measures thirty-two inches around, and has a beet that weighs sixteen pounds and a half;... that corn in this country grows so fast that if you look at it the next, it has grown a foot higher; that the &quot; little hickory twigs &quot; growing in the barrens have roots as large as his legs... ] In 1859, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (currently CSX Transportation ) laid railroad through Bowling Green that connected the city with northern and southern markets. Bowling Green declared itself neutral in the American Civil War. Because of its prime location and resources, both the Union and Confederacy sought control of the city. The majority of residents took the side of the Confederacy. On September 18, 1861, to the delight of the Bowling Green residents, the Confederacy succeeded in occupying Bowling Green under the command of General Simon Bolivar Buckner. Surrounding hills were fortified to secure any possible military approaches to the valuable river and railroad assets. The provisional Confederate government of Kentucky chose Bowling Green as its capital in November 1861. [ Kleber, John E. Associate editors: Thomas D. Clark, Lowell H. Harrison, and James C. Klotter The Kentucky Encyclopedia 1992 The University Press of Kentucky Lexington, Kentucky 0-8131-1772-0 Confederate State Government ] On February 14, 1862, after receiving reports that Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River had been captured by Union forces, the Confederates ended their occupation of Bowling Green. During their retreat, the Confederates destroyed bridges across the Barren River, the railroad depot and other important buildings. The city was subject to various disruptions and raids throughout the remainder of the war. During the summer of 1864, Union general Stephen G. Burbridge arrested 22 men in and around Bowling Green on suspicion of treason. This incident and other harsh treatment by federal authorities during the war led to bitterness among Bowling Green residents toward the Union and sympathies with the Confederacy. After the Civil War, Bowling Green&apos;s business district grew considerably. Previously, agriculture had dominated the city&apos;s economy. During the 1870s, many of the historic business structures seen today were erected. One of the most important businesses in Bowling Green of this era was Carie Burnam Taylor &apos;s dress-making company. By 1906, Taylor employed more than 200 women. In 1868, the city constructed its first waterworks system. The fourth county courthouse was completed in 1868. The first three were completed in 1798, 1805 and 1813 respectively. In 1889, the first mule-drawn street cars appeared in the city. The first electric street cars began to replace them by 1895. The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth founded St. Columbia&apos;s Academy in 1862, succeeded by St. Joseph&apos;s School in 1911. In 1884, the Southern Normal School, which had been founded in 1875, moved to Bowling Green from the town of Glasgow, Kentucky. Pleasant J. Potter founded a women&apos;s college in Bowling Green in 1889. It closed in 1909 and its property sold to the Western Kentucky State Normal School (see below, now known as Western Kentucky University ). Other important schools in this era were Methodist Warren College, Ogden College (which also became a part of Western Kentucky University) and Green River Female College, a boarding school. [ Twentieth century ] In 1906, Henry Hardin Cherry, the president and owner of Southern Normal School, donated the school to the state as the basis of the Western State Normal School. The school trained teachers for the expanding educational needs of the state. This institution is now known as Western Kentucky University and is the second largest public university in the state of Kentucky, having recently grown larger than the University of Louisville. In 1906, Doctors Lillian H. South, J. N. McCormack, A.T. McCormack opened St. Joseph Hospital to provide around the clock medical and nursing care to the residents and students in the area. [ http://www.warrencountymedicalsociety.org/Lillian%20South.htm Dr Lillian Herald South Warren County Medical Society official website Warren County Medical Society 1 April 2010 Bowling Green, Kentucky ] { Kentucky State Medical Association. (1913). Kentucky Medical Journal. Louisville, Ky: The Kentucky State Medical Association. page 160. Accessed on 31 March 2010. } In 1925, the Kentucky Street Rail Depot was opened. About 27 trains arrived daily at the depot. Local bus lines were also a popular form of travel. By the 1950s, both of these forms of transportation had dramatically declined as highway construction was subsidized by the federal government and the private car became the primary means of travel. In 1940, a Union Underwear factory was built in Bowling Green and bolstered the city&apos;s economy significantly. During the 1960s, the city&apos;s population began to surpass that of Ashland, Paducah and Newport. Downtown streets became a bottle-neck for traffic. In 1949, the U.S. Route 31W Bypass was opened to alleviate traffic problems but it also drew off business from downtown. The bypass grew to become a business hotspot in Bowling Green. A 1954 advertisement exclaimed, &quot; Your business can grow in the direction Bowling Green is growing -- to the 31-W By-Pass &quot;. By the 1960s, the face of shopping was changing completely from the downtown square to suburban shopping centers. Between May and November 1967, stores in Bowling Green Mall opened for business. Another advertisement said, &quot; One stop shopping. Just park [free], step out and shop. You&apos;ll find everything close at hand. &quot; Between September 1979 and September 1980, stores in the larger Greenwood Mall came inline. The city&apos;s limits began to stretch toward Interstate 65. By the late 1960s, Interstate 65, which runs just to the East of Bowling Green, was completed. The Green River Parkway (now called the William H. Natcher Parkway ), was completed in the 1970s to connect Bowling Green and Owensboro. These vital transportation arteries attracted many industries to Bowling Green. In 1981, General Motors moved its Chevrolet Corvette assembly plant from St. Louis, Missouri to Bowling Green. In the same year, the National Corvette Homecoming event was created, becoming a large gathering of Corvette owners, car parades and related activities in Bowling Green each year. In 1994 the National Corvette Museum was constructed near the assembly plant. In 1997, Bowling Green was designated a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation. [ Twenty-first century initiatives ] The new Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce building was one of the first parts of the Downtown Redevelopment Project to reach completion. In 2002, the city undertook a feasibility study on ways to revitalize downtown Bowling Green area. The Downtown Redevelopment Authority was formed to plan redevelopment. Plans for the project built on Bowling Green&apos;s waterfront assets and historic center and streetscape around Fountain Square. It also proposed a new building for the Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce, construction of a Riverwalk Park where downtown borders the Barren River, creation of a new public park called Circus Square, and installation of a new retail area, the Fountain Square Market. { The District - Accomplishments } As of the Spring of 2009, the new Chamber of Commerce, Riverwalk Park, and Circus Square have been completed. The Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center, a facility for arts and education, broke ground in October 2009. Ground has not yet been broken for the Fountain Square Market. In 2005 an effort was made to incorporate a Whitewater Park into the downtown Bowling Green riverfront at Weldon Peete Park. Due to the recession funding for the project fell through. However, as of summer 2010 the effort to have the Whitewater Park built is gaining momentum. Talks with public officials are being held and progress is being made. Information about the park can be found at: http://www.trailsrus.com/whitewater/initiative.html &amp; http://www.facebook.com/BGWWP [ Geography ] The Bowling Green-Warren County Regional Airport is [ 547 ft m ] above sea level.
