[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 0441976 } [ 3 ] Richmond ( [ icon ˈ r ɪ tʃ m ə n d ] ) is a city largely within Wayne Township, Wayne County, in east central Indiana, United States, which borders Ohio. The city also includes the Richmond Municipal Airport, which is in Boston Township and separated from the rest of the city. It is sometimes called the &quot; cradle of recorded jazz &quot; because some early jazz records were made here at the studio of Gennett Records, a division of the Starr Piano Company. { Starr Gennett Foundation, http://starrgennett.org/, URL accessed May 29, 2006. } Richmond is the county seat of Wayne County. The city&apos;s 2010 population was 36,812. Like many cities that formerly depended on manufacturing, Richmond is having to create a new economy. Its rich architectural heritage and Main Street attest to a strong base. The city has twice received the All-America City Award, most recently in a youth-initiated 2009 effort.

[ July 2011 ] In 1806 the first European Americans, Quaker families from North Carolina, settled along the East Fork of the Whitewater River. This was part of a general westward migration in the early decades after the American Revolution. John Smith and David Hoover were among the earliest settlers. Richmond is still home to several Quaker institutions, including Friends United Meeting, Earlham College and the Earlham School of Religion. The city was connected to the National Road, the first road built by the federal government and a major route west for pioneers of the 19th century. { &quot; Road through the Wilderness: The Making of the National Road &quot;, URL accessed May 30, 2006. } It became part of the system of National Auto Trail s. The highway is now known as 25px U.S. Highway 40. One of the extant Madonna of the Trail monuments was dedicated at Richmond on October 28, 1928 { &quot; Madonna of the Trail &quot;, Wayne County, URL accessed May 30, 2006. } The monument sits in a corner of Glen Miller Park adjacent to US 40. Madonna of the Trail statue in Glen Miller Park Early cinema and television pioneer Charles Francis Jenkins grew-up on a farm north of Richmond, where he began inventing useful gadgets. As the Richmond Telegram reported, on June 6, 1894, Jenkins gathered his family, friends and newsmen at Jenkins&apos; cousin&apos;s jewelry store in downtown Richmond and projected a filmed motion picture for the first time in front of an audience. The motion picture was of a vaudeville entertainer performing a butterfly dance, which Jenkins had filmed himself. Jenkins filed for a patent for the Phantoscope projector in November 1894 and it was issued in March of &apos;95. A modified version of the Phantoscope was later sold to Thomas Edison who named it Edison&apos;s Vitascope and began projecting motion pictures in New York City vaudeville theaters, raising the curtain on American cinema. Richmond is believed [ July 2011 ] to have been the smallest community in the United States to have supported a professional opera company and symphony orchestra. The Whitewater Opera has since closed but the Richmond Symphony Orchestra has continued. In 1899 Will Earhart formed the first complete high school orchestra in the nation. A later high school orchestra director, Joseph E. Maddy, went on to found what is now known as the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan. Also notable was the fact that Hoagy Carmichael recorded &quot; Stardust &quot; for the first time in Richmond at the Gennett recording studio. A group of artists in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries came to be known as the Richmond Group. They included John Elwood Bundy, Charles Conner, George Herbert Baker, Maude Kaufman Eggemeyer and John Albert Seaford, among others. The Richmond Art Museum has a collection of regional and American art. { Richmond Art Museum, http://www.richmondartmuseum.org/, URL accessed May 30, 2006. } Many consider the most significant painting in the collection to be a self-portrait of Indiana-born William Merritt Chase. {, William Merritt Chase, &apos;&apos;Self-portrait: The Artist in his Studio, 1916&apos;&apos;, URL accessed May 30, 2006 } Richmond&apos;s cultural resources include two of Indiana&apos;s three Egyptian mummies. One is held by the Wayne County Historical Museum and the second by Earlham College &apos;s Joseph Moore Museum. { Wayne County Historical Museum, http://waynecountyhistoricalmuseum.com/, URL accessed December 13, 2008. } { Joseph Moore Museum, http://www.waynet.org/nonprofit/jos_moore.htm, URL accessed December 13, 2008. } The arts were supported by a strong economy increasingly based on manufacturing. Richmond was once known as &quot; the lawn mower capital &quot; because it was a center for manufacturing of lawn mower s from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century. Manufacturers included Davis, Motomower, Dille-McGuire and F &amp; N. The farm machinery builder Gaar-Scott was based in Richmond. The Davis Aircraft Co., [ http://www.airventuremuseum.org/collection/aircraft/Davis%20D-1-W.asp Davis D-1-W Airventuremuseum.org 1933-11-22 2011-09-19 ] [ http://www.davismonoplane.com/ Davis Monoplane Davis Monoplane 2011-09-19 ] builder of a light parasol wing monoplane, operated in Richmond beginning in 1929. After starting out in nearby Union City, Wayne Agricultural Works moved to Richmond. Wayne was a manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles, including &quot; kid hack s &quot;, a precursor of the motorized school bus. From the early 1930s through the 1940s, several automobile designers and manufacturers were located in Richmond. Among the automobiles locally manufactured were the Richmond, built by the Wayne Works; the &quot; Rodefeld &quot;; the Davis; the Pilot; the Westcott and the Crosley. In the 1950s, Wayne Works changed its name to Wayne Corporation, by then a well-known bus and school-bus manufacturer. In 1967 it relocated to a site adjacent to Interstate 70. The company was a leader in school-bus safety innovations, but it closed in 1992 during a period of school-bus manufacturing industry consolidations. [ July 2011 ] Richmond was known as the &quot; Rose City &quot; because of the many varieties once grown there by Hill&apos;s Roses. The company had several sprawling complexes of greenhouses, with a total of about [ 34 acre m2 ] under glass. The annual Richmond Rose Festival honored the rose industry and was a popular summer attraction. [ Race and the Ku Klux Klan ] In the 1920s during the national revival of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), Indiana had the strongest organization in the country, led by Grand Dragons D. C. Stephenson and Walter F. Bossert. Some men initially joined the KKK as a fraternal organization, as that was how it was marketed. In addition, they were banding together in reaction to the influx of newcomers arriving for industrial jobs: especially Catholic immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, and rural black migrants from the South. The KKK had members in the state legislature who exerted control and an ally in Governor Ed Jackson. { &quot; Ku Klux Klan Resources &quot;, Indiana Division, Indiana State Library, URL accessed May 30, 2006 } At its height, national membership during the second Klan movement reached 1.5 million, with 300,000 from Indiana. { &quot; Ku Klux Klan &quot;, Wayne County, Indiana Records, 1916–1933, Indiana History, URL accessed May 29, 2006 } Records show that Richmond (home to Whitewater Klan #60) and Wayne County were Klan strongholds, with up to 45 percent of the county&apos;s white males having been Klan members. Forty percent of Richmond&apos;s Kiwanis club members, thirty percent of its doctors, and 27 percent of its lawyers were Klan members, but none of the city&apos;s bank executives or most powerful business leaders were members. { Leonard J. Moore, Citizen Klansmen: The Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, 1921-1928, North Carolina Press, 1997. } In 1923 a reported 30,000 people watched a Klan parade through Richmond streets. { &quot; Spectacular array presented by Klan in mamoth [sic] parade &quot;, Richmond Evening Item, Oct. 6, 192, pp. 1, 2 } Richmondite Robert Lyons was national chief of staff for the Klan. { &quot; Klan issue in Democrat race for president &quot;, Richmond Evening Item, May 14, 1924, p. 1. } Gennett Records was making some of the first recordings of important black jazz artists, helping Richmond gain the nickname &quot; cradle of recorded jazz. &quot; { &quot; How the Early Jazz Captured by Gennett Influenced the Shape of Things to Come &quot;, http://starrgennett.org/stories/articles/way_station.htm, URL accessed May 29, 2006. } It also produced private-label contract recordings for the KKK. { Gennett Numerical Series, http://www.vjm.biz/new_page_6.htm, URL accesses May 29, 1006, } Official racial segregation existed in Richmond until 1965, when the city ended its policy of restricting black firefighters to one station and limiting promotion opportunities of firefighters and police officers. That same year the state of Indiana repealed its standing, but seldom enforced, anti-miscegenation law. [ 20th century challenges ] On April 6, 1968, a natural gas explosion and fire destroyed or damaged several downtown blocks and killed 41 people; more than 150 were injured. { &apos;&apos;Death in a Sunny Street : The Civil Defense Story of the Richmond, Indiana Disaster, April 6, 1968&apos;&apos;, URL accessed May 29, 2006. } The book Death in a Sunny Street is about the event. In the rebuilding effort, the city closed the main street through downtown to traffic and built the Downtown Promenade in 1972 (expanded in 1978). When studies showed that car traffic helped businesses, the city had the five-block pedestrian mall broken up. It reopened the street to traffic in 1997 as part of an urban revitalization effort. [ Architecture ] Wayne County Court House Richmond is noted for its rich stock of historic architecture. In 2003, a book entitled Richmond Indiana: Its Physical Development and Aesthetic Heritage to 1920 by Cornell University architectural historians, Michael and Mary Raddant Tomlan, was published by the Indiana Historical Society. Particularly notable buildings are the 1902 Pennsylvania Railroad Station designed by Daniel Burnham of Chicago and the 1893 Wayne County Court House designed by James W. McLaughlin of Cincinnati. Local architects of note include John A. Hasecoster, William S. Kaufman and Stephen O. Yates. The significance of the architecture has been recognized. Five large districts, such as the Depot District, and several individual buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the Historic American Buildings Survey and the Historic American Engineering Record. [ Educational institutions ] Richmond has four colleges: Earlham College, Indiana University East, Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana and the Purdue University School of Technology. Richmond is home to two seminaries : Earlham School of Religion ( Quaker ) and Bethany Theological Seminary ( Church of the Brethren ) Richmond High School includes the Richmond Art Museum and Civic Hall Performing Arts Center and the Tiernan Center, the 5th-largest high school gym in the United States. Seton Catholic High School (founded 2002), a junior and senior high school, is the area&apos;s only religious high school. It is based in the former home of St. Andrew High School (1899–1936) and, more recently, St. Andrew Elementary School, adjacent to St. Andrew Church of the Richmond Catholic Community.
