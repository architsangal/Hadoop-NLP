[ Patagonian toothfish Toothfish.jpg 250px Animal ia Chordata Actinopterygii Perciformes Nototheniidae Dissostichus D. eleginoides Dissostichus eleginoides Smitt, 1898 ] The Patagonian toothfish, Dissostichus eleginoides (also known as Chilean sea bass in the USA and Canada, it is illegal to call it Chilean Seabass in the UK under the Fish Labelling(England) regulations 2010), is a fish found in the cold, temperate waters (between depths of [ 45 m ft 0 on ] to [ 3850 m ft 0 on ] ) of the southern Atlantic, southern Pacific, Indian, and Southern Ocean s on seamount s and continental shelves around most sub- Antarctic islands. A close relative, the Antarctic toothfish ( Dissostichus mawsoni ), is found farther south around the edges of the Antarctic shelf; it also lives in the Ross Sea. The average weight of a commercially caught Patagonian toothfish is [ 9 - 10 kg lb on ], with large adults occasionally exceeding [ 200 kg lb ]. They are thought to live up to fifty years { Collins MA, Brickle P, Brown J and Belchier M (2010) &quot; The Patagonian toothfish: biology, ecology and fishery &quot; In: M Lesser (Ed.) Advances in Marine Biology, Volume 58, pp. 229–289, Academic Press. ISBN 978-0-12-381015-1. } and to reach a length up to [ 2.3 m ft 1 on ]. A commercial fishery exists for Patagonian toothfish; the meat is sold under the trade name s Chilean sea bass in the USA; [ es merluza negra ] Argentina, and Uruguay where it is relatively cheap; and mero in Chile, South Korea, and Japan where it is sold at high prices. The name Chilean Sea Bass supposedly originated as part of a marketing gimmick to make the fish more marketable (as opposed to selling Patagonian toothfish). [ Dissostichus eleginoides 2005 November ] Patagonian toothfish feed largely on squid, fish, and prawns and, in turn, constitute a large part of the diets of sperm whale s, southern elephant seal s, and colossal squid. [ Legal fishing ] France severely regulates Patagonian toothfish in the waters surrounding the French islands in the South Indian Ocean ( Crozet Island, Kerguelen Islands ), with scientific oversight from the National museum of natural history { Arrêté 2008-62 du 23 juillet 2008, Journal officiel des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises, n°39, 3e semestre 2008 } Fishing authorizations are granted to a limited number of fisheries from Reunion Island; before 1998, there had been agreements with other countries authorizing their ships to fish in these waters. { Terres australes et antarctiques françaises, Pêche dans les subantarctiques } { Journal officiel des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises, n⁴2, 2nd semestre 2009 lists a number of such decisions. } In Australia, two companies are licensed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) to fish for Patagonian toothfish; these are Austral Fisheries and Australian Longline. The companies have legal access to the Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI) fishery, as well as the Macquarie Island fishery and have quotas set by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. { http://www.colto.org/fisheries/ } { The Age. 25 November 2007. Ari Sharp. &quot; Melbourne develops a taste for medium rare toothfish &quot;. page 7. } About 2450 tonnes of the annual 2550 tonnes caught in Australian Antarctic waters is sold overseas, mainly to Japanese and US markets. { http://www.colto.org/fisheries/ } The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) supervises some of the legal Patagonian toothfish harvesting. [ http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/animals/fish Fish » Australian Antarctic Division antarctica.gov.au Commonwealth of Australia June 30, 2011 Commercial fishing of the Patagonian toothfish is managed by CCAMLR (the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic and Marine Living Resources) around most of the subantarctic Islands, but not off the southern coast of South America. August 12, 2011 ] The Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators, Inc. (COLTO) claims to represent the legal toothfishing industry. { &quot; Objects of Association &quot; 3.1.d of the Constitution of COLTO. } [ Illegal fishing ] In the late 1990s to early 2000s, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated ( IUU ) fishing for toothfish nearly collapsed many nations&apos; fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Though, since 2005, thanks to CCAMLR Member nations, government patrol vessels, eNGOs, media exposure and a plethora of port state measures, IUU fishing has been all but eliminated from within countries&apos; exclusive economic zones, though a relatively small portion of catch in the high seas is the only unregulated catch being exploited currently. { www.ccamlr.org } In the last few years, the management of several fisheries has improved with increased patrolling for illegal vessels and stringent regulations for legal operators. Although unregulated fishing is still a problem in some high seas areas, the Marine Stewardship Council has certified the fishery in South Georgia for sustainable management. South Georgia has the largest toothfish fishery, with a total allowable catch (TAC) of around 3000 tonnes per year, taken by approximately ten vessels. Currently, there are a number of other toothfish fisheries that are undergoing review for MSC certification. { www.colto.org } The Patagonian toothfish lives in deep waters, from [ 300 - 3500 m ft 0 on ] on seamount s and continental shelves around most sub-Antarctic islands, such as the exclusive economic zone of the French Southern Territories ( Kerguelen Islands ) and around South Africa &apos;s Prince Edward Islands, and Australia &apos;s Heard Island and McDonald Islands. In the past, France sold some fishing rights to Japanese and other foreign fisheries; because of overfishing, now fishing is reserved for fisheries from Réunion Island. Because of poaching, the French Navy patrols the zone and has made numerous arrests and seizures. Australian Customs vessels have pursued illegal toothfishing ships; the chase in the Viarsa incident went on for 7200 kilometers. [ http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/22/1061529336367.html Chase around the world for white gold National News The Sydney Morning Herald 2003-08-23 ] Illegal fishing for toothfish in the Southern Ocean is hazardous not only for the fish, but also for other wildlife in and around the waters. According to The Antarctica Project, &quot; It is common practice in the illegal fishery to dynamite the [sperm and killer] whales when they are discovered in the area where the fishing takes place &quot; { Antarctica Project, The., Secretariat for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, The. 2001, April. &lt; u &gt; Newsletter &lt; /u &gt; (Vol. 10, Iss. 1) } { IUCN. 2003. &apos;&apos;Dolphins, Whales and Porpoises&apos;&apos; } and &quot; …hundreds of thousands of endangered albatrosses and petrels dive for the [fish] bait and become hooked and drowned. &quot; The longline fishery has also been criticized for drowning thousands of seabird s, such as albatross es. [ Threats ] The Chilean sea bass is listed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium on its Seafood Watch list and pocket guides as a fish to avoid due to overfishing and high levels of mercury. { Chilean Sea Bass - Seafood Watch } In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Patagonian toothfish to its seafood red list. &quot; The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries. &quot; { Greenpeace International Seafood Red list } [ Notes ] [ 2 ] [ References ] [ 642807 Dissostichus eleginoides 19 March 2006 ] Clover, Charles. 2004.
