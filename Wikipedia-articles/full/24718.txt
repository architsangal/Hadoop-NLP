A later study published in 2010 revealed that imaging of Rhea from the Cassini mission was inconsistent with the predicted properties of the rings, suggesting that some other mechanism is responsible for the magnetic effects that had led to the ring hypothesis.

The little dark spot on Saturn is the shadow from Saturn&apos;s moon } { Enceladus. } There are three ways that planetary rings (the rings around planets) have been proposed to have formed: from material of the protoplanetary disk that was within the Roche limit of the planet and thus could not coalesce to form moons; from the debris of a moon that was disrupted by a large impact; or from the debris of a moon that was disrupted by tidal stresses when it passed within the planet&apos;s Roche limit. Most rings were thought to be unstable and to dissipate over the course of tens or hundreds of millions of years, but it now appears that Saturn&apos;s rings might be quite old, dating to the early days of the Solar system. [ December 12, 2007 Saturn&apos;s Rings May Be Old Timers NASA (News Release 2007-149) http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini20071212.html 2008-04-11 ] The composition of ring particles varies; they may be silicate or icy dust. Larger rocks and boulders may also be present, and in 2007 tidal effects from eight &apos;moonlets&apos; only a few hundred meters across were detected within Saturn&apos;s rings. Sometimes rings will have &quot; shepherd &quot; moons, small moons that orbit near the outer edges of rings or within gaps in the rings. The gravity of shepherd moons serves to maintain a sharply defined edge to the ring; material that drifts closer to the shepherd moon&apos;s orbit is either deflected back into the body of the ring, ejected from the system, or accreted onto the moon itself. Several of Jupiter &apos;s small innermost moons, namely Metis and Adrastea, are within Jupiter&apos;s ring system and are also within Jupiter&apos;s Roche limit. [ Gunter Faure, Teresa M. Mensing 2007 Introduction to Planetary Science: The Geological Perspective Springer 978-1-4020-5233-0 ] It is possible that these rings are composed of material that is being pulled off of these two bodies by Jupiter&apos;s tidal force s, possibly facilitated by impacts of ring material on their surfaces. Uranus&apos; ε ring also has two shepherd satellites, Cordelia and Ophelia, acting as inner and outer shepherds respectively. [ Esposito L. W. Larry W.

[ 10.1006/icar.2001.6597 ] Neptune&apos;s rings are very unusual in that they first appeared to be composed of incomplete arcs in Earth-based observations, but Voyager 2 &apos;s images showed them to be complete rings with bright clumps.

Pluto is not known to have any ring systems. However, some astronomers think that the New Horizons probe might find a ring system when it visits in 2015. [ Andrew J. Steffl S.
