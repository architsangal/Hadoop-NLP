He has been described as the most known contemporary Indian musician by Hans Neuhoff in Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart. { Neuhoff 2006, pp. 672–673 } Shankar was born in Varanasi and spent his youth touring Europe and India with the dance group of his brother Uday Shankar. He gave up dancing in 1938 to study sitar playing under court musician Allauddin Khan. After finishing his studies in 1944, Shankar worked as a composer, creating the music for the Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray, and was music director of All India Radio, New Delhi, from 1949 to 1956. In 1956, he began to tour Europe and America playing Indian classical music and increased its popularity there in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and George Harrison of The Beatles. Shankar engaged Western music by writing concerti for sitar and orchestra and toured the world in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992 he served as a nominated member of the upper chamber of the Parliament of India. Shankar was awarded India&apos;s highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, in 1999, and received three Grammy Award s. He continues to perform in the 2000s, often with his daughter Anoushka. [ Early life ] Shankar was born 7 April 1920 in Varanasi to a Bengali Brahmin family as the youngest of seven brothers. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 48 } [ Hunt Ken Ravi Shankar – Biography Allmusic 15 July 2009 ] { Massey 1996, p. 159 } Shankar&apos;s Bengali birth name was Robindro Shaunkor Chowdhury. His father, Shyam Shankar, an administrator for the Maharaja of Jhalawar, used the Sanskrit spelling of the family name and removed its last part. { Ghosh 1983, p. 7 } Shyam was married to Shankar&apos;s mother Hemangini Devi, but later worked as a lawyer in London. There he married a second time while Devi raised Shankar in Varanasi, and did not meet his son until he was eight years old. Shankar shortened the Sanskrit version of his first name, Ravindra, to Ravi, for &quot; sun &quot;. At the age of ten, after spending his first decade in Varanasi, Shankar went to Paris with the dance group of his brother, choreographer Uday Shankar. { Slawek 2001, pp. 202–203 } { Ghosh 1983, p. 55 } By the age of 13 he had become a member of the group, accompanied its members on tour and learned to dance and play various Indian instruments. Uday&apos;s dance group toured Europe and America in the early to mid-1930s and Shankar learned French, discovered Western classical music, jazz, and cinema, and became acquainted with Western customs. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 50 } Shankar heard the lead musician for the Maihar court, Allauddin Khan, in December 1934 at a music conference in Kolkata and Uday convinced the Maharaja of Maihar in 1935 to allow Khan to become his group&apos;s soloist for a tour of Europe. Shankar was sporadically trained by Khan on tour, and Khan offered Shankar training to become a serious musician under the condition that he abandon touring and come to Maihar. [ Career ] [ Training and work in India ] Shankar&apos;s parents had died by the time he returned from the European tour, and touring the West had become difficult due to political conflicts that would lead to World War II. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 51 } Shankar gave up his dancing career in 1938 to go to Maihar and study Indian classical music as Khan&apos;s pupil, living with his family in the traditional gurukul system. Khan was a rigorous teacher and Shankar had training on sitar and surbahar, learned raga s and the musical styles dhrupad, dhamar, and khyal, and was taught the techniques of the instruments rudra veena, rubab, and sursingar. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 52 } He often studied with Khan&apos;s children Ali Akbar Khan and Annapurna Devi. Shankar began to perform publicly on sitar in December 1939 and his debut performance was a jugalbandi (duet) with Ali Akbar Khan, who played the string instrument sarod. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 53 } Shankar completed his training in 1944. Following his training, he moved to Mumbai and joined the Indian People&apos;s Theatre Association, for whom he composed music for ballets in 1945 and 1946. { Ghosh 1983, p. 57 } Shankar recomposed the music for the popular song &quot; Sare Jahan Se Achcha &quot; at the age of 25. { Sharma 2007, pp. 163–164 } [ Deb Arunabha Ravi Shankar: 10 interesting facts Mint 26 February 2009 http://www.livemint.com/2009/02/26212701/Ravi-Shankar-10-interesting-f.html 18 July 2009 ] He began to record music for HMV India and worked as a music director for All India Radio (AIR), New Delhi, from February 1949 to January 1956. Shankar founded the Indian National Orchestra at AIR and composed for it; his compositions experimented with a combination of Western instruments and classical Indian instrumentation. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 56 } Beginning in the mid-1950s he composed the music for the Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray, which became internationally acclaimed.

K. Narayana Menon, director of AIR Delhi, introduced the Western violinist Yehudi Menuhin to Shankar during Menuhin&apos;s first visit to India in 1952. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 47 } Shankar had performed as part of a cultural delegation in the Soviet Union in 1954 and Menuhin invited Shankar in 1955 to perform in New York City for a demonstration of Indian classical music, sponsored by the Ford Foundation. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 57 } { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 58 } Shankar declined to attend due to problems in his marriage, but recommended Ali Akbar Khan to play instead. Khan reluctantly accepted and performed with tabla (percussion) player Chatur Lal in the Museum of Modern Art, and he later became the first Indian classical musician to perform on American television and record a full raga performance, for Angel Records. { Lavezzoli 2006, pp. 58–59 } Shankar heard about the positive response Khan received and resigned from AIR in 1956 to tour the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 61 } He played for smaller audiences and educated them about Indian music, incorporating ragas from the South India n Carnatic music in his performances, and recorded his first LP album Three Ragas in London, released in 1956. In 1958, Shankar participated in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the United Nations and UNESCO music festival in Paris. From 1961, he toured Europe, the United States, and Australia, and became the first Indian to compose music for non-Indian films. Chatur Lal accompanied Shankar on tabla until 1962, when Alla Rakha assumed the role. Shankar founded the Kinnara School of Music in Mumbai in 1962. { Brockhaus, p. 199 } Shankar befriended Richard Bock, founder of World Pacific Records, on his first American tour and recorded most of his albums in the 1950s and 1960s for Bock&apos;s label. The Byrds recorded at the same studio and heard Shankar&apos;s music, which led them to incorporate some of its elements in theirs, introducing the genre to their friend George Harrison of The Beatles. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 62 } Harrison became interested in Indian classical music, bought a sitar and used it to record the song &quot; Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) &quot;. { Schaffner 1980, p. 64 } This led to Indian music being used by other musicians and created the raga rock trend. Harrison met Shankar in London in 1966 and visited India for six weeks to study sitar under Shankar in Srinagar.

George Harrison organized the charity Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, in which Shankar participated. Interest in Indian music had decreased in the early 1970s, but the concert album became one of the best-selling recordings featuring it and won Shankar a second Grammy Award. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 66 } During the 1970s, Shankar and Harrison worked together again, recording Shankar Family &amp; Friends in 1973 and touring North America the following year to a mixed response after Shankar had toured Europe with the Harrison-sponsored Music Festival from India. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 195 } The demanding schedule weakened Shankar, and he suffered a heart attack in Chicago in November 1974, causing him to miss a portion of the tour. { Lavezzoli 2006, p. 196 } In his absence, Shankar&apos;s sister-in-law, singer Lakshmi Shankar, conducted the touring orchestra.

His performances begin with solo alap, jor, and jhala (introduction and performances with pulse and rapid pulse) influenced by the slow and serious dhrupad genre, followed by a section with tabla accompaniment featuring compositions associated with the prevalent khyal style. Shankar often closes his performances with a piece inspired by the light-classical thumri genre. Shankar has been considered one of the top sitar players of the second half of the 20th century. He popularized performing on the bass octave of the sitar for the alap section and became known for a distinctive playing style in the middle and high registers that uses quick and short deviations of the playing string and his sound creation through stops and strikes on the main playing string. Narayana Menon of &apos;&apos;The New Grove Dictionary&apos;&apos; noted Shankar&apos;s liking for rhythmic novelties, among them the use of unconventional rhythmic cycles. { Menon 1995, p. 220 } Hans Neuhoff of Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart has argued that Shankar&apos;s playing style was not widely adopted and that he was surpassed by other sitar players in the performance of melodic passages. Shankar&apos;s interplay with Alla Rakha improved appreciation for tabla playing in Hindustani classical music. Shankar promoted the jugalbandi duet concert style and introduced new ragas, including Tilak Shyam, Nat Bhairav and Bairagi.
