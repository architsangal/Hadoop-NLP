Trio (or TRIO) was an American cable and satellite television network. Trio went on the air in 1994, then originally owned and operated jointly by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Power Broadcasting Inc. (a subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada ) as a venue for airing the CBC&apos;s arts, culture and entertainment programming in the U.S. It was sold to USA Networks in 2000, { http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/htmen/newsreleases/20000519.htm } and was subsequently transferred to Vivendi Universal and later NBC Universal. With the slogan, &quot; pop, culture, TV &quot;, Trio programming under Vivendi/NBC Universal ownership focused on television as a cultural tool and art form. In January 2005, Trio was dropped from DirecTV, eliminating about two-thirds of the homes that could receive the network. On November 21, 2005, NBC Universal announced that the Trio brand would be transferred to a broadband Internet TV initiative under the Bravotv.com banner on January 1, 2006. Cable and satellite providers still carrying Trio were offered a new NBC Universal cable network instead, Sleuth.
