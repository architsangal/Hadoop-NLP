By the time the first Spanish conquistadors arrived, there were over 250,000 Native Americans living on the peninsula. Some of these first early tribes were the Tocobago, Timucua, and the Calusa. In 1527, a Spanish road map showed a settlement near the Rio de la Paz. The arrival of the Spanish turned out to be disastrous to these Native American tribes. Within 150 years, the majority of the pre-Columbian Native American peoples of Florida had been mercilessly slaughtered. Those who had not succumbed to diseases such as Yellow Fever or Scarlet Fever were either killed or enslaved by the Spaniards and used as sexual vessels.
