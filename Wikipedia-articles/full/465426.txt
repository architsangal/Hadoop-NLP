[ 34.785217 -106.996512 type:landmark_region:US-NM title ] 350px The Los Lunas Decalogue Stone is a large boulder on the side of Hidden Mountain, near Los Lunas, New Mexico, about 35 miles south of Albuquerque, that bears a very regular inscription carved into a flat panel. The stone is also known as the Los Lunas Mystery Stone or Commandment Rock. The inscription is interpreted to be an abridged version of the Decalogue or Ten Commandments in a form of Paleo-Hebrew. A letter group resembling the tetragrammaton YHWH, or &quot; Yahweh, &quot; makes four appearances. The stone is controversial in that some claim the inscription is Pre-Columbian, and therefore proof of early Semitic contact with the Americas. The first recorded mention of the stone is in 1933, when professor Frank Hibben, an archaeologist from the University of New Mexico, saw it. Hibben was led to the stone by an unnamed guide who claimed to have found it as a boy in the 1880s. The 1880s date of discovery is important to those who believe that the stone was inscribed by a lost tribe of Israel. The Paleo-Hebrew script is practically identical to the Phoenician script, which was known at the time, thus not precluding the possibility of fraud. One argument against the stone&apos;s antiquity is its apparent use of modern Hebrew punctuation, though amateur epigrapher Barry Fell argued that the punctuation is consistent with antiquity. { Fell, Barry; &quot; Ancient Punctuation and the Los Lunas Text, &quot; Epigraphic Society, Occasional Publications, 13:35, 1985. } Other researchers dismiss the inscription based on the numerous stylistic and grammatical errors that appear in the inscription. Most modern scholars question much of Hibben&apos;s research today because of his work with alleged pre-Clovis sites. In at least two separate incidents, Hibben fabricated some or all of his archaeological data to support his pre-Clovis migration theory. { The Mystery of Sandia Cave, New Yorker, 71(16):66-83. } { A Chronological Problem Presented by Sandia Cave, New Mexico. American Antiquity, 1940a 5(3):200-201. } These missteps call the rest of his work into question, and, for many, undermine the validity of his claims about the Los Lunas Decalogue Stone.

Many visitors have cleaned the stone inscriptions over the years, likely destroying any possibility for scientific analysis of the inscriptions&apos; patina. Nevertheless, comparing it to a modern inscription nearby, geologist G. E. Morehouse, a colleague of Barry Fell, estimated that the inscription could be between 500 and 2000 years old and explaining its freshness and lack of patina as being due to frequent scrubbing to make it more visible. { Morehouse, George E.; &quot; The Los Lunas Inscriptions, a Geological Study, &quot; Epigraphic Society, Occasional Publications, 13:44, 1985. } The archaeologist Ken Feder points out that &quot; the flat face of the stone shows a very sharp, crisp inscription... &quot;. His main concern however is the lack of any archaeological context. He argues that to get to the location of the stone would have required whoever inscribed it to have &quot; stopped along the way. encamped, eaten food, broken things, disposed of trash, performed rituals, and so on. And those actions should have left a trail of physical archaeological evidence across the greater American Southwest, discovery of which would undeniably prove the existence of foreigners in New Mexico in antiquity with a demonstrably ancient Hebrew material culture... &quot; and states that &quot; There are no pre-Columbian ancient Hebrew settlements, no sites containing the everyday detritus of a band of ancient Hebrews, nothing that even a cursory knowledge of how the archaeological record forms would demand there would be. From an archaeological standpoint, that&apos;s plainly impossible. &quot; [ Feder Kenneth L.

The Los Lunas Decalogue Stone is often grouped with the Kensington Runestone, Dighton Rock, and the Newport Tower as examples of American landmarks with disputed provenances.
