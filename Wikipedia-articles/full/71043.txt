Davis ] Davis County is a county located in the U.S. state of Utah. As of 2010 the population was 306,479, a 28.2% increase over the 2000 figure of 238,994. [ Davis County Quickfacts from the US Census Bureau http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/49/49011.html ] It was named for Daniel C. Davis, captain in the Mormon Battalion. The county is part of the Ogden – Clearfield Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Salt Lake City –Ogden –Clearfield Combined Statistical Area. Its county seat is Farmington and its largest city is Layton. [ 6 ] Davis County also contains the Lagoon Amusement Park in Farmington, the main amusement park serving the Wasatch Front. [ History ] Davis County was created on October 5, 1850, with Farmington designated as its county seat, because of its geographic location midway between boundaries at the Weber River on the north and the Jordan River on the south. During its first 50 years, Davis County grew slowly. With the advent of the Utah Central Rail Road in 1870, a transition to mechanized agriculture and a surge of commerce, banking, improved roads, new water systems, and electrification of homes began. However, by 1940, the population was barely 16,000. With the establishment of Hill Air Force Base in northern Davis County, there was a surge of civilian employment after World War II. The county doubled in population between 1940 and 1950, and doubled again between 1950 and 1960 as part of the nationwide suburb boom that was occurring at the time. By 1990 there were 188,000 residents, and in 2000, there were 239,000. By 2030, the county is expected to have a population of about 360,000. Today, most of the population resides in Layton, Bountiful, Kaysville, and Clearfield while most of the growth is concentrated in the northwest, northeast, and southwest portions of the county, and especially in such cities as Syracuse, Clinton, West Point, South Weber, and Woods Cross. { Layton } [ Law and Government ] [ 18th Utah Senate District 21st Utah Senate District 22nd Utah Senate District 23rd Utah Senate District ] A three-member board of commissioners is the county&apos;s governing body. Each of these commissioners serve four-year terms, which overlap for the sake of continuity. They are responsible for all county services and operations. They approve, adopt, and amend the budget; they also serve as the legislative body and regulate business licensing in the county&apos;s unincorporated areas. The current county commissioners are John Petroff, Louenda Downs, and Bret Millburn, with Commissioner Petroff currently serving as Commission Chair and Commissioner Downs serving as Vice Chair.

[ Geography ] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of [ 634 sqmi km2 ], the smallest county in Utah, of which [ 304 sqmi km2 ] is land and [ 329 sqmi km2 ] (51.95%) is water. The county lies generally between the Great Salt Lake on the west and the Wasatch Range on the east, which rises to a height of [ 9707 ft m ] in the county at Thurston Peak. The Great Salt Lake in the west, which is surrounded by marshland and mudflat s, lies at an average elevation of approximately [ 4200 ft m ], varying depending on the water level, which can lead to drastic changes in the lake size due to its shallowness. Davis County includes Antelope Island, which is the largest island in the lake. The entire island is a state park, designated to protect natural scenery and especially wildlife on the island, which includes bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and a bison herd. The narrow, populated portion that lies between the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch Range is a portion of the Wasatch Front, which is very narrow at this point, complicating north-south transportation in the county. [ Adjacent counties ] Salt Lake County - south Morgan County - east Weber County - north Box Elder County - northwest - (water) Tooele County - west - (water) Davis County lies in a semiarid climate zone. Snow is frequent during winter, with up to [ 90 in cm on ] annually on high bench areas in the east and at least [ 60 in cm ] on the valley floor. Annual precipitation averages between [ 18 and 25 in mm ] in the county, with spring being the wettest season and summer the driest. Summers are hot, with several days each year averaging above [ 95 °F °C on ]. However, the humidity is low, making for comparatively comfortable temperatures. In winter, temperatures sometimes drop below [ 0 °F °C on ], but rarely for extended periods of time. Compared to Salt Lake County to the south, the weather in Davis County is extreme. Lake-effect snow s hit the southern portion of the county harder, and even in non-lake-effect storms, the lack of a rain shadow in Davis County (much of Salt Lake County lies in the rain shadow of the Oquirrh Mountains ) means that storms often hit Davis County harder. In addition, canyon winds from the east can sometimes cause devastating wind damage, and wind gusts above [ 100 mph km/h on ] have been reported. This occurs when a powerful high pressure system situates itself over Wyoming, and is a common occurrence. Extreme wind events, however, have seemed to decline in frequency in recent years. { Deseret News - &apos;Active&apos; weather — Neighboring counties Davis and S.L. differ widely in weather.

US-89 enters parallel to I-15 from Salt Lake County to the south and runs north through North Salt Lake and Bountiful as a city road before merging with I-15. It re-emerges again in Farmington near the Lagoon Amusement Park, heading along the eastern benches on the slopes of the Wasatch Range, entering Weber County near South Weber. US-89 is planned to eventually be upgraded to a freeway through eastern Layton north to its interchange with I-84 near the Weber County border. Congestion is a significant problem in the county, as east-west transportation is restricted by the narrow urban corridor and many of its citizens commute south to Salt Lake County. To relieve congestion in the county, the Legacy Parkway began construction in March 2006. Construction began near the US-89/I-15 interchange in Farmington in 2004, but was soon halted due to a lawsuit filed by environmentalist s, who were concerned that the road would harm marshlands along the eastern edge of the Great Salt Lake and asked for a review of the completeness of the environmental impact statement. A settlement was reached in November 2005 and the final injunction was lifted in February 2006. The Legacy Parkway opened on September 13, 2008, running from the US-89/I-15 interchange in Farmington southward to connect with I-215 near the border with Salt Lake County. An extensive trail system, wetland protection measures, and landscaping were implemented along the highway in response to the environmentalist&apos;s concerns, in addition to a lower speed limit and a ban of semi-trailer trucks on the highway.

The Legacy Parkway and FrontRunner commuter rail project recently finished construction to combat this problem. The commuter rail stations in the county have spurred plans for extensive transit-oriented development (TOD), including the Station Park development in Farmington, which, when completed, is expected to be the largest shopping center in Utah.
