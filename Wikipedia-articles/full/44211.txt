[ Shale Sedimentary ShaleUSGOV.jpg Shale Clay minerals and quartz ] Shale is a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock composed of mud that is a mix of flakes of clay mineral s and tiny fragments ( silt -sized particles) of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite. The ratio of clay to other minerals is variable. { Blatt, Harvey and Robert J. Tracy, 1996, Petrology: Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic, 2nd ed., Freeman, pp. 281–292 ISBN 0-7167-2438-3 } Shale is characterized by breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness, called fissility. Mudstone s, on the other hand, are similar in composition but do not show the fissility. [ Texture ] Shale typically exhibits varying degrees of fissility breaking into thin layers, often splintery and usually parallel to the otherwise indistinguishable bedding plane because of parallel orientation of clay mineral flakes. Non-fissile rocks of similar composition but made of particles smaller than 0.06  mm are described as mudstone s (1/3 to 2/3 silt particles) or claystone (less than 1/3 silt). Rocks with similar particle sizes but with less clay (greater than 2/3 silt) and therefore grittier are siltstone s. Shale is the most common sedimentary rock.

The sand grain is 2 mm in diameter. } [ Composition and color ] Shales are typically composed of variable amounts of clay minerals and quartz grains and the typical color is gray. Addition of variable amounts of minor constituents alters the color of the rock. Black shale results from the presence of greater than one percent carbonaceous material and indicates a reducing environment. Black shale can also be referred to as black metal.

Clays are the major constituent of shales and other mudrocks. The clay minerals represented are largely kaolinite, montmorillonite and illite. Clay minerals of Late Tertiary mudstones are expandable smectite s whereas in older rocks especially in mid to early Paleozoic shales illites predominate. The transformation of smectite to illite produces silica, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron and water. These released elements form authigenic quartz, chert, calcite, dolomite, ankerite, hematite and albite, all trace to minor (except quartz) minerals found in shales and other mudrocks. Shales and mudrock s contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks. However, this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale. Black shales which form in anoxic conditions contain reduced free carbon along with ferrous iron (Fe 2+ ) and sulfide (S 2- ). Pyrite and amorphous iron sulfide along with carbon produce the black and purple coloration. [ Formation ] { limestone, } { Cumberland Plateau, } { Tennessee } The process in the rock cycle which forms shale is compaction. The fine particles that compose shale can remain suspended in water long after the larger and denser particles of sand have deposited. Shales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and lagoon al deposits, in river delta s, on floodplain s and offshore from beach sands. They can also be deposited on the continental shelf, in relatively deep, quiet water. This process could have taken millions of years to complete. &apos;Black shales&apos; are dark, as a result of being especially rich in unoxidized carbon. Common in some Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata, black shales were deposited in anoxic, reducing environments, such as in stagnant water columns. Some black shales contain abundant heavy metals such as molybdenum, uranium, vanadium, and zinc. { R. Zangerl and E.S.

Shales may also contain concretion s consisting of pyrite, apatite, or various carbonate minerals. Shales that are subject to heat and pressure of metamorphism alter into a hard, fissile, metamorphic rock known as slate. With continued increase in metamorphic grade the sequence is phyllite, then schist and finally to gneiss. { Weathering shale at a road cut in southeastern } { Kentucky } [ See also ] [ 3 ] Bituminous shale Oil shale Burgess shale Barnett Shale Bearpaw Shale Shale gas Wianamatta shale Wheeler Shale Slate [ References ] Category:Sedimentary rocks ar:سجيل زيتي an:Loseta (roca) cs:Břidlice da:Lerskifer de:Tonschiefer et:Savikilt es:Pizarra (roca) fr:Schiste gl:Xisto ko:셰일 it:Shale (roccia) nl:Schalie (gesteente) ja:頁岩 no:Leirskifer nn:Skifer pnb:پرت pl:Łupek ilasty pt:Folhelho ru:Глинистый сланец sk:Bridlica (sediment) fi:Savikivi sv:Lerskiffer ta:களிப்பாறை uk:Глинистий сланець vi:Đá phiến sét zh:页岩 de:Schiefer simple:Shale
