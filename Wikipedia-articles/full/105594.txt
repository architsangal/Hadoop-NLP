[ History ] There is archaeological evidence that Inupiat people have lived at Kotzebue since at least the 15th century. Because of its location, Kotzebue was a trading and gathering center for the entire area. The Noatak, Selawik and Kobuk Rivers drain into the Kotzebue Sound near Kotzebue to form a center for transportation to points inland. In addition to people from interior villages, inhabitants of the Russian Far East came to trade at Kotzebue. Furs, seal-oil, hides, rifles, ammunition, and seal skins were some of the items traded. People also gathered for competitions like the current World Eskimo Indian Olympics. With the arrival of the whalers, traders, gold seekers, and missionaries the trading center expanded. Kotzebue, was known by natives as Kikiktagruk or Qikiqtagruk, which means &quot; almost an island &quot; in Inupiaq, the language of the Inupiat, which is a reference to the spit. The name of the town was later changed to Kotzebue after Baltic-German navigator Otto von Kotzebue as well as the name of the Kotzebue Sound. Reindeer herding was introduced in the area in 1897. Although Alaska had caribou, the wild form of reindeer, the domesticated reindeer were brought to Alaska from Asia. A United States post office was established in 1899. { Dickerson, Ora B.
