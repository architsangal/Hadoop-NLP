Municipality 118601 1491 CET +1 CEST +2 51.81 N 4.67 E ] { Rhine-Meuse delta, showing the Island of Dordrecht and the eponymous city (7) } Topographic map image of Dordrecht, 2011 Dordrecht ( [ ˈdɔr.trɛχt - Nl-Dordrecht.ogg ] ), colloquially Dordt [ dɔrt ], historically in English named Dort, is a city and municipality in the western Netherlands, located in the province of South Holland. It is the fourth largest city of the province, having a population of 118,601 in 2009. The municipality covers the entire Dordrecht Island, also often called Het Eiland van Dordt (the Island of Dordt), bordered by the rivers Oude Maas, Beneden Merwede, Nieuwe Merwede, Hollands Diep, and Dordtsche Kil. Dordrecht is the largest and most important city in the Drechtsteden and is also part of the Randstad, the main conurbation in the Netherlands. Dordrecht is the oldest city in Holland and has a rich history and culture. [ Etymology ] The name Dordrecht comes from Thyre, the name of a river, and Middle Dutch drecht &quot; ford &quot;, thus meaning &quot; Thure river crossing &quot;. Some documentation speaks of the river actually being called Thuredrith. Inhabitants of Dordrecht are Dordtenaren (singular: Dordtenaar). Dordrecht is informally called Dordt by its inhabitants. In earlier centuries, Dordrecht was a major trade port, well-known to British merchants, and was called Dort in English. [ History ] [ Early History ] The city was formed along the Thure river, in the midst of peat swamps. This river was a branch of the river Dubbel and ran approximately near the current Bagijnhof. Around 1120 the first reference to Dordrecht was made by a remark that count Dirk IV was murdered 1049 near &quot; Thuredrech &quot;. { Aelbert Cuyp. } Dordrecht was granted city rights by William I, Count of Holland, in 1220, making it the oldest city in the present province of South Holland. In fact, Geertruidenberg was the first city in the historical county of Holland to receive city rights, but this municipality currently is part of the province of Noord-Brabant. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Dordrecht developed into an important market city because of its strategic location. It traded primarily in wine, wood and cereals. Dordrecht was made even more important when it was given staple right in 1299. In 1253 a Latin school was founded in Dordrecht. It still exists today as the Johan de Witt Gymnasium and is the oldest gymnasium in the Netherlands. From 1600 to 1615 Gerhard Johann Vossius was rector at this school. On 17 April 1421, the Saint Elisabeth&apos;s flood flooded large parts of southern Holland, causing Dordrecht to become an island. Over 10,000 people died in the flood. [ Union of Dordrecht ] Dordrecht around 1565, by Jacob van Deventer In 1572, four years into the Dutch Revolt, representatives of all the cities of Holland, with the exception of Amsterdam, as well as the Watergeuzen, represented by William II de la Marck, gathered in Dordrecht to hold the Eerste Vrije Statenvergadering ( &quot; First Assembly of the Free States &quot; ), also known as the Unie van Dordrecht ( &quot; Union of Dordrecht &quot; ). This secret meeting, called by the city of Dordrecht, was a rebellious act since only King Philip II or his stadtholder, at that time the Duke of Alva, were allowed to call a meeting of the states. During the meeting, the organization and financing of the rebellion against the Spanish occupation was discussed, Phillip II was unanimously denounced and William of Orange was chosen as the new stadtholder and recognized as the official leader of the revolt. Orange was promised financial support of his struggle against the Spanish and at his own request, freedom of religion was declared in all of Holland. The gathering is regarded as the first important step towards the free and independent Dutch Republic. { http://cms.dordrecht.nl/dordt?waxtrapp=htvrnDsHaKnPvBJWH } Other gatherings such as the Union of Brussels (1577) and the Union of Utrecht (1579) paved the way for official independence of the Netherlands, declared in the Act of Abjuration in 1581. The Union of Dordrecht was held in an Augustinian monastery, nowadays simply called het Hof ( &quot; the Court &quot; ). The room in which the meeting was held is called de Statenzaal ( &quot; The Hall of States &quot; ) and features a stained glass window in which the coats of arms of the twelve cities that were present at the meeting can be seen. [ Synod of Dordrecht ] { Synod of Dordrecht 1618/19 } [ Synod of Dort ] In 1618/1619, an important religious meeting took place in Dordrecht, called the Synod of Dordrecht. It settled a theological dispute between the orthodox Calvinists and the liberal Arminians that had brought the country on the brink of civil war. The Arminians were defeated, resulting in the formulation of the Canons of Dort. [ The Patriots movement ] From 1780 to 1787, Dordrecht was home to the Patriots faction which intended to remove the hereditary Stadtholder position held by the House of Orange-Nassau. The Netherlands was after all a republic de jure. Soon after, more cities followed and William V fled from Holland. But his brother-in-law, King Frederick William II of Prussia, came to the aid of William V and on 18 September 1787, Dordrecht capitulated to Prussian troops. The Patriots were defeated and Willem V was restored in his position as Stadtholder. [ Modern history ] { Japanese battleship Kaiyō Maru was launched at Dordrecht in 1865. She was the largest wooden warship ever launched from a Dutch yard. } In the 18th century, the importance of Dordrecht began to wane, and Rotterdam became the main city in the region. Yet throughout the centuries, Dordrecht held a key position in the defense of Holland. It hosted an army division well into the 20th century. During the mobilization of August 1939, infantry and artillery were sent to Dordrecht to defend the island.When the Germans invaded the Netherlands on the 10th of May 1940 German paratroopers landed in Dordrecht. After fierce fighting they overtook the bridges Dordrecht-Moerdijk and Dordrecht-Zwijndrecht.Many buildings in Dordrecht were destroyed. At the end of the Second World War, during the winter of 1944–45, Dordrecht and its surroundings were in the middle between the opposing armies. The border between occupied and liberated regions ran along the Hollands Diep.Dordrecht was finally liberated by the Canadian Army In 1970, the municipality Dubbeldam (then ca. 10,000 inhabitants) and the southern part of the municipality of Sliedrecht were incorporated into Dordrecht, making Dordrecht Island one municipality.

This name originates from an old folk story. Import of meat or cattle was taxed in the 17th century. To avoid having to pay, two men dressed up a sheep they had bought outside the city walls, attempting to disguise it as a man. The sheep was discovered because it bleated as the three men (two men and one sheep) passed through the city wall gate. There is a special monument of a man and his son trying to hold a sheep disguised as a man between them, that refers to this legend. The logo of Dordrecht’s professional football club FC Dordrecht includes the head of a ram and its supporters are known to sing Wij zijn de Dordtse schapenkoppen (we are the Dorsts sheep heads) during matches. There is also a cookie called Schapenkop (sheep head) which is a specialty of Dordrecht. There are many more legends about Dordrecht. One of them is about Saint Sura, a young woman who planned on building an entire church with only three coins in her purse. She was murdered because of her supposed wealth. Another legend is about the house called de Onbeschaamde (the Unembarrassed). It is about the three brothers Van Beveren who each wanted to build a house and decided to hold a bet on who dared to place the most risky statue on their façade. One of the brothers, Abraham van Beveren, placed a naked little boy on his façade. However, the house that supposedly won has an empty façade today because, according to the story, the statue was so risky that it was removed. A well known saying about Dordrecht is Hoe dichter bij Dordt, hoe rotter het wordt (the closer to Dordrecht, the more rotten it gets). The previous mayor Noorland added to that; maar ben je er eenmaal in, dan heb je het prima naar je zin (but once you’re in it, you’re perfectly content). The saying can probably be explained as follows; traffic used to go by water and whoever came close to Dordrecht was obliged, according to staple right, to display their merchandise for a couple of days before being allowed to sail on. This caused loss of time and caused products to become rotten. Another explanation is derived from Bommel is rommel, bij Tiel is niet viel en hoe dichter bij Dordt hoe rotter het wordt which is supposed to be said by farmers describing the bad quality of the land close to the rivers Maas and Waal, only suitable for harvesting reed. [ Nature ] The Sliedrechtse Biesbosch, east of Dordrecht, and the Dordtse Biesbosch, south of Dordrecht, together form the Hollandse Biesbosch which is a part of the national park the Biesbosch, one of the largest national parks in the Netherlands and one of the last freshwater tide areas in Europe. The Dordtse Biesbosch has several recreational areas that are used for walking, rowing and swimming. [ Dordts ] Dordts is a dialect of Dutch traditionally spoken by the working class of Dordrecht. It is categorized under the Hollandic accents but also has characteristics of Zeelandic and Brabantian. Typical features of Dordts are: Using the diminutive suffix -ie or -tie in cases where standard Dutch uses -je. (e.g. Standard Dutch: appeltje (“little apple”) Dordts: appeltie) Words borrowed from Brabantian such as akkerdere (“lit. to knock or to fit, fig. “to get along”) The Dutch diphthongs ei and ui tend to be pronounced more like èè and öö. Recently, the ei-sound has started to be pronounced more like ai. In the 20th century, Dordts has slowly started to disappear as more and more people have started speaking standard Dutch. The strongest Dorts dialect is nowadays found in the working class neighborhoods bordering the city centre. [ Other ] On 14 November 1992 and again on 12 November 2011, the official arrival of the popular holiday figure Sinterklaas was held in Dordrecht and broadcasted on national television. [ Economy ] Harbor area of Dordrecht, seen from the Leeuwenhoekweg The current economy of Dordrecht is based on ship building, wood industry, and steel industry. The city has the sixth largest sea port in the Netherlands. One of the largest employers on Dordrecht Island is DuPont de Nemours (Nederland) B.V. It has 9 factories here with a workforce of 900 people. Together with Zwijndrecht, Papendrecht, and Sliedrecht (the &quot; &apos;&apos;Drecht&apos;&apos; Cities &quot; ), Dordrecht is planning a new ambitious vision to revitalize the region&apos;s economy, moving from industry to more business services.
