Lake Athabasca is also known to have substantial oil deposits in its tar sands. [ History ] The name in the Dene language originally referred only to the large delta formed by the confluence the Athabasca River at the southwest corner of the lake. In 1791, Philip Turnor, cartographer for the Hudson’s Bay Company, wrote in his journal, &quot; low swampy ground on the South side with a few willows growing upon it, from which the Lake in general takes its name Athapison in the Southern Cree tongue which signifies open country such as lakes with willows and grass growing about them &quot;. Peter Fidler originally recorded the name for the river in 1790 as the Great Arabuska. By 1801, the name had gained a closer spelling to the current name—Athapaskow Lake. By 1820, George Simpson referred to both the lake and the river as &quot; Athabasca &quot;. [ Geography ] Lake Athabasca, Canada The lake covers [ 7850 km2 sqmi on ], is [ 283 km mi on ] long, has a maximum width of [ 50 km mi on ], and a maximum depth of [ 124 m ft on ], and holds [ 204 km3 cumi on ] of water, making it the largest and deepest lake in both Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the eighth largest in Canada.

Fort Chipewyan, one of the oldest European settlements in Alberta, is located on the western shore of the lake, where the Rivière des Rochers drains the lake and flows toward Slave River, beginning its northward journey along the eastern boundary of Wood Buffalo National Park. Fidler Point on the north shore of Lake Athabasca is named for Peter Fidler, a surveyor and map maker for the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company. { Place Names - Faria Creek - Friock Creek } [ Development and environment ] Uranium and gold mining along the northern shore resulted in the birth of Uranium City, Saskatchewan, which was home to the mine workers and their families. While the last mine closed in the 1980s, the effects of mining operations have heavily contaminated the northern shores. The Lake Athabasca Sand Dunes, the largest active sand dunes in the world north of 58°, are adjacent to the southern shore. After a long struggle with government bureaucracy and opposition from mining companies, the dunes were designated a &quot; Provincial Wilderness Park &quot; in 1992. Lake Athabasca contains 23 species of fish, with a world record lake trout of [ 46.3 kg lb on ] having been caught from its depths in 1961 by means of a gillnet.
