The population was 787 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Alexandria Metropolitan Statistical Area. Founded in 1712, even before New Orleans, Montgomery is situated on U.S. Highway 71 in the northwesternmost section of Grant Parish close to the boundary of Natchitoches and Winn parishes. It is located east of the Red River. In the 1950s, Montgomery was known as one of the smaller communities in the state which could draw considerable crowds to political gatherings. William J. &quot; Bill &quot; Dodd, veteran Louisiana politician, in his memoirs Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics, recalls a 1955 gathering in which he &quot; eulogized &quot; Huey Long, Earl Long, and attorney general candidate Jack P.F. Gremillion. Dodd satirized Gremillion&apos;s World War II record: &quot; Why he almost got killed himself when an enemy shell plowed into one of his most vital organs; if you don&apos;t believe Jack Gremillion earned his Purple Heart, he will show you the scars he has to prove it. &quot; The scars were on Gremillion&apos;s rear end, much to the embarrassment of the successful candidate. From Montgomery, the Long train headed to the parish seat of Colfax. { William J. &quot; Bill &quot; Dodd, Peapatch Politics:The Ear Long Era in Louisiana Politics, Claitor&apos;s Publishing, 1991, p. 179 } [ Geography ] Montgomery is located at [ 31 39 58 N 92 53 12 W type:city ] (31.666001, -92.886539) [ 1 ] and has an elevation of [ 154 ft 1 ] [ 3 ].
