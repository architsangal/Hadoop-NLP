[ 2012–13 ECHL season East Coast Hockey League.svg 150px Ice hockey 1988 23 United States Florida Everblades (tie) Hampton Roads Admirals and South Carolina Stingrays (3) ] The ECHL (formerly the East Coast Hockey League) is a mid-level professional ice hockey league based in Princeton, New Jersey with teams scattered across the United States. It is generally regarded as a tier below the American Hockey League. The ECHL and the AHL are the only minor leagues recognized by the collective bargaining agreement between the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players&apos; Association, meaning any player signed to an entry-level NHL contract and designated for assignment must report to a club either in the AHL or the ECHL. [ Collective Bargaining Agreement between National Hockey League and National Hockey League Players&apos; Association NHL and NHLPA July 22, 2005 http://www.nhl.com/cba/2005-CBA.pdf November 19, 2010 ] Additionally, the league&apos;s players are represented by the Professional Hockey Players&apos; Association in negotiations with the ECHL itself. 26 of the 30 National Hockey League teams have affiliations with the ECHL, { http://www.echl.com/nhlahl-affiliations-s12375 } and 490 players have advanced from the ECHL to play in the NHL. { http://www.echl.com/alumni-s12397 } The current ECHL Champion is the Florida Everblades. { http://www.winknews.com/Local-Florida/2012-05-23/Everblades-win-first-ever-Kelly-Cup } [ History ] The league, which combined teams from the defunct Atlantic Coast Hockey League and All-American Hockey League, began play as the East Coast Hockey League in 1988 with 5 teams —the (Winston-Salem, North) Carolina Thunderbirds (now the Wheeling Nailers ); the Erie Panthers (folded after 2011 as the Victoria Salmon Kings ); the Johnstown Chiefs (now the Greenville Road Warriors ); the Knoxville Cherokees (ceased operations as the Pee Dee Pride after 2005; folded after 2009 following failed relocation efforts); and the Virginia Lancers (now the Utah Grizzlies ).

Alaska, Bakersfield, Fresno, Idaho, Las Vegas, Long Beach and San Diego began play in the 2003–04 season as expansion teams. In a change reflective of the league&apos;s now-nationwide presence, the East Coast Hockey League shortened its name to the orphan initialism ECHL on May 19, 2003. The ECHL reached its largest size to date (31 teams) that season before being reduced to 28 teams for the 2004 –05 season. The league, because of geographical anomalies, has used unbalanced conferences and divisions, making for some extremely varied playoff formats and limited interconference play. Due to travel costs, the league has attempted to placate owners in keeping those costs down, which has led to the sometimes-odd playoff structures. The ECHL has attempted to be more tech-friendly to its fans. Some improvements on the league&apos;s website have included a new schedule and statistics engine powered by League Stat, Inc. (introduced in 2006 ), internet radio coverage for most teams, and pay-per view broadcasting of ECHL games through B2 Networks (a subsidiary of America One Broadcasting ). In 2008, the league introduced the ECHL toolbar for internet browsers which gave users short cut access to statistics, scores, transactions, and news updates.

The former American Conference (comprising eleven East Coast and Midwest teams) was renamed the Eastern Conference, while the National Conference (consisting of 8 West Coast teams, including the league&apos;s only Canadian team at the time), was re-designated the Western Conference. Within the Eastern Conference, the East Division was renamed the Atlantic Division, and the Western Conference&apos;s former West Division was dubbed the Mountain Division.
