Permanent settlement had begun in 1838. The early economy was based on mining and smelting iron, but this industry did not become significant until about 1843. Clinton Prison (currently known as the Clinton Correctional Facility ) was opened in 1845 to employ convicts to work in the iron industry. As a maximum security facility, it currently houses long-term prisoners and is one of the largest prisons in the state. From 1900 to 1972, Dannemora also contained the Dannemora Hospital for the Criminally Insane (also known by other names). This facility was used afterwards for a variety of prison programs by the Department of Corrections. As a result, Dannemora has become a synonym among many in New York for the place where the criminally insane go.
