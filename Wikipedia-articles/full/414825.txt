[ June 2012 ] [ June 2012 ] [ the Northern Ireland politician the footballer David Burnside (footballer) ] [ February 2008 ] [ 1951 08 24 yes ] { Ballymoney, } { Co. Antrim, } { Northern Ireland } { British } { Ulster Unionist Party } { Coleraine Academical Institution Coleraine Academical Institution } { http://www.uup.org/ } David Wilson Boyd Burnside (born 24 August 1951) is a Northern Ireland politician, and was Ulster Unionist Party Member of Parliament for South Antrim. In the 1970s Burnside served as Press Officer for the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party, and he unsuccessfully contested North Antrim for the party at the Northern Ireland Assembly election, 1973. [ June 2010 ] After the collapse of Vanguard he joined the Ulster Unionists, but took a back seat from politics for many years while working as a prominent public relations consultant based in London which led him to set up his own PR company. { http://dbapr.co.uk/_wsn/page2.html } [ British Airways ] In 1984 David Burnside was recruited by the British Airways Chairman Lord King to become the company&apos;s head of public relations. In this role Burnside is widely acknowledged [ January 2008 ] to have become one of the most powerful PR men in Britain, speaking for King, administering a £5,000,000 budget and receiving numerous PR awards both in the UK and around the world. His success is perhaps overshadowed by the nature of his departure. British Airways was witnessing the emergence of a potentially strong rival, Richard Branson &apos;s Virgin Atlantic. Virgin, which began with one route and one Boeing 747 in 1984 was beginning to emerge as a serious threat on some of BA&apos;s most lucrative routes. Following Virgin&apos;s highly publicized mission of mercy to Iraq to fly home hostages who had been held by Saddam Hussein in 1991, Lord King is reported to have told Burnside and CEO Colin Marshall to &quot; do something about Branson &quot;. This began the campaign of &quot; dirty tricks &quot;, masterminded [ January 2008 ] by Burnside, which ended in Branson suing King and British Airways for libel in 1992. King countersued Branson and the case went to trial in 1993. British Airways, faced with likely defeat, settled the case giving £500,000 to Branson and a further £110,000 to his airline; further, BA was to pay the legal fees of up to £3,000,000. [ January 2008 ] Tom Bower &apos;s biography of Virgin&apos;s chief, Branson, published in 2000 gives a rather different perspective on this matter. It was an article written by Burnside (given legal clearance) in BA News, the company&apos;s in house newsletter, that prompted Branson&apos;s legal action. In January 1993, following the settlement and investigations by BA&apos;s lawyers the board decided to sack Burnside. He was awarded a settlement of approximately £400,000 and free first class travel on BA for four years.

Willie McCrea. However he reversed this defeat in the 2001 general election. Along with Jeffrey Donaldson (MP) and the Rev. Martin Smyth (MP), Burnside became an outspoken critic of his party leader, David Trimble &apos;s support for the Good Friday Agreement, arguing that the Provisional IRA &apos;s slow pace of decommissioning its arms meant that Sinn Féin, the political wing of the IRA, should not be allowed to serve in the power-sharing government. On 23 June 2003, Burnside, Donaldson and Smyth resigned the UUP whip in the House of Commons, launching a strong attack on Trimble&apos;s leadership. { &quot; UUP rebels to face discipline &quot;, BBC News, 26 June 2003. } The trio successfully fought off attempts to discipline them using the courts and in November 2003 both Burnside and Donaldson were elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, Burnside declined to follow Donaldson when he resigned from the Ulster Unionist Party in December 2003. In 2005 he lost his Westminster Parliamentary seat. Burnside successfully retained his Assembly seat in March 2007. Supporters of Burnside see him as a potential future leader of the Ulster Unionist Party; however, he declined to contest the 2005 leadership election. Burnside resigned as an Assembly Member in June 2009 to concentrate on his business interests. His seat was taken by Antrim councillor Danny Kinahan. He currently is mulling a return to politics, maybe to his former position. [ Rangers Football Club ] Burnside was linked to a potential Rangers takeover in 2007 { &quot; Burnside not put off Rangers bid &quot;, BBC Sport,5 March 2007. } but nothing came of it. There was not enough investment available for the move. [ References ] [ Sources ] Gregory, Martyn. Dirty Tricks: British Airways&apos; Secret War Against Virgin Atlantic. London: Virgin, 2000.
