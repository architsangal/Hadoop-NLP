Retrieved 2011-11-08. } is an English socialist columnist, author and comedian. A stand-up comedian known for his left-wing beliefs (he was a long-standing member of the Socialist Workers Party before he resigned in 2007), he has made many appearances on radio and television shows as a guest panellist, and has written regular columns in printed media. He is perhaps best known for presenting The Mark Steel Lectures, The Mark Steel Revolution, The Mark Steel Solution, and Mark Steel&apos;s in Town. [ Early life ] Steel was adopted a few days after he was born. [ The Week with George Galloway 4/11/2011 ] He grew up in Swanley, Kent. He was expelled from Swanley Comprehensive School for attending a cricket course at the age of 15, [ November 2010 ] and went on to work in a garage. From there he went on to make his first public performance as a poet. In the late 1970s his father suffered a mental breakdown and was placed into care at Stonehouse Hospital. The shabby conditions of the home reinforced Steel&apos;s political beliefs. [ Steel Mark Reasons to be Cheerful Scribner UK 2001 0-7432-0804-8 ] [ Career ] Steel has given varying accounts of his early life: he became bored with constantly being asked how he had started in comedy and took to telling the questioner the first thing that came into his head. He is often described as having worked as a television repair man [ Open2.net: How did you get into comedy? http://www.open2.net/marksteel/o2interview.htm Open University 2008-10-18 ] but confesses that he has no technical ability whatsoever. He worked the comedy circuit for several years, and then in 1992 presented a satirical radio show The Mark Steel Solution on BBC Radio 5, consisting of half-hour monologues which offered solutions to social problems. It ran to four series. It&apos;s Not a Runner Bean, a comic autobiography, was published in 1996, and this led to a column in The Guardian. Steel wrote a column for The Guardian between 1996 and 1999. He was sacked by that newspaper, according to him because The Guardian wanted to &quot; realign towards Tony Blair &quot; - though The Guardian denies this. In 2000 he started writing a weekly column for The Independent, which appears in the Wednesday Opinion Column. He has written and performed several radio and television series for the BBC, and authored several books, as detailed below. In 2005 he toured the UK and Ireland, where he discussed the French revolution in a light-hearted style. [ Personal life ] Steel is a supporter of Crystal Palace F.C. and Kent County Cricket Club and enjoys watching both play on occasion. He was interviewed by Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special during the South Africa series, giving an interview on his love of cricket. { Interview on BBC&apos;s } { Test Match Special, 1 August 2008 } He has a son (Elliot) and a daughter (Eloise) from a relationship, but he and his partner separated in 2006.

His anger and frustration at society&apos;s injustices were vented by political protests, punk rock and poetry. Seeing the Soviet Union as &quot; shit &quot;, and state capitalist rather than truly socialist, Steel joined the Socialist Workers Party rather than the Communist Party. He attended marches, strikes and demonstrations, and was present at the death of Blair Peach. In the early &apos;80s he also persuaded his mother to allow striking steelworkers to spend a night in the Steel residence. His political activism continued throughout the decade, from the miners&apos; strike through to the Poll Tax Riots. During this time he moved into a squat with his old friend Mick Hannan, before taking up residence in a flat. In 2000 Steel took part in the London Assembly elections on behalf of the London Socialist Alliance (part of the Socialist Alliance ) in the Croydon and Sutton constituency; he received 1,823 votes (1.5 per cent of the vote). In 2007 he left the SWP and justified his decision in his book What&apos;s Going On? In the book he wrote that he left the party because whilst the membership base had become smaller and smaller, the members that remained became increasingly deluded regarding the size and relevance of the organisation. He also condemned the manner in which, at a time when there was broad public support for socialist ideals, increasingly bitter and futile in-fighting on the left made political success impossible. Alex Callinicos, International Secretary of the SWP, reviewed the book in the Socialist Review, arguing that it &quot; evinces a kind of grandiose ignorance &quot; and that &quot; the only principle one can detect here is that the SWP is always in the wrong &quot;.

Callinicos Alex September 2008 Socialist Review 16 November 2010 ] Literary critic Nicholas Lezard praised the book in The Guardian, particularly for its discussion of the break-up of Steel&apos;s relationship, which &quot; gives it a poignancy and depth which at its outset one might not have expected &quot;.
