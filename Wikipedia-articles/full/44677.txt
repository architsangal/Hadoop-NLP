[ Shoback edited by David G. Gardner, Dolores Greenspan&apos;s basic &amp; clinical endocrinology 2011 McGraw-Hill Medical New York 0-07-162243-8 Chapter 17 9th ] This high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger). The three main types of diabetes mellitus (DM) are: Type  1 DM results from the body&apos;s failure to produce insulin, and presently requires the person to inject insulin. (Also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or &quot; juvenile &quot; diabetes) Type  2 DM results from insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency. (Formerly referred to as noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or &quot; adult-onset &quot; diabetes) Gestational diabetes is when pregnant women, who have never had diabetes before, have a high blood glucose level during pregnancy. It may precede development of type  2 DM. Other forms of diabetes mellitus include congenital diabetes, which is due to genetic defects of insulin secretion, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, steroid diabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids, and several forms of monogenic diabetes. All forms of diabetes have been treatable since insulin became available in 1921, and type  2 diabetes may be controlled with medications. Both types 1 and 2 are chronic conditions that usually cannot be cured. Pancreas transplant s have been tried with limited success in type  1 DM; gastric bypass surgery has been successful in many with morbid obesity and type  2 DM. Gestational diabetes usually resolves after delivery. Diabetes without proper treatments can cause many complications. Acute complications include hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, and diabetic retinopathy (retinal damage). Adequate treatment of diabetes is thus important, as well as blood pressure control and lifestyle factors such as smoking cessation and maintaining a healthy body weight. Globally, [ 2010 on ], an estimated 285  million people have type  2 diabetes, making up about 90  percent of all diabetes cases. [ Classification ] [ Williams textbook of endocrinology Elsevier/Saunders Philadelphia 978-1-4377-0324-5 1371–1435 12th ] [ 10.1383/medc.30.1.1.28264 ] Comparison of type 1 and 2 diabetes Feature Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Onset Sudden Gradual Age at onset Mostly in children Mostly in adults Body habitus Thin or normal Often obese Ketoacidosis Common Rare Autoantibodies Usually present Absent Endogenous insulin Low or absent Normal, decreased or increased Concordance in identical twin s 50% 90% Prevalence ~10% ~90% Diabetes mellitus is classified into four broad categories: type  1, type  2, gestational diabetes and &quot; other specific types &quot;. The &quot; other specific types &quot; are a collection of a few dozen individual causes. The term &quot; diabetes &quot;, without qualification, usually refers to diabetes mellitus. The rare disease diabetes insipidus has similar symptoms as diabetes mellitus, but without disturbances in the sugar metabolism (insipidus means &quot; without taste &quot; in Latin). The term &quot; type  1 diabetes &quot; has replaced several former terms, including childhood-onset diabetes, juvenile diabetes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Likewise, the term &quot; type  2 diabetes &quot; has replaced several former terms, including adult-onset diabetes, obesity-related diabetes, and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Beyond these two types, there is no agreed-upon standard nomenclature. [ Type 1 diabetes ] [ Diabetes mellitus type 1 ] Type  1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss of the insulin-producing beta cell s of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency. This type can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic. The majority of type  1 diabetes is of the immune-mediated nature, in which beta cell loss is a T-cell -mediated autoimmune attack. [ Rother KI Diabetes treatment—bridging the divide The New England Journal of Medicine 356 15 1499–501 2007 April 17429082 10.1056/NEJMp078030 ] There is no known preventive measure against type  1 diabetes, which causes approximately 10% of diabetes mellitus cases in North America and Europe. Most affected people are otherwise healthy and of a healthy weight when onset occurs. Sensitivity and responsiveness to insulin are usually normal, especially in the early stages. Type  1 diabetes can affect children or adults, but was traditionally termed &quot; juvenile diabetes &quot; because a majority of these diabetes cases were in children. &quot; Brittle &quot; diabetes, also known as unstable diabetes or labile diabetes, is a term that was traditionally used to describe to dramatic and recurrent swings in glucose levels, often occurring for no apparent reason in insulin -dependent diabetes. This term, however, has no biologic basis and should not be used.

These phenomena are believed to occur no more frequently than in 1% to 2% of persons with type  1 diabetes. [ Dorner M, Pinget M, Brogard JM Essential labile diabetes German MMW Munch Med Wochenschr 119 19 671–4 1977 May 406527 ] [ Type 2 diabetes ] [ Diabetes mellitus type 2 ] Type  2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance, which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion. The defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the insulin receptor. However, the specific defects are not known. Diabetes mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. Type  2 diabetes is the most common type. In the early stage of type  2, the predominant abnormality is reduced insulin sensitivity. At this stage, hyperglycemia can be reversed by a variety of measures and medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce glucose production by the liver. [ Gestational diabetes ] [ Gestational diabetes ] Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) resembles type  2 diabetes in several respects, involving a combination of relatively inadequate insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2%–5% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after delivery. Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. About 20%–50% of affected women develop type  2 diabetes later in life. Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother. Risks to the baby include macrosomia (high birth weight), congenital cardiac and central nervous system anomalies, and skeletal muscle malformations. Increased fetal insulin may inhibit fetal surfactant production and cause respiratory distress syndrome. Hyperbilirubinemia may result from red blood cell destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment. Labor induction may be indicated with decreased placental function. A Caesarean section may be performed if there is marked fetal distress or an increased risk of injury associated with macrosomia, such as shoulder dystocia. A 2008 study completed in the U.S. found the number of American women entering pregnancy with pre-existing diabetes is increasing. In fact, the rate of diabetes in expectant mothers has more than doubled in the past six years. [ Lawrence JM, Contreras R, Chen W, Sacks DA Trends in the prevalence of preexisting diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus among a racially/ethnically diverse population of pregnant women, 1999–2005 Diabetes Care 31 5 899–904 2008 May 18223030 10.2337/dc07-2345 ] This is particularly problematic as diabetes raises the risk of complications during pregnancy, as well as increasing the potential for the children of diabetic mothers to become diabetic in the future. [ Other types ] Prediabetes indicates a condition that occurs when a person&apos;s blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type  2 DM.Many people destined to develop type  2 DM spend many years in a state of prediabetes which has been termed &quot; America&apos;s largest healthcare epidemic. &quot; [ Handelsman Yehuda MD A Doctor&apos;s Diagnosis: Prediabetes Power of Prevention 1 2 2009, ] [ 10–11 July 2009 ] Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is a condition in which type  1 DM develops in adults. Adults with LADA are frequently initially misdiagnosed as having type  2 DM, based on age rather than etiology. Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body&apos;s tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin levels are normal, which is what separates it from type  2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon. Genetic mutations ( autosomal or mitochondrial ) can lead to defects in beta cell function. Abnormal insulin action may also have been genetically determined in some cases. Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis ). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of insulin-antagonistic hormone s can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells. The ICD -10 (1992) diagnostic entity, malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus (MRDM or MMDM, ICD-10 code E12), was deprecated by the World Health Organization when the current taxonomy was introduced in 1999. [ World Health Organisation Definition, Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus and its Complications 1999 http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/WHO_NCD_NCS_99.2.pdf PDF ] [ Signs and symptoms ] Overview of the most significant symptoms of diabetes The classical symptoms of untreated diabetes are loss of weight, polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger). [ Cooke DW, Plotnick L Type 1 diabetes mellitus in pediatrics Pediatr Rev 29 11 374–84; quiz 385 2008 November 18977856 10.1542/pir.29-11-374 ] Symptoms may develop rapidly (weeks or months) in type  1 diabetes, while they usually develop much more slowly and may be subtle or absent in type  2 diabetes. Prolonged high blood glucose can cause glucose absorption in the lens of the eye, which leads to changes in its shape, resulting in vision changes. Blurred vision is a common complaint leading to a diabetes diagnosis; type  1 should always be suspected in cases of rapid vision change, whereas with type  2 change is generally more gradual, but should still be suspected [ June 2011 ]. A number of skin rashes that can occur in diabetes are collectively known as diabetic dermadromes. [ Diabetic emergencies ] People (usually with type  1 diabetes) may also present with diabetic ketoacidosis, a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by the smell of acetone, a rapid, deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, and altered states of consciousness. A rare but equally severe possibility is hyperosmolar nonketotic state, which is more common in type  2 diabetes and is mainly the result of dehydration. [ Complications ] [ Complications of diabetes mellitus ] All forms of diabetes increase the risk of long-term complications. These typically develop after many years (10–20), but may be the first symptom in those who have otherwise not received a diagnosis before that time. The major long-term complications relate to damage to blood vessel s. Diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease. [ Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60484-9 Diabetes mellitus, fasting blood glucose concentration, and risk of vascular disease: A collaborative meta-analysis of 102 prospective studies The Lancet 375 9733 2215–22 2010 ] The main &quot; macrovascular &quot; diseases (related to atherosclerosis of larger arteries) are ischemic heart disease ( angina and myocardial infarction ), stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Diabetes also causes &quot; microvascular &quot; complications—damage to the small blood vessels. [ Boussageon R Effect of intensive glucose lowering treatment on all cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and microvascular events in type  2 diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials BMJ 343 d4169 2011 21791495 3144314 10.1136/bmj.d4169, Bejan-Angoulvant T Saadatian-Elahi M 3 Lafont S. Bergeonneau C. Kassai B. Erpeldinger S. Wright J. M. Gueyffier F. ] Diabetic retinopathy, which affects blood vessel formation in the retina of the eye, can lead to visual symptoms, reduced vision, and potentially blindness. Diabetic nephropathy, the impact of diabetes on the kidneys, can lead to scarring changes in the kidney tissue, loss of small or progressively larger amounts of protein in the urine, and eventually chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Diabetic neuropathy is the impact of diabetes on the nervous system, most commonly causing numbness, tingling and pain in the feet and also increasing the risk of skin damage due to altered sensation. Together with vascular disease in the legs, neuropathy contributes to the risk of diabetes-related foot problems (such as diabetic foot ulcer s ) that can be difficult to treat and occasionally require amputation. [ Causes ] The cause of diabetes depends on the type. Type  1 diabetes is partly inherited, and then triggered by certain infections, with some evidence pointing at Coxsackie B4 virus. A genetic element in individual susceptibility to some of these triggers has been traced to particular HLA genotype s (i.e., the genetic &quot; self &quot; identifiers relied upon by the immune system). However, even in those who have inherited the susceptibility, type  1 DM seems to require an environ mental trigger. Type  2 diabetes is due primarily to lifestyle factors and genetics.

Its release is triggered by food, chiefly food containing absorbable glucose. Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells (primarily muscle and fat cells, but not central nervous system cells). Therefore, deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of its receptors plays a central role in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Humans are capable of digesting some carbohydrates, in particular those most common in food; starch, and some disaccharides such as sucrose, are converted within a few hours to simpler forms, most notably the monosaccharide glucose, the principal carbohydrate energy source used by the body. The rest are passed on for processing by gut flora largely in the colon. Insulin is released into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, in response to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating. Insulin is used by about two-thirds of the body&apos;s cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for storage. Insulin is also the principal control signal for conversion of glucose to glycogen for internal storage in liver and muscle cells. Lowered glucose levels result both in the reduced release of insulin from the β-cells and in the reverse conversion of glycogen to glucose when glucose levels fall. This is mainly controlled by the hormone glucagon, which acts in the opposite manner to insulin. Glucose thus forcibly produced from internal liver cell stores (as glycogen) re-enters the bloodstream; muscle cells lack the necessary export mechanism. Normally, liver cells do this when the level of insulin is low (which normally correlates with low levels of blood glucose). Higher insulin levels increase some anabolic ( &quot; building up &quot; ) processes, such as cell growth and duplication, protein synthesis, and fat storage. Insulin (or its lack) is the principal signal in converting many of the bidirectional processes of metabolism from a catabolic to an anabolic direction, and vice versa. In particular, a low insulin level is the trigger for entering or leaving ketosis (the fat-burning metabolic phase). If the amount of insulin available is insufficient, if cells respond poorly to the effects of insulin (insulin insensitivity or resistance), or if the insulin itself is defective, then glucose will not have its usual effect, so it will not be absorbed properly by those body cells that require it, nor will it be stored appropriately in the liver and muscles. The net effect is persistent high levels of blood glucose, poor protein synthesis, and other metabolic derangements, such as acidosis. When the glucose concentration in the blood is raised beyond its renal threshold (about 10  mmol/L, although this may be altered in certain conditions, such as pregnancy), reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubuli is incomplete, and part of the glucose remains in the urine ( glycosuria ). This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production ( polyuria ) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume will be replaced osmotically from water held in body cells and other body compartments, causing dehydration and increased thirst. [ Diagnosis ] [ Glyclated hemoglobin Glucose tolerance test ] Diabetes mellitus is characterized by recurrent or persistent hyperglycemia, and is diagnosed by demonstrating any one of the following: [ American Diabetes Association http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/Supplement_1/S3.full &quot; Diabetes Care &quot; January 2010 2010-01-29 ] Fasting plasma glucose level ≥  7.0  mmol/l (126  mg/dl) Plasma glucose ≥  11.1  mmol/l (200  mg/dL) two hours after a 75  g oral glucose load as in a glucose tolerance test Symptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose ≥  11.1  mmol/l (200  mg/dl) Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1C) ≥  6.5% A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of the above methods on a different day. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test. [ Saydah SH, Miret M, Sung J, Varas C, Gause D, Brancati FL Postchallenge hyperglycemia and mortality in a national sample of U.S. adults Diabetes Care 24 8 1397–402 2001 August 11473076 10.2337/diacare.24.8.1397 ] According to the current definition, two fasting glucose measurements above 126  mg/dl (7.0  mmol/l) is considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus. People with fasting glucose levels from 110 to 125  mg/dl (6.1 to 6.9  mmol/l) are considered to have impaired fasting glucose.

Of these two prediabetic states, the latter in particular is a major risk factor for progression to full-blown diabetes mellitus, as well as cardiovascular disease.

Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal ( &quot; euglycemia &quot; ) as possible, without causing hypoglycemia. This can usually be accomplished with diet, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type  1 diabetes, oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type  2 diabetes). Patient education, understanding, and participation is vital, since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.

The greatest increase in prevalence is, however, expected to occur in Asia and Africa, where most patients will probably be found by 2030. The increase in incidence in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, perhaps most importantly a &quot; Western-style &quot; diet.

[ United Kingdom ] About 3.8  million people in the United Kingdom have diabetes mellitus, but the charity Diabetes U.K. have made predictions that that could become high as 6.2  million by 2035/2036. Diabetes U.K. have also predicted that the National Health Service could be spending as much as 16.9  billion pounds on diabetes mellitus by 2035, a figure that means that the National Health Service could be spending as much as 17% of its budget on diabetes treatment by 2035.

The term &quot; diabetes &quot; or &quot; to pass through &quot; was first used in 230  BCE by the Greek Appollonius of Memphis. The disease was rare during the time of the Roman empire, with Galen commenting he had only seen two cases during his career. Type  1 and type  2 diabetes where identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400-500  AD with type  1 associated with youth and type  2 with being overweight. The term &quot; mellitus &quot; or &quot; from honey &quot; was added by the Briton John Rolle in the late 1700s to separate the condition from diabetes insipidus, which is also associated with frequent urination. While many measure where tried, effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century, when Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert Best developed insulin in 1921 and 1922. This was followed by the development of the long-acting insulin NPH in the 1940s. [ Etymology ] The word diabetes ( [ icon ˌ d aɪ. ə ˈ b iː t iː z ] or [ ˌ d aɪ. ə ˈ b iː t ɨ s ] ) comes from Latin diabētēs, which in turn comes from Ancient Greek διαβήτης (diabētēs) which literally means &quot; a passer through; a siphon. &quot; { Oxford English Dictionary. diabetes. Retrieved 2011-06-10. } Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia ( fl. 1st century CE ) used that word, with the intended meaning &quot; excessive discharge of urine &quot;, as the name for the disease.

Diabetes, Doctors and Dogs: An exhibition on Diabetes and Endocrinology by the College Library for the 43rd St. Andrew&apos;s Day Festival Symposium 2011 http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/library/exhibitions/diabetes/ ] Ultimately, the word comes from Greek διαβαίνειν (diabainein), meaning &quot; to pass through, &quot; which is composed of δια- (dia-), meaning &quot; through &quot; and βαίνειν (bainein), meaning &quot; to go &quot;. The word &quot; diabetes &quot; is first recorded in English, in the form diabete, in a medical text written around 1425. The word mellitus ( [ m ɨ ˈ l aɪ t ə s ] or [ ˈ m ɛ l ɨ t ə s ] ) comes from the classical Latin word mellītus, meaning &quot; mellite &quot; { Oxford English Dictionary. mellite. Retrieved 2011-06-10. } (i.e. sweetened with honey; honey-sweet [ MyEtimology. mellitus. http://www.myetymology.com/latin/mellitus.html 2011-06-10 ] ). The Latin word comes from mell-, which comes from mel, meaning &quot; honey &quot;; sweetness; pleasant thing, and the suffix -ītus, whose meaning is the same as that of the English suffix &quot; -ite &quot;. { Oxford English Dictionary. -ite. Retrieved 2011-06-10. } It was Thomas Willis who in 1675 added &quot; mellitus &quot; to the word &quot; diabetes &quot; as a designation for the disease, when he noticed the urine of a diabetic had a sweet taste ( glycosuria ). This sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, and Persians. [ Society and culture ] The 1990 &quot; St. Vincent Declaration &quot; [ Theodore H.

Doing so is important not only in terms of quality of life and life expectancy, but also economically—expenses due to diabetes have been shown to be a major drain on health- and productivity-related resources for healthcare systems and governments. Several countries established more and less successful national diabetes programmes to improve treatment of the disease.

Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs are twice as likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are also more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature Poodles.

Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognised in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.
