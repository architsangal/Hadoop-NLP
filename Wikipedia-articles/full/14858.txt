They married in Hawaii in 1992. It was announced in early 2007 that, after 25 years together, they had separated.

He was a signatory to the Declaration of Calton Hill, which calls for Scottish independence. { The Scottish Socialist Party &quot; Rallying for a Republic &quot;, 9 October 2004 } In late 2004, Banks was a member of a group of British politicians and media figures who campaigned to have Prime Minister Tony Blair impeached following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In protest he cut up his passport and posted it to 10 Downing Street. In an interview in Socialist Review he claimed he did this after he &quot; abandoned the idea of crashing my Land Rover through the gates of Fife dockyard, after spotting the guys armed with machine guns. &quot; { Socialist Review &quot; Changing society, imagining the future &quot;, February 2008 } He relates his concerns about the invasion of Iraq in his book Raw Spirit, and the principal protagonist (Alban McGill) in the novel The Steep Approach to Garbadale confronts another character with arguments in a similar vein. Banks is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society (see Quotations) and a Distinguished Supporter of the Humanist Society of Scotland. He has spoken out in support of Scottish independence.

His parents wished to name him Iain Menzies Banks but his father made a mistake when registering the birth and he was officially registered as Iain Banks. Despite this he continued to use his middle name, and it may be considered official by adoption. It was as Iain M. Banks that he submitted The Wasp Factory for publication; his editor asked if he would mind dropping the &apos;M&apos; as it appeared &quot; too fussy &quot;. The editor also raised concerns about possible confusion with Rosie M. Banks, a minor romantic novelist in P.G. Wodehouse&apos;s Jeeves novels. Following his three mainstream novels, his publishers agreed to publish his first SF novel, Consider Phlebas. To distinguish between the mainstream and SF novels, Banks suggested the return of the &apos;M&apos;.

He chose firstly Shenandoah sung by Paul Robeson, which reminded him of time spent as a child living by the Rivers Forth and Clyde, a girl he loved from afar as a teenager, and his father&apos;s funeral the previous year.
