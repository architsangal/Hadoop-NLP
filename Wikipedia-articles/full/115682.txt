Washington Plaza in downtown Monroe [ History ] Monroe Convention Hall across from City Hall { Catholic Church in downtown Monroe } The settlement formerly known as Fort Miro adopted the name Monroe in honor of the steam powered paddle-wheeler James Monroe. The arrival of the ship had a profound effect on the settlers. It was the singular event that transformed the outpost into a town, in the minds of local residents. The ship is depicted in a mural at the main branch of the Monroe Library on North 18th Street. Therefore, credit is given to James Monroe of Virginia, the fifth President of the United States and, with Robert R. Livingston, one of the negotiators of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France, for whom the ship was named. During the American Civil War, Monroe and Opelousas, the seat of St. Landry Parish in south Louisiana, had Confederate training camps. They were established after the fall of New Orleans to the Union in 1862. Conscript s were soon sent to both camps. { John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, } { Baton Rouge : } { Louisiana State University Press, 1963, ISBN 0-8071-0834-0, p. 149 } In 1862, Monroe and Delhi in Richland Parish became overcrowded with unwelcome refugees from rural areas to the east. They had fled the forces of Union General U.S. Grant, who moved into northeastern Louisiana and spent the winter of 1862–1863 at Winter Quarters south of Newellton in Tensas Parish. He was preparing for the siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, not completed until July 4, 1863. Historian John D. Winters reported &quot; strong Union sympathy &quot; in both Delhi and Monroe. As the refugees moved further west toward Minden in Webster Parish, many of the existing inhabitants, themselves very poor, refused to sell them food or shelter and treated them with contempt. { Winters, pp. 307–308 } Union boats came up the Ouachita River to Monroe to trade coffee, liquor, dry goods, and money for cotton. &quot; Confederate officers were accused by a citizen of encouraging the trade and of fraternizing with the enemy, eating their oysters, and drinking their liquor. &quot; { Winters, p. 406 } As the war continued, deserters and stragglers about Monroe became &quot; so plentiful that the Union Army sent a special detachment &quot; from Alexandria to apprehend them. { Winters, p. 416 } In 1913, Joseph A. Biedenharn, the first bottler of Coca-Cola, moved to Monroe from Vicksburg, Mississippi. His home and gardens at 2006 Riverside Drive in Monroe now operates as a house museum. [ http://www.goby.com/biedenharn-museum-and-gardens--near--monroe-la/ex-104335 Biedenharn Museum and Gardens goby.com August 18, 2010 ] Until Biedenharn&apos;s breakthrough, Coca-Cola had been available only when individually mixed at the soda fountain. Biedenharn was also one of the founders of Delta Air Lines, originally Delta Air Service. Collett E. Woolman, the Ouachita Parish agent originally from Indiana, pioneered crop dusting to eradicate the boll weevil, which destroyed cotton in the Mississippi River delta country in the early 20th century. Woolman originated the first crop-dusting service in the world.
