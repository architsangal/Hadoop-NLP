They are common in freshwater, and also occur in marine and brackish habitats. Each cell is around 10-50 μm in size and flattened in shape, with an anterior groove or pocket. At the edge of the pocket there are typically two slightly unequal flagella. Some may exhibit mixotrophy.

Benjamin Cummings (Pearson), San Francisco, CA } If the cells are irritated either by mechanical, chemical or light stress, they discharge, propelling the cell in a zig-zag course away from the disturbance. Large ejectisomes, visible under the light microscope, are associated with the pocket; smaller ones occur underneath the periplast, the cryptophyte-specific cell surrounding. { Morrall S, Greenwood AD (1980) A comparison of the periodic sub-structures of the trichocysts of the Cryptophyceae and Prasinophyceae. BioSystems 12:71–83 } { Grim JN, Staehelin LA (1984) The ejectisomes of the flagellate Chilomonas paramecium - Visualization by freeze-fracture and isolation techniques. Journal of Protozoology 31: 259-267 } Cryptomonads have one or two chloroplasts, except for Chilomonas, which has leucoplast s and Goniomonas (formerly Cyathomonas) which lacks plastids entirely. These contain chlorophyll s a and c, together with phycobiliprotein s and other pigments, and vary in color (brown, red to blueish-green). Each is surrounded by four membranes, and there is a reduced cell nucleus called a nucleomorph between the middle two. This indicates that the plastid was derived from a eukaryotic symbiont, shown by genetic studies to have been a red alga. { Douglas S, Zauner S, Fraunholz M, Beaton M, Penny S, Deng LT, Wu XN, Reith M, Cavalier-Smith T, Maier UG (2002) The highly reduced genome of an enslaved algal nucleus. Nature 410: 1091-1096 } A few cryptomonads, such as Cryptomonas, can form palmelloid stages, but readily escape the surrounding mucus to become free-living flagellates again. Some Cryptomonas species may also form immotile resting stages with rigid cell walls ( cysts ) to survive unfavorable conditions. Cryptomonad flagella are inserted parallel to one another, and are covered by bipartite hairs called mastigonemes, formed within the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the cell surface. Small scales may also be present on the flagella and cell body. The mitochondria have flat crista e, and mitosis is open; sexual reproduction has also been reported. [ Classification ] Originally the cryptomonads were considered close relatives of the dinoflagellate s because of their (seemingly) similar pigmentation. Later botanists treated them as a separate division, Cryptophyta, while zoologists treated them as the flagellate order Cryptomonadida. There is considerable evidence that cryptomonad chloroplasts are closely related to those of the heterokont s and haptophyte s, and the three groups are sometimes united as the Chromista. However, the case that the organisms themselves are closely related is not very strong, and they may have acquired plastids independently. Currently they are discussed to be members of the kingdom Chromalveolata and to form together with the Haptophyta the group Hacrobia. One suggested grouping is as follows: (1) Cryptomonas, (2) Chroomonas / Komma and Hemiselmis, (3) Rhodomonas / Rhinomonas / Storeatula, (4) Guillardia / Hanusia, (5) Geminigera / Plagioselmis / Teleaulax, (6) Proteomonas sulcata, (7) Falcomonas daucoides.
