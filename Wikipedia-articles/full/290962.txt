January 27, 2010 } [ History ] Keynote began as a software program for Apple CEO Steve Jobs to use in creating the presentations for Macworld Conference and Expo and other Apple keynote events. { O&apos;Reilly&apos;s MacDevCentre Article by Daniel H. Steinberg; Jan 10, 2003 } Prior to using Keynote, Jobs had used Concurrence, from Lighthouse Design, a similar product which ran on the NeXTSTEP and OpenStep platforms. The program was first sold publicly as Keynote 1.0 in 2003, competing against existing presentation software, most notably Microsoft PowerPoint. In 2005 Apple began selling Keynote 2.0 in conjunction with Pages, a new word processing and page layout application, in a software package called iWork. At the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo 2006, Apple released iWork &apos;06 with updated versions of Keynote 3.0 and Pages 2.0. In addition to official HD compatibility, Keynote 3 added new features, including group scaling, 3D charts, multi-column text boxes, auto bullets in any text field, image adjustments, and free form masking tools. In addition, Keynote features three-dimensional transitions, such as a rotating cube or a simple flip of the slide. In the fall of 2007, Apple released Keynote 4.0 in iWork &apos;08, along with Pages 3.0 and the new Numbers spreadsheet application. [ Features ] Themes that allow the user to keep consistency in colors and fonts throughout the presentation, including charts, graphs and tables. OpenGL -powered 3D slide transitions and builds that resemble rolling cubes or flipping pages, or dissolving transitions that fade one slide into the next. Dual monitor support: the presenter can show the presentation on a screen and still see the desktop or notes from his or her laptop or presenter screen. Exports to PDF, QuickTime, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, HTML (with JPEG images) and PowerPoint. Keynote also uses.key (presentation files) and.kth (theme files) bundles based on XML. http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/iWork2-0_XML/Chapter01/chapter_1_section_1.html Supports all QuickTime video formats (including MPEG-2 and DV ) in slideshows. Version 3 brings export to iDVD with clickability. Compatibility with Apple Remote and the Keynote remote application for iPhone and iPod touch.
