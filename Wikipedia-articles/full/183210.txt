The focus is on evacuation, rather than long-term survival, distinguishing the bug-out bag from a survival kit, a boating or aviation emergency kit, or a fixed-site disaster supplies kit. The kits are also popular in the survivalism subculture. { Rawles, James Wesley, Rawles on Retreats and Relocation, The Clearwater Press, Kooskia, ID, 2007, p. 5 } The term &quot; bug-out bag &quot; is related to, and possibly derived from, the &quot; bail-out bag &quot; emergency kit many military aviators carry. The concept passed into wide usage among other military and law enforcement personnel, though the &quot; bail-out bag &quot; is as likely to include emergency gear for going into an emergency situation as for escaping an emergency.

The recommendation that a bug-out bag should contain enough supplies for seventy-two hours arises from advice from organizations responsible for disaster relief and management that it may take them up to seventy two hours to reach people affected by a disaster and offer help. The bag&apos;s contents may vary according to the region of the user, where as someone evacuating from the path of a hurricane may have different supplies than someone one that lives in an area prone to tornadoes or wildfires. In addition to allowing one to survive a disaster evacuation, a bug-out bag may also be utilized when sheltering in place as a response to emergencies such as house fires, blackout s, tornadoes, and other severe natural disasters.
