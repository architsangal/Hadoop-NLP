[ Noam Chomsky&apos;s 2006 book Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy ] [[File:Failed-states-index-loop-2010.gif|right|thumb|Failed States according to the &quot; Failed States Index &quot; of Foreign Policy [ #860101 Alert ] [ #fe8200 Warning ] [ #b9b9b9 No Information / Dependent Territory ] [ #fefe84 Moderate ] [ #428284 Sustainable ] ]] A failed state is a state perceived as having failed at some of the basic conditions and responsibilities of a sovereign government. In order to make this definition more precise, the following attributes, proposed by the Fund for Peace, are often used to characterize a failed state: loss of control of its territory, or of the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force therein, erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions, an inability to provide public services, and an inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community. Often a failed state is characterized by social, political, and/or economic failure. Common characteristics of a failing state include a central government so weak or ineffective that it has little practical control over much of its territory; non-provision of public services; widespread corruption and criminality; refugees and involuntary movement of populations; and sharp economic decline. [ http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Btask%3Dview%26amp%3Bid%3D102%26amp%3BItemid%3D327#3 Failed States FAQ Number 6 the Fund for Peace 2007-10-22 ] The level of government control required to avoid being considered a failed state varies considerably amongst authorities. [ 1079-1760 ] { 2007 } { 9 } { 644–662 } { 4 } Furthermore, the declaration that a state has &quot; failed &quot; is generally controversial and, when made authoritatively, may carry significant geopolitical consequences. [ Definition ] There is no clear universal definition of a &quot; failed state &quot;. A state could be said to &quot; succeed &quot; if it maintains, in the words of Max Weber, a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within its borders. When this is broken (e.g., through the dominant presence of warlord s, paramilitary groups, or terrorism ), the very existence of the state becomes dubious, and the state becomes a failed state. The difficulty of determining whether a government maintains &quot; a monopoly on the legitimate use of force &quot;, which includes the problems of the definition of &quot; legitimate &quot;, means it is not clear precisely when a state can be said to have &quot; failed. &quot; The problem of legitimacy can be solved by understanding what Weber intended by it. Weber clearly explains that only the state has the means of production necessary for physical violence (politics as vocation). This means that the state does not require legitimacy for achieving monopoly on having the means of violence ( de facto ), but will need one if it needs to use it ( de jure ). Typically, the term means that the state has been rendered ineffective and is not able to enforce its laws uniformly because of (variously) high crime rates, extreme political corruption, an impenetrable and ineffective bureaucracy, judicial ineffectiveness, military interference in politics, and cultural situations in which traditional leaders wield more power than the state over a certain area. Other factors of perception may be involved. A derived concept of &quot; failed cities &quot; has also been launched, based on the notion that while a state may function in general, polities at the substate level may collapse in terms of infrastructure, economy and social policy. Certain areas or cities may even fall outside state control, becoming a de facto ungoverned part of the state. { Braathen, Einar: Brazil: Successful country, failed cities? ( NIBR International Blog 24.01.2011 ). } The spread of the term &quot; failed state &quot; has been criticized by policy researchers for being arbitrary and sensationalist. William Easterly and Laura Freschi have argued that the concept of state failure &quot; has no coherent definition &quot;, and only serves the policy goals of Western states to militarily intervene in other states.

Although he concedes that Pakistan might be considered &quot; failed &quot; when compared to the industrialized states of Western Europe, he criticizes how commentators use the War in North-West Pakistan to brand Pakistan as &quot; failed &quot;, while not doing the same for the proportionally more serious Naxalite insurgency in India or the Sri Lankan Civil War. [ Pakistan: A Hard Country Anatol Lieven PublicAffairs 2011 19-21 ] [ Crisis States Research Centre ] The Crisis States Research Centre defines a &quot; failed state &quot; as a condition of &quot; state collapse &quot; – i.e., a state that can no longer perform its basic security and development functions and that has no effective control over its territory and borders. A failed state is one that can no longer reproduce the conditions for its own existence. This term is used in very contradictory ways in the policy community (for instance, there is a tendency to label a &quot; poorly performing &quot; state as &quot; failed &quot; – a tendency the Crisis States Research Centre rejects). The opposite of a &quot; failed state &quot; is an &quot; enduring state &quot; and the absolute dividing line between these two conditions is difficult to ascertain at the margins. Even in a failed state, some elements of the state, such as local state organisations, might continue to exist. [ Failed States Index ] [ List of countries by Failed States Index ] Since 2005 the United States think-tank Fund for Peace and the magazine Foreign Policy, publishes an annual index called the Failed States Index. The list only assesses sovereign states (determined by membership in the United Nations.) [ http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Btask%3Dview%26amp%3Bid%3D102%26amp%3BItemid%3D327 Failed States FAQ the Fund for Peace 2007-08-25 ] Several territories are excluded until their political status and UN membership is ratified in international law. For example, Taiwan, the Palestinian Territories, Northern Cyprus, Kosovo, and Western Sahara are not included in the list, even though some are recognized as sovereign states by some nations. Ranking is based on the total scores of the 12 indicators (see below.) For each indicator, the ratings are placed on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the lowest intensity (most stable) and 10 being the highest intensity (least stable). The total score is the sum of the 12 indicators and is on a scale of 0-120. [ Indicators of state vulnerability ] The index&apos;s ranks are based on twelve indicators of state vulnerability - four social, two economic and six political. [ http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id%3D3865 Failed States list 2007 Foreign Policy magazine 2007-06-19 ] The indicators are not designed to forecast when states may experience violence or collapse. Instead, they are meant to measure a state&apos;s vulnerability to collapse or conflict. All countries in the red (Alert, FSI of 90 or more), orange (Warning, FSI of 60 or more), or yellow (Moderate, FSI of 30 or more) categories display some features that make parts of their societies and institutions vulnerable to failure. Some in the yellow zone may be failing at a faster rate than those in the more dangerous orange or red zones, and therefore could experience violence sooner. Conversely, some in the red zone, though critical, may exhibit some positive signs of recovery or be deteriorating slowly, giving them time to adopt mitigating strategies. [ Social indicators ] Demographic pressures: including the pressures deriving from high population density relative to food supply and other life-sustaining resources. The pressure from a population&apos;s settlement patterns and physical settings, including border disputes, ownership or occupancy of land, access to transportation outlets, control of religious or historical sites, and proximity to environmental hazards.

[ http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/content/fsi/fsi_2.htm Massive movement of refugees and internally displaced peoples the Fund for Peace 2007-08-25 ] Legacy of vengeance-seeking group grievance: based on recent or past injustices, which could date back centuries. Including atrocities committed with impunity against communal groups and/or specific groups singled out by state authorities, or by dominant groups, for persecution or repression. Institutionalized political exclusion. Public scapegoat ing of groups believed to have acquired wealth, status or power as evidenced in the emergence of &quot; hate &quot; radio, pamphleteering and stereotypical or nationalistic political rhetoric.

Also measured by group-based poverty levels, infant mortality rates, education levels. [ http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/content/fsi/fsi_5.htm Uneven economic development along group lines the Fund for Peace 2007-08-25 ] Sharp and/or severe economic decline: measured by a progressive economic decline of the society as a whole (using: per capita income, GNP, debt, child mortality rates, poverty levels, business failures.) A sudden drop in commodity prices, trade revenue, foreign investment or debt payments. Collapse or devaluation of the national currency and a growth of hidden economies, including the drug trade, smuggling, and capital flight. Failure of the state to pay salaries of government employees and armed forces or to meet other financial obligations to its citizens, such as pension payments. [ http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/content/fsi/fsi_6.htm Sharp and/or severe economic decline the Fund for Peace 2007-08-25 ] [ Political indicators ] Criminalization and/or delegitimisation of the state: endemic corruption or profiteering by ruling elites and resistance to transparency, accountability and political representation. Includes any widespread loss of popular confidence in state institutions and processes.

Also using the state apparatus for agencies that serve the ruling elites, such as the security forces, presidential staff, central bank, diplomatic service, customs and collection agencies. [ http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/content/fsi/fsi_8.htm Progressive deterioration of public services the Fund for Peace 2007-08-25 ] Widespread violation of human rights: an emergence of authoritarian, dictatorial or military rule in which constitutional and democratic institutions and processes are suspended or manipulated. Outbreaks of politically inspired (as opposed to criminal) violence against innocent civilians. A rising number of political prisoners or dissidents who are denied due process consistent with international norms and practices. Any widespread abuse of legal, political and social rights, including those of individuals, groups or cultural institutions (e.g., harassment of the press, politicization of the judiciary, internal use of military for political ends, public repression of political opponents, religious or cultural persecution.)

Emergence of rival militias, guerilla forces or private armies in an armed struggle or protracted violent campaigns against state security forces. [ http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/content/fsi/fsi_10.htm Security apparatus the Fund for Peace 2007-08-25 ] Rise of factionalised elites: a fragmentation of ruling elites and state institutions along group lines. Use of aggressive nationalistic rhetoric by ruling elites, especially destructive forms of communal irredentism or communal solidarity (e.g., &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot;, &quot; defending the faith &quot; ). [ http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/content/fsi/fsi_11.htm Rise of factionalised elites: the Fund for Peace 2007-08-25 ] Intervention of other states or external factors: military or Paramilitary engagement in the internal affairs of the state at risk by outside armies, states, identity groups or entities that affect the internal balance of power or resolution of the conflict.
