A diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum, showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengths The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. [ http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/dict_ei.html#em_spectrum Imagine the Universe! Dictionary ] The &quot; electromagnetic spectrum &quot; of an object is the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object. The electromagnetic spectrum extends from low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short- wavelength (high-frequency) end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometer s down to a fraction of the size of an atom. It is for this reason that the electromagnetic spectrum is highly studied for spectroscopic purposes to characterize matter.

Freq= Frequency ]] [ History ] For most of history, light was the only known part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The ancient Greeks recognized that light traveled in straight lines and studied some of the properties of it, including reflection and refraction. Over the years the study of light continued and during the 16th and 17th centuries there were conflicting theories which regarded light as either a wave or a particle. It was first linked to electromagnetism in 1845 when Michael Faraday noticed that light responded to a magnetic field. The first discovery of electromagnetic waves other than light came in 1800, when William Herschel discovered infrared light. He was studying the temperature of different colors by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism. He noticed that the hottest temperature was beyond red. He theorized that there was &apos;light&apos; that you could not see. The next year, Johann Ritter worked at the other end of the spectrum and noticed that there were &apos;chemical rays&apos; that behaved similar to, but were beyond, visible violet light rays. They were later renamed ultraviolet radiation. During the 1860s James Maxwell was studying electromagnetic field and realized that they traveled at around the speed of light. He developed four partial differential equations to explain this correlation. These equations predicted many frequencies of electromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light. Attempting to prove Maxwell&apos;s equations, in 1886 Heinrich Hertz built an apparatus to generate and detect radio waves. He was able to observe that they traveled at the speed of light and could be both reflected and refracted. In a later experiment he similarly produced and measured microwaves. These new waves paved the way for inventions such as the wireless telegraph and the radio. In 1895 Wilhelm Röntgen noticed a new type of radiation emitted during an experiment. He called these x-rays and found they were able to travel through parts of the human body but were reflected by denser matter such as bones. Before long many uses were found for them in the field of medicine. The last portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was filled in with the discovery of gamma ray s. In 1900 Paul Villard was studying radioactivity. He first thought they were particles similar to alpha and beta particles. However, in 1910 Ernest Rutherford measured their wavelengths and found that they were electromagnetic waves. [ Range of the spectrum ] Electromagnetic waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties: the frequency f, wavelength λ, or photon energy E. Frequencies range from [ 2.4 23 Hz ] (1 GeV gamma rays) down to the local plasma frequency of the ionized interstellar medium (~1  kHz). Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of atom s, whereas wavelengths can be as long as the universe. Photon energy is directly proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma rays have the highest energy (around a billion electron volt s ) and radio waves have very low energy (around a femto electronvolt ). These relations are illustrated by the following equations: f = \frac{c}{\lambda}, \quad\text{or}\quad f = \frac{E}{h}, \quad\text{or}\quad E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}, where: [ 299792458 m/s ] [ 6.62606896 (33) -34 J s ] [ 4.13566733 (10) -15 eV s ] [ http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?h ] c = is the speed of light in vacuum and h = = is Planck&apos;s constant. Whenever electromagnetic waves exist in a medium with matter, their wavelength is decreased. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, no matter what medium they are traveling through, are usually quoted in terms of the vacuum wavelength, although this is not always explicitly stated. Generally, electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength into radio wave, microwave, terahertz (or sub-millimeter) radiation, infrared, the visible region we perceive as light, ultraviolet, X-ray s and gamma rays. The behavior of EM radiation depends on its wavelength. When EM radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior also depends on the amount of energy per quantum (photon) it carries. Spectroscopy can detect a much wider region of the EM spectrum than the visible range of 400  nm to 700  nm. A common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2  nm to 2500  nm. Detailed information about the physical properties of objects, gases, or even stars can be obtained from this type of device. Spectroscopes are widely used in astrophysics. For example, many hydrogen atom s emit a radio wave photon that has a wavelength of 21.12  cm. Also, frequencies of 30 Hz and below can be produced by and are important in the study of certain stellar nebulae [ http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/Pulsars.html Essential Radio Astronomy: Pulsar Properties J. J. Condon and S. M. Ransom National Radio Astronomy Observatory 2008-01-05 ] and frequencies as high as [ 2.9 27 Hz ] have been detected from astrophysical sources. [ 10.1086/513696 Discovery of TeV Gamma-Ray Emission from the Cygnus Region of the Galaxy The Astrophysical Journal Letters 2007 A. A. Abdo 658 L33 2007ApJ...658L..33A astro-ph/0611691, 1 Allen B. Berley D. Blaufuss E. Casanova S. Chen C. Coyne D. G. Delay R. S. Dingus B. L. ] [ Rationale ] Electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter in different ways in different parts of the spectrum. The types of interaction can be so different that it seems to be justified to refer to different types of radiation. At the same time, there is a continuum containing all these &quot; different kinds &quot; of electromagnetic radiation. Thus we refer to a spectrum, but divide it up based on the different interactions with matter. Region of the spectrum Main interactions with matter Radio Collective oscillation of charge carriers in bulk material ( plasma oscillation ). An example would be the oscillation of the electrons in an antenna. Microwave through far infrared Plasma oscillation, molecular rotation Near infrared Molecular vibration, plasma oscillation (in metals only) Visible Molecular electron excitation (including pigment molecules found in the human retina), plasma oscillations (in metals only) Ultraviolet Excitation of molecular and atomic valence electrons, including ejection of the electrons ( photoelectric effect ) X-rays Excitation and ejection of core atomic electrons, Compton scattering (for low atomic numbers) Gamma ray s Energetic ejection of core electrons in heavy elements, Compton scattering (for all atomic numbers), excitation of atomic nuclei, including dissociation of nuclei High-energy gamma ray s Creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. At very high energies a single photon can create a shower of high-energy particles and antiparticles upon interaction with matter. [ Types of radiation ] The &apos;&apos;&apos;electromagnetic spectrum&apos;&apos;&apos; The types of electromagnetic radiation are broadly classified into the following classes: Gamma radiation X-ray radiation Ultraviolet radiation Visible radiation Infrared radiation Microwave radiation Radio waves This classification goes in the increasing order of wavelength, which is characteristic of the type of radiation. While, in general, the classification scheme is accurate, in reality there is often some overlap between neighboring types of electromagnetic energy. For example, SLF radio waves at 60  Hz may be received and studied by astronomers, or may be ducted along wires as electric power, although the latter is, in the strict sense, not electromagnetic radiation at all (see near and far field )The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays is based on sources: gamma rays are the photons generated from nuclear decay or other nuclear and subnuclear/particle process, whereas X-rays are generated by electron ic transitions involving highly energetic inner atomic electrons. [ Feynman Richard Robert Leighton, Matthew Sands The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol.1 Addison-Wesley 1963 USA 2–5 0-201-02116-1 ] [ L&apos;Annunziata Michael Mohammad Baradei Handbook of Radioactivity Analysis Academic Press 2003 58 http://books.google.com/?id%3Db519e10OPT0C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA58%26amp%3Bdq%3Dgamma%2Bx-ray 0-12-436603-1 ] [ Grupen Claus G. Cowan, S. D. Eidelman, T. Stroh Astroparticle Physics Springer 2005 109 3-540-25312-2 ] In general, nuclear transitions are much more energetic than electronic transitions, so gamma-rays are more energetic than X-rays, but exceptions exist. By analogy to electronic transitions, muonic atom transitions are also said to produce X-rays, even though their energy may exceed [ 6 MeV ], { Corrections to muonic X-rays and a possible proton halo slac-pub-0335 (1967) } whereas there are many (77 known to be less than [ 10 keV on ] ) low-energy nuclear transitions (e.g., the [ 7.6 eV on ] nuclear transition of thorium -229), and, despite being one million-fold less energetic than some muonic X-rays, the emitted photons are still called gamma rays due to their nuclear origin. [ http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ems3.html#c5 Hyperphysics (see Gamma-Rays Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu 2010-10-16 ] Also, the region of the spectrum of the particular electromagnetic radiation is reference frame -dependent (on account of the Doppler shift for light), so EM radiation that one observer would say is in one region of the spectrum could appear to an observer moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light with respect to the first to be in another part of the spectrum. For example, consider the cosmic microwave background. It was produced, when matter and radiation decoupled, by the de-excitation of hydrogen atoms to the ground state. These photons were from Lyman series transitions, putting them in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Now this radiation has undergone enough cosmological red shift to put it into the microwave region of the spectrum for observers moving slowly (compared to the speed of light) with respect to the cosmos. However, for particles moving near the speed of light, this radiation will be blue-shift ed in their rest frame. The highest-energy cosmic ray protons are moving such that, in their rest frame, this radiation is blueshifted to high-energy gamma rays, which interact with the proton to produce bound quark-antiquark pairs ( pions ). This is the source of the GZK limit. [ Radio frequency ] [ Radio frequency Radio spectrum Radio waves ] Radio waves generally are utilized by antennas of appropriate size (according to the principle of resonance ), with wavelengths ranging from hundreds of meters to about one millimeter. They are used for transmission of data, via modulation. Television, mobile phone s, wireless networking, and amateur radio all use radio waves. The use of the radio spectrum is regulated by many governments through frequency allocation. Radio waves can be made to carry information by varying a combination of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the wave within a frequency band. When EM radiation impinges upon a conductor, it couples to the conductor, travels along it, and induces an electric current on the surface of that conductor by exciting the electrons of the conducting material. This effect (the skin effect ) is used in antennas. [ Microwaves ] [ Microwaves ] Plot of Earth&apos;s atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. The super-high frequency ( SHF ) and extremely high frequency ( EHF ) of microwave s come after radio waves. Microwaves are waves that are typically short enough to employ tubular metal waveguide s of reasonable diameter. Microwave energy is produced with klystron and magnetron tubes, and with solid state diode s such as Gunn and IMPATT devices. Microwaves are absorbed by molecules that have a dipole moment in liquids. In a microwave oven, this effect is used to heat food. Low-intensity microwave radiation is used in Wi-Fi, although this is at intensity levels unable to cause thermal heating. Volumetric heating, as used by microwave oven s, transfers energy through the material electromagnetically, not as a thermal heat flux. The benefit of this is a more uniform heating and reduced heating time; microwaves can heat material in less than 1% of the time of conventional heating methods. When active, the average microwave oven is powerful enough to cause interference at close range with poorly shielded electromagnetic fields such as those found in mobile medical devices and cheap consumer electronics. [ Terahertz radiation ] [ Terahertz radiation ] Terahertz radiation is a region of the spectrum between far infrared and microwaves. Until recently, the range was rarely studied and few sources existed for microwave energy at the high end of the band (sub-millimeter waves or so-called terahertz waves ), but applications such as imaging and communications are now appearing. Scientists are also looking to apply terahertz technology in the armed forces, where high-frequency waves might be directed at enemy troops to incapacitate their electronic equipment. [ Advanced weapon systems using lethal Short-pulse terahertz radiation from high-intensity-laser-produced plasmas March 6, 2005 http://www.indiadaily.com/editorial/1803.asp India Daily 2010-09-27 ] [ Infrared radiation ] [ Infrared radiation ] The infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from roughly 300  GHz (1  mm) to 400 THz (750  nm). It can be divided into three parts: Far-infrared, from 300  GHz (1  mm) to 30 THz (10 μm). The lower part of this range may also be called microwaves. This radiation is typically absorbed by so-called rotational modes in gas-phase molecules, by molecular motions in liquids, and by phonons in solids. The water in Earth&apos;s atmosphere absorbs so strongly in this range that it renders the atmosphere in effect opaque. However, there are certain wavelength ranges ( &quot; windows &quot; ) within the opaque range that allow partial transmission, and can be used for astronomy. The wavelength range from approximately 200 μm up to a few mm is often referred to as &quot; sub-millimeter &quot; in astronomy, reserving far infrared for wavelengths below 200 μm. Mid-infrared, from 30 to 120 THz (10 to 2.5 μm). Hot objects ( black-body radiators) can radiate strongly in this range. It is absorbed by molecular vibrations, where the different atoms in a molecule vibrate around their equilibrium positions. This range is sometimes called the fingerprint region, since the mid-infrared absorption spectrum of a compound is very specific for that compound. Near-infrared, from 120 to 400 THz (2,500 to 750  nm). Physical processes that are relevant for this range are similar to those for visible light. [ Visible radiation (light) ] [ Visible spectrum ] Above infrared in frequency comes visible light. This is the range in which the sun and other star s emit most of their radiation [ August 2011 ] and the spectrum that the human eye is the most sensitive to. Visible light (and near-infrared light) is typically absorbed and emitted by electrons in molecules and atoms that move from one energy level to another. The light we see with our eyes is really a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. A rainbow shows the optical (visible) part of the electromagnetic spectrum; infrared (if you could see it) would be located just beyond the red side of the rainbow with ultraviolet appearing just beyond the violet end. Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 nm and 760  nm (790–400 terahertz) is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially near infrared (longer than 760  nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 380  nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when the visibility to humans is not relevant. White light is a combination of lights of different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Passing white light through a prism splits it up in to the several colors of light observed in the visible spectrum between 400  nm and 780  nm. If radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off an object, say, a bowl of fruit, and then strikes our eyes, this results in our visual perception of the scene. Our brain&apos;s visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues, and through this insufficiently-understood psychophysical phenomenon, most people perceive a bowl of fruit. At most wavelengths, however, the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses. Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum, and our technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths. Optical fiber transmits light that, although not necessarily in the visible part of the spectrum, can carry information. The modulation is similar to that used with radio waves. [ Ultraviolet light ] [ Ultraviolet ] { ozone } Next in frequency comes ultraviolet (UV). The wavelength of UV rays is shorter than the violet end of the visible spectrum but longer than the X-ray. UV in the very shortest range (next to X-rays) is capable even of ionizing atoms (see photoelectric effect ), greatly changing their physical behavior. At the middle range of UV, UV rays cannot ionize but can break chemical bonds, making molecules to be unusually reactive. Sunburn, for example, is caused by the disruptive effects of middle range UV radiation on skin cells, which is the main cause of skin cancer. UV rays in the middle range can irreparably damage the complex DNA molecules in the cells producing thymine dimers making it a very potent mutagen. The sun emits a large amount of UV radiation, which could potentially turn Earth&apos;s land surface into a barren desert (although ocean water would provide some protection for life there). However, most of the Sun&apos;s most-damaging UV wavelengths are absorbed by the atmosphere&apos;s nitrogen, oxygen, and ozone layer before they reach the surface. The higher ranges of UV (vacuum UV) are absorbed by nitrogen and, at longer wavelengths, by simple diatomic oxygen in the air. Most of the UV in this mid-range is blocked by the ozone layer, which absorbs strongly in the important 200–315  nm range, the lower part of which is too long to be absorbed by ordinary oxygen in air. The range between 315  nm and visible light (called UV-A) is not blocked well by the atmosphere, but does not cause sunburn and does less biological damage. However, it is not harmless and does cause oxygen radicals, mutation and skin damage. See ultraviolet for more information. [ X-rays ] [ X-rays ] After UV come X-ray s, which, like the upper ranges of UV are also ionizing. However, due to their higher energies, X-rays can also interact with matter by means of the Compton effect. Hard X-rays have shorter wavelengths than soft X-rays. As they can pass through most substances, X-rays can be used to &apos;see through&apos; objects, the most notable use being diagnostic X-ray images in medicine (a process known as radiography ), as well as for high-energy physics and astronomy. Neutron star s and accretion disks around black hole s emit X-rays, which enable us to study them. X-rays are given off by stars and are strongly emitted by some types of nebulae. [ Gamma rays ] [ Gamma rays ] After hard X-rays come gamma rays, which were discovered by Paul Villard in 1900. These are the most energetic photons, having no defined lower limit to their wavelength. They are useful to astronomers in the study of high-energy objects or regions, and find a use with physicists thanks to their penetrative ability and their production from radioisotopes. Gamma rays are also used for the irradiation of food and seed for sterilization, and in medicine they are used in radiation cancer therapy and some kinds of diagnostic imaging such as PET scans. The wavelength of gamma rays can be measured with high accuracy by means of Compton scattering. Note that there are no precisely defined boundaries between the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radiation of some types have a mixture of the properties of those in two regions of the spectrum. For example, red light resembles infrared radiation in that it can resonate some chemical bonds.
