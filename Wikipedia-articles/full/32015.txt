The University of Arizona was the first university in the state of Arizona, founded in 1885 (twenty-seven years before the Arizona Territory achieved statehood). The university includes the University of Arizona College of Medicine which is one of three medical schools and the only MD granting medical school in Arizona. As of Fall 2010, total enrollment was 39,086 students. The University of Arizona is governed by the Arizona Board of Regents. The mission of the University of Arizona is, &quot; To discover, educate, serve, and inspire. &quot; [ About the UA University of Arizona University of Arizona May 5, 2008 http://www.arizona.edu/home/aboutua.php ] Arizona is one of the elected members of the Association of American Universities (an organization of North America&apos;s premier research institutions) and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group. [ History ] Old Main, the oldest building on the University of Arizona campus The University of Arizona was approved by the Arizona Territory&apos;s &quot; Thieving Thirteenth &quot; Legislature in 1885. The city of Tucson had hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory&apos;s mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory&apos;s only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but at the time it was created as Arizona&apos;s normal school, and not a university). Tucson &apos;s contingent of legislators was delayed in reaching Prescott due to flooding on the Salt River and by the time they arrived back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had already been made. Tucson was largely disappointed at receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize. With no parties willing to step forth and provide land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate the land necessary to build the school. Classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, the first building constructed on campus, and still in use to this day. [ The Old Main Arizona Board of Regents 2005 UA History March 29, 2006 http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php http://web.archive.org/web/20060211105338/http%3A//www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php February 11, 2006 ] Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the University maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation. University of Arizona Mall Wildcat Family Statue A downturn in Arizona&apos;s economy in the 2000s (decade) led to less money being allocated by the state legislature to Arizona&apos;s universities. Academic programs were hard-hit, and the university was forced to consider extensive changes, beginning in 2001. As a result, a reorganization known as Focused Excellence aimed to focus the mission of the university on research, graduate training, and more selective undergraduate education, in part, by eliminating and merging less popular and low-revenue academic departments. The closure of some programs, notably the innovative Arizona International College and the School of Planning, provoked widespread protest. However, efforts to improve academic performance and to encourage new research areas were not enough to prevent a number of key departures from the faculty in the early 2000s (decade), and budgets remain restricted. Focused Excellence was quietly wound up in 2006 and its website removed, but President Robert Shelton&apos;s December 2006 message to the University suggested further retrenchment is essential in the light of funding cuts. [ Academics ] The University of Arizona offers 334 fields of study leading to bachelor&apos;s, master&apos;s, doctoral, and professional degrees. Academic departments and programs are organized into colleges and schools. The university maintains a current list of colleges and schools at http://www.arizona.edu/index/colleges.php.

[ Honors College ] The University of Arizona Honors College provides a program for over 3,000 students that creates a smaller community feel, like that of a liberal arts college, within a large, research institution. It started in 1962 with an acceptance of seventy-five students and has since grown to 3,316 in the academic year 2010–2011. The main offices for the University of Arizona Honors College are located near Park Ave. and 2nd Street, near the Harvill Lecture Hall building. These offices are known as the Slonaker House. The University of Arizona Honors College is in affiliation with the University of Arizona and is headed by Dean Dr. Patricia MacCorquodale and Associate Dean Dr. Laura Berry. Under the Dean and Vice Dean are the offices of the Academic Advising Coordinator, Director of Nationally Competitive Scholarships, Director of Recruitment and Outreach, Director of Development, Program Coordinator for Career and Development and Community Engagement, Honors Professors, and Honors advisors. The University of Arizona Honors College has a strong first-year program for its students that includes common reading materials and Colloquium/Paladin classes everyone must take as a freshman. The overall requirements for the program entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses specifically designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an honors course through the use of an honors contract. Certain restrictions apply. In addition, they must collaborate with a faculty member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona. The University of Arizona Honors College provides two on-campus dorms for their students, Yuma Hall and Árbol de la Vida. Yuma houses 184 men and women and is located near the Slonaker House on East North Campus Drive by the Maricopa Residence Hall. Árbol de la Vida houses 719 men and women and is situated on the edge of campus on 6th street and Tyndall Avenue near the Park Student Union and the dorm, Arizona Sonora. The two halls offer different community feels for their students. Yuma presents a close-knit, small community while Árbol de la Vida provides a larger community of honors students with a newer, more modern living experience. Yuma was renovated and turned into an honors dorm in 1988, whereas Árbol de la Vida first opened to students in the Fall of 2011. There are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities. However, there is also a fee for participating in honors and an additional honors thesis is required of its students before graduation. [ Research ] Arizona is classified as a Carnegie Foundation &quot; RU/VH: Research Universities (very high research activity) &quot; university (formerly &quot; Research 1 &quot; university).

The Main Library, opened in 1976, serves as the library system&apos;s reference, periodical, and administrative center; most of the main collections and special collections are housed here as well. The Main Library is located on the southeast quadrant of campus near McKale Center and Arizona Stadium. In 2002, a $20 million, [ 100000 sqft m2 -4 on ] addition, the Integrated Learning Center (ILC), was completed; it is a home base for first-year students (especially those undecided on a major) which features classrooms, auditoriums, a courtyard with an alcove for vending machines, and a greatly expanded computer lab (the Information Commons) with several dozen Gateway and Apple Macintosh G5 workstations (these computers are available for use by the general public (with some restrictions) as well as by UA students, faculty and staff). Much of the ILC was constructed underground, underneath the east end of the Mall; the ILC connects to the basement floor of the Main Library through the Information Commons. As part of the project, additional new office space for the Library was constructed on the existing fifth floor. The Science and Engineering Library is in a nearby building from the 1960s that houses volumes and periodicals from those fields. The Music Building (on the northwest quadrant of campus where many of the fine arts disciplines are clustered) houses the Fine Arts Library, including reference collections for architecture, music (including sheet music, recordings and listening stations), and photography. There is a small library at the Center for Creative Photography, also in the fine arts complex, devoted to the art and science of photography. The Law Library is in the law building (James E. Rogers College of Law), located at the intersection of Speedway Boulevard and Mountain Avenue. The Arizona Health Sciences Library, built in 1996, is located on the Health Sciences Center on the north end of campus and in Phoenix on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus. The library serves the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health, the University of Arizona Health Network, and is a resource for health professionals and citizens across the state.

It is the largest such collection that is &quot; open shelf &quot;. [ Campus ] Student Union, Old Main, and Forbes building The main campus sits on [ 380 acre km2 1 ] in central Tucson, about one mile (1.6  km) northeast of downtown. There are 179 buildings on the main campus. Many of the early buildings, including the Arizona State Museum buildings (one of them the 1927 main library) and Centennial Hall, were designed by Roy Place, a prominent Tucson architect. It was Place&apos;s use of red brick that set the tone for the red brick facades that are a basic and ubiquitous part of nearly all UA buildings, even those built in recent decades. Indeed, almost every UA building has red brick as a major component of the design, or at the very least, a stylistic accent to harmonize it with the other buildings on campus. { &quot; The Big Build-Up &quot;, Margaret Regan, &apos;&apos;Tucson Weekly&apos;&apos;, October 12, 2000 } { &quot; UA buildings ditch red brick to symbolize, inspire, teach &quot;, Tom Beal, &apos;&apos;Arizona Daily Star&apos;&apos;, April 29, 2007 } The campus is roughly divided into quadrants. The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus&apos; eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below). The science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library. Speedway Boulevard, one of Tucson&apos;s primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The University has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street. Park Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as Wendy&apos;s, McDonald&apos;s and Pei Wei. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university&apos;s early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story Marriott hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996. The oldest campus buildings are located west of Old Main. Most of the buildings east of Old Main date from the 1940s to the 1980s, with a few recent buildings constructed in the years since 1990. [ The Student Union Memorial Center ] Student Union Memorial Center The Student Union Memorial Center, located on the north side of the Mall east of Old Main, was completely reconstructed between 2000 and 2003, replacing a [ 270000 sqft m2 -3 on ] structure originally opened in 1951 (with additions in the 1960s). The new $60 million student union has [ 405000 sqft m2 -2 ] of space on four levels, including 14 restaurants (including a food court with such national chains as Burger King, Panda Express, Papa John&apos;s Pizza and Chick-fil-A), a new two-level bookstore (that includes a counter for Clinique merchandise as well as an office supplies section sponsored by Staples with many of the same Staples-branded items found in their regular stores), 23 meeting rooms, eight lounge areas (including one dedicated to the USS &apos;&apos;Arizona&apos;&apos; ), a computer lab, a U.S. Post Office, a Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt, and a copy center named Fast Copy. The building was designed to mirror the USS Arizona. A variety of sculptures pepper the premises, decorating the air with the chimes of dog tags or the colors of refracted light in honor of those who have served. A bell housed on the USS Arizona, one of the two bells rescued from the ship after the attack on Pearl Harbor, has a permanent home in the clock tower of the Student Union Memorial Center on campus. The bell first arrived on campus in July 1946. The bell is rung seven times on the third Wednesday of every month at 12:07  pm – symbolic of the battleship&apos;s sinking on December 7, 1941 – to honor individuals at the UA, as well as after home football games.

In 1993, the team had its first 10-win season and beat the University of Miami Hurricanes in the Fiesta Bowl by a score of 29–0. It was the bowl game&apos;s only shutout in its then 23-year history. In 1998, the team posted a school-record 12–1 season and made the Holiday Bowl in which it defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Arizona ended that season ranked 4th nationally in the coaches and API poll. The 1998 Holiday Bowl was televised on ESPN and set the now-surpassed record of being the most watched of any bowl game in that network&apos;s history (the current record belongs to the 2005 Alamo Bowl between Michigan and Nebraska ). From November 2003 until October 2011, the program was led by Mike Stoops, brother of Bob Stoops, the head football coach at the University of Oklahoma (the 2000 BCS national champions ); Stoops was fired on October 10, 2011. Former Michigan and West Virginia head coach Rich Rodriguez was hired on November 21, 2011 to lead the Wildcats. The announcement was made by UA athletic director Greg Byrne via Twitter. [ Baseball ] [ Arizona Wildcats baseball ] The baseball team had its first season in 1905.

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium. [ Men&apos;s and women&apos;s golf ] The university&apos;s golf teams have also been notably successful. The men&apos;s team won a national championship in 1992 ( NCAA Division I Men&apos;s Golf Championships ), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably Jim Furyk. The women&apos;s team won national championships in 1996 and 2000 ( NCAA Women&apos;s Golf Championship ). Few if any women&apos;s golf programs can boast two more illustrious alumni than the Wildcats&apos; two greatest products— Annika Sörenstam and Lorena Ochoa. [ Men&apos;s lacrosse ] The lacrosse team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, affectionately known as the “Laxcats”. Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with a rich tradition of success. In the 60’s, Arizona was a Division I Varsity program, coached by the legendary Carl Runk, an Arizona graduate and football player. In 1998 Carl retired after twenty-eight years at Towson University in Maryland. [ Other ] Many other Wildcats have met with success at the University. Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women&apos;s Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in ice hockey. The school&apos;s club hockey team, known as the Icecats, has won over 600 games since its inception in 1978. The Icecats defeated Penn State for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They are now part of ACHA Division I. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963. Three national championships for synchronized swimming were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, and not the NCAA. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first NCAA Championship in men and women’s swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007–2008. Topping off these weekends Frank Busch, the men and women’s head coach, was named NCAA Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA’s win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn’s winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, University of Texas took second while 2007’s champion, Auburn University, took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007’s defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona’s women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while Auburn University came in second with 348 and Stanford University in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women&apos;s swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The NCAA Woman of the Year Award was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university. [ Individual national championships ] A number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the NCAA. These include Amanda Beard in 2001 for swimming and Annika Sörenstam in 1991 in golf. The men&apos;s cross country has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ( NCAA Men&apos;s Cross Country Champions ). The women&apos;s cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ( NCAA Women&apos;s Cross Country Championship ). Another notable individual was football standout Vance Johnson who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.Arizona&apos;s first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men&apos;s Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500 yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny swimming won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. [ Rivalries ] A strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and Arizona State University located in Tempe. The UA leads the all-time record against ASU in men&apos;s basketball (145–80), football (47–37–1), and baseball (234–202–1). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as &quot; The Duel in the Desert. &quot; The trophy awarded after each game, the Territorial Cup, is the nation&apos;s oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other Pac-12 teams, especially University of California, Los Angeles which has provided a worthy softball rival and was Arizona&apos;s main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.

From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live bobcat, a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009. [ Fight song ] In 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA&apos;s band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading &quot; BEAR DOWN. &quot; Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed &quot; Bear Down, Arizona! &quot; in public for the first time.

[ Notable venues ] The McKale Center, which opened in 1973, is currently used by men&apos;s and women&apos;s basketball, women&apos;s gymnastics, and women&apos;s volleyball. The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the University of New Mexico, a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program&apos;s winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute&apos;s wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri ( &quot; The Ooh-Aah Man &quot; ) made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. Arizona Stadium, built in 1928 and last expanded in 1976, seats over 56,000 patrons. It hosts American football games and has also been used for university graduations.

Every year (usually in March), the students elect 10 Senators At-Large, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for the nearly 500 student clubs on campus. The organization appoints 4 Directors to serve on the student funded and led Arizona Students&apos; Association. Each of the 10 Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees. } In 1997, the Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the de-facto body to represent issues specific to graduate and professional students. Each year (usually in late March or early April), the graduate and professional students elect 30 representatives by constituency in accordance to College graduate and/or professional student population, with three of those representatives elected at large. The Vice President and President are also elected at large by the graduate and professional student body. Much like ASUA, the GPSC appoints representatives to serve on various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees and 1 Director to serve on the Arizona Students&apos; Association. On-Campus residents also have their own Student Leadership Organization known as the &quot; Residence Hall Association &quot;. {, Uarha.web.arizona.edu } Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual subunits of RHA consist of the hall councils of all 21 residence halls. Each Hall Council is composed of a President, a Director of Programming (for social events), a Director of Operations (for administrative duties), a Director of Sustainability (for recycling duties), and two RHA Representatives who are sent to represent their hall at RHA General Body Meetings. At these meetings, the gathered representatives and RHA Executive Board, elected from within the RHA General Body, discuss issues and make decisions concerning all 6,000 on campus residents. Members of the RHA Executive Board are elected to one-year terms during February and March and are sworn into office at the RHA Banquet usually held during the later part of April. Hall council members and RHA representatives are usually elected by the residents of their respective residence halls during the first 2 weeks of the Fall semester in late August and early September with their term running through the end of the Spring semester in early May. The RHA Executive Board consists of 7 different elected positions (President, Vice President of Public Relations, National Communications Coordinator, Vice President of Finances, Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Services, and Vice President of Programming) along with an appointed Parliamentarian position and an advisor known as the Coordinator for Student Leadership. In 2011, the Residence Hall Association revamped its Executive Board in effort to make the EBoard more parallel to the IACURH Regional Board and NACURH National Board. The Vice President of Finances and Vice President of Operations positions were merged together to form the &quot; Vice President of Business Administration &quot; while a new position formed known as the &quot; Vice President of Training and Development &quot;. The University of Arizona Residence Hall Association has hosted 3 regional IACURH Residence Hall Conferences, which were hosted in 1961, 1997, and 2004. In 2005, the University of Arizona&apos;s Residence Hall Association was voted by NACURH (National Association of College and University Residence Halls) as the National School of the Year out of over 400 schools across the United States. In May 2009, the University of Arizona hosted the NACURH National Residence Hall Conference (also hosted in 1963), bringing more than 2,200 on-campus residents from over 250 schools across the United States and Canada for 3 days of school spirit and learning how to become more sustainable and socially just. The conference theme (Our Place in Time) focused on sustainability and social justice within the residence halls. { Nacurh.org } [ Arizona in film and literature ] The University has made itself known through many films and television appearances. The film Revenge of the Nerds (1984) was filmed at the University of Arizona. In the movie, the Alpha Beta &quot; jock &quot; house was the real-life home to the UA chapter of the Alpha Gamma Rho Fraternity until purchased by the Beta Theta Pi fraternity in 2006. The dorm room (with the balcony) seen in the film is located on the third floor of historic Cochise Hall on campus. When the characters are moving in at the beginning of the movie, the dorm behind the post office drop is Yuma Hall. In the 1994 film Speed, Dennis Hopper refers to Sandra Bullock &apos;s character as a Wildcat because of the emblem on her sweater. In the 1989 film &quot; Leviathan &quot;, Peter Weller &apos;s character, Steven Beck, frequently wears an Arizona Wildcats hat. In the 2006 film You, Me and Dupree, produced by Arizona Alum Scott Stuber, several characters are watching the Arizona Wildcats play football against Washington State University. While playing in their blue uniforms, Arizona scores on a fumble recovery. The film Eating Out was shot around the University of Arizona campus in Tucson. An episode of Little House on the Prairie, entitled &quot; A Wiser Heart, &quot; used Old Main as a prominent backdrop throughout. The final scene of the film Night of the Lepus (1972) features views of the University. The University has also been the setting for portions of David Foster Wallace &apos;s novel Infinite Jest takes place at the University of Arizona campus, including a scene in the administration building satirizing the school&apos;s bureaucracy. Wallace was an alumnus of UA.
