{ Cycle diagram of &apos;&apos;Q&apos;&apos;. Each color specifies a series of powers of any element connected to the identity element (1). For example, the cycle in red reflects the fact that &apos;&apos;i&apos;&apos;   2 = &amp; minus;1, &apos;&apos;i&apos;&apos;   3 = &amp; minus;&apos;&apos;i&apos;&apos;   and &apos;&apos;i&apos;&apos;   4 = 1. The red cycle also reflects the fact that ( &amp; minus;&apos;&apos;i&apos;&apos;  ) 2 = &amp; minus;1, ( &amp; minus;&apos;&apos;i&apos;&apos;  ) 3 = &apos;&apos;i&apos;&apos;   and ( &amp; minus;&apos;&apos;i&apos;&apos;  ) 4 = 1. } In group theory, the quaternion group is a non-abelian group of order eight, isomorphic to a certain eight-element subset of the quaternion s under multiplication. It is often denoted by Q or Q 8, and is given by the group presentation Q = \langle -1,i,j,k \mid (-1)^2 = 1, \;i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 \rangle, \,\! where 1 is the identity element and &amp; minus;1 commutes with the other elements of the group. [ Cayley graph ] The Q 8 group has the same order as the Dihedral group, &apos;&apos;&apos;D 4 &apos;&apos;&apos;, but a different structure, as shown by their Cayley graphs: Cayley graph 240px Q 8 The red arrows represent multiplication on the right by i, and the green arrows represent multiplication on the right by j. 240px D 4 Dihedral group [ Cayley table ] The Cayley table (multiplication table) for Q is given by { See also a table from } { Wolfram Alpha } : 1 &amp; minus;1 i &amp; minus;i j &amp; minus;j k &amp; minus;k 1 1 &amp; minus;1 i &amp; minus;i j &amp; minus;j k &amp; minus;k &amp; minus;1 &amp; minus;1 1 &amp; minus;i i &amp; minus;j j &amp; minus;k k i i &amp; minus;i &amp; minus;1 1 k &amp; minus;k &amp; minus;j j &amp; minus;i &amp; minus;i i 1 &amp; minus;1 &amp; minus;k k j &amp; minus;j j j &amp; minus;j &amp; minus;k k &amp; minus;1 1 i &amp; minus;i &amp; minus;j &amp; minus;j j k &amp; minus;k 1 &amp; minus;1 &amp; minus;i i k k &amp; minus;k j &amp; minus;j &amp; minus;i i &amp; minus;1 1 &amp; minus;k &amp; minus;k k &amp; minus;j j i &amp; minus;i 1 &amp; minus;1 The multiplication of pairs of elements from the subset {±i,  ±j,  ±k} works like the cross product of unit vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space. \begin{alignat}{2} ij &amp; = k, &amp; ji &amp; = -k, \\ jk &amp; = i, &amp; kj &amp; = -i, \\ ki &amp; = j, &amp; ik &amp; = -j. \end{alignat} [ Properties ] The quaternion group has the unusual property of being Hamiltonian : every subgroup of Q is a normal subgroup, but the group is non-abelian. { See Hall (1999), p. 190 } Every Hamiltonian group contains a copy of Q. { See Kurosh (1979), p. 67 } In abstract algebra, one can construct a real four-dimensional vector space with basis {1, i, j, k} and turn it into an associative algebra by using the above multiplication table and distributivity. The result is a skew field called the quaternion s. Note that this is not quite the same as the group algebra on Q (which would be eight-dimensional). Conversely, one can start with the quaternions and define the quaternion group as the multiplicative subgroup consisting of the eight elements {1, &amp; minus;1, i, &amp; minus;i, j, &amp; minus;j, k, &amp; minus;k}. The complex four-dimensional vector space on the same basis is called the algebra of biquaternion s. Note that i, j, and k all have order four in Q and any two of them generate the entire group. Another presentation of Q [ Johnson 1980 pp. 44 –45 ] demonstrating this is: \langle x,y \mid x^4 = 1, x^2 = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}\rangle.\,\! One may take, for instance, i = x, j = y and k = xy. The center and the commutator subgroup of Q is the subgroup {±1}. The factor group Q/{±1} is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V. The inner automorphism group of Q is isomorphic to Q modulo its center, and is therefore also isomorphic to the Klein four-group. The full automorphism group of Q is isomorphic to S 4, the symmetric group on four letters. The outer automorphism group of Q is then S 4 /V which is isomorphic to S 3. [ Matrix representations ] { SL (2,&apos;&apos;&apos; } { C &apos;&apos;&apos;) } The quaternion group can be represented as a subgroup of the general linear group GL 2 (C). A representation Q = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\} \to \mathrm{GL}_{2}(\mathbf{C}) is given by 1 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} i \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} i &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -i \end{pmatrix} j \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} k \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; i \\ i &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} Since all of the above matrices have unit determinant, this is a representation of Q in the special linear group SL 2 (C). The standard identities for quaternion multiplication can be verified using the usual laws of matrix multiplication in GL 2 (C). [ Artin 1991 ] { SL(2,3) } There is also an important action of Q on the eight nonzero elements of the 2-dimensional vector space over the finite field F 3. A representation Q = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\} \to \mathrm{GL}(2,3) is given by 1 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} i \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} j \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} k \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} where { &amp; minus;1,0,1} are the three elements of F 3. Since all of the above matrices have unit determinant over F 3, this is a representation of Q in the special linear group SL(2,  3). Indeed, the group SL(2,  3) has order 24, and Q is a normal subgroup of SL(2,  3) of index 3. [ Galois group ] As Richard Dean showed in 1981, the quaternion group can be presented as the Galois group Gal(T/Q) where Q is the field of rational number s and T is the splitting field, over Q, of the polynomial x^8 - 72 x^6 + 180 x^4 - 144 x^2 + 36. The development uses the fundamental theorem of Galois theory in specifying four intermediate fields between Q and T and their Galois groups, as well as two theorems on cyclic extension of degree four over a field. [ Generalized quaternion group ] A group is called a generalized quaternion group or dicyclic group if it has a presentation \langle x,y \mid x^{2n} = y^4 = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}\rangle.\,\! for some integer n ≥ 2. This group is denoted Q 4n and has order 4n. { Some authors (e.g., } [ Rotman 1995 ] {, pp. 87, 351) refer to this group as the } { dicyclic group, reserving the name generalized quaternion group to the case where n is a power of 2. } Coxeter labels these dicyclic groups &lt; 2,2,n &gt;, being a special case of the binary polyhedral group &lt; l,m,n &gt; and related to the polyhedral group s (p,q,r), and dihedral group (2,2,n). The usual quaternion group corresponds to the case n = 2. The generalized quaternion group can be realized as the subgroup of GL 2 (C) generated by \left(\begin{array}{cc} \omega_n &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \overline{\omega}_n \end{array} \right) \mbox{ and } \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{array} \right) where ω n  = e iπ/n. It can also be realized as the subgroup of unit quaternions generated by [ Brown 1982 ] {, p. 98 } x = e iπ/n and y = j. The generalized quaternion groups have the property that every abelian subgroup is cyclic. [ Brown 1982 ] {, p. 101, exercise 1 } It can be shown that a finite p-group with this property (every abelian subgroup is cyclic) is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group as defined above. [ Cartan Eilenberg 1999 ] {, Theorem 11.6, p. 262 } Another characterization is that a finite p-group in which there is a unique subgroup of order p is either cyclic or generalized quaternion (of order a power of 2). [ Brown 1982 ] {, Theorem 4.3, p. 99 } In particular, for a finite field F with odd characteristic, the 2-Sylow subgroup of SL 2 (F) is non-abelian and has only one subgroup of order 2, so this 2-Sylow subgroup must be a generalized quaternion group, [ Gorenstein 1980 42 ]. Letting p r be the size of F, where p is prime, the size of the 2-Sylow subgroup of SL 2 (F) is 2 n, where n = ord 2 (p 2 - 1) + ord 2 (r). The Brauer-Suzuki theorem shows that groups whose Sylow 2-subgroup is generalized quaternion cannot be simple.
