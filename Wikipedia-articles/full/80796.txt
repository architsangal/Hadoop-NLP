The entire county is included in the Mobile metropolitan statistical area. [ History ] This area was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous people s. The historic Choctaw were among the Native Americans encountered by early French traders and colonists, who founded Mobile in the early eighteenth century. The British took over the territory in 1763 after defeating the French in the Seven Years War. During the American Revolutionary War, it came under Spanish rule as part of Spanish Florida. It was ceded to the United States after the War of 1812. Most of the Native Americans in the area were removed in the 1830s under President Andrew Jackson &apos;s policy to relocate them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. The MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians was recognized as a tribe in 1979 by the state; it occupies land along the border of Mobile and Washington counties. Mobile County was created by European Americans by a proclamation of Governor Holmes of the Mississippi Territory on December 18, 1812.
