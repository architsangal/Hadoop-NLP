[ Coed ] Mixed-sex education, also known as coeducation, is the integrated education of male and female students in the same institution. It is the opposite of single-sex education. Most older institutions of higher education were reserved for the male sex and since then have changed their policies to become coeducative. [ China ] The first mixed-sex institution of higher learning in China was the Nanjing Higher Normal School, which was renamed National Central University and Nanjing University. For millennia in China, public schools, especially public higher learning schools, were for men. Generally only schools established by zongzu (宗族, gens) were for both male and female students. Some schools such as Li Zhi &apos;s school in Ming Dynasty and Yuan Mei &apos;s school in Qing Dynasty enrolled both male and female students. In the 1910s women&apos;s universities were established such as Ginling Women&apos;s University and Peking Girls&apos; Higher Normal School, but there were no coeducation in higher learning schools. Tao Xingzhi, the Chinese advocator of mixed-sex education, proposed The Audit Law for Women Students (規定女子旁聽法案) at the meeting of Nanjing Higher Normal School held on December seventh, 1919. He also proposed that the university recruit female students. The idea was supported by the president Guo Bingwen, academic director Liu Boming, and such famous professors as Lu Zhiwei and Yang Xingfo, but opposed by many famous men of the time. The meeting passed the law and decided to recruit women students next year. Nanjing Higher Normal School enrolled eight Chinese female students in 1920. In the same year Peking University also began to allow women students to audit classes. One of the most notable female students of that time was Jianxiong Wu. In 1949, the People&apos;s Republic of China was founded. The Chinese government has provided more equal opportunities for education since then, [ July 2009 ] and all schools and universities have become mixed-sex. In recent years, however, many female and/or single-sex schools have again emerged for special vocational training needs but equal rights for education still apply to all citizens. In China Muslim Hui and Muslim Salars are against coeducation, due to Islam, Uyghur s are the only Muslims in China that do not mind coeducation and practice it.

Mixed-sex education became mandatory for primary schools in 1957 and for all universities in 1975. { http://ettajdid.org/spip.php?article138 } [ Hong Kong ] St. Paul&apos;s Co-educational College was the first mixed-sex secondary school in Hong Kong. It was founded in 1915 as St. Paul&apos;s Girls&apos; College. At the end of World War II it was temporarily merged with St. Paul&apos;s College, which is a boys&apos; school. When classes at the campus of St. Paul&apos;s College were resumed, it continued to be mixed, and changed to its present name.

The Scottish Dollar Academy claims to be the first (non quaker?) mixed-sex boarding school in the UK (in 1818) [ March 2012 ]. Many previously single-sex school s have begun to accept both sexes in the past few decades; for example, Clifton College began to accept women in 1987. [ Higher education institutions ] The first United Kingdom university to allow ladies to enter on equal terms with gentlemen, and hence be admitted to academic degrees, was University College London in 1878, with degrees being conferred upon the United Kingdom&apos;s first four female graduates in 1880. { pages XVII to XVIII of The University of London and the World of Learning, 1836-1986 By Francis Michael Longstreth ThompsonContributor Francis Michael Longstreth ThompsonPublished by Continuum International Publishing Group, 1990 ISBN 978-1-85285-032-6 } The first institution engaged in educating students, given the University of London&apos;s then role was an examining authority, to become fully co-educational was University College London in 1878. Given their dual role as both boarding house and educational establishment, individual colleges at Oxford and Cambridge remained segregated for much longer periods. The first Oxford college to house both men and women was the graduate-only Nuffield College in 1937, with the first five undergraduate colleges (including St Catherine&apos;s ) becoming mixed in 1974. The first mixed Cambridge college was the graduate-only Darwin from its foundation in 1964. Churchill, Clare and King&apos;s colleges of Cambridge were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduate s in 1972. Magdalene was the last all-male college to become mixed in 1988.

Mixed-sex classes were admitted to the preparatory department at Oberlin in 1833 and the college department in 1837.

Later, in 1862, the first black woman to receive a bachelor&apos;s degree ( Mary Jane Patterson ) also earned it from Oberlin College. Beginning in 1844, Hillsdale College became the second college to admit mixed-sex classes to four-year degree programs.

May University of Rochester History http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE%3D2319 ] and for much of the next century, public universities, and land grant universities in particular, would lead the way in mixed-sex higher education. There were also many private coeducational universities founded in the 19th century, especially west of the Mississippi River. East of the Mississippi, Cornell University admitted its first female student in 1870. [ http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/index.php?p%3D36 Our History 2010-02-21 ] Around the same time, single-sex women&apos;s colleges were also appearing. According to Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra: &quot; women&apos;s college s were founded during the mid- and late-19th century in response to a need for advanced education for women at a time when they were not admitted to most institutions of higher education. &quot; { http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html } Notable examples include the prestigious Seven Sisters, of which Vassar College is now coeducational and Radcliffe College has merged with Harvard University. Other notable women&apos;s colleges that have become coeducational include Wheaton College in Massachusetts, Ohio Wesleyan Female College in Ohio, Skidmore College, Wells College, and Sarah Lawrence College in New York state, Goucher College in Maryland, and Connecticut College. [ Primary and secondary schools ] Several early primary and secondary school s in the United States were single-sex. One example is Collegiate School, a boys&apos; school operating in New York by 1638 (at the latest). Nonetheless, mixed-sex education existed at these levels in the U.S. long before it extended to colleges. For example, in 1787, the predecessor to Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, opened as a mixed-sex secondary school.

Among the latter was Rebecca Gratz, the first Jewish female college student in the United States. [ February 2010 ] However, the school soon began having financial problems and it reopened as an all-male institution. Westford Academy in Westford, Massachusetts has operated as mixed-sex secondary school since its founding in 1792.

This usage reflects the historical process by which female pupils who were admitted to schools originally reserved for boys and vise versa, leading to the culture identified students of the newly admitted gender as &quot; coed&apos;s &quot; because it was they who were identified with making schools &quot; coeducational &quot;. The word is also often used to describe a situation in which both sexes are integrated in any form (e.g., &quot; The team is coed &quot; ). In American culture, the term &quot; coed &quot; is also widely used as a generic slang term to describe a college female in particular.
