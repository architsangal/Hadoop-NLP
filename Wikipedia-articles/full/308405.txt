Layfield is best known by his ring names, Bradshaw, John &quot; Bradshaw &quot; Layfield or JBL while working for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he was the longest reigning WWE Champion in SmackDown history with a reign lasting 280 days. Layfield&apos;s main gimmick as John &quot; Bradshaw &quot; Layfield (JBL) – a wealthy, gladhanding, big-mouthed, fiery-tempered businessman – was based on Layfield&apos;s real-life accomplishments as a stock market investor. Layfield is a regular panelist on Fox News Channel &apos;s The Cost of Freedom, has appeared on CNBC, and has written a best-selling book on financial planning called Have More Money Now. (ISBN 0-7434-6633-0). Layfield also hosts a weekend talk radio program, syndicated nationally by Talk Radio Network, in which he discusses his conservative political views. { Talk Radio Network: Hosts } Layfield is also employed by Northeast Securities as its Senior Vice President. { istria camping quantitative analysis pula at reiresearch.com } In WWE, Layfield won 24 total championships including one reign as WWE Champion, one reign as United States Champion, one reign as European Champion, seventeen reigns as Hardcore Champion, one reign as Intercontinental Champion, and three reigns as World Tag Team Champion with Faarooq as part of the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA). He is also recognized as the twentieth Triple Crown Champion, and the tenth Grand Slam Champion. [ Football ] Prior to his professional wrestling career, Layfield was a collegiate American football coach for Trinity Valley Community College and player for Abilene Christian University. { July 2005 - Abilene Christian University } At Abilene, Layfield was a two-year starter on the offensive line and was named first-team All- Lone Star Conference as a junior and senior. Layfield signed with the Los Angeles Raiders as an undrafted free agent, but was released before the 1990 season began. Layfield did play in the World League of American Football, starting all ten games of the 1991 season at right tackle for the San Antonio Riders, wearing jersey number 61. [ Professional wrestling career ] [ Global Wrestling Federation (1992–1994) ] Layfield was trained initially by Brad Rheingans and first started wrestling in the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in Texas. His first gimmick was as Johnny Hawk, storyline cousin of the Windham brothers. He formed the tag team &quot; Texas Mustangs &quot; with Bobby Duncum, Jr.; they quickly won the GWF Tag Team Championship from Rough Riders ( Black Bart and Johnny MantellE) on November 27 but dropped the titles to Bad Breed ( Ian and Axl Rotten ) on January 29, 1993. Later that year, Hawk won his second GWF Tag Team Championship with Black Bart on December 25 from Steve Dane and Chaz Taylor. They held the title for a long time before losing them to The Fabulous Freebirds ( Jimmy Garvin and Terry Gordy ) on June 3, 1994. Layfield also won the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship on January 14, 1995, defeating Kevin Von Erich.

[ http://www.wrestlecrap.com/oldinductions.html Previous Inductions - Been There, Crapped That Wrestlecrap 2009-07-26 ] After victories, he branded his opponents with the symbol &quot; JB &quot; in ink, rather than being seared into the flesh. Managed by Uncle Zebekiah, the character fizzled out by the end of the year, perhaps remembered only for a feud with Savio Vega and a match with Fatu which he won in eight seconds. Layfield paired up with his storyline cousin Barry Windham to form The New Blackjacks, complete with the traditional &quot; Blackjack &quot; handlebar mustaches and short, jet black hair. [ http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/blackjacks-new.html The New Blackjacks Profile Online World of Wrestling 2008-04-26 ] Windham&apos;s injuries piled up throughout 1997, so the team disbanded, and Layfield wrestled only occasionally on TV as &quot; Blackjack Bradshaw &quot;, sometimes teaming with fellow Texan Terry Funk.

As part of the Ministry, Bradshaw feuded with Ken Shamrock. The two stables would soon unite as the Corporate Ministry, but disbanded after Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Undertaker at Fully Loaded. When the Undertaker went on hiatus in September, Bradshaw and Faarooq&apos;s dark gimmick faded. On the May 31, 1999 episode of Raw is War, the Acolytes (still with the Corporate Ministry) won their first WWF Tag Team Championship by defeating Kane and X-Pac.

The duo became fan favorites and changed their gimmick to cigar-smoking, bar-brawlers-for-hire. In jeans and t-shirts, Faarooq and Bradshaw became the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA), with a motto of &quot; because we need beer money. &quot; The duo was often seen in the backrooms of arenas with a poker table and later a framed doorway comically in the middle of the often large, open aired hallways; they insisted that anyone entering the space use the door. Occasionally, if the &quot; room &quot; was destroyed in one arena, it was set up exactly as it was destroyed at the next arena, pushing continuity through time and space for comic effect. The Acolytes earned a shot at the WWF Tag Title at the Royal Rumble against the New Age Outlaws ( Road Dogg and Billy Gunn ), but lost the match.

Layfield was drafted to Raw where his Bradshaw gimmick had an increased emphasis on his Texas roots, which included him carrying a cowbell to the ring. Bradshaw joined the hardcore division after debuting on Raw and won the WWE Hardcore Championship seventeen times, with his first title win coming over Steven Richards. [ http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/hard/ WWE Hardcore Championship official title history WWE 2008-04-26 ] He renamed the title the Texas Hardcore Championship. It was also during this time that his finishing move was briefly renamed from the &quot; Clothesline From Hell &quot; to the &quot; Clothesline From Texas &quot; or the &quot; Clothesline From Deep in the Heart of Texas &quot;. Jim Ross often called the move as such during his commentary, although the name eventually reverted back to the original &quot; Clothesline From Hell &quot;. In the hardcore division, Bradshaw feuded and exchanged the title with the likes of Richards, Shawn Stasiak, Raven, Christopher Nowinski, Big Show, Justin Credible, Johnny Stamboli, Crash Holly, Jeff Hardy, and Tommy Dreamer, before the title was unified by WWE Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam in August 2002. In September 2002, Layfield suffered a torn left biceps at a house show. He was out of action for six months until returning to Ohio Valley Wrestling and then a few weeks later to the active WWE roster. [ APA reunion (2003–2004) ] Bradshaw returned on an episode of SmackDown! in 2003, which saw him and his old friend Faarooq saving the Undertaker from the hands of Chuck Palumbo and Johnny Stamboli. Layfield returned with a new look by cutting his long hair, returning it to its natural color, and going clean shaven. His new look would only be referenced once when, in a scripted segment, Faarooq asked him directly about it. Bradshaw insisted that he had already told the story to Faarooq, who rejected this claim. The duo would return to perform their regular segments, as they did before the brand extension, such as playing poker, drinking beer, and bribing superstars of their money. Unlike before, they would not attack or protect other superstars at the employ of other superstars as none would hire them. At Vengeance, Bradshaw won a bar room brawl match which featured Faarooq and a variety of mid-card superstars and other WWE employees. { Online World of Wrestling } The duo wrestled tag teams such as the Basham Brothers ( Doug and Danny ) at No Mercy [ http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2003/results/ No Mercy 2003 official results WWE 2008-04-27 ] and The World&apos;s Greatest Tag Team ( Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin ) at No Way Out.

Frustrated by the APA&apos;s insult, Heyman told Faarooq that if he did not win the aforementioned match, then &quot; You&apos;re Fired &quot;. After the match, Bradshaw led Faarooq back to Heyman&apos;s office to state they had not been fired, but had resigned. Then Heyman cleared up the mis-understanding and pointed out that he said that if they did not win the titles, then he told Faarooq &quot; You&apos;re fired. &quot; His reason for saying this directly to Faarooq was because it applied only to Faarooq because &quot; WWE Management &quot; still saw a lot of potential in Bradshaw. He left them after telling Bradshaw to think about his own future. Faarooq shouted after Heyman that he was not fired because they (Faarooq and Bradshaw) had quit. But Bradshaw hesitated. Faarooq took Bradshaw&apos;s hesitation to mean that he would not resign, and so Faarooq promptly disbanded the APA and left. In reality, the WWE had decided to stop using Ron Simmons as an on-air performer. He was initially fired, but he was later re-hired to work behind the scenes in the WWE under various roles. [ JBL; The Cabinet (2004–2005) ] [ The Cabinet (professional wrestling) ] { WWE Champion. } After Faarooq was fired from WWE, Bradshaw changed his gimmick into a J. R. Ewing esque as a villain persona complete with a suit, cowboy hat, and tie as he began his first main event push. He began referring to himself as John &quot; Bradshaw &quot; Layfield, or JBL. His finishing move&apos;s name was part of the overhaul, becoming the Clothesline From Wall Street until he later changed it back to its original name.

The storyline leading up to the match was that JBL caused Guerrero&apos;s mother to have a heart attack at a house show when he threatened her and grabbed her by the shoulder. At Judgment Day, JBL defeated Guerrero via disqualification in a match for Eddie&apos;s WWE title. A title cannot change hands by DQ, so Guerrero retained the title.
