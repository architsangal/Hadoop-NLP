Spungen has been the subject of controversy among music historians and fans of the Sex Pistols. [ Early life ] Spungen was born at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, { And I Don&apos;t Want to Live This Life by } { Deborah Spungen } to Frank and Deborah Spungen. She was born with severe cyanosis and nearly died of oxygen deprivation after being choked by her umbilical cord during delivery. She was spared from brain damage and released from the hospital eight days after birth. The Spungens were a middle class Jew ish family that resided in Lower Moreland Township, a suburb of Philadelphia. { Beeber, Steven Lee. &quot; The heebie-jeebies at CBGB&apos;s: a secret history of Jewish punk &quot; 2006. } Her father was a traveling salesman; her mother later owned an organic food store called The Earth Shop in nearby Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. She was a difficult baby, throwing crying fits and temper tantrums late into childhood. At three months old, she was prescribed a liquid barbiturate by a pediatrician, but her violent behavior persisted. In an interview, Deborah Spungen stated, &quot; I know it&apos;s normal for babies to scream, but Nancy did nothing but scream. &quot; She scored &quot; superior &quot; on an intelligence quotient test at five years of age, and was allowed to skip the third grade. Though she excelled academically, she had few friends during her elementary school years. She was a temperamental child who exhibited violent behavior toward her younger sister, Susan, and brother, David.

At age 11, she was expelled from public schooling when she was absent from class more than two weeks. Her parents, weary of her erratic behavior, enrolled her at the Devereux Glenholme School and Devereux Manor High School. In January 1972, she ran away from Devereux Manor and attempted suicide by slitting her wrists with scissors. When Spungen was 15, her psychiatrist diagnosed her with schizophrenia. { Nancy Spungen by Deborah Spungen } [ Education ] Spungen graduated at Devereux Manor High School in April 1974, and her application to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder was accepted two weeks earlier. She began attending the university at the age of 16; however, five months into her freshman year, she was arrested for purchasing marijuana from an undercover police officer. She was later arrested for storing stolen property in her dorm room, and she was then expelled from the University of Colorado. Her father traveled to Boulder and accepted a plea bargain for Nancy, which resulted in her being banished from the state of Colorado. After being fired from her first job on the first day, she began financing herself by stealing from her family and dealing drugs. [ Relationship with Sid Vicious ] Spungen left home at age 17 and moved to New York City. She worked as a stripper around Times Square (and allegedly at a brothel as well). { An unofficial website about Nancy Spungen: } She followed bands such as Aerosmith, The New York Dolls and The Ramones. In 1976, she moved to London, allegedly to win over Jerry Nolan of the Dolls and The Heartbreakers, but met The Sex Pistols instead. { Schoemer, Karen. &quot; The Day Punk Died &quot; } { New York (magazine) October 19, 2008. } When lead singer Johnny Rotten did not show interest in her, she pursued bassist Sid Vicious and they soon moved in together. [ October 2011 ] During a tumultuous 23-month relationship, Spungen and Vicious became addicted to heroin and other drugs. Vicious was already abusing multiple drugs before he met Spungen. Sources claim that he had begun to use speed with his mother at an early age. The tabloids dubbed Spungen &quot; Nauseating Nancy &quot; for her frequent public displays of verbal abuse and violence. After the Sex Pistols broke up in January 1978, Spungen and Vicious moved to the Hotel Chelsea in New York City. They stayed in room 100 and were registered under Mr. and Mrs. John Simon Ritchie, Vicious&apos;s real name. { Orin, Deborah. &quot; Sid Vicious Seized at Chelsea Hotel &quot; } { New York Post October 13, 1978. } There, Vicious tried, with limited success, to continue his musical career. [ Death ] Over the next few months, Vicious and Spungen spiraled into deeper drug abuse, punctuated by domestic violence within which Vicious allegedly attacked Spungen. Their relationship ended violently on October 12, 1978, when Spungen was found under the sink in the bathroom of their hotel room, dead from a single stab wound to the abdomen, later traced to a knife owned by Vicious. { Steward, Sue. &quot; Sid and Nancy: The Habitat Years &quot; } { The Telegraph June 5, 2008. } This was reportedly a &quot; 007 &quot; hunting knife he had obtained after seeing Dee Dee Ramone give one to The Dead Boys &apos; Stiv Bators, although conflicting reports claim the knife to be a Jaguar K-11 with a five-inch blade. { Bruno, Anthony. &quot; Punk Rock Romeo and Juliet: Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen &quot; TruTV Crime Library } { Bardach, Ann. &quot; The Not So Lonesome Death of Nancy Spungen &quot; The Soho Weekly News October 28, 1978. } Vicious was immediately arrested and charged with second degree murder. Vicious pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. { 1978: &quot; Sex Pistols Vicious on Murder Charge &quot; } { BBC October 12, 1978. } Four months after Nancy&apos;s death, incarceration at Riker&apos;s Island before bail and drug rehabilitation, he overdosed taking a lethal amount of heroin, and died before the trial could take place. { &quot; 1979: Sid Vicious dies from drugs overdose &quot; } { BBC } { 1978: &quot; Sex Pistols Vicious on Murder Charge &quot; } { BBC October 12, 1978. } After Vicious died the police closed the case. { Allen, Liam. &quot; Did Sid Kill Nancy? &quot; } { BBC News February 2, 2009. } Nancy was buried in her hometown in Philadelphia, { Hershkovits, David and Vinson, Lesley. &quot; He Said He Was Going to Kill &quot; Soho News Weekly October 19-25, 1978. } Her Hebrew name is inscripted on her gravestone: &quot; Haya-Leah daughter of Ephrayim-Aharon &quot;. { A young woman is dead. I don’t care. You probably don’t care. The police don’t care. The papers don’t care. The punks for the most part don’t care. The only people that care are (I suppose) her parents and (I’m almost certain) the boy accused of murdering her. –– } { Lester Bangs, on Nancy Spungen&apos;s murder } There are several theories that Spungen was murdered by someone else, usually said to be one of the two drug dealers who visited the apartment that night, and involving a possible robbery, as certain items (including a substantial bankroll) were claimed to be missing from the room. { Scott, Paul. &quot; Did Sid Really Kill Nancy? Explosive New Evidence Suggests Punk Rocker Innocent &quot; } { The Daily Mail January 23, 2009. } In his book, Pretty Vacant: A History of Punk, Phil Strongman accuses actor and stand-up comic Rockets Redglare of killing Spungen. Redglare had delivered 40 capsules of hydromorphone to the couple&apos;s room at the Chelsea Hotel the night of Spungen&apos;s death. Redglare steadfastly denied any involvement in the murder of Nancy Spungen throughout his life. He stated that the other dealer known to have been there that evening had left before him to obtain more heroin, and was due back after he had left the building. He said he believed that the other dealer returned, found Vicious out cold, and attempted to steal the remaining drugs, leading to a confrontation with Spungen. In his review for director Alex Cox &apos;s film, Sid and Nancy, critic Roger Ebert speculated that Spungen&apos;s stab wound was not severe enough to cause death, but she was a hemophiliac, and because her blood wouldn&apos;t clot, she bled to death. He further stated that he didn&apos;t believe Vicious&apos; intention was to kill Spungen, but rather that it was an accident { http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19861025/REVIEWS/501067548/1023 } In the film, Cox also put forth the theory that Spungen and Vicious had a suicide pact, but they got into an argument when Vicious reneged. The argument escalated when Spungen assaulted Vicious, who was trying to leave the apartment, and that she was actually stabbed accidentally when she charged him when his knife was out. Subsequent scenes show Spungen sleeping with Sid even while she is bleeding to death. [ Related works ] And I Don&apos;t Want to Live This Life, by Deborah Spungen (Nancy&apos;s mother), was published in 1983. The title of the memoir is taken from a poem written by Vicious after Spungen&apos;s death. [ December 2010 ] Rats by Veronica Schanoes, appeared in the 2007 Interstitial Arts Foundation anthology Interfictions. The story is a punk rock fairytale inspired by Spungen&apos;s life. About her work, the author said &quot; I wrote Rats because I was angry with the way the recent coffee-table histories of punk seem to have no problem demonizing a dead, mentally ill, teenage girl. &quot; [ Interfictions: An Anthology of Interstitial Writing edited by Delia Sherman and Theodora Goss http://www.bookslut.com/fiction/2007_07_011497.php ] Sid and Nancy, a biopic directed by Alex Cox, was released in 1986.

Woolston published an academic essay examining Nancy Spungen&apos;s life from a feminist perspective.

Spungen&apos;s life is also examined as it relates to songstress Courtney Love&apos;s within the essay. The piece appears in the special &quot; women of punk rock &quot; issue of Women&apos;s Studies Interdiciplinary Journal.
