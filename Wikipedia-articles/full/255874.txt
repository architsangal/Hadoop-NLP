[ 2001 9 ] { yes } { Objective-C, } { Cocoa } { Mac OS X } { multilingual AboutAdium - Adium - Trac } { Instant messaging } { client } { GNU General Public License } Adium is a free and open source instant messaging client for Mac OS X that supports multiple IM networks, including Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk, AIM, ICQ, XMPP and OTR. It supports many protocol s through the libraries libezv (for Bonjour ), MGTwitterEngine (for Twitter ), and libpurple (for all other protocols). It is written using Mac OS X&apos;s Cocoa API, and it is released under the GNU General Public License and many other licenses for components that are distributed with Adium. [ History ] Adium was created by college student Adam Iser, and the first version, &quot; Adium 1.0 &quot;, was released in September 2001 and supported only AIM. The version numbers of Adium since then have followed a somewhat unusual pattern. There were several upgrades to Adium 1.0, ending with Adium 1.6.2c. [ http://trac.adium.im/wiki/Adium1xChangelog Adium1xChangelog The Adium Project 2009-03-14 ] At this point, the Adium team began a complete rewrite of the Adium code, expanding it into a multiprotocol messaging program. Pidgin &apos;s (formerly &quot; Gaim &quot; ) libpurple (then called &quot; libgaim &quot; ) library was implemented to add support for IM protocols other than AIM – since then, the Adium team mostly works on the GUI. The Adium team originally intended to release these changes as &quot; Adium 2.0 &quot;. However, Adium was eventually renamed to &quot; Adium X &quot; and released at version 0.50, being considered &quot; halfway to a 1.0 product &quot;. [ http://trac.adium.im/wiki/HistoryOfAdium History Of Adium The Adium Project 2009-01-31 ] Adium X 0.88 was the first version compiled as a universal binary, allowing it to run natively on Intel -based Macs. After version Adium X 0.89.1, however, the team finally decided to change the name back to &quot; Adium &quot;, and, as such, &quot; Adium 1.0 &quot; was released on February 2, 2007.

These plugins include functionality such as file transfer, support for the Growl notifications system, Sparkle for program updates, and support for encrypted messaging with the Off-the-Record Messaging library. Adium is also highly customizable through the use of resources its developers call &quot; Xtras &quot;. The program can be customized by the use of hundreds of third-party Xtras that alter the appearance of emoticon s, dock icons, contact list styles, and messages styles. Adium can also be enhanced through the use of different sound sets. AppleScript s can also be utilized to automatically alter behavior in responses to certain triggers.
