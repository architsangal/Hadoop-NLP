{ Zebrafish chromatophores mediate } { background adaptation on exposure to dark (top) and light environments (bottom). } Chromatophores are pigment -containing and light-reflecting cells found in amphibian s, fish, reptile s, crustacean s, and cephalopod s. They are largely responsible for generating skin and eye colour in cold-blooded animals and are generated in the neural crest during embryonic development. Mature chromatophores are grouped into subclasses based on their colour (more properly &quot; hue &quot; ) under white light: xanthophores (yellow), erythrophores (red), iridophores ( reflective / iridescent ), leucophores (white), melanophores (black/brown) and cyanophores (blue). The term can also refer to coloured, membrane associated vesicles found in some forms of photosynthetic bacteria. Some species can rapidly change colour through mechanisms that translocate pigment and reorient reflective plates within chromatophores. This process, often used as a type of camouflage, is called physiological colour change or metachrosis. [ Scott M. Boback &amp; Lynn M. Siefferman 2010 Variation in Color and Color Change in Island and Mainland Boas (Boa constrictor) Journal of Herpetology 44 4 506 –515 10.1670/09-026.1 ] Cephalopods such as octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this, while vertebrates such as chameleon s generate a similar effect by cell signaling. Such signals can be hormone s or neurotransmitter s and may be initiated by changes in mood, temperature, stress or visible changes in local environment. Unlike cold-blooded animals, mammal s and bird s have only one class of chromatophore-like cell type: the melanocyte. The cold-blooded equivalent, melanophores, are studied by scientists to understand human disease and used as a tool in drug discovery. [ History ] Aristotle mentioned the ability of the octopus to change colour for both camouflage and signalling in his Historia animalium (ca 400 BC): { Aristotle. Historia Animalium. IX, 622a: 2-10. About 400 BC. Cited in Luciana Borrelli, Francesca Gherardi, Graziano Fiorito. A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda. Firenze University Press, 2006. Abstract Google books } [ The octopus... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed. ] G. Sangiovanni was the first to describe invertebrate pigment-bearing cells as [ it chromoforo ] in an Italian science journal in 1819. { Sangiovanni G. Descrizione di un particolare sistema di organi cromoforo espansivo-dermoideo e dei fenomeni che esso produce, scoperto nei molluschi cefaloso. G. Enciclopedico Napoli. 1819; 9:1–13. } Charles Darwin described the colour-changing abilities of the cuttlefish in The Voyage of the Beagle (1860): [ Journal Of Researches Into The Natural History And Geology Of The Countries Visited During The Voyage Round The World Of H.M.S. &apos;Beagle&apos; Under The Command Of Captain Fitz Roy, R.N. John Murray, London Darwin, Charles Chapter 1. Habits of a Sea-slug and Cuttle-fish. 7 1860 ] [ These animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of changing their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their general shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green. The colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner that clouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, were continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids. ] [ Classification ] The term chromatophore was adopted (following Sangiovanni&apos;s chromoforo) as the name for pigment bearing cells derived from the neural crest of cold-blooded vertebrate s and cephalopods. The word itself comes from the Greek words [ el-Latn khrōma ] ( [ el χρωμα ] ) meaning &quot; colour, &quot; and [ el-Latn phoros ] ( [ el φορος ] ) meaning &quot; bearing &quot;. In contrast, the word chromatocyte (cyte or [ el κυτε ] being Greek for &quot; cell &quot; ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals. Only one such cell type, the melanocyte, has been identified in these animals. It wasn&apos;t until the 1960s that the structure and colouration of chromatophores were understood well enough to allow the development of a system of sub-classification based on their appearance. This classification system persists to this day even though more recent studies have revealed that certain biochemical aspects of the pigments may be more useful to a scientific understanding of how the cells function. [ 10.1016/S0074-7696(08)60801-3 Bagnara JT., 1966 Cytology and cytophysiology of non-melanophore pigment cells Int Rev Cytol 20 173–205 5337298 International Review of Cytology 978-0-12-364320-9 ] Colour-producing molecules fall into two distinct classes: biochromes and schemochrome s. { Fox, DL. Animal Biochromes and Structural Colors: Physical, Chemical, Distributional &amp; Physiological Features of Colored Bodies in the Animal World. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1976. ISBN 0-520-02347-1 } The biochromes include true pigments, such as carotenoid s and pteridine s. These pigments selectively absorb parts of the visible light spectrum that makes up white light while permitting other wavelength s to reach the eye of the observer. Schemochromes, also known as &quot; structural colours &quot;, produce colouration by reflecting some wavelengths (colours) of light and transmitting others, by causing light waves to interfere within the structure or by scattering light which falls upon them. While all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures (except when there has been a genetic mutation resulting in a disorder like albinism ), not all pigment containing cells are chromatophores. Haem, for example, is a biochrome responsible for the red appearance of blood. It is primarily found in red blood cell s (erythrocytes), which are generated in bone marrow throughout the life of an organism, rather than being formed during embryological development. Therefore erythrocytes are not classified as chromatophores. { veiled chameleon, &apos;&apos;Chamaeleo calyptratus&apos;&apos;. Structural green and blue colours are generated by overlaying chromatophore types to reflect filtered light. } [ Xanthophores and erythrophores ] Chromatophores that contain large amounts of yellow pteridine pigments are named xanthophores; those with a preponderance of red / orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores. Pteridine and carotenoid containing vesicles are sometimes found within the same cell, in which case the overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments. [ Matsumoto J, 1965 STUDIES ON FINE STRUCTURE AND CYTOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ERYTHROPHORES IN SWORDTAIL, XIPHOPHORUS HELLERI, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THEIR PIGMENT GRANULES (PTERINOSOMES) J Cell Biol 27 3 493–504 5885426 2106771 10.1083/jcb.27.3.493 ] Therefore, the distinction between these chromatophore types is not always clear. The capacity to generate pteridines from guanosine triphosphate is a feature common to most chromatophores, but xanthophores appear to have supplemental biochemical pathways that result in an excess accumulation of yellow pigment. In contrast, carotenoids are metabolised from the diet and transported to erythrophores. This was first demonstrated by rearing normally green frogs on a diet of carotene -restricted cricket s. The absence of carotene in the frogs&apos; diet meant the red/orange carotenoid colour &apos;filter&apos; was not present in their erythrophores. This resulted in the frogs appearing blue in colour, instead of green. { Bagnara JT. Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Pigment Cells in Nonmammalian Tissues. In: The Pigmentary System: Physiology and Pathophysiology, } { Oxford University Press, 1998. ISBN 0-19-509861-7 } [ Iridophores and leucophores ] Iridophores, sometimes also called guanophores, are pigment cells that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine. [ 10.1016/0016-6480(69)90157-9 Taylor JD., 1969 The effects of intermedin on the ultrastructure of amphibian iridophores Gen Comp Endocrinol 12 3 405–16 5769930 ] When illuminated they generate iridescent colours because of the diffraction of light within the stacked plates. Orientation of the schemochrome determines the nature of the colour observed. [ 10.1111/j.1600-0749.1995.tb00771.x Morrison RL., 1995 A transmission electron microscopic (TEM) method for determining structural colors reflected by lizard iridophores Pigment Cell Res 8 1 28–36 7792252 ] By using biochromes as coloured filters, iridophores create an optical effect known as Tyndall or Rayleigh scattering, producing bright blue or green colours. A related type of chromatophore, the leucophore, is found in some fish, particularly in the tapetum lucidum. Like iridophores, they utilize crystalline purine s (often guanine) to reflect light. Unlike iridophores, however, leucophores have more organized crystals which reduce diffraction. Given a source of white light, they produce a white shine. As with xanthophores and erythrophores, in fish the distinction between iridophores and leucophores is not always obvious, but generally iridophores are considered to generate iridescent or metallic colours while leucophores produce reflective white hues. [ Melanophores ] { mutant zebrafish larva that fails to synthesise melanin in its melanophores, at the top a non-mutant, wildtype larva. } [ Melanocyte ] Melanophores contain eumelanin, a type of melanin, that appears black or dark brown because of its light absorbing qualities. It is packaged in vesicles called melanosomes and distributed throughout the cell. Eumelanin is generated from tyrosine in a series of catalysed chemical reactions. It is a complex chemical containing units of dihydroxyindole and dihydroxyindole-2- carboxylic acid with some pyrrole rings. [ 10.1034/j.1600-0749.2003.00072.x Ito S Wakamatsu K. 2003 Quantitative analysis of eumelanin and pheomelanin in humans, mice, and other animals: a comparative review Pigment Cell Res 16 5 523–31 12950732 ] The key enzyme in melanin synthesis is tyrosinase. When this protein is defective, no melanin can be generated resulting in certain types of albinism. In some amphibian species there are other pigments packaged alongside eumelanin. For example, a novel deep (wine) red coloured pigment was identified in the melanophores of phyllomedusine frogs. [ 10.1126/science.182.4116.1034 Bagnara J.T. Taylor 1973 JD Prota G Color changes, unusual melanosomes, and a new pigment from leaf frogs http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/182/4116/1034 Science 182 4116 1034–5 4748673 ] This was subsequently identified as pterorhodin, a pteridine dimer that accumulates around eumelanin core, and it is also present in a variety of tree frog species from Australia and Papua New Guinea. While it is likely that other lesser studied species have complex melanophore pigments, it is nevertheless true that the majority of melanophores studied to date do contain eumelanin exclusively. [ Bagnara J.T. 2003 Enigmas of Pterorhodin, a Red Melanosomal Pigment of Tree Frogs Pigment Cell Research 16 12950730 5 510–516 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mksg/pcr/2003/00000016/00000005/art00014 10.1034/j.1600-0749.2003.00075.x ] Humans have only one class of pigment cell, the mammalian equivalent of melanophores, to generate skin, hair and eye colour. For this reason, and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise, melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore. However, there are differences between the biology of melanophores and melanocyte s. In addition to eumelanin, melanocytes can generate a yellow/red pigment called phaeomelanin. { Pseudochromis diadema &apos;&apos;, generates its } { violet stripe with an unusual type of chromatophore } [ Cyanophores ] In 1995 it was demonstrated that the vibrant blue colours in some types of mandarinfish are not generated by schemochromes. Instead, a cyan biochrome of unknown chemical nature is responsible. This pigment, found within vesicles in at least two species of callionymid fish, is highly unusual in the animal kingdom, as all other blue colourings thus far investigated are schemochromatic. Therefore a novel chromatophore type, the cyanophore, was proposed. Although they appear unusual in their taxonomic restriction, there may be cyanophores (as well as further unusual chromatophore types) in other fish and amphibians. For example, bright coloured chromatophores with undefined pigments have been observed in both poison dart frog s and glass frog s, [ 10.1126/science.860137 Schwalm PA, Starrett 1977 PH McDiarmid RW Infrared reflectance in leaf-sitting neotropical frogs Science 196 4295 1225–7 860137 ] and atypical dichromatic chromatophores, named erythro-iridophores have been described in Pseudochromis diadema.

This process, known as physiological colour change, is most widely studied in melanophores, since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment. In most species with a relatively thin dermis, the dermal melanophores tend to be flat and cover a large surface area. However, in animals with thick dermal layers, such as adult reptiles, dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores. These dermal chromatophore units (DCU) consist of an uppermost xanthophore or erythrophore layer, then an iridophore layer, and finally a basket-like melanophore layer with processes covering the iridophores. [ Bagnara JT, Taylor JD 1968 Hadley ME The dermal chromatophore unit http://www.jcb.org/cgi/reprint/38/1/67 J Cell Biol 38 1 67–79 5691979 2107474 10.1083/jcb.38.1.67 ] Both types of dermal melanophores are important in physiological colour change. Flat dermal melanophores will often overlay other chromatophores so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears dark. When the pigment is aggregated towards the centre of the cell, the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue. Similarly, after melanin aggregation in DCUs, the skin appears green through xanthophore (yellow) filtering of scattered light from the iridophore layer. On the dispersion of melanin, the light is no longer scattered and the skin appears dark. As the other biochromatic chomatophores are also capable of pigment translocation, animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect.

These hormones may also be generated in a paracrine fashion by cells in the skin. At the surface of the melanophore the hormones have been shown to activate specific G-protein coupled receptor s that, in turn, transduce the signal into the cell.

Through a mechanism not yet fully understood, cAMP influences other proteins such as protein kinase A to drive molecular motors carrying pigment containing vesicles along both microtubule s and microfilament s.

This type of camouflage, known as background adaptation, most commonly appears as a slight darkening or lightening of skin tone to approximately mimic the hue of the immediate environment. It has been demonstrated that the background adaptation process is vision dependent (it appears the animal needs to be able to see the environment to adapt to it), and that melanin translocation in melanophores is the major factor in colour change. [ 10.1111/j.1600-0749.2006.00307.x Logan DW, Burn 2006 SF Jackson IJ Regulation of pigmentation in zebrafish melanophores Pigment Cell Res 19 3 206–13 16704454 ] Some animals, such as chameleons and anole s, have a highly developed background adaptation response capable of generating a number of different colours very rapidly. They have adapted the capability to change colour in response to temperature, mood, stress levels and social cues, rather than to simply mimic their environment. [ Development ] { Transverse } { section of a developing vertebrate } { trunk showing the dorsolateral (red) and ventromedial (blue) routes of chromatoblast migration } During vertebrate embryonic development, chromatophores are one of a number of cell types generated in the neural crest, a paired strip of cells arising at the margins of the neural tube. These cells have the ability to migrate long distances, allowing chromatophores to populate many organs of the body, including the skin, eye, ear and brain. Leaving the neural crest in waves, chromatophores take either a dorsolateral route through the dermis, entering the ectoderm through small holes in the basal lamina, or a ventromedial route between the somites and the neural tube. The exception to this is the melanophores of the retinal pigmented epithelium of the eye. These are not derived from the neural crest, instead an outpouching of the neural tube generates the optic cup which, in turn, forms the retina. When and how multipotent chromatophore precursor cells (called chromatoblasts) develop into their daughter subtypes is an area of ongoing research. It is known in zebrafish embryos, for example, that by 3 days after fertilization each of the cell classes found in the adult fish — melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores — are already present. Studies using mutant fish have demonstrated that transcription factor s such as kit, sox10 and mitf are important in controlling chromatophore differentiation.

[ Practical applications ] In addition to basic research into better understanding of chromatophores themselves, the cells are used for applied research purposes. For example, zebrafish larvae are used to study how chromatophores organise and communicate to accurately generate the regular horizontal striped pattern as seen in adult fish. [ Kelsh RN Genetics and evolution of pigment patterns in fish Pigment cell research / sponsored by the European Society for Pigment Cell Research and the International Pigment Cell Society 17 4 326–36 2004 15250934, 10.1111/j.1600-0749.2004.00174.x ] This is seen as a useful model system for understanding patterning in the evolutionary developmental biology field. Chromatophore biology has also been used to model human condition or disease, including melanoma and albinism. Recently the gene responsible for the melanophore-specific golden zebrafish strain, Slc24a5, was shown to have a human equivalent that strongly correlates with skin colour.

Therefore pharmaceutical companies have developed a biological assay for rapidly identifying potential bioactive compounds using melanophores from the African clawed frog.

Nanotubes for noisy signal processing: Adaptive Camouflage PhD Thesis. 2005; } { University of Southern California. } [ Cephalopod chromatophores ] { cuttlefish, using background adaptation to mimic the local environment } Coleoid cephalopods have complex multicellular organs which they use to change colour rapidly. This is most notable in brightly coloured squid, cuttlefish and octopuses. Each chromatophore unit is composed of a single chromatophore cell and numerous muscle, nerve, glial and sheath cells. [ 10.1007/BF00347297 Cloney RA Florey E Ultrastructure of cephalopod chromatophore organs Zeitschrift fur Zellforschung und mikroskopische Anatomie (Vienna, Austria : 1948) 89 2 250–80 1968 5700268, ] Inside the chromatophore cell, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac, called the cytoelastic sacculus. To change colour the animal distorts the sacculus form or size by muscular contraction, changing its translucency, reflectivity or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians and reptiles, in that the shape of the sacculus is being changed rather than a translocation of pigment vesicles within the cell. However a similar effect is achieved. Octopuses can operate chromatophores in complex, wavelike chromatic displays, resulting in a variety of rapidly changing colour schemes. The nerves that operate the chromatophores are thought to be positioned in the brain in a pattern similar to that of the chromatophores they each control. This means the pattern of colour change matches the pattern of neuronal activation. This may explain why, as the neurons are activated one after another, the colour change occurs in waves. [ 10.1159/000113909 Demski LS Chromatophore systems in teleosts and cephalopods: a levels oriented analysis of convergent systems Brain, behavior and evolution 40 2–3 141–56 1992 1422807, ] Like chameleons, cephalopods use physiological colour change for social interaction. They are also among the most skilled at background adaptation, having the ability to match both the colour and the texture of their local environment with remarkable accuracy. [ Bacteria ] Chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototroph ic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. [ Salton MR Bacterial membrane proteins Microbiological sciences 4 4 100–5 1987 3153178, ] In purple bacteria, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum the light-harvesting proteins are intrinsic to the chromatophore membranes. However, in green sulfur bacteria they are arranged in specialised antenna complex es called chlorosome s.
