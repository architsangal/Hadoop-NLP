[ the surname M√§gi M√§gi ] Magi ( Latin plural of magus; [ ŒºŒ¨Œ≥ŒøœÇ ] magos; Old Persian : [ Xpeo êé∂ êé¶ êé¢ êèÅ ] magu≈°, [ ŸÖŸèÿ∫ ] mogh; English singular magian, mage, magus, magusian, magusaean) is a term, used since at least the 4th century BC, to denote followers of Zoroaster, or rather, followers of what the Hellenistic world associated Zoroaster with, which was ‚Äì in the main ‚Äì the ability to read the stars, and manipulate the fate that the stars foretold. The meaning prior to the Hellenistic period is uncertain. Pervasive throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia until late antiquity and beyond, Greek m√°gos, &quot; Magian &quot; or &quot; magician, &quot; was influenced by (and eventually displaced) Greek goƒìs(Œ≥œåŒ∑œÇ), the older word for a practitioner of magic, to include astrology, alchemy and other forms of esoteric knowledge. This association was in turn the product of the Hellenistic fascination for (Pseudo-)Zoroaster, who was perceived by the Greeks to be the &quot; Chaldea n &quot; &quot; founder &quot; of the Magi and &quot; inventor &quot; of both astrology and magic. Among the skeptical thinkers of the period, the term &apos;magian&apos; acquired a negative connotation and was associated with tricksters and conjurers. This pejorative meaning survives in the words &quot; magic &quot; and &quot; magician &quot;. In English, the term &quot; magi &quot; is most commonly used in reference to the Gospel of Matthew &apos;s &quot; wise men from the East &quot;, or &quot; three wise men &quot;, though that number does not actually appear in Matthew&apos;s account. The plural &quot; magi &quot; entered the English language around 1200, in reference to the Biblical magi of [ Matthew 2:1 ]. The singular appears considerably later, in the late 14th century, when it was borrowed from Old French in the meaning magician together with magic. [ Pre-4th century BC usage ] [ In Greek sources ] The perhaps oldest surviving reference to the magi ¬†‚Äì from Greek ŒºŒ¨Œ≥ŒøœÇ (m√°gos, plural: magoi) ‚Äì is from 6th century BC Heraclitus (apud Clemens Protrepticus 12), who curses the magi for their &quot; impious &quot; rites and rituals. A description of the rituals that Heraclitus refers to has not survived, and there is nothing to suggest that Heraclitus was referring to foreigners. Better preserved are the descriptions of the mid-5th century BC Herodotus, who in his portrayal of the Iranian expatriates living in Asia minor uses the term &quot; magi &quot; in two different senses. In the first sense (Histories 1.101), Herodotus speaks of the magi as one of the tribes/peoples (ethnous) of the Medes. In another sense (1.132), Herodotus uses the term &quot; magi &quot; to generically refer to a &quot; sacerdotal caste &quot;, but &quot; whose ethnic origin is never again so much as mentioned. &quot; [ Zaehner Robert Charles 1961 The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism New York MacMillan 163 ] {. } According to Robert Charles Zaehner, in other accounts, &quot; we hear of Magi not only in Persia, Parthia, Bactria, Chorasmia, Aria, Media, and among the Sakas, but also in non-Iranian lands like Samaria, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Their influence was also widespread throughout Asia Minor. It is, therefore, quite likely that the sacerdotal caste of the Magi was distinct from the Median tribe of the same name. &quot; Other Greek sources from before the Hellenistic period include the gentleman-soldier Xenophon, who had first-hand experience at the Persian Achaemenid court. In his early 4th century BC Cyropaedia, the Athenian depicts the magians as authorities for all religious matters (8.3.11), and imagines the magians to be responsible for the education of the emperor-to-be. [ In Persian sources ] Avestan &apos;mag√¢un√¥&apos;, i.e. the religious caste of the Medes which Zoroaster was born into, (see Yasna 33.7:&apos; √Ω√¢ sruy√™ par√™ mag√¢un√¥ &apos; = &apos; so I can be heard beyond Magi &apos;), seems to be the origin of the term. The term only appears twice in Iranian texts from before the 4th century BC, and only one of these can be dated with precision. This one instance occurs in the trilingual Behistun inscription of Darius I, and which can be dated to about 520 BC. In this trilingual text, certain rebels have &apos;magian&apos; as an attribute; in the Old Persian portion as maŒ≥u- (generally assumed to be a loan word from Median ). The meaning of the term in this context is uncertain. The other instance appears in the texts of the Avesta, i.e. in the sacred literature of Zoroastrianism. In this instance, which is in the Younger Avestan portion, the term appears in the hapax moghu.tbi≈°, meaning &quot; hostile to the moghu &quot;, where moghu does not (as was previously thought) mean &quot; magus &quot;, but rather &quot; a member of the tribe &quot; or referred to a particular social class in the proto-Iranian language and then continued to do so in Avestan. [ Gershevitch Ilya Zoroaster&apos;s Own Contribution Journal of Near Eastern Studies 23 1 1964 10.1086/371754 12 ] {, p. 36. } An unrelated term, but previously assumed to be related, appears in the older Gathic Avestan language texts. This word, adjectival magavan meaning &quot; possessing maga- &quot;, was once the premise that Avestan maga- and Median (i.e. Old Persian) magu- were co-eval (and also that both these were cognates of Vedic Sanskrit magha-). While &quot; in the Gathas the word seems to mean both the teaching of Zoroaster and the community that accepted that teaching, &quot; and it seems that Avestan maga- is related to Sanskrit magha-, &quot; there is no reason to suppose that the western Iranian form magu (Magus) has exactly the same meaning &quot; as well. But it &quot; may be, however, &quot; that Avestan moghu (which is not the same as Avestan maga-) &quot; and Medean magu were the same word in origin, a common Iranian term for &apos;member of the tribe&apos; having developed among the Medes the special sense of &apos;member of the (priestly) tribe&apos;, hence a priest. &quot; [ Boyce Mary Mary Boyce A History of Zoroastrianism, Vol. I 1975 Brill Leiden 10‚Äì11 ] cf [ 4th century BC onwards ] [ In Graeco-Roman sources ] { Basilica of Sant&apos;Apollinare Nuovo. } As early as the 5th century BC, Greek magos had spawned mageia and magike to describe the activity of a magus, that is, it was his or her art and practice. But almost from the outset the noun for the action and the noun for the actor parted company. Thereafter, mageia was used not for what actual magi did, but for something related to the word &apos;magic&apos; in the modern sense, i.e. using supernatural means to achieve an effect in the natural world, or the appearance of achieving these effects through trickery or sleight of hand. The early Greek texts typically have the pejorative meaning, which in turn influenced the meaning of magos to denote a conjurer and a charlatan. Already in the mid-5th century BC, Herodotus identifies the magi as interpreters of omens and dreams (Histories 7.19, 7.37, 1.107, 1.108, 1.120, 1.128). Once the magi had been associated with &quot; magic &quot; ‚ÄîGreek magikos‚Äîit was but a natural progression that the Greek&apos;s image of Zoroaster would metamorphose into a magician too. [ Beck Roger Zoroaster, as perceived by the Greeks Encyclopaedia Iranica New York iranica.com 2003 http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/sup/Zoroaster_Greeks.html ] {. } The first century Pliny the elder names &quot; Zoroaster &quot; as the inventor of magic ( Natural History xxx.2.3), but a &quot; principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds. That dubious honor went to another fabulous magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed. &quot; For Pliny, this magic was a &quot; monstrous craft &quot; that gave the Greeks not only a &quot; lust &quot; (aviditatem) for magic, but a downright &quot; madness &quot; (rabiem) for it, and Pliny supposed that Greek philosophers‚Äîamong them Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato ‚Äîtraveled abroad to study it, and then returned to teach it (xxx.2.8-10). &quot; Zoroaster &quot; ‚Äì or rather what the Greeks supposed him to be ‚Äì was for the Hellenists the figurehead of the &apos;magi&apos;, and the founder of that order (or what the Greeks considered to be an order). He was further projected as the author of a vast compendium of &quot; Zoroastrian &quot; pseudepigrapha, composed in the main to discredit the texts of rivals. &quot; The Greeks considered the best wisdom to be exotic wisdom &quot; and &quot; what better and more convenient authority than the distant ‚Äî temporally and geographically ‚Äî Zoroaster? &quot; The subject of these texts, the authenticity of which was rarely challenged, ranged from treatises on nature to ones on necromancy. But the bulk of these texts dealt with astronomical speculations and magical lore. One factor for the association with astrology was Zoroaster&apos;s name, or rather, what the Greeks made of it. Within the scheme of Greek thinking (which was always on the lookout for hidden significances and &quot; real &quot; meanings of words) his name was identified at first with star-worshiping (astrothytes &quot; star sacrificer &quot; ) and, with the Zo-, even as the living star. Later, an even more elaborate mytho-etymology evolved: Zoroaster died by the living (zo-) flux (-ro-) of fire from the star (-astr-) which he himself had invoked, and even, that the stars killed him in revenge for having been restrained by him. The second, and &quot; more serious &quot; [ Beck Roger Thus Spake Not Zarathushtra: Zoroastrian Pseudepigrapha of the Graeco-Roman World 491‚Äì565 A History of Zoroastrianism 3 Boyce Mary Grenet Frantz Handbuch der Orientalistik, Abteilung I, Band VIII, Abschnitt 1 Leiden Brill 1991 ] {, p. 516. } factor for the association with astrology was the notion that Zoroaster was a Chaldea n. The alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos (cf. Agathias 2.23-5, Clement Stromata I.15), which‚Äîso Bidez and Cumont‚Äîderived from a Semitic form of his name. The Pythagorean tradition considered the &quot; founder &quot; of their order to have studied with Zoroaster in Chaldea ( Porphyry Life of Pythagoras 12, Alexander Polyhistor apud Clement&apos;s Stromata I.15, Diodorus of Eritrea, Aristoxenus apud Hippolitus VI32.2). Lydus (On the Months II.4) attributes the creation of the seven-day week to &quot; the Chaldeans in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes, &quot; and who did so because there were seven planets. The Suda &apos;s chapter on astronomia notes that the Babylonians learned their astrology from Zoroaster. Lucian of Samosata (Mennipus 6) decides to journey to Babylon &quot; to ask one of the magi, Zoroaster&apos;s disciples and successors, &quot; for their opinion.

Mair provides archaeological and linguistic evidence suggesting that Chinese &apos;&apos;w≈´&apos;&apos; (Â∑´ &quot; shaman; witch, wizard; magician &quot;, Old Chinese *m y ag) was a loanword from Old Persian *magu≈° &quot; magician; magi &quot;. [ Mair Victor H. 1990 Old Sinitic *Myag, Old Persian Magu≈°and English Magician Early China 15 27‚Äì47 ] {. } He describes: The recent discovery at an early Chou site of two figurines with unmistakably Caucasoid or Europoid feature is startling prima facie evidence of East-West interaction during the first half of the first millennium Before the Current Era. It is especially interesting that one of the figurines bears on the top of his head the clearly incised graph ‚ò© which identifies him as a wu ( &lt; *m y ag). These figurines, which are dated circa 8th century BC, were discovered during a 1980 excavation of a Zhou Dynasty palace in Fufeng County ( Shaanxi Province). Mair connects the ancient Bronzeware script for wu Â∑´ &quot; shaman &quot; (a cross with potent s ) with a Western heraldic symbol of magicians, the cross potent ‚ò©, which &quot; can hardly be attributable to sheer coincidence or chance independent origination. &quot; Compared with the linguistic reconstruction s of many Indo-European languages, the current reconstruction of Old (or &quot; Archaic &quot; ) Chinese is more provisional. This velar final -g in Mair&apos;s *m y ag (Â∑´) is evident in several Old Chinese reconstructions (Dong Tonghe&apos;s *m y wag, Zhou Fagao&apos;s *mjwaŒ≥, and Li Fanggui &apos;s *mjag), but not all ( Bernhard Karlgren &apos;s *m y wo and Axel Schuessler&apos;s *ma). [ In Semitic sources ] In Arabic texts of the Islamic period, Zoroaster is ‚Äì as in Greco-Roman tradition also ‚Äì &quot; founder &quot; of the magians, Arabic majus ya. The Koranic word ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨Ÿàÿ≥ (Koran 22:17) refers to the Zoroastrians. In the 1980s, majus was part of Iraqi propaganda vocabulary of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War to refer to Iranians in general. &quot; By referring to the Iranians in these documents as majus, the security apparatus [implied] that the Iranians [were] not sincere Muslims, but rather covertly practice their pre-Islamic beliefs. Thus, in their eyes, Iraq&apos;s war took on the dimensions of not only a struggle for Arab nationalism, but also a campaign in the name of Islam. &quot; [ The Mindset of Iraq&apos;s Security Apparatus Al-Marashi, Ibrahim 2000 5 http://www.cambridgesecurity.net/pdf/iraqi-mindset.pdf Cambridge University: Centre of International Studies ] [ In Christian tradition ] { Biblical &apos;&apos;&apos;magi&apos;&apos;&apos; (&apos;&apos;Adora√ß√£o dos Magos&apos;&apos; by Vicente Gil).

However, early church fathers, such as St. Justin, Origen, St. Augustine and St. Jerome, did not make an exception for the Gospel, and translated the word in its ordinary sense, i.e. as &quot; magician &quot;. [ Drum W. 1910 Magi The Catholic Encyclopedia New York Robert Appleton Company http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09527a.htm ] The Gospel of Matthew states that magi visited the infant Jesus shortly after his birth ( [ Matthew 2:1-2:12 9 ] ). The gospel describes how magi from the east were notified of the birth of a king in Judaea by the appearance of his star. Upon their arrival in Jerusalem, they visited King Herod to determine the location of where the king of the Jews had been born. Herod, disturbed, told them that he had not heard of the child, but informed them of a prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. He then asked the magians to inform him when they find the infant so that Herod may also worship him. Guided by the Star of Bethlehem, the wise men found the baby Jesus in a house (The Gospels do not say if the Magi found him in Bethlehem. It only says that they saw the star and found the child in a house), worshiped him, and presented him with &quot; gifts of gold and of frankincense and of myrrh. &quot; (2.11) In a dream they are warned not to return to Herod, and therefore return to their homes by taking another route. Since its composition in the late 1st century, numerous apocryphal stories have embellished the gospel&apos;s account. In addition to the more famous story of Simon Magus found in chapter 8, the Book of Acts ( [ Acts 13:6-11 ] ) also describes another magus who acted as an advisor of Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul at Paphos on the island of Cyprus. He was a Jew named Bar-Jesus (son of Jesus), or alternatively Elymas. (Another Cypriot magus named Atomos is referenced by Josephus, working at the court of Felix at Caesarea.) [ Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn ] The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn used the title of &quot; Magus &quot; to refer to the second-highest level of attainment in their degree system. This system, with associated titles, would later be adopted by Aleister Crowley for his occult order A‚à¥A‚à¥, wherein the title &quot; Magus &quot; also designated the second-highest attainable grade of magic ( Moses, Buddha, and Lao Tzu being some examples of those who attained this grade). To be a Magi means to journey to give gifts. [ See also ] Anachitis - &quot; stone of necessity &quot; - stone used to call up spirits from water, used by Magi in antiquity.
