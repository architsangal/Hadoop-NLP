It is the county seat of Traill County. [ 6 ] The population was 1,603 at the 2010 census. Hillsboro was founded in 1881. Hillsboro sits in the fertile Red River Valley. Local agriculture has dominated the area&apos;s economy from the beginning. With its location on Interstate 29, halfway between the two metropolitan centers of Greater Grand Forks and Fargo-Moorhead, Hillsboro has seen steady population growth in recent years and has become somewhat of a bedroom community. Hillsboro is known for having the oldest weekly newspaper in the state, the Hillsboro Banner. [ History ] [ October 2010 ] The area along the Goose River that is now Hillsboro was first settled by German and Norwegian settlers around 1870. In 1880, the present day site of Hillsboro was founded under the name &quot; Comstock &quot;. Local folklore tells of the residents of nearby Caledonia, North Dakota turning away a shabby surveyor because of his appearance. This man was then offered hospitality by residents in the tiny settlement of Comstock. The man turned out to be railroad baron James J. Hill. Hill was so impressed by the kindness showed to him by the residents of this small community that he decided to place his Great Northern Railway there instead of in Caledonia. The name of Comstock was changed to &quot; Hill City &quot; in September 1880 in honor of Mr. Hill. The city was then renamed &quot; Hillsboro &quot; in 1881 after it was discovered that there was already a &quot; Hill City &quot; in South Dakota. In 2006, Hillsboro celebrated its 125th birthday.

[ Economy ] [ October 2010 ] The economy of Hillsboro, like so many other small, rural towns in North Dakota, is heavily dependent on agriculture. When local farmers have a bad harvest, the Hillsboro economy can also suffer. In turn, when the harvest is good, Hillsboro usually prospers. One of the more obvious effects the agricultural community has had on Hillsboro is found at the American Crystal Sugar sugar beet plant directly north of town. The large plant, located on U.S. Highway 81, has been responsible for both an increase in population and a steady stream of available jobs during the last few decades that it has been open. In recent years, Hillsboro has become a bedroom community for the Greater Grand Forks and Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan areas. This has led to an increase in both population and home construction. However, the local business community has, for the most part, not reaped the benefits of the growth. Many Hillsboro residents pass up Hillsboro stores and restaurants in favor of the better selections available in the Grand Forks and Fargo areas. The once bustling downtown area (centered at the intersection of Caledonia Avenue and Main Street) has become filled with empty storefronts. [ Education ] [ October 2010 ] The Hillsboro Public Schools system provides residents with an elementary school and a high school. Hillsboro High School&apos;s athletic teams are known as The Burros, which makes their mascot the donkey. The high school does not offer Advanced Placement classes, but has a dual credit program through Lake Region State College. These classes are worth college credit at most in-state colleges and universities. In 2003, 40% of students met or exceeded grade-level standards in Math, and 76% of students met or exceeded grade-level standards in English, above-average when compared to the state average of 39% and 61%, respectively.

Woodland City Park sits on the banks of the Goose River. It offers a public swimming pool and scenic views of a dam on the river. For many years, there has also been a group of deer living in a penned in area of the park. The Goose River Golf Club sits directly north of town. [ Media ] The local paper is the weekly Hillsboro Banner. The Banner has been published continuously since 1879, making it the oldest weekly newspaper in the state of North Dakota. Hillsboro has no radio stations of its own. Nearby stations include KMAV 105.5 FM and KMSR 1520 AM in nearby Mayville and KRJB 106.3 FM in Ada, Minnesota. Residents have access to radio stations and network affiliates from both Grand Forks and Fargo.

The Interstate runs on the western edge of the community and there is an interchange (Caledonia Avenue) that connects the Interstate to Hillsboro. U.S. Highway 81 runs through the community and also connects Hillsboro to Grand Forks and Fargo. Like so many towns in the American Midwest, Hillsboro&apos;s streets are aligned in the grid pattern. In Hillsboro, routes that run north to south are called streets and routes that run east to west are called avenues. The BNSF Railway, eventual successor to the Great Northern, continues to maintain tracks in Hillsboro that see a variety of freight trains every day as well as Amtrak &apos;s Empire Builder, which passes through without stopping in the early morning hours. The Hillsboro Municipal Airport is a small airport south of town with a landing strip which provides an area for crop dusters or small private airplanes to stop. However, residents have to travel either to Grand Forks or Fargo in order to take regularly scheduled flights to major airports. [ Notable people ] Elmore Y.
