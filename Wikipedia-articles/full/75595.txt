The dialect serving as the basis for the main literary and standard language is Shtokavian, which is also the basis of standard Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. { Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Or Montenegrin? Or Just &apos;Our Language&apos;?, } { Radio Free Europe, February 21, 2009 } In particular, Serbian is standardized around Šumadija-Vojvodina and Eastern Herzegovinian subdialects of Shtokavian. The Torlakian dialect of Serbian is spoken in southeast Serbia, and is not standardized, as it represents transitional form to Macedonian and Bulgarian. Serbo-Croatian is the only European language with active digraphia, using both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The Bosnian and Serbian varieties use both alphabets while the Croatian variety uses only the Latin alphabet. { http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/serbian-language } [ March 2012 ] The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was devised in 1814 by Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić, who created the alphabet on phonemic principles. The Latin alphabet was designed by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in 1830. [ History ] [ Middle Ages ] Prince Rastko Nemanjić (1174–1235), the youngest son of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja, later left royal life and took monastic vows under the name Sava. During Sava&apos;s time as monk in Mount Athos, he wrote the Karyes Typicon, which was implicitly the first codification of the Serbian language. The second reform was during the rule of Despot Stefan Lazarević, of which Serbian ortography was known as Resava school. [ Modern ] Before 1400, most Serbian vernaculars had two accents, both with fall intonation—the short one and the long one. That is why they are called &quot; old accents &quot;. By 1500, the old accents moved by one syllable towards the beginning of the word, changing their quality to rising accents. For instance, junâk (hero) became jùnāk. The old accents logically remained only when they were on first syllable. Not all dialects had this evolution; those who had it are called neo- shtokavian. The dispersal center was in eastern Herzegovina. Since the 16th century people had been emigrating from this area. The biggest migrations were to the north, then toward Military Krajina and to the seaside ( Dalmatia, Istria, Dubrovnik area, including the islands of Mljet and Šipan ). In the 1920s and 1930s the royal government tried to settle people from this poor mountainous area to the Kosovo basin. Vojvodina was settled with inhabitants from this area after WWII. When all old accents had moved to the beginning of the word by one syllable, this was the result: In words with two or more syllables the last syllable cannot be stressed One-syllable words can have only falling accents In polysyllabic words, if an inner syllable is stressed, then it can have only a rising accent (there are exceptions—in standard and in many vernaculars, for instance when there is a ` – – combination) In a word with two or more syllables, if the first syllable is stressed, then it can have any of the four accents. [ Classification ] Serbian is a form of Serbo-Croatian, a Slavic language ( Indo-European ), of the South Slavic subgroup. Serbo-Croatian consists of Serbian along with Bosnian, Croatian, and Montenegrin. It has lower intelligibility with the East South Slavic languages Bulgarian and Macedonian, than with Slovene (although Slovene is part of the West subgroup, it is hindered by differences in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation to the Serbo-Croatian standard forms, although closer to the Serbo-Croatian Kajkavian and Čakavian dialect s { Greenberg, Marc L., A Short Reference Grammar of Slovene, (LINCOM Studies in Slavic Linguistics 30). Munich: LINCOM, 2008. ISBN 3-89586-965-1 } ). The South Slavic languages all derive their forms from Old Church Slavonic, with Serbian emerging from Old Serbian (Serbian-Slavonic), which has a literary history from the 10th century.

Serbian was the official language of Montenegro until 2007 when the new Constitution of Montenegro replaced the Constitution of 1992. Amid opposition from pro-Serbian parties, { &apos;&apos;Pro-Serbian parties oppose Montenegro constitution&apos;&apos; } Montenegrin language was made the sole official language of the country and Serbian was given the status of a recognised minority language along with Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian. { Ustav Crne Gore } As per 2003 census results, 63.49% of the population declared their native language as Serbian, compared to 21.96% who declared as Montenegrin, the latter being mainly concentrated in Old Montenegro. The 2011 census results show that 42.88% still declare Serbian to be their native language, while Montenegrin is declared by 36.97% of the population. [ Writing system ] Standard Serbian language uses both Cyrillic ( [ sh-Cryl ћирилица ] / [ sh-Latn ćirilica ] ) and Latin script ( [ sh-Latn latinica ] / [ sh-Cyrl латиница ] ). Although Serbian language authorities have recognized the official status for both scripts in contemporary standard Serbian language for more than half of a century now, due to historical reasons, Cyrillic was made the official script of Serbia&apos;s administration by the 2006 Constitution. [ The Constitution The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Serbia http://www.ustavni.sud.rs/page/view/en-GB/235-100028/constitution 2010-12-06 ] However, the law does not regulate scripts in standard language, or standard language itself by any means, leaving the choice of script as a matter of personal preference and to the free will in all aspects of life (publishing, media, trade and commerce, etc.), except in government paperwork production and in official written communication with state officials which have to be in Cyrillic. Even in official government documents this constitutional requirement is rarely enforced. Serbian is a rare and excellent example of synchronic digraphia, a situation where all literate members of a society have two interchangeable writing systems available to them. An example of diagraphia is the media in Serbia. The public broadcaster, Radio Television of Serbia, predominantly uses the Cyrillic script while the privately run broadcasters, like RTV Pink, predominantly uses the Latin script.

These are the tenses of the indicative mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the imperative mood. The conditional mood has two more tenses, the first conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses), and the second conditional (without use in spoken language—it should be used for impossible conditional clauses). Serbian has active and passive voice. As for the non-finite verb forms, Serbian has one infinitive, two adjectival participle s (the active and the passive), and two adverbial participle s (the present and the past). [ Vocabulary ] Most of the words in Serbian are of Slavic origin, meaning that their roots can often be traced back to a reconstructed Proto-Slavic language. For instance, srce ( &quot; heart &quot; ), plav ( &quot; blue &quot; ). There are many loanword s from different languages: [ Turcizmi u srpsko-hrvatskom jeziku Škaljić Abdulah &quot; Svjetlost &quot; Sarajevo 1966 http://www.scribd.com/doc/40162381/Abdulah-Skaljic-Turcizmi-u-Srpsko-Hrvatskom-Jeziku 25 ] [ grc αὐλή ] The number of Turkish loanwords is also significant. Linguist Abdulah Škaljić found around 7,000 Turkish words in Serbo-Croatian, however many fell out of use. Some of these words are not Turkish in origin but Arabic or Persian; they entered Serbian via Turkish. However, these words are disappearing from the standard language at a faster rate than loanwords from any other language. In Belgrade, for instance, čakšire (чакшире) was the only word for trousers before World War II, today pantalone (панталоне; a borrowing from Italian) is current; some 30–50 years ago avlija (авлија &lt; Turkish avlı Ottoman Turkish lexeme itself was in turn borrowed from the Greek ) was a common word for courtyard or backyard in Belgrade, today it is the native Slavic dvorište (двориште); only 15 years ago čaršav (чаршав) was usual for tablecloth, today it is stolnjak (столњак). The greatest number of Turkish loanwords were and are in the vernaculars of south Serbia, followed by those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and central Serbia, generally corresponding with how many Muslims live in an area. Many Turkish loanwords are usual in the vernaculars of Vojvodina as well. There are plenty of loanwords from German. The great number of them are specific for vernaculars which were situated in the Austrian monarchy ( Vojvodina ). Most cultural words attested before World War II, were borrowed from (or via) German, even when they are of French or English origin (šorc, boks). The accent is an excellent indicator for that, since German loanwords in Serbian have rising accents. Italian words in standard language were often borrowed via German (makarone). If they were not taken directly from Italian, they show specific, not regular, adaptations. For instance špagète for Italian spaghetti rather than the &quot; expected &quot; špàgete. The most common informal Serbian greeting is &quot; Ćao &quot;, after the Italian &quot; Ciao &quot;. Greek loanwords were very common in Old Serbian (Serbian-Slavonic). Some words are present and common in the modern vernaculars of central Serbia (as well as other areas) and in the standard language: hiljada (хиљада), tiganj (тигањ), patos (патос), jeftin (јефтин). Almost every word of the Serbian Orthodox ceremonies is of Greek origin (parastos (парастос) &apos;requiem&apos;). Vasmer, Max. Griechische Lehnwörter im Serboischen. 1943. The number of Hungarian loanwords in the standard language is small: bitanga (битанга), alas (алас), ašov (ашов)). However, they are present in some vernaculars of Vojvodina and also in historical documents, local literature. Some place names in northern central Serbia as Barajevo, are probably of Hungarian origin. Hadrovics, László. Ungarische Elemente im Serbischen. Köln / Wien. 1985 Classical international words (words mainly with Latin or Greek roots) are adapted in Serbian like in most European languages, not translated as in Croatian. For instance Serbian atmosfera, Croatian ozracje, S telegraf, C brzojav, S avion, C zrakoplov.

Duden Universalwörterbuch, s.v. Schliwowitz Paprika and slivovitz are borrowed via German; paprika itself entered German via Hungarian. Vampire entered most West European languages through German-language texts in the early 18th century and has since spread widely in the world. [ Serbian literature ] [ Serbian literature ] { Miroslavljevo jevanđelje &apos;&apos; (The Gospel of Miroslav), a } { manuscript, ca. 1186 } Serbian literature emerged in the Middle Ages, and included such works as Miroslavljevo jevanđelje ( Miroslav&apos;s Gospel ) in 1192 and Dušanov zakonik ( Dušan&apos;s Code ) in 1349. Little secular medieval literature has been preserved, but what there is shows that it was in accord with its time; for example, Serbian Alexandride, a book about Alexander the Great, and a translation of Tristan and Iseult into Serbian. Although not belonging to the literature proper, the corpus of Serbian literacy in the 14th and 15th centuries contains numerous legal, commercial and administrative texts with marked presence of Serbian vernacular juxtaposed on the matrix of Serbian Church Slavonic. In the mid-15th century, Serbia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and for the next 400 years there was no opportunity for the creation of secular written literature. However, some of the greatest literary works in Serbian come from this time, in the form of oral literature, the most notable form being Serbian epic poetry. The epic poems were mainly written down in the 19th century, and preserved in oral tradition up to the 1950s, a few centuries or even a millennium longer than by most other &quot; epic folks &quot;. Goethe and Jacob Grimm learned Serbian in order to read Serbian epic poetry in the original. By the end of the 18th century, the written literature had become estranged from the spoken language. In the second half of the 18th century, the new language appeared, called Slavonic-Serbian. This artificial idiom superseded the works of poets and historians like Gavrilo Stefanović Venclović, who wrote in essentially modern Serbian in the 1720s. These vernacular compositions have remained cloistered from the general public and received due attention only with the advent of modern literary historians and writers like Milorad Pavić. In the early 19th century, Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, promoted the spoken language of the people as a literary norm. [ Dictionaries ] [ June 2008 ] Serious Serbian and Croatian dictionaries regularly include Croatian only, and Serbian only words. [ Standard dictionaries ] Rečnik srpskohrvatskog književnog i narodnog jezika (Dictionary of Serbo-Croatian standard language and vernaculars) is the biggest dictionary of Serbian and still unfinished. Starting with 1959, 16 volumes were published, about 40 are expected. Works of Croatian authors are excerpted, if published before 1991. Rečnik srpskohrvatskoga književnog jezika in 6 volumes, started as a common project of Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska, but only the first three volumes were also published in Croato-Serbian (hrvatskosrpski). Rečnik srpskoga jezika (ISBN 978-86-7946-004-2) in one volume, published in 2007 by Matica srpska, which on more than 1500 pages in A4 format explains more than 85.000 entries. Several volume dictionaries were published in Croatia (for the Croatian language) since the 1990s (Anić, Enciklopedijski rječnik, Hrvatski rječnik). [ Bilingual dictionaries ] [ December 2011 ] Standard dictionaries Specialized dictionaries Phraseological dictionaries [ Historical dictionaries ] The Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika (I-XXIII), published by the Yugoslav academy of sciencies and arts ( Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts ) from 1880 to 1976, is the only general historical dictionary of Croatian and Serbian language. Its first editor was Đuro Daničić, followed by Pero Budmani and the famous Vukovian Tomislav Maretić. The sources of this dictionary are, especially in the first volumes, mainly Štokavian. [ Etymological dictionaries ] The standard and the only completed etymological dictionary of Serbian is the &quot; Skok &quot;, written by the Croatian linguist Petar Skok : Etimologijski rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika ( &quot; Etymological Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian &quot; ). I-IV. Zagreb 1971–1974. There is also a new monumental Etimološki rečnik srpskog jezika (Etymological Dictionary of Serbian). So far, two volumes have been published: I (with words on A-), and II (Ba-Bd). There are specialized etymological dictionaries for German, Italian, Croatian, Turkish, Greek, Hungarian, Russian, English and other loanwords (cf. chapter word origin).
