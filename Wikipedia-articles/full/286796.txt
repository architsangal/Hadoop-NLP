Benzophenone is a widely used building block in organic chemistry, being the parent diarylketone. [ Uses ] Benzophenone can be used as a photo initiator in UV-curing applications such as inks, imaging, and clear coatings in the printing industry. Benzophenone prevents ultraviolet ( UV ) light from damaging scents and colors in products such as perfumes and soaps. It can also be added to the plastic packaging as a UV blocker. Its use allows manufacturers to package the product in clear glass or plastic. Without it, opaque or dark packaging would be required. In biological applications, benzophenones have been used extensively as photophysical probes to identify and map peptide–protein interactions [ Dorman Gyorgy Prestwich, Glenn D. Benzophenone Photophores in Biochemistry Biochemistry 1 May 1994 33 19 5661–5673 10.1021/bi00185a001 ]. [ Synthesis ] Benzophenone can be prepared by the reaction of benzene with carbon tetrachloride followed by hydrolysis of the resulting diphenyldichloromethane, [ Marvel, C. S.; Sperry, W. M. Benzophenone cv1p0095 1 95 1941 ] or by Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with benzoyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminium chloride ) catalyst. The industrial synthesis relies on the copper-catalyzed oxidation of diphenylmethane with air. { Hardo Siegel, Manfred Eggersdorfer &quot; Ketones &quot; in Ullmann&apos;s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, 2002 by Wiley-VCH, Wienheim. DOI: 10.1002/14356007.a15_077 } [ Organic chemistry ] Benzophenone is a common photosensitizer in photochemistry. It crosses from the S 1 state into the triplet state with nearly 100% yield. The resulting diradical will abstract a hydrogen atom from a suitable hydrogen donor to form a ketyl radical. [ Benzophenone radical anion ] [ Air-free technique ] Sodium reduces benzophenone to the deeply colored radical anion, diphenylketyl: Na + Ph 2 CO → Na + Ph 2 CO &amp; middot;− This ketyl is used in the purification of organic solvents, particularly ethers, because it reacts with water and oxygen to give non-volatile products. Very dry solvents are obtained by refluxing over benzophenone and sodium metal prior to distillation. [ W. L. F. Armarego and C. Chai Purification of laboratory chemicals 2003 Butterworth-Heinemann Oxford 0-7506-7571-3 ] [ L. M. Harwood, C. J. Moody and J. M. Percy Experimental Organic Chemistry: Standard and Microscale 1999 Blackwell Science Oxford 978-0-632-04819-9 ] The ketyl is soluble in the organic solvent being dried, so it reacts quickly with residual water and oxygen. In comparison, sodium is insoluble, and its heterogeneous reaction is much slower. The ketyl radical generally appears blue or purple, depending on the solvent. [ Commercially significant derivatives ] Substituted benzophenones such as oxybenzone and dioxybenzone are used in some sunscreen s. The use of benzophenone-derivatives which structurally resemble a strong photosensitizer has been strongly criticized (see sunscreen controversy ). [ Knowland, John; McKenzie, Edward A.; McHugh, Peter J.; Cridland, Nigel A. Sunlight-induced mutagenicity of a common sunscreen ingredient FEBS Letters 324 3 309–313 1993 8405372 10.1016/0014-5793(93)80141-G ] p,p&apos;-bis(N,N-dimethylamino)benzophenone or Michler&apos;s ketone has dimethylamino substituent s at each para position. The high-strength polymers PEEK, polyetherether ketones, are prepared from derivatives of benzophenone. [ See also ] Sunscreen [ References ] [ Notes ] Merck Index, 11th edition, 1108.

The mixture is still not blue yet indicating that the reaction is not complete. The intense blue coloration due to the benzophenone ketyl radical shows that the toluene is considered free of air and moisture. After the toluene has been thoroughly dried by the sodium and benzophenone, it is distilled at atmospheric pressure under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen to prevent contamination by air into the receiving Schlenk flask. A solvent pot contains dibutyl ether dried over sodium and benzophenone, which gives it its purple color.
