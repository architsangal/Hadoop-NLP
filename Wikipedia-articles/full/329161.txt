It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Mina and follows the Southern Tier Expressway and Quickway east through Corning and Binghamton to Woodbury, where it turns south to follow the Orange Turnpike to the New Jersey state line near Suffern, where it connects to that state&apos;s Route  17. From the Pennsylvania border to the city of Elmira and from Binghamton to Windsor, NY  17 is concurrent with Interstate  86 (I-86). Eventually, the entire east –west portion of NY  17 from the Pennsylvania border to Woodbury will become I-86 as projects to upgrade the route to Interstate Highway standards are completed. At 397  miles, NY  17 is the longest state route in New York. It serves 11 counties ( Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, Allegany, Steuben, Chemung, Tioga, Broome, Delaware, Sullivan, Orange, and Rockland ), passes through the cities of Salamanca, Olean, Corning, Elmira, and Binghamton, and enters the vicinity of several others, including Jamestown and Middletown. As it proceeds across the state, it intersects many of New York&apos;s Interstate and U.S. Highway s, including U.S. Route  219 (US  219) in Salamanca, US  15 (future I-99 ) near Corning, I-81 in Binghamton, and I-84 near Middletown. The portion of NY  17 in the vicinity of Waverly is actually located in Pennsylvania; however, it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. The route was assigned in 1924, extending from Westfield to Suffern via at-grade highways. It was moved onto the Quickway and the Southern Tier Expressway as sections of both were completed from the 1950s to the 1980s. Two of NY  17&apos;s suffixed routes, NY  17C and NY  17M, follow substantial portions of NY  17&apos;s pre-freeway alignment. In 1998, all of NY  17 between the Pennsylvania state line and Harriman was designated as &quot; Future I-86 &quot;. The westernmost [ 177 mi 0 ] of the route was designated as I-86 one year later, and the designation has been gradually extended eastward as sections of NY  17 are improved to Interstate Highway standards. [ Route description ] [ Pennsylvania to Elmira ] [ Interstate 86 (east) ] NY  17 begins at the point where Interstate  86 (I-86) crosses the New York–Pennsylvania border in Mina, Chautauqua County. I-86 and NY  17 continue eastward through the Southern Tier, encountering NY  426 (exit  4) a short distance from the state line prior to meeting NY  76 (exit  6) south of Sherman. East of exit  8 ( NY  394 ), I-86 and NY  17 cross Chautauqua Lake and follow the lake shore eastward to Jamestown, where it connects to NY  60 at exit  12 due north of the city. East of the city, the expressway meets U.S. Route  62 (US  62) at exit  14 and is joined by the old Erie Railroad line, which parallels the expressway as it heads across southern New York. Between exits  17 and  18 ( NY  280 ), I-86 and NY  17 cross the Allegheny Reservoir near its northernmost extent. Past NY  280, the freeway runs adjacent to the northern extent of the Allegany State Park and follows the reservoir and the connecting Allegheny River eastward to Salamanca. Near downtown Salamanca, I-86 and NY  17 meet US  219 (exit  21). US  219 joins the expressway east to exit  23 near Carrollton, where it splits from I-86 and NY  17 and heads toward Bradford, Pennsylvania, forming the eastern edge of the state park as it heads south. Meanwhile, the expressway continues east to Olean, where it meets NY  417 (a previous alignment of NY  17) at exit  24 west of town and NY  16 (exit  27) north of the area. Past Olean, the route drifts northward away from Pennsylvania toward Hornell, where I-86 and NY  17 intersect NY  36 (exit  34). To the east in Avoca, the Southern Tier Expressway meets I-390 at exit  36. I-86 and NY  17 southeast from the junction, passing through Bath on its way an interchange with US  15 in Painted Post (exit  44). Here, US  15 begins and heads south toward Pennsylvania while I-86 and NY  17 continue east through Corning to the city of Elmira. At exit  56 ( NY  352 ), I-86 temporarily terminates as NY  17 continues eastward toward Binghamton. [ Elmira to Harriman ] Sign along eastbound NY  17 marking return to New York after its brief foray into Pennsylvania. From Elmira to Binghamton, NY  17, the Erie Railroad (now operated by Norfolk Southern as the Southern Tier Line ), and its old alignments generally stay close together. They follow the Chemung River to exit  60 ( US  220 in South Waverly, Pennsylvania ) and the Susquehanna River from east of exit  61 ( Waverly, New York ) to Binghamton; on the latter section, both NY  17C and NY  434 are old NY  17. Between the two rivers, which intersect in Pennsylvania, the general corridor runs just north of the state line in New York. However, NY  17 itself crosses into Pennsylvania between a point west of exit  60 and a point west of exit  61; additionally, all the ramps at exit  60 and portions of the eastbound ramps at exits  59A and  61 are in Pennsylvania. Despite being in Pennsylvania, these roadways are maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.

Heading eastbound, the freeway curves sharply left around the hillside, splits into ramps to I-81 north and south, and curves right to merge into I-81 south as it passes over the Chenango River. From that point east and southeast about 5 miles (8  km), I-81 and NY  17 run concurrently. NY  17 splits from I-81, the Erie Railroad and the Susquehanna River to the east into Stilson Hollow; from this split (exit  75) to its end, most of NY  17 does not follow the Erie Railroad, which crosses into Pennsylvania several times. NY  17 merges here with I-81 for 5 miles before splitting in Binghamton. At the end of Stilson Hollow, NY  17 heads over a summit and into the valley formed by the Occanum Creek. The creek empties into the Susquehanna River at Windsor (exit  79), which NY  17 follows southeast to Damascus (exit  80) before turning northeast along Tuscarora Creek. It soon turns east and southeast over a summit, rejoining the Erie Railroad just north of Gulf Summit. The highway and railroad head east along Oquaga Creek to Deposit (exit  84), where they turn southeast along the West Branch Delaware River. A gap in the freeway stretches from here to just short of Hancock (exit  87), the place the West Branch joins with the East Branch Delaware River. The Erie Railroad continues southeast along the combined Delaware River, while NY  17 turns east along the valley formed by the East Branch, either closely following or built directly over the abandoned New York, Ontario and Western Railway { http://home.comcast.net/~oandw/relics4.htm } [ December 2010 ] to Liberty. At East Branch (exit  90), the East Branch Delaware River turns north, and NY  17 continues east with the Beaver Kill to Roscoe (exit  94), Willowemoc Creek to Livingston Manor (exit  96), and Little Beaver Kill to Parksville. Construction of a bypass around Parksville was completed in 2012, eliminating an at-grade intersection(Exit 98) and a traffic signal. The highway and parallel NYO &amp; W pass south over a summit to Liberty (exits  99–100), and continue along the Middle Mongaup River to Ferndale (exit  101). The NYO &amp; W turned east there, but NY  17 continues south over a summit and into the Spring Brook and East Mongaup River valleys past Harris (exit  102). NY  17 then cuts southeast cross-country to Monticello (exit  104; passing Monticello Raceway ) and beyond, following the old Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (old NY  17) to Bloomingburg (exit  116). The old Middletown and Wurtsboro Turnpike, also old NY  17, and partially NY  17M, runs south to Middletown, which NY  17 cuts cross-country to bypass to the east, rejoining NY  17M   – and the main line of the Erie Railroad   – at Goshen (exit  123). NY  17, its old former alignment (NY  17M) and the Erie run generally east-southeast, partly cross-country and partly through small stream valleys, to the end of the freeway, the directional change in NY  17 from east –west to north –south, and the junction of the Erie with its branch to Newburgh.

The route parallels the Thruway as it proceeds through a disjointed piece of Harriman State Park and enters the town of Tuxedo. While inside the park, NY  17 intersects Arden Valley Road, a highway that connects to Seven Lakes Drive deep inside the park. [ Harriman –Bear Mountain Trail Maps – Map 4 The New York –New Jersey Trail Conference 2005 ] South of Arden Valley Road, NY  17 briefly exits Harriman State Park and enters the hamlet of Southfields, where it intersects with County Route  19 (CR  19) and passes by the Red Apple Rest, a former restaurant and roadside attraction. Past the hamlet, the route heads back into the park and intersects with NY  17A and CR  106 near the park&apos;s western boundary. South of the junction, NY  17 leaves the Park and proceeds through a lightly populated area to the hamlet of Tuxedo Park. At the Tuxedo Park train station is access to a couple hiking trails in Harriman State Park. [ Harriman –Bear Mountain Trail Maps – Map 3 The New York –New Jersey Trail Conference 2005 ] The route continues on, paralleling the Thruway into Rockland County. On the other side of the county line, NY  17 enters the village of Sloatsburg, where it meets Seven Lakes Drive and connects to CR  72 by way of a modified trumpet interchange. Outside of Sloatsburg, NY  17 winds its way southeasterly along the Ramapo River and the Thruway through the town of Ramapo to the hamlet of the same name, based just north of NY  17&apos;s junction with NY  59. Here, NY  17 turns to the southwest, meeting the Thruway at exit  15A before traversing a sparsely developed area of the village of Hillburn. About [ 0.75 mi 2 ] south of the Thruway, NY  17 curves to the east, passing to the south of the v illage center as it approaches I-287. At Suffern Road, NY  17 becomes southbound only as it merges onto I-287 and proceeds to the New Jersey state line, where it connects to New Jersey&apos;s Route  17. [ History ] [ Origins ] The route of NY  17 was the main portion of an auto trail called the Liberty Highway, which connected New York City to Cleveland [ http://www.marion.ohio-state.edu/fac/schul/trails/national/liberty.html Liberty Highway National and Multi-State Auto Trails October 26, 1998 May 8, 2010 ] via Hackensack, Liberty, the Southern Tier, and Erie. [ July 2007 ] The alignment of the Liberty Highway from Westfield to Harriman was largely designated as Route  4, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Legislative Route  4 began at legislative Route  18 (current U.S. Route  20 or US  20) in Westfield and proceeded southeast through Mayville to Jamestown on what is now NY  394 and NY  430. From there, the route headed generally eastward to Salamanca over modern NY  394, NY  242, and NY  353, and southeast to Olean via NY  417. At Olean, the route shifted northward, passing through Hinsdale, Friendship, and Belvidere on current NY  16, NY  446 and Allegany County&apos;s CR  20 before returning southward on what is now NY  19 to access the village of Wellsville.

In between Andover and Jasper, however, Route  4 veered north on current NY  21 and NY  36 to serve Hornell. East of Corning, the alignment of legislative Route  4 more closely resembled the modern alignments of the Southern Tier Expressway and the Quickway. Route  4 exited Corning on what is now NY  352 and followed it to Big Flats, where it broke from NY  352 and proceeded to Horseheads on Chemung CR  64 and to Elmira on what is now Lake Road, Madison Avenue and the east end of NY  352. Between Elmira and Binghamton, Route  4 followed either local roads that were bypassed or upgraded into the Southern Tier Expressway, namely modern NY  17 and Chemung and Tioga CR  60 from Elmira to Waverly, NY  17C between Waverly and Owego, NY  434 from Owego to Vestal, and NY  17C and Riverside Drive (via NY  26 ) from Vestal to Binghamton. Route  4 exited the city on US  11 and followed it to Kirkwood Center, a hamlet adjacent to the eastern junction of NY  17 and I-81. From this point to Harriman, except for one section near Middletown, the path Route  4 followed became the basis for the Quickway several decades later. Between Kirkwood Center and Hancock, Route  4 utilized what was later upgraded into the Quickway (via Broome CR  28 from Windsor to Deposit ). East of here, it used parallel roads instead: modern &quot; Old Route  17 &quot; (Delaware CR  17 and Sullivan CRs  179A to  174) from Deposit to Monticello, Sullivan CRs  173 to  171 between Monticello and Bloomingburg, and Orange CR  76 and NY  17M from Bloomingburg to Harriman. At Harriman, Route  4 broke from the Liberty Highway and proceeded northeast over current US  6 and NY  293 to Highland Falls, where it ended at legislative Route  3 (modern US  9W ).

Scores of hotels, resorts and bungalow colonies attracted hundreds of thousands of vacationing New Yorkers, whose cars left the two-lane NY  17 hopelessly jammed in summer.

In response, New York State officials planned a four-lane replacement, the first free long-distance expressway in the state and one of the earliest in the United States. It would replace intersections with well-spaced access ramps, separate grades with flyovers, and allow safe travel at up to [ 65 mi/h km/h ]. [ Ingraham Joseph C.
