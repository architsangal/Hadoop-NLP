The phrase is also used to refer to a particular scene, episode or aspect of a show in which the writers use some type of &quot; gimmick &quot; in a desperate attempt to keep viewers&apos; interest. In its initial usage, it referred to the point in a television program &apos;s history when the program had outlived its freshness and viewers had begun to feel that the show&apos;s writers were out of new ideas, often after great effort was made to revive interest in the show by the writers, producers, or network.

[ History ] The phrase jump the shark comes from a scene in the fifth season premiere episode of the American TV series Happy Days titled &quot; Hollywood: Part 3 &quot;, written by Fred Fox, Jr. { First Person: In defense of &apos;Happy Days&apos; &apos; &apos;Jump the Shark&apos; episode, Los Angeles Times, September 3, 2010 } and aired on September 20, 1977. In the episode, the central characters visit Los Angeles, where a water-skiing Fonzie ( Henry Winkler ), wearing swim trunks and his trademark leather jacket, jumps over a confined shark, answering a challenge to demonstrate his bravery. For a show that in its early seasons depicted universally relatable experiences against a backdrop of 1950s nostalgia, this marked an audacious, cartoonish turn towards attention-seeking gimmickry and continued the faddish lionization of an increasingly superhuman Fonzie. The series continued for nearly five years after that, with a number of changes in cast and situations. However, it is commonly believed that the show, out of ideas and even trapped in its own success (largely due to the disproportionate popularity of the &quot; Fonzie &quot; character and the show&apos;s (executives&apos;) intense desire to continue &quot; milking &quot; that), began a downhill slide, becoming a caricature of itself often filled with little more than its popular catch phrases and character mannerisms. Hein published his list of approximately 200 television shows, and the moments each jumped the shark, in 1997. The site soon became an internet phenomenon, and as the phrase quickly spread all throughout pop culture the site grew exponentially in users and renown. Hein subsequently authored two &quot; Jump The Shark &quot; books and later became a regular on The Howard Stern Show around the time he sold his website to Gemstar (owners of TV Guide ). In a 2010 Los Angeles Times article, former Happy Days writer Fred Fox Jr., who wrote the episode that later spawned the phrase, said, &quot; Was the [shark jump] episode of Happy Days deserving of its fate? No, it wasn&apos;t. All successful shows eventually start to decline, but this was not Happy Days time. &quot; Fox also points to not only the success of the episode itself ( &quot; a huge hit &quot; with over 30  million viewers), but also to the continued popularity of the series.

The phrase refers to a scene in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull when Jones hides inside a lead -lined refrigerator to survive a nuclear blast, which throws the refrigerator all the way to safety. The scene was notable in that although the events of the Indiana Jones series were never intended to be realistic, the absurdity of the scene (lead can block nuclear fallout but not a nuclear blast, and the subsequent fall would have killed Jones in any case) was considered by many to be ridiculous even by its own standards of implausibility, and it was difficult for the rest of the film to maintain the sense of peril required for an action movie.
