[ 250px The Coalsack Nebula Coalsack Nebula Dark J2000.0 12 h 50 m −62° 30 &amp; prime; 600 ly – 7 &amp; times; 5 ° Crux 30–35 ly – – C99 ] The Coalsack Dark Nebula (or simply the Coalsack) is the most prominent dark nebula in the skies, easily visible to the naked eye as a dark patch silhouetted against the southern Milky Way. It was known pre-historically in the Southern Hemisphere and was observed by Vicente Yáñez Pinzón in 1499. The Coalsack is located at a distance of approximately 600 light year s away from Earth, in the Crux constellation. [ General information ] The Coalsack Dark Nebula covers nearly 7 ° by 5° and overlaps somewhat into the neighbour constellations Centaurus and Musca. Although this nebula was known to the people of the Southern Hemisphere in prehistoric times, { William F. Warren, Paradise found; the cradle of the human race at the North pole; a study of the prehistoric world, pp. 119-120. } its first observation was reported by Vicente Yáñez Pinzón in 1499.It was named “il Canopo fosco” (the dark Canopus ) by Amerigo Vespucci and was also called “Macula Magellani” (Magellan&apos;s Spot) or “Black Magellanic Cloud” in opposition to the Magellanic Clouds. In 1970, Kalevi Mattila proved the Coalsack is not totally black; it has a very dim glow (10% of the brightness of the surrounding Milky Way) which comes from the reflection of the stars it obscures. The Coalsack is not present in the New General Catalogue and in fact does not have an identification number (outside of the Caldwell Catalogue, in which it is C99). { Emu in the sky &quot;, which is an Australian Aboriginal constellation consisting of dark clouds rather than of stars.

Amongst the Wardaman people, it is said to be the head and shoulders of a law-man watching the people to ensure they don&apos;t break traditional law. According to a legend reported by W.E. Harney, this being is called Utdjungon and only adherence to the tribal law by surviving tribe members could prevent him from destroying the world with a fiery star. { Songs of the Songmen, 28-30. } In Inca astronomy, this nebula was called Yutu, meaning a partridge-like southern bird. { p. 5, &apos;&apos;The Hundred Greatest Stars&apos;&apos;, James B. Kaler, New York, Copernicus Books, 2002. } [ In fiction ] The Coalsack is mentioned in the Star Trek: The Original Series episodes &quot; The Immunity Syndrome &quot; and &quot; Let That Be Your Last Battlefield &quot;, as well as &quot; 2001: A Space Odyssey &quot; by Arthur C. Clarke. The Coalsack figures prominently in the Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle &apos;s science fiction novel The Mote in God&apos;s Eye and its sequels, The Gripping Hand and Outies { http://www.amazon.com/Outies-Mote-Gods-Eye-3/dp/0615434142/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=movies-tv &amp; ie=UTF8 &amp; qid=1318736760 &amp; sr=1-1-catcorr }.
