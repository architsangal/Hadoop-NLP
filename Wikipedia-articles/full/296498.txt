In addition to her, many other Japanese citizens were kidnapped by North Korean agents. In 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s, in order to train spies to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Japan. [ Chris Fortson Expert speaks on 1980s Japanese kidnappings http://www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID%3D20393 Yale Daily News October 28, 2002 October 11, 2007 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] Five people have been released, but the North Korean government claimed that there were eight dead. Japan has pressed for the return of the bodies. However, the Japanese government believes that there are still kidnapped Japanese citizens being held captive in North Korea. North Korea&apos;s official statement is that the issue has been settled. Because of the overwhelming number of South Koreans also kidnapped by North Korea, there has been some joint efforts of South Korea and Japan in retrieving their citizens.

Most of them are second-, third-, or fourth-generation Koreans who have not yet applied for Japanese citizenship. [ Some of them were either forced to relocate to or willingly immigrated to Japan during the Japanese occupation of Korea, January 2010 ] while others entered Japan illegally in order to escape the Korean War that took place after the Japanese occupation. They lost their Japanese citizenship after the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which officially ended the Japanese annexation of Korea and their country of origin, Korea, no longer existed when South Korea and North Korea became separate states. Zainichi communities are split based upon affiliation with North or South Korea, ( Chongryon and Mindan ). It is claimed that two or three of the leaders of the smaller organized crime syndicates found on a list of more than twenty such groups as specified by the National Police Agency in Japan may be ethnic Koreans. [ April 2012 ] More positively speaking, Masayoshi Son (손정의), Japan&apos;s businessman and chief of Softbank, is of Zainichi background. In addition, some of Japan&apos;s popular stars, athletes and high ranking businessmen were of Zainichi Korean background, including Rikidōzan (역도산), Mas Oyama (최배달), Isao Harimoto (장훈), and Kaneda Masaichi (김정일). In order to escape discrimination, there are Koreans living in Japan who use Japanese names to hide their origin. Today, however, as the relationship between Japan and Korea has improved, there also exist many Zainichi Koreans or former Zainichi Koreans with Japanese nationality who don&apos;t hide their origin and are in full activity, such as Yu Miri (유미리), an Akutagawa Prize -winning playwright and Tadanari Lee (이충성), a Japanese football player of Korean origin. [ Kimchi exports ] In the 1990s, a dispute arose regarding the marketing of kimchi, considered to be a traditional Korean dish. Japanese kimchi manufacturers [ March 2012 ] began significantly increasing kimchi production during this time. Korean manufacturers, however, argued that Japanese kimchi is fundamentally different, in that Japanese manufacturers often skip fermentation and mimic the flavors through the use of additives. Korean producers argued that this made the product fundamentally different from Kimchi, while Japanese producers [ March 2012 ] argued they were simply altering the product to fit local tastes. In 2000, Korea began lobbying the makers of the Codex Alimentarius, an international food-standards maker which provides voluntary advise to national food agencies, to designate kimchi as only that which is produced in the traditional Korean style. { Sims, Calvin (February 2000) &quot; Cabbage Is Cabbage? Not to Kimchi Lovers; Koreans Take Issue with a Rendition of Their National Dish Made in Japan &quot;. } { The New York Times. } In 2001 the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as &quot; a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature &quot;, but which did not specify a minimum amount of fermentation nor forbid the use of additives. { CODEX STANDARD FOR KIMCHI The Codex Alimentarius Commission } [ See also ] Japan–Korea relations [ References ] [ 30em ] [ Further reading ] [ Cha Victor D. 1999 Alignment despite Antagonism: the US-Korea-Japan Security Triangle Stanford Stanford University Press 0-8047-3191-8 ] [ Dudden Alexis 2008 Troubled Apologies Among Japan, Korea, and the United States New York Columbia University Press 978-0-231-14176-5 ] [ Lee Chong-Sik 1963 The Politics of Korean Nationalism Berkeley University of California Press ] [ Lee Chong-Sik 3 1985 Japan and Korea: The Political Dimension Stanford Stanford University Press 0-8179-8181-0 ] [ Lind Jennifer 2008 Sorry States: Apologies in International Politics Ithaca Cornell University Press 978-0-8014-4625-2 ] [ Myers Ramon Hawley et al. 1984 The Japanese Colonial Empire, 1895–1945 Princeton Princeton University Press 0-691-05398-7 ] [ Morley James 1965 Japan and Korea New York Walker ] [ External links ] History of Mindan Online Newspaper covering Zainichi Korean and Mindan [ Foreign relations of ] Disputes Category:Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea ja:日韓問題 zh:日韓問題
