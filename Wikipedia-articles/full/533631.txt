Brāhmī Kalinga U+0B00–U+0B7F Oriya 200px ] The Oriya script or Utkala Lipi ( Oriya : ଉତ୍କଳ ଲିପି) or Utkalakshara (Oriya: ଉତ୍କଳାକ୍ଷର) is used to write the Oriya language, and can be used for several other Indian languages, for example, Sanskrit. [ History ] The Oriya script is developed from the Kalinga script, one of the many descendants of the Brahmi script of ancient India. { Oriya Lipi, Satya N. Rajaguru, Orissa Sahitya Academy, Bhubaneswar, Orissa. Page 1-58 } The earliest known inscription in the Oriya language, in the Kalinga script, dates from 1051. Sample of the Oriya script as written from a Buddhist text from around 1060 AD, written by Sarahapada The script in the Ashokan edicts at Dhauli and Jaugada and the inscriptions of Kharavela in Hati Gumpha of Khandagiri give the first glimpse of possible origin of the Oriya language. From a linguistic perspective, the Hati Gumpha inscriptions are similar to modern Oriya and essentially different from the language of the Ashokan edicts. The question has also been raised as to whether Pali was the prevalent language in Orissa during this period. The Hati Gumpha inscriptions, which are in Pali, are perhaps the only evidence of stone inscriptions in Pali. This may be the reason why the famous German linguist Professor Oldenburg mentioned that Pali was the original language of Orissa. { Orissareview, Page 66-67 } There are noticeable similarities between Oriya and Thai script s, which provides clues about the Sadhavas, earlier Kalinga traders who traveled to south Asian countries and ruled there, leaving evidence of the Oriya script on the Thai script, along with a cultural impact. { http://indiannavy.nic.in/under2ensigns.pdf } { http://drs.nio.org/drs/bitstream/2264/127/3/Man_Environ_27_117.pdf } The curved appearance of the Oriya script is a result of the practice of writing on palm leaves, which has a tendency to tear the leaves when many straight lines are written. { Oriya alphabet, pronunciation and language } Oriya is a syllabic alphabet or an abugida wherein all consonants have an inherent vowel embedded within. Diacritic s (which can appear above, below, before, or after the consonant they belong to) are used to change the form of the inherent vowel. When vowels appear at the beginning of a syllable, they are written as independent letters. Also, when certain consonants occur together, special conjunct symbols are used to combine the essential parts of each consonant symbol. &quot; [ Oṛiyā ] is encumbered with the drawback of an excessively awkward and cumbrous written character.... At first glance, an [ Oṛiyā ] book seems to be all curves, and it takes a second look to notice that there is something inside each. &quot; ( G.A. Grierson, Linguistic Survey of India, 1903) Development of Oriyan scripts Development of ancient numerals in Oriya [ Oriya alphabet ] [ Independent vowels ] The vowels &quot; ଇ &quot; ( &quot; i &quot; ), &quot; ଈ &quot; ( &quot; ī &quot; ), &quot; ଉ &quot; ( &quot; u &quot; ) and &quot; ଊ &quot; ( &quot; ū &quot; ) are pronounced same as most long sounds are pronounced in the same way as short vowel sounds.

It is transliterated as ⟨a⟩, phonetic value [ [ɔ] ]. Its absence is marked by a halanta (virāma): File:Oriya Halant.gif For the other vowels diacritic s are used: [ [kɔ] ] [ [kɔ̃] ] [ [kɔŋ] ] [ [kɔh] ] [ [k] ] କ କଁ କଂ କଃ କ୍ ka kã kaṁ kaḥ k (Note: In many Oriya fonts the vowels e, ai, o, au do not display properly; these are given work-arounds in parentheses below.)

File:Oriya VowelLig1.gif File:Oriya VowelLig2.gif [ Consonant ligatures ] Clusters of two or more consonants form a ligature. Basically Oriya has two types of such consonant ligatures. The &quot; northern &quot; type is formed by fusion of two ore more consonants as in northern scripts like Devanāgarī (but to a lesser extent also in the Malayalam script in the south). In some instances the components can be easily identified, but sometimes completely new glyphs are formed. With the &quot; southern &quot; type the second component is reduced in size and put under the first as in the southern scripts used for Kannaḍa and Telugu (and to some extent also for Malayalam script ). The following table shows the most commonly used ligatures. (Different fonts may use different ligatures.) File:Oriya ConsLig.gif [ Special forms ] [ ⟨ẏ⟩ ] and ⟨r⟩ as components of a ligature are given a special treatment. As last member they become File:Oriya yvat.gif and File:Oriya rvat.gif respectively: File:Oriya yrLig.gif ⟨r⟩ as first member of a ligature becomes File:Oriya Reph.gif (called Repha as in other Indic scripts) and is shifted to the end of the ligature: File:Oriya RephLig.gif [ Ambiguities ] The Oriya alphabet exhibits quite a few ambiguities which add to the difficulties beginners encounter in learning it. Some of the letters of the script may easily be confounded. In order to reduce ambiguities a small oblique stroke is added at the lower right end as a diacritic. It resembles Halanta (Virāma) but it is joined to the letter, whereas Halanta is not joined. When the consonant forms a vowel ligature by which the lower right end is affected, this stroke is shifted to another position. This applies also to consonant ligatures baring the stroke (see table of consonant ligatures). File:Oriya Dia1.gif Some of the subjoined consonants, some other ligature components and variants of vowel diacritic s have changing functions: Open top consonants get a subjoined variant of the vowel diacritic for ⟨i⟩ as in File:Oriya Dia2.gif This same little hook is used in some consonant ligatures to denote ⟨t⟩ as first component: File:Oriya Dia3.gif The subjoined form of ⟨ch⟩ is also used for subjoined ⟨th⟩: File:Oriya Dia4.gif The subjoined form of ⟨bh⟩ serves also as a diacritic for different purposes: File:Oriya Dia5.gif The subjoined forms of [ ⟨ṇ⟩ ] and ⟨tu⟩ are almost identical: File:Oriya Dia6.gif The sign for the nasal [ ⟨ṁ⟩ ] may be used as a diacritic too: File:Oriya Dia7.gif [ Numerals ] ୦ ୧ ୨ ୩ ୪ ୫ ୬ ୭ ୮ ୯ ୵ ୶ ୷ ୲ ୳ ୴ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ¹⁄₁₆ ⅛ ³⁄₁₆ ¼ ½ ¾ [ Comparison of &lt; template type= &quot; IAST &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; Oṛiyā &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; script with its neighbours ] At a first look the great number of signs with round shapes suggests a closer relation to the southern neighbour Telugu than to the other neighbours Bengali in the north and Devanāgarī in the west. The reason for the round shapes in [ Oriya ] and Telugu (and also in Kannaḍa and Malayāḷam ) is the former method of writing using a stylus to scrutch the signs into a palm leaf. These tools do not allow for horizontal strokes because that would damage the leaf. Oriya letters are mostly round shaped whereas in Devanāgarī and Bengali have horizontal line. So in most cases the reader of [ Oṛiyā ] will find the distinctive parts of a letter only below the hoop. Considering this the following tables clearly show a closer relation to Devanāgarī and Bengali than to any southern script, though both northern and southern scripts have the same origin, Brāhmī. [ Vowel signs ] File:Oriya VowelComp.gif [ Consonant signs ] File:Oriya ConsComp.gif [ Vowel diacritics ] File:Oriya MatraComp.gif The treatment of ⟨e⟩ ⟨ai⟩ ⟨o⟩ ⟨au⟩ is similar to Bengali, Malayāḷam, Sinhalese, Tamiḻ, Grantha and also to SE Asian scripts like Burmese, Khmer and Thai, but it differs clearly from Devanāgarī, Gujarātī, Gurmukhī, Kannaḍa, Telugu and Tibetan.
