He served as an aide de camp to General George Washington, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. Letter from Tench Tilghman to George Washington, circa 1776-1781 Tilghman rose to become a trusted member of Washington&apos;s staff. The historic events of the time sparked his transformation from a privileged family member of Loyalists to a dedicated Patriot. Tench paid a high price, facing such tragedies as a split with his family and suffering an early death from disease contracted during the American Revolutionary War. [ Early Life ] Lieutenant Colonel Tench Tilghman was born on December 25, 1744. He was born at &quot; Fausley, &quot; the plantation owned by his father, James Tilghman, located on Fausley Creek, a branch of the St. Michaels River, in Talbot County, Maryand, U.S.A a few miles from the town of Easton. { Talbot County Free Library. &quot; Tench Tilghman. &quot; Talbot County Free Library.

In 1661, he moved his family to Talbot County, Maryland, settling in an area along the Third Haven River. Within a short time, Richard moved to the &quot; Hermitage, &quot; located on the Chester River, then in Kent County, but today in Queen Anne’s County. { http://www.marylandtheseventhstate.com/article1010.html } Richard’s son, James Tilghman, was a distinguished gentleman lawyer, who is recognized as an important Maryland figure in his time. [ College of Philadelphia to Yorktown: 1761-1781 ] One could argue that in 1761, that Tilghman was not destined to become a revolutionary.

Albany, NY 1876 } I am placed in as delicate a situation as it is possible for a man to be. I am, from my station, a master of the most valuable secrets of the Cabinet, and the master of the field and it might give cause of umbrage and suspicion at the this critical moment to interest myself in procuring the passage of a brother to England. [ &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Tories &quot; &gt; Tories &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; /link &gt; burn Tench’s business ] At the start of the Revolution, Tench ran a saddle-making business which began to decline when the Non-Importation Resolution made it impossible to import British goods. { About Famous People, Tench Tilghman by John T.

Centreville, Maryland: Tidewater Publishers, 1982. } The obstinacy of the King and his unwillingness to acknowledge the independency of this country, I have ever considered as the greatest obstacles in the way of a peace. Tench Tilghman’s Yorktown Journal October 17, 1781 at the Siege of Yorktown: { The Yorktown Journal of Tench Tilghman, 1781. At the Library of Congress } In the morning Lord Cornwallis put out a letter requesting 24 hours must be granted to the commissioners to settle terms of capitulation of the posts of York and Gloster. The General answered that only two hours would be allowed for him to send out his terms. He accordingly sent them out generally as follows, that the Garrisons should be prisoners of war, the German and British soldiers to be sent to England and Germany. The General answered on the 18th that the terms of sending the troops to England and Germany were inadmissible. Lord Cornwallis closed with all the terms except the same honors granted at Charlestown. [ Carries surrender papers to Yorktown ] The Siege of Yorktown in October 1781 marked the start of the Patriot’s victory and an honor for Tench who Washington picked to carry the surrender papers to Philadelphia. { O’Dea, Merle, “Growing Pains: Tench Tilghman vs. Paul Revere,” April 18, 1941, The Easton Star-Democrat. } { Wroten, William H., “Colonel Tench Tilghman,” February 28, 1962, Salisbury Times. } { “A Talbot Man More Deserving of Fame than Paul Revere,” July 7, 1928.

Centreville, Maryland: Tidewater Publishers, 1982. } “Till your letter of the 28th arrived which is the first from you and the only direct account of you since we departed at Philadelphia, we have various conjectures about you. Some thought you were dead—others that you were married—and all that you have forgot us. Your letter is not a more evident contradiction of the first and last of these suppositions than it is a tacit conformation of the second and as more can wish you greater success in the prosecution of the plan you are upon than I do...you have no friend who wishes more to see you than I do.” [ Later life and death ] The American Revolutionary War was a war in which disease was a major killer.University of Illinois at Chicago writes: &quot; Disease killed far more soldiers than did combat. Of the 100,000 to 150,000 men who served in U.S. forces at one time or another, about 6,800 died in battle, while disease [killed] 10,000 in camp and 8,500 in British prisons. &quot; { http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/am-rev.htm } Tench was among those who contracted disease during the war.

The museum writes: &quot; The letter...refers to an ongoingpersonal and business relationship in which Tilghman shipped wheat, tobacco and otherAmerican products to Spain, and Riera [head of the Spanish company] shipped wine and manufactured products to Baltimore, using “bills of exchange” of their respective ships’ cargoes. &quot; { http://www.oxfordmuseum.org/IMAGES/TilghmanLtr.pdf } George Washington’s letters to brother Richard Tilghman on May 10th,1786 shows his fondness for Tilghman: { Shreve, L.G, Tench Tilghman: The Life and Times of Washington’s Aide-de-Camp. Centreville, Maryland: Tidewater Publishers, 1982. } As there were few man for whom I had a warmer friendship or greater regard for your brother Colonel Tilghman—when living; so, with much truth I can assure you that there are whose death I could have more sincerely regretted—And I pray you and his numerous friends to permit me to mingle my sorrows with theirs on this unexpected and melancholy occasion. About a month later, on June 5, 1786 he writes to Richard Tilghman: { Shreve, L.G, Tench Tilghman: The Life and Times of Washington’s Aide-de-Camp. Centreville, Maryland: Tidewater Publishers, 1982. } {...none could have felt his death with more regard than I did, because no one entertained a higher opinion of his worth. } Tench Tilghman is buried in the Oxford, Maryland cemetery.
