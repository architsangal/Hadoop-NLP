He is noted for being one of the principal voice actors on the animated television series The Simpsons (1989–present), on which he performs the voices of Moe Szyslak, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Chief Wiggum, Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson and numerous others. Azaria, who attended Tufts University, joined the show with little voice acting experience, but became a regular in its second season. Many of his performances on the show are based on famous actors and characters; Moe&apos;s voice, for example, is based on actor Al Pacino. Alongside his continued voice acting on The Simpsons, Azaria became more widely known through his live-action appearances in films such as The Birdcage (1996) and Godzilla (1998). He has continued to star in numerous films including Mystery Men (1999), America&apos;s Sweethearts (2001), Shattered Glass (2003), Along Came Polly (2004), Run Fatboy Run (2007), Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and The Smurfs (2011). He also had recurring roles on the television series Mad About You and Friends, and starred in the drama Huff (2004–2006), playing the titular character, as well as appearing in the popular stage musical Spamalot. Originally primarily a comic actor, in recent years Azaria has taken on more dramatic roles including the TV films Tuesdays With Morrie (1999) and Uprising (2001). He has won four Emmys and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Azaria was married to actress Helen Hunt from 1999 to 2000. [ Early life ] Azaria was born Henry Albert Azaria on April 25, 1964 in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, the son of Sephardic Jewish parents from Thessaloniki, Greece.

During his childhood, Azaria often &quot; memorize[d] and mimic[ked] &quot; the scripts of the films, shows and stand-up comedy routines that he enjoyed. Azaria attended The Kew-Forest School in Forest Hills. He did not consciously decide to become an actor until he performed in a school play at the age of 16, becoming, at the expense of his academic studies, &quot; obsessed with acting. &quot; Both of his parents loved all forms of show business, which further spurred him to become an actor. He studied drama at Tufts University until 1985, [ Cartoon voice-over brings quiet fame 1991-10-23 Telegram &amp; Gazette Daniel M. Kimmel A11 ] before training at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

Azaria&apos;s first acting job was an advertisement for Italian television when he was seventeen years old. He also worked as a busboy. Azaria originally intended to work predominantly as a theatrical actor, and he and Platt set up their own company, named Big Theatre, although Harold Pinter &apos;s The Dumb Waiter was the only thing they ever performed. He decided that television was a better arena and offered more opportunity so, after being offered work with talent agent Harry Gold, Azaria moved to Los Angeles. [ Career ] [ Early career (1986–1989) ] After arriving in Los Angeles in 1986, Azaria met with Harry Gold. The agent was lukewarm about working with him, but a woman Azaria had &quot; worked with in New York got really furious with him because he said he&apos;d work with me and then didn&apos;t, &quot; so Gold began sending him out for auditions. He made his first television appearance with a role in the pilot episode of the 1986 ABC comedy-drama series Joe Bash, with Peter Boyle. His part – a one-line role as the police officer Maldonado – was edited out before the show was broadcast, although the role secured him admission to the Screen Actors Guild. Azaria appeared in the TV film Nitti: The Enforcer, about the gangster Frank Nitti, and appeared in the failed pilot Morning Maggie, alongside Matthew Perry, with whom he became good friends. He played Joe in an episode of the sitcom Family Ties in 1988, in which he had one line and the following year he played Steve Stevenson in an episode of Growing Pains.

Club ] Azaria has described his career progression as being gradual; he did not achieve overnight recognition or fame. In Los Angeles, Azaria was trained by acting coach Roy London. Between acting jobs he performed as a stand-up comedian, and worked as a bartender for a catering firm.

He joined the show having previously performed only one voice over: as the titular animated dog in the failed Fox pilot Hollywood Dog, a show he described as &quot; sort of Roger Rabbit -esque, where the dog was animated but everybody else was real. &quot; The first voice he performed on The Simpsons was that of town bartender Moe Szyslak, replacing Christopher Collins who had initially recorded the character&apos;s voice. Having known him from Hollywood Dog, casting director Bonita Pietila called Azaria and asked him to audition for the voice of Moe. At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play, utilizing a voice based on actor Al Pacino &apos;s performance in the film Dog Day Afternoon. He used the voice in his audition for The Simpsons and, at the request of the show&apos;s executive producers Matt Groening and Sam Simon, made the voice more &quot; gravelly &quot;. Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot;, dubbing Collins&apos; voice.

He felt that, initially, &quot; [the producers] didn&apos;t seem too pleased with what I had done...[Simon] was very exacting...[and] was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I thought it was going to be my last week, because I really didn&apos;t think I had done that well. &quot; Nevertheless, by the show&apos;s second season he was performing multiple recurring voices, and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. As he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the &quot; new guy &quot;. [ Groening, Matt 2001 The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Some Enchanted Evening &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of the Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous other one-time characters. [ McCann Jesse L. Matt Groening The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family...Still Continued 2002 Harper Collins Publishers 0-06-050592-3 116 ] As Moe&apos;s voice is based on Al Pacino, likewise many of Azaria&apos;s other recurring characters are based on existing sources. He took Apu&apos;s voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area, and also loosely based it on Peter Sellers &apos; character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film The Party. Originally, it was thought that Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotyped, but after Azaria&apos;s reading of the line &quot; Hello, Mr. Homer &quot;, which the show&apos;s producers thought was hilarious, the character stayed. [ Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves 2000-10-21 TV Guide Joe Rhodes ] Azaria, however, disputed this on LateNet with Ray Ellin, claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical. [ Hank Azaria Ray Ellin Hank Azaria on LateNet with Ray Ellin http://www.dailycomedy.com/joke/10559 LateNet with Ray Ellin Daily Comedy 2007-12-05 2008-04-03 ] Chief Wiggum&apos;s voice was originally a parody of David Brinkley, but when Azaria was told it was too slow, he switched it to that of Edward G. Robinson. Officer Lou is based on Sylvester Stallone, and Dr. Nick is &quot; a bad Ricky Ricardo impression. &quot; [ Azaria, Hank 2004 The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Triple Bypass &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] The &quot; Wise Guy &quot; voice is &quot; basically Charles Bronson, &quot; [ Azaria, Hank 2004 The Simpsons The Complete Fifth Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Barbershop Quartet &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] while Carl is &quot; a silly voice [Azaria] always did. &quot; Two of the voices come from his time at college: Snake&apos;s is based on Azaria&apos;s old college roommate, while Comic Book Guy&apos;s voice is based on a student, who lived in the room next door to Azaria, who went by the name &quot; F &quot;. Professor Frink is based on Jerry Lewis &apos;s performance in the original The Nutty Professor, and the Sea Captain is based on English actor Robert Newton &apos;s portrayal of many pirates. Azaria based his performance for the one-time character Frank Grimes, from the episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Enemy &quot;, on actor William H. Macy. He counts Grimes as the hardest, most emotional performance he has ever had to give in the history of The Simpsons. [ Azaria, Hank 2006 The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot; Homer&apos;s Enemy &quot; DVD 20th Century Fox ] Azaria&apos;s work on the show has won him three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, in 1998, 2001 and 2003. He was also nominated for the award in 2009 and 2010, but lost to co-star Dan Castellaneta and guest star Anne Hathaway respectively.

Up until 1998, Azaria was paid $30,000 per episode. Azaria and the five other main The Simpsons voice actors were then involved in a pay dispute in which Fox threatened to replace them with new actors, and went as far as preparing for casting of new voices. However, the issue was soon resolved and from 1998 to 2004, they received $125,000 per episode. In 2004, the voice actors intentionally skipped several script read-through s, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode.

Following the series&apos; cancellation Azaria unsucessfully auditioned for the role of Joey Tribbiani, one of the lead characters in the sitcom Friends. He was instead cast in the role of the scientist David, one of Phoebe Buffay &apos;s boyfriends in the series. He appeared in the show&apos;s tenth episode &quot; The One with the Monkey &quot;, before the character left for a research trip in Minsk. He reprised the role in the show&apos;s seventh season (2001), before making several appearances in the ninth (2003). This return culminates in David proposing to Phoebe; she rejects him, and David leaves the show for good. From 1995 to 1999, Azaria had a recurring role in the sitcom Mad About You as Nat Ostertag, the dog walker. Azaria was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his roles in both Mad About You (in 1998) and Friends (in 2003).

We had a bunch of executives sitting in the room, all agreeing that The Larry Sanders Show was our favorite thing on television, but we couldn&apos;t do it on NBC, and nor would we want to from a business standpoint; it simply wouldn&apos;t make enough money. By the time it aired, the writing was sort of on the wall, and I don&apos;t blame them at all. It was apparent it wasn&apos;t working. &quot; He starred as psychiatrist Craig &quot; Huff &quot; Huffstodt in the Showtime drama series Huff, which ran for two seasons between 2004 and 2006, airing 24 episodes.

Azaria enjoyed working on the show, but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator Bob Lowry, noting that it &quot; was tough to marry our visions all the time, [because] we both cared so much about it that neither of us were willing to let go. &quot; Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly called Azaria &quot; impressively subtle &quot; in the role, [ http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C735661%2C00.html Huff Entertainment Weekly 2004-11-05 2011-08-01 Flynn, Gillian ] while John Leonard of New York said he was a &quot; shrewd bit of casting. &quot; [ http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/reviews/10261/ Crazy/Dutiful Leonard, John New York 2005-05-21 2011-08-01 ] The show garnered seven Emmy nominations in 2005, including a nomination for Azaria for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.

It&apos;s a wonderful, odd moment that could have failed miserably in the hands of a lesser actor, and he manages to pull it off with only seconds of dialogue.

His first theatrically released feature film appearance was in the 1990 film Pretty Woman, as a police detective, His next major film role was television producer Albert Freedman in the 1994 Academy Award -nominated film Quiz Show. In 1996, Azaria played gay Guatemalan housekeeper Agador Spartacus in the film The Birdcage. For the role, which Azaria considers to be his &quot; big break &quot;, he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, and critically branded &quot; the most hilarious performance in the film, &quot; by Alison Macor of The Austin Chronicle, [ http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film%3Doid%3A138262 The Birdcage 2007-12-31 Alison Macor 1996-03-08 The Austin Chronicle ] while Empire wrote that he &quot; [stole] the show. &quot; [ http://www.empireonline.com/features/remakes/default.asp?film%3D42 Remakes That Worked: The Birdcage Empire 2010-07-16 2011-04-16 ] For the role he used a Guatemalan accent, and made himself sound as effeminate as possible. He had chosen two possible voices, an effeminate one and a tougher one. After advice from a drag queen, he chose the effeminate voice. Three weeks into production, he realized he sounded exactly like his grandmother, which aided his performance. Agador was originally going to be a single scene part, with the larger role of housekeeper being played by David Alan Grier. Fearing the racial connotations of a black actor in such a part, Azaria inherited the full role. He appeared in numerous other films in the late 1990s, including Heat (1995), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), Celebrity (1998) and worked opposite Gwyneth Paltrow, as Walter Plane, in the 1998 adaptation of Great Expectations. He played photographer Victor &quot; Animal &quot; Palotti in the 1998 film Godzilla. Godzilla was one of Azaria&apos;s first starring roles in a blockbuster film. Its five-month shoot was the longest of his career to date, but he considered it a good chance to boost his profile. He noted, &quot; I&apos;m so used to melding into every character I play. Even people in the business think the guy who did Birdcage, Quiz Show and Great Expectations are three different actors—which in a way makes me proud, but in another way is very frustrating. It&apos;s the curse and blessing of the character actor &quot;. The shoot&apos;s physical challenges, and the film&apos;s critical and commercial failure, led Azaria to later describe it as &quot; tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one you definitely chalk up and say, &apos;That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time&apos;. &quot; In 1999, he starred in the drama Mystery, Alaska as Charles Danner, and the comedy superhero film Mystery Men, as the faux-British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja. Other film roles included Hector Gorgonzolas in America&apos;s Sweethearts (2001), Claude in Along Came Polly (2004), and the young Patches O&apos;Houlihan in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004), the latter two with Ben Stiller. For his role of Claude, a French scuba instructor, in Along Came Polly, Azaria donned a wig and worked out extensively to get into the physical shape the part required.

[ His million faces – Hank Azaria adds more characters for &apos;Imagine That&apos; Ventura County Star Dave Mason 2002-01-13 K03 ] Azaria commented: &quot; all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, &apos;OK, now it&apos;s time to get a dramatic role.&apos; &quot; His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt&apos;s leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film&apos;s producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. &quot; I know [Avnet] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in [Uprising], and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don&apos;t understand why. &quot; His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be &quot; very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging &quot; material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film &quot; has become a weird kind of eulogy to him. &quot; [ http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/A/Azaria_Hank/2004/01/19/756458.html Hank Azaria buffs up for Polly 2011-09-11 Hobson, Louis B. 2004-01-19 Canoe.ca ] Since Huff s conclusion in 2006, Azaria has made multiple film appearances.
