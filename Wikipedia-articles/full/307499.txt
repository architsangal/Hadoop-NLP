It is nicknamed Brazilian California, because of a combination of an economy based on agrobusiness plus high technology, wealth and sunny weather all year long. With 605,114 inhabitants, Ribeirão Preto is the ninth largest municipality in the state. With a total area of 652.2  km² (251.8 sq mi), its coordinates are 21° 10’ 42 &quot; South latitude and 47° 48’ 24 &quot; West longitude; and it is situated 313  km (194  mi) from the city of São Paulo and 706  km (439  mi) from Brasília, the federal capital. Mean altitude is 546.8 meters high (1,794  ft). [ Population ] The population of Ribeirão Preto includes, amongst other groups, descendents of Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Japanese immigrant s who were attracted to the region because of the coffee agriculture, right after the Abolition of Slavery in 1888, when immigrants were granted lands, after being indentured workers. Descendants of African slaves also constituted a big parcel of the population. Italians arrived in huge numbers, followed by Germans, Spaniards, Eastern Europe ans, and Portuguese. During the 1990s, Northeastern migrants came to the region attracted by the economic development of São Paulo state cities, which was widely broadcast in TV documentaries. With the super population of the city by individuals who often had no technical skills and were often illiterate, poverty and crime grew considerably. Many migrants boosted the economy by working in sugar cane plantations and orange groves though. However, those who perform seasonal duties, often have no safe net, when the work is over. IBGE research indicate that Ribeirão Preto has a population of 605.114 inhabitants. [ http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/default.php IBGE - Cidades ] The urban agglomeration incorporates 34 municipalities, with a population about 1.4 million inhabitants.

The city was laid by a stream called Black Creek, and was named after it (Ribeirão Preto means black creek in Portuguese, sometimes the city name is translated as &quot; Black Stream &quot;, which is also the name of a hotel in the city). Eventually the farmers’ choice revealed itself as very adequate and the fertile soil of the Ribeirão Preto region allowed the highest crop productivity in Brazil. The rapid development of the coffee cultivation brought wealth and progress to the city, which by the 1880s had become the largest coffee producer in the world. Coffee, the “green gold” as it was called, was responsible for a kind of “gold rush” in the region, which attracted workers and adventurous people from several parts of the world. This movement was helped by the new Mogiana Railway, which linked Ribeirão Preto to São Paulo and to the port city of Santos, and by the abolition of slavery in Brazil, in 1888. The end of slavery created a strong demand for labor and the “coffee barons”, as the coffee farmers were called, stimulated Europe an immigration - mostly from Italy but also from Portugal, Spain and Germany - to Ribeirão Preto. Later, after the stock market crash of 1929, several of these immigrant s bought the farm s from their indebted former employers. [ Culture ] Teatro Pedro II At the beginning of the 20th century and during its first three decades, Ribeirão Preto was a rich city, boasting several mansion s, European-style café s, cabaret s and even two opera house s. One of the opera houses - the Carlos Gomes Theatre (in honour of Brazilian opera composer Carlos Gomes ) - was demolished in 1949 but the other - the &quot; Pedro II Theatre &quot; (named in honor of Emperor Dom Pedro II ), dating from the 1920s - resisted time and was restored and modernized during the 1990s. Its ceiling, completely destroyed in a fire of 1980, was rebuilt and gained a new design projected by Japanese-Brazilian artist Tomie Ohtake. The Pedro II Theatre is now the third largest opera house in Brazil and is the home of the Ribeirão Preto symphony orchestra, one of the oldest and most important in Brazil. An important fact for the city life happened in 1911 with the opening of its first factory, the Antarctica Brewery Company, nowadays part of the AmBev group. It was Antarctica which built the Pedro II Theatre. The Antarctica factory led to the opening of several beer house s in the city and one of them named Pinguim (penguin in Portuguese), became particularly famous and made Ribeirão Preto nationally renowned for the quality of its draft beer (chope or chopp in Brazilian Portuguese). Many people say that Pinguim has the best draft beer in Brazil and it became so important that it is now a symbol of the city; people say that coming to Ribeirão Preto and not visiting Pinguim is like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope. There are four Pinguim beer houses in Ribeirão Preto: two of them, called Pinguim 1 and 2 respectively, are at the November XV square (the central square of Ribeirão Preto) right beside the Pedro II Theatre). The other two are at the shopping centers Santa Úrsula and Ribeirão Shopping respectively. By the way, the Penguin beer house was named after the Antarctica company&apos;s logo (see at ).Many small &quot; alambiques &quot; exist in the region, each producing its own singular &quot; Pinga, &quot; better known as Cachaça. These &quot; Pingas &quot; are often aged and are available in many flavours, while still maintaining their flair. Pinguim is not the only good beer house in Ribeirão Preto. Ribeirão Preto is a hot climate city, which makes people go out in the evening to chat and enjoy cold draft beers in bars. Therefore, the city is teeming with bars, from the simple &quot; botequins &quot; or &quot; botecos &quot; that one can find in almost every corner, to the most sophisticated pub style bars, which rival their counterparts in São Paulo and Rio. Ribeirão Preto also has one of the first micro-breweries in Brazil, Cervejaria Colorado, founded in 1997. It produces three different types of beers, two ales and one lager. Cervejaria Colorado is located at Rua Minas and has a bar at Avenida Independencia where it offers 70 different labels of beer from all over the world. &quot; Curupira &quot; Park. [ Parks and forests ] Ribeirão Preto has many parks, gardens and a zoo [ http://www.ribeiraopreto.sp.gov.br/guia/i99pracas.htm Parks and gardens ] e.g. Fábio Barreto municipal forest, municipal park called &quot; Curupira &quot;, officially named Luís Roberto Jábali Park, the Botanical Garden Park, named as Luís Carlos Raya Park, both located in the south zone, Tom Jobim Park, located in the northwest region and the Maurílio Biagi Park, located in the central region. [ Sports ] Lately Ribeirão Preto&apos;s highest sports acclaim comes in basketball. The team plays under the name COC-Ribeirão Preto (Colegio Oswaldo Cruz) and finished 1st in the National Championship first division in 2003. Other finishes of note include championships in the Paulista league (state of São Paulo) in &apos;02,&apos;03,&apos;04,&apos;05 and &apos;06 when was champion. COC-Ribeirão Preto plays its home games in the Gym &quot; Cava do Bosque &quot;, which is located on the land associated with the Municipal Park of Sports. The city also possesses two soccer stadium s, the Estádio Palma Travassos (of Comercial FC ) and Santa Cruz (of Botafogo FC ). Neither Comercial nor Botafogo are currently in Brazil&apos;s top three soccer divisions. On the national and international scene, Botafogo is often confused with the Rio de Janeiro club with the same name to the extent that the Rio club is often credited with being the infamous club against which Pelé scored a record 8 goals in one game. One example is in Franklin Foer&apos;s book &quot; How Soccer Explains the World &quot;. But it was in the Paulista championships on November 21, 1964 in the costal city of Santos and against the Ribeirão Preto team that Pelé achieved the incredible feat and his Santos team won by an 11 x 0 score. The 8 goals were payback for the defeat Santos suffered on September 6, 1964 when they visited Ribeirão Preto during the first round of the tournament and lost 2 x 0. Not only had a &quot; small &quot; team beaten one of the &quot; big &quot; teams, but had done so while insulting the &quot; King &quot;. A better claim to fame for Botafogo (often referred to as Botafogo-SP) is that Brazilian soccer captains (and brothers) Sócrates and Raí started their careers with Botafogo. [ Education ] A noteworthy fact is that it was during the economic stagnation period from the 1940s to the 1950s that the city discovered and established its vocation as an educational and university center. In 1942 the state government expropriated the Monte Alegre Farm, which was an important coffee farm from the Schmidt family of German immigrants, to transform it into an agricultural practical school. Several new buildings and houses for the professors were constructed over a land which held before tens of thousands of coffee plants. The new school was very well planned and urbanized and many trees were planted to provide shadow and give it a pleasant atmosphere. But the agricultural school never achieved a significant development and it was closed in 1951. A longstanding dream of the population of Ribeirão Preto was to have a university and in 1952 the old farm was donated to the University of São Paulo for the creation of a medical school, which was the first school of its campus at Ribeirão Preto. Fortunately, many original buildings of the agricultural school and even some of the Monte Alegre Farm were preserved and only adapted to hold the new university, which makes its campus one of the most beautiful university campuses in Brazil. After the creation of the medical school the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto (USP-RP) has been growing steadily and it is presently constituted by eight schools: School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto (FMRP), School of Law of Ribeirão Preto (FDRP), School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters (FFCLRP), School of Dentistry (FORP), School of Economics, Administration and Accounting (FEARP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFRP), School of Nursing (EERP) and School of Music (DMRP-ECA). The creation of USP-RP stimulated the cultural and academic life in Ribeirão Preto and several schools, colleges and universities were opened in the city since then. Nowadays the town has many other colleges and faculties such as Centro Universitário Moura Lacerda, Faculdades Bandeirantes, Centro Universitário Barão da Mauá, Faculdade Anhanguera, Faculdade Reges, Faculdade São Luís, Faculdades COC, Universidade de Ribeirão Preto (UNAERP), Universidade Paulista (UNIP), Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP), Fundação Fritz Muller (FFM), FGV-COC ( Fundação Getúlio Vargas ). One interesting fact is that in Ribeirão Preto there is one Local Cometee of AIESEC. Present in over 110 countries and territories and with over 60,000 members, AIESEC is the world&apos;s largest student-run organisation. Focused on providing a platform for youth leadership development, AIESEC offers young people the opportunity to be global citizens, to change the world, and to get experience and skills that matter today. Their office is in Rua das Paiseiras, casa 9, USP, Monte Alegre. [ Economy ] [ July 2010 ] The Santa Elisa sugarcane processing plant, one of the largest and oldest in Brazil, is located near Ribeirão Preto. Typical sugarcane harvest transport near Ribeirão Preto After the New York Stock Exchange crash of 1929 the economy of Ribeirão Preto, based on a single export crop, collapsed, and the city had to adapt to a new situation. Since the city is relatively far from other major Brazilian urban centers, it found a new economic vocation in the services and commercial sector, which was developed to attend the local and regional demands. [ July 2010 ] The second economic boom in the history of Ribeirão Preto occurred after the oil crisis ( 1973 and 1979 ) of the 1970s. The increase in the oil price obliged Brazil to look for alternative means of fuel ing and the solution found was the alcohol fuel program, or Pro-Álcool as it is called. Pró-Álcool led to the development of a technology which allows the use of ethanol ( sugarcane alcohol) either as automotive fuel or as a gasoline additive. The latter improves performance and substitutes lead thus decreasing polluting emissions. Due to the Pró-Álcool program, farmers from the region of Ribeirão Preto were encouraged by government subsidies to grow sugarcane. The high productivity of the land around Ribeirão Preto rapidly placed the region as the largest alcohol and sugar producer of the world, being responsible for 30 percent of Brazil’s sugarcane alcohol fuel. [ July 2010 ] Contrary to what happened during the city&apos;s first economic boom, this time Ribeirão Preto farmers and entrepreneurs did not concentrate themselves exclusively on a single crop and diversified their investments making the city one of the most important agribusiness centers of Brazil. Besides sugar and alcohol, Ribeirão Preto&apos;s major products are orange juice, cotton, rice, meat, dairy products, textiles, machinery, steel, furniture, building materials, agrochemical s, pharmaceuticals and, of course, beer. The city hosts &quot; Agrishow &quot; on an annual basis, this show being one of the most important agricultural trade shows in Brazil. [ July 2010 ] The sugarcane boom brought a new age of prosperity for the city, which was called the &quot; Brazilian California &quot; during the 1980s and early 1990s. On the one hand, this has increased the city&apos;s wealth and turned it into a sophisticated center of services for Brazil and South America but, on the other hand, the image of a new &quot; Eldorado &quot; attracted many migrants from impoverished areas of Brazil leading to a rapid population growth and the appearance of slum s (favelas as they are called in Brazil) including all the negative aspects associated with them like drug trafficking and high violence and crime rates, an unfortunate fact that Ribeirão Preto shares with all other major Brazilian cities. [ July 2010 ] The airline Passaredo Transportes Aéreos has its headquarters in the Jardim Aeroporto area of the city. { &quot; Fale Conosco. &quot; } { Passaredo Transportes Aéreos. Retrieved on July 5, 2010. } [ Government ] The mayor, Dárcy Vera (from the Democrats party coalition (formerly the Party of the Liberal Front), was elected in 2008 and took office on January 1, 2009. It is the first time that the city takes a woman as mayor. She was elected with 154,397 votes (52,04% of the votes). Her term of office is four years (until December 31, 2012), and she plans running for the 2010 elections as Federal Deputy. [ Subdivisions ] Besides the main administration, the city has three regional administrations (sub city halls): [ http://www.ribeiraopreto.sp.gov.br/regional/ce/i12PRINCIPAL.ASP?pagina%3D%2Fregional%2FCE%2FI12principal.htm Portal da Cidade de Ribeirão Preto ] Regional administration 1: North (Campos Elísios) Regional administration 2: West (Vila Tibério) Regional administration 3: South ( Bonfim Paulista ) [ Transportation ] [ Public transportation ] [ http://www.ribeiraopreto.sp.gov.br/transerp/i07principal.asp?pagina%3D%2Ftranserp%2Fcentral%2Fi07indi.htm Bus Routes ] [ http://www.ribeiraopreto.sp.gov.br/transerp/i07principal.asp?pagina%3D%2Ftranserp%2Fcentral%2Fi07indi.htm Micro Bus Routes ] [ http://www.ribeiraopreto.sp.gov.br/transerp/i07principal.asp?pagina%3D%2Ftranserp%2Fi07servicos.htm%26amp%3Bancora%3Dcarteiraescolar Transerp ] The Ribeirão Preto&apos;s public transportation system is operated by three companies and about 300 buses that attend 113 lines and routes.
