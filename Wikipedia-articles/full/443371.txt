Ānāpānasati ( Pali; Sanskrit : ānāpānasmṛti; Chinese : 安那般那; Pīnyīn : ānnàbānnà), meaning &apos; mindfulness of breath ing &apos; ( &quot; sati &quot; means mindfulness; &quot; ānāpāna &quot; refers to inhalation and exhalation), is a form of Buddhist meditation now common to the Tibetan, Zen, Tiantai, and Theravada schools of Buddhism, as well as western-based mindfulness programs. According to tradition, Anapanasati was originally taught by the Buddha in several sutras including the Ānāpānasati Sutta. { In the Pali canon, the instructions for anapanasati are presented as either one tetrad (four instructions) or four tetrads (16 instructions). The most famous exposition of four tetrads – after which } { Theravada countries have a national holiday (see } { uposatha ) – is the Anapanasati Sutta, found in the } { Majjhima Nikaya (MN), sutta number 118 (for instance, see Thanissaro, 2006 ). Other discourses which describe the full four tetrads can be found in the } { Samyutta Nikaya &apos;s Anapana-samyutta (Ch. 54), such as SN 54.6 (Thanissaro, 2006a), SN 54.8 (Thanissaro, 2006b) and SN 54.13 (Thanissaro, 1995a). The one-tetrad exposition of anapanasati is found, for instance, in the Kayagata-sati Sutta ( } { MN 119; Thanissaro, 1997), the Maha-satipatthana Sutta ( } { DN 22; Thanissaro, 2000) and the } { Satipatthana Sutta (MN 10; Thanissaro, 1995b). } (MN 118) Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body, as is practiced in the context of mindfulness. [ Origins in Buddhism ] Anapanasati is a core meditation practice in Theravada, Tiantai, and Chán/Zen traditions of Buddhism, as well as a part of many modern Western mindfulness-based programs. In both ancient and modern times, anapanasati by itself is likely the most widely used Buddhist method for contemplating bodily phenomena. { An } [ ā ] { layo (2006), p. 125. } The Anapanasati Sutta specifically concerns mindfulness of inhalation and exhalation, as a part of paying attention to one&apos;s body in quietude, and recommends the practice of ānāpānasati meditation as a means of cultivating the seven factors of awakening : sati (mindfulness), dhamma vicaya (analysis), viriya (persistence), which leads to pīti (rapture), then to passaddhi (serenity), which in turn leads to samadhi (concentration) and then to upekkhā (equanimity). Finally, the Buddha taught that, with these factors developed in this progression, the practice of ānāpānasati would lead to release (Pali: nibbāna; Sanskrit: nirvana) from suffering ( dukkha ). Traditionally, anapanasati has been used as a basis for developing meditative concentration ( samadhi ) until reaching the state and practice of full absorption ( jhana ). [ July 2010 ] It is the same state reached by the Buddha during his quest for Enlightenment. [ http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/buddha.html A Sketch of the Buddha&apos;s Life 2007-12-03 Access to Insight ] [ July 2010 July 2010 ] [ The practice ] [ Traditional sources ] [ Anapanasati Sutta ] A traditional method given by The Buddha in the Satipatthana Sutta is to go into the forest and sit beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath, if the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short. { Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. 118, Section No. 2, translated from the Pali } { Satipatthana Sutta } While inhaling and exhaling, the meditator practises: training the mind to be sensitive to one or more of: the entire body, rapture, pleasure, the mind itself, and mental processes training the mind to be focused on one or more of: inconstancy, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment steadying, satisfying, or releasing the mind. A popular non- canonical method used today, loosely based on the Visuddhimagga, follows four stages: [ Kamalashila 2004 Meditation: The Buddhist Way of Tranquillity and Insight Windhorse Publications; 2r.e. edition Birmingham 1-899579-05-2 ] [ gaṇanā ] [ ā ] [ ā ] repeatedly counting exhalations in cycles of 10 repeatedly counting inhalations in cycles of 10 focusing on the breath without counting focusing only on the spot where the breath enters and leaves the nostrils (i.e., the nostril and upper lip area).. Regarding this list&apos;s items, the use of counting methods is not found in the Pali Canon and is attributed to the Buddhaghosa in his Visuddhimagga. According to the Visuddhimagga, counting (Pali: ) is a preliminary technique, sensitizing one to the breath&apos;s arising and ceasing, to be abandoned once one has consistent mindful connection (anubandh ) with in- and out-breaths ( Vsm VIII, 195-196). Sustained breath-counting can be soporific or cause thought proliferation (see, e.g., An layo, 2006, p. 133, n. 68). [ Modern sources ] First, for the practice to be successful, one should dedicate the practice, and set out the goal of the meditation session. { John Dunne talks on Buddhist phenomenology from the Indo-Tibetan textual point of view at http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 } One may decide to either practice ānāpānasati while seated or while walking, or to alternate seated and walking meditation. { The Three Pillars of Zen } Then one may concentrate on the breath going through one&apos;s nose: the pressure in the nostrils on each inhalation, and the feeling of the breath moving along the upper lip on each exhalation. Other times practitioners are advised to attend to the breath at the tanden, a point slightly below the navel and beneath the surface of the body. { &quot; The Three Pillars of Zen &quot; edited by } { Philip Kapleau } Practitioners may choose to count each inhalation, &quot; 1, 2, 3,... &quot; and so on, up to 10, and then begin from 1 again. Alternatively people sometimes count the exhalation, &quot; 1, 2, 3,..., &quot; on both the inhalation and exhalation. If the count is lost then one should start again from the beginning. The type of practice recommended in The Three Pillars of Zen is for one to count &quot; 1, 2, 3,... &quot; on the inhalation for a while, then to eventually switch to counting on the exhalation, then eventually, once one has more consistent success in keeping track of the count, to begin to pay attention to the breath without counting. There are practitioners who count the breath all their lives as well. { &quot; Zen Training: Methods and Philosophy &quot; by Katsuki Sekida } Beginning students are often advised to keep a brief daily practice of around 10 or 15 minutes a day. Also, a teacher or guide of some sort is often considered to be essential in Buddhist practice, as well as the sangha, or community of Buddhists, for support. When one becomes distracted from the breath, which happens to both beginning and adept practitioners, either by a thought or something else, then one simply returns their attention back to the breath. Philippe Goldin has said that important &quot; learning &quot; occurs at the moment when practitioners turn their attention back to the object of focus, the breath. { Philippe Goldin in Cognitive Neuroscience of Mindfulness Meditation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6Q0G1iHBI } [ Active breathing, passive breathing ] [ Pranayama ] Anapanasati is most commonly practiced with attention centered on the breath, without any effort to change the breathing. In the throat singing prevalent amongst the Buddhist monks of Tibet and Mongolia { The One Voice Chord } the long and slow outbreath during chanting is the core of the practice. The sound of the chant also serves to focus the mind in one-pointed concentration samadhi, while the sense of self dissolves as awareness becomes absorbed into a realm of pure sound. In some Japanese Zen meditation, the emphasis is upon maintaining &quot; strength in the abdominal area &quot; { Tanden: Source of Spiritual Strength } ( dantian or &quot; tanden &quot; ) and slow deep breathing during the long outbreath, again to assist the attainment of a mental state of one-pointed concentration. There is also a &quot; bamboo method, &quot; during which time one inhales and exhales in punctuated bits, as if running one&apos;s hand along the stalk of a bamboo tree. Pranayama, or Yogic breath control, is very popular in traditional and modern forms of Yoga. [ Scientifically demonstrated benefits ] [ Research on meditation ] The practice of focusing one&apos;s attention changes the brain in ways to improve that ability over time; the brain grows in response to meditation. { http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2693206/ Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation by Antoine Lutz, Heleen A. Slagter, John D. Dunne, and Richard J. Davidson at University of Wisconsin } Meditation can be thought of as mental training, similar to learning to ride a bike or play a piano. Meditators experienced in focused attention meditation (anapanasati is a type of focused attention meditation) showed a decrease in habitual responding a 20-minute Stroop test, which, as suggested by Davidson and colleagues, may illustrate a lessening of emotionally reactive and automatic responding behavior. It has been scientifically demonstrated that ānāpānasati slows down the natural aging process of the brain. { &quot; Long-term meditation fights age-related cognitive decline &quot; at Mempowered!, August 2011 } [ Stages of Ānāpānasati ] Formally, there are sixteen stages – or contemplations – of ānāpānasati. These are divided into four tetrads (i.e., sets or groups of four). The first four steps involve focusing the mind on breathing, which is the &apos;body-conditioner&apos; ( Pali : kāya-sankhāra). The second tetrad involves focusing on the feelings (vedanā), which are the &apos;mind-conditioner&apos; ( Pali : citta-sankhāra). The third tetrad involves focusing on the mind itself ( Pali : citta), and the fourth on &apos;mental qualities&apos; ( Pali : dhamma ). (Compare right mindfulness and satipatthana.) Any ānāpānasati meditation session should progress through the stages in order, beginning at the first, whether the practitioner has performed all stages in a previous session or not.

Contemplating relinquishment [ In the Theravada tradition ] According to several teachers in Theravada Buddhism, anapanasati alone will lead to the removal of all one&apos;s defilements ( kilesa ) and eventually to enlightenment. Anapanasati can also be practised with other traditional meditation subjects including the four frames of reference In regards to practicing anapanasati in tandem with other frames of reference ( satipatthana ), Thanissaro (2000) writes: At first glance, the four frames of reference for satipatthana practice sound like four different meditation exercises, but MN 118 [the Anapanasati Sutta] makes clear that they can all center on a single practice: keeping the breath in mind. When the mind is with the breath, all four frames of reference are right there. The difference lies simply in the subtlety of one&apos;s focus.... [A] s a meditator get more skilled in staying with the breath, the practice of satipatthana gives greater sensitivity in peeling away ever more subtle layers of participation in the present moment until nothing is left standing in the way of total release. and mettā bhāvanā, { According to Kamalashila (2004), one practices anapanasati with mettā bhāvanā in order to prevent withdrawal from the world and the loss of compassion. } as is done in modern Theravadan Buddhism. [ In the Chinese tradition ] Buddhacinga, a monk who came to China and widely propagated ānāpānasmṛti methods. In the 2nd century CE, the Buddhist monk An Shigao came from Northwest India to China and became one of the first translators of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. He translated a version of the Ānāpānasmṛti Sūtra between 148 CE and 170 CE. This version is a significantly longer text than what appears in the Ekottara Āgama, and is entitled, &quot; The Great Ānāpānasmṛti Sūtra &quot; (Ch. 大安般守意經) ( Taishō Tripiṭaka 602). At a later date, Buddhacinga, more commonly known as Fotudeng (佛圖澄) (231-349 CE), came from Central Asia to China in 310 CE and propagated Buddhism widely. He is said to have demonstrated many spiritual powers, and was able to convert the warlords in this region of China over to Buddhism. { Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. pp. 80-81 } He is well known for teaching methods of meditation, and especially ānāpānasmṛti. Fotudeng widely taught ānāpānasmṛti through methods of counting breaths, so as to temper to the breathing, simultaneously focusing the mind into a state of peaceful meditative concentration. { Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. p. 81 } By teaching meditation methods as well as doctrine, Fotudeng popularized Buddhism quickly. According to Nan Huaijin, &quot; Besides all its theoretical accounts of emptiness and existence, Buddhism also offered methods for genuine realization of spiritual powers and meditative concentration that could be relied upon. This is the reason that Buddhism began to develop so vigorously in China with Fotudeng. &quot; As more monks such as Kumārajīva, Dharmanandi, Gautama Saṃghadeva, and Buddhabhadra came to the East, translations of meditation texts did as well, which often taught various methods of ānāpānasmṛti that were being used in India. These became integrated in various Buddhist traditions, as well as into non-Buddhist traditions such as Daoism. In the 6th century CE, the Tiantai school was formed, teaching the One Vehicle (Skt. Ekayāna ), the vehicle of attaining Buddhahood, as the main principle, and three forms of śamatha - vipaśyanā correlated with the meditative perspectives of emptiness, provisional existence, and the mean, as the method of cultivating realization. { Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. p. 91 } The Tiantai school places emphasis on ānāpānasmṛti in accordance with the principles of śamatha and vipaśyanā. In China, the Tiantai understanding of meditation has had the reputation of being the most systematic and comprehensive of all. { Luk, Charles. The Secrets of Chinese Meditation. 1964. p. 110 } The founder of the Tiantai school, Śramaṇa Zhiyi, wrote many commentaries and treatises on meditation. Of these texts, Zhiyi&apos;s Concise Śamatha-vipaśyanā (小止観 Xiǎo Zhǐguān), his Mahā-śamatha-vipaśyanā (摩訶止観 Móhē Zhǐguān), and his Six Subtle Dharma Gates (六妙法門 Liù Miào Fǎmén) are the most widely read in China. Zhiyi classifies breathing into four main categories: panting (喘 &quot; chuǎn &quot; ), unhurried breathing (風 &quot; fēng &quot; ), deep and quiet breathing (氣 &quot; qì &quot; ), and stillness or rest (息 &quot; xi &quot; ). Zhiyi holds that the first three kinds of breathing are incorrect, while the fourth is correct, and that the breathing should reach stillness and rest. { Luk, Charles. The Secrets of Chinese Meditation. 1964. p. 125 } Venerable Hsuan Hua, who taught Chán/Zen and Pure Land Buddhism, also taught that the external breathing reaches a state of stillness in correct meditation: { Hsuan Hua. The Chan Handbook. 2004. p. 44 } [ A practitioner with sufficient skill does not breathe externally. That external breathing has stopped, but the internal breathing functions. With internal breathing there is no exhalation through the nose or mouth, but all pores on the body are breathing. A person who is breathing internally appears to be dead, but actually he has not died. He does not breathe externally, but the internal breathing has come alive. ] [ In the Indo-Tibetan tradition ] In the Tibetan Buddhist lineage, anapanasati is done to calm the mind in order to prepare one for various other practices. Two of the most important Mahāyāna philosophers, Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, in the Śrāvakabhūmi chapter of the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra and the Abhidharma-kośa, respectively, make it clear that they consider ānāpānasmṛti a profound practice leading to vipaśyanā (in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha in the Sutra pitika). { Study and Practice of Meditation: Tibetan Interpretations of the Concentrations and Formless Absorptions by Leah Zahler. Snow Lion Publications: 2009 pg 107-108) } However, as scholar Leah Zahler has demonstrated, &quot; the practice traditions related to Vasubandhu&apos;s or Asaṅga&apos;s presentations of breath meditation were probably not transmitted to Tibet. &quot; { Study and Practice of Meditation: Tibetan Interpretations of the Concentrations and Formless Absorptions by Leah Zahler. Snow Lion Publications: 2009 pg 108) } Asaṅga correlates the sixteen stages ānāpānasmṛti with the four smṛtyupasthānas in the same way that the Ānāpānasmṛti Sutra does, but because he does not make this explicit the point was lost on later Tibetan commentators. { Zahler 119-126 } As a result, the largest Tibetan lineage, the Geluk, came to view ānāpānasmṛti as a mere preparatory practice useful for settling the mind but nothing more. { Zahler 108 } Zahler writes: The practice tradition suggested by the Treasury itself--and also by Asaṅga&apos;s Grounds of Hearers--is one in which mindfulness of breathing becomes a basis for inductive reasoning on such topics as the five aggregates; as a result of such inductive reasoning, the meditator progresses through the Hearer paths of preparation, seeing, and meditation. It seems at least possible that both Vasubandhu and Asaṅga presented their respective versions of such a method, analogous to but different from modern Theravāda insight meditation, and that Gelukpa scholars were unable to reconstruct it in the absence of a practice tradition because of the great difference between this type of inductive meditative reasoning based on observation and the types of meditative reasoning using consequences (thal &apos;gyur, prasaanga) or syllogisms (sbyor ba, prayoga) with which Gelukpas were familiar. Thus, although Gelukpa scholars give detailed intepretations of the systems of breath meditation set forth in Vasubandu&apos;s and Asaṅga&apos;s texts, they may not fully account for the higher stages of breath meditation set forth in those texts... it appears that neither the Gelukpa textbook writers nor modern scholars such as Lati Rinpoche and Gendun Lodro were in a position to conclude that the first moment of the fifth stage of Vasubandhu&apos;s system of breath meditation coincides with the attainment of special insight and that, therefore, the first four stages must be a method for cultivating special insight. { Zahler 108, 113 } Zahler continues, &quot; it appears..that a meditative tradition consisting of analysis based on observation—inductive reasoning within meditation—was not transmitted to Tibet; what Gelukpa writers call analytical meditation is syllogistic reasoning within meditation. Thus, Jamyang Shaypa fails to recognize the possibility of an &apos;analytical meditation&apos; based on observation, even when he cites passages on breath meditation from Vasubandhu&apos;s Treasury of Manifest Knowledge and, especially, Asaṅga&apos;s Grounds of Hearers that appear to describe it. &quot; { Zahler 306 } Stephen Batchelor, who for years was monk in the Gelukpa lineage, experienced this firsthand. He writes, &quot; such systematic practice of mindfulness was not preserved in the Tibetan traditions. The Gelugpa lamas know about such methods and can point to long descriptions of mindfulness in their Abhidharma works, but the living application of the practice has largely been lost. (Only in dzog-chen, with the idea of &apos;awareness&apos; [rig pa] do we find something similar.) For many Tibetans the very term &apos;mindfulness&apos; (sati in Pali, rendered in Tibetan by dran pa) has come to be understood almost exclusively as &apos;memory&apos; or &apos;recollection.&apos; &quot; { The Faith to Doubt: Glimpses of Buddhist Uncertainty. by Stephen Batchelor. Parallax PressBerkeley: 1990 pg 8 } As Batchelor noted, however, in other traditions, particularly the Kagyu and Nyingma, mindfulness based on ānāpānasmṛti practice is considered to be quite profound means of calming the mind to prepare it for the higher practices of Dzogchen and Mahamudra. For the Kagyupa, in the context of mahāmudrā, ānāpānasmṛti is thought to be the ideal way for the meditator to transition into taking the mind itself as the object of meditation and generating vipaśyanā on that basis. { Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the } { Mahamudra tradition by Dan Brown. Wisdom Publications: 2006 pg 221-34 } The prominent contemporary Kagyu/Nyingma master Chogyam Trungpa, echoing the Kagyu Mahāmudrā view, wrote, &quot; your breathing is the closest you can come to a picture of your mind. It is the portrait of your mind in some sense...The traditional recommendation in the lineage of meditators that developed in the Kagyu-Nyingma tradition is based on the idea of mixing mind and breath. &quot; { The Path is the Goal, in The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa, Vol Two. Shambhala Publications. pgs 49, 51 } The Gelukpa allow that it is possible to take the mind itself as the object of meditation, however, Zahler reports, the Gelukpa discourage it with &quot; what seems to be thinly disguised sectarian polemics against the Nyingma Great Completeness [Dzogchen] and Kagyu Great Seal [mahāmudrā] meditations. &quot; { (Zahler 131-2) } In the Pañcakrama tantric tradition ascribed to (the Vajrayana) Nagarjuna, ānāpānasmṛti counting breaths is said to be sufficient to provoke an experience of vipaśyanā (although it occurs in the context of &quot; formal tantric practice of the completion stage in highest yogatantra &quot; ). { Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra tradition by Dan Brown.
