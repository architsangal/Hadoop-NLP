He was, until his retirement in May 2007, Deputy Assistant Commissioner in London&apos;s Metropolitan Police Service and the United Kingdom&apos;s most senior openly gay police officer. { Independent newspaper: Brian Paddick: Truth, lies and happy pills, 13 April 2008 } Paddick joined the Metropolitan Police Service in 1976. Rising through the ranks, he was appointed the officer in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at Notting Hill in 1995, then returned to New Scotland Yard, first as Superintendent of the Personnel Department in 1996 and then as Chief Superintendent in 1997. In December 2000 he was appointed Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth where he worked until 2002. In the latter capacity, Paddick attracted controversy by instructing his police officers not to arrest or charge people found with cannabis so that they could focus on crimes that were affecting the quality of life in the borough to a greater extent. The situation worsened when The Mail on Sunday published a false story by Paddick&apos;s former partner that alleged, among other things, he had used cannabis and was an anarchist [ December 2010 ]. In late 2002 the Crown Prosecution Service decided that no charges would be brought against him, and in December 2003 Paddick and the Mail on Sunday settled legal proceedings brought by him, with the newspaper accepting that the story was false, apologising, and paying damages. In April 2005 Paddick took over management of Territorial Policing across all 32 London Boroughs. During the investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) into the wrongful shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell Tube station on 22 July 2005, Paddick stated that a member of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair &apos;s private office team had believed the wrong man had been targeted just six hours after the shooting. This allegation was contradicted by New Scotland Yard. On 28 March 2006, Paddick accepted a statement from the Metropolitan Police that it &quot; did not intend to imply &quot; a senior officer had misled the probe into the shooting and that &quot; any misunderstanding is regretted &quot;. However, following the disagreement, Paddick was assigned the position of group director of information management at New Scotland Yard, which he considered a &quot; non-job &quot;. He came to accept that his police career was over, and retired from the police force on 31 May 2007. On 13 November 2007 it was announced that Paddick had been selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London in the mayoral elections to be held on 1 May 2008. He came third behind Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone, with 9.8% of first preference votes. Between 16 November and 1 December 2008, Paddick was a contestant on the ITV1 reality television show I&apos;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!. He was the sixth person to be voted off the show. [ Family, early years and education ] Brian Paddick was born on 24 April 1958 in Balham in London, England, and spent his early years in Mitcham and Tooting Bec.

Rising through the ranks, he served as a response team officer, community officer, detective, and as a member of the Territorial Support Group (commonly referred to as the TSG or riot squad). Paddick was a sergeant on the front line during the 1981 Brixton riot, [ Nick Hopkins Trials and errors of controversial cop: How onslaught by critics took its toll of ambitious gay police chief http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0%2C4273%2C4376924%2C00.html The Guardian 19 March 2002 London ] an experience that shaped his attitudes about confrontational police action and strengthened his belief in community policing. { The Battle for Brixton, an April 2006 } { BBC2 documentary. } He was appointed Inspector in Fulham in 1983, Chief Inspector of the Personnel Department of New Scotland Yard in 1986, a staff officer in 1991, and Chief Inspector in Brixton in 1993. During this period, he also worked in Deptford, Lewisham, Thornton Heath (where his brother was the local vicar ) and Notting Hill while living in Sutton, Pimlico and Westminster, and for a while outside London. In 1995, Paddick became the officer in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at Notting Hill and was responsible for policing the Notting Hill Carnival. { New Scotland Yard, London } Paddick returned to New Scotland Yard, first as Superintendent of the Personnel Department in 1996 and then as Chief Superintendent in 1997. He then served as Borough Commander for Merton for two and a half years (1997 –1999), responsible for policing Wimbledon, Mitcham and Merton. After attending the Police Staff College in 2000, in December 2000 he was appointed Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth where he worked until 2002, fulfilling his ambition of becoming head of policing in Brixton. At Lambeth he had direct responsibility for 940 police officers and 230 support staff, and an annual budget of £37  million. After a stint in the Specialist Crime Directorate, which deals with serious cases such as murder, kidnap and fraud, Paddick returned to borough-based policing, overseeing the northwest London boroughs of Barnet, Brent, Camden, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Harrow, Hillingdon, and Islington between 2002 and 2003. He was also responsible for youth and community issues including Police Community Support Officer s and police volunteers across the whole of London. In November 2003 Paddick was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner, and in April 2005 he took over management of Territorial Policing across all 32 London Boroughs, with responsibility for 20,000 police officers and support staff. He was accountable for reducing &quot; volume crime &quot; in London (all offences up to and including rape in terms of seriousness) and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. He was the national lead for the police service on disability and mental health issues for a year and a half. He was also in the media spotlight as the senior Metropolitan Police Service spokesman for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales and after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Following a widely-publicised disagreement with Sir Ian Blair, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, over the wrongful shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell Tube station on 22 July 2005, Paddick was assigned the position of group director of information management, which he considered a &quot; non-job &quot;. Claiming that the Home Office had intervened for political reasons to ensure that Blair would not have to resign over the incident as it had occurred in the aftermath of 21 July 2005 London bombings, Paddick says he came to accept that his police career was over and that he would never achieve his goal of becoming a chief constable.

[ Press controversy ] In 2001, as Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, Paddick started to make postings on London web discussion forum Urban75. According to Paddick&apos;s autobiography, he had initially contacted Urban75 as part of an Internet campaign against the Brixton-based Movement For Justice By Any Means Necessary (MFJ), which was campaigning for justice after the police killing of local Derek Bennett. [ Brixton violence &apos;against racist police&apos; http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1450042.stm BBC News 21 July 2001 ] He also attacked MFJ chairman Alex Owolade who was subsequently sacked from his employment with Lambeth London Borough Council. [ Brian Paddick Line of Fire London Simon &amp; Schuster 2008 1-84737-174-4 152 ] [ March 2008 ] At around this time, the national press also began coverage of the pilot cannabis programme in Brixton where officers were instructed not to arrest or charge people who were found to be in possession of cannabis. They were instead to issue on-the-spot warnings and confiscate the drugs. Although Paddick is credited with the idea, the pilot programme was sanctioned by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Sir John Stevens. Paddick asserts that he implemented the policy because he wanted his officers to deal with cannabis quickly and informally so that they could concentrate on heroin and crack cocaine offences, and street robbery and burglary, which were affecting the quality of life in Lambeth to a greater extent. &quot; [P]olice officers said they weren&apos;t prepared any longer to drop cannabis down the drain because one of their colleagues had been arrested by internal investigators apparently for doing just that. They were going to arrest everybody they found even with the smallest amount of cannabis. I couldn&apos;t have allowed that to happen. They would have been doing nothing else. &quot; Critics accused him of being soft on drugs, and the policy became a source of public controversy and debate. The situation worsened when The Mail on Sunday published a false story by his former partner, James Renolleau, that Commander Paddick had used cannabis himself. They also highlighted his homosexuality as a matter of concern, and claimed he was an anarchist based on a comment he had made on Urban75 in January 2002. { See } [ &quot; Brian &quot; (Brian Paddick) &amp; #91;Message posted on Urban75 by Brian Paddick &amp; #93; http://www.urban75.net/vbulletin/showpost.php?p%3D8148%26amp%3Bpostcount%3D70 Urban75 12 January 2002 22 September 2007 ] In fact, he had written that &quot; the concept of anarchy has always appealed to me &quot;, but that he was &quot; not sure everyone would behave well if there were no laws and no system. &quot; [ Police chief rebuked over &apos;anarchy&apos; remark http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1866274.stm BBC News 11 March 2002 ] [ Brian Paddick Paddick: Some police officers are thugs http://www.urban75.org/paddick/mirror.html The Daily Mirror (reproduced on Urban75 ) 14 May 2002 ] Following the controversy, Paddick was transferred to an intelligence position and the allegations were investigated by the Crown Prosecution Service. His transfer led to public rallies in Lambeth in his support. The CPS decided in late 2002 that no charges would be brought. In November 2003, Paddick was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Territorial Policing. In a December 2003 out-of-court settlement, the Mail on Sunday accepted that their story was false, apologised, and paid damages. [ Newspaper pays damages to officer http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3334321.stm BBC News 19 December 2003 ] The situation did, however, encourage the British government to re-evaluate its policies with regard to drugs, and reclassifying cannabis from a class B to a class C drug was suggested. Subsequently the law was altered in February 2004. { See } { Legality of cannabis#United Kingdom. } In September 2007 Paddick commented: &quot; I always felt like a fish out of water in the police, not just on gay issues but generally. I was a very counter-cultural senior officer. I&apos;m very non-hierarchical and got into trouble for insisting on people calling me by my first name. I was trying to effect the most difficult change there is in an organisation, which is a change of culture – to try to make it more liberal, more understanding of difference. &quot; [ Jean Charles de Menezes ] After the 21 July 2005 London bombings and the subsequent police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes on 22 July 2005 at the Stockwell Tube station in London, Paddick met with Stockwell community leaders. Kate Hoey, Member of Parliament for Stockwell, had requested the meeting to help reassure local residents. Paddick was quoted by the BBC as stating, &quot; It was a very calm meeting. People were very understanding of the circumstances that these officers found themselves in. We expressed our sympathy to the family of the person who was tragically killed. It was a very measured meeting, but a very positive meeting. &quot; He would not promise that a similar tragedy would never happen again, but he stated it was not likely. [ Met&apos;s Paddick in Stockwell Visit http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4711989.stm BBC News 24 July 2005 ] In March 2006 it was revealed that Paddick had consulted libel lawyers in connection with statements issued by Scotland Yard. In verbal and written statements to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on their investigations into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, he had stated that a member of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair&apos;s private office team believed the wrong man had been targeted just six hours after the shooting. This was contrary to statements made at the time. When this allegation became public following an unauthorised disclosure, Scotland Yard issued a statement claiming that the officer alleged to have believed this [Paddick] &quot; has categorically denied this in his interview with, and statement to, the IPCC investigators &quot;. The statement continued that they &quot; were satisfied that whatever the reasons for this suggestion being made, it is simply not true &quot;. Paddick&apos;s interpretation of this statement was that it accused him of lying. [ Menezes Claim Sparks Libel Talks http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4816934.stm BBC News 17 March 2006 ] On 28 March 2006, Paddick accepted a statement from the Metropolitan Police that it &quot; did not intend to imply &quot; a senior officer had misled the probe into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said &quot; any misunderstanding is regretted &quot; and that Paddick had accepted its &quot; clarification &quot; and considered the matter closed. [ Met Police &apos;Regret&apos; Menezes Claim http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4855004.stm BBC News 28 March 2006 ] In a lengthy interview with Paddick published in The Daily Telegraph on 17 November 2007 detailing his thinking on becoming London Mayor, he made a revealing comment possibly connected with difficulties that have arisen because of the de Menezes killing: &quot; Policing is a dangerous job, we should trust the professional judgement of officers on the front line. We shouldn&apos;t prosecute them or their bosses if they decide to put their lives on the line for the public. &quot; [ Rachel Sylvester Alice Thomson Brian Paddick : &apos;Why I want to be mayor&apos; &amp; #91;print version: &apos;I know how to make Londoners feel safe&apos; &amp; #93; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml%3D%2Fnews%2F2007%2F11%2F17%2Fnpaddick117.xml The Daily Telegraph 17 November 2007 (online version updated 18 November 2007) 23 ] In addition, on 26 November 2007 in The Independent Paddick was asked if Commissioner Ian Blair should have resigned over the de Menezes case. His response was: &quot; Yes. The public allows the police to use force on the understanding that someone will be held to account if something goes wrong. An innocent man was killed by the police and in the absence of any individual officer being held to account, the person at the top should take responsibility. &quot; [ Brian Paddick: You ask the questions http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3196273.ece The Independent 26 November 2007 London 26 April 2010 ] [ Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London election 2008 ] Paddick speaking in City Hall after the results of the London mayoral election had been announced, 3 May 2008 In August 2006 it was reported by The Observer &apos;s &quot; Pendennis &quot; column that Paddick was considering seeking selection as the Liberal Democrats &apos; candidate for Mayor of London in the mayoral elections to be held in 2008.

We really feel, my husband and I, that we are really equal because we are married. &quot; [ Equal Marriage debate at Lib Dem conference http://www.libdemvoice.org/podcast-equal-marriage-debate-21259.html ] {. } [ Notes ] [ 2 ] [ References ] [ Dodd Vikram The Guardian Profile: Brian Paddick http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0%2C%2C1095211%2C00.html The Guardian 28 November 2003 London ] [ Brian Paddick&apos;s CV http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C%2C2066404%2C00.html The Guardian 27 April 2006 London 26 April 2010 ] [ About Brian http://www.brianpaddick4london.net/mayor/ BrianPaddick4London 9 September 2007 22 September 2007 ] [ Further reading ] [ August 2010 ] [ 2 ] [ News reports ] [ Hopkins Nick Met to try a softer line on cannabis http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0%2C%2C464228%2C00.html The Guardian 28 March 2001 London ] [ Hopkins Nick Police face the truth about cannabis: The Scotland Yard Chief who wants new terms of engagement in the war against drugs speaks for many colleagues http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0%2C%2C464568%2C00.html The Guardian 28 March 2001 London ] [ Hopkins Nick Yard relaxes approach to cannabis offences http://society.guardian.co.uk/crimeandpunishment/story/0%2C%2C507385%2C00.html The Guardian 15 June 2001 London ] [ Met begins new drugs scheme http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0%2C%2C515812%2C00.html The Guardian 2 July 2001 London 26 April 2010 ] [ Travis Alan Decriminalisation is far from Lambeth http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0%2C%2C515831%2C00.html The Guardian 21 July 2001 London ] [ Hopkins Nick Offbeat copper: Brian Paddick is on the front line in the war against guns and drugs.
