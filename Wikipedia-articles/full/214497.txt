Cataño is spread over 7 wards and Cataño Pueblo (The downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. [ History ] Hernando de Cataño was chosen to offer his medical services in Puerto Rico during Francisco Bahamonde de Lugo&apos;s tenure as Governor of Puerto Rico (1564–1568). He was one of the first physicians that arrived at Puerto Rico during its colonization and, upon accepting his position, received as payment a piece of land across the San Juan islet. From that time, the region started to be recognized by the name of its original owner. As people started establishing in the area, Cataño was declared as a barrio of Bayamón. However, there wasn&apos;t much success in the town&apos;s development during this years due to its swamp -like terrain. Still, around 1690, a hermitage was established to allow residents to receive religious services without having to travel to Bayamón. In the middle of the 19th century, a transport company was founded to facilitate the transportation of merchandise and passengers through the San Juan Bay. This spurted a growth in the population of Cataño, transforming it into one of the most prosperous barrios of Bayamón. Still, attempts to separate themselves from Bayamón on 1839 were unsuccessful. On June 26, 1893, Bishop Antonio Puig y Montserrat separated the barrios of Cataño, Palo Seco, and Palmas from Bayamón&apos;s parish and established an independent parish for the residents of these sectors. In 1927, Cataño was officially declared a municipality with the name &quot; Hato de Palmas de Cataño &quot;, which was simply shortened to Cataño. Politics also played a crucial part in the foundation of the town, since Bayamón was controlled by an administration with opposing ideologies to those of the island&apos;s Legislature. The separation of Cataño from Bayamón was a strategy to weaken that opposition. With only five square miles of territory (12.5 km 2 ), Cataño is the smallest municipality in Puerto Rico. It is less than half the size of Hormigueros, the next-smallest in area. [ Symbols ] [ Flag ] The flag consists of nine horizontal stripes: four blue stripes and five white stripes (substituting for the silver color on the coat of arms). A white and green band traverses diagonally the drape in all its extension, from the upper hoist to the lower fly. The green color represents the palm tree s that are also present in the coat of arms. The flag was officially adopted during José Alvarez Brunet tenure as mayor on September 5, 1974. [ Coat of Arms ] The Coat Of Arms of Cataño consists of the same nine horizontal stripes of same the width: four blue and five silver. The colors of the coat and the flag represent the coat of arms of the family of Don Hernando de Cataño, an Hidalgo to whom the town owes its name. The color silver represents nobility and the color blue was used by hidalgo s on their armories. It symbolizes royalty and serenity. On top of the coat of arms, there&apos;s a crown with three towers distinct of others coat of arms. The coat itself is surrounded by two green palm tree s, an allusion to one of the original names of the town: Hato de las Palmas de Cataño. [ Name ] Aside of its name, derived from its original owner, Cataño has several nicknames. The city is known as &quot; La Antesala de la Capital &quot; (the Foyer of the Capital) because of its location across the bay from the capital of Puerto Rico, the city of San Juan. [ Geography ] Cataño consists mostly of flat plains that belong to the Northern region of Puerto Rico. Its northern shore falls on the San Juan Bay of the Atlantic Ocean.

The statue Columbus by Tsereteli was designed by artist Zurab Tsereteli and would measure [ 350 ft m ] when erected. Tsereteli had offered the statue to the United States as a gift in 1992 with the intention to use it for the celebrations of the 500th year of its voyage. However, the United States rejected it. The transportation of the statue from Russia to Cataño cost $2.4 million. After arriving at the island, the 2,700 bronze pieces of the statue were scattered in a terrain awaiting for funds for the project, but Rivera Sierra was unable to garner enough public support and funding for it.
