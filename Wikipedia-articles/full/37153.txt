Early supercomputer architectures pioneered by Seymour Cray relied on compact innovative designs and local parallelism to achieve superior computational peak performance. However, in time the demand for increased computational power ushered in the age of massively parallel systems. While the supercomputers of the 1970s used only a few processors, in the 1990s, machines with thousands of processors began to appear and by the end of the 20th century, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of &quot; off-the-shelf &quot; processors were the norm. Supercomputers of the 21st century can use over 100,000 processors (some being graphic units ) connected by fast connections. Throughout the decades, the management of heat density has remained a key issue for most centralized supercomputers. { The TianHe-1A Supercomputer: Its Hardware and Software by Xue-Jun Yang, Xiang-Ke Liao, et al in the Journal of Computer Science and Technology, Volume 26, Number 3, pages 344-351 } { The Supermen: Story of Seymour Cray and the Technical Wizards Behind the Supercomputer by Charles J.

In another approach, a large number of processors are used in close proximity to each other, e.g. in a computer cluster. In such a centralized massively parallel system the speed and flexibility of the interconnect becomes very important and modern supercomputers have used various approaches ranging from enhanced Infiniband systems to three-dimensional torus interconnect s. { Knight, Will: &quot; IBM creates world&apos;s most powerful computer &quot;, NewScientist.com news service, June 2007 } { N. R. Agida et al. 2005 Blue Gene/L Torus Interconnection Network, IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol 45, No 2/3 March–May 2005 page 265 } The use of multi-core processor s combined with centralization is an emerging direction, e.g. as in the Cyclops64 system. As the price/performance of general purpose graphic processors (GPGPUs) has improved, a number of petaflop supercomputers such as Tianhe-I and Nebulae have started to rely on them. { Prickett, Timothy Top 500 supers – The Dawning of the GPUs The Register May 31, 2010 } However, other systems such as the K computer continue to use conventional processors such as SPARC -based designs and the overall applicability of GPGPU s in general purpose high performance computing applications has been the subject of debate, in that while a GPGPU maybe tuned to score well on specific benchmarks its overall applicability to everyday algorithms may be limited unless significant effort is spent to tune the application towards it. { &quot; Considering GPGPU for HPC Centers: Is It Worth the Effort? &quot; by Hans Hacker et al in Facing the Multicore-Challenge: Aspects of New Paradigms and Technologies in Parallel Computing by Rainer Keller, David Kramer and Jan-Philipp Weiss 2010 ISBN 3-642-16232-0 pages 118-121 } However, GPUs are gaining ground and in 2012 the Jaguar supercomputer was transformed into Titan by replacing CPUs with GPUs. { Cray&apos;s Titan Supercomputer for ORNL Could Be World&apos;s Fastest by Damon Poeter PC Magazine, October 11, 2011 } { GPUs Will Morph ORNL&apos;s Jaguar Into 20-Petaflop Titan by Michael Feldman HPC Wire, Oct 11, 2011 } { Oak Ridge changes Jaguar&apos;s spots from CPUs to GPUs by Timothy Prickett Morgan, The Register Oct 11, 2011 } A number of &quot; special-purpose &quot; systems have been designed, dedicated to a single problem.

The Cray 2 was liquid cooled, and used a Fluorinert &quot; cooling waterfall &quot; which was forced through the modules under pressure. However, the submerged liquid cooling approach was not practical for the multi-cabinet systems based on off-the-shelf processors, and in System X a special cooling system that combined air conditioning with liquid cooling was developed in conjunction with the Liebert company. { Computational science -- ICCS 2005: 5th international conference edited by Vaidy S.

In the most common scenario, environments such as PVM and MPI for loosely connected clusters and OpenMP for tightly coordinated shared memory machines are used. Significant effort is required to optimize an algorithm for the interconnect characteristics of the machine it will be run on; the aim is to prevent any of the CPUs from wasting time waiting on data from other nodes. GPGPU s have hundreds of processor cores and are programmed using programming models such as CUDA. Software tools for distributed processing include standard APIs such as MPI and PVM, VTL, and open source -based software solutions such as Beowulf. [ Distributed supercomputing ] [ Opportunistic approaches ] [ Grid computing ] { grid computing system connecting many personal computers over the internet } Opportunistic Supercomputing is a form of networked grid computing whereby a “super virtual computer” of many loosely coupled volunteer computing machines performs very large computing tasks. Grid computing has been applied to a number of large-scale embarrassingly parallel problems that require supercomputing performance scales. However, basic grid and cloud computing approaches that rely on volunteer computing can not handle traditional supercomputing tasks such as fluid dynamic simulations. The fastest grid computing system is the distributed computing project Folding@home. F@h reported 8.1 petaflops of x86 processing power [ 2012 03 as of March 2012 ]. Of this, 5.8 petaflops are contributed by clients running on various GPUs, 1.7 petaflops come from PlayStation 3 systems, and the rest from various CPU systems. The BOINC platform hosts a number of distributed computing projects. [ 2011 05 ], BOINC recorded a processing power of over 5.5 petaflops through over 480,000 active computers on the network {.

[ Quasi-opportunistic approaches ] [ Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing ] Quasi-opportunistic Supercomputing is a form of distributed computing whereby the “super virtual computer” of a large number of networked geographically disperse computers performs huge processing power demanding computing tasks. [ Kravtsov Valentin; Carmeli, David; Dubitzky, Werner; Orda, Ariel; Schuster, Assaf; Yoshpa, Benny Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing in grids, hot topic paper (2007) http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi%3D10.1.1.135.8993 IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing IEEE 4 August 2011 ] Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing aims to provide a higher quality of service than opportunistic grid computing by achieving more control over the assignment of tasks to distributed resources and the use of intelligence about the availability and reliability of individual systems within the supercomputing network. However, quasi-opportunistic distributed execution of demanding parallel computing software in grids should be achieved through implementation of grid-wise allocation agreements, co-allocation subsystems, communication topology-aware allocation mechanisms, fault tolerant message passing libraries and data pre-conditioning. [ Performance measurement ] [ Capability vs capacity ] Supercomputers generally aim for the maximum in capability computing rather than capacity computing. Capability computing is typically thought of as using the maximum computing power to solve a single large problem in the shortest amount of time. Often a capability system is able to solve a problem of a size or complexity that no other computer can, e.g. a very complex weather simulation application. Capacity computing in contrast is typically thought of as using efficient cost-effective computing power to solve a small number of somewhat large problems or a large number of small problems, e.g. many user access requests to a database or a web site. { The Potential Impact of High-End Capability Computing on Four Illustrative Fields of Science and Engineering by Committee on the Potential Impact of High-End Computing on Illustrative Fields of Science and Engineering and National Research Council (Oct 28, 2008) ISBN 0-309-12485-9 page 9 } Architectures that lend themselves to supporting many users for routine everyday tasks may have a lot of capacity but are not typically considered supercomputers, given that they do not solve a single very complex problem. [ Performance metrics ] [ LINPACK benchmarks ] { logscale speed&apos;&apos; over 60 years } In general, the speed of supercomputers is measured and benchmarked in &quot; FLOPS &quot; (FLoating Point Operations Per Second), and not in terms of MIPS, i.e. as &quot; instructions per second &quot;, as is the case with general purpose computers. { Performance Evaluation, Prediction and Visualization of Parallel Systems by Xingfu Wu 1999 ISBN 0-7923-8462-8 pages 114-117 } These measuremens are commonly used with an SI prefix such as tera-, combined into the shorthand &quot; TFLOPS &quot; (10 12 FLOPS, pronounced teraflops), or peta-, combined into the shorthand &quot; PFLOPS &quot; (10 15 FLOPS, pronounced petaflops.) &quot; Petascale &quot; supercomputers can process one quadrillion (10 15 ) (1000 trillion) FLOPS. Exascale is computing performance in the exaflops range. An exaflop is one quintillion (10 18 ) FLOPS (one million teraflops). No single number can reflect the overall performance of a computer system, yet the goal of the Linpack benchmark is to approximate how fast the computer solves numerical problems and it is widely used in the industry.

The LINPACK benchmark typically performs LU decomposition of a large matrix. The LINPACK performance gives some indication of performance for some real-world problems, but does not necessarily match the processing requirements of many other supercomputer workloads, which for example may require more memory bandwidth, or may require better integer computing performance, or may need a high performance I/O system to achieve high levels of performance.

IBM is also constructing a 20 PFLOPs supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, named Sequoia, based on the Blue Gene architecture which is scheduled to go online in 2012. Given the current speed of progress, supercomputers are projected to reach 1 exaflops (10 18 ) (one quintillion FLOPS) in 2019. [ Patrick Thibodeau IBM breaks petaflop barrier http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/06/10/IBM_breaks_petaflop_barrier_1.html InfoWorld 2008-06-10 ] Using the Intel MIC multi-core processor architecture, which is Intel&apos;s response to GPU systems, SGI plans to achieve a 500 times increase in performance by 2018 to achieve an exaflop. { SGI, Intel plan to speed supercomputers 500 times by 2018, ComputerWorld, June 20, 2011 } Samples of MIC chips with 32 cores which combine vector processing units with standard CPU have become available. On October 11, 2011, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced they were building a 20 petaflop supercomputer, named Titan, which will become operational in 2012, the hybrid Titan system will combine AMD Opteron processors with Nvidia GeForce 600 &quot; Kepler &quot; graphic processing unit (GPU) technologies. { Cray&apos;s Titan Supercomputer for ORNL Could Be World&apos;s Fastest by Damon PoeterPC Magazine, October 11, 2011 } At about the same time Fujitsu announced that the 20 peta flop follow up system for the K computer, called the PRIMEHPC FX10 will use the same 6 dimensional torus interconnect, but still only one SPARC processor per node. { Fujitsu Unveils Post-K Supercomputer HPC Wire Nov 7 2011 } Erik P. DeBenedictis of Sandia National Laboratories theorizes that a zettaflops (10 21 ) (one sextillion FLOPS) computer is required to accomplish full weather modeling, which could cover a two week time span accurately.
