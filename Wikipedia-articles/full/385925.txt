The landmark structure has a total length of [ 3.502 mi km 3 on ] with the longest bridge spanning [ 550 ft m 1 on ]. Travelling between Newark and Jersey City, the roadway crosses the Passaic and Hackensack rivers and Kearny Point, the peninsula between them. Trucks have been prohibited from using the Pulaski Skyway since  1934 and must use U.S. Route  1/9 Truck as an alternate route. As  of  2010, the bridge handles about 67,000  crossings per day. Unpredictable traffic conditions make the Skyway one of the most unreliable roads in the United States. Designed by Sigvald Johannesson, the Pulaski Skyway opened in  1932 as the last part of the Route  1 Extension, one of the first superhighway s in the United States, to provide a connection to the Holland Tunnel. The skyway plans originally called for drawbridge s at the river crossings, but these were later changed to high-level crossings as the road was intended to be used for high-speed traffic. It was named in  1933 for General Kazimierz Pułaski, a Polish general in the American Revolutionary War. One of several major projects built during the reign of Hudson County political boss Frank Hague, its construction was a source of political and labor disputes. A total of 15  people died in relation to the construction of the skyway. A median barrier was installed on the skyway in  1956 to reduce crashes. The bridges have been listed on the federal and state registers of historic places since  2005. They have been little altered since being built and not significantly repaired since  1984. In  2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) began a rehabilitation program which it estimates will cost about $1  billion. [ Description ] The four-lane skyway carries the US  1/9 overlap. While it generally runs east–west between Newark and Jersey City, it is signed according to US  1 and US  9 which are generally north–south routes. The west end of the skyway is near where Raymond Boulevard merges with the viaduct carrying the freeway in Newark&apos;s Ironbound. The east end is just beyond Tonnele Circle, where US  1/9 exits to the surface, following Tonnele Avenue towards the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. The road becomes the four-lane Route  139 which enters the lower part of the dual-level &quot; divided highway &quot; through Bergen Hill to the Holland Tunnel approach. In addition to crossing the Hackensack and Passaic rivers, it also passes over the New Jersey Turnpike, with which it has no interchange. Under most of the skyway is other vehicular, rail, maritime, and industrial infrastructure built on landfilled wetlands that were once part of the New Jersey Meadowlands. Sources differ on inclusion of the Route  1 Extension in the Pulaski Skyway. [ Steven M.

Sloan appointed old acquaintance Fred Lavis, a consulting engineer who had worked on foreign rail lines and the Panama Canal and written four books on locating and designing rail lines, to design this Route  1 Extension. { Hart, pp. 57–73. } The Skyway portion was designed by Sigvald Johannesson. Frank Hague, mayor of Jersey City and boss of the state&apos;s political machine, directed the state to avoid the open cuts that were already common where the railroads crossed Bergen Hill, and to include an access ramp in Kearny to spur industrial development. { Hart, p.188. } Construction of the highway, which was mostly raised on embankments, and passed through Bergen Hill in a cut began in mid-1925, and large portions in Jersey City and Newark—including the &quot; covered roadway &quot; ( Route  139 ) and the embankment in eastern Newark—were opened in late  1928, about a year after the tunnel opened.

US  1/9 is elevated through eastern Newark, but the skyway (background) rises higher to clear the rivers. Lavis&apos;s design for this section across the New Jersey Meadowlands, which would be raised on concrete piers, included two drawbridges [ 35 ft m ] above the water surface, sufficient for the majority of ships to pass underneath. He resigned in  1928, believing his work was complete, but in January  1929 the War Department objected to the continued existence of the Lincoln Highway bridges once the new highway was complete. Since the Route  1 Extension was not intended for local traffic, and replacing the drawbridges with tunnels would be expensive, a compromise was worked out by late  1929 to raise the bridges to [ 135 ft m ]. The concrete jacketing of the steel was removed from the plans, since the taller bridges would be heavier; this resulted in more future maintenance. Four companies—the American Bridge Company, McClintic-Marshall Company, Phoenix Bridge Company, and Taylor-Fichter Steel Construction Company —were awarded contracts for the so-called &quot; Diagonal Highway &quot;, with construction to start in April  1930. The two river bridges, McClintic-Marshall&apos;s portion, were completed first, { Hart, p. 103. } { Hart, p. 123. } and the $21  million { Hart, p. 4. } road was opened at 8:00  a.m. on November  24,  1932, Thanksgiving Day, after an official ceremony the previous day on the Kearny ramp.

Harry Moore directed the Highway Commission on October 25, 1932 to make a formal request to the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads to charge tolls on the Diagonal Highway.

Yordan ] [ Labor issues ] The construction of the Pulaski Skyway ended up causing a dispute between Mayor of Jersey City Frank Hague, who ran a statewide political machine, and Theodore M. Brandle, a &quot; labor czar &quot; allied with Hague. Brandle and Hague had become friends through Hague&apos;s efforts to get the approval of unions. Brandle helped organize the Branleygran Company, a construction bond underwriter, which Hague channeled construction projects towards. During the mid-1920s redevelopment of Journal Square, Brandle&apos;s Labor National Bank, founded in June  1926, acquired a new 15-story headquarters, the Labor Bank Building. Essentially Brandle controlled any construction projects in northern New Jersey, and any strikes he might call would be backed by Hague&apos;s police. { Hart, pp. 87–92. } The relationship between Hague and Brandle started to go bad in  late  1931, during the construction of the Jersey City Medical Center, an important project to Hague. Leo Brennan, a contractor approved by Hague without consulting Brandle, who was building a backup power station for the hospital, refused to work with Brandle&apos;s card-file system, by which he kept track of union members and blacklisted those whom he disliked. The annoyed Brandle called a strike, but Brennan&apos;s workers refused; the police shut down the site after a brawl, but Brennan got court approval to continue. To placate Brandle, who threatened a strike that would stop all construction work on the center, Hague paid off Brennan and hired another contractor that Brandle had approved. { Hart, pp. 89, 92–95. } For the construction of the Pulaski Skyway, which began in April  1930, Hague chose four members of the National Erectors&apos; Association, an organization of &quot; open shop &quot; (anti-union) steel contractors. Performance bonds were paid in cash, bypassing Branleygran, and the companies hired the Foster Industrial and Detective Agency to guard the site against Brandle&apos;s threat to &quot; unionize this job or else &quot;. Brandle organized picket line s of loyal union men, and the two sides frequently fought in the streets or in the work area. Brandle&apos;s sole victory was a five-day stoppage in July  1931 by 165  non-union workers, who were interested in higher pay and afraid of the ongoing fights, but decided against joining the union. { Hart, pp. 101–113. } During the LaFollette Civil Liberties Committee hearings, it was discovered that, in order to save about $50,000 in salary, the American Bridge Company, one of the four contractors, spent almost $300,000 on keeping its &quot; open shop &quot;. { Hart, pp. 151–153. } The first casualty of the labor battle was a picketer, shot and temporarily paralyzed by a perimeter guard on November  14,  1931 for throwing stones at workers. Several months later, on February  27,  1932, a car carrying six workers to the construction site was surrounded by union men, who began to beat them with iron bars. One of the workers, William T. Harrison, was dead by the next morning; Hague broke all ties with Brandle and ordered the police to &quot; wage relentless war against the Brandle gang-rioters &quot;. In April  1932, 21  ironworkers were indicted as suspects in the Harrison murder. { Hart, pp. 116–121. } The trial was held on December  6,  1932, two weeks after the completion of the skyway. Every defendant was found not guilty, since county prosecutor John Drewen was unable to place any of them at the scene of the crime, and witnesses and defendants testified that they had been forced under torture or the threat of prosecution to sign affidavit s and confessions. { Hart, pp. 137–143. } In addition to the death of William T. Harrison, 14  lives were claimed by work-related accidents during construction. { Hart, p. 112. } Hague refused to allow Brandle and the unions to win, and began to force unions to foreclose through his control of the courts. On the public side, Hague attacked the &quot; labor racketeers &quot; with words, and the local newspapers gladly went along. In  1937  and  1938, Hague turned Jersey City into a police state to fight the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which was trying to inform workers of their rights under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act. Socialist Norman Thomas was prevented from speaking in Jersey City and Newark by Hague and his friends. { Hart, pp. 143–151. } This and other similar cases turned the national spotlight on Hague, and he was attacked by the New Yorker and Life in  early  1938. Finally, in  1947, Governor Alfred E. Driscoll cut off Hague&apos;s judicial power, and the mayor retired. { Hart, pp. 169–172, 175–176. } [ Truck and other safety issues ] { Kearny ramp, which was built to promote industrial development but proved too dangerous for trucks } The slippery concrete surfacing, steep left-side ramps, center breakdown lane, and wide-open alignment built for high speeds all contributed to a high number of crashes. Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City passed an ordinance in November  1933 banning trucks from its section of the skyway, which effectively banned them from the whole road.

The matter was also taken to court, with one of the truck drivers convicted arguing that the ban was an unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce, and that since the federal government contributed money towards the road, Jersey City lacked the power to ban trucks. On August  14, Justice Thomas W. Trenchard of the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the ban, stating that &quot; the court is not at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the municipality&apos;s as to the best and most feasible manner of curing traffic evils and traffic congestion where such regulation bears a direct relationship to public safety and is reasonable and not arbitrary. &quot; [ http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res%3DFA0711FA385D167A93C7A81783D85F408385F9 Skyway Truck Ban Upheld in Jersey The New York Times August 15, 1934 7 September 25, 2010 ] The Tonnele Circle Viaduct, a new offramp allowing trucks from the Holland Tunnel to bypass Tonnele Circle, opened in September  1938.
