Shortly afterwards, a Boeing 707, chartered from British Caledonian, joined the airline&apos;s fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three Douglas DC-10 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its long haul routes. For over two decades, the DC–10–30s were Biman&apos;s sole widebody aircraft and served the airline consistently well, with no noteworthy mechanical problems – in marked contrast to the record of its domestic operations.

Two new Airbus A310s joined Biman&apos;s fleet in 1996 followed by one more in 2000.
