The 10 platforms are built on two levels beneath the Odakyu department store; 3 express service tracks (6 platforms) on the ground level and 2 tracks (4 platforms) on the level below. Each track has platforms on both sides in order to completely separate boarding and alighting passengers.

[ Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal ] [ Daily entries/exits ] The average number of entries and exits per day for the various companies operating at Shinjuku Station is 3,398,006 people. This is the most of any station in the world. The figures below are the official number of passengers entering and exiting each day released by each train operator. In these figures, passengers who transfer between lines of different operators are counted twice, but conversely, passengers who change between trains of the same operator, or who change between operators whose lines are not separated by barriers (such as between Keio and Toei subway), will not be counted at all.

Shinjuku was still a quiet community at the time and the station was not heavily trafficked at first. The opening of the Chūō Line (1889), Keiō Line (1915) and Odakyū Line (1923) led to increasing traffic through the station. Subway service began in 1959. In August 1967, a freight train carrying jet fuel bound for the U.S. air base in Tachikawa derailed and caught fire on the Chūō Rapid tracks. The station was a major site for student protests in 1968 and 1969, the height of civil unrest in postwar Japan. On October 21, 1968, 290,000 marchers participated in International Anti-War Day taking over Shinjuku station and forcing trains to stop. There have been plans at various points in history to connect Shinjuku into the Shinkansen network, and the 1973 Shinkansen Basic Plan, still in force, specifies that the station should be the southern terminus of the Jōetsu Shinkansen line to Niigata. While construction of the Ōmiya -Shinjuku link never started and the Jōetsu line presently terminates in Tokyo Station, the right of way, including an area underneath the station, remains reserved. On May 5, 1995, the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult attempted a chemical terrorist attack by setting off a cyanide gas device in a toilet in the underground concourse, barely a month after the gas attack on the Tokyo subway which killed 12 and injured thousands. This time the attack was thwarted by staff who extinguished the burning device. [ Keiō Shinjuku Station ] Keiō Shinjuku Oiwake Building, the site of the former terminal When the Keiō Line extended to Shinjuku in 1915, its terminal was located several blocks east of the government railway (presently JR) station. The terminal was first named [ Shinjuku-Oiwake Station 新宿追分駅 ] and was on the street near the Isetan department store. In 1927, the station was moved from the street to a newly-built terminal adjacent to the original station. The station building housed a department store. The station name was changed to [ Yotsuya-Shinjuku Station 四谷新宿駅 ] in 1930 and again to [ Keiō Shinjuku Station 京王新宿駅 ] in 1937. The tracks from the terminal were on the Kōshū Kaidō highway, which crosses the Yamanote Line and the Chūō Line in front of the south entrance of Shinjuku Station by a bridge. The Keiō Line had a station for the access to Shinjuku Station, named [ Teishajō-mae Station 停車場前駅 ] and renamed in 1937 [ Shōsen Shinjuku Ekimae Station 省線新宿駅前駅 ]. In July 1945, the terminal of the Keiō Line was relocated to the present location, though on the ground level, on the west side of Shinjuku Station. Keiō Shinjuku Station and Shōsen Shinjuku Ekimae Station were closed. This was because the trains faced difficulty in climbing up the slopes of the bridge over the governmental railway after one of the nearby transformer substations was destroyed by an air raid. The site of Keiō Shinjuku Station near Shinjuku-Sanchōme subway station is now occupied by two buildings owned by Keiō: Keiō Shinjuku Sanchōme Building and Keiō Shinjuku Oiwake Building.
