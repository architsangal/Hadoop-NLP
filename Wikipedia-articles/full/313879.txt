Britannica Encyclopedia Online } The [ 128 km mi on ] march was characterized by wide-ranging physical abuse and murder, and resulted in very high fatalities inflicted upon prisoners and civilians alike by the Japanese Army, and was later judged by an Allied military commission to be a Japanese war crime. { Stanley L. Falk, Bataan: The March of Death (NY: Norton, 1962). } [ The march of death ] The Japanese were unprepared for the number of prisoners that they were responsible for, and there was no organized plan for how to handle them. Prisoners were stripped of their weapons and valuables, and told to march to Balanga, the capital of Bataan. Many were beaten, bayonetted and mistreated. The first major atrocity occurred when between 350 and 400 Filipino officers and NCOs were summarily executed after they had surrendered.

The Japanese failed to supply the prisoners with food or water until they had reached Balanga. Many of the prisoners died along the way of heat or exhaustion. Prisoners were given no food for the first three days, and were only allowed to drink water from filthy water buffalo wallows on the side of the road. At times, prisoners were made to bury their comrades alive at the side of the roads. Any refusal to do so was met with execution and further punishment to others.

Once they arrived in Balanga, the overcrowded conditions and poor hygiene caused dysentery and other diseases to rapidly spread amongst the prisoners. The Japanese failed to provide them with medical care, leaving U.S. medical personnel to tend to the sick and wounded (with few or no supplies).

(National Archives). In June 2001, U.S. Congressional Representative Dana Rohrabacher described the horrors and brutality that the prisoners experienced on the march: [ &quot; They were beaten, and they were starved as they marched. Those who fell were bayoneted. Some of those who fell were beheaded by Japanese officers who were practicing with their samurai swords from horseback. The Japanese culture at that time reflected the view that any warrior who surrendered had no honor; thus was not to be treated like a human being. Thus they were not committing crimes against human beings. [...] The Japanese soldiers at that time [...] felt they were dealing with subhumans and animals. &quot; U.S. Congressional Representative Rohrabacher, &quot; Paying Homage to a Special Group of Veterans, Survivors of Bataan and Corregidor &quot;, Congressional Record – House, V. 147, Pt. 9, June 26, 2001, p. 11980-11985, at p. 11981 ] Trucks were known to drive over some of those who fell or succumbed to fatigue, { Greenberger, Robert.

Marchers were harassed with random bayonet stabs and beatings. { {* } [ Stewart, Sidney Give Us This Day W. W.

The trains had no sanitation facilities, and disease continued to take a heavy toll of the prisoners. After they reached Capas, they were forced to walk the final 9 miles to Camp O&apos;Donnell. Even after arriving at Camp O&apos;Donnell, the survivors of the march continued to die at a rate of 30–50 per day, leading to thousands more dead. Most of the dead were buried in mass graves that the Japanese dug out with bulldozers on the outside of the barbed wire surrounding the compound.

All told, approximately 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 300–650 American prisoners of war died before they could reach Camp O&apos;Donnell. [ Public responses ] News of the Bataan Death March sparked outrage in the US, as reflected in this poster. [ Japanese ] In an attempt to counter the American propaganda value of the march, the Japanese had The Manila Times claim that the prisoners were treated humanely and their death rate had to be attributed to the intransigence of the American commanders who did not surrender until their men were on the verge of death. { John Toland, } { The Rising Sun : The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945 p 300 Random House New York 1970 } [ United States ] The Bataan Death March, and other Japanese actions, were used to arouse fury in the United States. { Jansen, Marius B.

[ May 2011 ] [ Memorials and commemorative events ] [ Memorials to Bataan Death March victims ] In many places throughout the United States, and in the Philippines, there exist dozens of memorials (such as monuments, plaques and schools) dedicated to the U.S. and Filipino prisoners who died during the Bataan Death March. A wide variety of commemorative events are held to honor the victims, including holidays, athletic events such as ultramarathons, and memorial ceremonies held at military cemeteries. The Bataan Death March had a large impact on the state of New Mexico. Eighteen Hundred New Mexico Soldiers from the 200th/515th Coast Artillery of the National Guard were deployed to the Philippines in WWII. Only half of these soldiers survived. Within a few years after the war almost one half more had died.The New Mexico National Guard Bataan Memorial Museum is located in the Armory where the soldiers of the 200th and 515th were processed before their deployment to the Philippines in 1941. Every year, in early Spring, a rigorous 26.2 mile march/run is conducted at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, in honor of the service members who defended the Philippine Islands during WWII. As of May 2012 there were 60 survivors, 31 of which reside in New Mexico. Many of these survivors were teens at the time and had lied about their ages to gain entry into the military. The oldest living survivor died at the age of 105 in 2011.
