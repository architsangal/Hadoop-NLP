A museum dedicated to his work, the Fundació Joan Miró, was established in his birth city in 1975. Earning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as Surrealism, a sandbox for the subconscious mind, a re-creation of the childlike, and a manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and famously declared an &quot; assassination of painting &quot; in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting. { M. Rowell, Joan Mirό: Selected Writings and Interviews (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1987) pp. 114–116. } [ Biography ] Born to the families of a goldsmith and a cabinet-maker, he grew up in the Barri Gòtic neighborhood of Barcelona. { Victoria Combalia, &quot; Miró&apos;s Strategies: Rebellious in Barcelona, Reticent in Paris &quot;, from Joan Miró: Snail Woman Flower Star, Prestel 2008 } His father was Miquel Miró Adzerias and his mother was Dolores Ferrà. [ Joan Miró The Arts Council Roland Penrose 1964 11 Roland Penrose ] He began drawing classes at the age of seven at a private school at Carrer del Regomir 13, a medieval mansion. In 1907 he enrolled at the fine art academy at La Llotja, to the dismay of his father. He studied at the Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc [ Joan Miró http://totallyhistory.com/joan-miro/ Totally History ] and he had his first solo show in 1918 at the Dalmau Gallery, where his work was ridiculed and defaced. { Miró images in Barcelona, The Independent, 13 April 2011, article by Maya Jaggi } Inspired by Cubist and surrealist exhibitions from abroad, Miró was drawn towards the arts community that was gathering in Montparnasse and in 1920 moved to Paris, but continued to spend his summers in Catalonia. [ Career ] { The Farm,&apos;&apos; 1921 –1922, } { National Gallery of Art, } { Washington, DC. } Miró initially went to business school as well as art school. He began his working career when he was a teenager as a clerk, although he abandoned the business world completely for art after suffering a nervous breakdown. His early art, like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists exhibited in Barcelona, was inspired by Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Cézanne. The resemblance of Miró&apos;s work to that of the intermediate generation of the avant-garde has led scholars to dub this period his Catalan Fauvist period. { Jacques Lassaigne, Miró: biographical and critical study. Tr. Stuart Gilbert. (Paris: Editions d&apos;Art Albert Skira, 1963) pp. 24-25. } A few years after Miró’s 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he finished a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents’ farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, The Farm, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce’s Ulysses and described it by saying, “It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that you feel when you are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.” { Hemingway, Ernest. &quot; The Farm. &quot; Homage to Joan Miró. Ed. G. di San Lazzaro. New York: Tudor Publishing Company, 1972. pp. 34. } Miró annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and the Tilled Field, two of Miró’s first works classified as Surrealist, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade. In 1924, Miró joined the Surrealist group. The already symbolic and poetic nature of Miró’s work, as well as the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Miró’s work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Miró referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as “x” in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. { Umland, Anne. &quot; A Challenge to Painting: Miró and Collage in the 1920s. &quot; Joan Miró. Ed. Agnes De la Beaumelle. London: Paul Holberton Publishing, 2004. pp. 61-69. } The paintings that came out of this period were eventually dubbed Miró’s dream paintings. { Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. This early painting, a complex arrangement of objects and figures, was Miró&apos;s first } { Surrealist } { masterpiece. Spector, Nancy. &quot; The Tilled Field, 1923–1924 &quot;. } { Guggenheim display caption. Retrieved on May 30, 2008. } Miró did not completely abandon subject matter. Despite the Surrealist automatic techniques that he employed extensively in the 1920s, sketches show that his work was often the result of a methodical process. Miró’s work rarely dipped into non-objectivity, maintaining a symbolic, schematic language. This was perhaps most prominent in the repeated Head of a Catalan Peasant series of 1924 to 1925. In 1926, he collaborated with Max Ernst on designs for ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev. With Miró&apos;s help, Ernst pioneered the technique of grattage, in which he troweled pigment onto his canvases. [ October 2011 ] Miró returned to a more representational form of painting with The Dutch Interiors of 1928. Crafted after works by Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh and Jan Steen seen as postcard reproductions, the paintings reveal the influence of a trip to Holland taken by the artist. { &quot; Miró: The Dutch Interiors &quot; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. } These paintings share more in common with Tilled Field or Harlequin’s Carnival than with the minimalistic dream paintings produced a few years earlier. Miró married Pilar Juncosa in Palma ( Majorca ) on October 12, 1929; their daughter Dolores was born July 17, 1931. In 1931, Pierre Matisse opened an art gallery in New York City. The Pierre Matisse Gallery (which existed until Matisse&apos;s death in 1989) became an influential part of the Modern art movement in America. From the outset Matisse represented Joan Miró and introduced his work to the United States market by frequently exhibiting Miró&apos;s work in New York. { Matisse, Father &amp; Son, by } { John Russell, published by Harry N. Abrams, NYC. Copyright John Russell 1999, pp.387-389 ISBN 0-8109-4378-6 } { Metropolitan Museum exhibition of works from the Pierre Matisse Gallery, accessed online June 20, 2007, http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Matisse/collection_more.htm } Until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Miró habitually returned to Spain in the summers. Once the war began, he was unable to return home. Unlike many of his surrealist contemporaries, Miró had previously preferred to stay away from explicitly political commentary in his work. Though a sense of nationalism pervaded his earliest surreal landscapes and Head of a Catalan Peasant, it wasn’t until Spain’s Republican government commissioned him to paint the mural, The Reaper, for the Spanish Republican Pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exhibition, that Miró’s work took on a politically charged meaning. { Robin Adele Greeley, Surrealism and the Spanish Civil War. (New Haven: Yale University press, 2006) pp. 14-22. } In 1939, with Germany’s invasion of France looming, Miró relocated to Varengeville in Normandy, and on May 20th of the following year, as Germans invaded Paris, he narrowly fled to Spain (now controlled by Francisco Franco) for the duration of the Vichy Regime’s rule. { Jacques Lassaigne, Miró: biographical and critical study. Tr. Stuart Gilbert. (Paris: Editions d&apos;Art Albert Skira, 1963) pp. 5-8. } In Varengeville, Palma, and Mont-roig, between 1940 and 1941, Miró created the twenty-three gouache series Constellations. Revolving around celestial symbolism, Constellations earned the artist praise from André Breton, who seventeen years later wrote a series of poems, named after and inspired by Miró&apos;s series. { Renee Riese Hubert, Miró and Breton. Yale French Studies, No. 31, Surrealism (1964). pp. 52-59. } Features of this work revealed a shifting focus to the subjects of women, birds, and the moon, which would dominate his iconography for much of the rest of his career. { Blue II, and Blue III,&apos;&apos; 1961, triptych in October 2010, } { Centre Pompidou-Metz museum, } { Metz, } { France. } [ Charlotte Higgins, chief arts writer http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/apr/11/joan-miro-retrospective-reunites-triptychs Guardian, April, 2011, &apos; &amp; #39;Joan Miró Retrospective Reunites Triptychs Guardian 2012-03-15 ] Shuzo Takiguchi published the first monograph on Miró in 1940. In 1948–49 Miró lived in Barcelona and made frequent visits to Paris to work on printing techniques at the Mourlot Studios and the Atelier Lacourière. He developed a close relationship with Fernand Mourlot and that resulted in the production of over one thousand different lithographic editions. In 1959, André Breton asked Miró to represent Spain in The Homage to Surrealism exhibition alongside Enrique Tábara, Salvador Dalí, and Eugenio Granell. Miró created a series of sculptures and ceramics for the garden of the Maeght Foundation in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, which was completed in 1964. In 1974, Miró created a tapestry for the World Trade Center in New York City. He had initially refused to do a tapestry, then he learned the craft and produced several. His World Trade Center Tapestry was displayed for many years at the World Trade Center building. { Saul Wenegrat: September 11th: ART LOSS, DAMAGE, AND REPERCUSSIONS, Proceedings of an IFAR Symposium on February 28, 2002.

This large, mixed media sculpture is situated outdoors in the downtown Loop area of Chicago, across the street from another large public sculpture, the Chicago Picasso. Miró had created a bronze model of The Sun, the Moon and One Star in 1967. The maquette now resides in the Milwaukee Art Museum. [ Late life and death ] In 1979 Miró received a doctorate honoris causa from the University of Barcelona. Miró, who suffered from heart disease, [ Joan Miró dies in Spain at 90 December 26 1983 New York Times 41 ] died in his home in Palma ( Majorca ) on December 25, 1983.

These works show the influence of Cézanne, and fill the canvas with a colorful surface and a more painterly treatment than the hard-edge style of most of his later works. In Nord-Sud, the literary newspaper of that name appears in the still life, a compositional device common in cubist compositions, but also a reference to the literary and avant-garde interests of the painter. { Stephan von Wiese Painting as Universal Poetry - the connection of painting and word in Miró. In Joan Miró - Snail Woman Flower Star Prestel, 2006 } [ Magical Realism ] Starting in 1920, Miró developed a very precise style, picking out every element in isolation and detail and arranging them in deliberate composition. These works, including House with Palm tree (1918), Nude with a Mirror (1919), and The Table - Still Life with Rabbit (1920), show the clear influence of Cubism, although in a restrained way, being applied to only a proportion of the subject. For example, The Farmers Wife (1922 –23), is realistic, but some are stylized or deformed, such as the treatment of the woman&apos;s feet, which are enlarged and flattened. { Christa Lichtenstein From the Playful to a Denunciation of Violence: Miró&apos;s deformations of the 1920s and 1930s. In Joan Miró - Snail Woman Flower Star Prestel, 2006 } The culmination of this style was The Farm (1921 –22). The rural Catalan scene it depicts is augmented by an avant-guarde French newspaper in the center, showing Miró sees this work transformed by the Modernist theories he had been exposed to in Paris. The concentration on each element as equally important was a key step towards generating a pictorial sign for each element. The background is rendered in flat or patterned in simple areas, highlighting the separation of figure and ground, which would become important in his mature style.Miró made many attempts to promote this work, but his surrealist colleagues found it too realistic and apparently conventional, and so he soon turned to a more explicitly surrealist approach. { Victoria Combalia, Miró&apos;s Strategies - Rebellious in Barcelona, Reticent in Paris In Joan Miró - Snail Woman Flower Star Prestel, 2006 } [ Early Surrealism ] From the summer of 1923 in Mont-roig, Miró began a key set of paintings where abstracted pictorial signs, rather than the realistic representations used in The Farm, are predominant. In The Tilled Field, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and Pastoral (1923-24), these flat shapes and lines (mostly black or strongly coloured) suggest the subjects, sometimes quite crypticly. For Catalan Landscape (The Hunter), Miró represents the hunter with a combination of signs: a triangle for the head, curved lines for the moustache, angular lines for the body. So encoded is this work that at a later time Miró provided a precise explanation of the signs used. { Stephan von Wiese Painting as Universal Poety - the connection of painting and word in Miró., p. 58. In Joan Miró - Snail Woman Flower Star Prestel, 2008 } [ Surrealist Pictorial Language ] Through the mid-1920s Miró developed the pictorial sign language which would be central throughout the rest of his career.In Harlequin&apos;s Carnival (1924-25), there is a clear continuation of the line begun with The Tilled Field. But in subsequent works, such as The Happiness of Loving My Brunette (1925) and Painting (Fratellini) (1927), there are far fewer foreground figures, and those that remain simplified. Soon after Miró also began his Spanish Dancer series of works. These simple collages, were like a conceptual counterpoint to his paintings. In Spanish Dancer (1928) he combines a cork, a feather and a hatpin onto a blank sheet of paper. { Barcelona, Spain } [ Livre d&apos;Artiste ] Miró created over 250 illustrated books. [ http://www.letubooks.com/cat_Joan_Miro_-_the_Illustrated_Books.html Joan Miro - The Illustrated Books Letubooks.com 2012-03-15 ] These were known as &quot; Livre d&apos; Artiste. &quot; One such work was published in 1974, at the urging of the widow of the French poet Robert Desnos, titled &quot; Les pénalités de l&apos;enfer ou les nouvelles Hébrides &quot; (The Penalties of Hell or The New Hebrides). It was a set of 25 lithographs, five in black, and the others in colors. In 2006 the book was displayed in “Joan Miró, Illustrated Books” at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic said it is “an especially powerful set, not only for the rich imagery but also for the story behind the book&apos;s creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature Miró&apos;s familiar shapes, there&apos;s an unusual emphasis on texture. &quot; The critic continued, “I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that&apos;s in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Miró&apos;s work. Their poignancy is even greater, I think, when you read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a livre d&apos;artiste. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish civil war and World War II. Desnos&apos; bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Auschwitz, and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945. Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos&apos; widow, Miró set out to illustrate the poet&apos;s manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration. “ { Fundació Joan Miró Museum in } { Montjuïc, } { Barcelona } { Reina Sofia Museum, } { Madrid } [ Styles and Development ] In Paris, under the influence of poets and writers, he developed his unique style: organic forms and flattened picture planes drawn with a sharp line. Generally thought of as a Surrealist because of his interest in automatism and the use of sexual symbols (for example, ovoids with wavy lines emanating from them), Miró&apos;s style was influenced in varying degrees by Surrealism and Dada, { Miró&apos;s art biography at guggenheimcollection.org } yet he rejected membership in any artistic movement in the interwar European years. André Breton described him as &quot; the most Surrealist of us all. &quot; Miró confessed to creating one of his most famous works, Harlequin&apos;s Carnival, under similar circumstances: &quot; How did I think up my drawings and my ideas for painting? Well I&apos;d come home to my Paris studio in Rue Blomet at night, I&apos;d go to bed, and sometimes I hadn&apos;t any supper. I saw things, and I jotted them down in a notebook. I saw shapes on the ceiling... &quot; Janis Mink, Miró (Los Angeles: Taschen, 2003), p. 43. Miró&apos;s surrealist origins evolved out of &quot; repression &quot; much like all Spanish surrealist and magic realist work, especially because of his Catalan ethnicity, which was subject to special persecution by the Franco regime. Also, Joan Miró was well aware of Haitian Voodoo art and Cuban Santería religion through his travels before going into exile. This led to his signature style of art making. [ October 2011 ] [ Experimental style ] Joan Miró was among the first artists to develop automatic drawing as a way to undo previous established techniques in painting, and thus, with André Masson, represented the beginning of Surrealism as an art movement. [ October 2011 ] However, Miró chose not to become an official member of the Surrealists in order to be free to experiment with other artistic styles without compromising his position within the group. He pursued his own interests in the art world, ranging from automatic drawing and surrealism, to expressionism, Lyrical Abstraction, and Color Field painting. Four-dimensional painting was a theoretical type of painting Miró proposed in which painting would transcend its two-dimensionality and even the three-dimensionality of sculpture. [ June 2008 ] Miró&apos;s oft-quoted interest in the assassination of painting is derived from a dislike of bourgeois art, which he believed was used as a way to promote propaganda and cultural identity among the wealthy. Specifically, Miró responded to Cubism in this way, which by the time of his quote had become an established art form in France. He is quoted as saying &quot; I will break their guitar, &quot; referring to Picasso&apos;s paintings, with the intent to attack the popularity and appropriation of Picasso&apos;s art by politics. [ March 2012 ] &quot; The spectacle of the sky overwhelms me. I&apos;m overwhelmed when I see, in an immense sky, the crescent of the moon, or the sun. There, in my pictures, tiny forms in huge empty spaces. Empty spaces, empty horizons, empty plains - everything which is bare has always greatly impressed me. &quot; - Joan Miró, 1958, quoted in Twentieth-Century Artists on Art. In an interview with biographer Walter Erben, Miró expressed his dislike for art critic s, saying, they &quot; are more concerned with being philosophers than anything else. They form a preconceived opinion, then they look at the work of art. Painting merely serves as a cloak in which to wrap their emaciated philosophical systems. &quot; [ June 2008 ] In the final decades of his life Miró accelerated his work in different media, producing hundreds of ceramics, including the Wall of the Moon and Wall of the Sun at the UNESCO building in Paris. He also made temporary window paintings (on glass) for an exhibit. In the last years of his life Miró wrote his most radical and least known ideas, exploring the possibilities of gas sculpture and four-dimensional painting. [ Exhibitions ] Throughout the 1960s, Miró was a featured artist in many salon shows assembled by the Maeght Foundation that also included works by Marc Chagall, Giacometti, Brach, Cesar, Ubac, and Tal-Coat. The large retrospectives devoted to Miró in his old age in towns such as New York (1972), London (1972), Saint-Paul-de-Vence (1973) and Paris (1974) were a good indication of the international acclaim that had grown steadily over the previous half-century; further major retrospectives took place posthumously. Political changes in his native country led in 1978 to the first full exhibition of his painting and graphic work, at the Museo Español de Arte Contemporáneo in Madrid. In 1993, the year of the hundredth anniversary of his birth, several exhibitions were held, among which the most prominent were those held in the Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró, Barcelona, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, and the Galerie Lelong, Paris. { Joan Miró } { Museum of Modern Art, New York. } In 2011, another retrospective was mounted by the Tate Modern, London, and travelled to Fundació Joan Miró and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.
