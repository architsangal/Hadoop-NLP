In response to this Grumman began development on a prototype twin-engine, high-wing aircraft which it designated the G-89. In 1952 the USN designated this aircraft the XS2F-1 and flew it for the first time on December 4 that year. During the rest of the 1950s three major variants emerged, the C-1 Trader being one of them. The C-1 (originally the TF-1) was outfitted to carry nine passengers or [ 3500 lb kg ] of cargo and first flew in January 1955. [ Operational history ] Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the C-1 Trader carried mail and supplies to aircraft carrier s on station in the Pacific Ocean during the Vietnam War and also served as a trainer for all-weather carrier operations. Over its production life 83 C-1 Traders were built, of which four were converted into EC-1A Tracer electronic countermeasures aircraft. The last C-1 was retired from USN service in 1988; approximately ten are still airworthy in civil hands, operated as warbird s. [ August 2010 ] In August 2010, Brazilian Naval Aviation announced that it will buy and modernize eight C-1 to served in the carrier onboard delivery (COD) and aerial refueling roles for use on its aircraft carrier &apos;&apos;São Paulo&apos;&apos;. { Brazilian navy buys Traders } [ Variants ] Grumman C-1 at Willow Grove { USS &apos;&apos;Coral Sea&apos;&apos; } TF-1 Carrier Onboard Delivery version of the S-2 Tracker with enlarged fuselage for 9 passengers, redesignated C-1A in 1962, 87 built.

This aircraft was modified with the Grumman E-1 Tracer type radome assembly (but no radar) and twin tails and served (under the designation XTF-1W) as the aerodynamic prototype for the E-1. After testing, it reverted to the transport role, (as C-1A) with radome removed but retaining the twin tails. Throughout, this aircraft retained the S-2/C-1 upward folding wings, not the E-1 wing fold which were necessitated (by the radome atop the fuselage) to fold wings back along the sides of the fuselage. http://www.theqam.org/index.html.
