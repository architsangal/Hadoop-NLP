Authorized by US Congress through 10 USC 2166 in 2001, { http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C108.txt Title 10-Armed Forces, Subtitle A-General Military Law, Part III-Training and Education, Chapter 108-Department of Defense Schools, Section. 2166. } WHINSEC &quot; Provides professional education and training to eligible personnel of nations of the Western Hemisphere within the context of the democratic principles set forth in the Charter of the Organization of American States { http://www.oas.org/dil/treaties_A-41_Charter_of_the_Organization_of_American_States.htm Charter of the OAS including members } (such charter being a treaty to which the United States is a party), while fostering mutual knowledge, transparency, confidence, and cooperation among the participating nations and promoting democratic values, respect for human rights, and knowledge and understanding of United States customs and traditions. { http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/511112e.pdf DoD Directive (DoDD) 5111.12 } Throughout the decade since its establishment, WHINSEC has provided training for more than 13,000 US and International students.

[ Background ] More Items to be posted. [ Oversight ] In 10 USC 2166, Congress establishes an independent review board (a federal advisory committee) to &quot; inquire into the curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, and academic methods of the Institute, other matters relating to the Institute that the Board decides to consider, and any other matter that the Secretary of Defense determines appropriate &quot; { http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title10/html/USCODE-2010-title10-subtitleA-partIII-chap108-sec2166.htm Government Publishing Office } The &quot; Board of Visitors &quot; (BoV) as this committee is named, is responsible for reviewing the curriculum of WHINSEC to &quot; determine whether the curriculum complies with applicable United States laws and regulations; is consistent with United States policy goals toward Latin America and the Caribbean; adheres to current United States doctrine; and appropriately emphasizes the matters specified in subsection (d)(1)- &quot; The curriculum of the Institute shall include mandatory instruction for each student, for at least 8 hours, on human rights, the rule of law, due process, civilian control of the military, and the role of the military in a democratic society. &quot; The Board must also submit an annual report to the Secretary of Defense on its findings and recommendations related to its review of the institute. Copies of their reports are posted on the Federal Advisory Committee Website { http://fido.gov/facadatabase/public.asp } The 14-member BoV includes Senator Carl Levin (Senate Armed Services Committee Majority, D-MI); Senator Saxby Chambliss (Senate Armed Services Committee Minority, R-GA); Rep. Phil Gingrey (House Armed Services Committee Majority, R-GA); Rep. Loretta Sanchez (House Armed Services Committee Minority, D-CA) as well as six members designated by the Secretary of Defense from the community at large.

By the early 1990s the Cold War was drawing to its end. During the ten years that followed, new freedoms brought new challenges. Latin America was no different, moving away from dictatorships and towards democracy, open markets, the professionalization of its military, police and interagency organizations as well as mutually beneficial cooperation with its neighbors to meet new regional challenges to security. Because USARSA&apos;s mandate and capabilities were not able to address the needs of Post Cold War Latin America and sectors of concerned citizens voiced their desire for change, Congress, through the FY01 National Defense Act, withdrew the Secretary of the Army’s authority to operate USARSA. { http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/2001NDAA.pdf } [ WHINSEC Curriculum ] [ April 2012 ] [ Opponents of WHINSEC ] [ Human rights violations by USARSA graduates ] The School of the Americas was criticized concerning the human rights violations performed by a number of its graduates, { Bay Area Protesters Sentenced in Georgia CommonDreams.org. } { Human Rights Watch, Colombia – The Ties That Bind: Colombia and Military-Paramilitary Links February 2000, Vol. 12, No. 1 (B). } { US Intelligence Oversight Board cites SOA SOA Watch, 1996. } WHINSEC argues &quot; that no school should be held accountable for the actions of its graduates. &quot; [ Center for International Policy Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation http://www.ciponline.org/facts/soa.htm May 6, 2006 ] According to the Center for International Policy, &quot; The School of the Americas had been questioned for years, as it trained many military personnel before and during the years of the &quot; national security doctrine &quot; – the dirty war years in the Southern Cone and the civil war years in Central America – in which the armed forces within several Latin American countries ruled or had disproportionate government influence and committed serious human rights violations in those countries. &quot; SOA and WHINSEC graduates continue to surface in news reports regarding both current human rights cases and new reports. Defenders argue that today the curriculum includes human rights, but according to Human Rights Watch, &quot; training alone, even when it includes human rights instruction, does not prevent human rights abuses. &quot; U.S. Army Maj. Joe Blair, a former director of instruction at the school, said, &quot; there are no substantive changes besides the name. [...] They teach the identical courses that I taught, and changed the course names and use the same manuals. &quot; [ Participation ] In 2004, Venezuela ceased all training of Venezuelan soldiers at WHINSEC [ School of the Americas Watch National Venezuela Solidarity Conference http://www.soaw.org/new/article.php?id%3D1259 May 6, 2006 ] after a long period of chilling relations between the United States and Venezuela. On March 28, 2006, the government of Argentina, headed by President Néstor Kirchner, decided to stop sending soldiers to train at WHINSEC, and the government of Uruguay affirmed that it will continue its current policy of not sending soldiers to WHINSEC.

[ School of the Americas Watch SOA/WHINSEC Grads in the News http://soaw.org/article.php?id%3D205 March 6, 2008 ] In regard to the renaming of the institution, SOA Watch claims that the approach taken by the Department of Defense is not grounded in any critical assessment of the training, procedures, performance, or results (consequences) of the training programs of the SOA. According to critics of the SOA, the name change ignores congressional concern and public outcry over the SOA&apos;s past and present link to human rights atrocities.
