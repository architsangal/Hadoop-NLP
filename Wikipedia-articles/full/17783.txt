Lesotho covers an area of around [ 30355 km2 sqmi 0 ], of which a negligible percentage is covered with water. The most notable geographic fact about Lesotho, apart from its status as an enclave, is that it is the only independent state in the world that lies entirely above [ 1000 m ft 0 ] in elevation. Its lowest point is at [ 1400 m ft 0 ], the highest lowest point of any country. Because of its elevation, the country&apos;s climate is cooler than in most other regions at the same latitude. Its climate zone can be classified as continental. [ Location ] Lesotho is a country in Southern Africa, located at around 29°30&apos; south latitude and 28°30&apos; east longitude.

Over 80% of Lesotho lies above [ 1800 m ft 0 ]. Even though very little of Lesotho is covered in water, the rivers that run across the country are an important part of Lesotho&apos;s economy. Much of the country&apos;s export income comes from water, and much of its power comes from hydroelectricity. The Orange River rises in the Drakensberg mountains in northeastern Lesotho and flows across the entire length of the country before exiting to South Africa at the Mohale&apos;s Hoek District in the southwest. The Caledon River marks the northwestern part of the border with South Africa. Other rivers include the Malibamatso, Matsoku and Senqunyane. The bedrock of Lesotho belongs to the Karoo Supergroup, consisting mostly of shale and sandstone. [ The Physical Geography of Africa W. M. Adams, A. S. Goudie, A. R.

Lesotho has a continental climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Maseru and its surrounding lowlands often reach [ 30 C F ] in the summer. [ Lesotho Profile (2006/April) Walden Publishing Ltd World of Information 2006 ] Winters can be cold with the lowlands getting down to [ -7 C F 1 ] and the highlands to [ -18 C F 1 ] at times. The yearly precipitation varies from around [ 600 mm in 1 ] in the lowland valleys to around [ 1200 mm in 1 ] in areas of the northern and eastern escarpment bordering South Africa. Most of the rain falls as summer thunderstorm s : 85% of the annual precipitation falls between the months of October and April. The winters—between May and September—are usually relatively dry. Snow is common in the deserts and low valleys between May and September; the higher peaks can experience snowfall year-round. There is much yearly variance in the amounts of rainfall, which leads to periodic drought s. [ Natural resources ] Map of Lesotho Lesotho is poor in natural resources.
