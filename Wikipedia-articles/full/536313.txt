They are easily worked, molded, and thermoformed. Because of these properties, polycarbonates find many applications. Polycarbonates do not have a unique plastic identification code and are identified as Other, 7. [ Structure ] Polycarbonates received their name because they are polymer s containing carbonate group s (–O–(C=O)–O–). Most polycarbonates of commercial interest are derived from rigid monomers. A balance of useful features including temperature resistance, impact resistance and optical properties position polycarbonates between commodity plastics and engineering plastic s. [ Production ] The main polycarbonate material is produced by the reaction of bisphenol A and phosgene [ COCl 2 ]. The overall reaction can be written as follows: 450px The first step of the synthesis involves treatment of bisphenol A with sodium hydroxide, which deprotonates the hydroxyl group s of the bisphenol A. { Volker Serini &quot; Polycarbonates &quot; in Ullmann&apos;s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. } [ 10.1002/14356007.a21_207 ] (HOC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 + 2 NaOH → (NaOC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 + 2 H 2 O The di phenoxide ((NaOC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 ) reacts with phosgene to give a chloroformate, which subsequently is attacked by another phenoxide. The net reaction from the diphenoxide is: (NaOC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 + COCl 2 → 1/n [OC(OC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 ] n + 2 NaCl In this way, approximately one billion kilograms of polycarbonate is produced annually. Many other diols have been tested in place of bisphenol A, e.g. 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane and dihydroxybenzophenone including some, e.g. tetramethylcyclobutanediol, that are unlikely endocrine disruptor s. An alternative route to polycarbonates entails transesterification from BPA and diphenyl carbonate : (HOC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 + (C 6 H 5 O) 2 CO → 1/n [OC(OC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 ] n + 2 C 6 H 5 OH The diphenyl carbonate was derived in part from carbon monoxide, this route being greener than the phosgene method. [ Properties and processing ] Polycarbonate is a very durable material. Although it has high impact-resistance, it has low scratch-resistance and so a hard coating is applied to polycarbonate eyewear lenses and polycarbonate exterior automotive components. The characteristics of polycarbonate are quite like those of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, acrylic), but polycarbonate is stronger, usable in a wider temperature range and more expensive. This polymer is highly transparent to visible light and has better light transmission characteristics than many kinds of glass. Polycarbonate has a glass transition temperature of about [ 150 C F on ], so it softens gradually above this point and flows above about [ 300 C F on ]. Tools must be held at high temperatures, generally above [ 80 C F on ] to make strain- and stress-free products. Low molecular mass grades are easier to mold than higher grades, but their strength is lower as a result. The toughest grades have the highest molecular mass, but are much more difficult to process. Unlike most thermoplastics, polycarbonate can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can be processed and formed at room temperature using sheet metal techniques, such as forming bends on a brake. Even for sharp angle bends with a tight radius, no heating is generally necessary. This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically non-conductive parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal. Note that PMMA/Plexiglas, which is similar in appearance to polycarbonate, is brittle and cannot be bent at room temperature. Main transformation techniques for polycarbonate resins: [ 0.5 - 15 mm in on ] [ 1 mm in on ] extrusion into tubes, rods and other profiles extrusion with cylinders into sheets ( ) and films (below ), which can be used directly or manufactured into other shapes using thermoforming or secondary fabrication techniques, such as bending, drilling, routing, laser cutting etc. injection molding into ready articles A bottle made from polycarbonate [ Applications ] [ Electronic components ] Polycarbonate is mainly used for electronic applications that capitalize on its collective safety features. Being a good electrical insulator and having heat resistant and flame retardant properties, it is used in various products associated with electrical and telecommunications hardware. It also serves as dielectric in high stability capacitor s. [ Construction materials ] The second largest consumer of polycarbonates is the construction industry, e.g. for domelights, flat or curved glazing, and sound wall s. [ Data storage ] A major application of polycarbonate is the production of Compact Disc s, DVD s, and Blu-ray Disc s. These discs are produced by injection molding polycarbonate into a mold cavity that has on one side a metal stamper containing a negative image of the disc data, while the other mold side is a mirrored surface. Typical products of sheet/film production include applications in advertisement (signs, displays, poster protection). [ Automotive, aircraft, and security components ] In the automotive industry, injection-molded polycarbonate can produce very smooth surfaces that make it well-suited for direct (without the need for a basecoat) metalised parts such as decorative bezels and optical reflectors. Its uniform mold shrinkage results in parts with greater accuracy than those made of polypropylene. However, due to its susceptibility to environmental stress cracking, its use is limited to low-stress applications. It can be laminated to make bullet-proof &quot; glass &quot;, although &quot; bullet-resistant &quot; is more accurate for the thinner windows, such as are used in bullet-resistant windows in automobiles. The thicker barriers of transparent plastic used in teller&apos;s windows and barriers in banks are also polycarbonate. So-called &quot; theft-proof &quot; large plastic packaging for smaller items, which cannot be opened by hand, is uniformly made from polycarbonate. The cockpit canopy of the F-22 Raptor jet fighter is made from a piece of high optical quality polycarbonate, and is the largest piece of its type formed in the world. { Egress technicians keep raptor pilots covered. Pacaf.af.mil. Retrieved on 2011-02-26. } { F-22 Cockpit. Globalsecurity.org (2008-01-21). Retrieved on 2011-02-26. } [ Niche applications ] Polycarbonate, being a versatile material with attractive processing and physical properties, has attracted myriad smaller applications. The use of injection molded drinking bottles, glasses and food containers is common, but the use of BPA and other harmful chemicals in the manufacture of polycarbonate and other plastics has stirred serious controversy (see Potential hazards in food contact applications ), leading to development and use of &quot; BPA-free &quot; plastics in various formulations. Polycarbonate is commonly used in eye protection, as well as in other projectile-resistant viewing and lighting applications that would normally indicate the use of glass, but require much higher impact-resistance. Many kinds of lenses are manufactured from polycarbonate, including automotive headlamp lenses, lighting lenses, sunglass / eyeglass lenses, swimming and SCUBA goggles, and safety glasses/goggles/visors including visors in sporting helmets/masks and police riot gear. Windscreens in small motorized vehicles are commonly made of polycarbonate, such as for motorcycles, ATVs, golf carts, and small planes and helicopters. The light weight of polycarbonate as opposed to glass has led to development of electronic display screens that replace glass with polycarbonate, for use in mobile and portable devices. Such displays include newer e-ink and some LCD screens, though CRT, plasma screen and other LCD technologies generally still require glass for its higher melting temperature and its ability to be etched in finer detail. Other miscellaneous items include durable, lightweight luggage, MP3/digital audio player cases, ocarina s, computer cases, riot shields, instrument panels, and blender jars. Many toys and hobby items are made from polycarbonate parts, e.g. fins, gyro mounts, and flybar locks for use with radio-controlled helicopter s. { Hobby Applications of Polycarbonate }. For use in applications exposed to weathering or UV-radiation, a special surface treatment is needed. This either can be a coating (e.g. for improved abrasion resistance), or a coextrusion for enhanced weathering resistance. Polycarbonate is also used as a printing substrate for nameplate and other forms of industrial grade under printed products. The polycarbonate provides a barrier to wear, the elements, and fading. [ Medical applications ] Many polycarbonate grades are used in medical applications and comply with both ISO 10993-1 and USP Class VI standards (occasionally referred to as PC-ISO). Class VI is the most stringent of the six USP ratings. These grades can be sterilized using steam at 120 °C, gamma radiation, or by the ethylene oxide (EtO) method. { Medical Applications of Polycarbonate } However, scientific research indicates possible problems with biocompatibility. Dow Chemical strictly limits all its plastics with regard to medical applications.

The basis of this controversy is their hydrolysis (degradation by water, often referred to as leaching) releases bisphenol A: 1/n [OC(OC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 ] n + H 2 O → (HOC 6 H 4 ) 2 CMe 2 + CO 2 More than 100 studies have explored the bioactivity of bisphenol A derived from polycarbonates. Bisphenol A appeared to be released from polycarbonate animal cages into water at room temperature and it may have been responsible for enlargement of the reproductive organs of female mice. [ KL Howdeshell Peterman PH, Judy BM, Taylor JA, Orazio CE, Ruhlen RL, Vom Saal FS, Welshons WV 2003 Bisphenol A is released from used polycarbonate animal cages into water at room temperature Environmental Health Perspectives 111 9 1180–7 12842771 http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/members/2003/5993/5993.html 2006-06-07 10.1289/ehp.5993 1241572 ] However, the animal cages used in the research were fabricated from industrial grade polycarbonate, rather than FDA food grade polycarbonate. An analysis of the literature on bisphenol A leachate low-dose effects by vom Saal and Hughes published in August 2005 seems to have found a suggestive correlation between the source of funding and the conclusion drawn. Industry funded studies tend to find no significant effects whereas government funded studies tend to find significant effects. [ vom Saal FS, Hughes C An extensive new literature concerning low-dose effects of bisphenol A shows the need for a new risk assessment Environ.
