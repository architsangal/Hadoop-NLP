The Green Party of England and Wales was created in 1990 when the former UK Green Party, which itself had grown out of the 1970s’ PEOPLE party, devolved into separate parties for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England and Wales. It currently has friendly relations with its Scottish and Northern Irish counterparts, and is affiliated with the Global Greens and the European Green Party. While primarily known as an environmentalist party, it has a history of support for communitarian economic policies, including well-funded, although locally controlled, public services within the confines of a steady-state economy. The party is strongly supportive of proportional representation and follows a line of euroscepticism based on its suspicion of the domination of European policy-making by corporate interests. It takes a liberal approach to social policies such as animal rights, LGBT rights and drug policy reform. The Green Party of England and Wales won its first seat in the House of Commons in the 2010 general election, following its the election of its first two MEPs in 1999.

The party gave free membership to students and people under 30 years old throughout December 2010 through to the end of January 2011 as part of their campaign against the rise in tuition fees. [ April 2011 ] [ Animal welfare, farming and food ] The Green Party is opposed to all animal experiments and believes in replacing them with non-animal alternatives. It also wants to end factory farming and badger-baiting. The party seeks to ban live export s, genetic engineering, patenting of animals, blood sport s, circus es, zoo s except for the benefit of the animals concerned, seal and fur products. However it does not oppose ritual slaughter leading to suggestions that it prioritises ethnic minority interests over other policies. &lt; /ref &gt; It proposes an end to the Common Agricultural Policy subsidisation of industrial agribusiness that in 2007 gave almost half of the UK&apos;s €6.45 bn subsidy to 10% of the biggest recipients. Instead it supports the subsidisation of local consumption and organic farming in small free range units with an eventual aim of phasing out all forms of intensive farming, including fish farms. The party is against the production and importation of genetically-modified (GM) foods. It supports Fair trade over free trade. [ Climate change ] The Green Party has a twelve-point plan to deal with climate change. It supports the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol but does not see that as anything more than a first step. It is strongly behind the &apos; Contraction and Convergence &apos; model as a method of reducing carbon emissions. Within Britain it supports tradable carbon quotas. A proportion of the quotas would be distributed on a per-head basis. The remainder would be sold to firms and organisations. The quotas would be reduced on a year-by-year basis in line with the &apos;Contraction and Convergence&apos; model. { Green Party of England and Wales Policy Website: Climate Change Section of the &apos;&apos;Manifesto for a Sustainable Society (MfSS)&apos;&apos; } [ May 2011 ] The party has set a goal of 90% carbon dioxide emissions reductions by 2050. It proposes scrapping the national roadbuilding programme and investing the estimated £30bn from the programme in green transport. It wishes to end the £9bn annual tax break to the aviation industry by 2010 and to pass the Air Traffic Emissions Reduction Bill, aiming for 50% CO2 reductions in aviation by 2050. The party is opposed to the use of nuclear energy because it believes it is too expensive and too much of security risk, and that it uses huge amounts of carbon dioxide in the extraction and production process, and is therefore an unsuitable response to climate change. [ Drugs ] The Green Party believes that the prohibition of drugs does not work. It supports the legalisation of the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. It would decriminalise small-scale possession of recreational drugs like ecstasy and gradually move towards the legalisation of all recreational drugs. It hopes that this would &quot; take the drug trade out of criminal control and place it within a regulated and controlled legal environment &quot; and cites studies that show in countries where cannabis is decriminalised, the use is much lower than in the UK. { cite= &quot; http://www.greenparty.org.uk/policies/health.html &quot; } The party has run a Green Party Drugs Group Website to promote research into ending addiction and ensuring the safe use of recreational drugs. { Green Party Drugs Group Website } [ May 2011 ] The party wants to ban advertising or sponsorship by alcohol and tobacco firms. [ Crime ] The Green Party believes that as over half of all crime is caused in some way by the misuse of Class A drugs, such as heroin or crack cocaine, that radical reform of drug laws will massively cut crime. As well as the changes highlighted in the above section on drugs, such as the legalisation of cannabis and the decriminalisation followed by legalisation of recreational drugs, they would also offer treatments for heroin and crack addicts that &quot; may include prescription of heroin &quot;. The Green Party would &quot; concentrate police and customs resources on the large-scale production, importation and marketing of these drugs &quot;. The party would also &quot; look to establish restorative justice as a key feature of the UK criminal justice system &quot;. The party would lower speed limits which &quot; will foster community and indirectly cut crime &quot;. It would have more community policing, which would be under local democratic control, and would return bus conductors who they believe &quot; have an important effect on social order &quot;. { http://www.greenparty.org.uk/policies/policies_2010/2010manifesto_everyday_life.html } [ Economy ] Like many Green parties, the Green Party of England and Wales does not consider economic growth to be the only or the best indicator of progress, as it sees endless growth as incompatible with a planet of finite resources. It is against mass consumption and the modern capitalist lifestyle of the world, it hopes to encourage an economy built on sustainability and long-term use. [ http://policy.greenparty.org.uk Green Party of England and Wales Policy Website Policy.greenparty.org.uk 2011-05-25 ] The party supports economic localisation on grounds of environmental concern, social justice and democracy, as detailed in Green Alternatives to Globalisation: A Manifesto, by Dr. Caroline Lucas, MEP, currently leader of the party and the late Dr. Mike Woodin, former Principal Speaker of the party. This includes helping local businesses through subsidies and import tariffs, &quot; democratisation &quot; of the banking system with the creation of a &quot; network of publicly owned community banks &quot;, and encouragement of informal economies in local areas. The Green Party seeks to address the &quot; poverty trap &quot; by introducing a &quot; Citizen&apos;s Income &quot; (also known as a Citizen&apos;s dividend and similar to the Basic income and Living wage ), an unconditional, non-means-tested, weekly payment made to every citizen whether they are working or not. This would replace benefits such as Job Seeker&apos;s Allowance, as well as replacing personal tax-free allowances. The party hopes that this would ensure that people can take a job and come off benefits without falling into the poverty trap, and make working part-time or becoming self-employed easier by eliminating the poverty trap. Clive Lord, a member of the Green Party of England and Wales, published A Citizen&apos;s Income, a book that sets out how to fund the Citizen&apos;s Income with an increase to the top bracket of Income Tax. Lord suggests that the Citizen&apos;s Income is a means by which to achieve prosperity within a zero-growth economy. { Lord, C., A Citizen&apos;s Income, 2003 } Green members of the London Assembly Cllr. Darren Johnson AM, and Cllr. Jenny Jones AM demonstrated their commitment to this policy in 2007 by using their casting vote over Mayor Ken Livingstone&apos;s budget to back the Living Wage Unit&apos;s campaign and increase the minimum wage for employees of the London government – then just £5.35 – to £7.45 an hour. { cite= &quot; http://www.greenparty.org.uk/policies/living-wage.html A Living Wage &quot; } On taxation, the Green Party believes in increasing the top rate of income tax to make the system more redistributive. It is in favour of a more progressive system of corporation tax to encourage small businesses over large corporations. It supports eco-taxes, such as those on packaging and carbon emissions, along the lines of the &apos;polluter pays&apos; principle. Also, the party wants an increase in trade union rights and the renationalisation of the railways and other public utilities. [ January 2010 ]. They are also saying &quot; NO &quot; to HS2.

It opposes the Euro currency on economic localisation and democracy grounds, including concerns over the unaccountability of the European Central Bank. It was also against the proposed EU constitution for similar reasons. It opposes the militarisation of the European Union and favours the disbandment of NATO to be replaced by a well-resourced Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OCSE). Other issues concerning the European Parliament that are pursued by the Green Party include mandatory disclosure and registration of all lobbying, gender equality in parliament and an end to the monthly rotation of Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg. [ http://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/EU_Manifesto_2009.pdf The Green Party Manifesto for the European Parliament elections 2009 Green party ] [ Government ] The Green Party wants &quot; to modernise and decentralise &quot; the current governmental system in England and Wales. It wants to end the place of the British Monarchy in the British constitution and replace the House of Lords with an elected second chamber. [ http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/policypointers/govt%26amp%3Bdem.pdf Government and Democracy: Politics for People PDF Green Party ] The party supports elected Regional Assemblies in England and the creation of more parish and community council s. On issues of voting, the Green Party is campaigning to introduce proportional representation (specifically the Additional Member System used in Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament elections) and reduce the voting age to 16. It is usually to be found on the civil liberties side of the &quot; liberties versus security &quot; debate, and opposes national ID cards and New Labour&apos;s anti-terror legislation. It is strongly opposed to measures like the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. [ Health ] { 2011 anti-cuts protest in London. } The Greens support reducing the influence of the major pharmaceutical industry in the National Health Service. It intends to promote health services that place as much emphasis on illness prevention, health promotion and community self-reliance as on the treatment and cure of disease, while particularly tackling the growing and preventable mental health crisis being caused by an over-competitive and market-driven culture. It wishes to make healthcare more local and introduce free eye tests and dentistry under the increased authorities of the NHS, in addition to abolishing the &quot; confused and discriminatory &quot; practice of prescription charges. It plans to increase public funding of the health service to at least the pre-2004 EU average of around 9% of GDP. [ May 2011 ] The Green Party&apos;s health policy states that health services must be &quot; effective, efficient,comprehensive, accountable &quot; and also supports the use of alternative medicine. [ http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/downloads/mfsshe.pdf Manifesto for a Sustainable Society – Health 2009 ] [ International issues ] The Green Party would increase funding to and reform the United Nations by democratising the UN Security Council and abolishing the right of veto there. The UN should publish annually a Global Index of Human Rights [ http://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/reports/ReportHRI_-4-2.pdf Global Human Rights Index=November 2008 Richard Lawson ] that would give a measurement of the Human rights performance of each country. The Green Party supports an international legal framework, both treaty-based and customary. A &quot; General Agreement on Sustainable Trade &quot;, where producers are guaranteed a reasonable price for their products before planting, and a portion of the payment is set aside for community development should replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would ban arms exports, as well as banning and attempting to mitigate lasting damage caused by military use of depleted-uranium-tipped shells. On the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the party believes in boycotting Israel until it complies with the 80 UN resolutions it is defying [ http://younggreens.greenparty.org.uk/AboutUs/Policy/InternationalIssues International Issues &amp; #124; Young Greens of England &amp; Wales Younggreens.greenparty.org.uk 2011-05-25 ] and making the EU-Israel Association Agreement conditional on an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories whilst urging Palestinians &quot; not to perpetuate the cycle of violence &quot;. Aid projects should observe the following rules: aid should be aimed at the poorest; should mobilise the poor; should be locally designed and managed; should be subject to local oversight and scrutiny; and should be specific to local communities and environments. The party opposed the Iraq War, both prior to, during, and after the US-led invasion. It has claimed that it did so &quot; on principle &quot;, criticising the Liberal Democrats for &quot; only opposing the war because no second UN Resolution was obtained &quot;. Previously, the party had opposed the Kosovo War [ http://www.greenparty.org.uk/files/reports/2004/Yugowar%20for%20website.htm Bombing of Yugoslavia 1999 February 2003 Spencer Fitz-Gibbon, Green Party Executive ] a rare stance in Britain. Although it supported &quot; self-determination &quot; for the Kosovo Albanians, it did not support independence for Kosovo, and stated that the media had ignored the crimes of the Kosovo Liberation Army. [ March 2009 ] The Green Party supports the right of asylum and &quot; seeks to change negative attitudes and stereotypes associated with refugees &quot;. The party concentrates on the causes of immigration, aiming &quot; to alleviate problems caused by war, the arms trade, environmental devastation, past colonial actions and human-rights abuses &quot;. [ Transport ] The Greens support giving priority to more sustainable methods of transport, favouring low emission and public transport over high emission, private transport. By diverting money allocated by the government to road-building schemes it would reduce dependency on the car, improving public transport to a point where it is substantially cheaper and more efficient than private motoring. New systems such as urban tram and light rail would be expanded, and all transport systems fully integrated with each other to provide comprehensive and integrated ticketing systems. Walking and cycling would be promoted as alternative means of transport by Home Zones, Safe Routes to School, pedestrianisation and mixed-use development. It would not renew private-sector train operating companies&apos; contracts and instead return railways and tube systems to public ownership, citing the strategic failure of the introduction of private competition. Higher priority would be given to railways, new lines introduced, the rail freight network expanded, land adjacent to tracks set aside for freight distribution projects, additional stations opened on existing routes, and investment allocated to new light rail systems. Where effective and appropriate, existing schemes such as road pricing and congestion pricing would be extended. A move to fuel-efficient cars would be encouraged by increasing fuel duty and abolishing the tax disc for cars. Some of the revenue raised would be used to support research and development into more sustainable forms of transport, with an emphasis on energy efficiency. With air travel predicted to reach 15% of total UK emissions by 2050, the Green Party will work towards a shift from shorter air journeys to the railways (45% of all air trips in the EU are under 500  km), resist further expansion of UK airports such as that of Heathrow and ban night flying. It would also address the absence of fuel tax and VAT on ticketing or aircraft, that is in effect a public subsidy of the industry worth around £9 billion a year (2005). [ http://www.greenparty.org.uk/files/manifesto/Manifesto%2005.pdf Manifesto &apos;05 ] [ Gay marriage ] The Green Party supports allowing same-sex couples to marry. On 22 May 2009 they called for an end to the ban on civil marriage s between same-sex couples in Britain and in other EU member states. Party leader Caroline Lucas said the party wants marriage equality for same-sex couples and that married gay couples who travel throughout Europe should be able to have their relationship recognised on the same basis as married heterosexual couples. Peter Tatchell, who was the party&apos;s candidate for Oxford East at the time, said there is a &quot; confusing patchwork &quot; of different partnership laws throughout Europe and that &quot; for a majority of lesbian and gay couples their legal rights stop at their own borders &quot;. He said, the &quot; best and most universally recognised system of partnership &quot; is civil marriage and, &quot; anything less is second class and discrimination &quot;.

Green Party conference, 2004 [ Executive ] Until September 2012, the national Green Party Executive (GPEx) consists of the following positions: [ http://www.greenparty.org.uk/people/executive.html Green Party Executive 2009–10 Green Party 14 October 2009 ] Green Party of England and Wales Executive (GPEx) Leader Caroline Lucas MP Deputy Leader Adrian Ramsay Chair Jo Steranka Campaigns Co-ordinator Matty Mitford Elections Co-ordinator Geoff Smith Equality and Diversity Co-ordinator Shan Oakes External Communications Co-ordinator Penny Kemp &amp; Tracy Dighton Finance Co-ordinator Michael Coffey Internal Communications Co-ordinator Emma Pruen International Co-ordinator John Street Local Party Support Co-ordinator Management Co-ordinator Mark Cridge Policy Co-ordinator Stuart Jeffrey Publications Co-ordinator Edward Milford Young Greens Co-ordinator Ash Haynes &amp; Sam Coates The party&apos;s Leader and Deputy Leader are elected every two years by a postal ballot of all party members. All other GPEx positions are elected annually by postal ballot or by a vote at Conference (depending on the number of candidates). To become a member of the Executive, the candidate must have been a member of the party for at least two years (or if the candidate has been a member for one complete year preceding the date of close of nominations, their nomination will be allowed if it is supported by a majority of Green Party Regional Council (GPRC) members in attendance at a quorate official GPRC meeting). The Chair is currently Jo Steranka. The 2010/11 Chair was Jayne Forbes, a former chair of the World Development Movement and Tourism Concern. The 2008/09 Chair was James Humphreys, former head of Corporate Communications at 10 Downing Street. A previous Chair, Hugo Charlton (2003 to 2005), resigned following criticism of his nomination to the House of Lords before the Party had carried out its internal selection process. { &apos;&apos;Independent on Sunday&apos;&apos; Article } [ May 2011 ] Subsequently Jenny Jones was elected to be the party&apos;s nominee in the event of the party again being asked, but this was too late for the current round. For the purposes of its registration with the Electoral Commission, the party used to designate the Chair of the Executive as the Leader of the party, until the first formal leader was elected in 2008. Members of GPEx are individually responsible for every action taken within their area of responsibility (except decisions taken collectively within GPEx itself). GPEx meets at least once every six weeks, and whenever a meeting is necessary. The Executive has the power to create whatever committees and posts &quot; it considers necessary for the efficient conduct of its business &quot;. It appoints a Panel of Speakers as spokespeople for policy areas, a Treasurer and the National Election Agent. GPEx is responsible for implementing the decisions made at Conferences, and controlling expenditure and fundraising. At the party&apos;s Autumn Conference of 2008, members elected the first Equality and Diversity Co-ordinator. At the party&apos;s Spring Conference of 2012, members voted to incorporate a Young Greens position on GPEx, to be filled by the male and female Co-Chairs of the Young Greens as a job share. The Co-Chairs of the Young Green Party of England and Wales are elected annually at their National Convention. [ Regional Council ] Oxfordshire Green Party hosting a &quot; Green Fair &quot; The Green Party Regional Council ( GPRC ) is a body that coordinates discussions between Regional Green Parties. It supports the Executive (GPEx) and is responsible for interim policy statements between Conferences and enforcing constitutional procedures. [ http://www.greenparty.org.uk Green Party Constitution (only available to party members from the Members&apos; Website or the Policy Coordinator Greenparty.org.uk 2011-05-25 ] Each Regional Green Party elects two members by postal ballot to be sent to the GPRC. These delegates&apos; terms last two years before re-election. GPRC meets at least four times a year. The Council elects male and female Co-Chairs and a Secretary. GPEx members are often required to give reports on their area of responsibility to the GPRC; the GPRC also has the power to recall any member of GPEx (by a two-thirds majority vote), who is then suspended until a re-election for the post is held; similarly, if GPEx suspends one of its own members, GPRC has the authority to decide whether that member should be reinstated or not (again, by a two-thirds majority vote). Although The Cornish Green Party (Bagas Gwer Kernewek) is an umbrella of the party itself which promotes for enhanced autonomy for the Cornish people within the UK. [ Conferences ] The Green Party of England and Wales holds a Spring and Autumn Conference every year. Conferences are governed by the Constitution and Standing Orders, and feature votes on policy and organisational matters. The Autumn Conference is the party&apos;s &quot; supreme forum &quot;, with elections to GPEx, committees and other bodies; the Conference held in the Spring, although having the same powers as the Autumn Conference on policy and organisational votes, holds elections only for vacant posts and can have its priorities decided by the preceding Autumn Conference. The conference itself is organised by Conferences Committee, but the Standing Order Committee (SOC) is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and arranging the order of business. The Green Party Conference features fringes, talks and plenary sessions. The agenda for plenary sessions is usually: Section A – Reports from various bodies within the party, including SOC, GPEx, GPRC and others Section B – Policy Voting Papers (a motion, either submitted by members or chosen by the Policy Committee, which submits a section of the Policies for a Sustainable Society for review and amendments, which are then voted on) Section C – Policy Motions (motions from members on different sections of the MfSS, but also including those which express a policy position without altering the MfSS, and Enabling Motions, which start the process of building policy on a specified area) Section D – Organisational Motions (motions from members that amend the Constitution) Policymaking within the GPEW is a long process involving consultation with various bodies and individuals. The party has released leaflets and books on how to properly amend policy. [ Constitution ] The Constitution of the Green Party of England and Wales governs all of the party&apos;s activities, from the selection of election candidates by local parties, to nominations for the House of Lords, to the conduct of GPEx and so on. The Constitution stresses &quot; openness, accountability and confidentiality &quot; in its decision-making guidelines. It can be amended only by a two-thirds majority vote at a Conference or by a two-thirds majority in a ballot of the membership. [ Status of the Wales Green Party ] [ Wales Green Party ] Unlike any other regional party within the Green Party, the Wales Green Party (WGP) (Plaid Werdd Cymru in Welsh) is a &quot; semi-autonomous regional party &quot; within the GPEW. It has greater control over its finances, and produces its own manifesto. Wales Green Party members are automatically members of the Green Party of England and Wales. Also differently from the full party, the Wales Green Party (and the North West region of England) elects a Principal Speaker who may refer to themselves as the &apos;Leader&apos; of the Wales Green Party, although, like the Green Party of England and Wales&apos;s former Principal Speakers, they have no powers of leadership. The current leader of the Wales Green Party is Pippa Bartolotti.

The Young Greens have their own Constitution, National Committee, campaigns and meetings, and have become an active presence at Green Party Conferences and election campaigns. There are now many Young Greens groups on UK university, college and higher-education institution campuses. Many Green Party Councillors are Young Greens, as are some members of GPEx and other internal party organs.

[ Groups within the Party ] Several groups are active within the party. These include groups designed to address certain areas of policy or representation, including the Green Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Group ( LGBT ), [ http://www.lgbtgreens.org.uk Green Party LGBT Group Website Lgbtgreens.org.uk 2011-05-17 2011-05-25 ] the Green Party Trades Union Group, [ http://www.gptu.net/pssess4X/3c/hpage.shtml Green Party Trades Union Group Website Gptu.net 2011-05-25 ] the Drugs Group (on drugs policy and research), The Green Economics Policy Working Group, the Monetary Reform Policy Working Group, [ http://www.sustecweb.co.uk/ Monetary Reform Policy Working Group of the Green Party of England and Wales Sustecweb.co.uk 2011-05-25 ] and others. The centrist faction known as Green 2000 sought to achieve a Green Party government by the year 2000; the group fell apart in the early 1990s. The Green Left represent some of the anti-capitalists and eco-socialists in the party who want to engage with the broader Left in the UK and attract Left-wing activists to the Green Party, [ http://www.greenleft.org.uk Green Left Website Greenleft.org.uk 2011-05-25 ] although it is a group of party members, rather than a group within the party. [ Stop Murder Music ] Along with OutRage! the Green Party have campaigned on behalf of the Stop Murder Music campaign which attempts to censor anti- homosexuality lyrics in the music of various Jamaica n dancehall artists.
