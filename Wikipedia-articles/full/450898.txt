It is [ 4 mi km 0 ] southeast of Wigan, and [ 12.6 mi km ] west of Manchester. Leigh is situated on low lying land to the north west of Chat Moss. Historically a part of Lancashire, Leigh was originally the centre of a large ecclesiastical parish covering six vill s or township s. When the three townships of Pennington, Westleigh and Bedford merged in 1875 forming the Leigh Local Board District, Leigh became the official name for the town although it had been applied to the area of Pennington and Westleigh around the parish church for many centuries.

[ Greater Manchester Gazetteer http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzi.htm gmcro 3 June 2010 ] In 1899 Leigh became a municipal borough. The first town hall was built in King Street and replaced by the present building in 1907. Originally an agricultural area noted for dairy farming, domestic spinning and weaving led to a considerable silk and, in the 20th century, cotton industry. Leigh also exploited the underlying coal measures particularly after the town was connected to the canals and railways. Leigh had an important engineering base. The legacy of Leigh&apos;s industrial past can be seen in the remaining red brick mills  – some of which are listed building s  – although it is now a mainly residential town, with Edwardian and Victorian terraced housing packed around the town centre. Leigh&apos;s present-day economy is based largely on the retail sector. [ History ] [ Toponymy ] Leigh is derived from the Old English leah which meant a place at the wood or woodland clearing, a glade and subsequently a pasture or meadow, it was spelt Legh in 1276. { Mills (1998), p. 218. } Other recorded spellings include Leech, 1264; Leeche, 1268; Leghthe, 1305; Leght, 1417; Lech, 1451; Legh, 16th century. As its name denotes it was a district rich in meadow and pasture land, and the produce of its dairies, the Leigh cheese, was formerly noted for its excellence. Westleigh, the west clearing, has been named Westeley in 1237, Westlegh in 1238 and also Westlay in Legh in 1292.

Spellings include Beneford from 1200–21 and Bedeford in 1200 and 1296.

After the Roman departure from Britain, and into the history of Anglo-Saxon England, nothing was written about Leigh. However evidence for the presence of Saxons in what was a sparsely populated and isolated part of the country is provided by local township place names that incorporate the Old English suffix leah, such as Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley. { Mills (1998), p. 405. } [ Townships ] In the 12th century the ancient parish of Leigh was made up of six townships, including Pennington, [ Pennington http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Pennington/ParishMap.shtml genuki.org.uk 9 August 2009 ] Bedford, [ Bedford http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Bedford/ParishMap.shtml genuki.org.uk 9 August 2009 ] Westleigh, [ Westleigh http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/WestLeigh/ParishMap.shtml genuki.org.uk 9 August 2009 ] Atherton, Astley, and Tyldesley cum Shakerley.

The Shuttleworths, landowners from the 14th century, were another prominent Bedford family. Richard Shuttleworth married a daughter of the Urmstons from Westleigh and brought part of the Westleigh inheritance to Bedford. This family lived at Shuttleworth House, or Sandypool Farm as it is also known, which is south of the Bridgewater Canal near to the old manor house, Bedford Hall, which survives today as a Grade II listed building. [ Bedford Hall http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id%3D213498%26amp%3B Images of England 10 September 2009 ] Another prominent Bedford family, the Sales of Hope Carr Hall, had a great deal of influence in Bedford for over 400  years, and owned more land than the Shuttleworths. The family were recusants and secretly kept the &quot; old faith &quot; when Roman Catholic ism was subject to civil or criminal penalties. Hope Carr Hall was moat ed as was nearby Brick House. The manor house of Westleigh was at Higher Hall and existed in Richard I &apos;s time (1189–1199). In 1292 Sigreda, the heiress of the manor, married Richard de Urmston, and the manor passed to the Urmston family and remained there until the last of the male Urmstons died in 1659. It was later abandoned because of mining subsidence and Westleigh Old Hall became the manor by repute. The Ranicars and the Marsh families lived here. Westleigh Old Hall was another Leigh hall that had a moat. The Pennington family owned Pennington Hall from about 1200 until they were replaced by the family of Bradshaw or Bradshaigh in 1312. The Bradshaws held the manor until 1703 when John, the last of the male line died. Pennington Hall was rebuilt in 1748 by the then owner Samuel Hilton and in 1807 sold to the Gaskell family of Thornes, Wakefield, who let it to a succession of tenants. Around 1840 James Pownall, one of the founder members of the silk manufacturing firm of Bickam and Pownall was tenant. Later occupants were Charles Jackson, cotton manufacturer, Jabez Johnson, and F.W. Bouth founder of Bouth&apos;s Mill in 1862, The last resident was brewer, George Shaw who in 1920 offered the hall and grounds to the Leigh Corporation. The hall was converted to a museum and art gallery in 1928 but was demolished in 1963. The grounds are now Pennington Park. [ Civil War ] Leigh was divided in its allegiance during the English Civil War, some of the population supporting the Royalist s &apos; cause while others supported the Parliamentarians. A battle was fought in the town on 2  December 1642, when a group of Chowbenters, men from neighbouring Atherton, beat back and then routed Cavalier troops under the command of James Stanley, the 7th Earl of Derby. Sir Thomas Tyldesley of Myerscough and Morleys Hall, Astley, was killed on 25  August 1651 at the Battle of Wigan Lane and is buried in the Tyldesley Chapel in Leigh Parish Church. [ LeighTownTrailPart1 http://www.wigan.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/C3102275-1EB3-4DD8-BAB1-F1A8584BBA09/0/LeighTownTrailPart1_552kb.pdf Wigan.gov.uk 14 August 2009 ] The Earl of Derby passed through Leigh again in 1651, when he spent his last night in the King&apos;s Arms, before going on to his execution outside Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe Inn in Bolton. [ Industrial Revolution ] Butts Mill, Leigh At the end of the 16th century, although agriculture and the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, [ Leigh Cheese http://www.wlct.org/Culture/Heritage/pf41.pdf PDF 30 wlct 18 October 2009 ] spinning and weaving began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was brought from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished cloth. At first this work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by the end of the 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester. { Ackers (1978), p. 3. } It is a tradition in the town that a local man, Thomas Highs, was the inventor of a spinning jenny and the water frame in the 1760s, the latter invention being pirated by Richard Arkwright, who subsequently made a fortune from the patent royalties. [ http://books.google.com/?id%3Dh3MDAAAAYAAJ A Compedious History of the Cotton-Manufacture Richard Guest 1823 25 August 2009 1823 ] These 18th-century improvements to the spinning process meant that weavers were in great demand. { Ackers (1978), p. 4. } but as power looms were introduced in factories in Manchester there was less work for the handloom weavers and there was serious unemployment in the town. In 1827 silk weaving began in Leigh, either as the result of a dispute or a labour shortage in the Middleton silk industry. William Walker was a middleman who opened the first silk mill in Leigh in 1828, and others quickly followed, including James Pownall and Henry Hilton, whose mill survived until 1926. { Ackers (1978), p. 8. } { Holcroft (1998), p. 10. } Several cotton mill s were built in Leigh after the mid-1830s, and some silk mills converted to cotton after 1870. The Leigth Feight took place on 14 August 1839. The chartists had called for a strike at a time when there was social unrest over high levels of unemployment and the high cost of living. A mob of at least 2,000 gathered in Leigh. About 400-500 workers from Chowbent threatened to burn down Hayes Mill. A detachment of troops from Haydock was called out and special constables sworn in by the local magistrate. The Riot Act was read by Squire Thomas Withington of Culcheth Hall and for a while the mob dispersed but reassembled later. Many were injured in the fighting that took place and arrests were made. Those arrested were severely punished, while others ensured that radicalism continued in Leigh, leading eventually to electoral reform and universal suffrage. { Lunn (1958), pp.84-86. } The large multi-storey spinning mills came later, and five survive today. There were mill complexes at Kirkhall Lane and Firs Lane in Westleigh, Pennington and Bedford. Leigh Mill, otherwise known as Leigh Spinners [ Leigh Mill, Park Lane http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id%3D213535 Images of England 10 September 2009 ] is a Grade II* listed building.

[ Coal mining ] Parsonage Colliery in 1980 There had been drift mine s in Westleigh since the 12th century but during the second half of the 19th century it became possible to mine the deeper seams and coal began to be an important industry and coal mining became the largest user of labour after the textile industry in Leigh. { Ackers (1978), p. 11. } Parsonage Colliery, the last mine to be sunk in Leigh, was one of the deepest mines in the country, going down to over [ 3000 ft m -2 on ]. [ http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1934/feb/21/coal-industry-parsonage-colliery-leigh Parsonage Colliery 1934 hansard.millbanksystems.com 19 September 2009 ] The extent of the mining in Parsonage Colliery increased in the 1960s with the driving of a tunnel (the Horizon Tunnel), which accessed previously inaccessible seams around 6  ft (2  m) high that were easy to work on compared to the previous seams of coal of 3  ft (1  m) or less. The seams were wet, and a series of pumps was used to remove the water into underground canals before it was finally pumped into the canal at Leigh. The winding engine at Parsonage was a steam engine, fuelled by methane extracted from the mine, while the neighbouring Bickershaw Colliery had a superior electric system. In 1974, the two were linked underground, and all coal was wound up at Bickershaw, which had better winding facilities, while Parsonage was used for supplies. The entire Lancashire Coalfield is now closed to deep mining, although several open-cast mines are still in operation elsewhere in the county. Mining disasters in Leigh included the explosion of firedamp which caused the deaths of 38  miners at Bedford Colliery on 13 August 1886. [ Bedford Colliery Disaster http://www.cmhrc.co.uk/cms/document/1886_88.pdf PDF 1 cmhrc.co.uk 1 November 2009 ] There were several accidents at Bickershaw Colliery, but the most serious was in 1932, when 19  men were drowned in the sump at the bottom of the shaft after an overwind of the cage.
