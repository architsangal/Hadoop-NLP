[ History ] The earliest traces of human settlement date to the Neolithic with sites found near Stansstad that are from 4000–3100 BC. [ Ackermann Hansjacob Schleifer Karin Weber Emil Geschichte Nidwaldens: Ein kurzer Überblick March 2007 Staatsarchive Nidwalden 1 December 2008 ] The same sites, near Stansstad, also contain Late Bronze Age (1400–1100 BC) artifacts, with additional Bronze Age sites near Hergiswil and Ennetmoos. A La Tène (500–100 BC) grave for a 10 year old girl has been found in Stans. Based on these finds, it appears that the Nidwalden region has been settled since the 1st millennium BC. During the Roman Empire Ob and Nidwalden were inhabited by a Gallo-Roman or Celtic population. While there are few artifacts from the population, many names of the towns, rivers and mountains have either Celtic or Gallo-Roman roots. By the 8th century the Alemanni entered the valleys of present-day Nidwalden and intermingled. At this time a Roman Catholic church was built in Stans, most likely founded by an Alemanni noble family. The church in Stans would remain until the 10th century when it was replaced by a church in Buochs. Initially the land was owned by a number of noble families and abbey s. But by the late 13th century the major powers in Nidwalden had shrunk to three: the Habsburgs, Murbach Abbey and Engelberg Abbey. In 1291 Rudolph of Habsburg bought Obwalden from Murbach Abbey. In response the people of Nidwalden ( Obwalden joined shortly before the document was signed, the two halves forming Unterwalden ) [ Switzerland Encyclopædia Britannica 26 248 1911 http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Switzerland/History/Origins 21 December 2008 ] joined Uri and Schwyz to form an alliance which is considered the foundation of modern Switzerland. At the time there was no state, but towards the end of the 14th century early forms of government were established. This included institutionalized assemblies and courts. In the 14th and 15th century the people of Nidwalden joined the people of Obwalden to discuss important matters, but the two cantons were never really one. For example, Obwalden did not participate in the annexation of Bellinzona, Riviera and Blenio areas (today located in the canton of Ticino ). Around 1500 many people in Nidwalden worked as mercenary soldiers. Many of these soldiers later emigrated. This helped to lessen the pressure of a growing population. A popular destination was Alsace. Under the Helvetic Republic imposed in 1798 by French Revolution ary troops, Switzerland became a united country. The ideas of the French Revolution were not popular in some parts of the Swiss nation including Nidwalden. The cantons were accustomed to self-government and many resented the limits on the freedom of worship in particular. When rebel forces threatened the Republic, Nidwalden was attacked by French troops on 9 September 1798. The canton&apos;s infrastructure was badly damaged and at least 400 people were killed. After the end of Napoleonic rule in 1814, most of the changes were reverted. Only in 1877 did Nidwalden introduce a new constitution. The open assembly ( Landsgemeinde ) was abolished in 1997. [ Geography ] { Bannalpsee } Nidwalden is located in the centre of Switzerland. To the north it is bounded by the Lake Lucerne (Vierwaldstättersee), to all other directions by mountain chains ( Urner Alps ). The area of the canton is [ 276.1 km2 sqmi us ] of which about 40% is inhabited or used for farming. [ Federal Department of Statistics Regional Statistics for Nidwalden 2008 http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/regionen/regionalportraets/nidwalden/blank/kennzahlen.html 1 December 2008 ] Forests occupy about one third of the canton with about one quarter being considered unproductive (mountains or glaciers). [ Politics ] The cantonal executive (Regierungsrat) is composed of seven members. The local parliament has 60 seats. Nidwalden sends only one deputy to the Swiss Council of States. [ Municipalities ] There are eleven municipalities: Beckenried, Buochs, Dallenwil, Emmetten, Ennetbürgen, Ennetmoos, Hergiswil, Oberdorf, Stans, Stansstad and Wolfenschiessen. The capital is Stans. [ Demographics ] The population of the canton (as of [ CH-NW ] ) is [ CH-NW CH-NW ]. [ CH-NW ] [ 2007 ], the population included 4,046 foreigners, or about 10% of the total population. By gender the canton is nearly evenly split with 50.9% male and 49.1% female. In 2000, 75.6% of the population was Roman Catholic while 11.9% belong to the Swiss Reformed Church.

Most of the population ( [ 2000 on ] ) speaks German (92.5%) with a small minority speaking Italian (1.4%) or Serbo-Croatian (1.2%). [ Economy ] Up to the 20th century Nidwalden was dominated by agriculture. Cattle and cheese were exported mainly to northern Italy. Around 1500 many people in Nidwalden worked as mercenary soldiers. From the middle of the 19th century onwards, trade, industry and tourism gained momentum. Nevertheless, until the middle of the 20th century, agriculture dominated the canton. Today a great number of small and middle-sized businesses dominate the economy. The largest employer is the airplane constructor Pilatus. The small and middle-sized businesses work in a wide range of areas. Many specialize in machine construction, medical equipment, international trade, optics and electronics. Traditional areas such as forestry and agriculture are still of importance. Agriculture is specialized in cattle and dairy farming. The farms are still run by individual families. In recent years, Nidwalden is becoming an increasingly popular place to live and work. This is caused by its low taxes, its central location between Zürich and Milan, and its beautiful countryside. [ Tourism ] Peak of the Stanserhorn showing the restaurant and cable car Because of its mountainous geography, tourism is important in Nidwalden. The lake and the mountains attract many tourists, both during the winter and the summer. Major resorts include Klewenalp, Stanserhorn (mountain), the region around Bannalp, and Bürgenstock. [ Culture ] Traditional culture in Nidwalden has been kept alive by many local organizations. There is traditional music, yodeling, dances, theaters and festivals. There are also a number of modern cultural events, such a concerts and galleries.
