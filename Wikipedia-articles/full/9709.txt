[ August 2011 ] [ English Civil War the Wars of the Three Kingdoms 300px The victory of the Parliamentarian New Model Army, under Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, over the Royalist army, commanded by Prince Rupert, at the Battle of Naseby (June 14, 1645) marked the decisive turning point in the English Civil War. August 22 1642 – September 3 1651 Kingdom of England Parliamentarian victory; execution of king Charles I, establishment of the republican Commonwealth under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell. Royalists Parliamentarians Charles I Oliver Cromwell ] The English Civil War (1642–1651), often referred to as The Civil War in Great Britain, was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians ( Roundhead s ) and Royalists ( Cavalier s ). The first (1642–46) and second (1648–49) civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war (1649–51) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. The Civil War led to the trial and execution of Charles I, the exile of his son, Charles II, and replacement of English monarchy with, first, the Commonwealth of England (1649–53), and then with a Protectorate (1653–59), under Oliver Cromwell &apos;s personal rule. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament&apos;s consent, although this concept was legally established only with the Glorious Revolution later in the century. [ Terminology ] The term English Civil War appears most commonly in the singular form, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. Although the term describes events as impinging on England, from the outset the conflicts involved wars with and civil wars within both Scotland and Ireland; see Wars of the Three Kingdoms for an overview. Unlike other civil wars in England, which focused on who ruled, this war also concerned itself with the manner of governing the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica called the series of wars the Great Rebellion, while some historians, especially Marxist s such as Christopher Hill (1912–2003), have long favoured the term English Revolution. [ Hill 1972 for example ] {. } [ Background ] [ The King&apos;s Rule ] War broke out less than forty years after the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. At the accession of Charles I in 1625, England and Scotland had both experienced relative peace, both internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles hoped to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a new single kingdom, fulfilling the dream of his father, James VI of Scotland and I of England. [ Croft 2003 63 ] {. } Many English Parliamentarians had suspicions regarding such a move, because they feared that setting up a new kingdom might destroy the old English traditions which had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father&apos;s position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as &quot; little Gods on Earth &quot;, chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the &quot; Divine Right of Kings &quot; ), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification. [ McClelland 1996 224 ] {. } Charles I, painted by Van Dyck [ Parliament in the English constitutional framework ] Before the fighting, the Parliament of England did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government, functioning as a temporary advisory committee, summoned by the monarch whenever the Crown required additional tax revenue, and subject to dissolution by the monarch at any time. Because responsibility for collecting taxes lay in the hands of the gentry, the English kings needed the help of that stratum of society in order to ensure a continued stream of revenue. If the gentry refused to collect the King&apos;s taxes, the Crown would lack any practical means with which to compel them. Parliaments allowed representatives of the gentry to meet, confer and send policy-proposals to the monarch in the form of Bills. These representatives did not, however, have any means of forcing their will upon the king—except by withholding the financial means required to execute his plans. { William Dawson Johnston, The history of England from the accession of James the Second Volume I, Boston and New York, Houghton, Mifflin and company, 1901. } [ September 2009 ] [ Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right ] { Henrietta Maria, painted by } { Peter Lely, 1660 } One event to raise concerns over Charles&apos;s reign was his marriage to a Roman Catholic, French princess Henrietta Maria, in 1625, directly after ascending the throne. [ Gregg 1984 73 ] {. } Charles&apos;s marriage raised the possibility that his children, including an heir to the throne, might grow up Catholic, an alarming prospect for officially Protestant England, where the Church of England is led by the Supreme Governor, investing the Head of Church in the same person as the Head of State, in this instance the King. Charles was keen to intervene on the Protestant side of the Thirty Years&apos; War that was currently engulfing Europe. [ Gregg 1984 123 ] {. } Foreign wars necessitated heavy expenditures, and the Crown could raise taxes only through Parliamentary consent. Charles experienced further financial difficulty when his first Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him. [ Gregg 1984 129–30 ] {. } Charles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French Huguenots whom French royal troops held besieged in La Rochelle. Military support for Protestants on the Continent was, in itself, popular both in Parliament and with the Protestant majority in general, [ August 2011 ] and it had the potential to alleviate concerns brought about by the King&apos;s marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles&apos;s insistence on having his unpopular royal favourite George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham assume command of the English force undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627), [ Gregg 1984 166 ] {. } and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on royal patronage, opened impeachment proceedings against him. [ Gregg 1984 175 ] {. } Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This move, while saving Buckingham, reinforced the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers. Having dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included Oliver Cromwell and Edward Coke.) The new Parliament drew up the Petition of Right, and Charles accepted it as a concession in order to obtain his subsidy. [ Purkiss 2007 93 ] {. } Amongst other things, the Petition referred to Magna Carta. { Petition of Right at III, VII. } [ Personal rule ] Charles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the &quot; Eleven Years&apos; Tyranny &quot; or &quot; Charles&apos; Personal Rule &quot;. [ Rosner Theibault 2000 103 ] {. } During this period, Charles&apos; lack of money determined policies. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England&apos;s involvement in the Thirty Years&apos; War; however that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown&apos;s finances. Unable to raise revenue through Parliament – and unwilling to convene it – Charles resorted to other means. For example, not observing often long-outdated conventions became, in some cases, a finable offence (for example, a failure to attend and to receive knighthood at Charles&apos; coronation), with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through the ship money tax, by exploiting a naval war-scare in 1635, demanding that the inland English counties pay the tax for the Royal Navy. Established law supported this policy, but authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many regarded it as yet another extra-Parliamentary (and therefore illegal) tax. [ Pipes 1999 143 ] {. } Some prominent men refused to pay ship money arguing that the tax was illegal, but they lost in court and the fines imposed on them for refusing to pay ship money (and for standing against the tax&apos;s legality) aroused widespread indignation. During the &quot; Personal Rule, &quot; Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures: he believed in High Anglicanism, a sacramental version of the Church of England, theologically based upon Arminianism, a creed shared with his main political advisor, Archbishop William Laud. [ Carlton 1987 48 ] {. } In 1633, Charles appointed Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden communion tables with stone altars. [ Carlton 1987 96 ] {. } Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637 John Bastwick, Henry Burton, and William Prynne had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud&apos;s views—a rare penalty for gentlemen, and one that aroused anger. [ Purkiss 2007 201 ] {. } Moreover, the Church authorities revived the statutes passed in the time of Elizabeth I about church attendance, and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican church services. [ Carlton 1987 173 ] {. } [ Rebellion in Scotland ] [ Bishops&apos; War ] The end of Charles&apos; independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The Church of Scotland, reluctantly Episcopal in structure, had independent traditions. [ Purkiss 2007 74 ] {. } Charles, however, wanted one, uniform Church throughout Britain, [ Purkiss 2007 83 ] {. } and introduced a new, High Anglican, version of the English Book of Common Prayer to Scotland in summer of 1637. This was violently resisted; a riot broke out in Edinburgh, [ Purkiss 2007 75 ] {. } which may have been started in a church by Jenny Geddes; and, in February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the National Covenant. [ Purkiss 2007 77 ] {. } This document took the form of a &quot; loyal protest &quot;, rejecting all innovations not first having been tested by free parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church. In the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border, to end the rebellion known as the Bishops&apos; War, [ Purkiss 2007 96 ] {. } but, after an inconclusive military campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce – the Pacification of Berwick. The truce proved temporary and a second war followed in summer of 1640. This time, a Scots army defeated Charles&apos; forces in the north, then captured Newcastle. [ Purkiss 2007 97 ] {. } Charles eventually agreed not to interfere with Scotland&apos;s religion, and paid the Scots&apos; war-expenses. [ May 2008 ] [ Recall of the English Parliament ] Charles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland. He had insufficient funds, however, and needed to seek money from a newly elected English Parliament in 1640. [ Coward 2003 180 ] {. } The majority faction in the new Parliament, led by John Pym, took this appeal for money as an opportunity to discuss grievances against the Crown, and opposed the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this lèse-majesté (offence against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence the name &quot; the Short Parliament &quot;. Without Parliament&apos;s support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered a comprehensive defeat. The Scots then seized the opportunity and invaded England, occupying Northumberland and Durham. Meanwhile, another of Charles&apos; chief advisors, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth, had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632 [ Purkiss 2007 89 ] {. } and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions. [ Coward 2003 172 ] {. } In 1639 Charles recalled Wentworth to England, and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him work his magic again in Scotland. This time he proved less successful, and the English forces fled the field in their second encounter with the Scots in 1640. Almost the entirety of Northern England was occupied, and Charles was forced to pay £850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. If he did not, they would &quot; take &quot; the money by pillaging and burning the cities and towns of Northern England. [ Sharp 2000 13 ] {. } All this put Charles in a desperate financial position. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this. Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the Magnum Concilium (the House of Lords, but without the Commons, so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640. [ The Long Parliament ] [ Long Parliament ] Session of the Long Parliament The new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against Charles and his Government, and with Pym and Hampden (of ship money fame) in the lead, took the opportunity presented by the King&apos;s troubles to force various reforming measures—including many with strong &apos;anti-Papist&apos; themes—upon him. [ Purkiss 2007 104,5 ] {. } The legislators passed a law which stated that a new Parliament should convene at least once every three years—without the King&apos;s summons, if necessary. Other laws passed by the Parliament made it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent, and later, gave Parliament control over the king&apos;s ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since, this Parliament has been known as the &quot; Long Parliament &quot;. However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign The Protestation, an oath of allegiance to Charles. { See } [ Walter 1999 294 ] {, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors. } In early 1641 Parliament had Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, arrested and sent to the Tower of London on a charge of treason. John Pym claimed that Wentworth&apos;s statements of readiness to campaign against &quot; the kingdom &quot; were aimed in fact at England itself. Unable to prove the case in court, the House of Commons, led by Pym and Henry Vane, resorted to a Bill of Attainder. [ Purkiss 2007 116 ] {. } Unlike a guilty finding in a court case, attainder did not require a legal burden of proof, but it did require the king&apos;s approval. Charles, still incensed over the Commons&apos; handling of Buckingham, refused. Wentworth himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider. Wentworth&apos;s execution took place in May, 1641. { Jacob Abbott Charles I Chapter Downfall of Strafford and Laud } Instead of saving the country from war, Wentworth&apos;s sacrifice in fact doomed it to one. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, struck first, and all Ireland soon descended into chaos. [ Purkiss 2007 109–113 ] {. } Rumours circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all. { See } [ Purkiss 2007 113 ] { for the concerns of a similar English Catholic rising. } In early January 1642, accompanied by 400 soldiers, Charles attempted to arrest five members of the House of Commons on a charge of treason. [ Sherwood 1997 41 ] {. } This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of William Lenthall, the Speaker, as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied &quot; May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here. &quot; In other words, the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than of the King. [ Local grievances ] In the summer of 1642 these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose owing to many local grievances. For example, the imposition of drainage-schemes in The Fens negatively affected the livelihood of thousands of people after the King awarded a number of drainage-contracts. [ Hughes 1991 127 ] {. } Many regarded the King as worse than insensitive, and this played a role in bringing a large part of eastern England into Parliament’s camp. This sentiment brought with it people such as the Earl of Manchester and Oliver Cromwell, each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the Earl of Lindsey, was to die fighting for the King at the Battle of Edgehill. [ Purkiss 2007 180 ] {. } [ The First English Civil War ] Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (green), 1642—1645 [ First English Civil War ] In early January 1642, a few days after his failure to capture five members of the House of Commons, fearing for his own personal safety and for that of his family and retinue, Charles left the London area. [ Wedgwood 1970 57 ] {. } Further negotiations by frequent correspondence between the King and the Long Parliament through to early summer proved fruitless. As the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth under the command of Sir George Goring declared for the King, [ Wedgwood 1970 107 ] {. } but when Charles tried to acquire arms for his cause from Kingston upon Hull, the depository for the weapons used in the previous Scottish campaigns, Sir John Hotham, the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, initially refused to let Charles enter Hull, [ Wedgwood 1970 82 ] {. } and when Charles returned with more men, drove them off. [ Wedgwood 1970 100 ] {. } Charles issued a warrant for Hotham to be arrested as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it. Throughout the summer months, tensions rose and there was brawling in a number of places, with the first death of the conflict taking place in Manchester. [ Royle 2006 158–166 ] {. } At the outset of the conflict, much of the country remained neutral, though the Royal Navy and most English cities favoured Parliament, while the King found considerable support in rural communities. Historians estimate that between them, both sides had only about 15,000 men [ February 2007 ]. However, the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral, some formed bands of Clubmen to protect their localities against the worst excesses of the armies of both sides, [ Wedgwood 1970 403,4 ] {. } but most found it impossible to withstand both the King and Parliament. On one side, the King and his supporters thought that they fought for traditional government in Church and state. On the other, most supporters of the Parliamentary cause initially took up arms to defend what they thought of as the traditional balance of government in Church and state, which the bad advice the King had received from his advisers had undermined before and during the &quot; Eleven Years&apos; Tyranny &quot;. The views of the Members of Parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King – at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King&apos;s Oxford Parliament than at Westminster – through to radicals, who wanted major reforms in favour of religious independence and the redistribution of power at the national level. [ May 2008 ] However, even the most radical supporters of the Parliamentarian cause still favoured the retention of Charles on the throne. After the debacle at Hull, Charles moved on to Nottingham, where on 22 August 1642, he raised the royal standard. [ Wedgwood 1970 111 ] {. } When he raised his standard, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalry and a small number of Yorkshire infantry-men, and using the archaic system of a Commission of Array, [ Wedgwood 1970 96 ] {. } Charles&apos; supporters started to build a larger army around the standard. Charles moved in a south-westerly direction, first to Stafford, and then on to Shrewsbury, because the support for his cause seemed particularly strong in the Severn valley area and in North Wales. [ Royle 2006 170,183 ] {. } While passing through Wellington, in what became known as the &quot; Wellington Declaration &quot;, he declared that he would uphold the &quot; Protestant religion, the laws of England, and the liberty of Parliament &quot;. [ Sherwood 1992 6 ] {. } { Battle of Marston Moor, 1644 } The Parliamentarians who opposed the King had not remained passive during this pre-war period. As in the case of Kingston upon Hull they had taken measures to secure strategic towns and cities, by appointing men sympathetic to their cause, and on 9 June they had voted to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers, appointing Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex commander three days later. [ Wedgwood 1970 108,9 ] {. } He received orders &quot; to rescue His Majesty&apos;s person, and the persons of the Prince [of Wales ] and the Duke of York out of the hands of those desperate persons who were about them &quot;. [ Hibbert 1993 65 ] {. } The Lords Lieutenant, whom Parliament appointed, used the Militia Ordinance to order the militia to join Essex&apos;s army. [ Royle 2006 165,161 ] {. } Two weeks after the King had raised his standard at Nottingham, Essex led his army north towards Northampton, [ Wedgwood 1970 113 ] {. } picking up support along the way (including a detachment of Cambridgeshire cavalry raised and commanded by Oliver Cromwell ). { Cromwell had already secured Cambridge and the supplies of college silver – see } [ Wedgwood 1970 106 ] {. } By the middle of September Essex&apos;s forces had grown to 21,000 infantry and 4200 cavalry and dragoons. On 14 September he moved his army to Coventry and then to the north of the Cotswolds, { Wegwood, p.115. } a strategy which placed his army between the Royalists and London. With the size of both armies now in the tens of thousands, and only Worcestershire between them, it was inevitable that cavalry reconnaissance units would sooner or later meet. This happened in the first major skirmish of the Civil War, when a cavalry troop of about 1,000 Royalists commanded by Prince Rupert, a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war, [ Wedgwood 1970 148 ] {. } defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under the command of Colonel John Brown in the Battle of Powick Bridge, at a bridge across the River Teme close to Worcester. [ Royle 2006 171–188 ] {. } { Prince Rupert of the Rhine } Rupert withdrew to Shrewsbury, where a council-of-war discussed two courses of action: whether to advance towards Essex&apos;s new position near Worcester, or to march along the now opened road towards London. The Council decided to take the London route, but not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the Earl of Clarendon&apos;s words: &quot; it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way &quot;. { Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition Great Rebellion } Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days&apos; start on the enemy, and moved south-east. This had the desired effect, as it forced Essex to move to intercept them. The first pitched battle of the war, fought at Edgehill on 23 October 1642, proved inconclusive, and both the Royalists and Parliamentarians claimed it as a victory. [ Wedgwood 1970 130,1 ] {. } The second field action of the war, the stand-off at Turnham Green, saw Charles forced to withdraw to Oxford. [ Wedgwood 1970 135 ] {. } This city would serve as his base for the remainder of the war. [ Wedgwood 1970 167–8;506–7 ] {. } In 1643 the Royalist forces won at Adwalton Moor, and gained control of most of Yorkshire. [ Wedgwood 1970 209 ] {. } In the Midlands, a Parliamentary force under Sir John Gell besieged and captured the cathedral city of Lichfield, after the death of the original commander, Lord Brooke. [ Wanklyn Jones 2005 74 ] {. } This group subsequently joined forces with Sir John Brereton to fight the inconclusive Battle of Hopton Heath (19 March 1643), where the Royalist commander, the Earl of Northampton, was killed. Subsequent battles in the west of England at Lansdowne and at Roundway Down also went to the Royalists. [ Wanklyn Jones 2005 103 ] {. } Prince Rupert could then take Bristol. In the same year, Oliver Cromwell formed his troop of &quot; Ironsides &quot;, a disciplined unit that demonstrated his military leadership ability. With their assistance, he won a victory at the Battle of Gainsborough in July. [ Young Holmes 1974 151 ] {. } In general, the early part of the war went well for the Royalists. The turning point came in the late summer and early autumn of 1643, when the Earl of Essex&apos;s army forced the king to raise the siege of Gloucester [ Wedgwood 1970 232 ] {. } and then brushed the Royalist army aside at the First Battle of Newbury (20 September 1643), [ Wedgwood 1970 238 ] {. } in order to return triumphantly to London. Other Parliamentarian forces won the Battle of Winceby, [ Wedgwood 1970 248 ] {. } giving them control of Lincoln. Political manoeuvering to gain an advantage in numbers led Charles to negotiate a ceasefire in Ireland, freeing up English troops to fight on the Royalist side in England, [ Wedgwood 1970 298,9 ] {. } while Parliament offered concessions to the Scots in return for aid and assistance. With the help of the Scots, Parliament won at Marston Moor (2 July 1644), [ Wanklyn Jones 2005 189 ] {. } gaining York and the north of England. [ Wedgwood 1970 322 ] {. } Cromwell&apos;s conduct in this battle proved decisive, [ Wedgwood 1970 319 ] {. } and demonstrated his potential as both a political and an important military leader. The defeat at the Battle of Lostwithiel in Cornwall, however, marked a serious reverse for Parliament in the south-west of England. { Ashley, p.188. } Subsequent fighting around Newbury (27 October 1644), though tactically indecisive, strategically gave another check to Parliament. [ Wedgwood 1970 359 ] {. } { Oliver Cromwell } In 1645 Parliament reaffirmed its determination to fight the war to a finish. It passed the Self-denying Ordinance, by which all members of either House of Parliament laid down their commands, and re-organized its main forces into the New Model Army ( &quot; Army &quot; ), under the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax, with Cromwell as his second-in-command and Lieutenant-General of Horse. [ Wedgwood 1970 373 ] {. } In two decisive engagements—the Battle of Naseby on 14 June and the Battle of Langport on 10 July—the Parliamentarians effectively destroyed Charles&apos; armies. [ Wedgwood 1970 428 ] {. } In the remains of his English realm Charles attempted to recover a stable base of support by consolidating the Midlands. He began to form an axis between Oxford and Newark on Trent in Nottinghamshire. Those towns had become fortresses and showed more reliable loyalty to him than to others. He took Leicester, which lies between them, but found his resources exhausted. Having little opportunity to replenish them, in May 1646 he sought shelter with a Presbyterian Scottish army at Southwell in Nottinghamshire. [ Wedgwood 1970 519–520 ] {. } Charles was eventually handed over to the English Parliament by the Scots and was imprisoned. [ Wedgwood 1970 570 ] {. } This marked the end of the First English Civil War. [ The Second English Civil War ] [ Second English Civil War ] { William Frederick Yeames. } Charles I took advantage of the deflection of attention away from himself to negotiate a secret treaty with the Scots, again promising church reform, on 28 December 1647. [ Seel 1999 64 ] {. } Under the agreement, called the &quot; Engagement &quot;, the Scots undertook to invade England on Charles&apos; behalf and restore him to the throne on condition of the establishment of Presbyterianism for three years. [ http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/kingcharles.htm King Charles I Luminarium Encyclopedia 8 April 2010 ] A series of Royalist uprisings throughout England and a Scottish invasion occurred in the summer of 1648. Forces loyal to Parliament [ Fairax 1648 Letter ] {. } put down most of the uprisings in England after little more than skirmishes, but uprisings in Kent, Essex and Cumberland, the rebellion in Wales, and the Scottish invasion involved the fighting of pitched battles and prolonged sieges. In the spring of 1648 unpaid Parliamentarian troops in Wales changed sides. Colonel Thomas Horton defeated the Royalist rebels at the Battle of St Fagans (8 May) [ John 2008 127 ] {. } and the rebel leaders surrendered to Cromwell on 11 July after the protracted two-month siege of Pembroke. [ Trevelyan 2002 274 ] {. } Sir Thomas Fairfax defeated a Royalist uprising in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone on 1 June. Fairfax, after his success at Maidstone and the pacification of Kent, turned northward to reduce Essex, where, under their ardent, experienced and popular leader Sir Charles Lucas, the Royalists had taken up arms in great numbers. Fairfax soon drove the enemy into Colchester, but his first attack on the town met with a repulse and he had to settle down to a long siege. [ Trevelyan 2002 274,5 ] {. } { Battle of Maidstone. } In the North of England, Major-General John Lambert fought a very successful campaign against a number of Royalist uprisings—the largest that of Sir Marmaduke Langdale in Cumberland. [ Newman 2006 87 ] {. } Thanks to Lambert&apos;s successes, the Scottish commander, the Duke of Hamilton, had perforce to take the western route through Carlisle in his pro-Royalist Scottish invasion of England. [ Newman 2006 89 ] {. } The Parliamentarians under Cromwell engaged the Scots at the Battle of Preston (17 – 19 August). The battle took place largely at Walton-le-Dale near Preston in Lancashire, and resulted in a victory by the troops of Cromwell over the Royalists and Scots commanded by Hamilton. This Parliamentarian victory marked the end of the Second English Civil War. Nearly all the Royalists who had fought in the First Civil War had given their parole not to bear arms against the Parliament, and many honourable Royalists, like Lord Astley, refused to break their word by taking any part in the second war. So the victors in the Second Civil War showed little mercy to those who had brought war into the land again. On the evening of the surrender of Colchester, Parliamentarians had Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle shot. [ Trevelyan 2002 275 ] {. } Parliamentary authorities sentenced the leaders of the Welsh rebels, Major-General Rowland Laugharne, Colonel John Poyer and Colonel Rice Powel to death, but executed Poyer alone (25 April 1649), having selected him by lot. [ Gardiner 2006 46 ] {. } Of five prominent Royalist peers who had fallen into the hands of Parliament, three, the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, and Lord Capel, one of the Colchester prisoners and a man of high character, were beheaded at Westminster on 9 March. [ Gardiner 2006 12 ] {. } [ Trial of Charles I for treason ] The betrayal by Charles caused Parliament to debate whether to return the King to power at all. Those who still supported Charles&apos; place on the throne tried once more to negotiate with him. [ Aylmer 1980 23 ] {. } Furious that Parliament continued to countenance Charles as a ruler, the Army marched on Parliament and conducted &quot; Pride&apos;s Purge &quot; (named after the commanding officer of the operation, Thomas Pride ) in December 1648. [ Aylmer 1980 22 ] {. } Troops arrested 45 Members of Parliament and kept 146 out of the chamber. They allowed only 75 Members in, and then only at the Army&apos;s bidding. This Rump Parliament received orders to set up, in the name of the people of England, a High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I for treason. [ Aylmer 1980 p.25 ] {. } At the end of the trial the 59 Commissioners (judges) found Charles I guilty of high treason, as a &quot; tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy &quot;.

[ Kirby 1999 25 ] {. } [ The Third English Civil War ] [ Third English Civil War ] [ Ireland ] [ Cromwellian conquest of Ireland ] A 19th century representation of the Massacre at Drogheda, 1649 Ireland had known continuous war since the rebellion of 1641, with most of the island controlled by the Irish Confederates. [ Leniham 2008 121 ] {. } Increasingly threatened by the armies of the English Parliament after Charles I&apos;s arrest in 1648, the Confederates signed a treaty of alliance with the English Royalists. [ Leniham 2008 122 ] {. } The joint Royalist and Confederate forces under the Duke of Ormonde attempted to eliminate the Parliamentary army holding Dublin, but their opponents routed them at the Battle of Rathmines (2 August 1649). [ Leniham 2008 127 ] {. } As the former Member of Parliament Admiral Robert Blake blockaded Prince Rupert&apos;s fleet in Kinsale, Oliver Cromwell could land at Dublin on 15 August 1649 with an army to quell the Royalist alliance in Ireland. [ Leniham 2008 128 ] {. } Cromwell&apos;s suppression of the Royalists in Ireland during 1649 still has a strong resonance for many Irish people. After the siege of Drogheda, the massacre of nearly 3,500 people—comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and 700 others, including civilians, prisoners, and Catholic priests (Cromwell claimed all the men carrying arms)—became one of the historical memories that has driven Irish-English and Catholic-Protestant strife during the last three centuries. However, the massacre has significance mainly as a symbol of the Irish perception of Cromwellian cruelty, as far more people died in the subsequent guerrilla and scorched-earth fighting in the country than at infamous massacres such as Drogheda and Wexford. The Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland ground on for another four years until 1653, when the last Irish Confederate and Royalist troops surrendered. [ Leniham 2008 132 ] {. } The victors confiscated almost all Irish Catholic-owned land in the wake of the conquest and distributed it to the Parliament&apos;s creditors, to the Parliamentary soldiers who served in Ireland, and to English people who had settled there before the war. [ Leniham 2008 135–6 ] {. } [ Scotland ] [ Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms ] The execution of Charles I altered the dynamics of the Civil War in Scotland, which had raged between Royalists and Covenanter s since 1644. By 1649, the struggle had left the Royalists there in disarray and their erstwhile leader, the Marquess of Montrose, had gone into exile. At first, Charles II encouraged Montrose to raise a Highland army to fight on the Royalist side. [ Carpenter 2005 145 ] {. } However, when the Scottish Covenanters (who did not agree with the execution of Charles I and who feared for the future of Presbyterianism and Scottish independence under the new Commonwealth ) offered him the crown of Scotland, Charles abandoned Montrose to his enemies. However, Montrose, who had raised a mercenary force in Norway, had already landed and could not abandon the fight. He did not succeed in raising many Highland clans and the Covenanters defeated his army at the Battle of Carbisdale in Ross-shire on 27 April 1650. The victors captured Montrose shortly afterwards and took him to Edinburgh. On 20 May the Scottish Parliament sentenced him to death and had him hanged the next day. [ Carpenter 2005 146 ] {. } { Andrew Carrick Gow } Charles II landed in Scotland at Garmouth in Morayshire on 23 June 1650 [ Brett 2008 39 ] {. } and signed the 1638 National Covenant and the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant shortly after coming ashore. [ Brett 2008 41 ] {. } With his original Scottish Royalist followers and his new Covenanter allies, King Charles II became the greatest threat facing the new English republic. In response to the threat, Cromwell left some of his lieutenants in Ireland to continue the suppression of the Irish Royalists and returned to England. He arrived in Scotland on 22 July 1650 [ Reid Turner 2004 18 ] {. } and proceeded to lay siege to Edinburgh. By the end of August disease and a shortage of supplies had reduced his army, and he had to order a retreat towards his base at Dunbar. A Scottish army, assembled under the command of David Leslie, tried to block the retreat, but Cromwell defeated them at the Battle of Dunbar on 3 September. [ Reid Turner 2004 p. ] [ May 2010 ] {. } Cromwell&apos;s army then took Edinburgh, and by the end of the year his army had occupied much of southern Scotland. In July 1651, Cromwell&apos;s forces crossed the Firth of Forth into Fife and defeated the Scots at the Battle of Inverkeithing (20 July 1651). [ Carpenter 2005 158 ] {. } The New Model Army advanced towards Perth, which allowed Charles, at the head of the Scottish army, to move south into England. Cromwell followed Charles into England, leaving George Monck to finish the campaign in Scotland. Monck took Stirling on 14 August and Dundee on 1 September. [ Carpenter 2005 185 ] {. } The next year, 1652, saw the mopping up of the remnants of Royalist resistance, and under the terms of the &quot; Tender of Union &quot;, the Scots received 30 seats in a united Parliament in London, with General Monck appointed as the military governor of Scotland. [ Dand 1972 20 ] {. } [ England ] Although Cromwell&apos;s New Model Army had defeated a Scottish army at Dunbar, Cromwell could not prevent Charles II from marching from Scotland deep into England at the head of another Royalist army. [ Weiser 2003 1 ] {. } The Royalists marched to the west of England because English Royalist sympathies were strongest in that area, but although some English Royalists joined the army, they came in far fewer numbers than Charles and his Scottish supporters had hoped. Cromwell finally engaged and defeated the new king at Worcester on 3 September 1651. Charles II escaped, via safe houses and a famous oak tree, to France, ending the civil wars. [ Political control ] During the Wars, the Parliamentarians established a number of successive committees to oversee the war-effort. The first of these, the Committee of Safety, set up in July 1642, comprised 15 Members of Parliament. { Robert Plant, The Committee of Safety, British Civil Wars website, Retrieved 25 November 2009 } Following the Anglo -Scottish alliance against the Royalists, the Committee of Both Kingdoms replaced the Committee of Safety between 1644 and 1648. [ Kennedy 2000 96 ] {. } Parliament dissolved the Committee of Both Kingdoms when the alliance ended, but its English members continued to meet and became known as the Derby House Committee. A second Committee of Safety then replaced that committee. [ Episcopacy during the English Civil War ] [ May 2012 ] { William Laud, Charles I&apos;s Archbishop of Canterbury. } During the period of the English Civil War, the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the established church became a matter of heated political controversy. John Calvin formulated a doctrine of Presbyterianism, which held that in the New Testament the offices of presbyter and episkopos were identical; he rejected the doctrine of apostolic succession. Calvin&apos;s follower John Knox brought Presbyterianism to Scotland when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling hierarchy. This vision of at least partial democracy in ecclesiology paralleled the struggles between Parliament and the King. A body within the Puritan movement in the Church of England sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The Martin Marprelate tracts, applying the pejorative name of prelacy to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended Elizabeth I and her Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift. The vestments controversy also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as &quot; unedifying &quot; and even idolatrous. King James I, reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted &quot; No Bishop, no King &quot; as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as king, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his own authority. Matters came to a head when King Charles I appointed William Laud as the Archbishop of Canterbury; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full Anglican liturgy. The controversy eventually led to Laud&apos;s impeachment for treason by a bill of attainder in 1645, and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots&apos; violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the Bishops&apos; Wars in 1639–1640. During the height of Puritan power in the Commonwealth and the Protectorate, episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646. [ 1968 July The Episcopate during the Civil Wars, 1642-1649 The English Historical Review 83 328 pp. 523–537 Oxford University Press 564164 ] The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the Restoration of the monarchy with Charles II in 1660. { Episcopy. British Civil Wars, Commonwealth and Protectorate 1638–60. Retrieved on 12 August 2011. } [ Casualties ] As usual in wars of this era, disease caused more deaths than combat. There are no accurate figures for these periods, and it is not possible to give a precise overall figure for those killed in battle, as opposed to those who died from disease, or even from a natural decline in population. Figures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates. { Matthew White Selected Death Tolls for Wars, Massacres and Atrocities Before the 20th century: British Isles, 1641–52 } [ Carlton 1992 pp. 211 – 214 ] {. } In England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars. Historical records count 84,830 dead from the wars themselves. Counting in accidents and the two Bishops&apos; wars, an estimate of 190,000 dead is achieved, [ Carlton 1992 p. 211 ] {. } out of a total population of about five million. [ James 2003 187 ] { cites: } [ Carlton 1995 212 ] {. } Figures for Scotland are more unreliable and should be treated with greater caution. Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the Battle of Worcester were deported to New England, Bermuda and the West Indies to work for landowners as indentured labour ers [ Royle 2006 602 ] {. } ). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved, [ Carlton 1992 p. 212 ] {. } from a population of about one million. Figures for Ireland are described as &quot; miracles of conjecture &quot;. Certainly the devastation inflicted on Ireland was unbelievable, with the best estimate provided by Sir William Petty, the father of English demography. Although Petty&apos;s figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as being tentative. They do not include the estimate of 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many of those sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death. Petty estimates that 112,000 Protestants were killed through plague, war and famine, and that 504,000 Catholics were killed, giving an estimated total of 618,000 dead, [ Carlton 1992 p. 213 ] {. } from a pre-war population of about one and a half million. These estimates indicate that England suffered a 3.7% loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6%, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41% of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation to Ireland in particular. The Great Hunger of 1845–1852 resulted in a loss of 16% of the population, while during the Second World War the population of the Soviet Union fell by 16%. [ Carlton 1992 p. 214 ] {. } [ Popular gains ] Ordinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society during the 1640s to derive advantages for themselves. The contemporary guild democracy movement won its greatest successes among London&apos;s transport workers, notably the Thames watermen. { &quot; Christopher O&apos;Riordan, Self-determination and the London Transport Workers in the Century of Revolution &quot; (1992). } Rural communities seized timber and other resources on the sequestrated estates of royalists and Catholics, and on the estates of the royal family and the church hierarchy. Some communities improved their conditions of tenure on such estates. { Christopher O&apos;Riordan, &quot; Popular Exploitation of Enemy Estates in the English Revolution &quot;, } { History, vol. 78 (1993), pp.184–200. } The old status quo began a retrenchment after the end of the main civil war in 1646, and more especially after the restoration of monarchy in 1660. But some gains were long-term. The democratic element introduced in the watermen&apos;s company in 1642, for example, survived, with vicissitudes, until 1827. [ Lindley 1997 160 ] {. } [ Aftermath ] The wars left England, Scotland, and Ireland among the few countries in Europe without a monarch. In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many of the idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the Commonwealth of England ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting amongst various factions in Parliament, Oliver Cromwell ruled over the Protectorate as Lord Protector (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658. { See } [ Sherwood 1997 7–11 ] { for a longer analysis of the relationship between Cromwell&apos;s position, the former monarchy and the military. } Upon his death, Oliver Cromwell&apos;s son Richard became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him. [ Keeble 2002 6 ] {. } After seven months the Army removed Richard, and in May 1659 it re-installed the Rump. [ Keeble 2002 9 ] {. } However, since the Rump Parliament acted as though nothing had changed since 1653 and as though it could treat the Army as it liked, military force shortly afterwards dissolved this, as well. [ Keeble 2002 12 ] {. } After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed as the Army&apos;s pretence of unity finally dissolved into factions. [ Keeble 2002 34 ] {. } A historical civil war re-enactment Into this atmosphere General George Monck, Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland. On 4 April 1660, in the Declaration of Breda, Charles II made known the conditions of his acceptance of the Crown of England. [ Keeble 2002 31 ] {. } Monck organised the Convention Parliament, [ Keeble 2002 48 ] {. } which met for the first time on 25 April 1660. On 8 May 1660, it declared that King Charles II had reigned as the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I in January 1649. Charles returned from exile on 23 May 1660. On 29 May 1660, the populace in London acclaimed him as king. [ Lodge 2007 5,6 ] {. } His coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661. These events became known as the Restoration. [ Lodge 2007 6 ] {. } Although the monarchy was restored, it was still only with the consent of Parliament; therefore, the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course to adopt a parliamentary monarchy form of government. [ Lodge 2007 8 ] {. } This system would result in the outcome that the future Kingdom of Great Britain, formed in 1707 under the Acts of Union, would manage to forestall the kind of often-bloody revolution, typical of European republican movements that followed the Jacobin revolution in 18th century France and the later success of Napoleon, which generally resulted in the total abolition of monarchy. It was no coincidence that the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the Glorious Revolution and in the 1701 Act of Settlement. After the Restoration, Parliament&apos;s factions became political parties (later becoming the Tories and Whigs ) with competing views and varying abilities to influence the decisions of their monarchs. [ May 2008 ] [ Historiography and explanations of the English Civil War ] In the early decades of the 20th century the Whig school was the dominant theoretical view. They explained the Civil War as resulting from a centuries-long struggle between Parliament (especially the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to arbitrarily dictate law. The most important Whig historian, S.R. Gardiner, popularised the English Civil War as a &apos;Puritan Revolution&apos;: challenging the repressive Stuart Church, and preparing the way for religious toleration in the Restoration. Thus, Puritanism was the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power. The Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the Marxist school, which became popular in the 1940s, and which interpreted the English Civil War as a bourgeois revolution. According to Marxist historian Christopher Hill : [ Kaye 1995 p. 106 ] { quoting Hill from his pamphlet The English Revolution 1640 } In the 1970s, a new generation of historians, who would become known as Revisionists challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories. [ Burgess 1990 609–627 ] {. } In 1973, a group of revisionist historians published the anthology The Origins of the English Civil War ( Conrad Russell ed.). These historians disliked both Whig and Marxist explanations of the Civil War as long-term socio-economic trends in English society, producing work focused on the minutiae of the years immediately preceding the civil war, thereby returning to the contingency-based historiography of Clarendon&apos;s famous contemporary history History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England. This, it was claimed, demonstrated that factional war-allegiance patterns did not fit either Whig or Marxist history. [ Gaunt 2000 60 ] {. } Parliament was not inherently progressive with the events of the 1640 a precursor for the Glorious Revolution, [ Gaunt 2000 60, 61 ] {. } or that Puritans, for example, did not necessarily ally themselves with Parliamentarians. [ September 2008 ] Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament. Thus, revisionist historians claim to have discredited some Whig and Marxist interpretations of the English Civil War. [ June 2008 ] Jane Ohlmeyer discarded and replaced the historical title &quot; English Civil War &quot; with the titles the &quot; Wars of the Three &quot; and the &quot; British Civil Wars &quot;, positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood isolated from events in other parts of Great Britain and Ireland; King Charles I remains crucial, not just as King of England, but also because of his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the Covenanter s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near permanent crisis management; often he was not willing to concede enough ground to any one faction to neutralise the threat, and in some circumstances to do so would only antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion. { Ohlmeyer, Jane.
