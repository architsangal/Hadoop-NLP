[ March 2012 ] [ 244 m ] { Thorpe Fell Top } { Marilyn } { West Yorkshire, } { SE114452 } { OS Landranger104 } Ilkley Moor is part of Rombalds Moor, the moorland between Ilkley and Keighley in West Yorkshire, England. The moor, which rises to 402  m (1,319  ft) above sea level is famous as the inspiration for the Yorkshire &quot; county anthem &quot; On Ilkla Moor Baht &apos;at. [ Geology ] During the Carboniferous period (325 million years ago), Ilkley Moor was part of a sea level swampy area fed by meandering river channels coming from the north. The layers in the eroded bank faces of stream gullies in the area represent sea levels with various tides depositing different sorts of sediment. Over a long period of time the sediments were cemented and compacted into hard rock layers. Geological forces lifted and tilted the strata a little towards the south-east, producing many small fractures, or faults.Since the end of the Carboniferous time there has been erosion and more than a thousand metres of the coal-bearing rocks have been completely removed from the area. During the last million years, Ice Age glaciers modified the shape of the Wharfe valley, deepening it, smoothing it and leaving behind glacial debris. { Information courtesy of David Leather of the Wharfedale Naturalists&apos; Society; in leaflet literature from Bracken Hall Countryside Centre. } The millstone grit not only gives character to the town of Ilkley but gives the area its acid soils, heather moors, soft water and rocky scars. [ History ] Ilkley Moor on a clear evening as the daylight falls. To the north, where the moor drops steeply towards the village of Ben Rhydding, a satellite of the town of Ilkley, are two millstone grit rock climbing areas: Rocky Valley and Ilkley Quarry. Ilkley Quarry is the site of the famous &quot; Cow and Calf &quot;, a large rock formation consisting of an outcrop and boulder, also known as Hangingstone Rocks. The rocks are made of millstone grit, a variety of sandstone, and are so named because one is large, with the smaller one sitting close to it, like a cow and [ calf ]. Legend has it that there was once also a &quot; bull &quot;, but that was quarried for stone during the spa town boom that Ilkley was part of in the 19th century. However, none of the local historians has provided any evidence of the Bull&apos;s existence. According to legend, the Calf was split from the Cow when the giant Rombald was fleeing an enemy, and stamped on the rock as he leapt across the valley. The enemy, it is said, was his angry wife. She dropped the stones held in her skirt to form the local rock formation The Skirtful of Stones.

In the figure in the foreground of the picture is a 20th century replica; the original carving can be seen a little further away. This stone is just one of a great abundance of carved rocks on the moor, well known others include the &apos;Badger Stone&apos; and &apos;St. Margaret&apos;s Stones&apos;. These are earthfast boulders, large flat slabs or prominent rocks that have cups, rings and grooves cut into them and thought to date from either the late Neolithic or the Bronze Age. While some carvings consist of simple cups, others such as the Badger Stone, Hanging Stones and the Panorama Rocks have complex series of patterns (or motifs) combining many different elements. Indeed Rombald&apos;s Moor can boast the second highest concentration of ancient carved stones in Europe, with carving as far away as Skipton Moor. There is also a small stone circle known as &apos;The Twelve Apostles&apos;.
