It is also distributed throughout the United States on a pay basis. It was the first of the big-city tabloids that came to be known as alternative weeklies. { Association of Alternative Newsmedia directory; The Village Voice } [ History ] October 1955 cover The Voice was launched by Ed Fancher, Dan Wolf, John Wilcock, and Norman Mailer { Lawrence van Gelder, Dan Wolf, 80, a Village Voice Founder, Dies, The New York Times, April 12, 1996. Accessed online June 2, 2008. } on October 26, 1955 from a two-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village, which was its initial coverage area, expanding to other parts of the city by the 1960s. The offices in the 1960s were located at Sheridan Square; they are now at Cooper Square in the East Village. The Voice has published groundbreaking investigations of New York City politics, as well as reporting on local and national politics, with arts, culture, music, dance, film, and theater reviews. The Voice has received three Pulitzer Prize s, in 1981 ( Teresa Carpenter ), { The Pulitzer Prize Winners, 1981, official Pulitzer Prize site. Accessed online June 5, 2008. } 1986 ( Jules Feiffer ) { The Pulitzer Prize Winners, 1986, official Pulitzer Prize site.

Accessed online June 5, 2008. } Almost since its inception the paper has recognized alternative theater in New York through its Obie Awards. { About the OBIES, official Obies site (part of Village Voice site). Accessed online June 5, 2008. } The paper&apos;s &quot; Pazz &amp; Jop &quot; music poll, started by Robert Christgau in the early 1970s, continues to this day and remains a highly influential survey of the nation&apos;s music critics. In 1999, film critic J. Hoberman and film section editor Dennis Lim began a similar Village Voice Film Poll for the year&apos;s movies. In 2001 the paper sponsored its first Siren Festival music festival, a free annual event every summer held at Coney Island. That event has since been moved to the lower tip of Manhattan and re-christened the &quot; 4Knots Music Festival, &quot; a reference to the speed of the East River&apos;s current. { Maura Johnston, &quot; Announcing The 4Knots Music Festival, Taking Place This July 16 &quot;, The Village Voice Blogs, April 14, 2011. } The Voice has published many well-known writers, including Ezra Pound, Henry Miller, Barbara Garson, Katherine Anne Porter, M.S.Cone, staff writer and author, James Baldwin, E.E. Cummings, Nat Hentoff, Ted Hoagland, staff writer and author, William Bastone of thesmokinggun.com, Tom Stoppard, Lorraine Hansberry, Allen Ginsberg and Joshua Clover. Former editors have included Clay Felker and Tom Morgan. Early columnists of the 1950s and 1960s included Jonas Mekas, who explored the underground film movement in his &quot; Film Journal &quot; column; Linda Solomon, who reviewed the Village club scene in the &quot; Riffs &quot; column; and Sam Julty, who wrote a popular column on car ownership and maintenance. John Wilcock wrote a column every week for the paper&apos;s first ten years. Another regular from that period was the cartoonist Kin Platt, who did weekly theatrical caricatures. Other prominent regulars have included Peter Schjeldahl, Ellen Willis, Tom Carson, Wayne Barrett, and Richard Goldstein. The newspaper has also been a host to promising underground cartoonists. In addition to mainstay Jules Feiffer, whose cartoon ran for decades in the paper until its cancellation in 1996, well-known cartoonists featured in the paper have included R. Crumb, Matt Groening, Lynda Barry, Stan Mack, Mark Alan Stamaty, Ted Rall, Tom Tomorrow, Ward Sutton, Ruben Bolling and currently M. Wartella. The Voice is also known for containing adult content, including sex-advice columns and many pages of advertising for &quot; adult services. &quot; This content is located at the back of the newspaper. The Voice is also locally known for being the place where most hard rock or jazz concerts are announced, sometimes with full page paid ads. Most groups visiting New York advertise in the Voice for publicity. Most venues in NYC advertise their concerts in The Village Voice. The Voice&apos;s competitors in New York City include New York Observer and Time Out New York. In 1996, after decades of carrying a cover price, the Voice became one of the last alternative weeklies in America to become free of charge.

April 22, 1996 ] (The paper is free in the five boroughs only; it still carries a charge for home/mail delivery and for newsstands outside the city limits, such as on Long Island.) The Voice’s web site is a past winner of both the National Press Foundation ’s Online Journalism Award (2001) { Excellence in Online Journalism Award: Past Winners 2000–2006, NPF Awards, National Press Foundation. Accessed online June 2, 2008. } and the Editor &amp; Publisher EPpy Award for Best Overall U.S. Newspaper Online Service – Weekly, Community, Alternative &amp; Free (2003). { Winners – 2003, EPpy Awards. Accessed online June 2, 2008. } Early in its history the newspaper had a reputation as having an anti- homosexual slant. When reporting on the Stonewall riots of 1969, the newspaper referred to the riots as &quot; The Great Faggot Rebellion &quot;. Two reporters, Smith and Truscott, both used the words &apos;faggot&apos; and &apos;dyke&apos; in their articles about the riots. (These words were not commonly used by homosexuals to refer to each other at this time.) After the riot, the Gay Liberation Front attempted to promote dances for gays and lesbians and were not allowed to use the words gay or homosexual which the newspaper considered derogatory. The newspaper changed their policy after the GLF petitioned the Voice to do so. { Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked The Gay Revolution. Carter, David. p. 226. } The Voice was the second organization in the US known to have extended domestic partner benefits, in July 1982. Jeff Weinstein, an employee of the paper and shop steward for the publishing local of District 65 UAW, negotiated and won agreement in the union contract to extend health, life insurance, and disability benefits to the &quot; spouse equivalents &quot; of its union members. { DomesticPartners } Seventeen alternative weeklies around the United States are owned by the Voice&apos;s parent company Village Voice Media. In 2005, the Phoenix alternative weekly chain New Times Media purchased the company and took the Village Voice Media name. Previous owners of the Village Voice or of Village Voice Media have included co-founders Fancher and Wolf, New York City Councilman Carter Burden, New York Magazine founder Clay Felker, Rupert Murdoch, and Leonard Stern of the Hartz Mountain empire. The paper is referenced in the musical Rent during the song La Vie Boheme. The line goes: &quot; To riding your bike midday past the three piece suits, to fruits, to no absolutes; to Absolut; to choice; to The Village Voice, to any passing fad. &quot; [ Changes after New Times Media acquisition ] [ An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism ] Since being acquired by New Times Media in 2005, the publication&apos;s key personnel have changed and the content has become increasingly mainstream. The Voice is now managed by two journalists from Phoenix, Arizona. Some New York media critics perceive a loss of the paper&apos;s original iconoclastic, bohemian spirit. { Jonathan Mandell, &quot; Bigger Media, Less Local Democracy &quot;, Gotham Gazette, February 2007. Accessed June 8, 2008. } { Adam Reilly, &quot; Culture War &quot;, The Phoenix (Boston), March 2, 2007. Accessed June 8, 2008. } In April 2006, the Voice dismissed music editor Chuck Eddy. { Ben Sisario, &quot; Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bloggy: An Online Poll Covets the Territory Once Owned by Pazz &amp; Jop &quot;, The New York Times, November 30, 2006. Accessed June 8, 2008. } Four months later the newspaper fired longtime music critic Robert Christgau. In January 2007, the newspaper fired sex columnist and erotica author Rachel Kramer Bussel; long-term creative director Ted Keller, art director Minh Oung, fashion columnist Lynn Yeager and Deputy Art Director LD Beghtol were laid off/fired soon after. The paper has experienced high turnover among its editorial leadership since 2005. Editor-in-chief Don Forst resigned in December 2005. Doug Simmons, his replacement, was fired in March 2006 after it was discovered that a reporter had fabricated portions of an article. Simmons&apos; successor, Erik Wemple, resigned after two weeks. His replacement, David Blum, was fired in March 2007. [ 2007 April ], Tony Ortega, former editor of the Broward - Palm Beach New Times, is editor. In December 2008, The New York Times reported that the situation grew so strained that half of its entire staff was gone. One still-employed writer remarked that the Voice&apos;s managers &quot; don’t seem to be able to sit there and just talk about them with their own work force to deal with these problems &quot;. { &quot; Village Voice Lays Off Nat Hentoff and 2 Others &quot;. The New York Times, December 30, 2008. } Tony Ortega and the Voice became embroiled in a legal dispute with philanthropist and businessman David Bruce McMahan after it published investigative reports surrounding his reported incestuous relationship with his daughter in 2010. [ Village Voice Tony Ortega MEMO TO BRUCE McMAHAN, DAUGHTER-SEDUCER (UPDATED) 7 October 2010 http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/10/memo_to_bruce_m.php?page%3D4 ] The paper alleged that McMahan was also having the controversy systematically removed from his Wikipedia page.
