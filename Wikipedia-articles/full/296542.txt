[ Etymology ] The name Chrysanthemum is derived from the Greek words, chrysos (gold) and anthemon (flower). { landscaping.about.com } [ Taxonomy ] The genus once included more species, but was split several decades ago into several genera, putting the economically important florist&apos;s chrysanthemum in the genus Dendranthema. The naming of the genera has been contentious, but a ruling of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature in 1999 changed the defining species of the genus to Chrysanthemum indicum, restoring the florist&apos;s chrysanthemum to the genus Chrysanthemum. The other species previously included in the narrow view of the genus Chrysanthemum are now transferred to the genus Glebionis. The other genera separate from Chrysanthemum include Argyranthemum, Leucanthemopsis, Leucanthemum, Rhodanthemum, and Tanacetum. Chrysanthemum are herbaceous perennial plant s growing to 50–150  cm tall, with deeply lobed leaves with large flower heads that are generally white, yellow or pink in the wild and are the preferred diet of larva e of certain lepidoptera species — see list of Lepidoptera that feed on chrysanthemums. [ History ] Historical painting of Chrysanthemums from the New International Encyclopedia 1902. Chrysanthemums were first cultivated in China as a flowering herb as far back as the 15th century BC. { History of the Chrysanthemum. National Chrysanthemum Society USA } The plant is renowned as one of the Four Gentlemen in Chinese and East Asian art. The plant is particularly significant during the Double Ninth Festival. It is believed that the flower may have been brought to Japan in the 8th century CE [ November 2010 ], and the Emperor adopted the flower as his official seal. There is a &quot; Festival of Happiness &quot; in Japan that celebrates the flower. The flower was brought to Europe in the 17th century [ November 2010 ]. Linnaeus named it from the Greek word χρυσός chrysous, &quot; golden &quot; (the colour of the original flowers), and ἄνθεμον -anthemon, meaning flower. [ Economic uses ] [ section September 2010 ] [ section September 2010 ] [ Ornamental uses ] In many countries, Chrysanthemums are a beautiful reminder that Autumn has arrived Modern chrysanthemums are much more showy than their wild relatives. The flower s occur in various forms, and can be daisy-like, decorative, pompons or buttons. This genus contains many hybrids and thousands of cultivar s developed for horticultural purposes. In addition to the traditional yellow, other colors are available, such as white, purple, and red. The most important hybrid is Chrysanthemum × morifolium (syn. C. × grandiflorum), derived primarily from C. indicum but also involving other species. Chrysanthemums are broken into two basic groups, Garden Hardy and Exhibition. Garden hardy mums are new perennials capable of being wintered over in the ground in most northern latitudes. Exhibition varieties are not usually as sturdy. Garden hardies are defined by their ability to produce an abundance of small blooms with little if any mechanical assistance (i.e., staking) and withstanding wind and rain. Exhibition varieties on the other hand require staking, over-wintering in a relatively dry cool environment, sometimes with the addition of night lights. The Exhibition varieties can be used to create many amazing plant forms; Large disbudded blooms, spray forms, as well as many artistically trained forms, such as: Thousand Bloom, Standard (trees), Fans, Hanging Baskets, Topiary, Bonsai, and Cascades. Chrysanthemum blooms are divided into 13 different bloom forms by the US National Chrysanthemum Society, Inc., which is in keeping with the international classification system. The bloom forms are defined by the way in which the ray and disk florets are arranged. Chrysanthemum blooms are composed of many individual flowers (florets), each one capable of producing a seed. The disk florets are in the center of the bloom head, and the ray florets are on the perimeter. The ray florets are considered imperfect flowers, as they only possess the female productive organs, while the disk florets are considered perfect flowers as they possess both male and female reproductive organs. Irregular Incurve: These are the giants of the chrysanthemum world. Quite often disbudded to create a single giant bloom (ogiku), the disk florets are completely concealed, while the ray florets curve inwardly to conceal the disk and also hang down to create a &apos;skirt&apos;. Reflex: The disk florets are concealed and the ray florets reflex outwards to create a mop like appearance. Regular Incurve: Similar to the irregular incurves, only usually smaller blooms, with nearly perfect globular form. Disk florets are completely concealed. They used to be called &apos;Chinese&apos;. Decorative: Similar to reflex blooms without the mop like appearance. Disk florets are completely concealed, ray florets usually don&apos;t radiate at more than a 90 degree angle to the stem. Intermediate Incurve: These blooms are in-between the Irregular and Regular incurves in both size and form. They usually have broader florets and a more loosely composed bloom. Again, the disk florets are completely concealed. Pompon: *Note the spelling, it is not pompom. The blooms are fully double, of small size, and almost completely globular in form. Single/Semi-Double: These blooms have completely exposed disk florets, with between 1 and 7 rows of ray florets, usually radiating at not more than a 90 degree angle to the stem. Anemone: The disk florets are prominently featured, quite often raised and overshadowing the ray florets. Spoon: The disk florets are visible and the long tubular ray florets are spatulate. Quill: The disk florets are completely concealed, and the ray florets are tube like. Spider: The disk florets are completely concealed, and the ray florets are tube like with hooked or barbed ends, hanging loosely around the stem. Brush &amp; Thistle: The disk florets may be visible. The ray florets are often tube like, and project all around the flower head, or project parallel to the stem. Exotic: These blooms defy classification as they possess the attributes of more than one of the other twelve bloom types. Chrysanthemum leaves resemble its close cousin, the mugwort weed — so much so that mugwort is sometimes called wild chrysanthemum — making them not always the first choice for professional gardeners. [ Culinary uses ] Yellow or white chrysanthemum flowers of the species C. morifolium are boiled to make a sweet drink in some parts of Asia. The resulting beverage is known simply as &quot; chrysanthemum tea &quot; ( 菊 花 茶, pinyin : júhuā chá, in Chinese ). Chrysanthemum tea has many medicinal uses, including an aid in recovery from influenza. In Korea, a rice wine flavored with chrysanthemum flowers is called gukhwaju (국화주). photo 1 photo 2 Chrysanthemum leaves are steamed or boiled and used as greens, especially in Chinese cuisine. Other uses include using the petals of chrysanthemum to mix with a thick snake meat soup (蛇羹) in order to enhance the aroma. [ Insecticidal uses ] Pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum [or Tanacetum ] cinerariaefolium) is economically important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are pulverized, and the active components called pyrethrin s, contained in the seed cases, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insect s, and inhibit female mosquito es from biting. When not present in amounts fatal to insects, they still appear to have an insect repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammal s and bird s than many synthetic insecticides, except in consumer airborne backyard applications. They are non-persistent, being biodegradable and also breaking down easily on exposure to light. They are considered to be amongst the safest insecticides for use around food. ( Pyrethroid s are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum, e.g., permethrin.)

The Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum is a Japanese honor awarded by the emperor. The city of Nihonmatsu, Japan hosts the &quot; Nihonmatsu Chrysanthemum Dolls Exhibition &quot; every autumn in historical ruin of Nihonmatsu Castle. In Imperial Japan, small arms were required to be stamped with the Imperial Chrysanthemum as they were considered the personal property of the Emperor.
