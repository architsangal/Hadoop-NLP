Another one of his best known works is Crete: The Battle and the Resistance for which he won the Runciman Prize, administered by the Anglo-Hellenic League for stimulating interest in Greek history and culture. [ Criticism ] Berlin: The Downfall 1945 encountered criticism in Russia.

Rzheshevsky, a professor and the president of the Russian Association of World War II Historians, has charged that Beevor is merely resurrecting the discredited and racist views of Neo-Nazi historians, who depicted Soviet troops as subhuman &quot; Asiatic hordes &quot;. { Review of Berlin: 1945 (In Russian). } He claimed that Beevor&apos;s use of phrases such as &quot; Berliners remember &quot; and &quot; the experiences of the raped German women &quot; were better suited &quot; for pulp fiction, than scientific research &quot;. Rzheshevsky also defended Soviet reprisals against Germans, stating that the Germans could have expected an &quot; avalanche of revenge &quot;. [ Summers Chris Red Army rapists exposed BBC News Online 29 April 2002 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1939174.stm 27 May 2010 ] Beevor has responded to Russian claims. He states that he used excerpts from the report of General Tsigankov, the chief of the political department of the 1st Ukrainian Front, to cite the incident. He responded to Rzheshevsky by saying, &quot; Professor O.A. Rzheshevsky even accused me of repeating Nazi propaganda, when in fact the bulk of the evidence on the subject came from Soviet sources, especially the NKVD reports in GARF ( State Archive of the Russian Federation ), and a wide range of reliable personal accounts. &quot; Beevor stated that he hopes that Russian historians will &quot; take a more objective approach to material in their own archives which are at odds to the heroic myth of the Red Army as &quot; liberators &quot; in 1945 &quot;.

Overy accused the Russians of refusing to acknowledge Soviet war crimes, &quot; Partly this is because they felt that much of it was justified vengeance against an enemy who committed much worse, and partly it was because they were writing the victors&apos; history. &quot; Beevor has stated that German women were part of a society that supported Hitler and thus cannot be seen as victims in the same way as Jews, Poles and Russians.
