The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Delaware Legislature, to convene the legislature, { DE Const. art. III } and to grant pardon s, except in cases of impeachment, and only with the recommendation of the Board of Pardons. { DE Const. art. VII, § 1 } There have been 70 people who have served as governor, over 73 distinct terms. Additionally, Henry Molleston was elected, but died before he could take office. Only four governors have been elected to two consecutive terms, with the longest-serving being Ruth Ann Minner, who was elected twice after succeeding to the office, serving a total of just over eight years. The shortest term is that of Dale E. Wolf, who served 18 days following his predecessor&apos;s resignation; David P. Buckson served 19 days under similar circumstances. The current governor is Jack Markell, who took office on January 20, 2009; his first term expires on January 15, 2013. [ Governors ] For the period before independence, see the List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania. Delaware was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was the first state to ratify the United States Constitution, on December 7, 1787. Before it declared its independence, Delaware was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain, known as the &quot; Lower Counties on Delaware &quot;. This colony was administered by colonial governors in Pennsylvania. The first state constitution, adopted in 1776 soon after independence, created the office of president, to be chosen by the legislature to serve a term of three years. { 1776 Const. art 7 } The constitution of 1792 renamed the position to governor, { 1792 Const. art. III, § 1 } set the commencement date of the term to the third Tuesday in the January following an election, and limited governors to serving only three out of any six years. { 1792 Const. art. III, § 3 } The term was lengthened to four years by the 1831 constitution, but governors were limited to a single term. { 1831 Const. art III, § 3 } The current constitution of 1897 allows governors to serve two terms. { DE Const. art. III, § 5 } The 1776 constitution stated that if the office of governor was vacant, the speaker of the legislative council would be a vice-president. { 1776 Const. art. 7 } The 1792 constitution has the speaker of the senate exercising the office if it is vacant, and the 1897 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, { DE Const. art. III, § 19 } upon whom the office devolves in case of vacancy. { DE Const. art. III, § 20 } The offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected at the same time but not on the same ticket. { American (1) } { 1px solid #aaaaaa } { Democratic (21) Includes one term served by a repeat governor. } { 1px solid #aaaaaa } { Democratic-Republican (5) } { 1px solid #aaaaaa } { Federalist (13) Includes one term served by a repeat governor.
