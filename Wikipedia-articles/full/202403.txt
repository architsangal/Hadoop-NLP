The phylogenetic category Excavata, proposed by Cavalier-Smith in 2002, contains a variety of free-living and symbiotic forms, and also includes some important parasites of humans. [ Characteristics ] Many excavates lack &apos;classical&apos; mitochondria - these organisms are often referred to as &apos;amitochondriate&apos;, although most, perhaps all, retain a mitochondrial organelle in greatly modified form. Others have mitochondria with tubular, discoidal, or in some cases, laminar crista e. Most excavates have two, four, or more flagella [ Simpson AG Cytoskeletal organization, phylogenetic affinities and systematics in the contentious taxon Excavata (Eukaryota) Int. J. Syst. Evol.

The closest that the excavates come to multicellularity are the Acrasidae slime molds. Like other cellular slime molds, they live most of their life as single cells, but will sometimes assemble into a larger cluster. [ Subgroups ] [ Eukaryote#Phylogeny ] Excavates are classified into six major subgroups at the phylum/class level. These are shown in the table below. Superphylum Phylum/Class Representative genera Description Discoba  or  JEH Euglenozoa e.g. Euglena,   Trypanosoma Many important parasites, one large group with plastids (chloroplasts) Heterolobosea  (Percolozoa) e.g. Naegleria, Acrasis Most alternate between flagellate and amoeboid forms Jakobea e.g. Jakoba, Reclinomonas Free-living, sometimes loricate flagellates, with very gene-rich mitochondrial genomes Metamonada  or  POD Preaxostyla e.g. Oxymonads, Trimastix Amitochondriate flagellates, either free-living ( Trimastix ) or living in the hindguts of insects Fornicata e.g.   Giardia,   Carpediemonas Amitochondriate, mostly symbiotes and parasites of animals. Parabasalia e.g. Trichomonas Amitochondriate flagellates, generally intestinal commensals of insects. Some human pathogens. [ Discoba or JEH clade ] Euglenozoa and Heterolobosea (Percolozoa) appear to be particularly close relatives, and are united by the presence of discoid crista e within the mitochondria (Superphylum Discicristata ). More recently a close relationship has been shown between Discicristata and Jakobida, [ http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982207017162 Toward Resolving the Eukaryotic Tree: The Phylogenetic Positions of Jakobids and Cercozoans Naiara Rodr &amp; iacute;guez-Ezpeleta, Henner Brinkmann, Gertraud Burger, Andrew J.

[ Monophyly ] Excavate relationships are still uncertain; it is possible that they are not a monophyletic group. The monophyly of the excavates is far from clear, although it seems like there are several clades within the excavates which are monophyletic. [ Evaluating Support for the Current Classification of Eukaryotic Diversity Laura Wegener Parfrey, Erika Barbero, Elyse Lasser, Micah Dunthorn, Debashish Bhattacharya, David J Patterson, and Laura A Katz 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020220 PLoS Genet. December 2006 2 12 e220 17194223 1713255 ] Certain excavates are often considered among the most primitive eukaryote s, based partly on their placement in many evolutionary trees. This could encourage proposals that excavates are a paraphyletic grade that includes the ancestors of other living eukaryotes. However, the placement of certain excavates as &apos;early branches&apos; may be an analysis artifact caused by long branch attraction, as has been seen with some other groups, for example, microsporidia. [ Malawimonas ] In addition to the groups mentioned in the table above, the genus Malawimonas is generally considered to be a member of Excavata owing to its typical excavate morphology, and phylogenetic affinity to excavate groups in some molecular phylogenies. However, its position among excavates remains elusive [ December 2011 ].
