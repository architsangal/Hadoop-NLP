It has also created an official orthography of the Persian language, titled Dastur-e Xatt-e Fârsi (Persian Script Orthography). The academy also promotes research on Persian language and literature, other Iranian languages, Persian heritage, Iranian Studies and Iranian culture. Iranian law requires those equivalents to be used in all official communications of government bodies and government-owned companies, and in product names of all private companies. [ Membership ] Academy&apos;s presidents to this day have been Hassan Habibi (a previous first vice president) and Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel (the present Speaker of Parliament ). The academy members (permanent and associated) are selected from Masters of Persian literature and linguistics from Iran and other Persian speaking countries throughout the world as Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Up to 10 permanent chairs (out of 25 permanent chairs) have been devoted to non-Iranian nationals.

The announcement reads: &quot; Persian &quot; has been used in a variety of publications including cultural, scientific and diplomatic documents for centuries and, therefore, it carries a very significant historical and cultural meaning. Hence, changing &quot; Persian &quot; to &quot; Farsi &quot; would negate this established important precedent. Changing the usage from &quot; Persian &quot; to &quot; Farsi &quot; may give the impression that Farsi is a new language, although this may well be the intention of some users of &quot; Farsi &quot;. Changing the usage may also give the impression that Farsi is a dialect used in some parts of Iran rather than the predominant (and official) language of the country. The word &quot; Farsi &quot; has never been used in any research paper or university document in any Western language, and the proposal to begin using it would create doubt and ambiguity about the name of the official language of Iran. Supporting this announcement, gradually other institutions and literary figures separately took similar actions throughout the world.
