Patrick Henry County was named for Patrick Henry, and was formed in 1777. Prior to the formation of Patrick County, one of the Virginia colony&apos;s first frontier forts lay within the boundaries of what was then Halifax County on the banks of the North Mayo River. The location of Fort Mayo, now marked by a Virginia state historic marker, lies within present-day Patrick County. It was one of a number of such forts built from the Potomac River south to North Carolina, and was commanded by Captain Samuel Harris in 1756, the year in which George Washington made a tour of Fort Mayo and several other forts on the Virginia frontier. Fort Mayo was the southernmost of the Virginia frontier forts and saw action during the French and Indian War. One of Patrick County&apos;s most prominent early settlers was Col. Abraham Penn (sometimes written Abram Penn), born in 1743 in what is today Amherst County, Virginia. Penn qualified as Lieutenant in the Amherst County militia in June 1768, and led a company under Col. Andrew Lewis at the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774. { Serving under Capt. Penn during his militia service under Col. Andrew Lewis was a young } { lieutenant } { Joseph Martin, for whom } { Martinsville, Virginia was later named. } Penn later moved with his wife Ruth (née Stovall) to present-day Henry County, Virginia, where he patented lands at the later site of Beaver Creek Plantation. Penn served on the Committee of Safety for both Henry and Pittsylvania counties, and as a delegate to the Virginia General Assembly from Henry County. Eventually selling those lands to the Hairston family, Penn moved with his family a few miles farther west to what is today Patrick County, where he built his home Poplar Grove. During the American Revolution Col. Penn ordered the muster of some 300 militiamen under his command to march south to aid General Nathanael Greene at the battle of Guilford Court House, although some question whether the troops arrived in time for the fighting. { &quot; The Henry County Militia and the Battle of Guilford Courthouse: Colonel Penn&apos;s Militiamen Arrive Too Late, &quot; Guilford Courthouse National Military Park Historical Publication 05-07 } { The } { National Park Service, while conceding that tradition places the Henry County militia at the battle, claims that no documentary evidence places the unit there.
