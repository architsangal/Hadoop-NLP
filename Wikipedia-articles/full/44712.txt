[ Origins ] The modern archetype of the evil clown has unclear origins, but one of the first appearances of the concept is that of John Wayne Gacy, an American serial killer and rapist who became known as the Killer Clown after it was discovered that he performed as Pogo the Clown at children&apos;s parties and other events. [ Terry Sullivan Peter T. Maiken Killer Clown: The John Wayne Gacy Murders http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Pyrotechnic_Insanitarium.html?id%3Du71s2gNZqJoC%26amp%3Bredir_esc%3Dy Pinnacle New York City 2000 0-7860-1422-9 156783287 ] The public nature of his trial made the imprint of his character on American culture noteworthy, including his association with his clown persona. The evil clown archetype plays strongly off the sense of dislike caused by inherent elements of coulrophobia. A study by the University of Sheffield concluded &quot; that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable. &quot; [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm Health &amp; #124; Hospital clown images &apos;too scary&apos; BBC News 2008-01-15 2011-07-05 ] [ BBC News 2008-01-16 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm Why are clowns scary? Finlo Rohrer ] This may be because of the nature of clowns&apos; makeup hiding their faces, making them potential threats in disguise; as a psychology professor at California State University, Northridge stated, young children are &quot; very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face &quot;. [ http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm Trinity.edu Trinity.edu 2011-07-05 ] This natural disliking of clowns makes them effective to use in a literary or fictional context, as the antagonistic threat perceived in clowns is desirable in a villainous character. [ Interpretations ] The concept of the evil clown is related to the irrational fear of clowns, known as coulrophobia. The cultural critic Mark Dery has theorized the postmodern archetype of the evil clown in &quot; Cotton Candy Autopsy: Deconstructing Psycho-Killer Clowns &quot; (a chapter in his cultural critique The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink). [ Mark Dery The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Pyrotechnic_Insanitarium.html?id%3Du71s2gNZqJoC%26amp%3Bredir_esc%3Dy Grove Press California 1999 0-8021-3670-2 ] Tracking the image of the demented or deviant clown across popular culture, Dery analyzes the &quot; Pogo the Clown &quot; persona of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy; the obscene clowns of the neo- situationist Cacophony Society; the Joker (of &quot; Batman &quot; Fame); the grotesque art of R.K. Sloane; the sick-funny Bobcat Goldthwaite comedy Shakes the Clown; and Stephen King &apos;s It. Using Mikhail Bakhtin &apos;s theory of the carnivalesque, Jungian and historical writings on the images of the fool in myth and history, and ruminations on the mingling of ecstasy and dread in the Information Age, Dery asserts the evil clown is an icon of our times. Clowns are often depicted as murderous psychopath s at many American haunted houses. Wolfgang M. Zucker points out the similarities between a clown&apos;s appearance and the cultural depictions of demons and other infernal creatures, noting &quot; [the clown&apos;s] chalk-white face in which the eyes almost disappear, while the mouth is enlargedto a ghoulish bigness looks like the mask of death. &quot;.
