( Bloomsburg, in Columbia County, was incorporated as a town in 1870, and is recognized by these same publications as &quot; the only incorporated town &quot; in Pennsylvania.) Still, like all home rule municipalities in Pennsylvania, the Town of McCandless is not governed under the provisions of Pennsylvania&apos;s Township Code. McCandless is part of the North Allegheny School District and participates in the multi-municipality Northland Public Library. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of [ 16.6 sqmi ], of which [ 16.5 sqmi ] is land and [ 0.1 sqmi ], or 0.66%, is water. The municipality lies on the Allegheny Plateau and is characterized by generally hilly terrain. A floodplain lies in the area of Pine Creek, which cuts a deep valley through the central portion of the township. McCandless is bordered by Pine Township to the north and Hampton Township to the east. The southern border is Ross Township and the western border is Franklin Park borough. [ History ] [ September 2009 ] Native American artifacts, primarily Iroquois Nation, have been found in areas of the township. Early written history includes a visit by George Washington in 1753. The first settler in McCandless was James Duff, who had purchased [ 400 acre km2 ] in 1796. Farming increased in the area, and in 1849, meetings were held, presided over by Daniel Vogel, for the purpose of forming a local government. The township was originally founded in 1851 and called Taylor. The area was incorporated in 1857 as a Second Class Township and renamed McCandless in honor of District Judge Wilson McCandless. The published population was 1,482 persons. During the 1800s McCandless was primarily a farming community. During the War of 1812, an important supply route for the transportation of war materials from Pittsburgh to Commodore Perry&apos;s forces on Lake Erie passed through the area. In 1908 an interurban commuter railroad, the Harmony Line, allowed area residents to easily commute to Pittsburgh. A concurrent oil boom resulted in rapid early development, centered around the rail stations in the Highland and Ingomar areas. By 1931, the Harmony Line had been replaced by the popularity of the automobile. Allegheny County Commissioner E. V. Babcock initiated the establishment of Allegheny County&apos;s North Park. He purchased the land and later sold it to the county at cost. North Park was founded in 1927 by Allegheny County. Approximately [ 1600 acre km2 ] of the park, [ 2.5 sqmi km2 ], are located in McCandless. This area represents approximately 15.2% of the town. Between 1930-1950, the town more than doubled its population (from 2,653 to 6,488). By 1960, the population had redoubled (14,582) and has since doubled again. At the 2000 census, the number of households in the town was 11,159. Expanding population and traffic brought more diversified development into the area. McKnight Road was built in the mid 1950s and became the primary access into the north suburban areas. Retail and office uses occupy some of the McCandless segment of the McKnight corridor.
