It includes 113,558 (2012) men and women, under Article 328 of the Bolivarian Constitution (1999), in 5 components of Ground, Sea and Air. The components of the National Armed Forces are: Venezuelan Bolivarian National Army Venezuelan Bolivarian National Navy Venezuelan Bolivarian National Air Force Venezuelan Bolivarian National Guard Venezuelan Bolivarian National Militia The main roles of the armed forces are to defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela, airspace, and islands, fight against drug trafficking, to search and rescue and, in the case of a natural disaster, civil protection. All men that are citizens of Venezuela have a constitutional duty to register for the military at the age of 18, which is the age of majority in Venezuela. [ History of the Armed Forces of Venezuela ] [ Armies of the colonial and independence periods ] The Venezuelan Armed Forces are denominated &quot; [ es Forjador de Libertades ] &quot; or &quot; Forger of Freedoms &quot;. This refers to Venezuelan armies fighting Venezuela&apos;s independence war, as well as the independence wars of five other countries, namely Colombia, Ecuador, Perú, Panamá (then part of New Granada, present day Colombia) and Bolivia. The oldest origin of an organized and professional army, as we know it today, dates back to the Spanish troops quartered in the former Province of Venezuela, in the 18th century. Politically and militarily until the creation of the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777, the Province of Venezuela depended on the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo (in today&apos;s Dominican Republic) or the Viceroyalty of New Granada (today, Colombia). In 1732 the Spanish crown created a Military Directorate and established a number of battalions, and had a few units from infantry regiments based in Spain. Reform of the military in the colonies began a few decades later. The first squadrons of cavalry arrived from Spain in 1751. The first companies of Artillery were created two years later. Both Creole whites and blacks were allowed to enter the ranks of the artillery companies. That same year, a Fixed Caracas Battalion was established. Until the creation of this battalion, defense had been based on small colonial militia companies, which initially only accepted whites. Gradually, this racist policy yielded and the entry of mixed-race people was allowed in the militias. It was from these various units that the bulk of officer cadre which commanded patriot troops in the Venezuelan War of Independence emerged. Among them were Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda, Simón Bolívar (Bolívar&apos;s own father had been Colonel of the Militia of Aragua), the general in chief Santiago Mariño, Rafael Urdaneta, among many others. With the establishment of an independent captaincy general, the Spanish troops quartered in the province passed to the direct command of Caracas. The troops in the other provinces of the country, under the command of local governors, were overseen by the Captain General of Caracas. In this way a series of autonomous units was created. Already in the early 19th century, many of these Venezuelan officials began to arrive in the country after participating in military campaigns abroad in the War of American Independence, the French Revolution, or after completing their studies in Europe. With them came a number of mercenaries of many different nationalities English, Scottish, Irish, French, German, Brazilian, Poles, Russians, and others. It could be said that in the first two decades of the 19th century, the nascent Liberation Army, was in the midst of the intellectual training of their military cadres, in various attempts to unleash the revolutionary war, and trying to build a modern army. In the midst of that task the generalissimo Francisco de Miranda, and the Liberator Simón Bolívar, who calls for immediate action. Bolívar surprised his military colleagues, when he rejected part of the Napoleonic military assumptions, habits and behaviors, takes more British soldiers, and even through third parties requested the assistance of the British Crown. And made no mistake: the 19th century, ultimately, was dominated by British and Prussian military influences. Once in battle, Bolívar began to develop his own tactics, military strategies and practices, whose legacy reaches us today. [ National period ] Contrary to what has been written, in the second half of the 19th century, the regular army never turned off, and while the development was stubbornly slow, did not ever stop, evidence of this is the continuation during that time of a school for officers (Military Academy of Mathematics, which was decades in advance of the policy of unification of arms and services of the Spanish military academy, which was in fact posterior to the Venezuelan one), a standing Army, weapons, and creating new services including the Corps of Sappers. This phase of the Venezuelan Army, is marked by infighting and a domain of local militias with no training. The little outside help in military matters at this stage is limited to the English. The military figures (there were other political figures) of the Army&apos;s most important at this stage are: Marshal Juan Crisóstomo Falcón, General in Chief Cipriano Castro, Brigadier General Ezequiel Zamora and Manuel Ezequiel Bruzual. Already in the first half of the 20th century, is the political figure of General in Chief Juan Vicente Gómez, who originally based on the plans of General in Chief Cipriano Castro, began a thorough modernization in the Army, but does not create a new army as Some historians point out. This modernization with the help of instructors and advisers from Chile, France, Italy and Germany. Interestingly, the late Prussian influence, doesn&apos;t reach the Venezuelan Army from the Germans, but from the Chileans.One of the most important reforms undertaken during the Gómez regime of the National Armed Forces, which began in 1910 with the aim of making the national army in a uniform, modern and technically advanced. The reform coincided with the centennial anniversary of the main homelands, which contributes to the doctrinal and political cohesion of the army. The most important milestones of this reform were: In 1910, operation of the Military Academy of Venezuela that was formed in 1903 started, and within it, the Nautical School (then called Naval School of Venezuela), establishing the School of Application for Military officers in active service with the aim of upgrading their military expertise. In 1913 the Superior Technical Office responsible for the development of military doctrine, organization and training of the army, was founded. In 1920 the School of Military Aviation of Venezuela was established. It is located in Maracay and was inaugurated the first of January of the next year. In 1923/1930 a new Code of Military law was adopted that superseded all previous military laws and responded to the new political and military situation in the country. This process was accompanied by the modernization of the infrastructure, provision of arms, equipment, uniforms and a sustained growth of the military budget, which was made possible by oil revenues. The reform had a strong German influence. This is due mainly to the fact the Prussian army was the most modern of the era and in this sense become a model internationally. The most important political consequence of this reform was the military defeat and political caudillismo, converted in 1913 after anti-gomecism. Since 1914 Gomez always retained the post of commander in chief of the Army, even when not holding the presidency of the Republic. The power base of support of the regime after 1913, apart from the yellow liberals and nationalists, was the military, which becomes an essential element of repression to ensure public order and national progress. At this stage the military and political figures more relevant (apart from the general Gómez himself), were the General in Chief Eleazar López Contreras and Division General Isaías Medina Angarita. The second half of the 20th century, was just as turbulent for the Army, but it was projected into the future as a modern force, though not yet cohesive. Already under the government of Division General Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the American influence (cultural, political and military) became more prominent then in the entire history of the army. So jealous of the Venezuelan Army, over the subsequent decades, he kept a precarious existing French influence, as a balance to the overwhelming American influence. Between the years 1945 and 1952, there was a major program of military equipment purchases almost monopolized by the United States (although other military material was acquired from other sources). And again in the early years of the decade of the&apos;70s, albeit in a more balanced way by their countries of origin. The new Army of the 21st century, was born again under a turbulent internal and external picture for the nation. But in a relatively short time it has undergone significant changes, including its name (from National Armed Forces to Bolivarian National Armed Force) to its doctrines, switching from a non-political position to one that defends socialism and the bolivarian revolution itself. This change has been clearly visible by the swithover of partners and suppliers from 1999, year that marked the end of a long-standing cooperation between the National Armed Forces it´s the United States similar, to a new system of &quot; multilateral alliances &quot; with the Russian Federation as the biggest of those allies.

[ Ministry of Defense ] [ Venezuelan Ministry of Defense ] Ministry of Defense in Caracas. The Venezuelan Ministry of the Popular Participation for the Defense is the federal-level organ responsible for maintaining the Venezuelan armed forces. As of January 2012, this ministry is headed by Henry Rangel Silva, after the former minister and vice president of the nation resigned under controversial circumstances. The ministry coordinates numerous counter-narcotics operations, helps ready numerous civil guard initiatives, and general oversees the conventional military capabilities of Venezuela. The current minister of defense is General-In-Chief Henry Rangel Silva, in concurrent capacity as Commander, Operational Strategic Command. [ High Command and the High Council of the FAN ] He is assisted in his functions by the Military High Command of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which consists of the Minister of Defense who is an officer of the armed forces with the rank of general or admiral in chief (which is the only officer who holds this rank in the armed forces), the Chief of the Defense Inspectorate General, the Chief of the Strategic Operational Command, Major General of the Army, the Commander General of the Navy, the Commander General of the Air Force, the Commander General of the National Guard, and the Chief of the General Command of the National Reserve and National Mobilization (LOFAN Art. 42).

[ Operational Strategic Command ] The Operational Strategic Command (CEOFAN) is the highest organ of programming, planning, management, implementation and strategic joint operational control of the National Armed Forces, with jurisdiction over the entire geographical area of the Nation and in mainland areas, water and space, according to treaties signed and ratified by the Republic. This organization is supported legally by the current Article 60 of the Organic Law of the National Armed Forces (LOFAN). This body was called by the Law of Armed Forces LOFAN: CUFAN (Unified Command of the Armed Forces). The leadership of this organ is held by a major general or rear admiral of a component of the FAN. Basically the Operational Strategic Command (CEO) is the body responsible for coordinating the action of military units belonging to different components of the Armed Forces, for example, an air war, where they participate Army battalions, groups of aviation and air support units from the Navy, National Guard or the reserve, would be coordinated by the CEO. Its current commander is General in Chief Henry Rangel Silva { http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.venezuela/2010-07/msg00162.html } The newly created military regions, are subordinate to the OSC, NBAF. [ Military Regions ] The Integral Strategic Defense Regions (REDI, Regiones Estrategicas de Defensa Integral), were activated recently, on 13 September 2008, in compliance with the provisions of the new Organic Law of the National Armed Forces.

Each component has its own command and general staff, logistical structures and training schools, with the exception of the Reserve, which is fed by tables of NCO, sergeants and officers previously trained in other branches, but it has its own training centers, and has initiated special courses for training officers. About 83,000 soldiers were integrated in the military through a fifth service branch, the Armed Reserve, although some of this force is more of a militia than a formal, professional armed corps. [ March 2009 ]. In 2006 the FAN was transformed into six service branches, the Army, Navy, Air Force, National Guard, National Reserve and the Territorial Guard. The Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard will serve under the Strategic Operational Command ( [ es Comando Estratégico Operacional ] ), the National Reserve and the Territorial Guard will serve under the National Reserve and Mobilization Command ( [ es Comando General de la Reserva Nacional y Movilizacion Nacional ] ) [ Army ] [ Army of Venezuela ] The Venezuelan Army ( [ es Fuerzas Terrestres ] or [ es Ejército ] ), is made up today of roughly 63,000 troops (including conscripts). Its main function is planning, implementing and monitoring terrestrial military operations in coordination with the other components of the national armed forces, in pursuit of the Integrated Defense of the Nation. Currently, it is organized in six operating divisions: an Army Aviation Command, The Army Corps of Engineers, The Logistics Command, and Military Schools. It is a modern and disciplined army, composed of armored units, infantry, engineers and artillery, with a significant force projection power, and resources that allows to develop various types of airlift operations proportional to its size. Its current commander is Major General Euclides Campos. { http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.venezuela/2010-07/msg00162.html } { http://www.mindefensa.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content &amp; task=view &amp; id=465 &amp; Itemid=245 } [ Navy ] [ Bolivarian Armada of Venezuela ] [ Venezuelan Marine Corps ] Venezuelan Frigates The Venezuelan Navy ( [ es Fuerzas Navales ] or [ es Armada ] ) and Marines (Infanteria de Marina) is a modern navy of medium dimensions and ocean capable. The primary mission of the Navy is to implement, manage and control naval operations, naval aircraft, and the Coast Guard in support of Navy activities to ensure the execution of plans of employment.

Operationally, the country is divided into two Naval zones; Western Naval Zone (HQ: Punto Fijo) and Eastern Naval Area (HQ: Carupano) that currently covers the Atlantic coast. The activation of the projected areas: Central Naval Area (HQ: Puerto Cabello), Atlantic (HQ: Güiria) and South (HQ: Caicara Orinoco) is cureently in the planning stage. Its commander is Admiral Diego Alfredo Molero Bellavia. [ Air Force ] [ Venezuela Air Force ] The Venezuelan Air Force ( [ es Fuerzas Aéreas ] or [ es Aviación ] ), at the present time, is one of the most modern air forces in Latin America. It was organized the same as the other military components, namely: Air Operations Command (integrated in twelve Air Groups, consisting of regiments of transport aircraft, helicopters and fighter aircraft), the Command of Air Defense, the Command of Airborne Troops, the Logistics Command, and the Command of Personnel. Its main objective is to protect the airspace of Venezuela in coordination with the other components of the National Armed Forces, and to participate actively in the development of the nation. In 2007, the Air Force was renamed as The Bolivarian Military Air force of Venezuela. Its commander is Major General José Gregorio Pérez Escalona. [ National Guard ] [ Venezuelan National Guard ] The National Guard of Venezuela ( [ es Fuerzas Armadas de Cooperacion ] or [ es Guardia Nacional ] ), according to the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, will conduct operations required for the maintenance of internal order in the country, cooperate in military operations required to ensure the defense of the Nation, exercise administrative and police activities of Criminal Investigation assigned to it by the laws, and will actively participate in national development in the territory of the nation.

A reform of the hierarchy was announced in the press. However, it has not happened to date. It was announced that the professional career non-commissioned officers (SOPC) would be known as technical officer. It was also adopted in the new law LOFANB, in which the rank of Major General came after Division General and General in Chief. In the Navy, the Admiral in Chief rank would be equivalent to General in Chief. Article 62 of the Organic Law of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces has the full order of ranks of military officers, and their equivalents in the Navy, while Article 63 of the Organic Law provides the full military hierarchy of professional troops.Article 69 of the Organic Law provides the military hierarchy of the enlisted personnel of the National Armed Forces. [ Berets ] Beret s are worn by some units in the National Armed Forces, with distinctive colors for some units or functions.

Russia has been the main supplier of weapons to Venezuela. [ Arms purchases from 2005-2009 ] The Venezuelan government has embarked on a massive military modernization and purchases that greatly expand their defensive and offensive capabilities, including negotiations for German submarines and transport aircraft, several agreements with Russia (outlined below), transport aircraft and naval vessels from Spain, radars from China, home-made and designed armored light vehicles and rocket launchers, studies for Russian main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, amongst many others. Most if not all European military hardware have not been delivered to Venezuela due to the U.S. embargo. [ Surveillance radars, AK-103s and helicopters: Mi-17, Mi-26 and Mi-35 ] Venezuela in 2005 acquired 3 JYL-1 long range 3D surveillance radars from China at a cost of $150 million.

Also in September Chavez confirmed that Venezuela purchased 24 K-8 Karakorum trainer jets from China. { http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=080921230912.0dszz961 &amp; show_article=1 } [ http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/09/25/afx5469679.html Forbes Venezuela expects first Chinese planes in 2009-Chavez 25 September 2008 ] The deal, which is estimated to be worth between $72–$84 million, was the biggest Venezuelan arms deal of 2008. On the 21 of July 2010, one Chinese K-8 light jet went down. Pilot and assistant ejected. Venezuela has acquired an undisclosed number of SA-24 Igla-S man-portable surface to air missiles. [ http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/07/28/venezuela.colombia/index.html CNN Venezuela freezes relations with Colombia - CNN.com 19 May 2010 29 July 2009 ] The SA-24 Igla-S is the most advanced version built in Russia. { http://www.miamiherald.com/news/americas/story/1073994.html } This acquisition was only confirmed after 50 SA-24 Igla-S were paraded by soldiers in Caracas in April 2009. In reaction to the acquisition the US State Department declared: &quot; We are concerned about Venezuelan arms purchases that exceed its needs and are therefore potentially destabilizing &quot;. In September 2009 Russia agreed to loan Venezuela over $2 billion to finance the purchase of weapons including tanks and advanced anti-aircraft missiles. It was stated that because of lower crude prices, the country needed to borrow the money for defence spending to avoid cuts in education and health. The deal includes orders for 92 T-72 tanks and the Buk-M2, S-125 Neva/Pechora missile system and S-300 air-defence systems and also the BM-30 Smerch rocket artillery system. President Hugo Chavez stated that &quot; Venezuela has no plans to invade anybody, or to be aggressive towards anybody, &quot; and &quot; with these rockets it&apos;s going to be very difficult for foreign planes to come and bomb us &quot;. Chavez repeated Venezuela&apos;s commitment to developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes with the help of Russia and reiterated his strong opposition to nuclear weapons. { http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/09/200991493243497426.html } [ Controversy with the United States ] These acquisitions and other projects have been greeted with criticism from the United States, which opposes the government of President Hugo Chávez. The U.S. accuses Venezuela of starting an arms race, which they claim will destabilize the military equilibrium in South America. Venezuela is also accused of supplying small arms to neighboring Colombian guerrilla organizations including FARC, which is sympathetic to Chávez. { http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031006/6venezuela_3.htm } [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/venezuela/story/0%2C12716%2C1396985%2C00.htm The Guardian London Chávez &apos;funding turmoil across Bolivia&apos; 24 January 2005 19 May 2010 Alfonso Daniels ] United States criticism is met with skepticism by Venezuelan authorities, who claim the weapons are needed to update the basic equipment in the armed forces. In some cases, Venezuelan armaments like the FN FAL have been in service more than 50 years. The government also claims that the U.S. has been the one to initiate arms races and de-stabilize countries by supplying subversive groups in Latin America throughout the past century (referring to the Cold War and the contra affair, among numerous other incidents). In the 1990s Venezuela requested a batch of F-16C/Ds to update its F-16 fighter fleet, but the U.S. government blocked the request. { AirToAirCombat.Com: F-16C Fighting Falcon LockheedMartin F-16 Origins } In October 1997 the U.S. government approved the sale of the two crash replacement F-16s, but subsequently halted the sale. { F-16 Air Forces - Venezuela } In 2005 a contract with Israel Aircraft Industries to upgrade Venezuela&apos;s F-16s was frozen following U.S. pressure. { US Roadblocks re: the Venezuela-Israel F-16 Upgrade: Politics or Protectionism? } Chavez subsequently accused the U.S. of delaying the sale of spare parts to maintain Venezuela’s F-16s. After remarks by Chavez that he would sell or lend the &apos;unused&apos; F-16&apos;s to any country that wanted them, including Iran, the U.S. Government agreed to supply the spare parts; however, the shipment was detained at the Customs Office in Maiquetia International Airport due to security concerns. { World/ReadArticle.Asp | 15 August 2007 | Global News For The Digital World } [ March 2008 ] Russia has agreed to sell more than $4 billion (£2 billion) worth of armaments to Venezuela since 2005 and disclosed that Mr Chávez wanted new antiaircraft systems and more fighter jets. { 23 September 2008 | Russia engages in &apos;gangland&apos; diplomacy as it sends warship to the Caribbean | TimesOnline } [ U.S. military embargo ] In May 2006, the government of the United States announced an embargo of military material and equipments to Venezuela; no American-made weapons or technology can be sold to Venezuela by any country or company. { EEUU decreta un embargo de armas contra Venezuela } This embargo has harmed several Venezuelan purchases, as not only are U.S. technology goods unavailable, but other nations friendly to the U.S. have been pressured to block sales of arms to Venezuela, as well. This is also considered one of the reasons Venezuela has turned to Russia and China for arms, in a move reminiscent of the Cold War. In 2005 Venezuela signed agreements with Spain to procure 12 naval transport and reconnaissance aircraft and eight naval patrol vessel s. The deal is worth $1.5-2 billion dollars to the Spanish defense industry, as well as an estimated 900 new jobs, but was cancelled due to the U.S. embargo. The cancellation does not affect the eight naval patrol vessel s. Below is a list of acquisitions frustrated directly or indirectly by the U.S. embargo: { www.fav-club.com } [ Czech Republic ] [ Sweden ] [ Spain ] [ Brazil ] [ France ] [ Russia ] Aero L-159 Alca Jets from the Czech Republic: the Czech government forbade Aero Vodochody, the manufacturer, from creating a variant with French avionics and Ukrainian engines, specially requested by Venezuela. Saab AB, a Swedish arms company announced it would honor the U.S. embargo, and would not sell arms to Venezuela. Carl Gustav recoilless rifle s, AT4 AT weapons, as well as RBS-70 AA systems are in service in the Venezuelan military. Spanish company EADS CASA halted the sale of several transport planes that contained extensive U.S. technology. Brazil was forced to cancel the sale of Embraer Super Tucano airplanes to the Venezuelan Air Force due to its use of Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. Embraer was also forced to cancel the sale of AEW &amp; C equipped planes. France decided to block the sale of Scorpène class submarine s to Venezuela. Russian companies Rosoboronexport and Sukhoi have been sanctioned by the U.S. government for procuring arms for Venezuela.
