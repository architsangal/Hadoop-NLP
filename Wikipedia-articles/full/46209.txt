After his father&apos;s death in 1516, the minor Louis II ascended to the thrones of Hungary and Bohemia. Upon his father&apos;s death Louis had been adopted by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in 1515. When Maximilian I died in 1519, Louis was raised by his legal guardian, his cousin Georg von Hohenzollern, margrave of Brandenburg - Ansbach. [ Reign ] right Louis owed allegiance to the Imperial Habsburgs as a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In 1522 Louis II was married to Mary of Habsburg, a Habsburg princess, granddaughter of Maximilian I, as stipulated by the First Congress of Vienna in 1515. His sister Anne was married to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, then a governor on behalf of his brother Charles V, and later Emperor Ferdinand I. On 29 August 1526, Louis led his forces against Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire in the disastrous Battle of Mohács. During the retreat, the nineteen-year-old king died in a marsh.

[ Jagiellons in natural line ] Statue of Louis II of Hungary in Mohács Although Louis II&apos;s marriage remained childless, he probably had an illegitimate child with his mother&apos;s former lady-in-waiting, Angelitha Wass before his marriage. This son was called John (János in Hungarian ). This name appears in sources in Vienna as either János Wass or János Lanthos. The former surname is his mother&apos;s maiden name. The latter surname may refer to his occupation. &quot; Lanthos &quot; means &quot; lutenist &quot;, or &quot; bard &quot;. He received incomes from the Royal Treasury regularly. He had further offspring. [ Names in other languages ] Coin of Louis II of Hungary with the inscription in Latin: &quot; Louis by the grace of God King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia &quot; [ II.
