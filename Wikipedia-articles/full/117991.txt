[ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of [ 137.4 sqmi km2 ], of which [ 134.1 sqmi km2 ] is land and [ 3.2 sqmi km2 ], or 2.36%, is water. At a roadside park, approximately [ 3 mi 0 ] east of Naubinway at [ 46 05 50 N 85 23 51 W ], [ 2359901 Naubinway Rest Area ] a historical marker was erected in 1965 to commemorate the northernmost point of Lake Michigan, which is located approximately [ 1 mi ] west of the park. This point is significant because it marked the original western boundary of Michigan Territory as established by the U.S. Congress in 1805. The boundary ran through the center of Lake Michigan to the northernmost extremity, and from thence due north to the northern boundary of the United States. In 1818, the boundary was extended west to the Mississippi River to encompass all the territory of the original Northwest Territory that had not yet been admitted as a state of the Union. { Northernmost Point of Lake Michigan, Michigan Historical Markers } [ History ] [ The early years ] Although the first white man may have passed through the Naubinway and Engadine area, perhaps as early as 1640, the area&apos;s recorded history did not begin until some 200 years later. The first permanent settlers to the area, the William Boucher family, came from Mackinac Island to trade furs with the Ojibwa y Indians. They built their first house on the &quot; Point &quot; (near the location of the new Naubinway Marina) and remained until approximately 1857. [ April 2008 ] It was not until March 10, 1873, that William Boucher received a deed from the federal government to [ 27.30 acre m2 ] of land in Naubinway. His deed was signed by President Ulysses S Grant, and under the provisions of the Public Land Act of 1820, he could have paid as little as $1.25 per acre. In the sale Boucher obtained the title to &quot; The lot numbered Four of Section twenty-eight in Township forty-tree of Range Nine west...subject to sale at Marquette, MI. &quot; [ April 2008 ] [ Commercial fishing ] There is a tendency to believe that commercial fishing arrived on the scene in the nick of time to save the people in Naubinway from an economic plight brought about when the lumber industry collapsed. In fact, both industries existed simultaneously, for as far back as the late 1880s 34 fishing tugs operated out of Naubinway.
