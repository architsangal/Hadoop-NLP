The history of Moldova can be traced to the 1350s, when the Principality of Moldavia, the medieval precursor of modern Moldova and Romania, was founded. In 1812, following one of several Russian-Turkish wars, the eastern half of the principality, Bessarabia (where most of today&apos;s Moldova is located), was annexed by the Russian Empire. In 1918, Bessarabia briefly became independent as the Moldavian Democratic Republic and united with Romania. In 1940 it was annexed by the Soviet Union, joined to the Moldavian ASSR, and became the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic until the dissolution of the USSR. In 1991 the country declared independence as the Republic of Moldova. [ Prehistory ] [ Prehistory of Southeastern Europe Neolithic Revolution Cucuteni-Trypillian culture ] During prehistoric times there was a succession of cultures that flourished in the land of present-day Moldova from the end of the Ice age up through the Neolithic Age, the Copper Age, the Bronze Age, and the beginning of the Iron Age, when historical records begin to be made about the people who lived in these lands. These cultures included the Linear Pottery culture (ca. 5500–4500 BC), the Yamna culture (ca. 3600–2300 BC), and the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture (ca. 5500–2750 BC). During this period of time many innovations and advancements were made, including the practice of agriculture, animal husbandry, kiln-fired pottery, weaving, and the formation of large settlements and towns. Indeed, during the Cucuteni-Trypillian Culture, some of the settlements in this area were larger than anywhere on Earth at the time, and they predate even the earliest towns of Sumer in the Mesopotamia. The area, stretching from the Dnieper River in the east to the Iron Gate of the Danube in the west (which included the land now in Moldova), had a civilization as highly advanced as anywhere else on Earth during the Neolithic period. { Iranica Antiqua,vol. XXXVII 2002 Archeological Transformations:Crossing the Pastoral/Agricultural Bridge by Philip L. Khol } The question as to why this area did not remain at the forefront of technological and social development lies in the subsequent history of its geographical location – at the end of the mostly peaceful Neolithic period, this area became a highway for invaders from the east moving into Europe. By the time the historical written record begins to cover this area, it has already seen a number of invasions sweep over it, leaving social and political upheaval in their wake. This trend was to continue on a fairly regular basis up until the 20th century. With so much destruction, it was difficult for the residents of this area to recover from each successive invasion before encountering the next wave to wash over them. However, the few societies in this area that managed to survive for a while through these turbulent centuries left behind a culture and history that are rich and dramatic.

Between the I and VII centuries CE, the south was intermittently under the Roman, then Byzantine Empire s. Due to its strategic location on a route between Asia and Europe, Moldova was repeatedly invaded, among others, by the Goths, Huns, Avars, Magyars, Kievan Rus&apos;, Pechenegs, Cumans, and the Mongols. The First Bulgarian Empire and the colonists of the Genoa Republic also left a trace in this region. [ Principality of Moldavia ] { Stephen the Great and } { Căpriana monastery } [ Moldavia ] The medieval Principality of Moldavia was established in 1359 and covered the so-called Carpathian – Danube – Dniester area, stretching from Transylvania in the west to the Dniester River in the east. { Soldier Khan, Mike Bennighof, Ph.D. } Its territory comprised the present-day territory of the Republic of Moldova, the eastern 8 of the 41 counties of Romania (a region still called Moldova by the local population), the Chernivtsi oblast and Budjak region of Ukraine. Its nucleus was in the northwestern part, the Ţara de Sus ( &quot; Upper Land &quot; ), part of which later became known as Bukovina. The name of the principality originates from the Moldova River. { Moldavia and the modern boundaries‎ } The foundation of Moldavia is attributed to the Vlach noblemen Dragoş of Bedeu, from Maramureş, who had been ordered in 1343 (1345 according to other sources) by the Hungarian king Louis of Anjou to establish a defense for the historic Kingdom of Hungary against the Tatars, and Bogdan I of Cuhea, Maramureş, who became the first independent prince of Moldavia, when he rejected Hungarian authority in 1359. The greatest Moldavian personality was prince Stephen the Great, who ruled from 1457 to 1504. { Soroca in the 1780s } Stephen III was succeeded by increasingly weaker princes, and in 1538 Moldavia became a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, to which it owed a percentage of the internal revenue, that in time rose to 10%. Moldavia was forbidden to have foreign relations to the detriment of the Ottoman Empire (although at times the country managed to circumvent this interdiction), but was allowed internal autonomy, including sole authority over foreign trade. Turks were legally forbidden to own land or build religious establishments in Moldavia. Prince Vasile Lupu had secured the Moldavian throne in 1634 after a series of complicated intrigues, and managed to hold it for twenty years. Lupu was a capable administrator and a brilliant financier, and soon was the richest man in the Christian East. Judiciously placed gifts kept him on good terms with the Ottoman authorities. { For Basil Lupul see N.Norga &quot; Byzance après Byzance &quot;, pp. 163–81 } { see Steven Runciman. &quot; The Great Church in captivity &quot; Edition 3, 1985 pp. 286–7, 341–3, 370 } In the 18th century, the territory of Moldavia often became a transit or war zone during conflicts between the Ottomans, Austrians, and Russians. In 1774, following a victory in a war against the Ottomans, Russia became a protector of the Christian Moldavia, still a vassal of the Ottoman Empire at the time. [ A brief history of the late Ottoman empire Hanioğlu Şükrü 2008 Princeton University Press 0-691-13452-9 7 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DnK5ZDKf3JgkC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA7 ] In 1775, the Habsburg Monarchy annexed ca 11% of the territory of Moldavia, which became known as Bukovina. By the Treaty of Bucharest following the Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812), Russia has annexed further 50% of its territory, which became known as Bessarabia. [ Part of the Russian Empire ] { Gubernya of Bessarabia, 1883 } [ Bessarabia Governorate ] With the notable exception of Transnistria, the territory of today&apos;s Republic of Moldova covers most of the historical region of Bessarabia. Until 1812, the term &quot; Bessarabia &quot; referred to the region between the Danube, Dniester, the Black Sea shores, and the Upper Trajan Wall, slightly larger than what today is called Budjak. By the Treaty of Bucharest of May 28, 1812 between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire — concluding the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812 — the latter annexed the eastern half of the Principality of Moldavia. [ Moldova: a Romanian province under Russian rule : diplomatic history from the archives of the great powers Mitrasca Marcel 2002 Algora Publishing 1-892941-86-4 6 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DmZogbSmBR-4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA6 ] That region was then called Bessarabia. { Mitrasca, pp. 10–11. } Initially, after being annexed by the Russian Empire, Bessarabia enjoyed a period of local autonomy until 1828. Organized as an imperial district ( oblast ), it was governed by a &quot; provisional government &quot; with two departments: a civil administration and a religious administration, the former led by the aged Moldavian boyar Scarlat Sturdza, the latter – by the metropolitan archbishop Gavriil Bănulescu-Bodoni. On top of these was the Russian military administration of Governor General Harting. However, already in 1813, the civil administration was handed to the Governor General. In 1818, reform-minded Russian tsar Alexander I passed a Settlement of the establishment of the region of Bessarabia which divided the legal power between the tsar-appointed Governor General ( Bakhmetiev ) and a 10-member High Council of the Region with 4 members appointed by the tsar and 6 elected by the local nobility. In lieu of the older 12 lands, the region was divided into 6, later 9 counties. In 1828 however, the conservative tsar Nikolai I abrogated the Settlement and passed a new regulation which endowed the Governor General with supreme power, with the regional council having only advisory functions and meeting twice a year. Article 63 of the regulation stated that all administrative personnel must know and perform their duties in Russian. Nevertheless, Romanian language would occasionally appear in documents up to 1854. { Ion Nistor, &apos;&apos;Istoria Basarabiei, 4th edition, Cartea moldovenească, Chişinău, 1991, p. 179-189 } At the end of the Crimean War, in 1856, by the Treaty of Paris, three districts of southern Bessarabia (including a part of Budjak ) – Cahul, Bolgrad and Ismail – were returned to Moldavia, and Russia lost access to the Danube river. In 1859, the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia united and formed the Romanian United Principalities, a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. In 1870, the institution of zemstva was instated in the Bessarabian oblast. Cities, communes, counties, and the entire region would elect each a local council representing noblemen, merchants and peasants. They had substantial authority in economic and sanitary areas, including roads, posts, food, public safety. On the other hand, political (including justice courts of all levels) and cultural matters remained an exclusive domain of the Governor General and were used as a vehicle of Russification. With the accomplishment of these introductions, in 1871, Bessarabia was transformed into a governorate. { Ion Nistor, p.190-191 } The defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War 1877–1878 and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Berlin granted independence to Romania. Although the treaty of alliance between Romania and Russia specified that Russia would defend the territorial integrity of Romania and not claim any part of Romania at the end of the war, the southern part of Bessarabia was re-annexed to Russia. In exchange, Romania was given Dobruja, which was at the time part of the Ottoman Empire. { Mitrasca, p. 23. } { Măzărache Church in the 19th century } Public education was entrusted to the religious establishment of the region, which since 1821 had only Russian archbishops. Dimitrie Sulima (Archbishop in 1821–1855), and Antonie Shokotov (1855–1871) allowed the parallel usage of both Romanian and Russian in church, and did not take any measures to infringe upon the linguistic specifics of the region. With the appointment of Pavel Lebedev (1871–1882), the situation changed radically, and the language of the locals was soon purged from the church. To prevent the printing of religious literature in Romanian, Lebedev closed down the printing press in Chişinău, collected from the region and burned the already printed books in Romanian (in Slavonic Cyrillic alphabet). The following archbishops Sergey Lapidevsky, Isakyi Polozensky, Neofit Novodchikov eased some of Lebedev&apos;s measures to help quell the serious dissatisfaction of the population. The next Archbishop Iakov Pyatnitsky (1898–1904) discovered that his desire to popularize a Christian culture and a moral education faced a language barrier, and in 1900 convinced the Russian High Synod to allow the publication of religious pamphlets in Romanian, while his follower Archbishop Vladimir allowed the printing of books, and from 1908 even of a regular religious journal &quot; Luminătorul &quot; by Constantin Popovici and Gurie Grosu. The last Russian Archbishops, Serafim Chichyagov (1908–1914), Platon (1914–1915) and Atanasy (1915–1918) tried to preserve the privileged status of the Russian language in the church in Bessarabia, but did not introduce any new anti-Romanian measures. Left by the last Russian Archbishop on June 23, 1918, the archbishopric was entrusted to the Bishop Nicodem de Huşi from Romania, who appointed a local Archbishop Dionisie Erhan. Then the Clerical Congress on February 21, 1920 elected Gurie Botoşăneanu as the highest church official in Bessarabia, which afterwards was restored from Archbishop to Metropolitan. { Ion Nistor, p. 224-244 } { Gavriil Bănulescu-Bodoni } Under the protection of Gavriil Bănulescu-Bodoni and Dimitrie Sulima a theological school and a seminary were opened in Chişinău, and public schools throughout the region: in the cities of Chişinău, Hotin, Cetatea Albă, Briceni, Bender, Bălţi, Cahul, Soroca, Orhei, at the monasteries of Dobruşa and Hârjauca, and even in several villages (Rezeni, Mereni, Volcineţ, Nisporeni, Hârtop). In 1835, the tsarist authorities declared a 7-year deadline to transfer the education from Romanian to Russian. Although the measure was implemented more gradually, since 1867, Romanian was purged entirely from the education. This had the effect of keeping the peasant population of Bessarabia backward, as witnessed by the fact that in 1912 Moldavians had a literacy rate of only 10.5%, lowest among all ethnic groups of the region (63% for Bessarabian Germans, 50% for Bessarabian Jews, 40% for Russians, 31% for Bessarabian Bulgarians ), with a record low 1.7% literacy rate for Moldavian women. Of the 1709 primary schools in Bessarabia in 1912, none was in the language of the main ethnic group. { Ion Nistor, p. 249-255 } During 1812–1914, a series of colonizations were made in Bessarabia by the Russian authorities. German colonists from Switzerland (canton Lausanne ), France, and Germany ( Württemberg ) settled in 27 localities (most newly settled) in Budjak, and by 1856 Bessarabian Germans were 42,216. Russian veterans of the 1828–1829 war with the Ottomans were settled in 10 localities in Budjak, and three other localities were settled by Cossacks from Dobrudja (which got there from the Dniepr region some 50 years earlier). Bessarabian Bulgarians and Gagauz arrived from modern eastern Bulgaria as early as the second half of the 18th century. In 1817, they numbered 482 families in 12 localities, in 1856 – 115,000 people in 43 localities. The above settlements were performed under the supervision of the Tsarist authorities. Ukrainians had arrived Bessarabia since before 1812, and already in 1820s they made up one third of the population of the most northern Hotin county. In the following decades more Ukrainians settled throughout the northern part of Bessarabia from Galicia and Podolia. Jews from Galicia, Podolia and Poland also settled in Bessarabia in the 19th century, but mostly in the cities and fairs; in some of these they eventually became a plurality. In 1856, there were 78,751 Bessarabian Jews. There was even an attempt by the Russian authorities to create 16 Jewish agricultural colonies, where 10,589 people would settle. However within less than 2 generations, most of them sold the land to the local Moldavians and moved to the cities and fairs. { Ion Nistor, p.197-214 } { Chişinău water carrier } Upon annexation, after the expulsion of the large Nogai Tatar population of Budjak ( Little Tartary ), [ http://www.goshen.edu/mqr/pastissues/apr00staples.html Mennonite-Nogai Economic Relations, 1825–1860 ] the population of Bessarabia was predominantly Romanian. { &apos;&apos;Bessarabia&apos;&apos; by Charles Upson Clark, 1927, chapter 8 : &quot; The first Russian census after the annexation (1816) revealed a province almost solidly Romanian-of a population of about half a million, 921/2% Moldavian and Ukrainian, 11/2% Lipovans (Russian heterodox), 41/2% Jews, 1.6% other races. &quot; } The colonization of the region in the 19th century, generated by the need to better exploit the resources of the land, { Marcel Mitrasca, Moldova: A Romanian Province Under Russian Rule, Algora, 2002, ISBN 1-892941-86-4, pg. 25 } and by the absence of serfdom in Bessarabia, { Ion Nistor, Istoria Basarabiei, Cernăuţi, 1921 } lead to an increase in the Russian, Ukrainian, Lipovan, and Cossack populations in the region; this, together with a large influx of Bulgarian immigrants, saw an increase of the Slavic population to more than a fifth of the total population by 1920. { &apos;&apos;Bessarabia&apos;&apos; by Charles Upson Clark, 1927, chapter 8 : &quot; Today, the } { Bulgarians form one of the most solid elements in Southern Bessarabia, numbering (with the } { Gagauzes, i.e. Turkish-speaking Christians also from the } { Dobrudja ) nearly 150,000.

Territories where ethnic Ukrainians formed a large portion of the population (parts of Northern Bukovina and parts of Hotin, Akkerman, and Izmail ) went to Ukraine, while a small strip of Transnistria east of the Dniester with a significant (49% of inhabitants) Moldovan population was joined to the MSSR. The transfer of Bessarabia&apos;s Black Sea and Danube frontage to Ukraine insured its control by a stable Soviet republic. This transfer, along with the division of Bessarabia, was also designed to discourage future Romanian claims and irredentism. { Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000.

In 1944–53, there were numerous anti-Communist armed resistance groups active in Moldova; however the NKVD and later MGB managed to arrest, execute or deport most of them and their power base. [ September 2010 ] By participating in the 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, Romania seized the lost territories of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, as well as those of the former MASSR, and established its administration there. In occupied Transnistria, Romanian forces, working with the Germans, deported ca. 147,000 Jews from the territories of Bessarabia and Bukovina, of whom over 90,000 perished in ghettoes and concentration camps. { Comisia prezidenţială pentru alaliza dictaturii comuniste din România. Raport final. Humanitas, Bucureşti, 2008, p. 585, see also electronic version } By April 1944, successful offensives of the Red Army recaptured northern Moldavia and Transnistria, and by the end of August 1944 the entire territory was under Soviet control, with Red Army units entering Chişinău on 24 August 1944. The Paris peace treaty signed in February 1947 fixed the Romanian-Soviet border to the one established in June 1940. { Ian Sinclair, Boundaries in Daniel Bardonnet, } { Hague Academy of International Law, Le règlement pacifique des différends internationaux en Europe, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Hague, 1991, ISBN 0-7923-1573-1, p.36 } { Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, } { Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000. ISBN 0-8179-9792-X, p.91 } The territory remained part of the Soviet Union after World War II as the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. Several social and economic groups were targeted to be executed, imprisoned, and deported to Siberia due to their economic situation, political views, or ties to the former regime. Secret police struck at dissenting people and groups. Over the years, the state imposed a harsh denationalization policy toward the ethnic majority, { &quot; Interethnic Relations, Minority Rights and Security Concerns: A Four-Country Perspective &quot;, International Renaissance Foundation } while ethnic Russians and Ukrainians were encouraged to immigrate to the Moldavian SSR, especially to large cities and to Transnistria, to cover the lack of personnel in the newly-established industries. Most of these industries were built in Transnistria and around large cities, while in the rest of the republic agriculture was developed. By the late Soviet period, the urban intelligentsia and government officials were dominated mostly by ethnic Moldovans, while Russians and Ukrainians made up most of the technical and engineering specialists. { Aleksei Georgievich Arbatov, Managing Conflict in the Former Soviet Union: Russian and American Perspectives, } { MIT Press, 1997, ISBN 0-262-51093-6, p. 154-155. } { Agriculture in Moldova, 1941 } The conditions imposed during the reestablishment of Soviet rule became the basis of deep resentment toward Soviet authorities, manifested in numerous resistance movements to Soviet rule. { Tismaneanu Report, p. 755-758 } During Leonid Brezhnev &apos;s 1950–1952 tenure as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Moldavia (CPM), he was ruthless comparing to his predecessor Nicolae Coval in putting down numerous resistance groups, and issuing harsh sentences. { Tismaneanu Report, p. 758 } A wave of repression was aimed at the Romanian intellectuals who decided to remain in Moldova after the war. [ December 2008 ] During the Operation North, 723 families (2,617 persons) were deported from the Moldavian SSR, on the night of March 31 to April 1, 1951, members of neoprotestant sects, mostly Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses, qualified as religious elements considered a potential danger for the communist regime. { Comisia Prezidenţială pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din România: Raport Final / ed.: Vladimir Tismăneanu, Dorin Dobrincu, Cristian Vasile, Bucureşti: Humanitas, 2007, ISBN 978-973-50-1836-8, p. 754 } { Elena Şişcanu, Basarabia sub ergimul bolşevic (1940–1952), Bucureşti, Ed. Semne, 1998, p.111 } { Romanian Literature Museum, Chişinău } Most political and academic positions were given to members of non-Romanian ethnic groups (only 17.5% of the Moldavian SSR&apos;s political leaders were ethnic Romanians in 1940). { E.S. Lazo, Moldavskaya partiynaya organizatsia v gody stroitelstva sotsializma(1924–1940), Chisinău, Ştiinţa, 1981, p. 38 } { William Crowther, &quot; Ethnicity and Participation in the Communist Party of Moldavia &quot;, in Journal of Soviet Nationalities I, no. 1990, p. 148-49 } Although Brezhnev and other CPM first secretaries were largely successful in suppressing Romanian irredentism in 1950s–1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s administration facilitated the revival of the movement in the region. His policies of glasnost and perestroika created conditions in which national feelings could be openly expressed and in which the Soviet republics could consider reforms. { King, p. 121 } In 1970s and &apos;80s Moldova received substantial investment from the budget of the USSR to develop industrial, scientific facilities, as well as housing. In 1971 the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a decision &quot; About the measures for further development of Kishinev city &quot; that secured more than one billion rubles of funds for Chişinău alone from the USSR budget. Subsequent decisions directed large amounts of funds and brought qualified specialists from all over the USSR to further develop the Moldavian SSR. { Architecture of Chişinău on Kishinev.info, Retrieved on 2008-10-12 } Such an allocation of USSR assets was influenced by the fact that the-then leader of the Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev, was the First Secretary of the local Communist Party in the 1950s. These investments stopped in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when Moldova became independent. { Triumphal arch } [ Independence ] [ Gaining independence ] [ Independence of Moldova Declaration of Independence of Moldova ] In the climate of Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s perestroika and glasnost, national sentiment escalated in the Moldavian SSR in 1988. In 1989, the Popular Front of Moldova was formed as an association of independent cultural and political groups and gained official recognition. The Popular Front organized a number of large demonstrations, which led to the designation of Moldovan as the official language of the MSSR on August 31, 1989 and a return to the Latin alphabet. { &quot; Romanian Nationalism in the Republic of Moldova &quot; by Andrei Panici, American University in Bulgaria, 2002; pages 39–41 } However, opposition was growing to the increasingly exclusionary nationalist policies of the Popular Front, especially in Transnistria, where the Yedinstvo-Unitatea (Unity) Intermovement had been formed in 1988 by Slavic minorities, { Political Parties, Fedor, Helen, ed. Moldova: A Country Study. GPO for the } { Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., 1995 } and in the south, where the organization Gagauz Halkî (Gagauz People), formed in November 1989, came to represent the Gagauz, a Turkic-speaking minority there. The first democratic elections to the Moldavian SSR&apos;s Supreme Soviet were held on February 25, 1990. Runoff elections were held in March. The Popular Front won a majority of the votes. After the elections, Mircea Snegur, a reformed communist, was elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet; in September he became president of the republic. The reformist government that took over in May 1990 made many changes that did not please the minorities, including changing the republic&apos;s name in June from the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic to the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova and declaring it sovereign the following month. At the same time, Romanian tricolor with the Moldavian coat-of-arms was adopted as the state flag, and Deşteaptă-te române!, the Romanian anthem, became the anthem of the SSRM. During that period a Movement for unification of Romania and the Republic of Moldova became active in each country. In August 1990, following a refusal of the increasingly nationalist republican government, to grant cultural and territorial autonomy to Gagauzia and Transnistria, two regions populated primarily by ethnic minorities. In response, the Gagauz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was declared in the south, in the city of Comrat. In September in Tiraspol, the main city on the east bank of the Dniester River, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (commonly called the &quot; Dnestr Republic &quot;, later Transnistria) followed suit. The parliament of Moldova immediately declared these declarations null and void. { &quot; Ethnicity and power in the contemporary world &quot; Chapter 5, &quot; Dynamics of the Moldova Trans-Dniester ethnic conflict (late 1980s to early 1990s) &quot; – From declaring sovereignty to declaring independence, Kumar Rupesinghe and Valery A. Tishkov, United Nations University Press, 1996 } In mid-October 1990, approximately 30,000 Moldovan nationalist volunteers were sent to Gagauzia and Transnistria, where an outbreak of violence was averted by the intervention of the Soviet 14th Army. { &quot; О ПОЛОЖЕНИИ НАЦИОНАЛЬНЫХ МЕНЬШИНСТВ В РЕСПУБЛИКЕ МОЛДОВА &quot; human rights assessment by } { Memorial, May, 1992 } (The Soviet 14th Army, now the Russian 14th Army, had been headquartered in Chişinău since 1956.) However, negotiations in Moscow between the Gagauz and Transnistrian leadership, and the government of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova failed. In May 1991, the country&apos;s official name was changed to the Republic of Moldova (Republica Moldova). The name of the Supreme Soviet also was changed, to the Moldovan Parliament. During the 1991 Soviet coup d&apos;état attempt in Moscow against Mikhail Gorbachev, commanders of the Soviet Union&apos;s Southwestern Theater of Military Operations attempted to impose a state of emergency in Moldova. They were overruled by the Moldovan government, which declared its support for Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who led the counter-coup in Moscow. [ September 2010 ] On 27 August 1991, following the coup&apos;s collapse, Moldova declared its independence from the Soviet Union. The December elections of Stepan Topal and Igor Smirnov as presidents of Gagauzia and Transnistria respectively, and the official dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of the year, had further increased tensions in Moldova. { &quot; Ethnicity and power in the contemporary world &quot; Chapter 5, &quot; Dynamics of the Moldova Trans-Dniester ethnic conflict (late 1980s to early 1990s) &quot; } [ Transnistria ] [ Transnistria War of Transnistria ] { Transnistria n region of Moldova } Transnistria is the region east of the Dniester River, which includes a large proportion of predominantly Russophone ethnic Russians and Ukrainians (51%, as of 1989, with ethnic Moldovans forming a 40% minority). The headquarters of the Soviet 14th Guards Army was located in the regional capital Tiraspol. There, on September 2, 1990, local authorities proclaimed an independent Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The motives behind this move were fear of the rise of nationalism in Moldova and the country&apos;s expected reunification with Romania upon secession from the USSR. In the winter of 1991–1992 clashes occurred between Transnistrian forces and the Moldovan police. Between March 2 and July 26, 1992, the conflict escalated into a military engagement. Following an intervention of the 14th Army into the conflict on the side of the separatists, the war was stopped and the Moscow Agreement on the principles of peace settlement of armed conflict in Trans-Dniester districts of the republic of Moldova was signed on 21 July 1992. As of 2007, the Russian military remains in Transnistria, despite Russia having signed international agreements to withdraw, and against the will of Moldovan government. { Statement by H.E. Mr. Andrei Stratan at the General Debate of the Sixty Second Session of the UN General Assembly, New-York, 1 October 2007 : &quot; I would like to reiterate on this occasion the position of the Republic of Moldova according to which the withdrawal of the Russian troops that remain on the Moldovan territory against its will, in conformity with the obligations assumed by the Russian Federation in 1999 in Istanbul, would create the necessary premises for ratifying and applying the Adapted CFE Treaty. &quot; } { http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2368523 Jamestown: &quot; Moldovan President wants out of Russia&apos;s orbit &quot; } The government of Moldova continues to offer extensive autonomy to Transnistria, while the government of Transnistria demands independence. De jure, Transnistria is internationally recognized as part of Moldova, but de facto, the Moldovan government does not exercise any control over the territory. { Horia C. Matei, &quot; State lumii. Enciclopedie de istorie. &quot; Meronia, Bucureşti, 2006, p. 292-294 } [ Post-independence ] [ Post-independence of Moldova Politics of Moldova ] On December 27, 1991, Mircea Snegur, an ex-communist reformer, ran an unopposed election for the presidency. On March 2, 1992, the country achieved formal recognition as an independent state at the United Nations. { Republic of Moldova at data.un.org } In 1992, Moldova became involved in a brief conflict against local insurgents in Transnistria, who were aided by locally stationed Russian armed forces and Don Cossacks, which resulted in the failure of Moldova to regain control over the breakaway republic. Starting 1993, Moldova began to distance itself from Romania. The 1994 Constitution of Moldova used the term &quot; Moldovan language &quot; instead of &quot; Romanian &quot; and changed the national anthem to &quot; Limba noastră &quot;. On January 2, 1992, Moldova introduced a market economy, liberalizing prices, which resulted in huge inflation. From 1992 to 2001, the young country suffered its worst economic crisis, leaving most of the population below the poverty line. In 1993, a national currency, the Moldovan leu, was introduced to replace the Soviet ruble. The end of the planned economy also meant that industrial enterprises would have to buy supplies and sell their goods by themselves, and most of the management was unprepared for such a change. [ December 2008 ] Moldova&apos;s industry, especially machine building, became all but defunct, and unemployment skyrocketed. [ December 2008 ] The economic fortunes of Moldova began to change in 2001; since then the country has seen a steady annual growth of between 5% and 10%. In the early 2000s, there was also a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Russia and other countries. [ December 2008 ] Remittances from Moldovans abroad account for almost 38% of Moldova&apos;s GDP, the second-highest percentage in the world. [ http://economie.moldova.org/stiri/eng/171400/ Moldova: Information Campaign to Increase the Efficiency of Remittance Flows International Organization for Migration 10 December 2008 ] Officially, Moldova&apos;s annual GDP is on the order of $1,000 per capita; however, a significant part of the economy goes unregistered due to corruption. [ September 2010 ] The pro-nationalist governments of prime ministers Mircea Druc (May 25, 1990 – May 28, 1991), and Valeriu Muravschi (May 28, 1991 – July 1, 1992), were followed by a more moderate government of Andrei Sangheli, during which there was a decline of the pro-Romanian nationalist sentiment. { Helen Fedor, ed.. &apos;&apos;Moldova: A Country Study&apos;&apos; Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1995. } After the 1994 elections, Moldovan Parliament adopted measures that distanced Moldova from Romania. The new Moldovan Constitution also provided for autonomy for Transnistria and Gagauzia. On December 23, 1994, the Parliament of Moldova adopted a &quot; Law on the Special Legal Status of Gagauzia &quot;, and in 1995 it was constituted. { alegeri.md: &quot; About Gagauz ATU &quot; } After winning the presidential elections of 1996, on January 15, 1997, Petru Lucinschi, the former First Secretary of the Moldavian Communist Party in 1989–91, became the country&apos;s second president. After the legislative elections on March 22, 1998, the Alliance for Democracy and Reform was formed by non-Communist parties. However, the term of the new government of Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc (January 24, 1997– February 1, 1999) was marked by chronic political instability, which prevented a coherent reform program. The 1998 financial crisis in Russia, Moldova&apos;s main economic partner at the time, produced an economic crisis in the country. The standard of living plunged, with 75% of population living below the poverty line, while the economic disaster caused 600,000 people to emigrate. New governments were formed by Ion Sturza (February 19 – November 9, 1999) and Dumitru Braghiş (December 21, 1999 – April 19, 2001). On July 21, 2000, the Parliament adopted an amendment to the Constitution that transformed Moldova from a presidential to a parliamentary republic, in which the president is elected by 3/5 of the votes in the parliament, and no longer directly by the people. 2002 protests Only 3 of the 31 political parties won more than the 6% of the popular vore required to win seats in parliament in the February 25, 2001 elections. Winning 49.9% of the vote, the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (reinstituted in 1993 after being outlawed in 1991), gained 71 of the 101 parliament seats, and elected Vladimir Voronin as the country&apos;s third president on April 4, 2001. A new government was formed on April 19, 2001 by Vasile Tarlev. The country became the first post-Soviet state where a non-reformed communist party returned to power. In March–April 2002, the opposition Christian-Democratic People&apos;s Party organized a mass protest in Chişinău against the plans of the government to fulfill its electoral promise and introduce Russian as the second state language along with its compulsory study in schools. { BBC News: &quot; Forced Russian lessons spark Moldova protest &quot;, 9 January 2002 } The government annulled these plans. The relationship between Moldova and Russia deteriorated in November 2003 over a Russian proposal for the solution of the Transnistrian conflict, which Moldovan authorities refused to accept { Dr. Mihai Gribincea: &quot; Russian troops in Transnistria – a threat to the security of the Republic of Moldova &quot; } because it stipulated a 20-year Russian military presence in Moldova. The federalization plan for Moldova would have also turned Transnistria and Gagauzia into a blocking minority over all major policy matters of Moldova. As of 2006, approximately 1,200 of the 14th army personnel remain stationed in Transnistria, guarding a large ammunitions depot at Colbasna. In recent years, negotiations between the Transnistrian and Moldovan leaders have been going on under the mediation of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Russia, and Ukraine; lately observers from the European Union and the United States have become involved, creating a 5+2 format. In the wake of the November 2003 deadlock with Russia, a series of shifts in the external policy of Moldova occurred, targeted at rapprochement with the European Union. In the context of the EU&apos;s expansion to the east, Moldova wants to sign the Stability and Association Agreement. It implemented its first three-year action plan within the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) of the EU. [ http://politicom.moldova.org/stiri/eng/40/ Moldova-EU Action Plan Approved by European Commission http://www.azi.md December 14, 2004 July 2, 2007 ] [ http://ec.europa.eu/world/enp/pdf/action_plans/moldova_enp_ap_final_en.pdf EU/MOLDOVA ACTION PLAN ] In the March 2005 elections, the Party of the Communists (PCRM) won 46% of the vote, (56 of the 101 seats in the Parliament), the Democratic Moldova Block (BMD) won 28.5% of the vote (34 MPs), and the Christian Democratic People Party (PPCD) won 9.1% (11 MPs). On April 4, 2005, Vladimir Voronin was re-elected as country&apos;s president, supported by a part of the opposition, and on April 8, Vasile Tarlev was again appointed head of government. On March 31, 2008, Vasile Tarlev was replaced by Zinaida Greceanîi as head of the government. { 2009 civil unrest } Following the parliamentary elections on April 5, 2009 the Communist Party won 49.48% of the votes, followed by the Liberal Party with 13.14% of the votes, the Liberal Democratic Party with 12.43% and the Alliance &quot; Moldova Noastră &quot; with 9.77%. The opposition leaders have protested against the outcome calling it fraudulent and demanded a repeated election. A preliminary report by OSCE observers called the vote generally free and fair. However, one member of the OSCE observation team expressed concerns over that conclusion and said that she and a number of other team members feel that there had been some manipulation, but they were unable to find any proof. { BBC : &quot; Romania blamed over Moldova riots &quot;, 8 April 2009 } On April 6, 2009, several NGO s and opposition parties organized a protest in Chişinău, gathering a crowd of about 15,000 with the help of social network sites such as Twitter and Facebook. The protesters accused the Communist government of electoral fraud. Anti-communist and pro-Romanian slogans were widely used. The demonstration had spun out of control on April 7 and escalated into a riot when a part of the crowd attacked the presidential offices and broke into the parliament building, looting and setting its interior on fire. { SevenTimes.ro: &quot; Supporting actions for Moldova&apos;s riot &quot;, 08 April 2009 } { &quot; The protest initiative group: LDPM is the guilty one for the devastations in the Chişinău downtown &quot;, April 08, 2009 } Police had regained control on the night of April 8, arresting and detaining several hundred protesters.

The opposition blamed police abuse for these deaths, while the government claimed they were either unrelated to the protests, or accidents. Government officials, including President Vladimir Voronin, called the rioting a coup d&apos;état attempt and accused Romania of organizing it. The opposition accused the government of organizing the riots by introducing agents provocateurs among the protesters. In 2010, the political climate in Moldova remained unstable. The parliament failed to elect a new president. [ http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/271566%2Cmoldova-parliament-fails-to-elect-president-crisis-deepens--summary.html Moldova parliament fails to elect president, crisis deepens ] For this reason, the parliament was dissolved and new general elections were held on July 29, 2009, with the Communists again attaining a substantial, although weakened, plurality both in popular vote and in parliamentary seats. An attempt by the ruling coalition to amend the constitution of Moldova via a referendum in 2010 in order to enable presidential election by popular vote failed due to lack of turnout. The parliamentary election in November 2010 had retained the status quo between the ruling coalition and the communist opposition.
