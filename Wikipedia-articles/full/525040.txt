On September 21, 2007, Cedar Fair, the park&apos;s owner, announced that the traditional amusement park would close down and that the property would operate solely as a water park, beginning in the 2008 season. The water park is still open today as Wildwater Kingdom. [ History ] [ Pre-amusement park era ] [ Geauga Lake (Ohio) ] Geauga Lake was previously known as &quot; Picnic Lake &quot; or &quot; Giles Pond. &quot; [ Images of America: Aurora Marcelle Wilson Richard Fetzer 2007 14 978-0738550558 Arcadia Publishing ] Geauga lake area was home to early settler s such as the Staffords, Mark Patterson [ February 2012 ], Capt. Simon Henry with his wife Rhoda Parsons and their children, Charles Swires, the Brewsters, and Bohan Blair. There is currently a city park and ballfields on East Boulevard in Aurora, named after this lake. Sullivan Giles chose this area for his log cabin in 1817. He later built a large frame home on the spot behind Geauga Lake depot on the north side of the lake. When the railroad came to town in 1856, it made a stop at &quot; pond station &quot;. Giles took advantage of his scenic lake location and, in the last half of the 19th century, established picnic grounds, a dance hall, and other entertainment near his home for the all day pleasure of residents and those taking the train to the country for a getaway. Geauga Lake opened for picnics and swimming in 1872. An 1880 history of Geauga County reported that the Giles residence &quot; being easy of access by rail, has become, within a few years, a very popular place of resort during the summer months, for fishing, picnic, and excursion parties &quot; and that &quot; for the convenience of such parties, Mr. Giles has recently erected a hall of considerable size near the lake. The surrounding grounds are kept clean and attractive, and, without exception, this is the most charming place to spend a leisure day to be found in this section. &quot; [ Pioneer and General History of Geauga County 1880 Historical Society of Geauga County 143 ] At the time, a full-sized steamboat circled the lake, towing a large scow, topped with a dance floor. The boat, first owned by William Banford and Rowe Fuller, was later purchased by the Kents. In 1907, the boat was shipped by rail to Brady Lake near Kent. [ Geauga Lake amusement park ] Geauga Lake park itself was established in 1887. Three major league baseball games were played on Sundays at Geauga Lake in 1888 (plus a Thursday exhibition game) by the Cleveland Forest Citys of the major league American Association. [ The Plain Dealer July 23, 30 and August 27, 1888 ] By 1889 the park installed its first ride, a steam-powered carousel. [ Cleveland Amusement Park Memories Francis David Diane Francis 2004 978-1-886228-89-4 55 ] More rides would follow. Big Dipper from across the lake. William J. Kuhlman expanded the park in 1925. At that time, Geauga Lake built the Big Dipper, the then-largest wooden roller coaster of its time, [ 2800 ft m ] long and [ 65 ft m ] high. Geauga Lake&apos;s Olympic-sized swimming pool was built, and it stayed in operation until the mid-1960s. On Sunday, July 11, 1926 Olympic medalist and Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller set a new world record in the 220-yard free style swim in the pool in front of 3,000 spectators. [ The Plain Dealer July 12, 1926 ] Lake swimming also continued over the coming decades. Many amusement parks at the time had race tracks, dance halls, and sometimes a theatre and bowling alley, making them year round attractions. The race track was added in 1931, although it closed in 1969. The theatre, dance hall, and bowling alley were also added around the same time. In 1937 the park&apos;s 1926 hand-carved Marcus Illions Carousel was added, after having been located in Philadelphia and Birmingham, at a cost of $35,000. { Francis &amp; Francis, p. 62 } At that point, the park&apos;s dance hall and ballroom were major draws, with big band music performed by Guy Lombardo, Fred Waring, Artie Shaw, and other big names of the time. In 1942, a tornado hit the park, injuring six, destroying buildings, and damaging the Big Dipper. [ The Plain Dealer August 24, 1942 ] The park reported $50,000 in damages, but it quickly rebuilt. { Francis &amp; Francis, p. 65 } In July 1944, Viola Schryer ( &quot; Vi &quot; ) took over management of the park after the death of her uncle William Kuhlman. [ The Plain Dealer July 27, 1944 ] In 1952, a fire destroyed the park&apos;s bowling alley, theater, dance hall and roller rink with damages estimated at $500,000. { Francis &amp; Francis, p. 68 } At that time the park became strictly a seasonal amusement park, beach, and swimming area. The pool was closed and razed in the early 1960s, but lake swimming continued. In 1969, Funtime Incorporated purchased the park. The focus continued to be rides and swimming. The racetrack closed and was razed in 1969. In 1970 a marine life park, SeaWorld Ohio, was built across the lake from the amusement park and swimming area on land leased from Funtime. SeaWorld and Geauga Lake were friendly neighbors for 30 years. SeaWorld focused on marine life and shows, while Geauga Lake focused on thrill rides and swimming. SeaWorld was purchased by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1976 and later by Busch Entertainment Corp in late 1989. In 1972, the Gold Rush log flume water ride was added, and two years later Geauga Lake added the Skyscraper, which took passengers up 21 stories for views of the park. Admission to the park was free until 1972. Until then, rides on various attractions were purchased on a pay-as-you-go basis. Beginning in 1973, the park converted to an admission charge with a pay-one-price for all the rides and attractions. The Geauga Dog became the park&apos;s mascot and would remain so until 1999. In 1976, the park added the Wildcat compact steel roller coaster, and a year later the park added the Double Loop, a looping steel coaster. For a time, the park ran a short-lived series of TV commercials featuring Geauga Dog and a singing, dancing adolescent boy performing a song about the park. The boy&apos;s off-key singing and awful dancing were deliberate, a means of getting viewers to notice the ad. It succeeded. Corkscrew coaster made its debut in 1978, making Geauga Lake the second amusement park in Ohio ( Cedar Point in Sandusky was the first) and one of the first amusement parks anywhere to have two looping coasters. Swimming in the lake continued to be a feature at the park, and in 1983, the park added Boardwalk Shores, which featured a paddleboat marina, a new bath house, a children&apos;s swimming pool area and water slides. A year later, The Wave, the only authentic tsunami wave pool in the Midwest at the time, opened to rave reviews. In 1986, more children&apos;s rides were added and themed as Rainbow Island, a children&apos;s dry ride area. Stingray water slides and the Euroracer Grand Prix rides were added. In 1988, Geauga Lake celebrated its centennial by introducing the Raging Wolf Bobs, a wooden roller coaster with a hybrid twister/out and back design modeled after the original Bobs roller coaster at Chicago&apos;s defunct Riverview Park. Two years later, the park re-themed the children&apos;s water area as Turtle Beach, which was advertised as the ultimate children&apos;s water playground. Geauga Lake expanded its midway with The Mirage and the $2.1 million Texas Twister in the early 1990s. A corporate deal in 1995 saw Premier Parks acquiring Funtime, giving Geauga Lake a new owner. Premier Parks invested $9 million in new rides, including the Mind Eraser (a steel looping shuttle Boomerang roller coaster) and Grizzly Run, a water rapids ride designed by Intamin. These attractions opened in 1996, and the Corkscrew was closed and sold and moved to Dizzee World in India. The next year, the park expanded its water area by [ 32000 sqft m2 ] with Hook&apos;s Lagoon. Several new water slides were also added. In 1998, Premier Parks purchased Six Flags from Time Warner. Serial Thriller, later known as Thunderhawk, was added. The next year, Americana, Time Warp, and an up-charge attraction Skycoaster were added. Premier Parks rebranded Geauga Lake in 2000 as Six Flags Ohio. [ Six Flags era ] The logo when it was known as &apos;&apos;Six Flags Worlds of Adventure&apos;&apos; In 2000, Six Flags received $40 million in improvements, primarily four new roller coasters. One was a junior roller coaster called Road Runner Express. Others included a wooden double out and back roller coaster called Villain, a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard floorless roller coaster called Batman Knight Flight and an Intamin suspended impulse shuttle coaster called Superman Ultimate Escape. Also added this year was a new chutes water ride named Shipwreck Falls and a new wave pool in the water park. The old wave pool was razed, filled, and used for a new Looney Tunes themed kids&apos; area. Busch Entertainment determined that its SeaWorld parks should feature roller coasters, water rides, and other attractions to supplement the marine displays and shows, and the company began de-emphasizing the educational aspects of its parks. They began modifying their Orlando, San Antonio, and to a lesser extent their San Diego parks to reflect this. Due to Geauga Lake/Six Flags Ohio&apos;s close proximity, as well as the fact that the SeaWorld side of the lake had height restrictions, Busch approached Six Flags about buying the Six Flags park. Six Flags then made a counter offer to instead buy SeaWorld Ohio. That Fall, Six Flags purchased SeaWorld for $110 million in cash, merging the two complexes into one, and changing the entire complex&apos;s name to Six Flags Worlds of Adventure. The SeaWorld side became known as the &quot; Wild Life &quot; area and remained primarily marine life shows, with a few portable children&apos;s rides placed throughout. In 2002 Shamu the whale was replaced by Shouka, who came on a breeding loan from Marineland in Antibes, France. The original amusement park area became known as the &quot; Wild Rides &quot; area and continued expansion with a Vekoma flying coaster titled X-Flight (now Firehawk at Kings Island ). The small water park area also continued, so the park was marketed as &quot; Three Parks for One Price &quot;. To expand the water park area, in 2003 Six Flags added Hurricane Mountain, the then-largest water slide complex in North America, and renamed the water park area Hurricane Harbor. [ Cedar Fair era ] View of &apos;&apos;Thunderhawk&apos;&apos; (yellow), &apos;&apos;Dominator&apos;&apos; (blue), and &apos;&apos;Raging Wolf Bobs&apos;&apos; (white) with the ferry boats (then unused) in the background in 2006 Facing financial difficulties across its chain and high debt, Six Flags considered selling the park. Two months before the 2004 season, a sale to Cedar Fair, owner of Cedar Point located [ 85 mi km ] away, was announced. The deal was finalized less than a month later. The park was immediately &quot; unflagged &quot;, &quot; unbranded &quot;, and reverted to the name Geauga Lake. The Six Flags Looney Tunes characters and superhero branding was removed. To conform with copyright laws, the names of many of the rides and roller coasters were changed. The Hurricane Harbor water park area was renamed Hurricane Hannah&apos;s Waterpark and the marine life side was shut down immediately before opening. The animals were retained by Six Flags. While most of the marine area was razed, the amusement park area attractions and rides remained the same except for name changes. In 2005, Cedar Fair invested $26 million dollars in Wildwater Kingdom, a new water park on the former SeaWorld site, which resulted in the name being altered slightly to Geauga Lake &amp; Wildwater Kingdom. The Wildwater Kingdom side had about six waterslides and a children&apos;s water play area. The Hurricane Hannah area remained. [ Geauga Lake Park Maps 2012 http://www.geaugalaketoday.com/Park_Maps.htm January 20, 2012 GeaugaLakeToday.com ] In 2006, Wildwater Kingdom was expanded to include Tidal Wave Bay. The Hurricane Hannah area was then shut down, leaving Wildwater Kingdom as the remaining water park. The season was also scaled back, eliminating the spring and fall weekend operations and opening strictly between Memorial Day and Labor Day with one last weekend in mid-September. At the end of the season, the X-Flight roller coaster was removed, as well as Steel Venom (formerly Superman The Ultimate Escape). The X-Flight was relocated to Kings Island and opened as Firehawk in 2007. And Steel Venom relocated to Dorney Park, where it opened for the 2008 season as Voodoo, until 2009 when it was renamed Possessed. One of the last standing rides, Ripcord, pictured in 2011 In 2007, the summer-only operation of Geauga lake continued. Rumors ranging from the total closing of Geauga Lake to closing everything except the water park to scaling back the rides area even more were rampant. Cedar Fair refused to comment on the rumors. The 2007 Oktoberfest on September 14, 15 and 16, 2007 was the final weekend for the amusement park. On Friday, September 21, 2007 Cedar Fair announced its decision to not reopen the ride side of Geauga Lake park and that Wildwater Kingdom side would reopen exclusively as a water park called Geauga Lake&apos;s Wildwater Kingdom. [ Geauga Lake silences rides; water park stays http://www.auroraadvocate.com/news/article/2603032 Hovey, Brent September 26, 2007 January 20, 2012 Aurora Advocate ] This led to efforts to save Geauga Lake, especially landmarks such as the Big Dipper and the Carousel, including an online petition and letters to public officials. Cedar Fair has placed the land of amusement park side of the park up for sale. The remaining rides and remnants were auctioned separately on June 17, 2008. Many returned to the park for one last visit on the June 16 auction preview day and the June 17 auction.
