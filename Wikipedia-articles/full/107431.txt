The population was 42,108 at the 2010 census, up from 18,016 at the 2000 census. This population growth is attributed through the combination of actual population increase within the 2000 CDP boundaries and expansion of the boundaries. The area of EDH was expanded from [ 17.9 sqmi km2 ] in 2000 to [ 48.606 sqmi km2 ] in 2010. El Dorado Hills residents and businesses are most closely affiliated with El Dorado County, a generally rural area. However, El Dorado County is part of the Sacramento Metropolitan Area because it is socially and economically integrated with the much larger Sacramento County and especially the City of Folsom. { United States Census Bureau, &quot; Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas &quot;. http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metroarea.html } El Dorado Hills is recognized nationally for its high median household income, ranking 77th in CNN Money Magazine&apos;s best places to live in 2007. { CNN Money Magazine Online, &quot; Best Places to Live in 2007 &quot;, http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2007/snapshots/PL0621880.html } [ History ] El Dorado Hills was settled as part of the Sierra Nevada Goldfields. It included the small historic town of Clarksville (circa 1855 to 1934). The town of Mormon Island, first settled in 1848 and now submerged under Folsom Lake, bordered the northwest area of El Dorado Hills. The center of modern El Dorado Hills lies about 13 miles from the 1848 gold discovery site in Coloma, where the California Gold Rush began. The South Fork of the American River washed gold downstream, into areas now in El Dorado Hills and Folsom, but farming and ranching superseded the Gold Rush. Portions of two Pony Express routes in this area from 1860-1861 remain as modern El Dorado Hills roads. El Dorado Hills includes the longest surviving section of the Lincoln Highway, the first U.S. transcontinental highway. This section, part of the Pioneer Branch, passes through historic Clarksville and is the predecessor of the modern US 50 route. The modern history of El Dorado Hills dates back to the early 1960s when original developer Alan Lindsey began its development as a master planned community. The original master plan, prepared by architect Victor Gruen, covered the area generally north of U.S. Highway 50, and part of the area south of US 50 now considered to be part of the community. El Dorado Hills was envisioned as a large-scale master-planned community that would be completely planned from its inception as a group of residential &quot; villages &quot;. Other land uses in the master plan included a business park, two 18-hole golf courses, community parks, schools, a community shopping center, and small commercial centers in each village. The master plan emphasized open space between villages and opportunity for outdoor recreation. Between the late &apos;60s and mid-1990s growth occurred at a moderate pace as new families relocated from Sacramento, Southern California and the Bay Area. This growth consisted primarily of residential housing, as retail developments were limited to two shopping centers on the corners Green Valley &amp; Francisco and El Dorado Hills Blvd. &amp; Hwy. 50. Each neighborhood created during this time period was given a name and referred to as a &quot; village &quot; by local inhabitants. The original villages of El Dorado Hills include Park, Ridgeview, Saint Andrews, Crown, Governors, Stonegate, Franciscan, Marina, and Lake Hills Estates. In the 1980s and 1990s the major part of Lake Hills Estates north of Green Valley Road, was reorganized into Lake Forest Village, containing the neighborhoods of Waterford, The Summit, Green Valley Hills, Winterhaven, Marina Woods and Windsor Point. Additional villages that have developed subsequently include Fairchild, Sterlingshire, Highland Hills, Highland View, Bridlewood, Hills of El Dorado, Woodridge, Laural Oaks and the master-planned community of Serrano. By the 1990 census, El Dorado Hills had an estimated population of 6,395 residents. { United States Census 1990, US Gazetteer, http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/gazetteer?city=El+Dorado+Hills &amp; state=CA &amp; zip= } Growth slowed during the early part of the &apos;90s due to an economic recession throughout California, but resumed at a staggering pace by the mid 1990s. Businesses, particularly those interested in escaping the high costs of Silicon Valley began to set up operations in the El Dorado Hills Business Park south of Highway 50. { Sacramento Business Journal, &quot; More Companies Leave Silicon Valley for EDH &quot; September 7, 2001. } In 1995, the Parker Development Company acquired [ 3500 acre km2 ] along the eastern boundary of El Dorado Hills to create Serrano, one of the largest master planned communities in Northern California. Serrano was the site of an innovative case of recycled water irrigation on a large scale. http://www.owue.water.ca.gov/recycle/WCN/Green-Grass_WCN1002.pdf Around the year 2000, its population growth and commercial development accelerated. Development began in its Town Center area to form a true downtown business area, and its Business Park experienced increasing rates of construction and occupancy. [ Geography and environment ] El Dorado Hills (EDH), as defined by the 2010 Census Designated Place, is at the western border of El Dorado County, between the City of Folsom and the unincorporated community of Cameron Park. The northern limits of the CDP are Folsom and the South Fork of the American River, where river rafters use Skunk Hollow and Salmon Falls as takeout landings. West of Latrobe Road, the south edge of the CDP follows railroad tracks formerly used by the Southern Pacific between the cities of Folsom and Placerville. East of Latrobe Road the south edge follows topography running roughly east/west. The 2010 CDP has a land area of [ 48.606 sqmi km2 ], more than double the size of its boundaries in 2000 CDP, which was [ 17.9 sqmi km2 ]. US 50 is the major east-west highway running through El Dorado Hills. The portion of EDH north of US 50 is mainly residential. The portion south of US 50 includes the 885-acre El Dorado Hills Business Park and the Town Center Commercial area, as well as additional housing. The subsurface environment of El Dorado Hills is relatively free of groundwater and soil contamination, based upon an areawide analysis of the potential for pesticide contamination and evaluation of underground storage tanks.(Earth Metrics, 1989) [ Demographics ] [ 2010 ] The 2010 United States Census reported that El Dorado Hills had a population of 42,108.
