[ Washington County History Winslow Tunnel Shiloh Museum of Ozark History 1989 Springdale, Arkansas 238 ] The town was renamed to Winslow on August 3, 1881 in honor of Edward F. Winslow, president of the Frsico. The town became a somewhat resort town for its picturesque peaks at the end of the 20th century, drawing many wealthy from the Fort Smith area to summer there.

[ Education ] This 1930 building formerly housed Winslow High School. It now contains the Winslow Public Library. [ March 2008 ] For many years, Winslow had its own school system. It served the city and nearby rural areas in the southern portion of Washington County. By most counts, enrollment for grades K-12 was usually in the mid-20s per grade. The district became part of the Greenland school district in 2004 after the Arkansas Legislature passed a state law that mandated districts with less than 350 students consolidate (Winslow had 273 students). The high school, which actually served grades 7-12, closed at the end of the 2004-2005 school year. The graduating class at the 2005 spring ceremony had 14 seniors. Winslow Elementary for grades K-6 was retained for a time following the high school closure. However, in November 2006, the Greenland School Board voted to close that school at the end of the 2006-2007 school year after two years with an enrollment of about 90 students. The athletic teams of Winslow were nicknamed the squirrels. The majority of the student body did not stay and go to Greenland. They instead opted to transfer to the West Fork school district. The voters of Winslow are currently petitioning the Arkansas Department of Education and Arkansas Legislature to change Winslow&apos;s former district from Greenland to West Fork. The Winslow campus now houses the Winslow Public Library, Friends of the Library Bookstore, and Internet Cafe in the old High school building. The Elementary School and other buildings have been boarded up and the doors, except the main doors, have been welded shut. [ Trivia ] There have been two movies that have used the city of Winslow as a filming location; Frank and Jesse and Smoke in the Wind.
