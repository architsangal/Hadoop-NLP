[ January 2011 ] [ January 2011 ] An engineering society is a professional organization for engineer s of various disciplines. Some are umbrella type organizations which accept many different disciplines, while others are discipline-specific. Many award professional designations, such as European Engineer, Professional Engineer, Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer or similar. There are also many student-run engineering societies, commonly at universities or technical colleges. [ Africa ] [ South Africa ] South African Institute of Electrical Engineers (SAIEE) [ Americas ] [ Canada ] In Canada, the term &apos;Engineering Society&apos; sometimes refers to organizations of engineering students as opposed to professional societies of engineers. The Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES), whose membership consists of most of the engineering student societies from across Canada (see below), is the national association of undergraduate engineering student societies in Canada. Canada also has many traditions related to the calling of an engineer. See Engineering traditions in Canada for more information. The Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC) ( French : l&apos;Institut Canadien des ingénieurs (ICI)) has the following member societies: [ 2011 2 4 ] IEEE Canada Institution of Mechanical Engineers (Canadian Branch of the IMechE) Canadian Dam Association Canadian Geotechnical Society Canadian Maritime Section of the Marine Technology Society Canadian Medical and Biological Engineering Society Canadian Nuclear Society Canadian Society for Bioengineering Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Canadian Society for Senior Engineers Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering Canadian Society for Engineering Management [ Atlantic Canada ] The Atlantic Council of Engineering Students (ACES) is the regional association of undergraduate engineering student societies in Atlantic Canada.

The engineers educated in universities ( [ diplomi-insinööri ] ) are represented by Finnish association of graduate engineers, while the engineers from polytechnics ( [ insinööri (AMK) ] ) are represented by Union of Professional Engineers in Finland. These organizations act both as trade union s and as professional bodies of the engineering profession. In addition, there is a large number of engineering societies for specific branches of technology. In addition, there are two national academies of engineering, the Finnish Academy of Technology ( [ Teknillisten tieteiden akatemia ], [ Akademin för Tekniska Vetenskaper ] ) for the Finnish-speaking community and Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences in Finland ( [ Svenska tekniska vetenskapsakademien i Finland ] ) for the Swedish-speaking community. [ Germany ] Verein Deutscher Ingenieure [ Greece ] Technical Chamber of Greece [ Ireland ] Institution of Engineers of Ireland Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine [ Portugal ] Ordem dos Engenheiros [ Romania ] In Romania the engineering community is led by the General Association of the Engineers in Romania (rom. Asociaţia Generală a Inginerilor din România), a professional community of engineers. They are specialized on various fields of activities like welding, non-traditional technologies and equipments, heat treating, stress and tensometry, economic etc. Other engineering communities are: Romanian Welding Society (rom. A.S.R.) Romanian Association of Heat-Treatment (rom. A.R.T.T.) Romanian Association of Non-Traditional Technologies (rom. A.R.T.N.) Romanian Association of Tensometry (rom. ARTENS) All these professional engineering communities and associations make efforts to integrate in a larger engineering community of the European Union.

EC(UK) is established by Royal Charter and controls the award of Chartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer titles within the UK. The Royal Academy of Engineering is the national academy for engineering, similar to the Royal Society in science and the British Academy in arts and humanities.
