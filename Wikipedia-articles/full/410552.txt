The Yankees won the series four games to three to advance to the World Series. [ Summary ] This series delivered yet another blow to Red Sox fans&apos; hopes of winning a World Series for the first time since 1918. The series seemed evenly matched, with the lead being held first by the Red Sox, then by the Yankees. The Sox forced the series to a full seven games, with the seventh game setting another major league record for the rivalry between the two teams : it marked the first time two major league teams have played more than 25 games against each other over the course of a single season.

Early on, Karim Garcia was hit in the back by a Martinez fastball. Words were exchanged and Martinez threateningly gestured towards Yankee catcher Jorge Posada. When Garcia was forced out at second, he slid hard into Todd Walker. The following inning, Manny Ramírez took exception to a high Clemens pitch and charged the mound. Both benches cleared, but the resulting brawl turned surreal when 72-year-old Yankee bench coach Don Zimmer charged Pedro Martínez. Martinez defended himself by throwing the man forty years his elder to the ground. After the thirteen-minute delay, Clemens struck out Ramirez and proceeded to pitch effectively as the Yankees held a lead. The game would not end quietly: a Fenway groundskeeper got into a scuffle with Yankee reliever Jeff Nelson while tending to the bullpen area.

The Red Sox scored the eventual deciding run when Jason Varitek just beat a potential double-play ground ball with the bases loaded.

Only three brilliant shutout innings by Mike Mussina (making the first relief appearance of his career) and two solo home runs by Jason Giambi kept the Yankees in the ballgame. But in the eighth inning, with the Red Sox leading 5–2, things unraveled for Boston. Sox manager Grady Little left a tiring Martinez in for the eighth, a controversial move which is still discussed years later. [ Shaughnessy Dan Reversing the Curse 2005 Houghton Mifflin Company Boston 0-618-51748-0 Dan Shaughnessy ] Little had two relievers who had shown some effectiveness in the games leading up to the seventh game— Scott Williamson and Mike Timlin (who had not allowed a single hit in the playoffs)—in the bullpen. However, both Williamson and Timlin had experienced stretches of ineffectiveness during the season, while Martinez had Hall of Fame credentials. [ Heartbreak again; Yankees beat Red Sox, 6-5, on 11th-inning homer to capture AL pennant October 17, 2003 Dan Shaughnessy Boston Globe A1 http://articles.boston.com/2003-10-17/news/29195353_1_red-sox-tim-wakefield-sox-fans ] Critics of the move note that Martinez had experienced diminished effectiveness in the late innings of games in which he had thrown more than 100 pitches. After the Cy Young Award winner Martinez assured his manager he still had something left, he gave up a double to Derek Jeter and a single to Bernie Williams, prompting Little to go out to the mound. To the surprise of many, Little left Martinez in the game, leaving lefty Alan Embree in the bullpen with the left-handed Hideki Matsui coming to the plate. Martinez gave up a double to Matsui and a bloop double to Jorge Posada to tie the game, sending it to extra innings. Mariano Rivera came in for the ninth and pitched three shutout innings. Tim Wakefield pitched a scoreless tenth for Boston and in the bottom of the eleventh faced Aaron Boone, who had entered earlier as a pinch-runner. In one of the most dramatic scenes in baseball history, on the first pitch Boone launched a home run into the left field seats. Fox Sports displayed a vivid collection of images thereafter: tears welling up in the eyes of Aaron&apos;s brother, Seattle Mariners infielder Bret Boone (the guest announcer), ALCS MVP Mariano Rivera running to the mound and collapsing on it in joy, Boone jumping on home plate, and Rivera being carried off on his teammates&apos; shoulders.

In his book Now I Can Die in Peace, Bill Simmons writes that the Boston owners and Theo Epstein had ordered Little to remove Pedro from the game when he finished the seventh inning and/or topped the three-digit pitch count. Martinez was sure he would not be called on for the eighth inning, but agreed to do so when his manager asked him. After the game, Little reportedly and prophetically told his pitcher &quot; Petey, I might not be here anymore. &quot; Little defended his move by saying that he felt a tired Martinez was a better option than anyone else on the team. Defenders of Little also noted that the Red Sox offense collapsed in the game, as the club scored only two runs in the last nine innings of the contest and also noted the poor defensive play of Johnny Damon in center field during the crucial inning. Others have noted that by staying with a physically fragile pitcher in an ultimate game with two runners on base, a two run lead, a rested pitcher who had performed well in the post season ready in the bullpen and the other team&apos;s MVP on deck, Little did exactly what Hall of Fame manager Walter Alston did with Sandy Koufax in Game 7 of the 1965 World Series, which Alston&apos;s Dodgers won. Little&apos;s contract was not renewed after the season and he was replaced by Terry Francona.

The Cubs reached the 2003 National League Championship Series against the Florida Marlins. As with the Red Sox, they had a three-run lead and were only five outs away from reaching the World Series, although this was in Game 6, when the Marlins scored eight runs in that inning and won the game 8–3.
