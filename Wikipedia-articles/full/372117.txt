It is a part of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) network. The line&apos;s name is an abbreviation of the two areas the line connects: [ 埼玉 Saitama ] and [ 東京 Tōkyō ]. At the northern end of the line, some trains continue beyond Ōmiya as far as [ Kawagoe ] on the Kawagoe Line; at the southern end of the line, many Saikyō Line trains continue onward beyond Ōsaki to [ Shin-Kiba ] on the Rinkai Line (operated by Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit ). Beside the link that connects the Saikyō and Rinkai lines is the JR East Tokyo General Rolling Stock Centre that stores the rolling stock for the Yamanote Line and other types of rolling stock.

The portion between Ikebukuro and Akabane is officially known as the [ Akabane Line 赤羽線 ]. For most purposes, JR refers to all of these as part of the &quot; Saikyō Line &quot; when being used for Saikyō Line services. { JR Timetable, December 2008 issue } [ Service ] There are three types of trains on the Saikyō Line: local ( [ ja 普通 ] ), rapid ( [ ja 快速 ] ) and commuter rapid ( [ ja 通勤快速 ] ). Between Akabane and Ōmiya, rapid trains stop only at Toda-Kōen, Musashi-Urawa and Yonohommachi, while Commuter Rapid trains, which run during rush hours, stop only at Musashi-Urawa. South of Akabane, as well as on the Kawagoe and Rinkai lines, all trains stop at all stations. [ Station list ] Local trains stop at all stations.

One of the earliest, the [ Tokyo-Ōmiya Electric Railway 東京大宮電気鉄道 Tōkyō-Ōmiya Denki Tetsudō ], was founded in 1928 but went bankrupt shortly thereafter due to rising land values in the area. Later, in 1968, the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Transportation proposed to run the new Toei Mita Line to central Ōmiya. Development of the Saikyō Line began as a Japanese National Railways effort to quell unrest in Saitama regarding the expansion of the Tōhoku and Jōetsu shinkansen. During the mid-1970s, local protesters staged sit-ins, demonstrations, and administrative actions to impede the building of the new high-speed lines north of Tokyo. JNR reached a settlement with the activists under which it would build a commuter line to serve these local communities, while being allowed to continue extending the Shinkansen. The new line, tentatively called the [ &quot; New Commuter Line &quot; 通勤新線 Tsūkin Shinsen ], was built between Ōmiya and Akabane. Through service to Ikebukuro via the existing Akabane Line began on September 30, 1985. The line was initially troubled by inadequate train control systems which could not keep pace with its frequency of service; however, these issues were worked out during the first month of service. When the Tōhoku Main Line portion of the Saikyō Line was being built, the stations from Kita-Akabane to Kita-Yono were designated with numbers from 1 to 10; Kita-Akabane Station was known as &quot; New Commuter Line Station No. 1. &quot; However, even after names were assigned, passengers complained that each station looked just like the next due to their identical construction. As a result, JNR, in an unusual move, assigned colors to those stations so that they could be told apart from one another. Saikyo Line and Tohoku Shinkansen In March 1986, the Saikyō Line began through service to Shinjuku via the Yamanote Freight Line, which had seen less use by freight services since the opening of the Musashino Line in 1973. Service to Shibuya and Ebisu did not begin until 1996, when new platforms were completed to accommodate passenger service. Service to Ōsaki and the Rinkai Line began in 2001. The Saikyō Line has had a particularly severe problem of overcrowding during peak periods, especially during weekday mornings. The opening of the Shōnan-Shinjuku Line in 2004 and the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line in 2008, both of which parallel the Saikyō Line for part of its route, alleviated some of the worst crowding. Problems resulting from overcrowding have included a higher incidence of groping, as well as delays in train schedule caused by longer time taken at each station to pick up and drop off passengers. The Saikyō Line was notorious for having the highest reported number of groping-related incidents (known as chikan incidents) in the Greater Tokyo area. { &quot; Worst for Chikan in Tokyo is Saikyo Line &quot; Yomiuri Shimbun, February 8, 2005, retrieved June 19, 2006 } This problem was directly addressed by introducing women-only passenger car s during rush hours, and indirectly addressed by reducing overcrowding problems as a whole.
