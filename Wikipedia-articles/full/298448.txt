Meteorites are often studied as part of cosmochemistry. Cosmochemistry or chemical cosmology is the study of the chemical composition of matter in the universe and the processes that led to those compositions. [ McSween Harry Cosmochemistry 2010 Cambridge University Press 0-521-87862-4 Russ, Gary 1 ] This is done primarily through the study of the chemical composition of meteorite s and other physical samples. Given that the asteroid parent bodies of meteorites were some of the first solid material to condense from the early solar nebula, cosmochemists are generally, but not exclusively, concerned with the objects contained within the solar system. [ History ] In 1938, Swiss mineralogist Victor Goldschmidt and his colleagues compiled a list of what they called &quot; cosmic abundances &quot; based on their analysis of several terrestrial and meteorite samples. [ Goldschmidt Victor Geochemische Verteilungsgestze der Elemente IX 1938 Skrifter Utgitt av Det Norske Vidensk. Akad. Oslo ] Goldschmidt justified the inclusion of meteorite composition data into his table by claiming that terrestrial rocks were subjected to a significant amount of chemical change due to the inherent processes of the Earth and the atmosphere. This meant that studying terrestrial rocks exclusively would not yield an accurate overall picture of the chemical composition of the cosmos. Therefore, Goldschmidt concluded that extraterrestrial material must also be included to produce more accurate and robust data. This research is considered to be the foundation of modern cosmochemistry. During the 1950s and 1960s, cosmochemistry became more accepted as a science. Harold Urey, widely considered to be one of the fathers of cosmochemistry, engaged in research that eventually led to an understanding of the origin of the elements and the chemical abundance of stars. In 1956, Urey and his colleague, German scientist Hans Suess, published the first table of cosmic abundances to include isotopes based on meteorite analysis. [ Suess Hans Urey, Harold Abundances of the Elements Reviews of Modern Physics 1956 28 1 53–74 1956RvMP...28...53S 10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53 ] The continued refinement of analytical instrumentation throughout the 1960s, especially that of mass spectrometry, allowed cosmochemists to perform detailed analyses of the isotopic abundances of elements within meteorites. in 1960, John Reynolds determined, through the analysis of short-lived nuclides within meteorites, that the elements of the solar system were formed before the solar system itself [ Reynolds John Isotopic Composition of Primordial Xenon Physical Review Letters 1960 April 4 7 351–354 10.1103/PhysRevLett.4.351 http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.4.351 1960PhRvL...4..351R ] which began to establish a timeline of the processes of the early solar system. In October 2011, scientists reported that cosmic dust contains complex organic matter ( &quot; amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic - aliphatic structure &quot; ) that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars.

Many meteorites come from material that is as old as the solar system itself, and thus provides scientists with a record from the early solar nebula. Carbonaceous chondrite s are especially primitive; that is they have retained many of their chemical properties since their formation 4.56 billion years ago, [ McSween Harry Are Carbonaceous Chondrites Primitive or Processed? A Review Reviews of Geophysics and Space Physics 1979 August 17 5 1059–1078 10.1029/RG017i005p01059 10 August 2011 1979RvGSP..17.1059M ] and are therefore a major focus of cosmochemical investigations. Recent findings by NASA, based on studies of meteorites found on Earth, suggests DNA and RNA components ( adenine, guanine and related organic molecules ), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in outer space.
