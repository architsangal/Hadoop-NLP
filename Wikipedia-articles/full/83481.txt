[ Chad ] { punched card s. Each chad is about 1/8 inch (3 mm) long. } { UNIVAC } { key punch } { Computer History Museum } Chad refers to paper fragments created when hole s are made in a paper, card or similar synthetic materials, typically computer punched tape or punched card s. &quot; Chad &quot; has been used both as a mass noun and as a countable noun, so the plural is either &quot; chad &quot; (as in &quot; a pile of chad &quot; ) or &quot; chads &quot; (as in &quot; the multiple hanging chads &quot; ). Chad was made infamous in the highly contentious 2000 United States presidential election where many of Florida votes used Votomatic style punched card ballots. Incompletely-punched holes resulted in partially punched chad, where one or more corners were still attached, a hanging chad, dimpled chad or pregnant chad - where all corners were still attached, but an indentation appears to have been made. These votes were not counted by the tabulating machines.

When a hole punch of the functional or decorative type is used, it removes a small amount of paper - a chad. Chad are also common in stores, where holes are punched so that merchandise can be hung on pegs or clips. Chad are also the small strips, pieces of paper or shred waste that remain of the documents fed through a paper shredder. Chad can also be the result of punching holes in any sort of thin material, such as cloth, plastic, or even sheet metal. Chad is sometimes used as confetti. This is generally harmless when using thin circular paper chad. The rectangular chad from punched cards is unsuitable due to the sharp corners and the toughness of the card stock risking eye injury. { ticket punch } [ Etymology ] The origin of the term chad is uncertain. Patent documents from the 1930s and 1940s show the word chad, often in reference to punched tape used in telegraphy. These patents sometimes include synonyms such as chaff and chips. A patent filing in 1930 included a &quot; receptacle or chad box... to receive the chips cut from the edge of the tape. &quot; { Howard L. Krum, Coupon Printer, U.S. Patent 1,884,755, filed Oct. 16, 1930, issued Oct. 25, 1932. } A 1938 patent filing included a &quot; chaff or chad chute &quot; to collect the chad. { Albert H. Reiber, Telegraph Transmitter, U.S. Patent 2,213,475, filed July 18, 1938, issued Sept. 3, 1940. } Both patents were assigned to Teletype Corporation. The plural chads is attested from about 1939, along with chadless, meaning without [loose] chad. Clear definitions for both terms are offered by Walter Bacon in a patent application filed in 1940 assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories : &quot;... In making these perforations, the perforator cuts small round pieces of paper, known in the art as chads, out of the tape. These chads are objectionable... Chadless tape is prepared by feeding blank tape through a device which will not punch a complete circle in the tape but, instead, will only cut approximately three-quarters of the circumference of a circle... thereby leaving a movable, or hinged, lid of paper in the tape. { Walter M. Bacon, Tape Splicer, U.S. Patent 2,246,655, filed Feb. 20, 1940, issued June 24, 1941. } In the New Hacker&apos;s Dictionary, two derivations for chad are offered, a back-formation from chadless and an acronym for Card Hole Aggregate Debris. { Eric S. Raymond, Chad, The New Hacker&apos;s Dictionary, Third Ed., 1996; page 108. } These are clearly intended as jokes. More serious speculation about the origins of the word Chad suggests derivation from the Scottish name for river gravel, chad, or the British slang for louse, chat. [ July 2011 ] Chad may also be derived from the Indo European &apos;chadd&apos; to discard or throw away see A K Warder Introduction to Pali, Pali text society 2010. [ Partially punched chad ] Votomatic voting machines of the type used in the 2000 election in Florida When a chad is not fully detached from the ballot it is described by various terms corresponding to the level of indentation. The following terms generally apply when describing a four-cornered chad: [ https://www2.norc.org/fl/method3.asp Methodology : Coding Process Florida Ballots Project 2009-05-23 ] Hanging chad are attached to the ballot at only one corner. Swinging chad are attached to the ballot at two corners. Tri-chad are attached to the ballot at three corners. Pregnant or dimpled chad are attached to the ballot at all four corners, but bear an indentation indicating the voter may have intended to mark the ballot. (Sometimes pregnant is used to indicate a greater mark than dimpled.) [ Chad in popular culture ] The 2006 film Bobby makes light of the term chad by making it a backronym of Card Hole Aggregate Debris. In the TV show How I Met Your Mother, 2011 episode &quot; The Slutty Pumpin Returns &quot; shows character Ted Mosby in 2001 dressed as a &apos;hanging chad.&apos; Later in the episode he wears the same costume to a party. In the TV show The Simpsons, in the 2002 episode entitled &quot; The Lastest Gun in the West &quot;, the following exchange occurs: Krusty: I want my show to have a timeless quality. Man: Here&apos;s your hanging chad sketch, Krusty! Krusty: Ooh, you worked in Judge Ito ! In the TV show Entourage, Jeremy Piven&apos;s character, Ari Gold, mentions a hanging chad when the box office numbers get affected due to the blackouts.
