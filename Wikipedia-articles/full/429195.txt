She was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bullhead (any large-headed fish, especially the catfish, miller&apos;s thumb, and sculpin ). Her keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 16 July 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Howard R. Doyle, and commissioned 4 December 1944 with Commander W. T. Griffith in command. [ Operations ] Insignia of &apos;&apos;Bullhead&apos;&apos; Bullhead served in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. The war operations of Bullhead extended from 21 March to August 1945 during which time she completed two war patrols. Her area of operations included the Java Sea and South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam. [ First patrol ] During the greater portion of her first war patrol Bullhead performed lifeguard services and on two occasions bombarded Pratas Island, China, damaging enemy radio installations. She also rescued three airmen from a downed B-29 Superfortress following an air strike on the China coast. [ Second patrol ] On her second patrol, in May and June 1945 in the Gulf of Siam and the South China Sea, Bullhead sank two small freighters, a schooner and a sub chaser totaling 1800  tons and damaged two more sub chasers and another small freighter, all in gun actions. { Bullhead&apos;s 1945 records claims are 1 ship sunk May 30; 1 ship sunk June 18 and 1 ship sunk and 3 damaged June 19 and 1 ship sunk June 25; for confirmation of 2 ships sunk by Bullhead June 18 &amp; June 19 see } [ Third patrol and sinking ] On 31 July 1945 Bullhead left Fremantle to commence her third war patrol. Her orders were to patrol in a &quot; wolfpack &quot; with [ Capitaine SS-336 3 ] and [ Puffer SS-268 3 ] in the Java Sea until 5 September and then head for Subic Bay in the Philippines. Bullhead reported on 6 August that she had passed through Lombok Strait. That was the last word received from Bullhead. On 12 August, Capitaine, planning to arrive on 13 August, ordered Bullhead to take position the following day in a scouting line with Capitaine and Puffer. Receiving no reply, Capitaine reported on 15 August, &quot; Have been unable to contact Bullhead by any means since arriving in area. &quot; Since the British submarines [ Taciturn ] and &apos;&apos;Thorough&apos;&apos;, were in the same general area as Bullhead, and [ Cod SS-224 3 ] and [ Chub SS-329 3 ] passed through in transit at various times, it is difficult to determine precisely which of the many Japanese anti-submarine attacks was the one that sank Bullhead. However, one occurred on 6 August 1945, when a Imperial Japanese Army Air Force 73Fcs&apos;s Mitsubishi Ki-51 attacked with depth charge s. It claimed two direct hits, and for ten minutes thereafter, there was a great amount of gushing oil and air bubbles rising in the water. Since the position given is very near the Bali coast, it is presumed that the proximity of mountain peaks shortened Bullhead&apos;s radar range and prevented her receiving a warning of the plane&apos;s approach. [ Commendations ] Bullhead received two battle star s for her World War II service.
