[ Biography ] Tardieu was a graduate of the elite Lycée Condorcet. He was accepted by the even more prestigious École Normale Supérieure, but instead entered the diplomatic service. Later, he left the service and became famous as foreign affairs editor of the newspaper Le Temps. He founded the conservative newspaper L&apos;Echo National in association with Georges Mandel. In 1914 Tardieu was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from the département of Seine-et-Oise, as a candidate of the center-right Democratic Republican Alliance (Alliance Démocratique - AD). He retained this seat till 1924. From 1926 to 1936, he represented the département of Territoire de Belfort. When World War I broke out, Tardieu enlisted in the army, serving as an infantryman till 1916. He then returned to politics. He served as Georges Clemenceau &apos;s lieutenant in 1919 during the Paris Peace Conference and as Commissioner for Franco-American War Cooperation. On 8 November 1919, he became Minister of Liberated Regions, administering Alsace and Lorraine, serving until Clemenceau&apos;s defeat in 1920. In 1926, Tardieu returned to government as Minister of Transportation under Raymond Poincaré. In 1928, he moved to Minister of the Interior, continuing under Poincaré&apos;s successor Aristide Briand. In November 1929 Tardieu himself succeeded Briand as Président du Conseil (Prime Minister), while remaining Interior Minister. Though generally considered a conservative, when Tardieu became Prime Minister, he introduced a program of welfare measures, including public works, social insurance, and free secondary schooling, and he encouraged modern techniques in industry. Tardieu was displaced from both offices for ten days in February–March 1930 by Radical Camille Chautemps, but returned till that December. He was subsequently Minister of Agriculture in 1931, Minister of War in 1932, and again Prime Minister (also, this time, Minister of Foreign Affairs ), from 30 February to 3 June 1932, until the AD and its coalition partners were defeated in the May elections. Due this premiership Tardieu served for three (7–10 May 1932) days as the Acting President of the French Republic. between assassination of Paul Doumer and election of Albert Lebrun. He was briefly a Minister of State without portfolio in 1934. His later political activity was largely concerned with containing and responding to German expansion. In his two-volume book La Révolution à refaire, Tardieu criticized the French parliamentary system.
