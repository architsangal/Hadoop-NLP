As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough population was 7,822. Caldwell was incorporated as a borough by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 10, 1892, from portions of Caldwell Township (now Fairfield Township), based on the results of a referendum held on the previous day. { &quot; The Story of New Jersey&apos;s Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968 &quot;, John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 75. } In 1981, the name was changed to the &quot; Township of the Borough of Caldwell &quot; to take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies. { New Jersey State Commission on County and Municipal Government, Modern Forms of Municipal Government, 1992, Chapter VI: Municipal Names and Municipal Classification } Effective January 26, 1995, it again became a borough. { 1990s boundary changes: New Jersey, } { United States Census Bureau. Accessed August 30, 2011. } Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, and the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms, was born in Caldwell on March 18, 1837. His father, Rev. Richard Cleveland, was pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. The Grover Cleveland birthplace — the church&apos;s former rectory — is now a museum and is open to the public. { Grover Cleveland Birthplace, } { New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry } { New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

When it was formed, a few miles of woods separated downtown Caldwell from Newark or any of its developing suburbs. New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Caldwell as its 3rd best place to live in its 2010 rankings of the &quot; Best Places To Live &quot; in New Jersey. { &quot; Best Places To Live - The Complete Top Towns List 1-100 &quot;, } { New Jersey Monthly, February 11, 2010.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of [ 1.19 sqmi ], all of it land. Caldwell is part of &quot; The Caldwells &quot;, the group of three Essex County municipalities which all have the word Caldwell in their name. Together with North Caldwell and West Caldwell, these communities are named after the Reverend James Caldwell, a Patriot who played an active role supporting the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, most notably his actions at the Battle of Springfield, where he gave the soldiers pages from hymn books to use as wadding for their rifle bullets. { NJ Community Prepares to Honor Fighting Spirit of Reverend James Caldwell, accessed August 6, 2006. } While each community has its own independent government, and the three municipalities have no shared governance (other than Essex County), the term is often used to refer to the area, including on highway exit signs. Signage for Exit 47B and 52 on Interstate 80 refer to &quot; The Caldwells &quot; as a destination. Fairfield Township was known as Caldwell Township until it abandoned its original name in 1963 in an effort to avoid confusion of mail distribution in the various Caldwells. { Wright, George Cable. &quot; JERSEY AROUSED BY REFERENDUMS; Some Ballots on Tuesday to List Nine Questions Junior College Vote Name Change in Brick &quot;, } { The New York Times, November 3, 1963.

Accessed June 30, 2011. } [ Historical information ] In 1702, settlers purchased the [ 14,000 acre km2 ] Horseneck Tract from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans for goods equal to $325. This purchase encompassed much of western Essex County, from the First Mountain to the Passaic River. Caldwell is located in the center of the Horse Neck Tract. Settlement began about 1740 by Thomas Gould and Saunders Sanders. The Horseneck Tract consisted of modern day Caldwell, West Caldwell, North Caldwell, Fairfield, Verona, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, Roseland, and portions of Livingston and West Orange. This land was part of the larger purchase and referred to as the Horse Neck Tract until February 17, 1787, when the town congregation voted to change the name to Caldwell, in honor of the Reverend James Caldwell who pushed for their organization’s creation. Caldwell Township contained what is today the towns of West Caldwell and Caldwell. Soon after, the area of Caldwell Township just to the east of Caldwell Borough between Caldwell Borough and Montclair (present-day Verona and Cedar Grove) decided to follow Caldwell&apos;s lead and incorporated itself as its own borough, Verona. Some of the already-developed eastern neighborhoods of Caldwell Township chose to become part of Montclair, as it was a rapidly-developing suburb of Newark and Paterson. At around the same time, the area north of Caldwell Borough became its own town, North Caldwell. The wooded area directly to the south of downtown Caldwell Borough became Essex Fells. Meanwhile, the farmland to the south of the western portion of Caldwell township attempted to become its own municipality known as South Caldwell. This failed, as much of developed sections of that area lied on its southernmost and easternmost borders, along the expanding Newark suburbs of Livingston and West Orange respectively. Those areas were engulfed by those two towns once they became incorporated municipalities of several small villages and developments. This left only the most rural farmland south of Caldwell Borough and Essex Fells to become its own township, Roseland. At this point, all that remained of the original Caldwell Township was a large piece of undeveloped land in the northwestern-most part of Essex County; eventually, in the early 1950s, Caldwell Township changed its name to Fairfield in order to avoid being confused with Caldwell Borough. Immediately following the separation of the original Caldwell, the western part of Caldwell Borough generally remained less developed than downtown Caldwell Borough and contained several farms and a large area of undeveloped swampland known as Hatfield Swamp. However, two individual settlements, known as Franklin and Westville, soon formed in the western part of Caldwell Borough. As development increased and population grew in the western part of Caldwell, the town&apos;s more rural western population and more urban east often could not reconcile their differences. This led to the areas of Franklin and Westville consolidating into their own township known as West Caldwell in 1904, leaving only the one square mile of original downtown Horseneck development as the borough of Caldwell. Lewis G. Lockward was elected the first mayor of Caldwell. In 1929, a failed attempt to consolidate the three Caldwells was rejected by voters. This borough was one of the filming locations for the Columbia Pictures 1994 comedy film North. [ Trivia ] George Washington and his staff made their way through the town during the Revolution. They stopped at the old stone house of Saunders Sanders, one of the two people to settle the original area, for lunch. Marquis de Lafayette visited in 1824. The town held a celebration party at the Crane Tavern. During the 1928 Presidential campaign, Herbert Hoover visited the Grover Cleveland Birthplace with his wife. Grover Cleveland lived the first four years of his life in Caldwell. In October 1897, a severe fire ripped through a large portion of Bloomfield Avenue, destroying buildings in its wake. These buildings were replaced, in part, by the Hasler Building, opposite the Presbyterian Church. This became the town’s first brick building. In 1914, during a Fourth of July fireworks celebration, a bomb fell, injuring twenty people. The town&apos;s Churches raised funds to supplement the medical bills of the injured. In 1968, the town’s historic cannon was stolen off the town green. The cannon had been given to the town by Colonial Peter Decatur in 1824. On July 14, 1974, the landmark Park Theatre was destroyed in a fire.
