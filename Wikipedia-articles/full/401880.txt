Nicknamed the Manchester of Asia, Faisalabad remains an important industrial city west of Lahore. The city-district of Faisalabad is bound on the north by the districts of Hafizabad and Chiniot, on the east by Nankana Sahib, on the south by Sahiwal, and Toba Tek Singh and on the west by Jhang. The city is at a road and railway junction, which has played an influential role in the development of Faisalabad&apos;s trade and economy. The surrounding countryside, irrigated by the Lower Chenab River, has seen expanded production of cotton, wheat, sugarcane, vegetables, and fruits, which form 55% of Pakistan&apos;s exports. The city is an industrial centre with major railway repair yards, engineering works, and mills that process sugar, flour, and oil seed. Produce includes superphosphate s, cotton and silk textiles, hosiery, dyes, industrial chemicals, beverages, apparels, pulp and paper, printing, agricultural equipment, and ghee (clarified butter). Faisalabad is the site of the prestigious University of Agriculture, founded in 1909. [ History ] Tomb of Sir James Broadwood Lyall located in Jinnah Gardens. Faisalabad remained a semi-desert area where tribes traveled in gypsy manner. Because of impure ground water and its distance of [ 30 km ] from any river ( Chenab River in this case), it was never used as permanent residence by roaming tribes. [ December 2011 ] Faisalabad was originally known as Chenab Colony, then Sandalbar and then Lyallpur. It was once part of ancient district of Jhang and Sandalbar, a [ 5000 km2 ] area consisting mainly of thick forests and inhabited by wild tribes. The tract from Shahdara to Shorkot, Sangla Hill to Toba Tek Singh, was traditionally called Sandalbar. [ December 2011 ] In 1870s the colonial era Punjab government decided to increase the cultivated land by making barrages and canals to meet the demand at European markets. This led to the canal based irrigation of the areas now comprising the district of Faisalabad. In 1880, a colonial officer, Captain Poham Young, with the support of Sir James Broadwood Lyall, proposed a new town. The design was based on the Union Jack, with eight roads radiating from a large clock tower in the centre. The eight roads developed into eight separate bazaars. The construction of artificial canals allowed the surrounding areas to be irrigated. The town grew rapidly as people were invited with promises of land. A large number of settlers came from different areas of Punjab especially from Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Ambala on the promise of large agricultural lands. With the extensively planned distribution of land the canal irrigated areas of Sandal Bar soon became populated. This led to a rapid transformation of the nomadic environment of the Bar into a more agriculture based one. [ December 2011 ] In 1892 the government of India decided to join Faisalabad (then Lyallpur) with a rail link to major rail network to transport agricultural surplus to the ports to be shipped to European markets. In 1895 the rail link between Wazirabad and Lyallpur was completed. In 1896, Lyallpur was given the status of a tehsil of the Jhang District, and its administration was carried on in tents on the old Theh ( Mound ) of Pucca Mari near Tariqabad. The majestic Clock Tower was constructed out of the funds raised by the Sikh landowners, who collected it at a rate of Rs. 18 per square of land. The fund thus raised was handed over to the Town Committee, which undertook to complete the project. [ December 2011 ] { Pakistan Railways locomotive parked at Lyallpur Railway Station c. 1949 } By 1902 the population of the town exceeded 4,000, including the new sialkoti jutts, particularly Bajwas, Kalloos, Cheemas &amp; Chattas came to establish the agriculture land of Chenaab (called Chena bar). Houses and shops had been constructed to cater to the ordinary needs of the population. In 1903 it was decided to establish an agricultural college. In 1904 the new district of Lyallpur was constituted, composed of the tehsils of Lyallpur, Samundri and Toba Tek Singh, with a subtehsil at Jaranwala which later became a full tehsil. By 1906, the district headquarters began to function in Lyallpur and all the bazaars and settlements within the bounds of a ring road were nearing completion. The city began to spread outside the circular road. The Town Committee was upgraded to a Municipal Committee in 1909 and the Deputy Commissioner was appointed as its first chairman. In 1916, the grain market saw its shops surging with customers. In the same year the civil hospital was expanded. With the advent of World War II, there was an increase in political awareness across the city. Revolutionary meetings were held, fiery speeches made, and slogans written on walls. [ December 2011 ] The First Colonisation officer Raja Aurangzeb Khan made sure that no individual in this district owned more than 25 squares ( [ 625 acre km2 ] ) of land. The merit or method of allotting the land was to check each individual&apos;s hand who was applying for some land, and if the hands showed that individual had worked hard in the past, only then was land given to him, which has led to a district where there aren&apos;t any big land owners, as the land has been equally distributed amongst hard working men and it is their hard work that has led to Faisalabad becoming the third richest district in Pakistan. [ August 2010 ] The main roads in and out of the city were kept [ 1 acre m2 on ] wide; since creation of Pakistan a lot of roads have been taken over by land mafia. Some industrial areas were kept on the East of the main canal which is present-day People&apos;s Colony and Madina town. The urban areas were kept to the west of the canal, as sweet ground water flowed from the canal to the river Chenab, the consequence of changing former industrial area into urban areas has been a lack of proper drinkable water for those living in peoples colony and Madina town. Another industrial area was developed at the west end of town, now around the road towards the central Punjab town of Sargodha. These earlier development of industrial areas led to industrialization of the city of Faisalabad right from its inception. Initial industrial setup were related to cotton and basic textiles, still the most dominant industry of the city with more value added products. Besides textiles food processing, grain crushing and small chemical industry was established in the pre-second World War era. { Chenab Club, a social club built during the reign of the } { British Empire } In 1943, Mohammad Ali Jinnah came to Lyallpur and addressed a gathering of over 2 million in Dhobi Ghat Grounds. After independence, the city of Lyallpur enjoyed considerable development, and became a major commercial and industrial center. The population grew quickly past one million. There was an expansion of the provision of health and education in the city. In 1977, the name of the city was changed to &quot; Faisalabad &quot; (City of Faisal), in honour of the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who was held in high regard in Pakistan. In 1985, the district was upgraded to a division with the new districts of Faisalabad, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh.

In addition to these, there are Zaid Kharif and Zaid Rabi crops. Zaid Kharif crops are toria, raiya, sarsoon and Zaid Rabi crop is tobacco.

In April 1981 the survey was carried out again which recorded the population to 1,232,000 which made the growth rate approximately 4.6%. Given this growth rate, the population at the end of 1981 was estimated to be 1,240,000. The emergence of Faisalabad as a major agriculture and industrial center created a great increase in the city&apos;s population. From a population of 69,930 in 1941, it rose to 179,000 in 1951, an increase of 152.2% this was mainly due to the settlement of Muslim refugees from East Punjab and Haryana who came from India and settled in Faisalabad.

Faisalabad became a record in the demographic history for Pakistan by registering an overall population increase of 508.1% between 1941 and 1961.

Floods are caused by the overflow of the Ravi on account of heavy rains in its catchment areas during the monsoon. Floods are a recurrent feature since the rivers cannot hold the vast amount of water flowing from the northern areas to the south of the country. These floods cause extensive damage to crops and villages periodically. The provincial government is proposing dam s and barrages to control the flow of water in the future. However, local settlements are not keen on this idea. The wildlife of the district includes fox es, boar s, jackal s and wild cat s.
