Throughout her career she has worked in a wide variety of mediums, including painting, collage, sculpture, performance art and environmental installations, most of which exhibit her thematic interest in psychedelic colors, repetition and pattern. A precursor of the pop art, minimalist and feminist art movements, Kusama influenced contemporaries such as Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg. { Kate Deimling (May 16, 2012), Kusama Writes of Hunger, Grudges, and Necking With Joseph Cornell in Her Odd Autobiography, ARTINFO France. } Although largely forgotten after departing the New York art scene in the early 1970s, Kusama is now acknowledged as one of the most important living artists to come out of Japan, and an important voice of the avant-garde. Born in Matsumoto, Nagano into an upper middle class family of seedling merchants { Farah Nayeri (February 14, 2012), Man-Hating Artist Kusama Covers Tate Modern in Dots: Interview } { Bloomberg. }, Kusama started creating art at an early age, going on to study Nihonga painting in Kyoto in 1948. Frustrated with this distinctly Japanese style, she became interested in the European and American avant-garde, staging several solo exhibitions of her paintings in Matsumoto and Tokyo during the 1950s. In 1957 she moved to the United States, settling down in New York City where she produced a series of paintings influenced by the abstract expressionist movement. Switching to sculpture and installation as her primary mediums, Kusama became a fixture of the New York avant-garde, having her works exhibited alongside the likes of Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and George Segal during the early 1960s, where she became associated with the pop art movement. Embracing the rise of the hippie counterculture of the late 1960s, Kusama came to public attention after she organised a series of Body Festivals in which naked participants were painted with brightly colored polka dots. In 1973, Kusama moved back to her native Japan, where she found the art scene far more conservative than that in New York. Becoming an art dealer, her business folded after several years, and after experiencing psychiatric problems, in 1977 she voluntarily admitted herself to a hospital, where she has spent the rest of her life. From here, she continued to produce artworks in a variety of mediums, as well as launching a literary career by publishing several novels, a poetry collection and an autobiography. Kusama&apos;s work is based in conceptual art and shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. Kusama is also a published novelist and poet, and has created notable work in film and fashion design. Major retrospectives of her work have been held at the Museum of Modern Art and Tate Modern, whilst in 2008 Christies New York sold a work by her for $5.1 million, a record for a living female artist. { New York art sales } { The Guardian, retrieved November 2008 } [ Biography ] [ Early life: 1929 &amp; amp;ndash;1949 ] Born in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture as the fourth child in a prosperous and conservative family, { Yayoi Kusama Timeline Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. } whose wealth was derived from the management of wholesale seed nurseries, { Catalogue, Tate Modern exhibition, London, 2012 } Kusama has experienced hallucinations and severe obsessive thoughts since childhood, often of a suicidal nature. She claims that as a small child she suffered severe physical abuse by her mother. { 2007 interview at ArtReview.com } In 1948, she left home to enter senior class at Kyoto Municipal School of Arts and Crafts, where she studied Nihonga painting, a rigorous formal style developed during the Meiji period; she graduated the following year. { Yayoi Kusama Timeline Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. } She hated the rigidities of the master-disciple system where students were supposed to imbibe tradition through the sensei. “When I think of my life in Kyoto,” she is quoted, “I feel like vomiting.” { David Pilling (January 20, 2012), The world according to Yayoi Kusama } { Financial Times Weekend Magazine. } [ Early success in Japan: 1950 &amp; amp;ndash;1956 ] By 1950, Kusama was depicting abstracted natural forms in watercolor, gouache and oil, primarily on paper. She began covering surfaces (walls, floors, canvas es, and later, household objects and naked assistants) with the polka dot s that would become a trademark of her work. The vast fields of polka dots, or &quot; infinity nets, &quot; as she called them, were taken directly from her hallucinations. The earliest recorded work in which she incorporated these dots was a drawing in 1939 at age 10, in which the image of a Japanese woman in a kimono, presumed to be the artist&apos;s mother, is covered and obliterated by spots. { Yayoi Kusama, November 18, 1998 – January 8, 1999 Victoria Miro Gallery, London. } Her first series of large-scale, sometimes more than 30ft-long canvas paintings, { David Pilling (January 20, 2012), The world according to Yayoi Kusama } { Financial Times Weekend Magazine. } Infinity Nets, were entirely covered in a sequence of nets and dots that alluded to hallucinatory visions. In the early 1960s Kusama began to cover items such as ladders, shoes and chairs with white phallic protrusions. { Yayoi Kusama MoMA Collection, New York. } Since 1963, Kusama has continued her series of Mirror/Infinity rooms. In these complex installations, purpose-built rooms lined with mirrored glass contain scores of neon coloured balls, hanging at various heights above the viewer. Standing inside on a small platform, light is repeatedly reflected off the mirrored surfaces to create the illusion of a never-ending space. { Yayoi Kusama: &apos;&apos;Soul under the moon&apos;&apos; (2002) Queensland Art Gallery, Queensland. } [ New York City: 1957 &amp; amp;ndash;1972 ] After living in Tokyo and France, Kusama left Japan at the age of 27 for New York City, following correspondence with Georgia O&apos;Keeffe in which she became interested in joining the limelight in the city. [ Bitch magazine Yayoi Kusama http://bitchmagazine.org/post/yayoi-kusama Belin Liu February 26, 2009 November 30, 2010 ] During her time in the U.S., she quickly established her reputation as a leader in the avant-garde movement. In 1961 she moved her studio into the same building as Donald Judd and sculptor Eva Hesse; Hesse became a close friend. During the following years, she was enormously productive, and by 1966, she was experimenting with room-size, freestanding installations that incorporated mirrors, lights, and piped-in music. She counted Judd and Joseph Cornell among her friends and supporters. However, she did not profit financially from her work. Around this time, Kusama was hospitalised regularly from overwork, and O’Keeffe convinced her own dealer Edith Herbert to purchase several works in order to help Kusama stave off financial hardship. { Yayoi Kusama Timeline Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. } Kusama organized outlandish happenings in conspicuous spots like Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge, often involving nudity and designed to protest the Vietnam War. In one, she wrote an open letter to Richard Nixon offering to have sex with him if he would stop the Vietnam war. { David Pilling (January 20, 2012), The world according to Yayoi Kusama } { Financial Times Weekend Magazine. } Between 1967 and 1969 she concentrated on performances held with the maximum publicity, usually involving Kusama painting polka dots on her naked performers, as in the Grand Orgy to Awaken the Dead at the MOMA (1969), which took place at the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. { Yayoi Kusama MoMA Collection, New York. } In 1968, Kusama presided over the happening Homosexual Wedding at the Church of Self-obliteration in 33 Walker Street in New York, and performed alongside Fleetwood Mac and Country Joe and the Fish at the Fillmore East, New York City. { Yayoi Kusama Timeline Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. } In 1966, Kusama first participated in the 33rd Venice Biennale. Her Narcissus Garden comprised hundreds of mirrored spheres outdoors in what she called a &apos;kinetic carpet&apos;. As soon as the piece was installed on a lawn outside the Italian pavilion, Kusama, dressed in a golden kimono, { David Pilling (January 20, 2012), The world according to Yayoi Kusama } { Financial Times Weekend Magazine. } began selling each individual sphere for 1,200 lire ($2), until the Biennale organisers put an end to her enterprise. Perhaps one of Kusama&apos;s most notorious works, Narcissus Garden was as much about the promotion of the artist through the media as it was an opportunity to offer a critique of the mechanisation and commodification of the art market. Various versions of Narcissus Garden have been presented worldwide venues including Le Consortium, Dijon, 2000; Kunstverein Braunschweig, 2003; as part of the Whitney Biennial in Central Park, New York in 2004; and at the Jardin de Tuileries in Paris, 2010. { Yayoi Kusama: Flowers That Bloom Tomorrow, October 7, – November 13, 2010 Victoria Miro Gallery, London. } During her time in New York, Kusama had a decade-long sexless relationship with the American artist Joseph Cornell, Kusama&apos;s only recorded romantic attachment to date. [ Return to Japan: 1973 &amp; amp;ndash;present ] [ right Orchard Road 3, Singapore Biennale 2006, Oct  06.JPG 150 Yayoi Kusama - Ascension of Polkadots on the Trees.JPG 150 Yayoi Kusama&apos;s Ascension of Polka Dots on the Treesat the Singapore Biennale 2006 on Orchard Road, Singapore. ] In 1973, Kusama returned to Japan in ill health, where she began writing shockingly visceral and surrealistic novels, short stories, and poetry. Kusama checked herself into the Seiwa Hospital for the Mentally Ill and eventually took up permanent residence. She has been living at the hospital since, by choice. Her studio, where she has continued to produce work since the mid-1970s, is a short distance from the hospital in Shinjuku, Tokyo. [ Sydney Morning Herald John McDonald Points of no return http://www.smh.com.au/news/Arts/Points-of-no-return/2005/02/11/1108061857857.html February 12, 2005 November 30, 2010 ] Kusama is often quoted as saying: &quot; If it were not for art, I would have killed myself a long time ago. &quot; { 2007 interview at ArtReview.com } Yayoi Kusama said about her 1954 painting titled Flower (D.S.P.S), [ February 2010 ] One day I was looking at the red flower patterns of the tablecloth on a table, and when I looked up I saw the same pattern covering the ceiling, the windows and the walls, and finally all over the room, my body and the universe. I felt as if I had begun to self-obliterate, to revolve in the infinity of endless time and the absoluteness of space, and be reduced to nothingness. As I realized it was actually happening and not just in my imagination, I was frightened. I knew I had to run away lest I should be deprived of my life by the spell of the red flowers. I ran desperately up the stairs. The steps below me began to fall apart and I fell down the stairs straining my ankle. Another quote of hers: &quot;...a polka-dot has the form of the sun, which is a symbol of the energy of the whole world and our living life, and also the form of the moon, which is calm. Round, soft, colorful, senseless and unknowing. Polka-dots become movement... Polka dots are a way to infinity. &quot; Yayoi Kusama, Manhattan jisatsu misui joshuhan (Manhattan Suicide Addict),Kosakusha, Tokyo, 1978, (extract) reproduced in Hoptman et al., Yayoi Kusama, p.124. Her organically abstract paintings of one or two colors (the Infinity Nets series), which she began upon arriving in New York, garnered comparisons to the work of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman. When she left New York she was practically forgotten as an artist until the late 1980s and 1990s, when a number of retrospectives revived international interest. { Yayoi Kusama MoMA Collection, New York. } Following the success of the Japanese pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1993  – a dazzling mirrored room filled with small pumpkin sculptures in which she resided in color-coordinated magician&apos;s attire  – Kusama went on to produce a huge, yellow pumpkin sculpture covered with an optical pattern of black spots. The pumpkin came to represent for her a kind of alter-ego or self-portrait. { Kusama, April 16 – June 27, 2009 } { Gagosian Gallery, New York/Los Angeles. } Kusama&apos;s later installation I&apos;m Here, but Nothing, (2000–2008) is a simply furnished room consisting of table and chairs, place settings and bottles, armchairs and rugs, however its walls are tattooed with hundreds of fluorescent polka dots glowing in the UV light. The result is an endless infinite space where the self and everything in the room is obliterated. { Yayoi Kusama, February 7, – March 20, 2008 Victoria Miro Gallery, London. } The multi-part floating work Guidepost to the New Space, a series of rounded “humps” in fire-engine red with white polka dots, was displayed in Pandanus Lake [ Works ] [ Writing ] In 1977, Kusama published a book of poems and paintings entitled 7. One year later, her first novel Manhattan Suicide Addict appeared. Between 1983 and 1990, she finished the novels The Hustler’s Grotto of Christopher Street (1983), The Burning of St Mark’s Church (1985), Between Heaven and Earth (1988), Woodstock Phallus Cutter (1988), Aching Chandelier (1989), Double Suicide at Sakuragazuka (1989), and Angels in Cape Cod (1990), alongside several issues of the magazine S &amp; M Sniper in collaboration with photographer Nobuyoshi Araki. { Yayoi Kusama Timeline Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. } [ Film ] In 1968, the film “Kusama’s Self-Obliteration” which Kusama produced and starred in won a prize at the Fourth International Experimental Film Competition in Belgium and the Second Maryland Film Festival and the second prize at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. In 1991, Kusama starred in the film Tokyo Decadence, written and directed by Ryu Murakami, and in 1993, she collaborates with British musician Peter Gabriel on an installation in Yokohama. { Yayoi Kusama Timeline Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. } &apos;&apos;Red Pumpkin&apos;&apos; (2006), Naoshima [ Fashion ] In 1968, Kusama established Kusama Fashion Company Ltd., and began selling avantgarde fashion in the &quot; Kusama Corner &quot; at Bloomingdales. { Midori Matsui, Interview: Yayoi Kusama, 1998 Index Magazine. } In 2009, Kusama designed a handbag-shaped cell phone called C-top, and My Doggie Ring-Ring, an accompanying dog-shaped holder, for a limited edition of Japan’s mobile communication giant KDDI Corporation ’s “iida“ brand. { Art Editions: Yayoi Kusama KDDI Corporation. } In 2011, Kusama created artwork for six limited-edition lipglosses from Lancôme. { Emili Vesilind (May 24, 2011), Lancôme collaborates with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama on new Juicy Tubes } { Los Angeles Times. } That same year, she worked with Marc Jacobs (who visited her studio in Japan in 2006) on a line of Louis Vuitton products, including leather goods, ready-to-wear, accessories, shoes, watches, and jewelry. { Ann Binlot (January 9, 2012), Marc Jacobs Recruits Yayoi Kusama for Latest Louis Vuitton Collaboration ARTINFO. } [ Commissions ] &apos;&apos;Narcissus Garden&apos;&apos; (2009), Instituto Inhotim To date, Kusama has completed several major outdoor sculptural commissions, mostly in the form of brightly hued monstrous plants and flowers, for public and private institutions including Pumpkin (1994) for the Fukuoka Municipal Museum of Art; The Visionary Flowers (2002) for the Matsumoto City Museum of Art; Tsumari in Bloom (2003) for Matsudai Station, Niigata; Tulipes de Shangri-La (2003) for Euralille in Lille, France; Pumpkin (2006) at Bunka-mura on Benesse Island of Naoshima; Hello, Anyang with Love (2007) for Pyeonghwa Park, Anyang; and The Hymn of Life: Tulips (2007) for the Beverly Gardens Park in Los Angeles. { Kusama, April 16 – June 27, 2009 } { Gagosian Gallery, New York/Los Angeles. } In 1998, she realized a mural for the hallway of Gare do Oriente subway station in Lisbon. Alongside these monumental works, she has produced smaller scale outdoor pieces including Key-Chan and Ryu-Chan, a pair of dotted dogs. All the outdoor works are cast in highly durable fiberglass-reinforced plastic, then painted in urethane to glossy perfection. { Yayoi Kusama: Outdoor Sculptures, June 23, – July 25, 2009 Victoria Miro Gallery, London. } In 2010, Kusama designed a Town Sneaker-model bus, which she titled Mizutama Ranbu (Wild Polka Dot Dance) and whose route travels through her home town of Matsumoto. { Yayoi Kusama Timeline Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. } In 2011, she was commissioned to design the front cover of millions of pocket London Underground maps; the result is entitled Polka Dots Festival in London (2011). [ Exhibitions ] { Mattress Factory Art Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania } In 1959, Kusama had her first solo exhibition in New York at the Brata Gallery, an artist&apos;s co-op. She showed a series of white net paintings which were enthusiastically reviewed by Donald Judd (both Judd and Frank Stella then acquired paintings from the show). { Yayoi Kusama, November 18, 1998 – January 8, 1999 Victoria Miro Gallery, London. } Kusama has since exhibited work with, among others, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Jasper Johns. In 1962, she was the only female artist to take part in the widely acclaimed &apos;Nul&apos; (Zero) international group exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. She represented Japan at the Venice Biennale in 1993, and in 1998–1999 a major retrospective exhibition of her work toured the U.S. and Japan.

As of July 2011, several of Kusama&apos;s most intimate works are on display at the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid, Spain. As part of FINA Festival 2007, Kusama created Guidepost to the New Space, a vibrant outdoor installation for Birrarung Marr beside the Yarra River in Melbourne. In 2009, the Guideposts were re-installed at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, this time displayed as floating “humps” on a lake. { “Yayoi Kusama at Fairchild”, December 5, 2009 – May 30, 2010 } { Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. } An exhibition of Kusama&apos;a work opened at the Tate Modern in London on February 9, 2012. { Tate Modern http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/yayoikusama/default.shtm Accessed: February 14, 2012 } Described as &apos;akin to being suspended in a beautiful cosmos gazing at infinite worlds, or like a tiny dot of fluoresecent plankton in an ocean of glowing microscopic life&apos; { Trebuchet Magazine http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/tate_modern_yayoi_kusama/ }, the exhibition features work from Kusama&apos;s entire career.
