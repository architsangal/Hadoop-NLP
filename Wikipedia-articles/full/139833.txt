The population was 660 at the 2000 census. The census-designated place of Westboro is located in the town. The unincorporated community of Queenstown is also located in the town. [ Geography ] Westboro is the largest town in Taylor County. Instead of the typical six miles by six, it is six by twenty miles. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 125.4  square miles (324.9  km²), of which, 124.1  square miles (321.4  km²) of it is land and 1.3  square miles (3.5  km²) of it (1.07%) is water. [ History ] In 1847, surveyors working for the U.S. government walked the six mile squares that would become the town of Westboro. They marked off the outline of the town on foot using compass and chain. A crew came back in 1858 to survey all the section lines.
