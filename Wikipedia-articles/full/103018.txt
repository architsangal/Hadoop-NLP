It is the second film adaptation of Harry Segall &apos;s stageplay of the same name, preceded by Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941) and followed by Down to Earth (2001). Beatty stars in the lead role, playing a football player who, after being killed in a collision accident, is sent back to earth in the body of a millionaire. [ Plot ] Joe Pendleton ( Warren Beatty ), a backup quarterback for the American football team Los Angeles Rams, is looking forward to leading his team to the Super Bowl. He is riding a bicycle through the Mulholland Drive tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles when he collides with a truck. An over-anxious guardian angel ( Buck Henry ) on his first assignment plucks Joe out of his body early in the mistaken belief that his death is imminent, and Pendleton arrives in the afterlife. Once there, he refuses to believe that his time was up, and upon investigation, the mysterious Mr. Jordan ( James Mason ) discovers that he is right; he was not destined to die until much later. Unfortunately, his body has already been cremated, so a new body must be found. After rejecting several possibilities (men who are about to die), Joe is finally persuaded to accept the body of millionaire industrialist Leo Farnsworth. Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his wife Julia ( Dyan Cannon ) and her lover, Farnsworth&apos;s personal secretary, Tony Abbott ( Charles Grodin ). Julia and Tony are naturally confused when Farnsworth reappears, alive and well. Leo Farnsworth buys the Los Angeles Rams in order to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback. In order to succeed, he must first convince, and then secure the aid of, long-time friend and trainer Max Corkle ( Jack Warden ) to get his new body into shape. At the same time, he falls in love with an environmental activist, Betty Logan ( Julie Christie ), who disapproves of Farnsworth&apos;s policies and actions. As the film&apos;s plotline heads toward the Super Bowl, the characters all face a crisis. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott shoots Farnsworth dead. The Rams are forced to start another quarterback, Thomas Jarrett, in the climactic football game. After a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is himself killed. With Mr. Jordan&apos;s help, Joe then occupies his final body, that of Jarrett. Joe, in Jarrett&apos;s body, is shown leading the Rams to victory. During the team&apos;s post-game victory celebration, Mr. Jordan removes Joe&apos;s memory of his past life and departs. Joe becomes Thomas Jarrett and the cosmic balance is restored; the winning quarterback, Jarrett, is shown meeting Betty after the celebrations have ended, and as the film ends it is strongly implied that they are falling in love as a result of a mutual sense of déjà vu.

Bryant Gumbel is seen in the background of one scene &apos;on the box&apos;, delivering a TV sportscast. Curt Gowdy and Al DeRogatis can be heard doing the Super Bowl play-by-play commentary. Dick Enberg conducts an abortive post-game interview of Joe Pendleton/Tom Jarrett. Beatty had lobbied hard for Cary Grant to accept the role of Mr. Jordan, going so far as to have Grant&apos;s ex-wife, Dyan Cannon, urge him to take the part. But although Grant was tempted, he ultimately decided not to end his retirement from filmmaking. Future game show host Peter Tomarken appears as a reporter in the film. [ Production ] Beatty had initially wanted Muhammed Ali to play the central character, but due to Ali&apos;s continued commitment to boxing, Beatty changed the character from a boxer to an American football player and played it himself.

[ Legacy ] The year after the film&apos;s release, &apos;life imitated art&apos; when the Rams made the Super Bowl and played the Pittsburgh Steelers, their fictional opponents in this film. (No Hollywood ending, however: in Super Bowl XIV, the Rams lost 31-19.)
