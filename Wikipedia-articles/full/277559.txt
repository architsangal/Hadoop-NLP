Currently drumming for Brawley Banks and a reunited Sunny Day Real Estate, he has toured with Mike Watt, IQU, and has recorded and played live with many other bands and artists. [ Early years ] Goldsmith was born in Seattle, Washington to Hugh and Skitty Goldsmith. He began playing drums as a child, citing Keith Moon of the Who as his biggest influence. { William Goldsmith: Artist Update: Modern Drummer Magazine 25 March 2008 } [ Sunny Day Real Estate (1992-1995) ] In 1992, Goldsmith founded the band Sunny Day Real Estate in Seattle with bassist Nate Mendel and Dan Hoerner on guitar and vocals. The band soon recruited Jeremy Enigk, a high school friend of Goldsmith&apos;s as their new frontman. They recorded two studio albums, both released on the well-known independent label Sub Pop, that were greeted with positive critical reviews and brought about newfound popularity for the emo genre before they disbanded in 1995. [ Foo Fighters (1995-1997) ] Goldsmith and Mendel then joined former Nirvana member Dave Grohl &apos;s new band, Foo Fighters, along with former Germs guitarist Pat Smear. In 1995, they embarked on a tour in support of the band&apos;s already-released debut album (Grohl had recorded nearly all instruments for the album by himself). The album was a massive hit, spawning five hit singles. After touring through the spring of 1996, the full lineup entered a Seattle studio with producer Gil Norton to record the band&apos;s second album. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him on a trip home to Virginia. While there, Grohl realized that he wasn&apos;t happy with how the mixes were turning out, and began demoing newer songs by himself at a studio in Washington, DC. &quot; Everlong &quot; and &quot; Walking After You &quot; were recorded by Grohl with him playing all instruments, and this version of &quot; Walking After You &quot; was the one used for the album. The band regrouped in Los Angeles in February 1997 and almost completely re-recorded the album, this time with Grohl on drums, not telling Goldsmith about the session at all. Goldsmith later found out through bassist Mendel. Feeling betrayed and suffering the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome, he decided to leave the band soon thereafter; he was replaced on drums by Taylor Hawkins. The finished album, The Colour and the Shape, was released on May 20, 1997. As a result of this, Goldsmith actually recorded little material that would be released by Foo Fighters in spite of being a member of the band from 1995 through 1997. Most of what little material he recorded with them was discarded. In fact, he can only be heard on three tracks from The Colour and the Shape: &quot; Doll &quot;, &quot; Up in Arms &quot; (the slow beginning), and the verses of &quot; My Poor Brain &quot;. Additionally, he also played on &quot; Dear Lover &quot;, the song &quot; The Colour and the Shape &quot;, and the Gary Numan cover &quot; Down in the Park &quot;, as well as on various live bootlegs and demos. [ Back with Sunny Day Real Estate (1997-2001) ] In 1997, Sub Pop had approached Hoerner and Enigk about releasing a compilation of Sunny Day Real Estate rarities. Instead, the band decided to reunite and release a new studio album, 1998&apos;s How It Feels To Be Something On. While Goldsmith, who had by this time left Foo Fighters, took part in the reunion, Mendel remained with Foo Fighters. Goldsmith also drummed with Sunny Day Real Estate on their subsequent live album, which was their last recording for Sub Pop, and their 2000 studio album The Rising Tide (for Time Bomb Recordings ). After completing an extensive tour of the United States, the band hoped to tour Europe for the first time, but Time Bomb could not afford to support such a tour; the label soon ceased operations, resulting in the band&apos;s 2001 breakup. [ After Sunny Day Real Estate, other projects, and reunion (2001-present) ] After Sunny Day Real Estate disbanded for a second time, Goldsmith and Enigk formed The Fire Theft with original Sunny Day bassist Nate Mendel. An album and tour followed. Around the same time, Goldsmith joined guitarist Billy Dolan, who had played on the Fire Theft album and tour, for a project called Varicocele. The band recorded about 30 songs, and presented them to Jonathan Poneman at Sub Pop, who declined to release them. In 2008, Goldsmith formed Brawley Banks with Justin Schwartz and Jorum Young from Cobra High. In 2009 they played their first show. In June 2009, it was confirmed that Sunny Day Real Estate would be reuniting once again with the original line-up. { http://www.earcandybeat.com/?q=node/61 } { http://perfectlines.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/sunny-day-real-estate-reunion-in-2009/ } A tour began later that year. { http://www.subpop.com/tours/sunny_day_real_estate/ } In early 2010, guitarist Dan Hoerner stated that a new album is in the works. { http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/22353/Sunny-Day-Real-Estate.htm } [ Equipment ] During the bulk of his time with Sunny Day Real Estate and Foo Fighters, William played an Ayotte drum kit with Zildjian cymbals. His exact setup was as follows: [ Drums ] 14 &quot; x 7 &quot; SteelHoop Snare Drum 15 &quot; x14 &quot; Tom Tom 18 &quot; x16 &quot; Floor Tom 24 &quot; x 20 &quot; Bass Drum [ Cymbals ] 15 &quot; Zildjian A Rock Hi-Hat 20 &quot; Zildjian K Crash/Ride 22 &quot; Zildjian A Crash/Ride 24 &quot; Zildjian A Medium Ride He has also played with DW, Yamaha, Pearl, Slingerland, and Vistalite kits.
