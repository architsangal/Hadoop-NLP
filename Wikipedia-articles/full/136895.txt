The population was 12,729 at the 2010 United States Census. Of 566 municipalities statewide, Ridgefield Park is one of only four with a village type of government in New Jersey. It operates a City Commission form of government. Of the four New Jersey villages only Loch Arbour retains the village form of government, while Ridgewood operates under the Council-Manager form and the Township of South Orange Village operates under a Special Charter form with many characteristics of village government. { Cerra, Michael F. &quot; Forms of Government &quot;, New Jersey Municipalities (publication of the } { New Jersey State League of Municipalities ), March 2007. Accessed August 5, 2008. } Ridgefield Park was formed as a village on June 15, 1892, within Ridgefield Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on June 6, 1892. Overpeck Township was formed on March 23, 1897 to be coextensive with Ridgefield Park village, and was created within Ridgefield Township for the purpose of administering a Board of Education. Portions of the village were taken gained in both 1921 and 1926 from Bogota and Teaneck. On May 31, 1938, Ridgefield Township became Ridgefield Park Township. { Snyder, John P. &apos;&apos;The Story of New Jersey&apos;s Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968&apos;&apos;, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 85.

Residents of the village took seriously the suggestion made years before by John Adams that the nation&apos;s citizenry to celebrate independence with parades, fireworks and joyous gatherings. Volunteer committees have put together an observance every year since 1894 in spite of two World Wars, the Great Depression and other distractions. &quot; } The village eliminated its July 4 fireworks in 2009, citing the $50,000 cost in the face of the difficult economy, but committed to retain its parade. { Kocieniewski, David. &quot; Bad Economy Dampens Celebrations for July 4th &quot;, } { The New York Times, June 21, 2009.

Fosdick. “But if you’re confronting a situation where you’re afraid you may have to lay people off and cost a family its livelihood, then it’s a decision that you have to make.” Mr. Fosdick said the village would hold the rest of its Independence Day celebration, including its home- and business-decorating contest and two parades. &quot; } [ Geography ] Ridgefield Park is located at [ 40.854705 -74.019926 type:city_region:US-NJ dms inline ] (40.854705,-74.019926).
