Show } Courage the Cowardly Dog is an American animated television series created by John R. Dilworth for Cartoon Network. Its central plot revolves around a somewhat anthropomorphic dog named Courage who lives with his owners, Muriel and Eustace Bagge, an elderly, married farming couple in the &quot; Middle of Nowhere &quot; (the fictional town of Nowhere, Kansas). Courage and his owners are frequently thrown into bizarre misadventures, often involving the paranormal/supernatural and various villains. The show is often noted for its surreal, often disquieting humor and bizarre plot twists. The series combines elements of black comedy, comedy horror, science fantasy, surrealism and sometimes drama. It is rated TV-Y7. The program originated from a short on Cartoon Network &apos;s animation showcase series created by Hanna-Barbera president Fred Seibert, &quot; What A Cartoon! &quot; titled &quot; The Chicken from Outer Space &quot;. { {{cite news|last=Mendoza|first=N.F.|title=SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO : Cartoon Network stars a hen from outer space; &apos;HumWorld Premiere Toons, and it was the eighth series to fall under the } { Cartoon Cartoons label. } On April 20, 2012, this series returned to Cartoon Network in re-runs on the revived block, &quot; Cartoon Planet &quot;.

Abandoned as a puppy, Courage was adopted by Muriel Bagge (a sweet-natured Scottish woman), and her husband Eustace (a grumpy, greedy farmer who enjoys scaring Courage with a large, bright green, bug-eyed mask). Courage, Eustace, and Muriel frequently run into monster s, aliens, demon s, mad scientist s, zombie s, and other perils that Courage must fend off to save his owners. Although most of the creatures that the three face are frightening or disturbing, some turn out to be sweet or simply in distress. [ Production ] [ The animated short ] Originally, Courage the Cowardly Dog was created as a seven-minute animated short, &quot; The Chicken from Outer Space &quot;. [ 4 8 Miller Bob The Triumphant Independent - an interview with John R. Dilworth Animation World Network 10 July 2011 November 1, 1999 http://www.awn.com/articles/people/triumphant-independent ] Dilworth started the animated short with Hanna-Barbera, sponsored by Cartoon Network and introduced Courage. Teletoon Dilworth graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1985. He became an art director and founded his own animation studio, Stretch Films in 1991, and incorporated in 1994. The animated short was shown as one of the episodes of Cartoon Network&apos;s World Premiere Toons in 1996, a Hanna-Barbera Cartoons innovation by then-president Fred Seibert.

The original animated short had no dialogue except for one line spoken by Courage, who had a more authoritative voice than in the series. An alien chicken was the villain in this short, and it would later reappear in the series to seek its revenge.
