The series first appeared in French in the magazine Pilote on October 29, 1959. As of 2009, 34 comic books in the series have been released. The series follows the exploits of a village of indomitable Gaul s as they resist Roman occupation. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonist, the titular character Asterix, along with his friend Obelix have various adventures. The &quot; ix &quot; suffix of both names echoes the name of Vercingetorix, a historical Gaul chieftain. In many cases, the stories have them travel to various countries around the world, though other books are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village. The Asterix series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into over 100 languages, and it is popular in most Europe an countries. Asterix is less well known in the United States and Japan. The success of the series has led to the adaptation of several books into 14 films : ten animated, and four with live actors. There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, Parc Astérix, is themed around the series. To date, 325  million copies of 34 Asterix books have been sold worldwide, making co-creators René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo France&apos;s bestselling authors abroad.

[ http://lambiek.net/home.htm René Goscinny Comic creator 9 March 2010 ] Astérix was originally serialised in the magazine Pilote, in the very first issue published on 29 October 1959. [ BDoubliées Pilote année 1959 http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/series1/asterix.htm French ] In 1961 the first book was put together entitled Asterix the Gaul. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Uderzo&apos;s first sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind. He visualized Asterix as a shrewd small sized warrior who would prefer intelligence over strength. However, Uderzo felt that the small sized hero needed a strong but dim companion to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born. [ Kessler Peter Asterix Complete Guide 11 March 2010 First 2 1995 Nov Hodder Children&apos;s Books; 0-340-65346-9 ] Despite the growing popularity of Asterix with the readers, the financial backing for Pilote ceased. Pilote was taken over by Georges Dargaud. When Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued the series alone on the demand of the readers who implored him to continue. He continued the series but on a less frequent basis. Most critics and fans of the series prefer Goscinny&apos;s albums. Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions Albert-René, which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then. However, Dargaud, the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%). Although Uderzo declared he did not want anyone to continue the series after his death, which is similar to the request Hergé made regarding his The Adventures of Tintin, his attitude changed and in December 2008 he sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company and now own the rights. This has provoked a family row. [ http://techland.com/2009/01/21/an-open-letter-to-albert-uderzo/ An Open Letter to Albert Uderzo Matt Selman 21 January 2009 Techland.com 9 March 2010 ] In a letter published in the French newspaper Le Monde in 2009, Uderzo&apos;s daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father&apos;s decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new Astérix adventures after his death. She is reported as saying &quot;...the co-creator of Astérix, France’s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans - the men of industry and finance”.

It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on the occasion of his 80th birthday by 34 renowned European comics artists. The volume was translated into nine languages, but has not yet been translated into English.

Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Empire. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, Getafix. The main protagonist and hero of the village is Asterix, who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and unintelligent friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid&apos;s cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength. Obelix is usually accompanied by Dogmatix, his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix&apos;s dog&apos;s name is &quot; Dogmatix &quot; in English, but &quot; Idéfix &quot; in the original French edition.) Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul ( Lutetia, Corsica etc.), neighbouring nations ( Belgium, Spain, Britain, Germany etc.), and far away lands ( North America, Middle East, India etc.). The series employs science-fiction and fantasy elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of extraterrestrials in Asterix and the Falling Sky and the city of Atlantis in Asterix and Obelix All at Sea. [ Humour ] The humour encountered in the Asterix comics is typically French [ September 2011 ], often centering on puns, caricatures, and tongue-in-cheek stereotype s of contemporary European nations and French regions. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionnaires are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix&apos;s famous &quot; Ils sont fous ces romains &quot; ( &quot; These Romans are crazy &quot; ) is translated as &quot; Sono pazzi questi romani &quot;, alluding to the Roman abbreviation SPQR. In another example: Hiccups are written onomatopoeically in French as &quot; hips, &quot; but in English as &quot; hic, &quot; allowing Roman legionnaries in at least one of the English translations to decline their hiccups in Latin ( &quot; hic, haec, hoc &quot; ). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm The vital statistics of Asterix 18 October 2007 BBC News 10 March 2010 London ] In spite of (or perhaps because of) this stereotyping, and notwithstanding some alleged streaks of French chauvinism, the humour has been very well received by European and Francophone cultures around the world. [ Translations ] The 34 books or albums (one of which is a compendium of short stories) in the series have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects. Besides the original French, most albums are available in Estonian, English, Czech, Dutch, German, Galician, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese (and Brazilian Portuguese ), Italian, modern Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Slovene, Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, Latvian, and Welsh, as well as Latin. { http://www.asterix.com/encyclopedia/translations/asterix-in-latin.html } Some albums have also been translated into languages as diverse as Esperanto, Scots Gaelic, Indonesian, Persian, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Frisian, Romansch, Vietnamese, and Sinhala (Singhalese) and Ancient Greek.

Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume, Asterix the Gaul, was translated into local language Mirandese.

[ List of Asterix comics published in Greece by Mamouth Comix http://www.mamouthcomix.gr/asterix/index.html Greek ] In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the Romanesque dialect. In former Yugoslavia, &quot; Forum &quot; publishing house translated Corsican in &quot; Asterix in Corsica &quot; into Montenegrin dialect of Serbo-Croatian (today called Montenegrin language ). In the Netherlands several volumes were translated into Frisian, a language related to Old English spoken in the province of Friesland. Also in the Netherlands two volumes were translated into Limburgish, a regional language spoken not only in Dutch Limburg but also in Belgian Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Hungarian -language books have been issued in Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia. Although not a fully autonomic dialect, it slightly differs from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into Sinhala (Singhalese) as Sura Pappa, the only Sri Lankan translation of a foreign cartoon that managed to keep the spirit of the original series intact. Most volumes have been translated into Latin and Ancient Greek with accompanying teachers&apos; guides as a way of teaching these ancient languages. [ English translation ] [ English translations of Asterix ] The translation of the books into English has been done by Derek Hockridge and Anthea Bell, and their English language rendition has been widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French version.

In the UK in 1995, Asterix coins were presented free in every Nutella jar. Asterix and Obelix appeared on the cover of Time Magazine for a special edition about France. In a 2009 issue of the same magazine, Asterix is described as being seen by some as a symbol for France&apos;s independence and defiance of globalisation.
