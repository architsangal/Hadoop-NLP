The official language of the Republic of India is Hindi with English as an additional language for official work; { 1. } { Schwartzberg, Joseph E., 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica, India —Linguistic Composition. Quote: &quot; By far the most widely spoken is Hindi, the country&apos;s official language, with more than 300 million speakers. &quot; 2. Oldenburg, Phillip. (1997-2007) Encarta Encyclopedia &quot; India: Official Languages. &quot; Quote: &quot; Hindi is the main language of more than 40 percent of the population. No single language other than Hindi can claim speakers among even 10 percent of the total population. Hindi was therefore made India’s official language in 1965. English, which was associated with British rule, was retained as an option for official use because some non-Hindi speakers, particularly in Tamil Nādu, opposed the official use of Hindi. &quot; 3. United Kingdom, Foreign and Commonwealth Office: India —Country Profile. Quote: &quot; The official language of India is Hindi written in the Devanagari script and spoken by some 30% of the population as a first language. Since 1965 English has been recognised as an &apos;associated language&apos;. &quot; 4. UNESCO: Education for All —The Nine Largest Countries Quote: &quot; Hindi is the language of 30% of the population and the official language of India. &quot; 5. United States Library of Congress, Federal Research Division, Country Profile: India Quote: &quot; Languages: Hindi is the official language and the most commonly spoken, but not all dialects are mutually comprehensible. English also has official status and is widely used in business and politics, although knowledge of English varies widely from fluency to knowledge of just a few words. &quot; 6 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Country Profile: India some idians have a hard time understanding one a anotherQuote: &quot; Hindi is constitutionally designated as the official language of India, with English as an associate official language. &quot; } states in India can legislate their own official languages. Neither the Constitution of India, nor any Indian law defines any national language. { There&apos;s no national language in India: Gujarat High Court } States specify their own official language(s) through legislation. The section of the Constitution of India dealing with official languages therefore includes detailed provisions { Part XVII of the Constitution of India. } which deal not just with the languages used for the official purposes of the union, { Article 343 of the Constitution of India. } but also with the languages that are to be used for the official purposes of each state and union territory in the country, { Article 345 of the Constitution of India. } and the languages that are to be used for communication between the union and the states inter se. { Article 346 of the Constitution of India. } During the British Raj, English was used for most official purposes both at the federal level and in the various states. [ Mollin Sandra Euro-English: assessing variety status 2006 Gunter Narr Verlag 978-3-8233-6250-0 17 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DqPhULmMmqJMC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA17 ] The Indian constitution adopted in 1950, envisaged the gradual phasing in of Hindi, to replace English over a fifteen-year period, but gave Parliament the power to, by law, provide for the continued use of English even thereafter. { Kanchan Chandra, “Ethnic Bargains, Group Instability, and Social Choice Theory,” Politics and Society 29, 3: 337-62. } But resistance to making Hindi the sole official language has resulted in English being retained for official uses. English continues to be used today, in combination with Hindi (at the central level and in some states) and other languages (at the state level). The legal framework governing the use of languages for official purpose currently includes the Constitution, the Official Languages Act, 1963, Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) Rules, 1976, and various state law s, as well as rules and regulations made by the central government and the states. [ Official languages of the Union ] The Indian constitution, in 1950, declared Hindi in Devanagari script to be the official language of the union. { Article 343(1). } Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e., on 26 January 1965. { Articles 343(2) and (3). } The prospect of the changeover, however, led to much alarm in the non Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially Dravidian -speaking states whose languages were not related to Hindi at all. As a result, Parliament enacted the Official Languages Act, 1963, { DOL } { Commissioner Linguistic Minorities } { Language in India } { THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES ACT, 1963 } { National Portal of India : Know India : Profile } { Committee of Parliament on Official Language report } which provided for the continued use of English for official purposes along with Hindi, even after 1965. In late 1964, an attempt was made to expressly provide for an end to the use of English, but it was met with protests from states such as Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka, Pondicherry and Andhra Pradesh. Some of these protests also turned violent. { Hardgrave, Robert L. (August 1965). &quot; The Riots in Tamilnad: Problems and Prospects of India&apos;s Language Crisis &quot;. Asian Survey (University of California Press) } As a result, the proposal was dropped, [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C940936%2C00.html The force of words 2007-06-05 Time 1965-02-19 ] [ Forrester Duncan B. The Madras Anti-Hindi Agitation, 1965: Political Protest and its Effects on Language Policy in India Pacific Affairs 39 1/2 19–36 Spring  — Summer 1966 10.2307/2755179 ] {. } and the Act itself was amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English would not be ended until a resolution to that effect was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as its official language, and by each house of the Indian Parliament. { Official Languages Act, 1963, S. 3(5). } The current position is thus that the Union government may continue to use English in addition to Hindi for its official purposes { Official Languages Act, 1963, S. 3(1). } as a &quot; subsidiary official language, &quot; { Notification No. 2/8/60-O.L. (Ministry of Home Affairs), dated 27th April, 1960. } but is also required to prepare and execute a programme to progressively increase its use of Hindi. { Official Languages Resolution, 1968, para. 1. } The exact extent to which, and the areas in which, the Union government uses Hindi and English, respectively, is determined by the provisions of the Constitution, the Official Languages Act, 1963, the Official Languages Rules, 1976, and statutory instrument s made by the Department of Official Language under these laws. [ Parliamentary proceedings and laws ] The Indian constitution draws a distinction between the language to be used in Parliamentary proceedings, and the language in which laws are to be made. Parliamentary business, according to the Constitution, may be conducted in either Hindi or English. { Article 120(1). } The use of English in parliamentary proceedings was to be phased out at the end of fifteen years unless Parliament chose to extend its use, { Article 120(2). } which Parliament did through the Official Languages Act, 1963. { Official Languages Act, 1963, S. 3(1)(b). } In addition, the constitution permits a person who is unable to express himself in either Hindi or English to, with the permission of the Speaker of the relevant House, address the House in his mother tongue. { Article 120(1) first proviso. } In contrast, the constitution requires the authoritative text of all laws, including Parliamentary enactment s and statutory instruments, to be in English, until Parliament decides otherwise. { Article 348(1). } Parliament has not exercised its power to so decide, instead merely requiring that all such laws and instruments, and all bill s brought before it, also be translated into Hindi, though the English text remains authoritative. { Official Languages Act, 1963, Ss. 5(1) and (2). } [ Judiciary ] The constitution provides that all proceedings in the Supreme Court of India, the country&apos;s highest court and the High Courts, shall be in English. { Article 348(1)(a). } Parliament has the power to alter this by law, but has not done so. { Article 348(1), leading text. } [ Administration ] The Union government is required by law to progressively increase the use of Hindi in its official work, which it has sought to do through &quot; persuasion, incentive and goodwill. &quot; { &quot; Official language policy of the Union. &quot; } The Official Language Act provides that the Union government shall use both Hindi and English in most administrative documents that are intended for the public. { S. 3(3) names, amongst others, resolutions, general orders, rules, notifications, administrative or other } { report s or } { press communiques issued by a } { government department, } { agency or } { corporation; administrative and other reports and official papers laid before a House or the Houses of Parliament; and } { contract s and agreements executed, and licences, permits, notices and forms of tender issued by or on behalf of the government (including government companies). } The Official Languages Rules, in contrast, provide for a higher degree of use of Hindi in communications between office s of the central government (other than offices in Tamil Nadu, to which the rules do not apply { Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) Rules, 1976, paragraph 1(ii) } ). Communications between different departments within the central government may be in either Hindi or English, although a translation into the other language must be provided if required. { Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) Rules, 1976, paragraph 4(a) } Communications within offices of the same department, however, must be in Hindi if the offices are in Hindi-speaking states, { Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) Rules, 1976, paragraphs 4(b) and (c) } and in either Hindi or English otherwise with Hindi being used in proportion to the percentage of staff in the receiving office who have a working knowledge of Hindi. { Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) Rules, 1976, paragraph 4(d) } Note s and memos in files may be in either Hindi or English, with the Government having a duty to provide a translation into the other language if required. { Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) Rules, 1976, paragraph 8 } In addition, every person submitting a petition for the redress of a grievance to a government officer or authority has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in India. { Constitution of India, Article 350. } [ Implementation ] Various steps have been taken by the Indian government to implement the use and familiarisation of Hindi extensively. Regional Hindi implementation offices at Bangalore, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Bhopal, Delhi and Ghaziabad have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs. A Kerala Hindi Prachara Sabha was also constituted and headquartered in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram for the same in Kerala. Similarly, Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha was formed to spread Hindi in South Indian states. Annual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the Kendriya Hindi Samiti (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices. [ Official Language - Constitutional/Statutory Provisions http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php Government of India ] [ State level ] The Indian constitution does not specify the official languages to be used by the states for the conduct of their official functions, and leaves each state free to, through its legislature, adopt Hindi or any language used in its territory as its official language or languages. { Constitution of India, Article 345 } The language need not be one of those listed in the Eighth Schedule, and several states have adopted official languages which are not so listed. Examples include Kokborok in Tripura; Mizo in Mizoram; Khasi and Garo in Meghalaya; and French in Pondicherry. [ Legislature and administration ] The constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the State level largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their official language, Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their mother tongue with the Speaker&apos;s permission. { Constitution of India, Article 210. } The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared. { Articles 348(1) and (3). } The state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in public administration, and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a petition for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status. In addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the President, the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of minority language s for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State&apos;s population desire its use. { Constitution of India, Article 347. } Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide primary education in the mother tongue for all linguistic minorities, regardless of whether or not their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities. { Constitution of India, Article 350A. } [ State judiciary ] States have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective High Courts will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state&apos;s official language in proceedings of the High Court to the Governor, rather than the state legislature, and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the President of India, { Constitution of India, Article 348(2). } who in these matters acts on the advice of the Government of India. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court&apos;s judgments will be delivered. { S. 7 } Four states - Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan { Language in Courts - a bridge or a barrier? } - have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi. However, the only non-Hindi state to seek a similar power - Tamil Nadu, which sought the right to conduct proceedings in Tamil in its High Court - had its application rejected by the central government earlier, which said it was advised to do so by the Supreme Court. [ Special Correspondent Karunanidhi stands firm on Tamil in High Court The Hindu 1 12 March 2007 http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/12/stories/2007031205180100.htm ] {. } In 2006, the law ministry said that it would not object to Tamil Nadu state&apos;s desire to conduct Madras High Court proceedings in Tamil. { The Hindu : Tamil Nadu / Thanjavur News : No objection to Tamil as court language: A.P.
