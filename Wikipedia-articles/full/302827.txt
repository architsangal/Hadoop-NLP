[ 1939 2 13 y ] { Melbourne, } { Victoria } { Kooyong } { Liberal Party } { University of Melbourne } { English } Andrew Sharp Peacock AC, GCL (born 13 February 1939), is a former Australia n Liberal politician. He was a minister in the Gorton, McMahon and Fraser governments, and was federal leader of the Liberal Party of Australia 1983–1985 and 1989–1990. He was Chairman of Octaviar Ltd, a Financial Services and Property Group based on the Gold Coast, Queensland during its collapse. [ Early life ] Peacock was born in Melbourne, Victoria, the son of a wealthy company director. He was educated at Scotch College and at the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in law. He practised law in Melbourne while making a rapid advance in the Liberal Party. He was president of the Young Liberals in 1962, and in 1963 he married Susan Rossiter (b. 1940), the daughter of Victorian Liberal MLA Sir John Rossiter { Rossiter, Sir John Frederick, Victorian Parliament page } and Joan Stewart. They had three daughters, one of them being the horse trainer Jane Chapple-Hyam. { Jane has pedigree to make grade, } { The Daily Telegraph, 7 July 2005 } By 1965 he was President of the Victorian Liberal Party. [ Early political career ] In February 1966, former Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies resigned, triggering a by-election in Kooyong, the eastern Melbourne electorate that he had held for 32 years. Peacock gained Liberal preselection and was elected on 2 April, with a reduced majority. He easily retained his seat in the general election held seven months later. In 1969 he was appointed Minister for the Army, and in this role played a minor part in the drama which brought down Prime Minister John Gorton in 1971. In 1972 William McMahon made him Minister for Territories, in charge of Australia&apos;s colonial possession, Papua New Guinea, where he was responsible for bringing in self-government. { Peacock made &apos;bird of paradise&apos; chief, } { Ninemsn, 19-Sep-2006 } When the Liberals went into opposition in December 1972, Peacock became a senior member of the Liberal frontbench. As a party moderate, he was a supporter of the new leader, Billy Snedden. When Snedden lost the 1974 election, Peacock began to be seen as a leadership candidate, but it was Malcolm Fraser who took the initiative and deposed Snedden in 1975. Fraser made Peacock foreign affairs spokesperson, and when Fraser led the Liberals back to power in December 1975 Peacock became Minister for Foreign Affairs, aged 36. He served as Foreign Minister until 1980, acquiring a reputation as an international playboy, particularly through his well-publicised relationship with Shirley MacLaine (his marriage had by this time ended in divorce). He had a number of acrimonious disputes with Fraser, particularly over the recognition of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. After the 1980 election he asked for a change of portfolio, and Fraser made him Minister for Industrial Relations. In April 1981 he suddenly resigned, accusing Fraser of constant interference in his portfolio. Fraser called a party meeting, at which Peacock tried to depose him as party leader and Prime Minister. Fraser managed to fend off this challenge. In November 1982, when Phillip Lynch resigned from politics, John Howard succeeded him as Deputy Leader, and Peacock was brought back into cabinet as Minister for Industry and Commerce. [ Leader of the Liberal Party ] Fraser&apos;s government was defeated in the March 1983 election by the Labor Party under Bob Hawke. Fraser immediately retired from politics, and Peacock contested the party leadership, defeating Howard, who remained as Deputy Leader. As Opposition Leader, Peacock faced an uphill battle against the hugely popular Hawke. At the 1984 election he was given little chance of winning, but he performed better than expected by reducing Hawke&apos;s majority. In 1985, as Labor&apos;s position in opinion polls improved, Peacock&apos;s popularity sank and Howard&apos;s profile rose, keeping leadership speculation alive. Peacock said he would no longer accept Howard as deputy unless he offered assurances that he would not challenge for the leadership. Following Howard&apos;s refusal to offer such an assurance, in September 1985 Peacock sought to replace him with John Moore as Deputy Leader. [ Political Chronicles: July to December 1985 Australian Journal of Politics and History p. 264 1986. ] The party room re-elected Howard as Deputy, contrary to Peacock&apos;s wishes. Despite possessing greater support in the parliamentary party than Howard, [ Kelly Paul Paul Kelly (journalist) The End of Certainty: Power, Politics, and Business in Australia http://books.google.com/?id%3DEKXBgmYeO2QC%26amp%3Bdq 2007-10-05 Allen &amp; Unwin 1-86373-757-X 192, 193 1994 ] Peacock unexpectedly resigned and Howard was comfortably elected Opposition Leader on 5 September. { Howard&apos;s labours are slipping away, Alan Ramsay, Sydney Morning Herald, 6 March 2004 } Howard appointed Peacock Shadow Foreign Minister. Howard lost the 1987 election to Hawke, and Peacock was elected Deputy Leader in a show of party unity. But Peacock&apos;s supporters began to plot against Howard, and in May 1989 they mounted a party room coup which returned Peacock to the leadership. Peacock, now 50, cultivated a new mature image, enhanced by a second marriage to Margaret St George. On 18 March 1990, Peacock was interviewed by Laurie Oakes on the television program Sunday, regarding his stance on the Multifunction Polis (MFP), a proposal to build a Japan ese funded technology city in Australia.

The following day, The Australian newspaper ran a headline titled Peacock a &apos;danger in the Lodge&apos;.&apos; Although Hawke&apos;s government was in political trouble, with record high interest rates and a financial crisis in Victoria, Peacock failed to defeat Hawke at the 1990 election. Peacock resigned after the election. He became Shadow Attorney-General (1990–92) and Shadow Trade Minister (1992–93) under the new leader, Dr John Hewson. He returned to Foreign Affairs when Hewson lost the 1993 election to Keating. He retained Foreign Affairs when Hewson was displaced by Alexander Downer.
