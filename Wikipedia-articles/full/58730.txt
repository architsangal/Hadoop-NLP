It is the administrative centre of Perth and Kinross council area and the historic county town of Perthshire. According to a 2008 estimate, Perth has a population of 44,820.Perth has been known as The Fair City since the publication of the story Fair Maid of Perth by Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott in 1828. During the later medieval period the town was also called St John&apos;s Toun or Saint Johnstoun by its inhabitants in reference to the main church dedicated to St John the Baptist. The name Perth comes from a Pictish word for wood or copse. There has been a settlement at Perth since prehistoric times, on a natural mound raised slightly above the flood plain of the Tay, where the river could be crossed at low tide. The area surrounding the modern city is known to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherer s since their arrival more than 8000 years ago. Nearby Neolithic standing stones and circles also exist, dating from about 4000 BC, following the introduction of farming in the area. The presence of Scone Abbey, home of the Stone of Destiny where the King of Scots was crowned, enhanced the early importance of the town. Perth became known as a &apos;capital&apos; of Scotland, due to the frequent residence of the royal court. Royal Burgh status was soon given to the town by King William The Lion in the early 12th century. The town became one of the richest burghs in the country, doing trade with France, the Low Countries and Baltic Countries for goods such as Spanish silk and French wine. The Scottish Reformation also played a big role in the town with the sacking of the Houses of the Greyfriars and Blackfriars, after a sermon given by John Knox in St John&apos;s Kirk in 1559. The Act of settlement later brought about Jacobite uprisings. The town was occupied by Jacobite supporters on three occasions (1689, 1715 and 1745). The founding of Perth Academy in 1760 helped to bring major industries to the town, such as linen, leather, bleach and whisky. Given its location, Perth was perfectly placed to become a key transport centre with the coming of the railway s, and its first station was built in 1848. Today, Perth serves as a retail centre for the surrounding area. Following the decline of the whisky industry locally, the city&apos;s economy has now diversified to include insurance and banking. [ History ] [ History of Perth, Scotland ] The name Perth derives from a Pictish - Gaelic word for wood or copse. During much of the later medieval period it was known colloquially by its English-speaking inhabitants as &quot; St. John&apos;s Toun &quot; or &quot; Saint Johnstoun &quot; because the church at the centre of the parish was dedicated to St. John the Baptist. { Graham-Campbell Perth: The Fair City pp1 –2 } Until well into the 19th century maps only refer to the town as &quot; St. Johnstone &quot;, and &quot; Perth &quot; is very specifically the wide area known now as &quot; Perthshire &quot;. In documents it was often referred to as the &quot; town of Perth &quot;, but this appears to be in the sense of &quot; the town in the Perth area &quot;. Only since the late 19th century has the name of the town itself been fixed as Perth. Perth&apos;s Pictish name, and some archaeological evidence, indicate that there must have been a settlement here from earlier times, probably at a point where a river crossing or crossings coincided with a slightly raised natural mound on the west bank of the Tay (which at Perth flows north-south), thus giving some protection for settlement from the frequent flooding. Finds in and around Perth show that it was occupied by the Mesolithic hunter-gatherer s who arrived in the area more than 8,000 years ago. Nearby Neolithic standing stones and circles followed the introduction of farming from about 4000 BC, and a remarkably well preserved Bronze age log boat dated to around 1000 BC was found in the mudflats of the River Tay at Carpow to the east of Perth. The presence of Scone two miles (3  km) northeast, the main royal centre of the Kingdom of Alba from at least the reign of Kenneth I mac Ailpín (843–58), later the site of the major Augustinian abbey of the same name founded by Alexander I (1107–24), enhanced Perth&apos;s early importance. Perth was considered the effective &apos;capital&apos; of Scotland, due to the frequent residence of the royal court. Royal Burgh status was soon awarded to the town from King William the Lion in the early 12th century. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Perth was one of the richest trading burghs in the kingdom (along with such places as North Berwick, Aberdeen and Roxburgh ), residence of numerous craftsmen, organised into guilds (e.g. the Hammermen [metalworkers] or Glovers). Perth also carried out an extensive trade with France, The Low Countries and the Baltic Countries with luxury goods being brought back in return, such as Spanish silk and French pottery and wine. { Graham-Campbell Perth:The Fair City p8 } The royal castle (on or near the site of the present multi-storey car park adjacent to the new council offices), was destroyed by a flood of the Tay in 1209, one of many that have afflicted Perth over the centuries. { Graham-Campbell Perth:The Fair City p6 } King Edward I brought his armies to Perth in 1296 and with only a ditch for defence and little fortification, the town fell quickly. { Graham-Campbell Perth: The Fair City p14 } Stronger fortifications were quickly implemented by the English, and plans to wall the town took shape in 1304. They remained standing until Robert the Bruce &apos;s recapture of Perth in 1312. { Graham-Campbell Perth: The Fair City pp16 –17 } As part of a plan to make Perth a permanent English base within Scotland, Edward III forced six monasteries in Perthshire and Fife to pay for the construction of stone defensive walls, towers and fortified gates around the town in 1336. These defences were the strongest of any town in Scotland in the Middle Ages. King James I of Scotland was assassinated in Perth in 1437, by followers of the Earl of Atholl at Blackfriars church. { Brown, &quot; James I (1394-1437) &quot;. } Knox In the mid-16th century, John Knox instigated the Scottish Reformation at grass-roots level with a sermon against &apos;idolatry&apos; in the burgh kirk of St. John the Baptist. An inflamed mob quickly destroyed the altars in the kirk, and attacked the Houses of the Greyfriars and Blackfriars, and the Carthusian Priory. Scone Abbey was sacked shortly afterwards. The regent of infant Mary, Queen of Scots, her mother Marie de Guise, was successful in quelling the rioting but presbyterianism in Perth remained strong. In 1651, Charles II was crowned at nearby Scone, traditional site of the investiture of Kings of Scots. That same year Oliver Cromwell came to Perth following his victory in the Battle of Dunbar and established a fortified citadel on the South Inch, one of five occupation forts built to control Scotland. { http://www.perthcity.co.uk/index.asp?pg=61 } The restoration of Charles II was not without incident, and with the Act of Settlement in 1701, came the Jacobite uprisings. The town was occupied by Jacobite soldiers in 1689, 1715 and 1745. The Old Academy in Rose Terrace In 1760, Perth Academy was founded, and major industry came to the town, now with a population of 15,000. Linen, leather, bleach ed products and whisky were its major exports. Given its location, Perth was perfectly placed to become a key transport centre with the coming of the railway s. The first railway station in Perth was built in 1848. Horse-drawn carriages became popular in the 1890s; they were quickly replaced by electric tram s of Perth Corporation Tramways. Despite being a garrison town and undergoing major social and industrial developments during the First World War, Perth remained relatively unchanged. In 1829, with the settlement of the Swan River Colony, in Western Australia, Sir George Murray wanted it to be named Perth after the place where he was born. Today, Perth serves as a retail centre for the surrounding area. This includes a main shopping centre along with a pedestrianised high street and many independent and specialist shops.

[ City status ] Signage in Perth using the term &apos;city&apos; prior to the reinstatement of city status. The classic definition of Perth has been as a city, and traditional documentation confirms that this has been true since time immemorial.

It was therefore considered to be a &quot; former city &quot;, like Brechin and Elgin. Despite this, road-signs around the borders used the term &quot; The City of Perth &quot;, and directional signs within indicated &quot; City Centre &quot;.

Many top teams compete in this arena and many major events are held here each year. Curling is available from September to April annually. There is an indoor bowling hall, hosting major competitions. Historically Perth had a successful ice hockey team, Perth Panthers, who played at the old ice rink on Dunkeld Road. The rink at Dewars is the wrong shape for ice hockey, so when the team reformed in 2000 for two seasons they played their home games at Dundee Ice Arena. Perth is also home to two main parks, namely the North Inch and South Inch. The Inches were given to the city in 1377 by King Robert III. The North Inch is located directly to the north of the town centre. It is bordered to the south by Charlotte Street and Atholl Street and to the southwest by Rose Terrace. Its western perimeter consists of part of the exercise path that circumnavigates the entire park. The River Tay bounds it to the east. A little farther to the north is the Inch&apos;s eponymous golf course { North Inch Golf Course } Situated half a mile south of the North Inch, directly across the town centre, is the South Inch. The Inches are linked by Tay Street, which runs along the western banks of the Tay. The South Inch is bordered to the north by Marshall Place and Kings Place; to the east by Shore Road; to the south by South Inch View; and to the west by St Leonards Bridge. The Edinburgh Road passes through its eastern third. The South Inch offers various activities, including bowling, an adventure playground, a skate park, and, in the summer, a bouncy castle. The Perth Show takes place annually on the section of the Inch between the Edinburgh Road and Shore Road. [ Education ] There are many primary schools in Perth, while secondary education includes Perth Academy, Perth High School, Perth Grammar School and St. John&apos;s Academy. Further and higher education – including a range of degrees – is available through Perth College UHI, one of the largest partners in the University of the Highlands and Islands. It runs a network of learning centres across the area, in Blairgowrie, Crieff, Kinross and Pathways in Perth. It also owns AST (Air Service Training) which delivers a range of aircraft engineering courses. It is part of Scotland&apos;s newest university [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-12323053 Scotland&apos;s newest university created BBC news site 2 February 2011 10 August 2011 ], the University of the Highlands and Islands and brings economic and social benefits [ http://www.pkc.gov.uk/Council%2Band%2Bgovernment/Council%2Binformation%2Bperformance%2Band%2Bstatistics/Media%2Barea/Council%2Breleases/February%2B2011/Council%2Bleader%2Bwelcomes%2Buniversity%2Bfor%2BPerth%2Band%2BKinross.htm Council leader welcomes economic and social benefits of university in Perth Perth &amp; Kinross Council website 2 February 2011 10 August 2011 ] to the area. [ Transport ] Friarton Bridge on the southern outskirts of Perth Perth remains a key transport hub for journeys by road and rail throughout Scotland. The M90 motorway runs south from the city to Edinburgh; the A9 road connects it to Stirling and Glasgow in the south west and Inverness in the north. Other major roads serving the city include the A85 to Crieff and Crianlarich (and ultimately Oban ), the A93 to Blairgowrie and Braemar, the A94 to Coupar Angus and Forfar and the A90 to Dundee and Aberdeen. { Graham-Campbell Perth: The Fair City 1994, p. 139. } The city itself was bypass ed to the south and east by the M90 in the 1970s and to the west by the A9 in the 1980s. The M90, A9 and A93 all meet at Broxden Junction, one of the busiest and most important road junction s in Scotland. Uniquely, all of Scotland&apos;s other six cities are signposted from here: Glasgow and Stirling via the A9 southbound, Dundee and Aberdeen via the A90, Edinburgh via the M90, and Inverness via the A9 northbound. The final part of the M90 included the construction of the Friarton Bridge in 1978 to facilitate travel to Dundee and Aberdeen to the east of the city, finally removing inter-city traffic from the centre. The bridge is the most northerly piece of the motorway network in the United Kingdom. Perth railway station has regular services to Fife, Edinburgh Waverley via the Forth Bridge, east to Dundee and Aberdeen, and south to Glasgow Queen Street. There are two direct trains per day to London, one operated by East Coast (train operating company) to King&apos;s Cross (from Inverness), while the Caledonian Sleeper runs overnight to Euston. Local buses are run by Stagecoach Group; and Perth is also the home of the bus group. Inter-city bus travel is made from Leonard Street bus station and connects to most major destinations in Scotland. The budget Megabus service is centred on Broxden Junction (2.2 miles/3.5  km outside the city centre) and runs direct buses to Scotland&apos;s largest cities plus Manchester and London. In addition, there is a park and ride service from the services at Broxden to the city centre. Perth has a small airport. Perth Airport is located at New Scone, 7  km north east of Perth. There are no commercial flights out of this airport, but it is used by private aircraft and for pilot training. The nearest major commercial airport is Edinburgh Airport or Aberdeen Airport, although Dundee Airport, which is 20 minutes drive from Perth, offers flights to London City Airport, Belfast, and Birmingham as well as charter, engineering and training facilities.
