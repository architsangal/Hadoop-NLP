An independent municipality, the city is not part of any province, and its population as of 2008 is over one million. { Ulan Bator Statistic Bulletin May.2008 http://statis.ub.gov.mn/index.php?option=com_docman &amp; task=doc_download &amp; gid=170 &amp; Itemid=99999999 } Located in north central Mongolia, the city lies at an elevation of about [ 1310 m ] in a valley on the Tuul River. It is the cultural, industrial, and financial heart of the country. It is the center of Mongolia&apos;s road network, and is connected by rail to both the Trans-Siberian Railway in Russia and the Chinese railway system. { Ulan Bator Official Web Portal } The city was founded in 1639 as a movable (nomadic) Buddhist monastic centre. In 1778 it settled permanently at its present location, the junction of the Tuul and Selbe rivers. Before that it changed location twenty-eight times, with each location being chosen ceremonially. In the twentieth century, Ulan Bator grew into a major manufacturing centre. [ Names ] [ Names of Asian cities in different languages#U ] { classical Mongolian script } Ulan Bator has been given numerous names in its history. From 1639 to 1706, it was known as Urga ( [ Өргөө ], Örgöö, &quot; Residence &quot; ), and from 1706 to 1911 as Kuren (Хүрээ, Xüree, &quot; Camp &quot; ), Da-Kuren (Даа Хүрээ, Daa Xüree, from [ 大 ], dà, &quot; great &quot;, translation of [ Их Хүрээ ], Ix Xüree, &quot; Great Camp &quot; ), or Kulun ( [ 庫倫 ], transcription of Xüree). Upon independence in 1911, with both the secular government and the Bogd Khan &apos;s palace present, the city&apos;s name changed to Niĭslel Xüree (Нийслэл Хүрээ, &quot; Capital Camp &quot; ). It is called Bogdiin Khuree (Богдийн Хүрээ, Bogdiĭn Xüree, &quot; Saint&apos;s Camp &quot; ) in the folk song &quot; Praise of Bogdiin Khuree &quot;. The Chinese name Kulun was probably translated indirectly by borrowing from Manchu&apos;s Kuren (also means camp) which in turn came from the Mongolian name. When the city became the capital of the new Mongolian People&apos;s Republic in 1924, its name was changed to Ulan Bator (Улаанбаатар, Ulaanbaatar, classical Mongolian [ Ulaγanbaγatur ], literally &quot; Red Hero &quot; ) in honor of Mongolia&apos;s national hero Damdin Sükhbaatar, whose warriors, shoulder-to-shoulder with the Soviet Red Army, liberated Mongolia from Roman Ungern von Sternberg &apos;s troops and Chinese occupation. His statue still adorns Ulan Bator&apos;s central square. In Europe and North America, Ulan Bator generally continued to be known as Urga or sometimes Kuren (or Kulun) till 1924, and Ulan Bator afterwards (a spelling derived from [ Улан-Батор ], Ulan-Bator). The Russian spelling is different from the Mongolian because it was defined phonetically, and the Cyrillic script was only introduced in Mongolia seventeen years later. By Mongols, the city was nicknamed Aziĭn Cagaan Dagina (Азийн Цагаан Дагина, &quot; White Fairy [ Dakini ] of Asia &quot; ) in the late 20th century. In Mongolian it is now sometimes sarcastically called Utaanbaatar (Утаанбаатар, &quot; Smog Hero &quot; ) due to the heavy layer of smog in winter. [ History ] [ Pre-1778 settlements ] Human habitation at the site of Ulan Bator dates from the Lower Paleolithic. Alexey Okladnikov &apos;s archeological work in 1949 and 1960 revealed many Paleolithic sites on Mt. Bogd Khan Uul, Buyant-Ukhaa and Mt. Songinokhairkhan. In 1962 various Paleolithic tools were discovered at Mt. Songinokhairkhan as well as Buyant-Ukhaa (23 stone tools) that scholars date from 300.000 years ago to 40.000-12.000 years ago. Okladnikov also revealed an Upper Paleolithic (40.000-12.000 years ago) site on the south-east base of the Zaisan Hill north of Mt. Bogd Khan Uul. Byambyn Rinchen mentions it as an inspiration for his prehistoric novel Zaan Zaluudai. The lower strata of this bistratified settlement located at the present-day Zaisan Memorial revealed tools and materials fashioned according to the Levallois technique. These Upper Paleolithic people hunted mammoth and wooly rhinoceros, the bones of which are found abundantly around Ulan Bator. Red ochre rock paintings from the Bronze Age (3000 years ago) are to be found at Ikh Tenger Gorge on the north side of Mt. Bogd Khan Uul facing the city. The paintings show human figures, horses, eagles and abstract designs like horizontal lines and large squares with over a hundred dots within them. The same style of painting from the same era is found very close to the west of the city at Gachuurt, as well as in Khovsgol Aimag and southern Siberia, indicating a common South Siberian nomadic pastoral culture. Mt. Bogd Khan Uul was probably an important religious cult location for these people. To the north of Ulan Bator there are the vast Noin-Ula Xiongnu royal tombs which are over 2000 years old. A Xiongnu tomb has been found in Chingeltei district. The Xiongnu tombs of Belkh Gorge near Dambadarjaalin monastery are under city protection. Located on the banks of the sacred Tuul River ( &quot; Khatun Tuul &quot; or Queen Tuul in legend), the area of Ulan Bator was well within the sphere of nomadic empires such as the Xiongnu (209BC-93AD), Xianbei (93AD-4th century), Rouran (402-555), Gokturk (555-745), Uighur (745-840), Khitan (907-1125) and Mongol Empire (1206–1368).At Nalaikh District there is the important Stele of Tonyukuk (c. 722 AD) with an Old Turkic inscription in the Orkhon alphabet. A balbal or ancient human statue was chosen as the ceremonial foundation site (Shav) of the city when it settled in 1778 at its current location. Now a modern stone turtle sits atop the spot of the ancient balbal near Sukhbaatar Square in the city center. Wang Khan Toghrul of the Kerait, a Nestorian Christian monarch who was identified as the legendary Prester John by Marco Polo, is said to have had his palace here (the Black Forest of the Tuul River) and forbade hunting in the holy mountain Bogd Uul. The ruins of his palace (15x27 metres with a gate facing south) was found in Songinokhairkhan District in 1949 and excavated by D.Navaan in 2006. This brick palace influenced by Chinese architecture, later also called the Third Palace of Genghis Khan or Yesui Khatun &apos;s palace, is where Genghis Khan stayed with Yesui Khatun before attacking the Tangut. Japanese and Koreans made special programs about this palace where many important events of Genghis Khan&apos;s life took place. In 1984 a rich 13th century tomb of a 50-60 year old, 175  cm tall warrior with an ornate golden belt was excavated at Dadart Uul of Mt.Songinokhairkhan. A simple 13th century rock painting of a Mongolian woman with distinct Mongolian headdress can be seen on the north side of Mt Bogd Khan Uul. Abtai Sain Khan is said to have worshipped the mountain in the 16th century as well. The Manchu envoy Toulischen wrote an account of his travels through this region in 1712, describing how his party rested and fished ten to twenty salmon and pike in the river &quot; Tu-la &quot; while one Ko-tcha-eur-too killed a deer with a gun in the &quot; Han-shan &quot; (i.e., Khan Uul). He also describes the &quot; rich and luxuriant &quot; nature around the &quot; Sung-kee-na &quot; mountains (i.e., Mount Songino Khairkhan). { Staunton, Sir George Thomas Narrative of the Chinese embassy to the Tourgouth Tartars 1821, London, p. 30 } [ Mobile monastery ] Founded in 1639 as a yurt monastery, Ulan Bator, then Örgöö (palace- yurt ), was first located at the lake Shireet Tsagaan nuur in what is now Övörkhangai, around 250  km from the present site of Ulan Bator, and was mainly intended to be the seat of the first Jebtsundamba Khutughtu, Zanabazar. As a mobile monastery-town, it was often moved to various places along the Selenge, Orkhon and Tuul rivers, as supply and other needs would demand. During the Dzungar wars of the late 17th century, it was even moved to Inner Mongolia. { This Shireet tsagaan nuur is located in Övörkhangai&apos;s Bürd sum. P. Enkhbat, O. Pürev, Улаанбаатар, Ulaanbaatar 2001, p. 9f } As the city grew, it moved less and less. { Brief history of Ulaanbaatar } In 1778, the city settled for good at its current location, near the confluence of the Selbe and Tuul rivers and beneath Bogd Khan Uul, back then also on the caravan route from Beijing to Kyakhta. { Kohn, Michael } { Lonely Planet Mongolia 4th edition, 2005 ISBN 1-74059-359-6, p. 52 } Based on Yundendorji&apos;s petition the Qianlong emperor had officially recognized an annual ceremony on Mt. Bogd Khan Uul in 1778 and provided the annual imperial donations. The city became the seat not only of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtus, but also of two Qing amban s, and a Chinese trade town ( [ 買賣城 Măimàichéng ] ) grew &quot; four trees &quot; or 4.24 kilometers east of the city center. A pair of highly ornate 11 metre tall inscribed columns remaining from the Guanyin Temple in the former Maimaicheng district is now under national protection. Since 1778 Urga may have had around 10,000 monks. They were regulated by a monastic rule called the Internal Rule of the Grand Monastery or Yeke Kuriyen-u Doto&apos;adu Durem (for example, in 1797 or the second year of Jiaqing a decree of the 4th Jebtsundamba forbade &quot; singing, playing with archery, myagman, chess, usury and smoking &quot; ). Urga was visited by many foreign envoys and travelers, including Egor Fedorovich Timkovskii (1820), N.M. Przhevalsky, Pyotr Kozlov, M. De Bourbolon (1860) and A.M.Pozdneev. The Russian embassy of 130 persons which arrived in Urga in January 1806 included Count Yury Golovkin, Count Jan Potocki, Julius Klaproth and Andrey Yefimovich Martynov. { Timkowski, George Travels of the Russian mision through Mongolia to China and residence in Peking in the years 1820-1821 Vol.1, 1827 London, p. 128 } In 1863 the Russian Consulate of Urga was opened in a newly built two-storey building. A small onion-domed Chapel of the Holy Trinity was opened the same year. [ Revolutions of 1911 and 1921 and Communist era ] Outdoor market near Gandan hill in 1972. State Department Store in the background By the early 20th century, Ikh Khüree had a population of 25,000, of whom some 10,000 were Buddhist monks or monastery workers. { Palmer, James The Bloody White Baron 2008, Faber and Faber Limited Press, ISBN 978-0-571-23023-5, p. 45 } In 1911, with the Qing Dynasty in China headed for total collapse, Mongolian leaders in Ikh Khüree for Naadam met in secret and resolved to end more than 200 years of Manchu control of their country. On December 29, 1911 the 8th Jeptsundamba Khutughtu was declared ruler of an independent Mongolia and assumed the title Bogd Khan. Khüree as the seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu was the logical choice for the capital of the new state. However, in the tripartite Kyakhta agreement of 1915 (between Russia, China, Mongolia), Mongolia&apos;s status was changed to mere autonomy. In 1919, Mongolian nobles, over the opposition of the Bogd Khan, agreed with the Chinese resident Chen Yi on a settlement of the &quot; Mongolian question &quot; along Qing-era lines, but before this settlement could be put into effect, Khüree was occupied by the troops of Chinese warlord Xu Shuzheng, who forced the Mongolian nobles and clergy to renounce autonomy completely. In 1921 the city changed hands twice. First, in February 1921, a mixed Russian/Mongolian force led by White Russian warlord Baron Ungern von Sternberg captured the city, freeing the Bogd Khan from Chinese imprisonment and killing most of the Chinese garrison. Baron Ungern&apos;s capture of Urga was followed by a spree of looting and murder (not much better than what the Chinese had engaged in before they lost the city) and the massacre of Urga&apos;s small Jewish community. { Palmer, pp. 131-159 } On February 22, 1921 the Bogd Khan was once again crowned Khan of Mongolia in Urga. { Palmer, 161-163 } However, at the same time Baron Ungern was taking control of Urga, a Soviet-supported Communist Mongolian force led by Damdin Sükhbaatar was forming up in Russia, and in March they crossed the border. { Palmer 178-9 } Ungern and his men rode out in May to meet them but suffered a disastrous defeat in June. { Palmer 205-7 } In July the Communist Russo-Mongolian army became the second conquering force in six months to enter Urga. { Palmer 208-9 } On October 29, 1924 the town was renamed to Ulan Bator ( &quot; red hero &quot; ) as reference to Sükhbaatar, who had died the year before. Zaisan Memorial that honors Soviet soldiers killed in World War II. In the socialist period, and especially following the Second World War, most of the old yurt quarter s were replaced by Soviet-style blocks of flats, often financed by the Soviet Union. Urban planning began in the 1950s, and most of the city today is the result of construction from 1960 to 1985. { Montsame News Agency. Mongolia. 2006, ISBN 99929-0-627-8, p. 33-34 } The Transmongolian Railway, connecting Ulan Bator with Moscow and Beijing, was completed in 1956, and cinemas, theatres, museums etc. were erected. On the other hand, many of the temples and monasteries of pre-socialist Khüree were destroyed following the anti-religious purges of the late 1930s. [ Democratic protests of 1989-1990 ] The Central Tower. One of many skyscrapers in the downtown city. Ulan Bator was the site of demonstrations that led to Mongolia&apos;s transition to democracy and market economy in 1990. On December 10, 1989, protesters outside the Youth Culture Centre called for Mongolia to implement perestroika and glasnost in their full sense. Dissident leaders demanded free elections and economic reform. On January 14, 1990 the protesters, having grown from two hundred to over a thousand, met at the Lenin Museum in Ulan Bator. A demonstration in Sukhbaatar Square on Jan. 21 followed. Afterwards, weekend demonstrations in January and February were held accompanied by the forming of Mongolia&apos;s first opposition parties. On March 7, ten dissidents assembled in Sukhbaatar Square and went on a hunger strike. Thousands of supporters joined them. More came on March 8, and the crowd grew more unruly; seventy people were injured and one killed. On March 9 the communist Mongolian People&apos;s Revolutionary Party government resigned. The provisional government announced Mongolia&apos;s first free elections, which were held in July. The MPRP won the election and resumed power. { Rossabi, Morris Modern Mongolia: From Khans to Commissars to Capitalists 2005, University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-24419-2. pp. 1-28 } Since Mongolia&apos;s transition to a market economy in 1990, the city has experienced further growth - especially in the yurt quarters, as construction of new blocks of flats had basically broken down in the 1990s. [ July 2010 ] The population has more than doubled to over one million inhabitants, about 50% of Mongolia&apos;s entire population. [ July 2010 ] This causes a number of social, environmental, and transportation problems. In recent years, construction of new buildings has gained new momentum, especially in the city center, and apartment prices have skyrocketed. [ 2008 protests ] Damage to MPRP headquarters after 2008 riots In 2008, Ulan Bator was the scene of riots after the Mongolian Democratic, Civic Will Party and Republican parties disputed the Mongolian People&apos;s Revolutionary Party &apos;s victory in the parliamentary elections. Approximately 30,000 people took part in a public meeting led by the opposition parties. After the meeting was over some protestors left the central square and moved on to the nearby headquarters of the Mongolian People&apos;s Revolutionary Party, attacking and burning the building. A police station was also attacked.

Ulan Bator is noted for its extreme isolation. Due to its high elevation, relatively high latitude location hundreds of kilometres from any coast, and the effects of the Siberian anticyclone, Ulan Bator is the coldest national capital in the world, { Montsame News Agency.

The city features brief, warm summers and long, bitterly cold and dry winters. Most of the annual precipitation of [ 216 mm 2 ] falls from June to September. It has an average annual temperature of [ -2.4 °C 1 ]. The city lies in the zone of discontinuous permafrost, which means that building is difficult in sheltered aspects that preclude thawing in the summer, but easier on more exposed ones where soils fully thaw.

Each district is subdivided into Khoroo s, of which there are 121. The capital is governed by a city council (the Citizen&apos;s Representatives Hural) with forty members, elected every four years. The city council appoints the mayor. When his predecessor became prime minister in January 2006, former city manager Gombosuren Monkhbayar was elected mayor. { &apos;&apos;Writethru: Ulan Bator Mayor Enkhbold elected Mongolia&apos;s new PM&apos;&apos;, Xinhua news agency, Beijing, 25 January 2006.

The city consists of a central district built in Soviet 1940s and 1950s-style architecture, surrounded by and mingled with residential concrete towerblocks and large yurt quarters. In recent years, many of the towerblock&apos;s ground floors have been modified and upgraded to small shops, and many new buildings have been erected, some of them illegally (some private companies erect buildings without the legal licenses or in forbidden places). [ July 2008 ] [ Sights ] Sukhbaatar Square Ulan Bator has not seen any war-related destruction except the February 1921 Battle of Urga in which Baron Ungern von Sternberg defeated the 10,000 strong Chinese garrison (who had themselves occupied Urga without a battle). During the Battle of Urga it was mainly the outskirts of the city that suffered damage on the large part due to fires. It was instead Prime Minister Choibalsan &apos;s harsh policies in 1937 that led to the destruction of entire sections of the city. The Zuun khuree central palace-temple complex, the nobles&apos; residences, many ger districts as well as the main markets were completely destroyed to make way for more modern buildings. Therefore few buildings survive from before 1937. Pre-1937 buildings that survive include: Dambadarjaalin monastery in Sukhbaatar District (1765), Dashchoilin monastery&apos;s large yurt chapels (built in 1778), Gandan monastery&apos;s golden-roofed Gandantegchinlen temple also called the Tsogchin dugan (1838), Vajradhara temple (1841), Zuu temple (1869), Didan Laviran temple (19th century), the restored Russian Consulate building (1863), Erdem Itgemjit temple (1893) at the Bogd Khan&apos;s Winter Palace, rest of the buildings at the same Palace (1893–1906), the Museum of Ulaanbaatar&apos;s History which was formerly the private residence of the rich Buryat merchant Tsogt Badamjav (1904), Zanabazar&apos;s Art Museum building which was formerly called the Ondor Khorshoo (1905), the two-storey brick headquarters of the mining company &quot; Mongolore &quot; (1905), the tall Megjid Janraisig temple (1913–1914), the residence of Chin Wang Khanddorj, a prominent noble and politician in the early years of Mongolia&apos;s independence (1913), the first telephone building where Russian Orthodox choir singers stayed (1914), Marshal Zhukov Museum etc. The building of the Teacher&apos;s College was originally the government headquarters and dates from 1930.

The new market economy of the country and its very cold winter seasons have led to the formation of ger districts outside the urban center, where 60% of the population resides. The resulting air pollution problem is characterized by very high concentrations of airborne particles, particulate matter (PM), and by less severe sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide levels. Measurements carried out in Ulan Bator have shown that PM is by far the most serious component of the air pollution problem. During the winter months, urban air obscures vision and negatively impacts human health. The air pollution also affects the visibility in the city to such an extent that airplanes on some occasions are prevented from landing at the local airport. In winter, some parts of Ulaanbaatar can reach daily average concentrations of a particular type of PM known as PM10—particles with a diameter of 10 microns or smaller—that are 70 to 85 times the maximum daily exposure recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). [ Hasenkopf Christa Clearing the Air World Policy Journal Spring 2012 http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/spring2012/clearing-air 31 May 2012 ] About 40% of the population in Ulan Bator live in apartments, with about 80% of them supplied with central heating systems from three combined heat and power plants (CHP). The power plants consumed almost 3.4 million tons of coal in 2007; however, the pollution control technology is unable to accommodate this level of contaminant production. In Ulan Bator, the annual seasonal average particulate matter concentrations (PM10) have been recorded as high as 279, though the recommended maximum PM10 level is 20, as set forth by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus, the PM10 level in Ulan Bator is nearly 13 times higher than the recommended maximum level. This concentration is also greater than many cities of northern China, long known for their high levels of air pollution, in which concentrations were above 200 up until a few years ago when active measure were taken to reduce levels of harmful particulate matter.
