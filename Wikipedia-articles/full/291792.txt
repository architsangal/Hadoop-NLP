{ Lai_da_Marmorera (1,680 meters above sea level) } Altitude diving is scuba diving where the surface is 300 meters (1,000 feet) or more above sea level (for example, a mountain lake). [ Encyclopedia of Recreational Diving, 3rd edition Brylske A. 2006 PADI United States 1-878663-01-1 ] [ M. Murphey Altitude Diving Advanced Diving: Technology and Techniques NAUI 1991 150–56 Montclair, CA ] The U.S. Navy tables recommend that no alteration be made for dives at altitudes lower than 91 meters (300  feet) and dives between 91 meters and 300 meters correction is required for dives over 44 meters sea water (145 feet sea water) (actual depth). [ US Navy Diving Manual, 6th revision 2006 US Naval Sea Systems Command United States http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage%3D00c3%26amp%3BpageID%3D3.9 2008-04-24 ] Altitude diving is significant in recreational diving because the depths and durations used for dives at altitude are different from those used for the same dive profile at sea level. [ Morris R, Berthold R, and Cabrol N Diving at Extreme Altitude: Dive Planning and Execution During the 2006 High Lakes Science Expedition In: NW Pollock and JM Godfrey (Eds.) the Diving for Science…2007 Proceedings of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences Twenty–sixth annual Scientific Diving Symposium 2007 0-9800423-1-3 http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7003 2008-06-14 American Academy of Underwater Sciences Dauphin Island, Ala. ] [ Measurement of depth at altitude ] Special consideration must be given to measurement of depth given the effect of pressure on gauges.The use of bourdon tube, diaphragm, and digital depth gauges may require adjustment for use at altitude. Capillary gauges have been shown to be a conservative method for measurement of compensated depth at altitude. [ Mackay RS Automatic compensation by capillary gauge for altitude decompression Undersea Biomed Res 3 4 399–402 1976 0093-5387 2068005 10897866 http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2440 2008-04-24 ] Modern dive computer s detect changes in altitude and automatically adjust their calculation of a safe decompression regime for a dive at that altitude. If an altitude-aware computer is not used, altitude decompression tables must be used. [ Decompression when diving at altitude ] At altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level, so surfacing at the end of an altitude dive leads to a greater reduction in pressure and an increased risk of decompression sickness. [ Bennett and Elliott&apos;s physiology and medicine of diving, 5th Rev ed. Brubakk A. O. T. S. Neuman 2003 Saunders Ltd. United States 0-7020-2571-2 800 ] The dives are also typically carried out in freshwater at altitude so it has a lower density than seawater used for calculation of decompression tables. The amount of time the diver has spent at altitude is also of concern as divers with gas loadings near those of sea level may also be at an increased risk. The US Navy recommends waiting 12 hours following arrival at altitude before performing the first dive. [ Decompression tables ] The most common of the modifications to decompression tables at altitude are the &quot; Cross Corrections &quot; which use a ratio of atmospheric pressure and sea level to that of the altitude to provide a conservative equivalent sea level depth.

The US Navy does not allow repetitive diving for surface-supplied helium-oxygen diving and a 12 hour surface interval is required. An 18 hour surface interval is required if the dive requires decompression. [ Pre and Post Dive Ascents ] In addition to making depth adjustments using the Cross Conversions, dives at altitude often require pre and post dive altitude ascents which must be taken into consideration. Several methods for performing post dive ascents are used. One is to adjust the dive times needed for an altitude ascent. [ Morris B.R. Practical Altitude Diving Procedures 1984, 2010 24–27, 50 http://www.scubalaketahoe.com/books.htm ] Another is to use surface intervals to allow for an ascent. [ Extreme altitude diving ] { Lago Licancabur, site of world&apos;s highest ever altitude dive. } Although no official records are recognized, the highest recorded altitude at which a scuba dive has been conducted was [ 19300 ft m ], by a team led by Dr Charles Brush and Dr. Johan Reinhard in 1982 in Lago Licancabur.
