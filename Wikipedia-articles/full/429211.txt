And this eternal resting place Is known as Fiddlers&apos; Green. Marching past, straight through to Hell The Infantry are seen. Accompanied by the Engineers, Artillery and Marines, For none but the shades of Cavalrymen Dismount at Fiddlers&apos; Green. Though some go curving down the trail To seek a warmer scene. No trooper ever gets to Hell Ere he&apos;s emptied his canteen. And so rides back to drink again With friends at Fiddlers&apos; Green. And so when man and horse go down Beneath a saber keen, Or in a roaring charge of fierce melee You stop a bullet clean, And the hostiles come to get your scalp, Just empty your canteen, And put your pistol to your head And go to Fiddlers&apos; Green.
