The blackness surrounding the central image does not indicate darkness, but rather a lack of perceived visual information. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited, degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment and blindness. Sufferers will experience one or more of the following symptoms: Night blindness nyctalopia; Tunnel vision (no peripheral vision); Peripheral vision (no central vision); Laticcework vision; Aversion to glare; Slow adjustment from dark to light environments and vice versa; Blurring of vision; Poor colour separation; and Extreme tiredness. The progress of RP is not consistent. Some people will exhibit symptoms from infancy, others may not notice symptoms until later in life. { Koenekoop, R.K. (2003). Novel RPGR mutations with distinct retinitis pigmentosa phenotypes in French-Canadian families. American journal of ophthalmology 136(4), pp. 678-68 } Generally, the later the onset, the more rapid is the deterioration in sight. A form of retinal dystrophy, RP is caused by abnormalities of the photoreceptor s ( rod s and cone s ) or the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the retina leading to progressive sight loss. Affected individuals may experience defective light to dark, dark to light adaptation or nyctalopia (night blindness), as the result of the degeneration of the peripheral visual field (known as tunnel vision). Sometimes, central vision is lost first causing the person to look sidelong at objects. The affect of RP is best illustrated by comparison to a television or computer screen. The pixels o light that form the image on the screen equate to the millions of light receptors on the retina of the eye. The less pixels on a screen, the less distinct will be the images it will display. Less than 10 percent of all light receptors in the eye receive color, high intensity, light used in bright light or daylight conditions. These receptors are located in the center of the circular retina. The remaining 90 percent of light receptors receive gray scale, low intensity light used for low light and night vision and are located aroud the periphery of the retina. RP destroys light receptors from the outside inward, from the center outward, or in sporadic patches with a corresponding reduction in the efficiency of the eye to detect light. This degeneration is progressive and has no known cure as at June 2012. The most challenging aspect of RP is that it is not stable. Sufferers must continually adapt to less and less sight and how that impacts their life, career and relationships. Another aspect is that RP sufferers do not look different. RP does not result in any outward effect on the eyes and so people with RP &quot; do not look blind &quot;. Furthermore, though legally blind because of reduced field of vision or acuity, they may be able to see things that hold in their line of sight long enough (if bright enough) to comprehend e.g. see large or bright objects albeit indistinctly. [ Pathology ] Mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium with black bone-spicule pigmentation is typically indicative (or pathognomonic ) of retinitis pigmentosa. Other ocular features include waxy pallor of the optic nerve head, attenuation (thinning) of the retinal vessels, cellophane maculopathy, cystic macular edema and posterior subcapsular cataract. [ Diagnosis ] The diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa relies upon documentation of progressive loss in photoreceptor cell function by electroretinography (ERG) and visual field testing. The mode of inheritance of RP is determined by family history. At least 35 different gene s or loci are known to cause &quot; nonsyndromic RP &quot; (RP that is not the result of another disease or part of a wider syndrome ). DNA testing is available on a clinical basis for: [ RLBP1 ] [ RP1 ] [ RHO ] [ RDS ] [ PRPF8 ] [ PRPF3 ] [ ABCA4 ] [ RPE65 ] (autosomal recessive, Bothnia type RP) (autosomal dominant, RP1) (autosomal dominant, RP4) (autosomal dominant, RP7) (autosomal dominant, RP13) (autosomal dominant, RP18) CRB1 (autosomal recessive, RP12) (autosomal recessive, RP19) (autosomal recessive, RP20) For all other genes (e.g. DHDDS ), molecular genetic testing is available on a research basis only. RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner. X-linked RP can be either recessive, affecting primarily only males, or dominant, affecting both males and females, although males are usually more mildly affected. Some digenic (controlled by two genes) and mitochondrial forms have also been described. Genetic counseling depends on an accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. [ Associated Conditions ] Retinitis pigmentosa is seen in a variety of diseases, so the differential of this sign alone is broad. RP combined with deafness (congenital or progressive) is called Usher syndrome. RP combined with opthalmoplegia, dysphagia, ataxia, and cardiac conduction defects is seen in the mitochondrial DNA disorder Kearns-Sayre syndrome (aka Ragged Red Fiber Myopathy) RP combined with retardation, peripheral neuropathy, acanthotic (spiked) RBCs, ataxia, steatorrhea, is absence of VLDL is seen in abetalipoproteinemia. Other conditions include neurosyphilis, toxoplasmosis ( Emedicine &quot; Retinitis Pigmentosa &quot; ) and Refsum&apos;s disease. [ Genetics ] Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most common forms of inherited retinal degeneration.

[ 268000 RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA; RP ] In 1989, a mutation of the gene for rhodopsin, a pigment that plays an essential part in the visual transduction cascade enabling vision in low-light conditions, was identified. Since then, more than 100 mutations have been found in this gene, accounting for 15% of all types of retinal degeneration. Most of those mutations are missense mutation s and inherited mostly in a dominant manner.

Studies show that mutations in this gene are responsible for approximately 25% of autosomal dominant forms of RP.

Ophthalmol. 109 1 92–101 1991 January 1987956 ] Mutations in four pre-mRNA splicing factors are known to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. These are PRPF3 (human PRPF3 is HPRPF3; also PRP3), PRPF8, PRPF31 and PAP1. These factors are ubiquitously expressed and it is still a puzzle as to why defects in a ubiquitous factor should only cause disease in the retina. Up to 150 mutations have been reported to date in the opsin gene associated with the RP since the Pro23His mutation in the intradiscal domain of the protein was first reported in 1990. These mutations are found throughout the opsin gene and are distributed along the three domains of the protein (the intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains ). One of the main biochemical causes of RP in the case of rhodopsin mutations is protein misfolding, and molecular chaperones have also been involved in RP. [ Senin II, Bosch L, Ramon E, et al.

Commun. 349 1 345–52 2006 October 16934219 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.08.048 ] It was found that the mutation of codon 23 in the rhodopsin gene, in which proline is changed to histidine, accounts for the largest fraction of rhodopsin mutations in the United States. Several other studies have reported other mutations which also correlate with the disease. These mutations include Thr58Arg, Pro347Leu, Pro347Ser, as well as deletion of Ile-255.

However, this study showed that the retinal dystrophy associated with this mutation was characteristically mild in presentation and course. Furthermore, there was greater preservation in electroretinography amplitude s than the more prevalent Pro23His mutation.

The progression of the disease can be reduced by the daily intake of 15000 IU (equivalent to 4.5  mg) of vitamin A palmitate in some patients. [ Berson EL, Rosner B, Sandberg MA, et al.

These photoreceptors developed and made the necessary neural connections to the animal&apos;s retinal nerve cells, a key step in the restoration of sight. Previously it was believed that the mature retina has no regenerative ability. This research may in the future lead to using transplants in humans to relieve blindness.
