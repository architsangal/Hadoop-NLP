The first brownstone quarry in Nutley is believed to have been in operation by the early 18th century and was the town&apos;s first major industry. Jobs at the brownstone quarry in the Avondale section of Nutley provided work for many Italian and Irish immigrants.

Henry Duncan built several mills throughout the town and established the village of Franklinville consisting of 30 homes and a few small businesses which later became the center of Nutley.
