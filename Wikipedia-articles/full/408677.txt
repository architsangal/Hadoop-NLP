It borders the state of Assam to the west, Arunachal Pradesh and part of Assam to the north, Burma to the east and Manipur to the south. The state capital is Kohima, and the largest city is Dimapur. The state of Nagaland has an area of 16,579  km 2 with a population of 1,980,602 (nineteen lakhs eighty thousand six hundred two) as per the 2011 census making it one of the smallest states of India. The state is mostly mountainous except those areas bordering Assam valley. Mount Saramati is the highest peak in Nagaland with a height of 3,840 metres and its range forms a natural barrier between Nagaland and Burma. It lies between the parallels of 98 degree and 96 degree East Longitude and 26.6 degree and 27.4 degree latitude North of the Equator. Nagaland, the 16th state of the Indian Union, was established on December 1, 1963. It is divided into eleven districts: Kohima, Phek, Mokokchung, Wokha, Zunheboto, Tuensang, Mon, Dimapur, Kiphire, Longleng and Peren. It is a largely mountainous state. Agriculture is the most important economic activity in Nagaland. Principal crops include rice, corn, millets, pulses, tobacco, oilseeds, sugarcane, potatoes and fibres. Other economy boosters are forestry, cottage industries, insurance, real estate and tourism. [ History ] [ Naga people ] The early history of the Nagas is the story of the customs and economic activities of the Naga tribes. The people were originally referred to as Naka in Burmese languages, which means &apos;people with pierced ears&apos;. [ A re-discovery and re-building of Naga cultural values Inato Yekheto Shikhu Daya Books 2007 978-81-89233-55-6 4 ]. \. The Naga tribes had socio-economic and political links with tribes in Assam and Burma (Myanmar); even today a large population of Naga inhabits Assam. There are claims of nagas residing in Manipur but these tribes are culturally and socially different from the tribes of Nagaland and Assam. They are referred to as &quot; Kaccha Nagas(Fake nagas) &quot; because of the dissimilarity with the tribes of Nagaland and naga tribes in general. Following an invasion in 1816, the area, along with Assam, came under direct rule of Burma. This period was noted for oppressive rule and turmoil in Assam and Naga Hills. When the British East India Company took control of Assam in 1826, Britain steadily expanded its domain over modern Naga Hills. By 1892, all of the Naga Hills except the Tuensang area in the northeast was governed by the British. It was politically amalgamated into Assam. Missionaries played an important part in converting Nagaland&apos;s Naga tribes to Christianity. { Tezenlo Thong, “‘Thy Kingdom Come’: The Impact of Colonization and Proselytization on Religion among the Nagas,” Journal of Asian and African Studies, no. 45, 6: 595–609 } Not much is known about the history before the Burmese invasion or before the Naga people were converted to Christianity. [ Road to statehood ] During World War I, the British recruited several hundred Nagas and sent them to France to work as aides at the front. While in Europe, the Nagas, who had always been fractured by tribal differences, began to think that they should work towards becoming unified in order to protect their common interests. On their return to their homeland in 1918, they organized, and thus began the Naga nationalist movement. { The Naga Story – Then and Now } After the independence of India in 1947, the area remained a part of the province of Assam. Nationalist activities arose amongst a section of the Nagas. The Phizo -led Naga National Council demanded a political union of their ancestral and native groups, damaged government and civil infrastructure and attacked government officials and civilians from other states of India. The Union government sent the Indian Army in 1955, to restore order. In 1957, the government began diplomatic talks with representatives of Naga tribes, and the Naga Hills district of Assam and the Tuensang frontier were united in a single political entity, Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA), [ Naga Hills Tuensang Area Act, 1957 http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/727141/ ] that became a Union territory directly administered by the Central government with a large degree of autonomy. This was not satisfactory to the tribes, however, and soon agitation and violence increased across the state—included attacks on Army and government institutions, as well as civil disobedience and non-payment of taxes. In July 1960, following discussion between the Prime Minister of India and the leaders of the Naga People Convention (NPC), a 16-point Agreement was arrived at whereby the Government of India recognized the formation of Nagaland as a full-fledged State within the Union of India. { The 16-point Agreement arrived at between the Government of India and the Naga People’s Convention, July, 1960 } Accordingly, the territory was placed under the Nagaland Transitional Provisions Regulation, 1961 [ Documents on North-East India: Nagaland Suresh K. Sharma Mittal Publications 2006 81-8324-095-X, 9788183240956 225–228 ] which provided for an Interim Body consisting of 45 members to be elected by various tribes according to the customs, traditions and usage of the respective tribes. Subsequently, Nagaland attained Statehood with the enactment of the State of Nagaland Act, 1962, { The State Of Nagaland Act, 1962 } by the Parliament. The Interim Body was dissolved on November 30, 1963 and the State of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on December 1, 1963 and Kohima was christened as the state capital. After elections in January, 1964, the first Nagaland Legislative Assembly was constituted on February 11, 1964. [ Battle of Kohima ] [ Battle of the Tennis Court ] In 1944 during World War II the Battle of Kohima was the turning point of the Japanese U Go offensive into India. For the first time in South-East Asia the Japanese lost the initiative to the Allies which they then retained until the end of the war. This hand-to-hand battle and slaughter prevented the Japanese from gaining a high base from which they might next roll across the extensive flatlands of India like a juggernaut. { Bert Sim, Mosstodloch, Aberdeenshire, Scotland: Pipe Major of the Gordon Highlanders at Kohima: his home is named &quot; Kohima. &quot; -- RJWilliams, Slingerlands, NY/USA } The battle was fought from 4 April to 22 June 1944 around the town of Kohima. It is often referred to as the &quot; Stalingrad of the East &quot;. [ Martin J. Dougherty Land Warfare Thunder Bay Press 159 ] [ Peter Dennis Robert Lyman Kohima 1944: The Battle That Saved India Osprey 2010 ] [ Geography and climate ] Nagaland is largely a mountainous state. The Naga Hills rise from the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam to about [ 2000 ft ] and rise further to the southeast, as high as [ 6000 ft ]. Mount Saramati at an elevation of [ 12552 ft ] is the state&apos;s highest peak; this is where the Naga Hills merge with the Patkai Range in Burma. Rivers such as the Doyang and Diphu to the north, the Barak river in the southwest and the Chindwin river of Burma in the southeast, dissect the entire state. 20 percent of the total land area of the state is covered with wooded forest, rich in flora and fauna. The evergreen tropical and the sub tropical forests are found in strategic pockets in the state. { Geography of Nagaland } Nagaland has a largely monsoon climate with high humidity levels. Annual rainfall averages around [ 70 - 100 in mm ], concentrated in the months of May to September. Temperatures range from [ 70 F C on ] to [ 104 F C ]. In winter, temperatures do not generally drop below [ 39 F C ], but frost is common at high elevations. The state enjoys a salubrious climate. Summer is the shortest season in the state that lasts for only a few months. The temperature during the summer season remains between [ 16 C F ] to [ 31 C F ]. Winter makes an early arrival and bitter cold and dry weather strikes certain regions of the state. The maximum average temperature recorded in the winter season is [ 24 C F ]. Strong north west winds blow across the state during the months of February and March. { Climate of Nagaland } [ Flora and Fauna ] { Blyth&apos;s Tragopan } Nagaland is rich in flora and fauna. About one-sixth of Nagaland is under the cover of tropical and sub-tropical evergreen forests—including palms, bamboo, and rattan as well as timber and mahogany forests. While some forest areas have been cleared for jhum cultivation, many scrub forests, high grass, reeds; secondary dogs, pangolins, porcupines, elephants, leopards, bears, many species of monkeys, sambar, harts, oxen, and buffaloes thrive across the state&apos;s forests. The Great Indian Hornbill is one of the most famous birds found in the state. Blyth’s Tragopan, a vulnerable species of pheasant, is also found in the state and is the State Bird of Nagaland. It is sighted in mount Japfü and Dzükou valley of Kohima district, Satoi range in Zunheboto district and Pfütsero in Phek district. Of the mere 2500 tragopans sighted in the world, Dzükou valley is the natural habitat of more than 1,000. { Nagaland struggles to save state bird- The Telegraph Calcutta Monday, July 5, 2010 } Mithun (a semi domesticated Gaur ) found only in the North Eastern states of India, is the State animal of Nagaland and has been adopted as the official seal of the Government of Nagaland. It is the ritually most valued species in the state. With a view to conserve and protect this magnificent animal in the North East, the National Research Centre on Mithun (NRCM) was established by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) in the year 1988 in the state of Nagaland. { NRCM Nagaland } { Mithun } [ Culture ] [ Music of Nagaland ] The 16 main tribes of Nagaland are Angami, Ao, Chakhesang, Chang, Khiamniungan, Konyak, Lotha, Phom, Pochury, Rengma, Sangtam, Sumi, Yimchunger, Kuki and Zeliang. The Konyaks, Angamis, Aos, Lothas, and Sumis are the largest Naga tribes; there are several smaller tribes as well (see List of Naga tribes ). Tribe and clan traditions and loyalties play an important part in the life of Nagas. Weaving is a traditional art handed down through generations in Nagaland. Each of the tribe has its own unique designs and colours, producing shawls, shoulder bags, decorative spears, table mats, wood carvings, and bamboo works. Among many tribes the design of the shawl denotes the social status of the wearer. Some of the more known shawls include Tsungkotepsu and Rongsu of the Ao tribe; Sutam, Ethasu, Longpensu of the Lothas; Supong of the Sangtams, Rongkhim and Tsungrem Khim of the Yimchungers; the Angami Lohe shawls with thick embroidered animal motifs etc. Folk songs and dances are essential ingredients of the traditional Naga culture. The oral tradition is kept alive through the media of folk tales and songs. Naga folks songs are both romantic and historical, with songs narrating entire stories of famous ancestors and incidents. There are also seasonal songs which describe various activities done in a particular agricultural season. Tribal dances of the Nagas give an insight into the inborn Naga reticence of the people. War dances and other dances belonging to distinctive Naga tribes are a major art form in Nagaland. The tribes of Nagaland celebrate their festivals with gusto and fervor. More than 60% of the population of Nagaland depends on agriculture and therefore most of their festivals revolve round agriculture. They consider their festivals sacred and so participation in these festivals is compulsory. Nagaland is known as the land of festivals as each tribe celebrates its own festival with dedication and passion. Some of the important festivals celebrated are: Tsukhenyie by the Chakhesangs in January, Mimkut by the Kukis in January, Bushu by the Kacharis in January, Sekrenyi by the Angamis in February, Aoling by the Konyaks in April, Moatsü by the Aos in May, Tuluni by the Sumis in July, Nyaknylum by the Changs in July, Mongmong by the Sangtams in September, Tokhu Emong by the Lothas in November and Yemshe by the Pochuris in October. { Naga Festivals www.festivalsofindia.in } [ Hornbill Festival of Nagaland ] [ Hornbill Festival ] { Hornbill Festival Hornbill Festival official website } { was launched by the } { Government of Nagaland in December 2000 to encourage inter-tribal interaction and to promote cultural heritage of the state. Organized by the State Tourism and Art &amp; Culture Departments, Hornbill Festival showcases a mélange of cultural displays under one roof. This festival takes place between the 1st and the 7th of December every year. } The week long Hornbill Festival is held at Naga Heritage Village, Kisama which is about 12 km from Kohima. All the tribes of Nagaland take part in this festival. The aim of the festival is to revive and protect the rich culture of Nagaland and display its extravaganza and traditions. { Hornbill Festival www.festivalsofindia.in } The Festival is named after the Hornbill, the globally respected bird and which is displayed in folklore in most of the state’s tribes. The week long festival unites one and all in Nagaland and people enjoy the colourful performances, crafts, sports, food fairs, games and ceremonies. Traditional arts which include paintings, wood carvings, and sculptures are also on display. Festival highlights include Traditional Naga Morungs Exhibition and sale of Arts and Crafts, Food Stalls, Herbal Medicine Stalls, Flower shows and sales, Cultural Medley - songs and dances, Fashion shows, Beauty Contest, Traditional Archery, Naga wrestling, Indigenous Games and Musical concerts.

The state&apos;s population is 1.988 million, out of which 90.02% are Christians. { Indian Census } The census of 2001 recorded the state&apos;s Christian population at 1,790,349, making it, with Meghalaya and Mizoram, one of the three Christian-majority states in India and the only state where Christians form 90% of the population. The state has a very high church attendance rate in both urban and rural areas. Huge churches dominate the skylines of Kohima, Dimapur, and Mokokchung. { Alichen, Nagaland } Nagaland is known as &quot; the only predominantly Baptist state in the world. &quot; { Olson, C. Gordon. What in the World Is God Doing. Global Gospel Publishers: Cedar Knolls, NJ. 2003. } Among Christians, Baptists are the predominant group, constituting more than 75% of the state&apos;s population, thus making it more Baptist (on a percentage basis) than Mississippi in the southern United States, where 55% of its population is Baptist. { American Religious Identification Survey www.gc.cuny.edu. } { Mississippi Denominational Groups, 2000 Thearda.com. Retrieved 2010-07-30. } Roman Catholics, Revivalists, and Pentecostals are the other Christian denomination numbers. Catholics are found in significant numbers in parts of Wokha district and Kohima district as also in the urban areas of Kohima and Dimapur. Hinduism and Islam practiced by the non-Naga community are minority religions in the state, at 7.7% and 1.8% of the population respectively. [ Languages ] Each tribe of Nagaland has its own unique language. Nagas speak 20 different dialects(16 tribes in Nagaland including kuki and dimasa) belonging to the Sino-Tibetan family of languages. The traditional languages do not have any script of their own. The Christian missionaries used Roman script for these languages. In 1967, the Nagaland Assembly proclaimed English as the official language of Nagaland and is the medium for education in Nagaland. Nagamese, a creole language form of Indo-Aryan Assamese and local dialects is the most widely spoken market language. Every tribe has its own mother tongue but communicates with other tribes in Nagamese. As such Nagamese is the lingua franca of the people of Nagaland. The &quot; Kaccha nagas &quot; of Manipur communicate with each other in Meitei language which is the common language of the people of Manipur. [ Demography ] The population of Nagaland is nearly two million people. The population mostly consists of Agriculturalist and around 75% of the population live in the rural areas. About one-third of this rural population can be considered to be below the poverty line. [ November 2011 ] Among the people living in urban areas one-fifth of them are below the poverty line.

He possesses largely ceremonial responsibilities apart from law and order responsibilities.The Legislative Assembly of Nagaland ( Vidhan Sabha ) is the real executive and legislative body of the state. The 60-member Vidhan Sabha — all elected members of legislature — forms the government executive and is led by the Chief minister. Unlike most states in India, Nagaland has been granted a great degree of state autonomy, as well as special powers and autonomy for Naga tribes to conduct their own affairs. Each tribe has a hierarchy of councils at the village, range, and tribal levels dealing with local disputes.

Crops include rice, corn, millets, pulses, tobacco, oilseeds, sugarcane, potatoes, and threads. However, Nagaland still depends on the import of food supplies from other states. The widespread practice of jhum, tilling, has led to soil erosion and loss of fertility, particularly in the eastern districts. Only the Angami and Chakesang tribes in the Kohima and Phek districts use terracing techniques. And most of the Aos, Lothas, and Zeliangs in Mokokchung, Wokha, and Peren districts respectively till in the many valleys of the district. Forestry is also an important source of income. Cottage industries such as weaving, woodwork, and pottery are also an important source of revenue. Tourism is important, but largely limited due to insurgency since the last five decades. Nagaland&apos;s gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $1.4 billion in current prices. [ Transportation ] The railway network in the state is minimal. Broad gauge lines run [ 7.98 mi km ], National Highway roads [ 227.0 mi km ], and state roads [ 680.1 mi km ]. There is one airport in Dimapur.
