It is the largest town and the administrative centre of Blaenau Gwent county borough. The Ebbw Vale and Brynmawr conurbation has a population of roughly 33,000. [ History ] Ebbw Vale town centre. Originally a rather insignificant spot in rural Monmouthshire with only about 120 inhabitants at the end of the 18th century, Ebbw Vale—and the whole valley—was transformed by the Industrial Revolution. [ John Davies John Davies (historian) Nigel Jenkins Nigel Jenkins Baines Menna Peredur I. Lynch The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales 2008 University of Wales Press Cardiff 978-0-7083-1953-6 ] The Ebbw Vale Iron Works, later to become the Ebbw Steel works, opened in 1778, followed by the opening of a number of coal mine s around 1790. At its height (1930s — 40s) the steel works in Ebbw Vale was the largest in Europe, attracting attention from German bombers during World War II. However the deep valley proved difficult to bomb and the plant survived. By the 1960s around 14,500 people were employed in the works in and around Ebbw Vale, but the end of the century witnessed a massive collapse to the industry. A strike in 1980 was followed by closures and redundancies which resulted in the dismantling of many of the old plants. In 2002 only 450 were employed in the old industries, and by July of that year the final works closed. Today there are no steelworks or mines left in or around the town, though Ebbw Vale is still recognised for its innovation and contribution to the development of Britain as an industrial nation. This includes the world&apos;s first steel rail, rolled at Ebbw Vale in 1857, { Coleford People – Robert Mushet } and the rails for the Stockton and Darlington Railway were also manufactured at Ebbw Vale. { Rhagor | 200 Years of Industrial Innovation at Ebbw Vale } Unemployment in Ebbw Vale is among the highest rates in the United Kingdom, largely the result of the decline of the mining and steel industries. In 2003 work began on demolishing the long-standing steelworks, and currently around one to two miles of the valley stands empty awaiting development. Ebbw Vale hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1958. The Welsh language was dominant in the area until the last quarter of the 19th century and remnants of the language (Welsh hymns and pockets of Welsh being spoken in nearby Rhymney ) persisted into the 1970s. The National Eisteddfod returned to Ebbw Vale in 2010. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/eisteddfod/2010/ National Eisteddfod 2010 BBC 4 April 2012 ] Aneurin Bevan, the &quot; father &quot; of the National Health Service, represented Ebbw Vale as a Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) in Parliament from the 1929 general election. When he died in 1960, he was succeeded as MP by Michael Foot. The seat is now called Blaenau Gwent. The Ebbw Vale conurbation today is a product of areas which grew during the Industrial Revolution in the South Wales coalfield and the South Wales Valleys as a result of the iron industry, local ironworks or have developed as a result of distinct housing areas to serve local industry with workers, they include: Ebbw Vale, Rassau, Garnlydan, Hill Top, Briery Hill, Glyncoed, Willowtown, Glanyrafon, Cwm, Newtown, Victoria, Tyllwyn, Waunlwyd and Ebbw Vale itself. In particular Beaufort and Victoria were the two original iron producing areas. Entrance to Festival Park shopping outlet [ National Garden Festival of Wales ] In 1992 the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival was the last National Garden Festival. It was sited on the south side of the recently demolished steel works. The festival ran for five months between 1 May to 4 October 1992 having attracted over 2 million visitors. The development cost around 18 million pounds. Since the festival the site has been renamed Festival Park and has slowly become dilapidated over 16 years due to lack of care and attention. { Garden Festival of Wales website } It is now the site of the Festival Park Branded Outlet, a retail outlet comprising approximately forty shops. [ Steelworks development ] The Ebbw Vale Steelworks site known as &quot; The Works &quot; is being re-developed under a £350 million regeneration project by Blaenau Gwent Council and Welsh Government. It will then have many different uses; housing, retail &amp; office, wetlands, a Learning campus and many other uses. The steelworks closed in 2002 and the land was remediated over a period of approximately five years. Outline planning consent was granted in 2007 for a mixed use development. Wales&apos; first all individual bed hospital Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan opened in 2010 and is named after the NHS&apos; founder: Aneurin Bevan. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11530257 Hospital named after Aneurin Bevan opens in Ebbw Vale 3 April 2012 12 October 2010 BBC News ] [ Welsh Future Homes ] A small development of four prototype houses have been developed on the site as a pre-cursor to the wider residential development parcels being developed. Following a competition run by the council several plots were developed in time to be demonstrated at the 2010 Eisteddfod which was held on the steelworks site. In 2010 Blaenau Gwent council and United Welsh Housing Association, built two eco-friendly prototype buildings. The Larch house and the Lime House are both extremely energy efficient houses meeting both Passivhaus and Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6 and Level 5 respectively. The buildings were open for demonstration at the 2010 Eisteddfod.

It meets Code for Sustainable Homes Level 5 and utilising construction techniques that allow Welsh softwood to be used in the fabric of the building. [ The Environmental Resource Centre ] The Environmental Resource Centre (ERC) is an educational facility run by Gwent Wildlife Trust. Designed by Cardiff University&apos;s Design Research Unit and Located on the Hotmill Plateau it was the first building to be completed as part of the redevelopment of the former steelworks site in Ebbw Vale. The centre is located on an ecologically rich site next to the Pumphouse cooling ponds, which have become a haven for wildlife since the closure of the steelworks. It was officially opened by Iolo Williams and Jane Davidson AM on 21 May 2010. [ General Offices ] The view from Ebbw Vale. The General Offices is a grade 2* Listed Building which is undergoing renovation. Built during 1913–15 it formed part of the Steelworks site. A brand new modern extension (contrasting with the original building) officially opened on 24 October 2010 and houses the The Gwent Archives. The main building is partially opened with an entrance hall and function rooms together with a 4D cinema. [ Education ] Ebbw Vale currently is host to a selection of primary school s and infant school s, two secondary school s (Glyncoed comprehensive school &amp; Ebbw Vale Comprehensive School) both covering a large catchment area. Alongside this there is also the Ebbw Vale campus of Coleg Gwent, a Further Education college teaching a range of subjects from Mechanics, Media Studies, Humanities to Hairdressing and Beauty therapy. There is also an institute which provides a range of courses for mainly adult learners. A large 13,000sqm &quot; Learning Zone &quot; building is currently under construction due to open in September 2012 with Colleg Gwent offering a very wide range of both academic and vocational courses for post 16 education. [ Sport and culture ] Sport features as one of the many reasons for pride in the Ebbw Vale area, including a top flight Welsh Premiership rugby union team, Ebbw Vale Rugby Football Club, that participated in the Celtic League and various European competitions until the restructuring of the Welsh Rugby Union that took effect from the 2003–04 season, effectively removing any professional rugby representation from the area. The Ebbw Vale rugby team is nicknamed &apos;The Steelmen&apos; named after the steelworks in the town. These days Ebbw Vale RFC still compete at a semi-professional level in the WRU Principality Premiership along with the Welsh Cup. In 2007, the club finished 2nd in the Premiership in what was one of their most successful seasons ever. In 1907 Ebbw Vale RFC switched to professional rugby league, becoming Ebbw Vale RLFC. It was the first rugby league club in Wales and the team won the Welsh League in 1909 and 1910. [ Lush Peter Farrar, Dave Tries in the Valley: A History of Rugby League in Wales 1998 24–28 London League Publications London 0952606437 ] Also in the town there is a keen interest in cricket (of which the town hosted several Glamorgan County Cricket fixtures until 1996), bowls, swimming, and a large host of football and rugby teams at varying levels. Eugene Cross Park is the home of both the town&apos;s rugby and cricket clubs. However, cricket predates rugby and Ebbw Vale&apos;s first recorded match was played against Blaina as far back as 1852. During the 19th century the influx of people from the surrounding counties looking for work in the local ironworks and coal mine s gave cricket a boost and in June 1879 &quot; a meeting was held at the Institute to form a cricket club in the town &quot;. In addition to the above the town also has a leisure centre which hosts facilities ranging from a gym, sauna, weights room, indoor 5-a-side football pitches, squash court s and a 33m long, 4m deep swimming pool with diving boards. Ebbw Vale&apos;s theatre, the Beaufort Theatre, is the largest in Blaenau Gwent. The town has been the subject of art works by notable painters including Nan Youngman [ Newport Museum and Art Gallery http://www.newport.gov.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/leaflets_and_brochures/n_060538.pdf Industrial South Wales: The Poetics of Place John R Wilson 2004 ] and L S Lowry; the latter&apos;s 1960 Ebbw Vale, on display at the Herbert Art Gallery in Coventry, numbers among the largest works he ever produced.
