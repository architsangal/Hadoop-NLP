[ 1918 7 11 y ] [ 2009 4 30 1918 7 11 y ] { Banstead, } { England, UK } { Naming } { Pluto } [ Edward Maxwell Phair 1947 2006 ] { Patrick } { Charles Fox Burney Ethel Wordsworth Madan } { Falconer Madan, grandfather } Venetia Phair, née Burney (11 July 1918 – 30 April 2009) was the first person to suggest the name Pluto for the (then) planet (now classified as a dwarf planet ) discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. At the time, she was 11 years old and lived in Oxford, England. [ Biography ] Venetia Katharine Douglas Burney was the daughter of Rev. Charles Fox Burney, Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture at Oxford, and his wife Ethel Wordsworth Burney (née Madan). Venetia was the granddaughter of Falconer Madan (1851–1935), Librarian of the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford. [ Venetia Phair http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/5280426/Venetia-Phair.html Venetia Phair, who has died aged 90, had the distinction of being the only woman in the world to have named a planet; in 1930, as a girl of 11, she suggested the name Pluto for the enigmatic celestial body that had just been discovered, and which became (albeit only temporarily) the ninth planet in our solar system. Daily Telegraph May 5, 2009 2009-05-11 ] Falconer Madan&apos;s brother, Henry Madan (1838–1901), Science Master of Eton, had in 1878 suggested the names Phobos and Deimos for the moons of Mars. { &apos;&apos;The Observatory&apos;&apos;, Vol. 53, pp. 193–201 (1930) } On 14 March 1930, Falconer Madan read the story of the new planet&apos;s discovery in The Times, and mentioned it to his granddaughter Venetia. She suggested the name Pluto  — the Roman God of the Underworld who was able to make himself invisible  — and Falconer Madan forwarded the suggestion to astronomer Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled his American colleagues at Lowell Observatory. Tombaugh liked the proposal because it started with the initials of Percival Lowell who had predicted the existence of Pluto. On 1 May 1930, the name Pluto was formally adopted for this new celestial body. Burney was educated at Downe House School in Berkshire and Newnham College, Cambridge, where she studied mathematics. After graduation she became a chartered accountant. Later she became a teacher of economics and mathematics at girls’ schools in southwest London. She was married to Edward Maxwell Phair from 1947 until his death in 2006. Her husband, a classicist, later became housemaster and head of English at Epsom College. She died on 30 April 2009, aged 90, in Banstead.

She was 90. The death was confirmed by her son, Patrick. New York Times May 10, 2009 2009-05-11 ] Only a few months before the reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, with the debate going on about the issue, she said in an interview that &quot; At my age, I&apos;ve been largely indifferent to [the debate]; though I suppose I would prefer it to remain a planet. &quot; [ The girl who named a planet BBC News P.
