Gulfstream. December 8, 2003. } It was introduced into service in 2004. As a shorter range version of the G550, it has the same exterior appearance, as well as the PlaneView cockpit, but does not have the Enhanced Vision System (EVS) as standard equipment, although it is available as an option. It has a lower fuel capacity than the G550 for a range up to [ 5800 nmi km ]. The G500 was designed for an emerging market of customers who require the reliability of the G550, but neither the range nor the level of interior customization. [ Gulfstream G550 ] G550 flight deck The G550, a variant of the Gulfstream V, initially named Gulfstream V SP, { &quot; Gulfstream G550 gets US approval &quot;. Flight International, December 17, 2002. } was released to the market in 2003. It has increased performance. Range is increased to 6,750 nautical miles (12,500  km), mostly due to reductions in aerodynamic drag. The Gulfstream 550 has the longest flight range in its class. Additionally, this aircraft has a &quot; PlaneView &quot; cockpit, { cockpit image, airliners.net } which consists of 4 Honeywell DU-1310 EFIS screens, a Gulfstream-designed cursor control system, and an Enhanced Vision System (EVS). EVS is an infrared camera that displays an image of the view in front of the camera on a head up display. The system permits the aircraft to land in lower-visibility instrument meteorological conditions than a non-EVS-equipped aircraft. This aircraft may be distinguished from the legacy Gulfstream V by a seventh passenger window on both sides of the aircraft, and by the square outflow valve on the aircraft right side as compared to the circular one on the GV. More than 182 Gulfstream G550 aircraft have been produced as of 2008. { &quot; Gulfstream Marks Entry-Into-Service Anniversaries for the G550 and the GIV-SP &quot;.
