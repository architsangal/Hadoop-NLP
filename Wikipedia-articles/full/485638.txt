G. Armstrong Whitworth and Company at High Walker and launched in March 1915. She was named in honour of the Federated Malay States in British Malaya, whose government paid for her construction. [ World War I ] In World War I she served in Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas &apos;s 5th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. She took part in the Battle of Jutland, 31 May 1916, where she was hit eight times and took major damage and heavy crew casualties. A total of 65 men died, in the battle or later, of their injuries. Among the wounded was Able Seaman Willie Vicarage, notable as one of the first men to receive facial reconstruction using plastic surgery and the first to receive radical reconstruction via the &quot; tubed pedicule &quot; technique pioneered by Sir Harold Gillies.

[ Between the wars ] In 1922 Malaya carried the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed VI, into exile on Malta. In August-September 1938 she served in the port of Haifa during the Arab Uprising.

[ World War II ] In World War II she served in the Mediterranean in 1940, escorting convoy s and operating against the Italian fleet. On one occasion her presence in a convoy was sufficiently discouraging to the German commerce raider s &apos;&apos;Scharnhorst&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Gneisenau&apos;&apos; that they withdrew rather than risk damage in an attack. { www.scharnhorst-class.dk } She shelled Genoa in February 1941 as part of Operation Grog but due to a crew error, fired a 15 &quot; armour piercing shell into the south east corner of the Cathedral nave. The fuse failed to detonate.

U-106 attacked the shadow of a merchant ship with a spread of two stern torpedoes in bad light from the port side of the convoy SL-68 about 250  miles west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Kapitänleutnant Jürgen Oesten heard hits after 2  minutes 37 seconds and 3  minutes 35 seconds. One torpedo damaged Malaya and the other the Meerkerk. Malaya was hit by the torpedo on the port side, causing considerable damage. Due to the flooding of some compartments the ship took a list of 7 degrees, but safely reached Trinidad. After temporary repairs were made, she continued to the New York Navy Yard, where she was docked for four months. On 9 July, under the command of Captain Cuthbert Coppinger, the battleship left New York on trials and steamed to Halifax, Nova Scotia to provide protection for an urgent fast convoy. On this Atlantic crossing no ships were lost and Malaya arrived on 28 July in Rosyth. Thereafter Malaya escorted convoys from the United Kingdom to Malta and Cape Town until summer 1943. [ Fate ] Malaya was placed in reserve at the end of 1943. During this time her entire secondary 6 &quot; armament was landed while her anti-aircraft armament was enhanced. She was reactivated just before the 1944 Normandy Landings to act as a reserve bombardment battleship. Malaya was finally withdrawn from all service at the end of 1944 and became an accommodation ship for a torpedo school.
