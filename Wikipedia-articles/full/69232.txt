TROPICOS Missouri Botanical Garden 2010-02-09 ] { Species } { About 250 species; see text } Sumac ( [ icon ˈ sj uː m æ k ] or [ ˈ ʃ uː m æ k ]; also spelled sumach) is any one of approximately 250 species of flowering plant s in the genus Rhus and related genera, in the family Anacardiaceae. Sumacs grow in subtropical and temperate regions throughout the world, especially in Africa and North America. { 12. Rhus Linnaeus, Flora of China } { Rhus L., USDA PLANTS } Sumacs are shrub s and small tree s that can reach a height of [ 1 - 10 m ft ]. The leaves are spirally arranged; they are usually pinnately compound, though some species have trifoliate or simple leaves. The flower s are in dense panicle s or spikes [ 5 - 30 cm in ] long, each flower very small, greenish, creamy white or red, with five petals. The fruit s form dense clusters of reddish drupe s called sumac bobs. The dried drupes of some species are ground to produce a tangy purple spice. { Sumac is also used as a tea substitute by boiling the dried leaves. Sumac - Ingredients - Taste.com.au } { Poison Sumach and Good Sumac Shrubs } Sumacs propagate both by seed ( spread by bird s and other animals through their droppings ), and by new shoot s from rhizome s, forming large clonal colonies. The word sumac traces its etymology from Old French sumac (13th century), from Medieval Latin sumach, from Arabic [ ar summāq ] ( [ ar سماق ] ), from Syriac [ syc summāq ] ( [ syc ܣܘܡܩ ] ) - meaning &quot; red. &quot; { Etymology of Sumac at Etymonline.com and also at and. Etymology of Rhus at } [ http://books.google.com/?id%3DzIOvJSJs-IkC Umberto Quattrocchi CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology IV R-Z 2000 Taylor &amp; Francis US 978-0-8493-2678-3 2306 ] [ Cultivation and uses ] Sumac spice The fruits ( drupe s ) of the genus Rhus are ground into a deep-red or purple powder used as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine to add a lemon y taste to salads or meat. In Arab cuisine, it is used as a garnish on meze dishes such as hummus and is added to salads in the Levant. In Iranian (Persian and Kurdish ) cuisine, sumac is added to rice or kebab. In Turkish cuisine, it is added to salad-servings of kebabs and lahmacun. Rhus coriaria is used in the spice mixture za&apos;atar. In North America, the Smooth Sumac ( R. glabra ) and the Staghorn Sumac ( R. typhina ) are sometimes used to make a beverage termed &quot; sumac-ade, &quot; &quot; Indian lemonade &quot; or &quot; rhus juice &quot;. This drink is made by soaking the drupes in cool water, rubbing them to extract the essence, straining the liquid through a cotton cloth and sweetening it. Native Americans also used the leaves and drupes of the Smooth and Staghorn Sumacs combined with tobacco in traditional smoking mixtures. Species including the Fragrant Sumac ( R. aromatica ), the Littleleaf Sumac ( R. microphylla ), the Skunkbush Sumac (R. trilobata), the Smooth Sumac and the Staghorn Sumac are grown for ornament, either as the wild types or as cultivar s. The leaves of certain sumacs yield tannin (mostly pyrogallol -type), a substance used in vegetable tanning. Notable sources include the leaves of R. coriaria, Chinese gall on R. chinensis, and wood and roots of R. pentaphylla. Leather tanned with sumac is flexible, light in weight, and light in color. One type of leather made with sumac tannins is morocco leather. [ January 2012 ] Sumac was used as a treatment for half a dozen different ailments in medieval medicine, primarily in Islamic countries (where sumac was more readily available than in Europe). An 11th-century shipwreck off the coast of Rhodes, excavated by archeologists in the 1970s, contained commercial quantities of sumac drupes. These could have been intended for use as medicine, or as a culinary spice, or as a dye. { Archaeology report of sumac goods in the sunken medieval ship at } Some beekeepers use dried sumac bobs as a source of fuel for their smokers. [ January 2012 ] Sumac stems also have a soft pith in the center that is useful in traditional native American pipemaking. They were commonly used as pipe stems in the northern United States. [ January 2012 ] Dried sumac wood fluoresces under long-wave ultraviolet radiation, commonly known as black light.

Bruce Hoadley 2 Taunton Press 2000 978-1-56158-358-4 Chapter 5: Other Properties of Wood 105–107 ] [ Toxicity and control ] Some species, such as Poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron, syn. Toxicodendron radicans), Poison oak (Rhus diversiloba, syn. Toxicodendron diversilobum ) and Poison sumac (Rhus vernix, syn. Toxicodendron vernix), have the allergen urushiol and can cause severe allergic reactions. Poison sumac may be identified by its white drupe s. Mowing of sumac is not a good control measure, since the wood is springy, resulting in jagged, sharp pointed stumps when mowed. The plant will quickly recover with new growth after mowing.

Schacht Management of Smooth Sumac on Grasslands University of Nebraska-Lincoln 2000 ] [ December 2011 ] Goats have long been considered an efficient and quick removal method as they eat the bark, which helps prevent new shoots. [ Taxonomy ] { Staghorn Sumac in Coudersport, PA } { Staghorn Sumac } &apos;&apos;Rhus lancea&apos;&apos; fruit { Staghorn Sumac bob, Hamilton, Ontario } Winged Sumac leaves and flowers { Rhus malloryi &apos;&apos; fossil } At times Rhus has held over 250 species. Recent molecular phylogeny research suggests breaking Rhus sensu lato into Actinocheita, Baronia, Cotinus, Malosma, Searsia, Toxicodendron, and Rhus sensu stricto. If this is done, about 35 species would remain in Rhus. However, the data are not yet clear enough to settle the proper placement of all species into these genera.
