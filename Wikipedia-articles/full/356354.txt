[ BirdLife International 2006 17957 Polysticta stelleri 11 May 2006 ] { Database entry includes justification for why this species is vulnerable } { down } { stellersdrake2.jpg } { A drake } { Animal ia } { Chordata } { Aves } { Anseriformes } { Anatidae } { Merginae } { Polysticta } { Eyton, 1836 } { P. stelleri } { Polysticta stelleri } { ( } { Pallas, 1769) } The Steller&apos;s Eider (Polysticta stelleri) is a smallish sea duck that breeds along the Arctic coasts of eastern Siberia and Alaska. The lined nest is built on tundra close to the sea, and 6-10 eggs are laid. It winters somewhat farther south in the Bering Sea, northern Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea. It can form large flocks, up to 200,000 bird s on suitable coastal waters. It is scarce south of its wintering range. This species dives for crustacean s and mollusc s, with mussel s being a favoured food. This species is the smallest eider at 45  cm long. { The Birds of North America Online. Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Ithaca } The male is unmistakable with its black upperparts and neck collar, white head and yellowish underparts. The drake&apos;s call is a deep crooning, although it is relatively quiet compared to the Somateria eiders. The female is a dark brown bird, smaller with a more typically duck -shaped head and body than other eider species. She also has a repertoire of grunts and whistles. This bird is named after the German naturalist Georg Steller. The Steller&apos;s Eider is thought to have hybridised with the Common Eider on at least two occasions in the wild. A drake showing characters of both species was present at Cuxhaven, Niedersachen, Germany on 17 November 1993. { Anon (1995) Hybrid coincidence } { Birding World 8(5):200 } Another drake was seen in Vadso harbour, Varanger, Norway on 7 April 1995; a photograph of this bird was published accompanying Forsman (1995). { Forsman, Dick (1995) A presumed hybrid Steller&apos;s Eider x Common Eider in Norway &apos;&apos; } { Birding World &apos; 8(4):138 } [ Conservation ] The Steller&apos;s Eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) applies. There is an active recovery plan in Alaska.
