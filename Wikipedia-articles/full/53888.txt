{ A New Hope &apos;&apos; } The Death Star is a fiction al moon-sized space station and superweapon appearing in the Star Wars movies and expanded universe. It is capable of destroying a planet with a single destructive energy beam. [ Origin and design ] Although particular details, such as the superlaser&apos;s location, shifted between different concept models during production of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station was consistent in all of them. [ http://www.starwars.com/databank/location/deathstar/?id%3Dbts Death Star (Behind the Scenes) Lucasfilm Star Wars Databank 2007-09-08 ] The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials. [ The Sounds of Star Wars J. W.

Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte painting s. [ Depiction ] { Return of the Jedi &apos;&apos; } [ Films ] The original Death Star first appears in its completed form in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Commanded by Grand Moff Tarkin ( Peter Cushing ), it is the Galactic Empire &apos;s &quot; ultimate weapon &quot;, a space station capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its superlaser. The film opens with Leia Organa ( Carrie Fisher ) transporting the station&apos;s schematics to the Rebel Alliance to aid them in destroying the Death Star. Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia&apos;s home world of Alderaan in an attempt to pressure her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel base; she gives them a (false) location, but Tarkin has the planet destroyed anyway. Later, Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) boards the station with his friends and rescues her; in the film&apos;s climactic battle scene, he uses his power in the Force to help him destroy the station. In Return of the Jedi, set four years later, the Empire is building a new Death Star; it is half-finished throughout the film. Emperor Palpatine ( Ian McDiarmid ) and Darth Vader ( David Prowse / James Earl Jones ) send the Rebels false information that the station&apos;s weapons systems are not operational in order to lure them into a trap, and bring Skywalker on board to turn him to the dark side of the Force. In the film&apos;s climax, Vader throws Palpatine down the station&apos;s reactor core, killing him, and is mortally wounded in the process. Skywalker escapes with Vader&apos;s body moments before the Rebels destroy the station. The first Death Star also appears in the &apos;&apos;Star Wars&apos;&apos; prequel trilogy : its schematics are visible in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and the end of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith shows the Death Star early in its construction. The Death Star explosions featured in the special edition of A New Hope and in Return of the Jedi are rendered with a Praxis effect, wherein a flat ring of matter erupts from the explosion. [ Expanded Universe ] { Palpatine ( } { Ian McDiarmid ), left, and } { Darth Vader watch the construction of the first Death Star in &apos;&apos; } { Revenge of the Sith &apos;&apos;. } Both Death Stars appear throughout the &apos;&apos;Star Wars&apos;&apos; Expanded Universe. The first Death Star&apos;s construction is the subject of Michael Reaves and Steve Perry &apos;s novel Death Star. In LucasArts &apos; Star Wars: Battlefront II, the player participates in a mission to secure crystals used in the Death Star&apos;s superlaser. The first Death Star under construction acts as the final stage in the video game, The Force Unleashed. Kevin J. Anderson &apos;s Jedi Academy trilogy introduces the Maw Cluster of black hole s that protect a laboratory where the Death Star prototype was built (consisting of the super structure, power core, and Super Laser.) National Public Radio &apos;s &apos;&apos;A New Hope&apos;&apos; adaptation portrays Leia ( Ann Sachs ) and Bail Organa &apos;s ( Stephen Elliott ) discovery of the Death Star&apos;s existence and Leia&apos;s mission to steal the space station&apos;s schematics. The first level of LucasArts&apos; Dark Forces gives the player a supporting role in Leia&apos;s mission, while a mission in Battlefront II tasks the player with acting as a stormtrooper or Darth Vader in an attempt to recover the plans and capture Leia. Steve Perry &apos;s novel Shadows of the Empire describes a mission that leads to the Rebels learning of the second Death Star&apos;s existence, and that mission is playable in LucasArts&apos; X-Wing Alliance combat flight simulator. Numerous LucasArts titles recreate the movies&apos; attacks on the Death Stars, and the Death Star itself is a controllable weapon in the Rebellion and Empire at War strategy game. A Death Star variation appears in Kevin J. Anderson &apos;s novel Darksaber. The first Death Star is depicted in various sources of having a crew of 265,675, as well as 52,276 gunners, 607,360 troops, 30,984 stormtroopers, 42,782 ship support staff, and 180,216 pilots and support crew.
