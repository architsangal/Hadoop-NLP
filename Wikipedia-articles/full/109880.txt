According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 0.8 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. [ what does this mean? Metropolitan area? Or what? Kingston isn&apos;t even in Rome&apos;s county. January 2011 ] [ January 2011 ] [ 11 mi ] [ 12 mi ] Rome and Cartersville both claim Kingston as part of their &quot; area. &quot; Kingston is from Cartersville, and from Rome. [ History ] Native American tribes once inhabited the area. Mississippian culture were in the vicinity until abrout 1500 AD. Cherokee removal was accomplished locally by 1838. Europeans settlers were moved in as early as 1832, after a land lottery. On April 12, 1862, James J. Andrews with 18 Ohio soldiers [US] in disguise, and 1 civilian, having seized the locomotive General Big Shanty intending to wreck the Western and Atlantic Railroad, were forced to side track here and wait for the southbound freights to pass. After a long delay &quot; The General &quot; continued north. Pursuing from Big Shanty, William Allen Fuller (Conductor) led a crew which used a push-car and other means and eventually caught the highjackers. { Marker db m13963 } 250 Confederate and two Federal soldiers mostly died of wounds, disease and sickness in the Confederate hospitals located here during 1862-1864. These men were wounded in the Battles of Perryville, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and in the Dalton-Kingston Campaign. The patients were moved to Atlanta in May 1864 to avoid capture by Federals. The hospitals were later used by the Federals. The dead are buried in unmarked graves nearby. { marker db m13980 } { marker 008-40 } Sherman made his headquarters in the Hargis house May 16–19, for reorganization of forces in the campaign that would end at Atlanta. Assuming Johnston&apos;s army had moved, from Adairsville, directly on Kingston and the river crossings south, May 18, led Sherman to concentrate his forces here—only to discover that Johnston had gone directly to Cassville where, without making a stand, he retreated to Allatoona May 20. Sherman countered May 23, by moving due south. { Marker db m13965 } On May 18, 1864, Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee &apos;s A.C. (Army Corps) marched from Adairsville on the road parallel to the Western and Atlantic Railroad enroute to Cass Station. He turned east on this road to join General Polk &apos;s and General Hood &apos;s Confederate Corps at Cassville which had moved on the direct Adairsville - Cassville road. Federal General Sherman &apos;s erred when he assumed that all of Confederate Major General Joseph E. Johnston &apos;s army had marched from Adairsville, as Hardee had, to Kingston. This resulted in his ordering his forces concentrated here—discovering later that the Confederate Army was [ 5.5 mi ] east at Cassville and not at the Etowah River south of Kingston. { Marker db m13962 } On May 19 Union Generals Daniel Butterfield and Major General Joseph Hooker (20th A.C.) were headquartered at the house of Confederate Colonel Hawkins F. Price, a state senator who had voted Georgia Secession in 1861. Hooker had been ordered from Adairsville to Kingston, on false reports that Johnston [CS] had retreated there. South of the Price house Hooker discovered that Johnston had gone to Cassville. { Marker db m13497 } On May 19, 1864, The IV Corps, followed by the XIV Corps reached Kingston at 8 a.m. The IVth turned east to Cassville. A division of the XIVth sent to Gillem&apos;s bridge, Etowah River, found no retreating Confederates. Johnston&apos;s forces were at Cassville, [ 5.5 mi ] east. McPherson&apos;s XV Corps and XVI Corps, moving south from Barnsley&apos;s, camped on Woolley&apos;s plantation [ 2 mi ] West. IV Corps, XX Corps and XXIII Corps were at Cassville. { Markers db m13961 and db m13195 } May 19, 1864, McPherson&apos;s Army (XVth &amp; XVIth Corps) [US] arched from Barnsley&apos;s and camped on the Woolley Plantation. This right wing of Sherman&apos;s advance, Kingston to Dallas, crossed the river, heading south, on Woolley&apos;s Bridge crossing the Ethowah River, May 23d. { Marker 008-11 } On October 11, 1964, while encamped on the Woolley Plantation, the Ohio soldiers of the XXIIId [US] Corps, voted in a State Election. { Marker db m13925 } In 1864, a road southward from Wooley&apos;s Bridge (Etowah River) crossed the road near this point and ran to Van Wert (Rockmart) and Dallas. This was the route of Federal Major General James B. McPherson &apos;s Army of the Tennessee (15th and 16th Corps), [US] right wing of forces under Sherman moving from Kingston to the Dallas front, May 23, 24.

Wofford surrendered 3000 to 4000 soldiers to Union Brigadier General Henry M. Judah. These were the last significant Confederate regulars to surrender east of the Mississippi.
