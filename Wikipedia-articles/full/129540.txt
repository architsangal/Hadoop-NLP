[ September 2009 ] { Eugene Cernan operating the } { Lunar rover during } { Apollo 17 } Thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly in the Apollo manned lunar landing program. Twenty-four of these left Earth ’s orbit and flew around the Moon ( Apollo 1, Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were low Earth orbit spacecraft testing missions). In addition, nine astronauts flew Apollo spacecraft in the Apollo Applications Programs Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Twelve of these astronauts walked on the Moon’s surface, and six of those drove a lunar rover on the Moon. While three astronauts flew to the Moon twice, none of them landed on the Moon more than once. The nine Apollo missions to the Moon occurred between December of 1968 and December of 1972. Apart from these twenty-four people who visited the Moon, no human being has gone beyond low Earth orbit. They have, therefore, been farther from the Earth than anyone else. They are also the only people to have directly viewed the far side of the Moon. The twelve who walked on the Moon are the only people ever to have set foot on an astronomical object other than the Earth. Of the twenty-four lunar astronauts taking part in the Moon missions, two went on to command a Skylab mission, one commanded Apollo-Soyuz, one flew as commander for shuttle approach and landing tests and two went on to command orbital shuttle missions. A total of twenty-four Apollo-era astronauts (as well as pre-Apollo astronaut John Glenn ) flew the space shuttle. [ Project Apollo fatalities ] Apollo 1 crew (L–R: Gus Grissom, Ed White, Roger Chaffee) Although there were no in-flight fatalities in the Apollo program, three astronauts died in a ground test accident while preparing for Apollo 1, which was to have been the first manned mission in a low Earth orbit.

[ People who have walked on the Moon ] [ Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon ] Twelve people have walked on the Moon, of whom nine are currently still living. All human landings took place between July 1969 and December of 1972 as part of the Apollo program.

Americans alive at the time remember it as the night of July 20, 1969 (Armstrong set foot on the Moon at 10:56 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time), but the official NASA chronology was kept in GMT, so the first step was 2:56 a.m. on the 21st: NASA Armstrong had left the US Navy and was already a NASA employee when he and Elliot See became the first civilian astronauts in Astronaut Group 2.

Harrison Schmitt 37y 5m 8d NASA Regarding &quot; the last man to walk on the Moon &quot;, Schmitt is the last person to arrive (as Cernan got out of the Apollo Lunar Module first), but Cernan is the last person to leave (after final EVA, Schmitt went inside the module first). Duke was the youngest, at age 36 (+6mo); Shepard was the oldest, at age 47 (+2mo). James A. Lovell, John W. Young and Eugene Cernan are the only three astronauts to fly more than one lunar mission (two each). Of these three, only Lovell did not walk on the lunar surface. Lovell and Fred Haise were prevented from walking on the Moon by the malfunction on Apollo 13 that resulted in the mission being aborted. Haise was scheduled to walk on the Moon as commander of Apollo 19 prior to that mission’s cancellation on September 2, 1970. Joe Engle had also trained to explore the Moon with Cernan as the backup crew for Apollo 14, but Engle was later replaced by geologist Harrison Schmitt when the primary crew for Apollo 17 was selected. Schmitt had been crewed with Dick Gordon in anticipation for Apollo 18. When Apollo 18 was canceled, Schmitt bumped Engle, leaving Gordon as the last Apollo astronaut who had trained extensively for lunar exploration without ever getting a chance to fly a lunar landing. [ Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing ] Apollo 8 was the first manned mission to reach the Moon (Frank Borman, center) Twelve more people have been within a few hundred kilometers of the Moon. On each of the missions listed above one astronaut orbited the Moon while the other two landed. In addition, the Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 13 missions had a three-person crew and closely encountered the Moon, entering orbit in the case of the former two missions, while Apollo 13 only passed around it. John Young and Eugene Cernan both flew to the Moon twice, each setting foot on it as part of their second journey, while Jim Lovell is the only human to have flown to the Moon twice without landing on it.

Ronald Evans 39 Apollo 17 December 7–19, 1972 Navy [ Other Apollo astronauts ] Dave Scott observes from command module of Apollo 9 Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 orbited the Earth only; therefore these five Apollo astronauts never went to the Moon: Walter Schirra – Apollo 7 Donn Eisele – Apollo 7 (was on backup-crew for Apollo 10 ) Walter Cunningham – Apollo 7 James McDivitt – Apollo 9 Rusty Schweickart – Apollo 9 (was on backup-crew for Skylab 2 ) David Scott from Apollo 9 would command Apollo 15 and thus made a lunar landing. [ Backup crew-members who never flew an Apollo flight ] Each Apollo flight had a backup crew who trained to carry out the mission if the prime crew member was unable to fly. Only one backup crew member was ever used: Jack Swigert switched places with Ken Mattingly after Mattingly had been exposed to German measles a few days prior to the launch of Apollo 13. (Mattingly later flew aboard Apollo 16 ). However, shortly before the launch of Apollo 17, Eugene Cernan badly injured his leg playing softball and only just recovered in time for the mission. Had he been unable to fly he could have been replaced by back-up commander John Young, who would have become the only person to walk on the Moon twice and would have done so on consecutive missions. Gordon Cooper – backup commander for Apollo 10 – was replaced as commander on Apollo 14 by Alan Shepard and resigned from NASA in 1970. Joe Engle – backup lunar module pilot for Apollo 14 – lost the primary pilot slot on Apollo 17 to Harrison Schmitt after the cancellation of Apollo 18. Engle later flew on the Space Shuttle &apos;&apos;Enterprise&apos;&apos; during the Approach and Landing Tests program in 1977, and commanded STS-2 using Columbia with astronaut Richard Truly in 1981. He also commanded Discovery on STS-51-I in 1985.
