The roadmap for peace or &quot; road map &quot; for peace is a plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict proposed by a &quot; quartet &quot; of international entities: the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations. The principles of the plan, originally drafted by U.S. Foreign Service Officer Donald Blome, were first outlined by U.S. President George W. Bush in a speech on June 24, 2002, in which he called for an independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in peace: &quot; The Roadmap represents a starting point toward achieving the vision of two states, a secure State of Israel and a viable, peaceful, democratic Palestine. It is the framework for progress towards lasting peace and security in the Middle East... &quot; { Roadmap For Peace in the Middle East:Israeli/Palestinian Reciprocal Action, Quartet Support&apos;U.S.Department of State, Bureau of Public Affairs,16/7/2003 } { Palestinian Prime Minister } { Mahmoud Abbas, } { United States President } { George W. Bush, and } { Israel i Prime Minister } { Ariel Sharon after reading statement to the press during the closing moments of the Red Sea Summit in } { Aqaba, } { Jordan, June 4, 2003. } [ Concept ] In exchange for statehood, the road map requires the Palestinian Authority to make democratic reforms and abandon the use of violence. Israel, for its part, must support and accept the emergence of a reformed Palestinian government and end settlement activity of the Gaza Strip and West Bank as the Palestinian terrorist threat is removed. [ January 2010 ] [ Process ] The road map comprises three goal-driven phases with the ultimate goal of ending the conflict as early as 2005. However, as a performance-based plan, progress will require and depend upon the good faith efforts of the parties, and their compliance with each of the obligations quartet put the plan together, with amendments following consultations with Israelis and Palestinians: Phase I (as early as May 2003): End to Palestinian violence; Palestinian political reform; Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian cities and freeze on settlement expansion; Palestinian election s. Phase II (as early as June–December 2003): International Conference to support Palestinian economic recovery and launch a process, leading to establishment of an independent Palestinian state with provisional borders; revival of multilateral engagement on issues including regional water resources, environment, economic development, refugees, and arms control issues; Arab states restore pre- intifada links to Israel (trade offices, etc.). Phase III (as early as 2004–2005): second international conference; permanent status agreement and end of conflict; agreement on final borders, clarification of the highly controversial question of the fate of Jerusalem, refugees and settlements; Arab state to agree to peace deals with Israel. [ Israel&apos;s conditions ] On May 12, 2003 it was reported that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had rejected Israel&apos;s main road map requirement, a settlement freeze, as &quot; impossible &quot; due to the need for settlers to build new houses and start families. Ariel Sharon asked then US Secretary of State Colin Powell &quot; What do you want, for a pregnant woman to have an abortion just because she is a settler? &quot;. { Powell visit highlights problems, 12/05/2003 } On May 25, 2003 the Israeli government announced fourteen conditions to the plan. { Israeli Response to the Road Map on May 25, 2003 } These included: The total dismantling of all militant Palestinian sub-groups, collection of all illegal weapons and their destruction Cessation of violence and incitement against Israel, but the Roadmap will not state that Israel must cease violence and incitement against the Palestinians Palestine as a demilitarized state, and Israeli control of the entry and exit of all persons and cargo, plus its airspace and electromagnetic spectrum (Radio, television, radar, etc.) Declaration of Israel&apos;s right to exist as a Jewish state, as well as the waiver of any right of return of refugees to Israel Issues pertaining to the final settlement such as Israeli settlement in &quot; Judaea, Samaria &quot; ( West Bank ) and Gaza (excluding a settlement freeze and illegal outposts), the status of the Palestinian Authority and its institutions in Jerusalem, and all other matters pertaining to the final settlement will not be discussed prior to the final settlement talks. No reference other than the key provisions of U.N. Resolution 242 and 338. [ Start of implementation ] The first step on the road map was the appointment of the first-ever Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen,) by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The United States and Israel demanded that Arafat be neutralized or sidelined in the road map process, claiming that he had not done enough to stop Palestinian attacks against Israelis while in charge. The United States refused to release the road map until a Palestinian prime minister was in place. Abbas was appointed on March 19, 2003, clearing the way for the release of the road map&apos;s details on April 30, 2003. On May 27, 2003, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stated that the &quot; occupation &quot; of Palestinian territories was &quot; a terrible thing for Israel and for the Palestinians &quot; and &quot; can&apos;t continue endlessly. &quot; Sharon&apos;s phraseology prompted shock from many in Israel, leading to a clarification that by &quot; occupation, &quot; Sharon meant control of millions of Palestinian lives rather than actual physical occupation of land. The Prime Minister&apos;s Cabinet approved the road map with 14 reservations. { Israel&apos;s road map reservations, Haaretz, 27/05/2003 } President Bush visited the Middle East from June 2–4, 2003 for two summits in an attempt to push the road map as part of a seven-day overseas trip through Europe and Russia. On June 2, Israel freed about 100 Palestinian prisoners before the first summit in Egypt as a sign of goodwill. The list consisted largely of administrative detainees who were due to be released. Subsequent prisoner releases involved members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, but the government insisted that those slated for release did not have Israeli &quot; blood on their hands. &quot; [ April 2011 ] In Egypt on June 3, President Bush met with the leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Bahrain, and with Prime Minister Abbas. The Arab leaders announced their support for the road map and promised to work on cutting off funding to terrorist groups. On June 4, Bush headed to Jordan to meet directly with Ariel Sharon and Mahmoud Abbas. [ Halt in implementation ] After Bush left the region, the Palestinians launched a series of terror attacks against Israelis. This threatened to derail the road map plan. On June 5, 2003, the bodies of two Israelis were found near Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital in Jerusalem, beaten and stabbed to death. On June 8, 2003, Hamas leader Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi directed an attack that killed four Israeli soldiers at the Erez Checkpoint in the Gaza Strip. On June 10, 2003, Israeli helicopters fired missiles at a car in Gaza in a failed attempt to assassinate Rantissi; two Palestinians were killed. The next day, a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 17 passengers and bystanders on an Israeli bus. On June 15 Israeli forces entered Gaza killing a Palestinian, { Agreements met with violence } In the following few days, Israel continued its targeting of Hamas leaders with new helicopter attacks. [ The hudna ] On June 29, 2003, a tentative cease-fire ( &quot; hudna &quot; in Arabic ) was reached between the Palestinian Authority and four major Palestinian groups. Islamic Jihad and Hamas announced a joint three-month cease-fire, while Yasser Arafat&apos;s Fatah faction declared a six-month truce. The cease-fire was later joined by the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. One condition of maintaining the truce was a demand for the release of prisoners from Israeli jails, which was not part of the road map process. Despite this, Israel withdrew troops from the northern Gaza Strip and was discussing the transfer of territory to Palestinian control. This coincided with a visit to the region by United States National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. On July 1, 2003, in Jerusalem, Sharon and Abbas held a first-ever ceremonial opening to peace talks, televised live in both Arabic and Hebrew. Both leaders said the violence had gone on too long and that they were committed to the U.S.-led road map for peace. On July 2, Israeli troops pulled out of Bethlehem and transferred control to Palestinian security forces. The plan required that Palestinian police take over from withdrawing Israeli forces and stop any anti-Israeli militant attacks. At the same time, the U.S. announced a $30 million aid package to the Palestinian Authority to help rebuild infrastructure destroyed by Israeli incursions. The hudna quickly collapsed. In an IDF operation to arrest Hamas bombmakers, gunfight broke out in which an Israeli soldier and two alleged Hamas militants were killed. Hamas responded with a suicide bombing on August 12, killing one Israeli civilian. Fatah claimed responsibility for a second suicide bombing on August 12, killing another Israeli citizen. Despite this de facto violation of the hudna, Hamas stated that the cease-fire would continue. Hostilities then escalated: the Israeli army killed Islamic Jihad &apos;s Muhammad Seeder on August 14; the Jerusalem bus 2 massacre by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on August 19, killed 23 and wounded 136 people; and Israeli forces killed Hamas&apos; Isma&apos;il Abu-Shanab on August 21. After the killing of the two high-ranking leaders, Hamas eventually called off the hudna. { http://www.counterpunch.org/avnery08252003.html } In November 2003, the United Nations Security Council endorsed the road map in Resolution 1515 which called for an end to all violence including &quot; terrorism, provocation, incitement and destruction &quot;. By the end of 2003, the Palestinian Authority had not prevented Palestinian terrorism, and Israel had neither withdrawn from Palestinian areas occupied since September 28, 2000, nor frozen settlement expansion. Thus the requirements of Phase I of the road map were not fulfilled, and the road map has not continued further. It is thus currently effectively in limbo. On February 13, 2004 the United States government decided that it would endorse Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&apos;s plan for a unilateral withdrawal of most Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip, adding that &quot;...negotiations were impossible because of Palestinian recalcitrance. &quot; [ http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/politics/13DIPL.html?hp The New York Times U.S. May Support Israeli Approach on Leaving Gaza Steven R. Weisman February 13, 2004 April 10, 2010 ] [ October 2010 H3llBot ] [ Continuation of the road map ] On April 14, 2004, President George W. Bush wrote a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon seeming to herald two significant changes or increased specifications to longstanding but ambiguous U.S. policy which had most recently been embodied in the road map. For the first time during the road map process, Bush indicated his expectations as to the outcome of the final status negotiations. The letter was widely seen as a triumph for Sharon, since Bush&apos;s expectations seemed to favor Israel on two highly contentious issues. Regarding final borders, the letter stated: &quot; In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers, it is unrealistic that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a two-state solution have reached the same conclusion. It is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities... &quot;. Second, regarding the Palestinian refugees &apos; right of return, Bush also stated: &quot; It seems clear that an agreed, just, fair and realistic framework for a solution to the Palestinian refugee issue as part of any final status agreement will need to be found through the establishment of a Palestinian state and the settling of Palestinian refugees there rather than Israel. &quot; On May 8, 2004 in an interview with Egypt &apos;s Al-Ahram newspaper, President George W. Bush clarified the current situation regarding the road map stating: Well, 2005 may be hard, since 2005 is right around the corner. I readily concede the date has slipped some, primarily because violence sprung up. When I laid out the date of 2005, I believe it was around the time I went to Aqaba, Jordan. It was a very meaningful moment, where former Prime Minister Abu Mazen, myself, Prime Minister Sharon and His Majesty, the King of Jordan, stood up and pledged to work together. But we hit a bump in the road -- violence, as well as Abu Mazen being replaced, which changed the dynamic. I don&apos;t want to make any excuses, but nevertheless, I think the timetable of 2005 isn&apos;t as realistic as it was two years ago. Nevertheless, I do think we ought to push hard as fast as possible to get a state in place. And I repeat to you, sir, that part of my frustrations were alleviated with the Quartet making the statement it made the other day -- the Quartet being the EU, Russia, United Nations and the United States, working together. I think we can get the World Bank involved. But there is a certain sense of responsibility that falls upon the Palestinians, reform-minded Palestinians to step up and say, yes, we accept these institutions necessary for a peaceful state to emerge. { http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/689/fr4.htm } On July 18, 2004, United States President George W. Bush stated that the establishment of a Palestinian state by the end of 2005 was unlikely due to instability and violence in the Palestinian Authority. (Le Figaro) In November 2004, Yasser Arafat died at age 75 in a French hospital. Arafat&apos;s powers were divided among his officials, with Mahmoud Abbas elected head of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Rawhi Fattuh sworn in as acting president of the Palestinian Authority. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3984841.stm BBC News Veteran leader Yasser Arafat dies November 11, 2004 April 10, 2010 ] Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said the death could be a turning point for peace if the Palestinians &quot; ceased terrorism &quot; and waged a &quot; war on terror &quot;. The White House simply described the death as a &quot; significant moment in Palestinian history &quot;, and offered condolences. On 8 February 2005, the leaders of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority came together at Sharm el-Sheikh for a summit meeting at which they declared their continuing support for the road map. In his May 26, 2005 joint press conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in the Rose Garden, President Bush said: Any final status agreement must be reached between the two parties, and changes to the 1949 Armistice lines must be mutually agreed to. A viable two-state solution must ensure contiguity of the West Bank, and a state of scattered territories will not work. There must also be meaningful linkages between the West Bank and Gaza. This is the position of the United States today, it will be the position of the United States at the time of final status negotiations. { http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/05/20050526.html } This statement was widely seen as a triumph for Abbas, as many commentators view it as contradictory to his April 14, 2004 letter.

Quandt June 17, 2005 April 10, 2010 ] The Bush administration has made no attempts to clarify any perceived discrepancies between the two statements. In August 2005, the Israelis started their planned disengagement from the Gaza Strip, removing all of its settlements from this area and from a portion of the West Bank. This was widely endorsed around the world and the process, although unilateral on Israel&apos;s part, was co-ordinated with the Palestinian Authority. In early January 2006, Sharon suffered a major stroke and did not awake from an induced coma.

On April 14, 2006 Sharon was declared permanently incapacitated, and Olmert was named interim Prime Minister, becoming Prime Minister on May 4. On 4 June 2006 Ehud Olmert announced he would meet Mahmoud Abbas to resume talks on the Road map. Olmert and Abbas joined breakfast with King Abdullah II of Jordan on 22 June 2006 in Petra. { EuroNews, 22 June 2006 } They pledged to meet again in coming weeks. { AP, 22 June 2006 } On 22 June, Hamas accepted parts of the prisoners&apos; document, which called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders and the creation of a Palestinian state. On 27 June 2006 Hamas and Fatah both accepted the document fully. { Palestinians recognize Israel, CNN, 27 June 2006 } [ 2006: hostilities resume ] In January 2006, the Islamic militant group Hamas won a surprise victory in the Palestinian parliamentary elections.

In Israel, Interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated, &quot; Israel will not conduct any negotiation with a Palestinian government if it includes any members of an armed terror organization that calls for Israel&apos;s destruction. &quot; Bush said the U.S would not deal with Hamas until it renounced its call to destroy Israel. But Hamas co-founder Mahmoud Zahhar refused to renounce violence. &quot; We are not playing terrorism or violence. We are under occupation, &quot; he told BBC World TV. In mid-2006, the 2006 Israel-Gaza conflict started between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Forces in the Gaza strip. Not long after, clashes with Hezbollah in Lebanon precipitated the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. This conflict had a profound impact on the Middle-East crisis surrounding Israel. Controversial armament shipments from the USA were &quot; rushed &quot; to Israel, [ http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/22/world/middleeast/22military.html The New York Times U.S. Speeds Up Bomb Delivery for the Israelis David S.

In October 2006, it was revealed in a Haaretz expose that rampant construction of settlements was ongoing in the West Bank, contrary to Israeli promises to the United States to halt settlement construction. { http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/778767.html } According to the report, many of these settlements were built on private Palestinian property, including properties previously guaranteed by Israel. The report was allegedly kept secret in order to avoid a politicalcrisis with the US. As of mid-June 2007, a Palestinian civil conflict was unfolding, as Hamas had taken control of the Gaza Strip from the Fatah-led forces while Fatah controlled most of the West Bank. In June 2008, Hamas and Israel agreed to a cease-fire which somewhat held until November, 2008. On December 27, 2008, the Gaza War began. On January 21, 2009, Israeli troops completed their pullout from the Gaza Strip [ 2009 Israeli elections ] In January 2009, prior to the February 2009 Israeli elections, the then election front-runner and leader of Israel&apos;s right-wing Likud party, Benjamin Netanyahu, informed Middle East envoy Tony Blair that he would continue the policy of the Israeli governments of Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert by allowing &quot; natural &quot; growth of settlements in the West Bank, in contravention of the Road Map, but not building new ones [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7851140.stm BBC News Likud allow settlement expansion January 26, 2009 April 10, 2010 ] Hillary Clinton said that Israel was in breach of the road map with its plans to demolish 80 Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem that Israel claims were built illegally. { http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1068546.html } [ 2009 President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu debate on settlement freeze ] In June 2009 Netanyahu announced Israel&apos;s acceptance of the Road Map while simultaneously rejecting a settlement freeze which is a main Israeli requirement under the Road Map { http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1092068.html } In rejecting President Obama&apos;s call for a settlement freeze Netanyahu also claimed that settlement expansion, so called &quot; natural growth &quot;, was needed to allow settlers to raise families by moving to new larger houses rather than move to existing houses either elsewhere in the Occupied Territories or in Israel itself.
