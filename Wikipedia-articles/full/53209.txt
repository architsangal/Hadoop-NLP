His most famous work is The Chronicles of Prydain, a series of five high fantasy novels whose conclusion, The High King, was awarded the 1969 Newbery Medal for excellence in American children&apos;s literature. He won U.S. National Book Award s in 1971 and 1982. { &quot; National Book Awards – 1971 &quot;. } { National Book Foundation.

His father was a stockbroker and the family was much affected by the Great Depression. His parents read only newspapers but they did buy books &quot; at the Salvation Army to fill up empty shelves. &quot; { Adam Bernstein (18 May 2007). Lloyd Alexander; Fantasy and Adventure Writer. Washington Post. Page B08. Retrieved 2007-05-18. } Lloyd was a reader of books: &quot; Shakespeare, Dickens, Mark Twain, and so many other were my dearest friends and greatest teachers. I loved all the world&apos;s mythologies; King Arthur was one of my heroes;... &quot; By fifteen he had determined to be a writer. His parents found him a practical job as bank messenger, which inspired a satire that would become his first book published fifteen years later, And Let the Credit Go (1955). He graduated at age sixteen in 1940 from Upper Darby High School, where he was inducted into the school&apos;s Wall of Fame in 1995.

I never in all my life saw them sit down and read a book. So it was always a mystery to them – where do these books come from, and who actually writes them? And our son wants to go into a business like that?!! &quot; He ignored their warnings and &quot; lived to regret not listening &quot;. { Lloyd Alexander Interview Transcript (1999). Interview with Scholastic students. Scholastic Inc. Retrieved 2009-04-17. } Alexander judged that adventure, not college, was the best school for a writer, and that US Army participation in World War II was an opportunity. The army shipped him to Texas where he played the cymbals in band and the organ in chapel. He received combat intelligence training in Maryland, then in Wales, before late wartime deployment in western and southern borderlands of Germany that had been conquered. { &quot; Lloyd Alexander Biography &quot;. Amazon.com. Retrieved 2011-12-27. } He rose to be a staff sergeant in intelligence and counterintelligence. [ December 2011 ] After the war Alexander attended the University of Paris, where he met Janine Denni. They were married in 1946 and soon moved back home (for Lloyd) to Philadelphia. Alexander died on May 17, 2007, two weeks after the death of his wife of sixty-one years. He is buried at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill. His daughter, Madeleine Khalil, died in 1990. [ Writer ] For about fifteen years in Philadelphia, Alexander wrote primarily fiction, non-fiction, and translations for adults. He wrote &quot; novel after novel &quot; for seven years before his first book was published (1955). { About the Author (1999). The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain, Henry Holt and Company, revised and expanded, page 97. } { [About the author] (1973). } { The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain, Henry Holt and Company, first edition, page [88]. } That was &quot; the story of a young person going out into the world for the first time and finding the world a very difficult place indeed. That&apos;s the story that all of us have to tell. &quot; During that time he wrote two non-fiction books for children, biographies for August Bondi and Aaron Lopez. Alexander succeeded on his first try writing fantasy for children, which he later called &quot; the most creative and liberating experience of my life &quot;. The book was Time Cat (1963), a fantasy inspired by one of his pet cats. Solomon would visit the office while Alexander was working, but the author would never see him come or go. Almost forty, he then specialized in children&apos;s fantasy, the genre of his best-known works. His wartime tenure in Wales introduced him to castles and scenery that would inspire settings for many of his books and to Welsh language whose medieval literature — Welsh mythology, especially the Mabinogion — was a source for The Chronicles of Prydain in particular. Those five novels detail the adventures of a young man named Taran, who dreams of being a sword-bearing hero but has only the title Assistant Pig-Keeper. He progresses from youth to maturity and must finally choose whether to be High King of Prydain. Twenty years later, a Disney animated film, The Black Cauldron (1985) was based on the first two books, telling a combined Disney story. After the success of Prydain, Alexander was chosen to be Author-in-Residence at Temple University from 1970 to 1974. [ Sleeman series ed.

Westmark features a former printer&apos;s apprentice involved in rebellion and civil war in a fictional European kingdom around 1800. Vesper Holly is a wealthy and brilliant Philadelphia orphan who has adventures in various fictional countries during the 1870s. { Holly visits five fictional countries and her last adventure is set in and around Philadelphia during the 1876 } { Centennial Exhibition. } There was some controversy about The Fortune Tellers (1993), a picture book illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman. Some felt that the story was European in origin and therefore inappropriate for its African setting. [ Lasky Kathryn Dana L. Fox and Kathy G.

Alexander&apos;s last novel, The Golden Dream of Carlo Chuchio, was published in August 2007. &quot; I have finished my life work, &quot; he said about the book before he died. According to Dictionary of Literary Biography, Alexander&apos;s books had &quot; the special depth and insight provided by characters who not only act, but think, feel and struggle with the same kinds of problems that confuse and trouble people in the twentieth century. &quot; In describing the influences on his writing, Alexander once said, &quot; Shakespeare, Dickens, Mark Twain and so many others were my dearest friends and greatest teachers. I loved all the world&apos;s mythologies: King Arthur was one of my heroes. &quot; [ Prior Elizabeth Biography of Lloyd Alexander http://www.cas.usf.edu/lis/alis/lis5937/prior/eliza.htm 2011-12-29 http://web.archive.org/web/20071111192956/http%3A//www.cas.usf.edu/lis/alis/lis5937/prior/eliza.htm 11 November 2007 ] [ Honors ] Alexander first garnered significant critical acclaim with his The Chronicles of Prydain series.
