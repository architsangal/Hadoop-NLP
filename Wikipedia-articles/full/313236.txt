However, the berries are eaten by bird s, which are not affected by the toxin because the small seed s with very hard outer shells remain intact in the digestive system and are eliminated whole. [ December 2011 ] The genus comprises about 25 species of perennial herbs, shrub s, and tree s growing from [ 1 to 25 m ft on ] tall. They have alternate simple leaves, pointed at the end, with entire or crinkled margins; the leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen. The stems are green, pink or red. The flower s are greenish-white to pink, produced in long raceme s at the ends of the stems. They develop into globose berries 4–12  mm diameter, green at first, ripening dark purple to black. { Flora of China: &apos;&apos;Phytolacca&apos;&apos; } { Flora of North America: &apos;&apos;Phytolacca&apos;&apos; } { MacBride, J.

It is a symbol of Uruguay, Argentina and gaucho culture. P. weberbaueri from Peru also grows to tree size. Both species have massively buttressed bases to their trunks, and very soft wood with a high water storage capacity which makes them resistant to grass fires and drought.
