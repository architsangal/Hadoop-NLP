[ Creating High-Growth Companies http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video%3D3000041193 August 24, 2011 ] [ Life and career ] Case was born and grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, [ http://starbulletin.com/2006/08/01/business/story03.html Steve Case immerses himself in life after AOL Bob Van Voris, Bloomberg News Honolulu Star-Bulletin 2006-08-01 ] where he graduated from the private Punahou School (Class of 1976) and attended Central Union Church. Case graduated from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1980 with a degree in political science. For the next two years he worked as an assistant brands manager at Procter &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1982 he joined Pizza Hut Inc. in Wichita, Kansas, serving as manager of new pizza marketing. In January 1983, his older brother Dan, an investment banker, introduced him to Bill von Meister, CEO of Control Video Corporation. The company was marketing a service called GameLine for the Atari 2600 video game console that allowed users to download games via a phone line and modem. After that meeting, von Meister hired Case as a marketing consultant.

Bill Von Meister ] Later that year, the company nearly went bankrupt and one of its investors, Frank Caufield, had his friend Jim Kimsey brought in as a manufacturing consultant. Case later joined the company as a full-time marketing employee. In 1985, Case helped found Quantum Computer Services, an online services company, from the remnants of Control Video. Kimsey became CEO of the newly renamed Quantum Computer Services and promoted Case to vice president of marketing, and in 1987 promoted him again to executive vice president. Kimsey groomed Case to become chairman and CEO when Kimsey retired, and the transition formally took place in 1991 (CEO) and 1995 (chairman). As part of the changes that gave birth to Quantum, Case changed the company&apos;s strategy, creating an online service called Quantum Link (Q-Link for short) for the Commodore 64 in 1985 with programmer (and AOL co-founder) Marc Seriff. In 1988, Quantum began offering the AppleLink online service for Apple and PC-Link for IBM compatible computers. In 1991 he changed the company name to America Online and merged the Apple and PC services under the AOL name; the new service reached 1 million subscribers by 1994, and Q-Link was terminated October 31 of that year. AOL pioneered the concept of social media, as its focus from day one was on communication features such as chatrooms, instant messaging and forums. [ http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/fall2000/mcatee/ AOL A History June 13, 2011 ] Case believed that the &quot; killer app &quot; was community — people interacting with each other — and that was the driver of much of AOL&apos;s early success. By contrast, competitive services of the time such as Prodigy funded by IBM and Sears, focused on shopping and CompuServe focused on being an information utility. [ http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/business_politics/49_steve_case.html Steve Case Biography AskMen June 13, 2011 ] AOL&apos;s strategy was to make online services available and accessible to the mass market by making them affordable, easy to use, useful and fun. [ http://topics.wsj.com/person/C/steve-case/603 Steve Case The Wall Street Journal June 13, 2011 ] At at time when competing services like CompuServe were charging for each minute of access (which varied based on modem speeds and added extra charges for premium services), beginning in 1996, AOL priced its service at $19.95 per month of unlimited use of basic tier services. [ http://www.webhostingreport.com/learn/aol.html The History of AOL WebHostingReport.com June 11, 2011 ] Within three years, AOL&apos;s userbase grew to 10 million,ultimately reaching 26.7 million subscribers at its peak in 2002. [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AAol Wikipedia:AOL June 14, 2011 ] Among many initiatives in the early years of AOL, Case personally championed many innovative online interactive titles and games, including graphical chat environments Habitat (1986) and Club Caribe (1989), the first online interactive fiction series QuantumLink Serial by Tracy Reed (1988), Quantum Space, the first fully automated Play by email game (1989), and the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons title Neverwinter Nights, the first Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game ( MMORPG ) to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text (1991). After a decade of quick growth, AOL merged with media giant Time Warner in 2001,creating one of the world&apos;s largest media, entertainment and communications companies. The $164 billion acquisition was completed in January 2000 but quickly ran into trouble as part of the dot-com recession, compounded by accounting scandals. Case announced his resignation as chairman in January 2003, although he remained on the company&apos;s board of directors for almost three more years.
