[ Yorkshire England Yorkshire unknown Indo-European Germanic West Germanic Anglo Frisian Anglic English IPA ] Location of Yorkshire within England. The Yorkshire dialect refers to the varieties of English used in the Northern England historic county of Yorkshire. Those varieties are often referred to as Broad Yorkshire or Tyke. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/voices2005/pete_2.shtml Tyke: It&apos;s all the Vikings&apos; fault (sort of) 2008-04-16 Keane Peter BBC BBC Bradford and West Yorkshire ] The dialect has roots in older languages such as Old English and Old Norse; it should not be confused with modern slang. The Yorkshire Dialect Society exists to promote use of the dialect in both humour and in serious linguistics; there is also an East Riding Dialect Society. Yorkshire is generally not as stigmatised as other dialects, and has been used in classic works of literature such as Wuthering Heights. Studies have shown that accents in the West Riding (that is, mostly, modern West and South Yorkshire) are generally popular and are associated with common sense, loyalty and reliability.

BBC BBC Bradford and West Yorkshire 2006-10-05 2007-01-05 ] { Yorkshire named top twang as Brummie brogue comes bottom | UK news | guardian.co.uk } [ Geographic distribution ] Traditionally, there was not one dialect in Yorkshire but several. The Survey of English Dialects identified many different accents in Yorkshire. The Yorkshire Dialect Society draws a border roughly at the River Wharfe between two main zones. The area to the southwest of the river is more influenced by Mercia n dialect whilst that to the northeast is more influenced by Northumbrian dialect. The distinction was first made by A.J. Ellis in On Early English Pronunciation. It was approved of by Joseph Wright, the founder of the Yorkshire Dialect Society and the author of the English Dialect Dictionary. Investigations at village level by the dialect analysts Sheard (1906), Stead (1945) and Rohrer (1950) mapped a border between the two areas. { The Yorkshire Dialect Border } Over time, speech has become closer to Standard English and some of the features that once distinguished one town from another have disappeared. In 1945, JA Sheard predicted that various influences &quot; will probably result in the production of a standard West Riding dialect &quot;, and KM Petyt found in 1985 that &quot; such a situation is at least very nearly in existence &quot;. { KM Petyt, &quot; ‘Dialect’ and ‘Accent’ in Industrial West Yorkshire &quot;, page 327, John Benjamins Publishing, 1985 } However, the accent of Hull and East Yorkshire remains markedly different. The accent of the Middlesbrough area has some similarities with Geordie. { Joan C. Beal, An Introduction to Regional Englishes, Edinburgh University Press, 2010, pages 95–99 } The East Riding dialect has many similarities with the Danish language. The West Riding is less pure in its influence, also containing elements of Icelandic, Norman and Saxon. However, many of the characteristics that have sharply divided the two areas have now passed out of use. For example, it would be very rare to hear someone from the East Riding say &quot; down south &quot; as doon sooth anymore, just as it would be rare for someone from the West Riding to say &quot; eat meat &quot; as eit meit anymore. One anomalous case in the West Riding is Royston, which absorbed migrants from the Black Country at the end of the 19th century. The speech of Royston contrasts with that of nearby Barnsley, as it retains some Black Country features. { Where the Black Country meets Black Barnsley, Kate Burland, University of Sheffield } Other northern English dialects include Geordie (spoken in Newcastle upon Tyne) Pitmatic (spoken in Durham and Northumberland) Scouse (spoken in Liverpool) Mackem (spoken in Sunderland) Mancunian (spoken in Manchester) Lancashire dialect and accent, which varies across the county. [ Pronunciation ] Some features of Yorkshire pronunciation are general features of northern English accents. Many of them are listed in the northern English accents section on the English English page. For example, Yorkshire speakers have short [ [a] ] in words like bath, grass and chance. The long [ [ɑː] ] of southern English is widely disliked in these words. { KM Petyt, ‘Dialect’ and ‘Accent’ in Industrial West Yorkshire, page 286, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1985 } [ ʊ ] [ ʊ ] [ a ] [ a ] [ ɛː ] [ əː ] [ ɛː ] [ ɛə ] [ ɛː ] [ eː ] [ aː ] [ aː ] [ ɔː ] [ əː ] [ ɔː ] [ aɪ ] [ aː ] [ ɑɪɪ ] [ aʊ ] [ ɑʊ ] [ aː ] [ eɛ ] [ ɪə ] [ aː ] [ aː ] [ jʊɛː ] [ jʊə ] [ ɛ ] [ ə ] [ ɪ ] [ ə ] Word group Hull Sheffield STRUT BATH NURSE SQUARE FACE PALM GOAT or PRICE or MOUTH or NEAR START CURE LETTER/COMMA end vowel HORSES end vowel [ Vowels ] Some features of Yorkshire pronunciation are general features of northern English accents. Many of them are listed in the northern English accents section on the English English page. For example, Yorkshire speakers have short [ [a] ] in words like bath, grass, and chance as opposed to the long [ [ɑː] ] of Received Pronunciation (RP). Yorkshire speakers tend have no contrast between [ /ʊ/ ] [ /ʌ/ ], making pairs of words like put and putt homophones, both pronounced as the former is in other dialects. [ [ɒ] ] [ [ʊ] ] [ [lɒv] ] [ [e:] ] [ [ɛ:] ] [ [ɛɪ] ] [ [ɛ] ] [ /oʊ/ ] [ [o:] ] [ [ɔ:] ] [ [ɵː] ] [ [ɔʊ] ] [ /l/ ] [ /l/ ] [ [iəl] ] [ /i:l/ ] [ [uəl] ] [ /u:l/ ] [ /e/ ] [ /r/ ] [ /e/ ] [ [ə] ] [ [vərɪ] ] [ [ɛ:] ] [ /ɪə/ ] [ [eɛ] ] [ /aɪ/ ] [ [aː] ] [ [faːv] ] [ [praːz] ] [ [praɪs] ] [ /aʊ/ ] [ [aː] ] [ [aʊ] ] [ /aʊ/ ] [ [ɛ] ] [ [ɛ] ] [ [kɒn&apos;sɜ:n] ] [ [kən&apos;sɜ:n] ] Words such as stut, cut, blood, lunch usually take [ʊ], although [ə] is a middle-class variant.

However, words with gh in the spelling (e.g. straight, weight) are usually pronounced with a diphthong, and some words with ake at the end may be pronounced with, as in tek, mek, and sek for take, make, and sake (but not for bake or cake). Williams and Kerswill in Urban Voices, Arnold, London, 1999, page 146 Words with the RP vowel, as in goat, may have a monophthong or. In a recent trend, a fronted monophthong is common amongst young women BBC – Voices – The Voices Recordings Williams and Kerswill in Urban Voices, Arnold, London, 1999, page 143 It has developed only in the last decade, yet it has now spread from Hull to Bradford. (Watt and Tillotson 2001) In the West Riding, there may be a split whereby a diphthong coexists in other words, especially where it precedes or where there is a W at the end of a word (e.g. grow, low).

Williams and Kerswill in Urban Voices, Arnold, London, 1999, page 147 In Hull and much of the East Riding, the phoneme (as in prize) may become a monophthong before a voiced consonant. For example, five becomes, prize becomes. This does not occur before voiceless consonants, so &quot; price &quot; is. Urban Voices, Arnold, London, 1999, pages 156–7 Williams and Kerswill in Urban Voices, Arnold, London, 1999, pages 157–159 In some areas, especially in the southern half of Yorkshire, there is a tendency to pronounce the phoneme (as in mouth) as a monophthong. This is characteristic of informal speech and may coexist with the more formal. Stoddart, Upton and Widowson in Urban Voices, Arnold, London, 1999, page 75 In Hull, the offset of is strongly labialised. Words like city and many are pronounced with a final in the Sheffield area. What would be a schwa on the end of a word in other accents is realised as in Hull. A prefix to a word is more likely to be stressed than in other accents. For example, &quot; concern &quot; is rather than.

This sound may also be used in words with ea in the spelling: for example, head as, leaves as may take the place of, especially in words such as key, meat, speak. Williams and Kerswill in Urban Voices, Arnold, London, 1999, page 146 Words such as door, floor, four may take a variety of diphthongal pronunciations. KM Petyt, ‘Dialect’ and ‘Accent’ in Industrial West Yorkshire, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1985, pp.132–137 Words with a velar fricative may have for (e.g. brought, fought, thought). Some words that end -ight can still be heard in their dialectal forms. For example, night as and right as or, in some areas,.

Most Yorkshire accents are non-rhotic, but rhotic accents do exist in some areas that border with Lancashire. Much of the East Riding is partially rhotic: a final r on a word, as in letter, hour, and quarter would be pronounced in a rhotic manner, but an r mid-way through a word, as in start, yard, and &apos;burn&apos; would be pronounced in a non-rhotic manner. { See the Welwick and Nafferton accents on the S.E.D. } Some consonant changes amongst the younger generation are typical of younger speakers across England, but are not part of the traditional dialect { Williams and Kerswill in Urban Voices, Arnold, London, 1999, page 159 } : [ [f, v] ] [ /θ, ð/ ] [ /t/ ] [ [r] ] [ /r/ ] Th-fronting so that for.

See also Wells (1982), section 4.4. [ Vocabulary and grammar ] A list of non-standard grammatical features of Yorkshire speech is shown below. In formal settings, these features are castigated and, as a result, their use is recessive. They are most common amongst older speakers and amongst the working-classes.

See this overview and a more detailed page on the Yorkshire Dialect website, and also Jones (2002). This is most likely to be a glottal stop, although traditionally it was or (in the areas that border Lancashire). KM Petyt, ‘Dialect’ and ‘Accent’ in Industrial West Yorkshire, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1985, pages 196–8 Some dialect words persist, although most have fallen out of use. The use of owt and nowt, derived from Old English a wiht and ne wiht, mean anything and nothing. They are pronounced and in North Yorkshire, but as and in most of the rest of Yorkshire. Other examples of dialect still in use include flayed (scared), laik (play), roar (cry), aye (yes), nay (emphatic &quot; no &quot; ), and all (also), anyroad (anyway) and afore (before). KM Petyt, ‘Dialect’ and ‘Accent’ in Industrial West Yorkshire, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1985, pages 239–240 When making a comparison such as greater than or lesser than, the word &quot; nor &quot; can be used in place of &quot; than &quot;, e.g. better nor him.

Stay here while it shuts might cause a non-local to think that they should stay there during its shutting, when the order really means that they should stay only until it shuts.

KM Petyt, ‘Dialect’ and ‘Accent’ in Industrial West Yorkshire, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1985, page 238 The relative clause may be what rather than that, e.g. other people what I&apos;ve heard. Alternatively there may be no relative clause, e.g. I&apos;ve a sister lives there. [ Contracted negatives ] In informal Yorkshire speech, negatives may be more contracted than in other varieties of English. These forms are shown in the table below. Although the final consonant is written as [ [t] ], this may be realised as [ [?] ], especially when followed by a consonant. { All information in this table: KM Petyt, ‘Dialect’ and ‘Accent’ in Industrial West Yorkshire, pages 182–183, John Benjamins Publishing, 1985 } Word Primary Contraction Secondary Contraction isn&apos;t ɪznt ɪnt wasn&apos;t wɒznt wɒnt doesn&apos;t dʊznt dʊnt didn&apos;t dɪdnt dɪnt couldn&apos;t kʊdnt kʊnt shouldn&apos;t ʃʊdnt ʃʊnt wouldn&apos;t wʊdnt wʊnt oughtn&apos;t ɔ:tnt ɔ:nt needn&apos;t ni:dnt ni:nt mightn&apos;t maɪtnt maɪnt musn&apos;t mʊsnt mʊnt (uncommon) hasn&apos;t aznt ant hadn&apos;t adnt ant Unlike in many other areas of England, haven&apos;t does not become reduced to [ [ant] ].

Grammatical and Lexical Features from Ken Loach Films, Dialectologica 3, page 6 } The dialect is strongest in the 1969 film Kes, filmed around Barnsley with local actors. The films Looks and Smiles (1981) and The Navigators (2001) were both set in Sheffield. Loach has noted that the speech is less regionally-marked in his more recent films and has attributed this to changing speech habits in Yorkshire. { Dialect in Films: Examples of South Yorkshire.
