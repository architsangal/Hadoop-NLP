Last modified 5 July 2010.

There is access to tools such as trophic pyramid s, identification key s, biogeographical modelling and fishery statistics and there are direct species level links to information in other databases such as LarvalBase, GenBank, the IUCN Red List and the Catalog of Fishes. { Gert B and Snoeks J (2004) &quot; FishBase: encyclopaedia and research tool &quot; Page 38, VLIZ Special Publication 17, Brugge, Belgium. } [ 2011 8 ], FishBase included descriptions of 32,100 species and subspecies, 292,500 common name s in almost 300 language s, 50,500 pictures, and references to 46,000 works in the scientific literature. { According to the FishBase web page, accessed 04 September, 2011 } The site receives about 30 million hits per month. { FishBase Usage on the Web FishBase. Updated 10 June 2010. Retrieved 22 July 2011. } [ History ] The origins of FishBase go back to the 1970s, when the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly found himself struggling to test a hypothesis on how the growing ability of fish was affected by the size of their gills. { Bakun A (2011) &quot; The oxygen constraint &quot; Pages 11–23. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-13022-6. } Hypotheses, such as this one, could be tested only if large amounts of empirical data were available. { Palomares MLD and Bailly N (2011) &quot; Organizing and disseminating marine biodiversity information: the Fishbase and SeaLifeBase story &quot; Pages 24–46. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-13022-6. } At the time, fisheries management used analytical models which required estimates for fish growth and mortality. { Monro JL (2011) &quot; Assessment of exploited stock of tropical fishes: an overview &quot; Pages 171–188. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-13022-6. } It can be difficult for fishery scientist s and managers to get the information they need on the species that concern them, because the relevant facts can be scattered across and buried in numerous journal articles, reports, newsletters and other sources. It can be particularly difficult for people in developing countries who need such information. Pauly believed that the only practical way fisheries managers could access the volume of data they needed was to assemble and consolidate all the data available in the published literature into some central and easily accessed repository. { LarvalBase: A Global Information System on Fish Larvae American Fisheries Society, Early Life History Section Newsletter, May 2002, 23(2): 7–9. } Such a database would be particularly useful if the data has also been standardised and validated. This would mean that when scientists or managers need to test a new hypothesis, the available data will already be there in a validated and accessible form, and there will be no need to create a new dataset and then have to validate it. { Froese R (2011) &quot; The science in FishBase &quot; Pages 47–54. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective, Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-13022-6. } Pauly recruited Rainer Froese, and the beginnings of a software database along these lines was encoded in 1988. This database, initially confined to tropical fish, became the prototype for FishBase. FishBase was subsequently extended to cover all finfish, and was launched on the Web in August 1996. It is now the largest and most accessed online database for fish in the world. In 1995 the first CD-ROM was released as &quot; FishBase 100 &quot;. Subsequent CDs have been released annually. The software runs on Microsoft Access which operates only on Microsoft Windows. FishBase covers adult finfish, but does not detail the early and juvenile stages of fish. In 1999 a complimentary database, called LarvalBase, went online under the supervision of Bernd Ueberschär. It covers ichthyoplankton and the juvenile stage of fishes, with detailed data on fish eggs and larvae, fish identification, as well as data relevant to the rearing of young fish in aquaculture. Given FishBase&apos;s success, there was a demand for a database covering forms of aquatic life other than finfish. This resulted, in 2006, in the birth of SeaLifeBase. The long-term goal of SeaLifeBase is to develop an information system modelled on FishBase, but including all forms of aquatic life, both marine and freshwater, apart from the finfish which FishBase specialises in. Altogether, there are about are 300,000 known species in this category. { SeaLifeBase - home page Accessed 21 July 2011. } [ Current organization ] As awareness of FishBase has grown among fish specialists, it has attracted over 1,700 contributors and collaborators. Since the year 2000, FishBase has been supervised by a consortium. The consortium currently consists of nine international institutions, with the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences (IFM-GEOMAR) functioning as the coordinating body. { FishBase Home page.
