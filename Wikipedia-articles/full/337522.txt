Leaders of Open Source Community sided with Microsoft in fighting the patent due to its threat to the free nature of the Web and to the basic established HTML standards. The specific concerns of having one company (Eolas) controlling a critical piece of the Web framework were cited. In March 2004, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) re-examined and initially rejected the patent. Eolas submitted a rebuttal in May 2004. On September 27, 2005, the USPTO upheld the validity of the patent. The PTO ruling rejected the relevance of Pei Wei&apos;s Viola code to the Eolas patent. According to the University of California press release, &quot; In its &apos;Reasons for Patentability/Confirmation&apos; notice, the patent examiner rejected the arguments for voiding UC&apos;s previously approved patent claims for the Web-browser technology as well as the evidence presented to suggest that the technology had been developed prior to the UC innovation.

Eolas won the initial case in August 2003 and was awarded damages of $ [ 521000000 3 ] from Microsoft for infringement. The District Court reaffirmed the jury&apos;s decision in January 2004. In June 2004, Microsoft appealed the case to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2005, the District Court judgment was remand ed, but the infringement and damages parts of the case were upheld. The appeals court ruled that the two Viola-related exhibits that had been thrown out of the original trial needed to be shown to a jury in a retrial. Microsoft quickly filed for a rehearing. In October 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear Microsoft&apos;s appeal, leaving intact the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of Eolas with respect to foreign sales of Microsoft Windows. However, the remand to District Court had not been heard yet. In May 2007, the USPTO agreed to allow Microsoft to argue ownership of the patent after they reissued a Microsoft patent that covers the same concepts as outlined in the Eolas patent, and contains wording that mirrors the Eolas patent.

In February 2012 a Texas jury found that two of Eolas&apos; patents were invalid after testimony from several defendants including Tim Berners-Lee and Pei-Yuan Wei, credited as creator of the Viola browser. The testimony professed that the Viola browser included Eolas&apos; claimed inventions before the filing date (September 7, 1993). There is &quot; substantial evidence that Viola was publicly known and used &quot; before the plaintiffs&apos; alleged conception date, it added.
