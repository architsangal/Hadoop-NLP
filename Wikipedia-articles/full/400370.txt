He is the co-discoverer of the first extrasolar planet s and pulsar planet s. [ Scientific career ] Wolszczan was educated in Poland ( MSc in 1969 and received his PhD in 1975 at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń ), He moved in 1982 to the U.S. to work at Cornell and Princeton University. Later he became an astronomy professor at Pennsylvania State University, where he currently teaches. From 1994 to 2008 he was also a professor at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń. He is a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Working with Dale Frail, Wolszczan carried out astronomical observations from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico which led them to the discovery of the pulsar PSR B1257+12 in 1990. They showed in 1992 that the pulsar is orbited by two planets. Their orbits are 0.36 and 0.47 AU respectively. This was the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the Solar System (over seven hundred are known today). In 1996, Wolszczan was awarded the Beatrice M. Tinsley Prize by the American Astronomical Society, and in 2002, he was pictured on a Polish postage stamp.

[ Involvement with the security service ] On 17 September 2008, Wolszczan acknowledged earlier allegations that, from 1973 until 1988, he had been an informer for the Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs ( Służba Bezpieczeństwa ), the Communist secret police of the former People&apos;s Republic of Poland. However, he insisted that he did no harm to anyone through this activity.
