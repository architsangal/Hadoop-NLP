[ yes ] [ the number the Greek letter Pi (letter) other uses of pi, π, and Π Pi (disambiguation) ] The number ( [ p aɪ ] ) is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle &apos;s circumference to its diameter. The constant, sometimes written pi, is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter &quot; &quot; since the mid-18th century. is an irrational number, which means that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers (such as 22/7 or other fractions that are commonly used to approximate ); consequently, its decimal representation never ends and never repeats. It is a transcendental number a number that cannot be produced with a finite sequence of algebraic operation s (powers, sums, and products). The transcendence of implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle. The digits in the decimal representation of appear to be random, although no proof of this supposed randomness has yet been discovered. For thousands of years, mathematicians have attempted to extend their understanding of, sometimes by computing its value to a high degree of accuracy. Prior to the 16th century, mathematicians such as Archimedes and Liu Hui used geometrical techniques, based on polygons, to estimate the value of. Starting in the 16th century, new algorithms based on infinite series revolutionized the computation of, and were used by mathematicians including Mādhava of Sañgamāgrama, Isaac Newton, Leonhard Euler, Srinivasa Ramanujan, and Carl Friedrich Gauss. In the 20th century, mathematicians and computer scientists discovered new approaches that  – when combined with increasing computer speeds  – extended the decimal representation of to over 10 trillion (10 13 ) digits. Scientific applications generally require no more than 40 digits of, so the primary motivation for these computations is the human desire to break records; but the extensive calculations involved have been used to test supercomputer s and high-precision multiplication algorithms. Because its definition relates to the circle, is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry, especially those concerning circles, ellipses, or spheres. It is also found in formulae from other branches of science, such as cosmology, number theory, statistics, fractal s, thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetism. The ubiquitous nature of makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants, both inside and outside the scientific community: Several books devoted to it have been published; the number is celebrated on Pi Day; and news headlines often contain reports about record-setting calculations of the digits of. Several people have endeavored to memorize the value of with increasing precision, leading to records of over 67,000 digits. [ 3 ] [ Fundamentals ] [ Definition ] The circumference of a circle is slightly more than three times as long as its diameter. The exact ratio is called. is commonly defined as the ratio of a circle &apos;s circumference [ C ] to its diameter [ d ] : [ Arndt Haenel 2006 8 ] \pi = \frac{C}{d}. The ratio [ C/d ] is constant, regardless of the circle&apos;s size. For example, if a circle has twice the diameter [ d ] of another circle it will also have twice the circumference [ C ], preserving the ratio [ C/d ]. This definition of is not universal, because it is only valid in flat (Euclidean) geometry and is not valid in curved (non-Euclidean) geometries. For this reason, some mathematicians prefer definitions of based on calculus or trigonometry that do not rely on the circle. One such definition is: is twice the smallest positive [ x ] for which cosine ( [ x ] ) equals 0. [ Rudin Walter Principles of Mathematical Analysis McGraw-Hill 1976 0-07-054235-X ] {, p 183. } [ Name ] { Leonhard Euler popularized the use of the Greek letter in a work he published in 1748. } The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle&apos;s circumference to its diameter is the Greek letter. That letter can be denoted by the Latin word pi, which is also used to represent the same ratio.

The first mathematician to use the Greek letter to represent the ratio of a circle&apos;s circumference to its diameter was William Jones, who utilized it in 1706 in his work Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos; or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 165 ] {. A facsimile of Jones&apos; text is in } [ Berggren Borwein Borwein 1997 108–109 ] {. } Jones&apos; first use of the Greek letter was in the phrase &quot; 1/2 Periphery ( ) &quot; in the discussion of a circle with radius one. He may have chosen because it was the first letter in the Greek spelling of the word periphery. { See } [ Schepler 1950 220 ] { : } { William Oughtred used the letter circa 1630 to represent the periphery (i.e. circumference) of a circle. } Jones writes that his equations for are from the &quot; ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr. John Machin &quot;, leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 166 ] The Greek letter had been used earlier for geometric concepts. For example, in 1631 it was used by William Oughtred to represent the half-circumference of a circle. After Jones introduced the Greek letter in 1706, it was not adopted by other mathematicians until Euler used it in 1736. Prior to 1736, mathematicians sometimes used letters such as c or p to represent the ratio of the circumference to diameter. Because Euler corresponded heavily with other mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly. In 1748, Euler used in his widely read work Introductio in analysin infinitorum (he wrote: &quot; for the sake of brevity we will write this number as; thus is equal to half the circumference of a circle of radius 1 &quot; ) and thereafter the Greek letter was universally adopted in the Western world.

There are several proofs that π is irrational; they generally require calculus and rely on the reductio ad absurdum technique. The degree to which can be approximated by rational number s (called the irrationality measure ) is not precisely known; estimates have established that the irrationality measure is larger than the measure of [ e ] or ln(2), but smaller than the measure of Liouville number s.

Second, since no transcendental number can be constructed with compass and straightedge, it is not possible to &quot; square the circle &quot;. In other words, it is impossible to construct, using compass and straightedge alone, a square whose area is equal to the area of a given circle. [ Posamentier Lehmann 2004 25 ] Squaring a circle was one of the important geometry problems of the classical antiquity. [ Eymard Lafon 1999 129 ] Amateur mathematicians in modern times have sometimes attempted to square the circle, and sometimes claim success, despite the fact that it is impossible.

The hypothesis that is normal has not been proven or disproven. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 22–23 ] [ http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/pi-random.html Are The Digits of Pi Random?

Yasumasa Kanada has performed detailed statistical analyses on the decimal digits of, and found them consistent with normality; for example, the frequency of the ten digits 0 to 9 were subjected to statistical significance test s, and no evidence of a pattern was found.

Truncating the continued fraction at any point generates a fraction that provides an approximation for; two such fractions (22/7 and 355/113) have been used historically to approximate the constant. Each approximation generated in this way is a best rational approximation; that is, each is closer to than any other fraction with the same or a smaller denominator.

[ History ] [ Chronology of computation of π ] [ Antiquity ] The Great Pyramid at Giza, constructed c.2589–2566  BC, was built with a perimeter of approximately 1760 cubits and a height of 280 cubits; the ratio 1760/280  ≈  6.2857 is about equal to 2  ≈  6.2832. A few pyramidologists conclude from this value that the pyramid builders had knowledge of and deliberately designed the pyramid to incorporate the value. { &quot; We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of, in practice they used it &quot;. } [ Verner M.

F. 1925 Surveys of the Great Pyramids Nature Journal 942–942 ] However, mainstream historians believe that ancient Egyptians had no concept of and that it is merely a coincidence that the ratio of perimeter to height is about 2. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 168 ] { They argue that creation of the pyramid may instead be based on simple ratios of the sides of right-angled triangles (the seked), see } [ Rossi Corinna Architecture and Mathematics in Ancient Egypt Cambridge University Press 2007 978-0-521-69053-9 ] The earliest written approximations of are found in Babylon and Egypt, both within 1 percent of the true value. In Babylon, a clay tablet dated 1900–1600  BC has a geometrical statement that, by implication, treats as 25/8  =  3.1250. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 167 ] In Egypt, the Rhind Papyrus, dated around 1650  BC, has a formula for the area of a circle that treats as (16/9) 2  ≈  3.1605. In India, around 600  BC, the ancient Indian math texts Shulba Sutras, written in Sanskrit, treat as (9785/5568) 2  ≈  3.088. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 168–169 ] In 150  BC, or perhaps earlier, Indian sources treat as \scriptstyle \sqrt{10}  ≈  3.1622. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 169 ] The Hebrew Bible, written between 8th and 3rd centuries  BC, contains two verses which suggest that has a value of three. The two verses, [ 1 Kings 7:23 NKJV ] and [ 2 Chronicles 4:2 NKJV ], discuss a ceremonial pool in the temple of King Solomon with a diameter of ten cubits and a circumference of thirty cubits. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 169–170 ] { Suggestions that the pool had a hexagonal shape or an outward curving rim have been offered to explain the disparity. See } [ Borwein Jonathan M. Bailey David H.

The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of was a geometrical approach utilizing polygons that was used around 250  BC by Greek mathematician Archimedes. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 170 ] This polygonal algorithm remained the primary approach for computing for over 1,000 years, and as a result is sometimes referred to as &apos; &quot; Archimedes&apos; constant &quot;. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 175, 205 ] Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of by drawing regular polygon s inside and outside a circle, and calculating the perimeters of the outer and inner polygons. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 170–171 ] By using the equivalent of 96-sided polygons, he proved that 223/71   Archimedes&apos; upper bound of 22/7 may have led to widespread belief that was equal to 22/7. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 171 ] Around 150 AD, Greek-Roman scientist Ptolemy, in his Almagest, gave a value for of 3.1416, which he may have obtained from Archimedes or from Apollonius of Perga. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 176 ] [ Boyer Merzbach 1991 168 ] Mathematicians using polygonal algorithms reached 39 digits of in 1630, a record only broken in 1699 when infinite series were used to reach 71 digits. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 15–16, 175, 184–186, 205 ] {. Grienberger achieved 39 digits in 1630; Sharp 71 digits in 1699. } { Archimedes developed the polygonal approach to approximating. } In ancient China, values for included 3.1547 (around 0 AD), \scriptstyle \sqrt{10} (100 AD, approximately 3.1623), and 142/45 (third century, approximately 3.1556). [ Arndt Haenel 2006 176–177 ] Around 265 AD, the Wei Kingdom mathematician Liu Hui created a polygon-based iterative algorithm and used it with a 3,072-sided polygon to obtain a value of of  3.1416. [ Boyer Merzbach 1991 202 ] [ Arndt Haenel 2006 177 ] Hui later invented a faster method of calculating and obtained a value of 3.14 with a 96-sided polygon, by taking advantage of the fact that the difference in area of successive polygons forms a geometric series with a factor of  4. The Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi, around 480, calculated that  ≃  355/113 (a fraction which goes by the name Milü in Chinese) using Liu Hui&apos;s algorithm applied to a 12,288-sided polygon. With a correct value for its seven first decimal digits, this value of 3.141592920... would remain the most accurate approximation of available for the next 800 years. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 178 ] In India, astronomer Aryabhata used a value of 3.1416 in his 499 AD work Āryabhaṭīya. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 179 ] Fibonacci in circa 1220 computed 3.1418 using a polygonal method, independent from Archimedes. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 180 ] Italian author Dante apparently employed the value \scriptstyle 3+\sqrt{2}/10  ≃  3.14142. Persian astronomer Jamshīd al-Kāshī produced 16 digits in 1430 using a polygon with 3  x  2 28 sides, which stood as the world record for about 180 years. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 182 ] French mathematician François Viète in 1579 achieved 9 digits with a polygon of 3  x  2 17 sides. Flemish mathematician Adriaan van Roomen arrived at 15 decimal places in 1593. In 1596, Dutch mathematician Ludolph van Ceulen reached 20 digits, a record he later increased to 35 digits (as a result, was called the &quot; Ludolphian number &quot; in Germany until the early 20th century). [ Arndt Haenel 2006 182–183 ] Dutch scientist Willebrord Snellius reached 34 digits in 1621, [ Arndt Haenel 2006 183 ] and Austrian astronomer Christoph Grienberger arrived at 39 digits in 1630, which would remain the most accurate approximation manually achieved using polygonal algorithms. [ Infinite series ] The calculation of was revolutionized in the 16th and 17th centuries by the discovery of infinite series, which are sums containing an infinite number of terms. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 185–191 ] Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute with much greater precision than Archimedes and others who used geometrical techniques. Although infinite series were exploited for most notably by European mathematicians such as James Gregory and Gottfried Leibniz, the approach was first discovered in India sometime between 1400 and 1500 AD. [ Roy 1990 101–102 ] [ Arndt Haenel 2006 185–186 ] The first written description of an infinite series which could be used to compute was written in Sanskrit verse by Indian astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji in the work Tantrasamgraha, dating from around 1500 AD. [ Roy 1990 101–102 ] The series are presented without proof, but proofs are presented in a later Indian work, Yuktibhāṣā, from around 1530 AD. Nilakantha attributes the series to an earlier Indian mathematician, Madhava of Sangamagrama, who lived c. 1350 – c. 1425. Several infinite series are described, including series for sine, tangent, and cosine, which are now referred to as the Madhava series or Gregory–Leibniz series. Madhava used infinite series to estimate to 11 digits around 1400, but that record was beaten around 1430 by the Persian mathematician, Jamshīd al-Kāshī using a polygonal algorithm. [ Joseph 1991 264 ] [[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|alt=A formal portrait of a man, with long hair| Isaac Newton used infinite series to compute to 15 digits, later writing &quot; &quot; I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations &quot;. ]]The first infinite sequence discovered in Europe was an infinite product (rather than an infinite sum, which are more typically used in calculations) found by French mathematician François Viète in 1593: [ Arndt Haenel 2006 187 ] \frac2\pi = \frac{\sqrt2}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}}2 \cdot \cdots The second infinite sequence found in Europe, by John Wallis in 1655, also was an infinite product. The discovery of calculus by English scientist Isaac Newton and German mathematician Leibniz in the 1660s, created the foundation for a large number of infinite series which could be exploited by people who calculated digits of. Newton himself used an arcsin series to compute a 15 digit approximation of in 1665 or 1666, later writing &quot; I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations, having no other business at the time &quot;. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 188 ] {. Newton quoted by Arndt. } In Europe, Madhava&apos;s formula was rediscovered by Scottish mathematician James Gregory in 1671 and Leibniz in 1674: [ Arndt Haenel 2006 188–189 ] \begin{align} \arctan z &amp; {}= z - \frac {z^3} {3} +\frac {z^5} {5} -\frac {z^7} {7} +\cdot \cdots \end{align} This formula, the Gregory–Leibniz series, equals \scriptstyle \pi/4 when evaluated with [ z ] =1. [ Eymard Lafon 1999 53–54 ] In 1699, English mathematician Abraham Sharp used the Gregory–Leibniz series to compute to 71 digits, breaking the previous record of 39 digits, which was set with a polygonal algorithm. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 189 ] The Gregory–Leibniz series is simple, but converges very slowly (that is, approaches the answer gradually) so is not used in modern calculations. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 156 ] In 1706 John Machin utilized the Gregory–Leibniz series to produce an algorithm which converged much faster: [ Arndt Haenel 2006 192–193 ] \frac{\pi}{4} = 4 \, \arctan \frac{1}{5} - \arctan \frac{1}{239}. Machin reached 100 digits of with this formula. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 72–74 ] Other mathematicians created variants, now known as Machin-like formula e, that were used to set several successive records for digits. Machin-like formulae remained the best known method for calculating well into the age of computers and were used to set records for 250 years, culminating in a 620 digit approximation in 1946 by Daniel Ferguson the best approximation calculated without the aid of a calculating device. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 192–196, 205 ] A remarkable record was set by the calculating prodigy Zacharias Dase, who in 1844 employed a Machin-like formula to calculate 200 decimals of in his head at the behest of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. British mathematician William Shanks famously took 15 years to calculate to 707 digits, but made a mistake in the 528th digit, rendering all subsequent digits incorrect.

Given the choice of two infinite series for, mathematicians will generally use the one that converges more rapidly because faster convergence reduces the amount of computation needed to calculate to any given accuracy.

Series that converge even faster include Machin&apos;s series and Chudnovsky&apos;s series, the latter producing 14 correct decimal digits per term.

When Euler solved the Basel problem in 1735, finding the exact value of the sum of the reciprocal squares, he established a connection between and the prime number s that later contributed to the development and study of the Riemann zeta function : [ Posamentier Lehmann 2004 284 ] \frac{\pi^2}{6} = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \cdot \cdots Swiss scientist Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1761 proved that is irrational, meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers. Lambert&apos;s proof utilized a continued fraction representation of the tangent function. { Lambert, Johann, &quot; Mémoire sur quelques propriétés remarquables des quantités transcendantes circulaires et logarithmiques &quot;, reprinted in } [ Berggren Borwein Borwein 1997 129–140 ] {. } French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre proved in 1794 that 2 is also irrational. In 1882, German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that was transcendental, confirming a conjecture made by both Legendre and Euler.

[ Arndt Haenel 2006 205 ] Using an arctan infinite series, a team led by George Reitwiesner and John von Neumann used the ENIAC computer to compute 2,037 digits of in 1949, a calculation that took 70 hours of computer time. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 197 ] {. See also } [ Reitwiesner 1950 ] {. } The record, always relying on arctan series, was broken repeatedly (7,480 digits in 1957; 10,000 digits in 1958; 100,000 digits in 1961) until 1 million digits was reached in 1973. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 197 ] Two additional developments around 1980 once again accelerated the ability to compute. First, the discovery of new iterative algorithm s for computing, which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of fast multiplication algorithms that could multiply large numbers together very rapidly. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 15–17 ] The fast multiplication algorithms are particularly important in computer-based computations, because the majority of the computer&apos;s time is typically spent performing multiplications. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 131 ] Fast multiplication algorithms include the Karatsuba algorithm, Toom–Cook multiplication, and Fourier transform based methods. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 132, 140 ] { is given by : \scriptstyle \pi \approx \frac{(a_n + b_n)^2}{4 t_n}. } The iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975–1976 by American physicist Eugene Salamin and Australian scientist Richard Brent. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 87 ] These algorithms were unique because they utilized an iterative approach rather than an infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value. Salamin and Brent were not the first to discover the iterative approach for : It was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss, in what is now termed the arithmetic–geometric mean method (AGM method) or Gauss–Legendre algorithm. The algorithm, as modified by Salamin and Brent, is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm. The iterative algorithms were widely used following 1980 because the iterative algorithms have the potential to be faster than infinite series algorithms: Whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits by a fixed amount for each added term, iterative algorithms generally multiply the number of correct digits at each step. For example, the Brent-Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, the Canadian brothers John and Peter Borwein produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987 they discovered an iterative algorithm that increases the number of digits five times each iteration. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 111 (5 times); pp 113–114 (4 times) ] {. See } [ Borwein Borwein 1987 ] { for details of algorithms. } Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician Yasumasa Kanada to set several records for computing between 1995 and 2002. The rapid convergence of iterative algorithms comes at a price: The iterative algorithms require significantly more memory usage than infinite series.

For most numerical calculations involving, a handful of digits provide sufficient precision. According to Jörg Arndt and Christoph Haenel, thirty-nine digits are sufficient to perform most cosmological calculations, because that is the accuracy which is necessary to calculate the diameter of the observable universe with a precision of one atom. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 17 ] {. Accounting for additional digits needed to compensate for computational } { round-off errors, Arndt concludes that a few hundred digits would suffice for any scientific application. } Despite this, people have worked strenuously to compute to thousands and millions of digits. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 17–19 ] The desire for large number of digits may be partly ascribed to the human compulsion to break records, as new records for computing often make news headlines around the world.

New infinite series were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s which are as fast as iterative algorithms, yet simpler and less memory intensive. The fast iterative algorithms were anticipated in 1914, when the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan published dozens of innovative new formulae for, remarkable for their elegance, mathematical depth and rapid convergence. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 103–104 ] One of his formulae, based on modular equation s, was: \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2 \sqrt 2}{9801} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}. This series converges much more rapidly than most arctan series, including Machin&apos;s formula. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 104 ] Ramanujan&apos;s formula was not used for calculating digits of until Bill Gosper used it in 1985 to set a record of 17 million digits. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 104, 206 ] Ramanujan&apos;s formulae anticipated the modern algorithms developed by the Borwein brothers and the Chudnovsky brothers. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 110–111 ] The Chudnovsky formula developed in 1987 is: \frac{426880 \sqrt{10005}}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(6k)! (13591409 + 545140134k)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 (-640320)^{3k}}. which produces 14 digits of per term. [ Eymard Lafon 1999 254 ] The Chudnovsky formula has been used for several record-setting calculations including the first calculation of over one billion (10 9 ) digits in 1989 by the Chudnovsky brothers, 2.7 trillion (2.7×10 12 ) digits by Fabrice Bellard in 2009, and 10 trillion (10 13 ) digits in 2011 by Alexander Yee and Shigeru Kondo.

The algorithms are called spigot algorithm s because, like water dripping from a spigot, they produce single digits of that are not reused after they are calculated. { Gibbons, Jeremy, &quot; Unbounded Spigot Algorithms for the Digits of Pi &quot;, 2005. Gibbons produced an improved version of Wagon&apos;s algorithm. } This is in contrast to infinite series or iterative algorithms, which retain and use all intermediate digits until the final result is produced. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 77–84 ] American mathematicians Stan Wagon and Stanley Rabinowitz produced a simple spigot algorithm in 1995.

Another spigot algorithm that originated in 1995 is the BBP digit extraction algorithm discovered by Simon Plouffe: [ Arndt Haenel 2006 117, 126–128 ] [ Bailey, David H.; Borwein, Peter B.; and Plouffe, Simon 1997 April On the Rapid Computation of Various Polylogarithmic Constants Mathematics of Computation 66 218 903–913 http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/digits.pdf PDF 10.1090/S0025-5718-97-00856-9 ] \pi = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{16^k} \left( \frac{4}{8k + 1} - \frac{2}{8k + 4} - \frac{1}{8k + 5} - \frac{1}{8k + 6}\right). This formula was a breakthrough in calculating because it can produce any individual hexadecimal digit of without calculating all the preceding digits. From the hexadecimal digit, octal or binary digits may be readily extracted. Variations of the algorithm have been discovered, but no digit extraction algorithm has yet been found which rapidly produces decimal digits. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 128 ] {. Plouffe did create a decimal digit extraction algorithm, but it is slower than full, direct computation of all preceding digits. } An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record computations: After a new record is claimed, the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal, and then a digit extraction algorithm is used to calculate several random hexadecimal digits near the end, and if they match, it provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct. Between 1998 and 2000, the distributed computing project PiHex used Bellard&apos;s formula (a modification of the BBP algorithm) to compute the quadrillionth (10 15 th) bit of, which turned out to be 0.

Formulae from other branches of science also include in some of their important formulae, including sciences such as statistics, fractals, thermodynamics, mechanics, cosmology, number theory, and electromagnetism. [ Geometry and trigonometry ] The area of the circle equals times the shaded area. appears in formulae for areas and volumes of geometrical shapes based on circles, such as ellipse s, sphere s, cones, and tori. Some of the more common formulae that involve are: [ Bronshteĭn Semendiaev 1971 200, 209 ] [ r ] [ r ] [ r ] [ r ] The circumference of a circle with radius is 2 \pi r The area of a circle with radius is \pi r^2 The volume of a sphere with radius is \tfrac43\pi r^3 The surface area of a sphere with radius is 4 \pi r^2 appears in definite integrals that describe circumference, area or volume of shapes generated by circles. For example, an integral which specifies half the area of a circle of radius one is given by: [ Semicircle Semicircle ] \int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}. In the above integral, the function \scriptstyle \sqrt{1-x^2} represents the top half of a circle (the square root is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem ), and the integral \scriptstyle \int_{-1}^1 is an operation which computes the area between that half a circle and the x axis. { Sine and } { cosine functions repeat with period 2. } The trigonometric function s rely on angles, and mathematicians generally use radians as units of measurement. plays an important role in angles measured in radians : A complete circle spans an angle of 2 radians. [ Ayers 1964 60 ] The angle measure of 180° is equal to radians, and 1° = ( /180) radians. Common trigonometric functions have periods that are multiples of, for example, sine and cosine have period 2. [ Bronshteĭn Semendiaev 1971 210–211 ] Thus, for any angle θ and any integer [ k ], \scriptstyle \sin\theta = \sin\left(\theta + 2\pi k \right) and \scriptstyle \cos\theta = \cos\left(\theta + 2\pi k \right).

Another Monte Carlo method for computing is to draw a circle inscribed in a square, and randomly place dots in the square. The ratio of dots inside the circle to the total number of dots will approximately equal \scriptstyle \pi/4. [ Arndt Haenel 2006 39–40 ] [ Posamentier Lehmann 2004 105 ] Monte Carlo methods for approximating are very slow compared to other methods, and are never used to approximate when speed or accuracy are desired.

In the polar coordinate system, one number (radius or r) is used to represent [ z ] &apos;s distance from the origin of the complex plane and the other (angle or φ) to represent a counter-clockwise rotation from the positive real line as follows: [ Ayers 1964 100 ] z = r\cdot(\cos\varphi + i\sin\varphi). where [ i ] is the imaginary unit satisfying [ i ] 2 = −1. The frequent appearance of in complex analysis can be related to the behavior of the exponential function of a complex variable, described by Euler&apos;s formula : [ Bronshteĭn Semendiaev 1971 592 ] e^{i\varphi} = \cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi where the constant e is the base of the natural logarithm. This formula establishes a correspondence between imaginary powers of [ e ] and points on the unit circle centered at the origin of the complex plane. Setting [ φ ] = in Euler&apos;s formula results in Euler&apos;s identity, celebrated by mathematicians because it contains the five most important mathematical constants: { Maor, Eli, E: The Story of a Number, Princeton University Press, 2009, p 160, ISBN 978-0-691-14134-3 ( &quot; five most important &quot; constants). } e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0.

When evaluated at \scriptstyle s = 2 it can be written as \zeta(2) = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdot \cdots Finding a simple solution for this infinite series was a famous problem in mathematics called the Basel problem. Leonhard Euler solved it in 1735 when he showed it was equal to \scriptstyle \frac{\pi^2}{6}. Euler&apos;s result leads to the number theory result that the probability of two random numbers being relatively prime (that is, having no shared factors) is equal to \scriptstyle 6/ \pi^2.

Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by this prime is \scriptstyle 1/p^2, and the probability that at least one of them is not is \scriptstyle 1-1/p^2. For distinct primes, these divisibility events are mutually independent, thus the probability that two numbers are relatively prime is given by a product over all primes: { Ogilvy, C.
