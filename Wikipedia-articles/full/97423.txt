As of 2010, the population was 77,076. The county seat is Searcy. White County is Arkansas&apos;s 31st county, formed on October 23, 1835, from portions of Independence, Jackson, and Pulaski counties and named for Hugh Lawson White, a Whig candidate for President of the United States. White County is part of the Little Rock Combined Statistical Area. It is an alcohol prohibition or dry county, though a few private establishments (such as the Searcy Country Club, and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts in Searcy and Beebe ) can sell alcohol. The 45th and current White County Judge is Michael Lincoln of Searcy, who assumed office in January 2007. [ Economy ] One of the state&apos;s largest banks, First Security Bank, was established in Searcy in 1932 as Security Bank. First Security now has over $3.2 billion in assets and 70 locations in Arkansas. Regional ice cream producer and distributor Yarnell Ice Cream Co. had its headquarters in the Searcy&apos;s downtown area. Latina Imports and Latina Nursery are also located in Searcy and is one of the largest female, Hispanic owned companies in Arkansas. [ History ] In 1958, Odell Pollard, a since retired attorney from Searcy, exposed corrupt election practices at Bald Knob, a small city in White County. Election workers cast &quot; absentee ballots &quot; for some thirty pipeline construction workers and their spouses. However, these workers were outside of Arkansas at the time of the election, which had a prohibition measure on the ballot. These voters never cast absentee votes, according to their affidavits presented by Pollard to the White County prosecutor. No action was taken until after the statute of limitations had expired, at which time the charges were rendered moot. Pollard said the fraud case cause him to switch his partisan affiliaton from Democrat to Republican. From 1966-1970, Pollard was the state party chairman, and from 1973-1976 was the Arkansas Republican National Committee man. { Statement of } { Odell Pollard, Searcy attorney, December 30, 2009 } In 1988, White County elected virtually an entire slate of Republicans to county offices. Though such Republican sweeps had frequently occurred in northern and northwestern Arkansas, White County was the first in the Little Rock area to turn to the GOP, as the party steadily made inroads toward a two-party system. { Osro Cobb, Osro Cobb of Arkansas: Memoirs of Historical Significance, Carol Griffee, ed.
