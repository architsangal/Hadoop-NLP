Robert Peck, [ PK598R2 Peck, Robert ] described by Blomfield in his history of Norfolk as a man with a &apos;violent schismatic spirit&apos; who led a movement within the church of St Andrews in nearby Hingham, Norfolk, in opposition to the established Anglicanism of the day. { &apos;&apos;The Nonconformist&apos;s Memorial: Being An Account of the Ministers, Who Were Ejected or Silenced After the Restoration&apos;&apos;, } { Samuel Palmer, London, 1775. } The Puritan Peck was eventually forced to flee to Hingham, Massachusetts, founded by many members of his parish, where he resided for several years, until King Charles I had been executed and Oliver Cromwell had taken the reins of government. { History of the Town of Hingham, Massachusetts, Thomas Tracy Bouve, 1893 } Robert Peck then elected to return to Hingham, Norfolk, and resumed as rector of St Andrews Church. He died in Hingham but left descendants in America, including his brother Joseph Peck, who settled in Rehoboth, Massachusetts. { &apos;&apos;A Genealogical History of the Descendants of Joseph Peck Who Emigrated with His Family to This Country in 1638&apos;&apos;, Ira Ballou Peck, 1868 } { &apos;&apos;Old Houses of the Antient Town of Norwich (Conn.), 1660 –1800&apos;&apos;, Mary Elizabeth Perkins, 1895 } In 1794, François-René de Chateaubriand, while in exile, taught here French language and literature.

Like the main body of the church, the tower is Perpendicular Gothic in style and is 97  ft tall. The interior of the church was badly damaged by fire in 1586. It has a 13th-century font. The tower is not attached to the church and at the wrong end of the church as the correct end would be too close to a large cliff. It was at this church in 1749 that the mother of Horatio Nelson, Catherine Suckling, married the Reverend Edmund Nelson (a former curate of Beccles). The Suffolk poet George Crabbe married Sarah Elmy at Beccles church in the 18th century. [ Transport ] Beccles Airport is located 2.3 miles (3.7  km) southeast of the town.

The reasons given for this scheme are to improve transport links to Ellough Industrial Estate and to facilitate regeneration of the market town of Beccles. [ Beccles Rail Loop ] [ Beccles Rail Loop Suffolk Network Rail £1-4 million 2012 2012 ] The proposed Beccles rail loop is designed to allow trains to pass each other on a previously singled section of rail track (between Lowestoft and Halesworth). The plan is to restore the disused island platform, and to relay track so that trains may pass each other, and this allowing for an hourly service on the East Suffolk line, instead of the current two-hourly one. It is planned to tie the works in with line resignalling. The station is also being adopted under a Network Rail scheme aiming to improve the station site. [ Schools ] Beccles is served by Sir John Leman High School (13-18) as well as two Middle Schools and a range of primary schools.
