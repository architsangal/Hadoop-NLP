It was the first publicly supported municipal library in the United States, the first large library open to the public in the United States, and the first public library to allow people to borrow books and other materials and take them home to read and use. The Boston Public Library is also the library of last recourse { Declared in 1970 by law. Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 78, Section 19C, paragraph 4 } of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; all adult residents of the commonwealth are entitled to borrowing and research privileges, and the library receives state funding. The Boston Public Library contains 8.9 million books and A/V (approximately 24 million items encompassing all formats), { An Overview: 2010 The Boston Public Library. January 19, 2010. } making it the second-largest public library in the United States, according to the American Library Association. { American Library Association, &quot; ALA Library Fact Sheet 22 – The Nation&apos;s Largest Libraries: A Listing by Volumes Held &quot;. July 2010. } In fiscal year 2009, the city of Boston spent 1% ($23,253,996) of its budget on the library – some $36 per person. { July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009; cf. } [ http://mblc.state.ma.us/advisory/statistics/public/repmunicpie/index.php FY 2009 Municipal Pie Report Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners 2011 2011-04-04 ] [ Overview ] According to its website, the collection of the Boston Public Library has grown to 6.1 million books, which makes it one of the largest municipal public library systems in the United States. According to the American Library Association, the circulation of the BPL is 15,458,022 which also makes it one of the busiest public library systems in the nation. Because of the strength and importance of its research collection, the Boston Public Library is a member of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), a not-for-profit organization comprising the research libraries of North America. The New York Public Library is the only other public library that is a member of the ARL. The library has special strengths in art and art history (available on the third floor of the McKim building) and American history (including significant research material), and maintains a depository of government documents. Included in the BPL&apos;s research collection are more than 1.7 million rare books and manuscripts. It possesses wide-ranging and important holdings, including medieval manuscripts and incunabula, early editions of William Shakespeare (among which are a number of Shakespeare quartos and the First Folio ), the George Ticknor collection of Spanish literature, a major collection of Daniel Defoe, records of colonial Boston, the 3,800 volume personal library of John Adams, the mathematical and astronomical library of Nathaniel Bowditch, important manuscript archives on abolitionism, including the papers of William Lloyd Garrison, and a major collection of materials on the Sacco and Vanzetti case. There are large collections of prints, photographs, postcards, and maps. The library, for example, holds one of the major collections of watercolors and drawings by Thomas Rowlandson. The library has a special strength in music, and holds the archives of the Handel and Haydn Society, scores from the estate of Serge Koussevitzky, and the papers of the important American composer Walter Piston. For all these reasons, the historian David McCullough has described the Boston Public Library as one of the five most important libraries in America, the others being the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the university libraries of Harvard and Yale. [ 2006 ], the Library has had staffing and funding levels for conservation below that of its peers: the BPL&apos;s staff of two full-time conservators is significantly less than the New York Public Library&apos;s thirty-five. Many colonial records and John Adams manuscripts are brittle, decaying, and in need of attention prompting the Library&apos;s acting Keeper of Rare Books and Manuscripts to say that &quot; they are falling apart. &quot; [ MacQuarrie Brian Library lacks means to repair old tomes The Boston Globe 2006-10-06 http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/10/06/library_lacks_means_to_repair_old_tomes?mode%3DPF 2006-10-06 ] [ October 2010 H3llBot ] The library is considering cutting some of its branches and staff.

George Ticknor, a Harvard professor and trustee of the Boston Athenaeum, raised the possibility of establishing a public library in Boston beginning as early as 1826. At the time, Ticknor could not generate enough interest. Portrait of George Ticknor In 1841, Alexandre Vattemare, a Frenchman, suggested that all of Boston&apos;s libraries combine themselves into one institution for the benefit of the public. { McCrann, Grace-Ellen (2005): &quot; Contemporary Forces That Supported the Founding of the Boston Public } { Library. &quot; Public Libraries, Vol. 44, no. 4, July/August 2005. } The idea was presented to many Boston libraries, however, most were uninterested in the idea. At Vattemare&apos;s urging, Paris sent gifts of books in 1843 and 1847 to assist in establishing a unified public library. Vattemare made yet another gift of books in 1849. Josiah Quincy, Jr. anonymously donated $5,000 to begin the funding of a new library. Quincy made the donation while he was mayor of Boston. Indirectly, John Jacob Astor also influenced the establishment of a public library in Boston. At the time of his death, Astor bequeathed $400,000 to New York to establish a public library there. Because of the cultural and economic rivalry between Boston and New York, this bequest prompted more discussion of establishing a public library in Boston. { McCrann, Grace-Ellen (2005): &quot; Contemporary Forces That Supported the Founding of the Boston Public Library. &quot; Public Libraries, Vol. 44, no. 4, July/August 2005. } In 1848, a statute of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts enabled the creation of the library. The library was officially established in Boston by a city ordinance in 1852. { For context, see: } { List of libraries in 19th-century Boston, Massachusetts } Eager to support the library, Edward Everett collected documents from both houses of Congress, bound them at his own expense, and offered this collection to help establish the new library. At the time of Everett&apos;s donation, George Ticknor became involved in the active planning for the new library. { McCrann 2005. } In 1852, financier Joshua Bates gave a gift of $50,000 to establish a library in Boston. After Bates&apos; gift was received, Ticknor made lists of what books to purchase. He traveled extensively to purchase books for the library, visit other libraries, and set up book agencies. Public Library, Boylston Street, 1858–1895 (demolished 1899). To house the collection, a former schoolhouse located on Mason Street was selected as the library&apos;s first home. On March 20, 1854, the Reading Room of the Boston Public Library officially opened to the public. The circulation department opened on May 2, 1854. &apos;&apos;&apos;Reading Room&apos;&apos;&apos; in 1871 at the first Boylston Street building, the library&apos;s location between 1858 and 1895. The opening day collection of 16,000 volumes fit in the Mason Street building, but it quickly became obvious that its quarters were inadequate. So in December 1854, the library&apos;s commissioners authorized the library to move to a new building on Boylston Street. Designed by Charles Kirk Kirby to hold 240,000 volumes, the imposing Italianate edifice opened in 1858. But eventually the library outgrew that building as well; in 1878, an examining committee recommended replacing it with a new one at another location. By 1880, the Massachusetts legislature authorized construction of an even grander library building. A site selected was in Back Bay on Copley Square – the prominent corner of Boylston Street and Dartmouth Street, opposite Richardson &apos;s Trinity Church and near the first Boston Museum of Fine Arts. After several years of debate over the selection of the architects and architectural style for the new library, in 1887 the prestigious New York firm of McKim, Mead, and White was chosen to design the new library. In 1888, Charles Follen McKim proposed a design based on Renaissance style which met approval from the trustees of the library, and construction commenced. McKim Building, Copley Square, Boston, 2005 [ Central Library ] [ The McKim building ] [ Boston Public Library, McKim Building ] The McKim building houses the BPL&apos;s research collection. [ The Johnson building ] Johnson Building, Boylston St. near Copley Square, Boston, 2008 Designed by Philip Johnson, a late modernist addition (which somewhat anticipated postmodernist architecture ) was built in 1967–1971 and opened in 1972. The Johnson building reflects similar proportions, and is built of the same pink Milford granite as the McKim building. Critics have likened it to a mausoleum, citing the small percentage of windows relieving the massive walls in its exterior façade. Upon opening, the Johnson building became the home for the BPL&apos;s main circulating collection, which includes works in many languages. It also serves as headquarters for the Boston Public Library&apos;s 25 branch libraries. [ Current services ] [ Internet access ] One of the features that the Boston Public Library offered first is free wireless internet. It is offered throughout the entire library and at all 25 branches, giving access to anyone who has a wireless enabled laptop and a library card to access the Internet. Plug-in Ethernet access is also available in Bates Hall. The Boston Public Library also maintains several Internet databases providing either catalogue or full-text access to different parts of its collections, as well as to a number of proprietary databases. Public Internet access is also available to those without laptops, though this is in high demand and will be limited in duration if there are other patrons waiting. [ Subscription databases ] The Boston Public Library purchases access for its patrons to databases owned by the following companies: [ http://www.bpl.org/electronic/alpha.asp Online Database A - Z List Boston Public Library Electronic Resources 13 April 2012 ] Gale (products include InfoTrac and MLA International Bibliography ) { EBSCO Industries } H.

Viewed as a means to extend its presence throughout the city, the branch system evolved from an idea in 1867 to a reality in 1870, when the first branch library in the United States was opened in East Boston. The library currently has 26 branches serving diverse populations in the city&apos;s neighborhoods. North End Branch, 25 Parmenter Street. A delivery station was first opened in 1882.
