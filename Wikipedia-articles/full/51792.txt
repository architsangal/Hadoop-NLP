Gosling, OC (born May 19, 1955 near Calgary, Alberta, Canada ) is a computer scientist, best known as the father of the Java programming language. [ Education and career ] In 1977, Gosling received a B.Sc in Computer Science from the University of Calgary. In 1983, he earned a Ph.D in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, and his doctoral thesis was titled &quot; Algebraic Constraints &quot;. His thesis advisor was Bob Sproull { http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alumni/advisor.html#G }. While working towards his doctorate, he wrote a version of Emacs ( gosmacs ), and before joining Sun Microsystems he built a multi-processor version of Unix { James Gosling mentioned a multiprocessor Unix in his statement during the } { US vs Microsoft Antitrust DOJ trial in 1998 } [ http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f2000/2049.htm DOJ/Antitrust Statement in MS Antitrust case US DOJ 2007-02 ] while at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as several compiler s and mail systems. Between 1984 and 2010, Gosling was with Sun Microsystems. He is known as the father of the Java programming language. On April 2, 2010, Gosling left Sun Microsystems which had recently been acquired by the Oracle Corporation. { Guevin, Jennifer. (2010-04-10) Java co-creator James Gosling leaves Oracle. News.cnet.com. Retrieved on 2012-02-21. } Regarding why he left, Gosling wrote on his blog that &quot; Just about anything I could say that would be accurate and honest would do more harm than good. &quot; He has since taken a very critical stance towards Oracle in interviews, noting that &quot; During the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle, where we were being grilled about the patent situation between Sun and Google, we could see the Oracle lawyer&apos;s eyes sparkle. &quot; { Shankland, Stephen.

Retrieved on 2012-02-21. } Later, during the Oracle vs. Google trial over Android, he clarified his position saying &quot; Just because Sun didn&apos;t have patent suits in our genetic code doesn&apos;t mean we didn&apos;t feel wronged. While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they are in the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really disturbed, even Jonathan: he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of folks at Sun. &quot; On March 28, 2011, James Gosling announced on his blog that he had been hired by Google. { Next Step on the Road. Nighthacks.com. Retrieved on 2012-02-21. } Five months later, he announced that he joined a startup called Liquid Robotics. { I&apos;ve moved again : On a New Road. Nighthacks.com.

A Commemorative Issue Ching-Chih Chang, Amy Hall, Jeanie Treichel Sun Microsystems, Inc. 2010-02-07 ] He created the original design of Java and implemented the language&apos;s original compiler and virtual machine. Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early 1980s graduate student days, when he created a pseudo-code (p-code) virtual machine for the lab&apos;s DEC VAX computer so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. Pascal compiled into p-code to foster precisely this kind of portability. In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely-distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine. { McMillan, William W. &quot; Java&apos;s ability to run on many different kinds of computers grew out of software devised decades before. &quot; IEEE Spectrum 48(7), July 2011 pp. 44-49, 58–59. } For his achievement he was elected to Foreign Associate member of the United States National Academy of Engineering. [ 2011 3 29 ] He has also made major contributions to several other software systems, such as NeWS and Gosling Emacs. He co-wrote the &quot; bundle &quot; program, a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike &apos;s book The Unix Programming Environment. [ Honors ] 2007: he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada.
