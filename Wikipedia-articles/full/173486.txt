Produced first by Saban Entertainment, later by BVS Entertainment, and currently by SCG Power Rangers LLC, the series took its initial premise and much of its footage from the Japanese tokusatsu Super Sentai franchise. Its first entry, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, debuted on August 28, 1993, and helped launch the Fox Kids programming block of the 1990s, during which it catapulted into popular culture along with a line of action figure s and other toys by Bandai. { Global Development } { 2010-02-07 } Despite initial criticism for its action violence targeted to child audiences, the franchise has continued, and [ 2011 on ] the show consists of 19 television seasons of 16 different series and two theatrical film s. Creator Haim Saban regained ownership of the franchise in 2010 after seven years under The Walt Disney Company. The current season Power Rangers Samurai debuted in the United States on February 7, 2011. [ Power Rangers SAMURAI http://www.powerrangers.com/seasons-samurai.html powerrangers.com September 22, 2010 ] [ Premise ] [ List of Power Rangers List of Power Rangers characters List of Power Rangers villains ] Since Power Rangers derives most of its footage from the &apos;&apos;Super Sentai&apos;&apos; Series, it features many hallmarks that distinguish it from other superhero series. Each series revolves around a team of young people recruited and trained by a mentor to morph into Rangers, able to utilize special powers and pilot colossal assault machines called Zords to defeat and overcome evil forces that threaten humanity. At the end of a series, Rangers sacrifice their weapons, Zords, or powers in order to defeat the lead villain they had fought during the series. For example in Mighty Morphin, alien wizard Zordon recruits &quot; teenagers with attitude &quot; to harness the power of the dinosaurs to overcome the forces of evil space alien Rita Repulsa. [ Day of the Dumpster Day of the Dumpster Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Fox 1993-08-28 1 1 ] When &quot; morphed &quot; rangers become powerful superhero es wearing color-coded skin-tight battle suits and helmets with opaque visor s. Each team&apos;s costumes are nearly identical aside from individual rangers&apos; color and helmet design. Morphed Rangers generally possesses superhuman strength, durability, and ability in hand-to-hand combat. Some possess superhuman abilities such as super-speed or invisibility, attributes somewhat related to their Ranger abilities. { Power Rangers Dino Thunder, } { Power Rangers S.P.D., } { Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, } { Power Rangers Jungle Fury } In addition, each individual ranger has a unique individual weapon as well as common weaponry used for ground fighting. { As the series progresses, one or more of the Rangers will usually receive } { motorcycle s for long-distance travel, as well as individual } { Zord s. In many series, a Ranger is also given additional Zords or weapons. In some cases, one Ranger may receive something that other Rangers may not have; an example of this is the } { Battlizer given to the Red Ranger of each series since } { Power Rangers in Space (up through } { Operation Overdrive ). } When enemies grow to incredible sizes, Rangers utilize individual Zord s that combine into a larger Megazord. Rangers teams operate in teams of five or three, with more Rangers joining the team part way into each season. Each team of Rangers, with a few exceptions, obeys a general set of conventions, outlined at the beginning of Mighty Morphin and implied by mentors throughout many of the other series: Power Rangers may not use their Ranger powers for personal gain or for escalating a fight (unless forced to do so), nor may the Power Rangers disclose their identities to the general public. { Public servants (rescue squad, police officers, etc.) appearing as Rangers disregarded this convention in } { Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, } { Power Rangers S.P.D., } { Power Rangers Operation Overdrive and } { Power Rangers RPM. } The penalty for disobeying these rules, at least in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, would be the loss of their power. As in Super Sentai, the color palette of each Power Rangers team changes every series. { An original Power Ranger, the } { Titanium Ranger, was created especially for Lightspeed Rescue to add a sixth Power Ranger to the series. } Only Red, Blue, and Yellow appear in every Ranger team. The most common color that does not appear every year is Pink, followed by Green, Black, and White. Other colors and designations also appear throughout the series. { Other color designations include } { metal lic colors, violet, and &quot; Shadow &quot;, as well as protagonists who have powers and costumes similar to those of the Rangers but are not called &quot; Power Rangers &quot;, such as the } { Blue Senturion and } { Koragg the Knight Wolf. } A Rangers&apos; color designation also influences their wardrobe throughout the series: civilian clothing often matches Ranger color. { A joke highlighted this correlation in Dino Thunder when } { Tommy Oliver (a former Green Ranger, White Ranger, and Red Ranger) became the new Black Ranger; he said that he had to go shopping because he did not own enough black-colored clothing. } [ History ] [ Adapting the Super Sentai series ] [ October 2009 ] Production of Power Rangers episodes involves extensive localization of and revision of original Super Sentai source material in order to incorporate American culture and conform to American television standards. Rather than making an English dub or translation of the Japanese footage, Power Rangers programs consist of scenes featuring English-speaking actors (either from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom ) spliced with scenes featuring either Japanese actors dubbed into English or the action scenes from the Super Sentai Series featuring the Rangers fighting monsters or the giant robot ( Zord and Megazord) battles with English dubbing. In some series, original fight scenes are filmed to incorporate characters or items unique to the Power Rangers production. Like many of Saban Entertainment &apos;s previous ventures in localizing Japanese television for a Western audience, the plot, character names, and other names usually differ greatly from the source footage, though a few seasons have stayed close to the story of the original Super Sentai season. The series that began the franchise, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (an American adaptation of the 1992 Japanese Super Sentai Series, Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger ), began broadcasting as part of the Fox Kids block of programing that aired on the Fox network. It lasted for three seasons (from 1993 to 1996).
