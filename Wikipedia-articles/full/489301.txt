Read, London, Digitized by Google Books } The recipe explained the use of calf&apos;s intestines in the recipe, which was similar to black pudding (the intestines were stuffed) with the comment that &quot; these sort of... puddings must be made in summer, when hogs are seldom killed. &quot; { &apos;&apos;The Lady&apos;s Companuion&apos;&apos; p. 310 – Chitterlings } This recipe was repeated by the English cookery writer Hannah Glasse in her 1784 cookery book Art of Cookery. { Hannah Glasse (1784) &apos;&apos;The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy&apos;&apos; } [ Distribution, different traditions ] As pigs are a common source of meat throughout the world, the dish known as chitterlings can be found in most pork-eating cultures.
