She was named after Mount Haguro in Yamagata Prefecture. The other ships of her class were &apos;&apos;Myōkō&apos;&apos; (妙高), &apos;&apos;Nachi&apos;&apos; (那智), and &apos;&apos;Ashigara&apos;&apos; (足柄). The ships of this class displaced 13,300 tons, were 201  m (661  ft) long, and were capable of 36  kt (67  km/h). They carried two aircraft and their main armament was ten 203  mm (8  in) guns in five twin turrets. At the time they were built, this was the heaviest armament of any cruiser class in the world. [ Service history ] Haguro was laid down at the Mitsubishi shipyard in Nagasaki on March 16, 1925, launched and named on March 24, 1928, and was commissioned into the Imperial Navy on April 25, 1929. Her service in World War II started in the Dutch East Indies, where she engaged the enemy off Makassar on February 8, 1942.She played a key role in the battle of the Java Sea on February 27, 1942, and was involved in the sinking of [ Exeter 68 6 ] and the Dutch flag ship Hr Ms De Ruyter, and of [ Encounter H10 2 ] in another action off south Borneo on March 1, 1942. On May 7, 1942 she participated in the battle of the Coral Sea, moving on to the Solomon Islands where she took part in the battle of the Eastern Solomons on August 24, 1942, the evacuation from Guadalcanal at the end of January 1943, and took light damage in the battle of Empress Augusta Bay on November 2, 1943. On June 19, 1944 she survived the battle of the Philippine Sea, and on October 23–25, 1944 she took light damage in the battle of Leyte Gulf. [ Fate ] In May 1945, Haguro was the target of the British &quot; Operation Dukedom &quot; and was ambushed. The 26th Destroyer Flotilla found her with the destroyer &apos;&apos;Kamikaze&apos;&apos; just after midnight on May 16, 1945, and began the attack. During the battle, the Kamikaze was lightly damaged, but Haguro was hit by gunfire and three Mark IX Torpedoes. The Haguro soon began to slow down and took a 30-degrees list to port. At 2:32 AM the Haguro began to go down stern first in the Malacca Strait, [ 55 mi km ] off Penang; Kamikaze rescued 320 survivors. [ July 2011 ] Nine hundred men, [ July 2011 ] including Vice Admiral Hashimoto and Rear Admiral Sugiura, perished with her. Rear Admiral Sugiura was later promoted to Vice Admiral posthumously on May 16. The battle was the last gun action ever fought between surface ships. Haguro was stricken from the navy list on June 20, 1945. The wreck was discovered in 2003, showing significant superstructure damage from her last and earlier battles. { Rabaul on November 2, 1943, showing damage received in the } { battle of Empress Augusta Bay that morning. } { USAAF gun camera footage of the &apos;&apos;Haguro&apos;&apos; under attack at } { Rabaul } [ Notes ] [ References ] [ Books ] [ Winton John 1979 Sink the Haguro!
