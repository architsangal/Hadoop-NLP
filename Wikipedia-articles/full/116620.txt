In the mid-18th century, tens of thousands of European settlers and pioneer families with their wagons followed the same route on the Great Wagon Road from Pennsylvania to Virginia and points south and west. In 1744, a ferry was established at the present site of Williamsport to carry the traffic across the Potomac River. Today’s travelers make the crossing on Interstate 81 a mile downriver from the town. The actual land of present day Williamsport was owned by American Revolutionary War Otho Holland Williams, of which the town was named. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal opened in the area of 1834. Williamsport became a very popular waterfront town which benefited the economy. But then after a large flood the canals were shut down for good in 1924. The overflowing flooding waters of the River prevented General Robert E. Lee &apos;s army, on its retreat from Gettysburg, from crossing and making it safely into Virginia for several days. The town&apos;s historic core was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Williamsport Historic District in 2001. [ 2008a ] The town in May 2010 secured Michael Sparks, a previous town consultant and writer of a revitalization feasibility study, as Director of Economic and Community Development to revitalize downtown and attract tourism. { Williamsport Budget, Andrew Schotz June 14, 2010. } { http://www.williamsportmd.gov/docs/minutes/minutes030110.pdf } Mr. Sparks outlined a revitalization initiative with the acronym of C.A.R.E.
