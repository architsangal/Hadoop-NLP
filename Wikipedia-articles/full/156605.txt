Hill and was developed from the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad. The Great Northern&apos;s route was the northernmost transcontinental railroad route in the United States. It was completed on January 6, 1893, at Scenic, Washington. The Great Northern was the only privately funded, and successfully built, transcontinental railroad in United States history. No federal land grants were used during its construction, unlike every other transcontinental railroad built. It was one of the few transcontinental railroads to avoid receivership following the Panic of 1893. The Great Northern Railway also fell victim to the deadliest avalanche in United States history, at the site of the now non-existent town of Wellington, Washington (later renamed, due to the disaster, to Tye, Washington ). At the end of 1967 GN operated 8282 route-miles, not including class II subsidiaries MA &amp; CR (3 miles) and PC (32 miles). [ History ] The Great Northern was built in stages, slowly to create profitable lines, before extending the road further into the undeveloped Western territories. In a series of the earliest public relations campaigns, contests were held to promote interest in the railroad and the ranchlands along its route. Fred J. Adams used promotional incentives such as feed and seed donations to farmers getting started along the line. Contests were all-inclusive, from largest farm animals to largest freight carload capacity and were promoted heavily to immigrants &amp; newcomers from the East. The earliest predecessor railroad to the GN was the St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad, a bankrupt railroad with a small amount of track in the state of Minnesota. Hill convinced John S. Kennedy (a New York City banker), Norman Kittson (Hill&apos;s friend and a wealthy fur trader), Donald Smith (a Montreal banker and executive with the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company ), George Stephen (Smith&apos;s cousin and a wealthy railroad executive), and others to invest $5.5 million in purchasing the railroad. { Malone, p. 38-41. } On March 13, 1878, the road&apos;s creditors formally signed an agreement transferring their bonds and control of the railroad to Hill&apos;s investment group. { Malone. p. 49. } On September 18, 1889, Hill changed the name of the Minneapolis and St. Cloud Railway (a railroad which existed primarily on paper, but which held very extensive land grants throughout the Midwest and Pacific Northwest) to the Great Northern Railway. { Yenne, p. 23. } On February 1, 1890, he transferred ownership of the StPM &amp; M, Montana Central Railway, and other rail systems he owned to the Great Northern. The Great Northern had branches that ran north to the Canadian border in Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. It also had branches that ran to Superior, Wisconsin, and Butte, Montana, connecting with the iron mining fields of Minnesota and copper mines of Montana. At its height Great Northern operated over 8,000 miles.

The Stone Arch Bridge stands in Minneapolis, near the Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall on the Mississippi. The bridge ceased to be used as a railroad bridge in 1978 and is now used as a pedestrian river crossing with excellent views of the falls and of the lock system used to grant barges access up the river past the falls. The mainline headed northwest from the Twin Cities, across North Dakota and eastern Montana. The line then crossed the Rocky Mountains at Marias Pass, and then followed the Flathead River and then Kootenai River to Athol, Idaho and Spokane, Washington. From here, the mainline crossed the Cascade Mountains through the Cascade Tunnel under Stevens Pass, reaching Seattle, Washington in 1893, with the driving of the last spike at Scenic, Washington, on January 6, 1893. A 1909 ad aimed at settlers from a St. Paul Newspaper (publication name unknown). The Great Northern mainline crossed the continental divide through Marias Pass, the lowest crossing of the Rockies south of the Canadian border. Here, the rails enter Glacier National Park, which the GN promoted heavily as a tourist attraction. GN constructed stations at East Glacier and West Glacier entries to the park, stone and timber lodges at the entries and other inns &amp; lodges throughout the Park. Many of the structures have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places due to unique construction, location and the beauty of the surrounding regions. In 1931 the GN also developed the &quot; Inside Gateway, &quot; a route to California that rivaled the Southern Pacific Railroad &apos;s route between Oregon and California. The GN route was further in-land than the SP route and ran south from the Columbia River in Oregon. The GN connected with the Western Pacific at Bieber, California; the Western Pacific connected with the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe in Stockton, California, and together the three railroads (GN, WP, and ATSF) competed with Southern Pacific for traffic between California and the Pacific Northwest. With a terminus at Superior, Wisconsin, the Great Northern was able to provide transportation from the Pacific to the Atlantic by taking advantage of the shorter distance to Duluth from the ocean, as compared to Chicago. In 1970 the Great Northern, together with the Northern Pacific Railway, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway merged to form the Burlington Northern Railroad. The BN operated until 1996, when it merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway. The Great Northern Railway is considered to have inspired (in broad outline, not in specific details) the Taggart Transcontinental railroad in Ayn Rand &apos;s Atlas Shrugged. { Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff, Peter Schwartz, The voice of reason: essays in objectivist thought (New American Library, 1989), pg. 92 } [ Passenger service ] { Minneapolis, Minnesota, which also served the } { Northern Pacific Railway. This historic depot was razed in 1978. } { Minot, North Dakota in 1914. } The Great Northern operated various passenger trains but the Empire Builder was the GN&apos;s premier passenger train. The Empire Builder was named in honor of Great Northern&apos;s founder James J. Hill, who was known as the &quot; Empire Builder. &quot; [ Named trains ] [ http://www.gnflyer.com/GlacierP.html Glacier Park Limited Ted&apos;s Great Northern Homepage 6 March 2012 ] [ http://www.gnflyer.com/Express.html Great Northern Express Ted&apos;s Great Northern Homepage 6 March 2012 ] [ http://www.gnflyer.com/Transcon2.html Transcontinental Trains Ted&apos;s Great Northern Homepage 6 March 2012 ] [ http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AGreat_Northern_daily_trains_circa_1912.jpg Three Daily Trains circa 1912 Great Northern Railway 6 March 2012 ] Alexandrian : St. Paul–Fargo - (1931– Badger Express : St. Paul-Superior/Duluth (later renamed Badger) Cascadian : Seattle - Spokane (1909-1959) Dakotan : St. Paul-Minot Eastern Express Seattle-St. Paul (1903-1906) (replaced by Fast Mail in 1906) Fast Mail No.27: St. Paul–Seattle (1906-1910) (renamed The Oregonian in 1910) Glacier Park Limited: St. Paul–Seattle (1915-1929) (replaced by Oriental Limited in 1929) Gopher : St. Paul-Superior/Duluth Great Northern Express: (1909-1918) Kansas City-Seattle International : Seattle-Vancouver, B.C.
