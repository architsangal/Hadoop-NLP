Its specific epithet is Latin for &quot; dark &quot; or &quot; dim &quot;. It is very closely genetically related to the Pacific white-sided dolphin, but current scientific consensus is that they are distinct species. The dolphin&apos;s range is patchy with major populations around South America, southwestern Africa, New Zealand and various oceanic islands with some sightings around southern Australia and Tasmania. The dusky dolphin prefers cool currents and inshore waters but can also be found offshore. It feeds on a variety of fish and squid species and has flexible hunting tactics. The dusky dolphin is known for its remarkable acrobatics, having a number of aerial behaviors. The status of the dolphin is unknown but it has been commonly caught in gill nets. [ Taxonomy ] Dusky dolphin drawings in &apos;&apos;Plate 5&apos;&apos; of &apos;&apos;Mammalogy&apos;&apos; section in &apos;&apos;Mammalogy and Ornithology&apos;&apos; (1858) It is commonly thought that the dusky dolphin was first described by John Edward Gray in 1828 from stuffed skin and a single skull shipped from the Cape of Good Hope to the British Museum. Gray first described the species as Delphinus obscurus, with the subgenus Grampus in his 1828 Specilegia Zoologica. Gray reported that the animal was captured around the Cape of Good Hope by a Captain Haviside (often misspelt &quot; Heaviside &quot; ) and sent to the British Museum though the Royal College of Surgeons in 1827. [ Ridgway, Sam H.

[ Gray J. E. 1846 On the British Cetacea The Annuals and Magazine of Natural History London 17 82–5 ] Gray classified D. supercilious as a junior synonym of his D. obscurus and credited Lesson and Garnot (1826) for their original description. Meanwhile, Charles Darwin also described what turned out to be this species as Delphinus fitzroyi from a specimen harpooned off Argentina in 1838. The dusky dolphin was reclassified as Prodelphinus obscurus in 1885 by British naturalist William Henry Flower, [ Flower, W. H. 1885 List of the specimens of Cetacea in the Zoological Department of the British Museum British Museum London 28–29 http://www.archive.org/stream/listofspecimenso00brituoft#page%2F28%2Fmode%2F2up%2Fsearch%2Fobscurus ] before gaining its current binomial name, Lagenorhynchus obscurus, from American biologist Frederick W. True in 1889.

Some researchers have suggested that they are the same species but morphological and life history evidence shows otherwise. The two sister species diverged at around 1.9–3.0  million years ago.

If this placement is accurate, a new genus name will need to be coined to accommodate these two species. { May-Collado, L., Agnarsson, I. (2006) &quot; Cytochrome b and Bayesian inference of whale phylogeny &quot;, Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 38(2):344-54. } Dusky dolphins from Argentina and southwest Africa separated 2000 generations ago from an ancestral Atlantic population and subsequently diverged without much gene flow. Most populations have low genetic diversity, with the Peruvian population being an expectation. Possible hybrids of dusky dolphins have been described with a long-beaked common dolphin [ Reyes Julio C.

There is significant variation in size among the different population areas. The largest dusky dolphins have been encountered off the coast of Peru, where they are up to 210  cm (6  feet) in length and 100  kg (210 pounds) in mass. The size for dusky dolphins in New Zealand have been recorded to be a length range of 167–178  cm and a weight range of 69–78  kg for females and a length range of 165–175  cm and a weigh range of 70–85  kg for males. [ Cipriano F. W. 1992 Behavior and occurrence patterns, feeding ecology, and life history of dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) off Kaikoura, New Zealand Phd. Thesis University of Arizona ] There is almost no sexual dimorphism in this species, although males have more curved dorsal fins with broader bases and greater surface areas. The back of the dolphin is dark grey or black, and the dorsal fin is distinctively two-toned—the leading edge matches the back in color, but the trailing edge is a much lighter greyish white. Dusky dolphins have a long, light grey patch on their foreside leading to a short, dark grey beak. The throat and belly are white, { Webber, M.C. 1987. &quot; A comparison of dusky and Pacific white-sided dolphins (genus. Lagenorhynchus): morphology and distribution &quot;. M.S. Thesis, San Francisco State University, San Francisco CA. 102 pp. } and the beak and lower jaw are dark grey. There are two blazes of white color running back on the body from the dorsal fin to the tail. Right between the white areas remains a characteristic thorn-shaped patch of dark colour, by which the species can easily be recognized. Aside from that, dusky dolphins may be confused with other members of their genus when observed at sea.It can be distinguished from the common dolphin s, which have a more prominent and longer beak and yellow flank markings.

The dolphins can be found off the coasts of South America, southwestern Africa, southern Australia and Tasmania, New Zealand and some oceanic islands. Off South America, dusky dolphins range from southern Peru to Cape Horn in the west and from southern Patagonia to around 36º S in the east. { Waerebeek, K.

In comparison, they are uncommon in the Beagle Channel and the inshore waters of the Tierra del Fuego region.

The dolphin population in this area centers around East Cape and Cape Palliser on the North Island to Timaru and Oamaru on the South Island. { Gaskin, D E. (1972) &quot; Whales dolphins and seals with special reference to the New Zealand region &quot;. Heinemann Educational Books Ltd. } They are especially common in the cold waters of the Southland and Canterbury currents. In Africa, the dusky dolphin ranges from Lobito Bay, Angola in the north to False Bay, South Africa in the south. Within Australian waters, dusky dolphins have been recorded in colder waters off Kangaroo Island, eastern Tasmania and Bass Strait, although they are uncommon and those that are sighted there are possibly transients from New Zealand.

[ Ecology and behavior ] { Kaikoura, New Zealand } Dusky dolphins prefer cool, upwelling waters as well as cold currents. They largely live in inshore waters and can be found up to the outer continental shelf and in similar zones in offshore islands. Dusky dolphins can move over great distances (around 780  km) but have no well defined seasonal migrations. However, dolphins off Argentina and New Zealand make inshore and offshore seasonal and diurnal movements. In Argentina, dusky dolphins associate closely with southern right whale s and South American sea lion s. They have been found around bottlenose dolphin s but apparently do not interact with them; and may share feeding areas with Risso&apos;s dolphin s. They also associate with various seabirds like kelp gull s, cormorant s, tern s, shearwater s, petrel s and albatross es. In New Zealand, dusky dolphins mingle with common dolphins. Dusky dolphins have also been observed with southern right whale dolphin s and pilot whale s off southwestern Africa. { Cruickshank, R.A. &amp; S.G. Brown (1981) &quot; Recent observations and some historical records of southern right-whale dolphins Lissodelphis peronii &quot;, South African Fishery Bulletin, 15(1):109–21. Abstract } [ Vocalizations and echolocation ] In general, three different types of sounds are produced by dolphins (and other toothed whales ). These are click trains, which are made of numerous individual clicks, usually broadband signals that change from low value to high value quickly, { Caldwell, M.C; Caldwell D.K (1971) &quot; Underwater pulsed sounds produced by captive spotted dolphins, Stenella plagiodon &quot;, Cetology 1:1–7. } burst pulses, which are individual clicks with high repetition and can be heard by humans only as a buzzing sound and whistles, which are signal that are pure-tone, whose frequency varies depending on the time. Dusky dolphins produce all three sounds but most commonly make burst pulses. { SE Yin (1999) &quot; Movement patterns, behaviors, and whistle sounds of dolphin groups off Kaikoura, New Zealand &quot;, A Thesis, Texas A &amp; M University, College Station, TX. } Whistling is more common when dusky dolphins mingled with other dolphin species like common dolphin s. { Au, W.W.L.; Lammer, M.O; Yin, S. &quot; Acoustics of Dusky Dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) &quot;. Pp. 75–98 in: Würsig, B., and Würsig, M., editors. The Dusky Dolphin: Master Acrobat off Different Shores. Academic Press. (2010) ISBN 0-12-373723-0 } [ 79 ] The echolocation signals produced by dusky dolphins are broadband and of short duration, much like those other whistle-producing toothed whales. [ 95 ] They tend to have bi-modal frequency spectra which peak between 40 and 50  kHz at low-frequency and between 80 and 110  kHz at high-frequency. [ Au WW Würsig B Echolocation signals of dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) in Kaikoura, New Zealand. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 115 5 Pt 1 2307–13 2004 15139642 10.1121/1.1690082 ] The species&apos; echolocation signals are about 9–12   dB lower than for the larger white-beaked dolphin. [ Foraging and predation ] Dusky dolphins Dusky dolphins prey consume a variety of fish and squid species. Common fish species eaten include anchovies, lantern fish, pilchard s, sculpin s, hake s, horse mackerel, hoki and red cod. They are generally coordinate hunters. These dolphins have very flexible foraging strategies that can change depending on the environment. [ Benoit-Bird, K.J.; Würsig, B.; McFadden, C.J. 2004 Dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) foraging in two different habitats: active acoustic detection of dolphins and their prey Marine Mammal Science 20 2 215–31 10.1111/j.1748-7692.2004.tb01152.x http://people.oregonstate.edu/~benoitbk/reprints/dusky%20foraging%20mms.pdf ] In certain parts of New Zealand, were deep oceanic waters meet the shore, dusky dolphins forage in deep scattering layer s at night. They arrive at the hunting site individually but form groups when in the layer. The dolphins use their echolocation to detect and isolate an individual prey. Groups of foraging dolphins tend to increase when the layer is near the surface and decrease when it descends. When hunting in shallower waters in New Zealand and Argentina, dusky dolphins tend to forage during the day. The dolphins chase schools of fish or squid and herd them into stationary balls. { McFadden, C. J. (2003). &quot; Behavioral flexibility of feeding dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand. &quot; M.Sc. thesis, Texas A &amp; M University, College Station, TX. } They may control the school with light reflected from their white bellies.

Kastelein Plenum Press 0-306-43695-7 ] Dolphins herd prey against the surface but also horizontally against the shore, a point of land or the hull of a boat. During these times, it is believed that dusky dolphins increase prey availability for other predators including other dolphins, seabird s, shark s and pinniped s. In Argentina, dusky dolphins may use bird aggregations to coordinate foraging efforts. On the other hand, pinnipeds and sharks take advantage of the dolphin hunts which leaves almost no advantage to the dolphins. { Markowitz, T.M. (2004). &quot; Social organization of the New Zealand dusky dolphin &quot;. Ph.D. dissertation, Texas A &amp; M University, College Station. } Dusky dolphins are themselves preyed on by killer whale s and large sharks. Dolphins avoid killer whales by swimming into shallower water. { Würsig, B.; Würsig, M. (1980) &quot; Behavior and ecology of the dusky dolphin, Lagenorhynchus obscurus, in the South Atlantic &quot;. Fishery Bulletin 77: 871–90. } Dusky dolphins are also susceptible to parasitism by certain nematode, cestode and trematode species, mostly Nasitrema sp., Anisakis sp., Phyllobothrium delphini, Braunina cordiformis and Pholeter gasterophilus. { Van Waerebeek K, Reyes JC, Alfaro J (1993) &quot; Helminth parasites and phoronts of dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus (Gray, 1828) from Peru &quot;. Aquat Mamm 19(3):159–69. } [ Social behavior and reproduction ] Dusky dolphins live in a fission-fusion society with most group size increases occurring during foraging and decreases in group sizes occurring during resting and traveling. In the Golfo San José off the Valdes Peninsula, dolphins commonly switch between small traveling groups and large socio-sexual groups and encounter a variety of associates. Studies of dolphins off Kaikoura, New Zealand show that dolphins normally live in large groups that split into smaller sub-groups. These sub-groups are composed of mating adults (mating groups), mothers with calves (nursery groups) and non-breeding adults. Dusky dolphins have a promiscuous mating system in which both males and females mate with multiple partners. Mating groups are generally made of around ten males and a single female. These mating groups can be found in both shallow and deep water but more often gather near shore. { Markowitz, T.M.; Markowitz, W.J.; and Morton, L.M. &quot; Mating habits of New Zealand dusky dolphins &quot;. Pp. 151–76 in: Würsig, B., and Würsig, M., editors. The Dusky Dolphin: Master Acrobat off Different Shores. Academic Press. (2010) ISBN 0-12-373723-0. } [ 162 ] Two dolphins jumping In the mating groups, the males pursue the female in high speed chases. Females seem to prefer males with great speed and agility rather than size, strength or aggression. [ 164 ] [ 175 ] Females may extend the chase as long as possible so only the best male remains. { Whitehead, H.; and Mann, J. (2000). &quot; Female reproductive strategies of cetaceans &quot;. In Cetacean Societies. Mann, J., editior. University of Chicago Press, pp. 219–246. ISBN 0-226-50341-0 } Females may try to evade males that are not vigorous or lack social skill. [ 170 ] It is also possible that males may form alliances to catch females. [ 167–69 ] Unlike male bottlenose dolphin s, male dusky dolphins can&apos;t monopolize females. [ 166 ] The time when female dusky dolphins first reproduce varies between regions. New Zealand dolphins first reproduce at about 7–8 years with possibly 6–7 years for Argentine dolphins. A study of dusky dolphins off the coast of Peru showed that the reproductive cycle lasts around 28.6 months with mother dolphins becoming pregnant for 12.9 months, lactate for a further 12 months and rest for 3.7 months before the cycle begins again. During copulation, females tend to be on the top. [ 170 ] As with all species where females mate with multiple partners, male dusky dolphins have large testicles for sperm competition. [ 166 ] Dusky dolphins sometimes engage in sexual behavior for reasons other than reproduction, perhaps for greeting, communication or strengthening social bonds. Homosexual behavior between males has been observed. Dolphins having sex for social reasons tend to be more relaxed. [ 175 ] Females with calves tend to gather in nursery groups in shallow water. Nursery groups likely provide give mothers and calves more time to rest, whuch is important for both. While the behaviors of nursery groups vary by month, resting is the predominant behavior during most months. { Weir, J.; Deutsch, S.; and Pearson, H.C. &quot; Dusky Dolphin Calf Rearing &quot;. Pp. 177–94 in: Würsig, B.; and Würsig, M., editors. The Dusky Dolphin: Master Acrobat off Different Shores. Academic Press. (2010) ISBN 0-12-373723-0. } [ 188 ] The formation of nursery groups in shallow waters also allow members to hunt prey species that inhabit in these waters. Both adults and calves have been observed to chase and catch fish and the adults may be teaching the calves how to hunt. [ 188-89 ] In contrast to shallower waters, hunting in deep water at night may be too dangerous for calves. [ 189 ] Calves are particularly vulnerable to predators like killer whales and use of shallow water by nursery groups may be a way to avoid predation. [ 183 ] Nursery groups tend to avoid mating groups. [ 174 ] Adult males in these groups will aggressively herd and chase females. They can separate calves from their mothers and harass them as well. [ 185 ] Calves may also become even more vulnerable to predators as they become exhausted and disorientated. [ 185 ] Mother dolphins may look after calves that are not their own. [ 192 ] Dusky dolphin performing a flip [ Aerial behavior ] Dusky dolphins perform a number of aerial displays. Displays include leaps, backslaps, headslaps, tailslaps, spins and noseouts. The dolphins also perform head-over-tail leaps which is has been called the most &quot; acrobatic &quot; of the displays. A headfirst re-entry is performed when a dolphin leaps entirely water and positions its back in a curve while it flips the tail to land back in the water head-first. &quot; Humping &quot; is similar except the snout and tail remain in the water when the dolphin is the arch. Leaps, head-over-tail leaps, backslaps, headslaps, tailslaps and spins are often done over and over again. Young dusky dolphins apparently are not born with the ability to perform the leaps and must learn to master each one. [ 190 ] Calves appear to learn the leaps in the following order: noisy leaps, head first re-entries, coordinated leaps and acrobatic leaps. [ 190–91 ] Adult dusky dolphins may perform different leaps in different contexts and calves may independently learn how to perform leaps but learn when to perform these when interacting others. [ 191 ] [ Relationship with humans ] { dolphinarium. Dusky dolphins normally do not do well in captivity. } [ Status ] The dusky dolphin is protected in much of its range. Dusky dolphins are listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN because; &quot;... assessment of global population status is not possible with the currently available estimates of abundance and removals. The subpopulation off Peru has probably been overexploited but present data do not allow estimation of present decline &quot;. Dusky dolphins may fall victim to the small cetacean fisheries of Peru and Chile. The expansion of these fisheries could have started in Peru when the anchoveta fishery collapsed in 1972. Dolphins have also been caught in gill nets in New Zealand, however catches appear to have dropped since the 1970s and 1980s. The dolphins are also thought to have been harpooned off South Africa, but the numbers are not considered large. The Dusky dolphin is listed on Appendix II { &quot; Appendix II &quot; of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5th March 2009. } of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( CMS ). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. A pair of dusky dolphins swimming alongside a boat [ Mussel farming ] The effect of mussel farming on dusky dolphins has been studied in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand. [ Markowitz Tim M. Harlin April D. Würsig Bernd McFadden Cynthia J. Dusky dolphin foraging habitat: overlap with aquaculture in New Zealand Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems 14 133–49 2004 10.1002/aqc.602 ] Dusky dolphins are commonly seem in this area which is also the place with the greatest density of proposed farming activity. It appears that dolphins rarely enter existing farms and when they do, they usually swim quickly up the lanes and between rows of lines and floats. [ Tourism ] { South Island } Dusky dolphins are popular attractions for whale-watching tours. Since 1997, dolphin watching activities have increased in Patagonia, with dusky dolphins (along with Commerson&apos;s dolphin s ) as the target species. { Coscarella, M. A, Dans, S. L, Crespo, E. A, Pedraza, S. N. (2003) &quot; Potential impact of unregulated dolphin watching activities in Patagonia &quot;. J Cetacean Res Manag 5: 77–84. Abstract } Tourists interested in see dusky dolphins grew from 1,393 in 1997 to 1,840 in 2000. Encounters with dolphins increased from 25% during 1999 to 90% in 2001. Dolphin watching in this areas started as an alternative to whale watching, which was mostly based on that of the southern right whale. Dusky dolphin watching is also popular in New Zealand, whose dolphin watching industry begin in the late 1980s, as a side attraction to sperm whale watching. Whale and dolphin watching tours have grown with around 75 permitted dolphin tour operators. [ 235 ] New Zealand has several locations to view and swim with dusky dolphins, notably in Marlborough Sounds. { Markowitz, T.M.; Dans, S.L.; Crespo, E.A.; Lundquist, D.L.; and Duprey, N.M.T. &quot; Human interactions with dusky dolphins: harvest, fisheries, habitat alteration, and tourism &quot;.

(2010) ISBN 0-12-373723-0. } [ 236 ] While dusky dolphin tourism is a larger industry in New Zealand than it is in Argentina, the effects of tourism on the dolphins seem to be lower in the former than the latter. [ 241 ] New Zealand tours are operated under permits are limited in number and have conditions and guidelines related to approach procedures and swim operations. [ 241 ] By contrast, there is no direct regulation of dolphin watching in Argentina. As such, dolphin activities are often disturbed by touring vessels.
