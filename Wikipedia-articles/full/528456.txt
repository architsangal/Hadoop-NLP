[ 2009 8 31 1925 1 2 ] { Quezon City, } { Philippines } Eraño de Guzman Manalo (January 2, 1925 - August 31, 2009 { Iglesia ni Cristo Head Dies - from the Philippine Daily Inquirer } ), also known as Ka Erdy, { &quot; ka &quot; as used by INC members is a short form of the word kapatid(Tagalog: brethren). &quot; ka &quot; is also sometimes used as a shortened form of kasama(Tagalog: comrade). } was the second Executive Minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo, serving from 1963 until 2009. He took over the administration of the church after the death of his father, Felix Manalo, in 1963. He was instrumental in the propagation and expansion of the church internationally. He previously held office as the General Treasurer of the church, and as a District Minister of Manila. { Villanueva, p. 6 } [ Biography ] Eraño Manalo was the fifth child of Felix Y. Manalo and Honorata de Guzman. His name came from a reversal and elision of the term &quot; New Era, &quot; which his father used to describe what he felt was &quot; a new Christian era &quot; as the Iglesia ni Cristo was established. His older siblings were Sisters Pilar and Avelina, and Brothers Dominador and Salvador. His youngest sibling is Brother Bienvenido. Eraño received his elementary education at St. John&apos;s Academy in San Juan, Metro Manila, starting at the age of six. Manalo initially took up law school, but left his studies to become a minister of the INC. He started attending the church&apos;s ministerial classes at the age of 16 and was ordained as a minister on 10 May 1947, at the age of 22. He held various positions in the church including being the general treasurer of the INC and circulation manager of the Pasugo magazine (now known as God&apos;s Message). During this time, he wrote a 64-page booklet entitled Christ-God: Investigated-False. On January 17, 1955, Eraño Manalo married Cristina Villanueva with whom he has six children ( Eduardo, Felix Nathaniel, Marco Erano, Lolita, Erlinda and Liberty). On 18 February 1953, ten years before his father&apos;s death, Eraño Manalo was elected successor to his father as Executive Minister. Following Eraño&apos;s death, his son Eduardo then assumed the role of INC&apos;s Executive Minister. { No shifts seen when Ka Erdie&apos;s son takes over INC -- ABSCBNNews.com } [ Administration ] With the passing of Felix Manalo on 12 April 1963, critics of the church predicted the decline and eventual fall of the Iglesia. To them, the church&apos;s popularity was due mainly to the charisma and leadership of Felix Manalo. Barely a month after assuming his role as spiritual leader of the church, the young Manalo began visiting congregations nationwide. At every location he visited, he officiated worship services and staged massive religious rallies in public plazas. During this period of transition in what critics thought was the most vulnerable period of the church, Manalo further consolidated the gains of the church. In 1947, Manalo became the General Treasurer of the church. He was later elected as successor to Felix Manalo by provincial ministers as early as 1953. In 1957 he became the District Minister of Manila. Very few people outside of the church gave Manalo&apos;s leadership potential enough credit. He would later initiate significant moves that would make the church to what it is today. Manalo demonstrated the church responsiveness to the needs of the poor. Even before the government initiated agrarian reforms, Manalo established model land reforms. In 1965, the first of the resettlement farms was Maligaya farm in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija, Philippines. Similar projects were established in Cavite, Rizal and other provinces. As early as 1967, four years after assuming leadership role, Manalo set his vision to overseas mission and global expansion. On July 27, 1968 Manalo established the first congregation of the church overseas in Honolulu, Hawaii. Other congregations were established in San Francisco and Los Angeles in California. { Villanueva, p. 7 } In 1968, Manalo moved the headquarters of the church to Diliman, Quezon City and began building major structures in what is now known as the Central Office Complex. The administration of the church is housed at the six-story Central Office building where Manalo has a permanent office. In this building are the offices of departments, social halls and is where thousand of professionals and volunteers work. Also in the complex is the Central Temple which is the largest of the church&apos;s house of worship. Nearby is the tent-shaped Tabernacle, which serves as a multi-purpose hall. { A Signature in the Sky } [ Death ] INC spokesperson Bienvenido Santiago confirmed Manalo&apos;s death in an announcement on radio stations DZBB, DZEM, DZEC, and the INC-owned Net 25 : [ Ikinalulungkot naming ipabatid sa buong Iglesia at sa buong sambayanan na ang tagapamahalang pangkalahatan ng Iglesia ni Cristo, ang kapatid na Eraño G.
