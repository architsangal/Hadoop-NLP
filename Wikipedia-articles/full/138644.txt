[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1544914 } [ 3 ] Pineville is a town in Wyoming County, West Virginia, along the Guyandotte River. The population was 715 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Wyoming County [ 6 ]. [ History ] Pineville was settled by William Short in 1853. In 1863, Hiram Clay first settled near the site of present Pineville. The community was once called Castlerock, and the post office there was once named Rock Castle. The town was renamed Pineville for the local pine forest and incorporated as a town under that name in 1907. [ http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1858 The West Virginia Encyclopedia: Pineville October 22, 2010 2011-07-23 unknown West Virginia Humanities Council ] It was named because it was built on the site of a black or pitch pine forest. It became county seat in 1907, replacing Oceana after a series of disputed elections. Castle Rock, the towering sandstone formation for which Rockcastle Creek is named, is located at Pineville and is the major local landmark. The Wyoming County courthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places. [ Geography ] Pineville is located at [ 37 34 59 N 81 32 7 W type:city ] (37.582925, -81.535302) [ 1 ]. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.8 square miles (2.0  km²), all land. Many subdivisions or outer areas are considered part of Pineville, including Key Rock, New Richmond, Skin Fork, Mullensville, Glover, Wolf Pen, Rock View, and others, but the town limits are much smaller than the area considered part of Pineville. Unique in the county school system, Pineville&apos;s secondary school had no feeder schools. Only after the county&apos;s population declined sharply in the 1990s did consolidation and closure of the Glen Rogers High School cause students who attended elementary school outside of Pineville to attend middle or high school in Pineville. Further consolidation ended the town&apos;s high school, which was consolidated with Mullens High School to form Wyoming East High School. Students from the catchement areas of the former Herndon, Glen Rogers, Mullens, and Pineville High Schools attend this high school.
