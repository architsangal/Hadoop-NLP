University District The University District (commonly, the U District) is a district of neighborhoods in Seattle, Washington, so named because the main campus of the University of Washington (UW) is located there. The UW moved in two years after the area was annexed to Seattle, while much of the area was still clear cut forest or stump farmland. The district of neighborhoods grew with the university to become like a smaller version of urban American cities. { Dorpat } Neighborhoods within the district include University Park (east from 15th ave to 25th, north from 50th St to Ravenna, Greek Row (45th to 50th streets, 15th to 25th avenues), University Heights (north of 45th and west of 15th) and the Brooklyn Addition (residential and Bohemian area west of 15th and south of 45th); as well as the Main, West and North campuses of the University of Washington. [ Location ] { This 1893 map shows the old street names of what was then the &quot; Brooklyn &quot; neighborhood. There is almost no development north of Franklin Street (now NE 45th Street). Brooklyn Avenue on this map is today&apos;s 12th Avenue NE; Broadway is todays Brooklyn NE; Columbus is University Way NE; Tremont is 15th NE.

Accessed 4 December 2007. } { The railway is now the } { Burke-Gilman Trail; several other streets have been rerouted, especially near the water. } Like all Seattle districts, the boundaries of the University District are informal; by common usage, the University District is bounded on the west by Interstate 5; on the east by 25th Avenue NE; on the south by the Lake Washington Ship Canal; and on the north by NE Ravenna Boulevard. It also includes, east of these boundaries, a small district on the north shore of Union Bay, bounded on the north by NE 45th Street and on the east by 35th Avenue NE. This extension consists mainly of the &quot; east campus &quot; and extensive parking lots of the University.

Some parts of the University District have had names of their own. For example, today &quot; University Heights &quot; mainly designates a former school used as a community center, University Heights Center for the Community; a 1905 map shows the name as applying specifically to the area bounded by what are now NE 45th Street to the south, NE 55th Street to the north, Brooklyn Avenue NE to the west, and 15th Avenue NE to the east. { Baist&apos;s Real Estate Atlas Surveys of Seattle, Wash. 1905, G. Wm. Baist, Philadelphia, 1905, plates 17 &amp; 18. } [ History ] What is now the University District has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE —10,000 years ago). Prominent Native American Duwamish villages of the Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish nations were on a then-larger Portage Bay at what is now called Brooklyn Avenue, and the other on a larger Union Bay, near the present UW power plant (which is across from the UW IMA building), around the north shores a mile farther than today, and shores east of what is now the Union Bay Natural Area. (See also adjacent Ravenna neighborhood.) The Duwamish, { Also spelled D kh w &apos;Duw&apos;Absh, pronounced } [ dxʷdɐwʔabʃ ] {. } ( &quot; People of the Inside &quot; ) tribe had the prominent village of SWAH-tsoo-gweel ( &quot; portage &quot; ) on then-adjacent Union Bay, and what is now Ravenna was their backyard before the arrival of European settlers. { Dailey, 26, ref. 2, 8 } Villages were diffuse. In spring, people dispersed from their winter villages of longhouses to camps, gathering in summer for salmon. Gaps in the forest were maintained to encourage game and food supplies. Such &quot; prairies &quot; (anthrogenic grassland s ) were cultivated in what is now the University District. { Similar remarks could be made about } { Belltown, } { South Lake Union, along the shores of } { Lake Washington (the present day route of Sand Point Way NE), and most likely } { Alki, } { Georgetown, and other locations in what is now Seattle.

See also } { Duwamish tribe } { Lushootseed } { Coast Salish } They were connected by a well-travelled path along what is now the Lake Washington Ship Canal (1883, 1916). Surveyors noted several large Douglas-firs and western red cedars (given that large trees were not unusual back then, these must have been especially large). The U. District was first surveyed in 1855, and its first white settlers arrived 12 years later. In 1890, that part of the neighborhood due west of the present UW campus was laid out as the Brooklyn Addition. One year later much of the land north of the Ship Canal, including Brooklyn, was annexed to Seattle. The UW moved from Downtown in 1893, and the first university building was built in 1895. An 1894 report describes a train wreck just west of the current University District. Latona has now been cut off from the University by Interstate 5. August 20, 1894.

The name &quot; Brooklyn &quot; began to fade soon thereafter. Electric trolley tracks had been laid up Columbus Avenue (later 14th Avenue) in 1892, and the neighborhood soon began to be called &quot; University Station &quot; after the heated waiting house at the corner of what is now NE 42nd Street (1895). The name Brooklyn is not lost, however, for Brooklyn Avenue NE runs parallel to University Way, one block west. North and west of the campus, within the University District, the University Heights—a name now little used—was named for its elementary school (1903 –c.1988; since 1990 the University Heights Center for the Community Association, hosts numerous activities small and large from the University District Community Clean Up to the University District Farmer&apos;s Market. { Long; Eskenazi. Neighborhoods within some districts in Seattle are more or less no longer in common usage. See also } { Seattle neighborhoods#Public library branches, public schools, and public parks and } {. } But for the trolley, in early decades of the U. District Downtown was a trek, a boat, and a horsecart ride away. Given these early transportation difficulties, the U. District was largely self-sufficient, with area businesses for people with ties to the University. Construction of family homes increased in the early 1900s, as did churches, theaters, stores, and a YMCA. The district&apos;s first bank and the first local public library opened in 1906, the modest library organized by local merchants. { Burrows } As a result of a contest held by the University Commercial Club in 1919, 14th Avenue (by then already known as &quot; The Avenue &quot; or &quot; The Ave &quot; ) was renamed University Way, and the neighborhood was renamed the University District (1919). The neighborhood&apos;s north-south arterials are (from west to east) Roosevelt Way NE (southbound)), 11th Avenue NE (northbound), Brooklyn Avenue NE, University Way NE, and 15th Avenue NE. NE Pacific, 45th, and part of 50th streets are principal east-west arterials, NE Campus Parkway is a minor east-west arterial, running only west of the campus.

The U District is second only to Capitol Hill as an epicenter for NoCat Free Wi-Fi with the global Seattle Wireless project. The neighborhood&apos;s skyline landmarks (other than the UW campus) are its tallest buildings: UW Tower (formerly Safeco Plaza) and the Meany Hotel (which became the Best Western University Tower and is now known as Hotel Deca). The former, originally headquarters of Safeco Corporation, is located at the corner of Brooklyn Avenue NE and NE 45th Street. It was built in 1973, and at 22 stories high is the city&apos;s tallest building outside Downtown. The latter is Art Deco (1931, restored).

The } { Interstate 5 } { Ship Canal Bridge is in the foreground. } In recent decades, the University District has suffered commercial decline, due at least in significant part to the more competitive planning, capital investment, and popularity of the University Village shopping center east of the campus, and Northgate Mall about 1-1/2 miles (2-1/2  km) north beside I-5. From 2002 to 2004, the city and the neighborhood have made some steps countering this trend by giving the Ave a repaving facelift including the addition of benches, bus bulb s, and period lighting. { Marmor; Dorpat; Kim } The addition of benches represented the reversal of a decades-long neighborhood trend away from providing free places to sit.

On Thursday (when many Greek parties are held to deter high-schoolers) and Friday nights, it is not uncommon for parties to spill out into the local streets within the area. This reputation draws many crashers, and most of the recent instances of gun violence, injury, and property damage at UW student parties have been due to party crashers getting ejected, in the context of readily available alcohol (and recreational drugs) at large student parties.
