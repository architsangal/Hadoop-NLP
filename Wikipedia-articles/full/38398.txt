The television series was filmed in and around the city of } { Vancouver, } { Canada.

Later episodes reveal that this network is capable of spanning not just planets within the Milky Way, but with sufficient power, can provide intergalactic travel as well. Stargate SG-1 chronicles the adventures of the elite special force Air Force squad, SG-1, the flagship team of over two dozen teams from Earth who explore the galaxy and defend Earth against alien threats such as the Goa&apos;uld, Replicators, and later the Ori. The composition of the SG-1 team is stable in the show&apos;s first five seasons but changes several times in the remaining seasons. The series expands upon many Ancient Earth mythologies such as Egyptian mythology, Norse mythology, and Arthurian legend. The 2008 direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum continue the adventures of SG-1. The series was a ratings success for Showtime and the Sci Fi Channel, and was particularly popular in Europe and Australia. Although it received little critical response, Stargate SG-1 was honored with numerous awards and award nominations in its ten-season run. It also spawned the animated television series Stargate Infinity in 2002, the live-action spin-off TV series Stargate Atlantis in 2004, and the live-action TV series Stargate Universe in 2009 which ended in the Spring of 2011. Merchandise for Stargate SG-1 includes games and toys, print media, and an original audio series. [ Series overview ] [ List of Stargate SG-1 episodes Mythology of Stargate Stargate Program ] Stargate SG-1 resumes the plot of the original feature film and follows the present-day adventures of SG-1, a military team from Earth. SG-1 and two dozen other SG teams venture to distant planets using a fictional alien portal known as a Stargate, which in the series is housed in a top-secret United States Air Force military base known as Stargate Command (SGC) underneath Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In the first eight seasons, the mission of the SG teams is to explore the galaxy and search for alien technology and allies to defend Earth against the Goa&apos;uld, a snake-like parasitic alien race that takes humans as unwilling hosts. As explained in the series&apos; backstory, the Goa&apos;uld transported human slaves from Earth to other habitable planets across the galaxy thousands of years ago and now pose as gods of Ancient Earth mythologies, particularly Egyptian mythology. SG-1 eventually learns that highly evolved human-like beings, known as the Ancients, had originally built the Stargate network millions of years earlier, before they used their extraordinary powers to Ascend to a higher plane of existence, after which they pledged to not interfere in the lives of other species. The Ori, who belong to the same race of ascended beings as the Ancients but who use their powers to subjugate other species, forcing them to worship the Ori and to believe a doctrine of religious fundamentalism, assume the role of the main antagonists in seasons 9 and 10. [ Goa&apos;uld arc ] { Cheyenne Mountain complex in Colorado, United States is home to Earth&apos;s fictional Stargate Command in the &apos;&apos;Stargate&apos;&apos; universe. } [ Goa&apos;uld ] The pilot episode ( &quot; Children of the Gods &quot; ), set one year after the events of the original feature film, introduces the Goa&apos;uld System Lord and main villain Apophis ( Peter Williams ) as he attacks Earth&apos;s mothballed SGC military base through the Stargate and kidnaps a soldier. The SGC is brought back into action when the Stargate is revealed to be part of an interplanetary network connecting countless planets. SG teams are created to help defend Earth against the Goa&apos;uld, who have interstellar pyramid warships and vast armies of Jaffa (hereditary slaves and human incubators to the Goa&apos;uld) at their disposal. Earth&apos;s flagship team SG-1, which includes Apophis&apos;s defected First Prime (lead Jaffa soldier) Teal&apos;c, initiates several alliances with other cultures in the galaxy, such as the Goa&apos;uld-like but truly symbiotic Tok&apos;ra, the advanced human Tollan, the pacifist Nox, the benevolent Roswell -alien Asgard, and remnants of the powerful Ancients. Another alien threat arises in the season 3 finale ( &quot; Nemesis &quot; ) in the form of sentient machines called Replicators. Meanwhile, rogue agents of a shadowy intelligence agency on Earth, the NID, repeatedly attempt to take control of the Stargate and other alien technology. Despite Apophis&apos;s death in the beginning of season 5, the Goa&apos;uld Empire remains a major foe in Stargate SG-1 until the end of season 8. The only influential Goa&apos;uld in the last two seasons of Stargate SG-1 is the System Lord Ba&apos;al ( Cliff Simon ), who is defeated in the direct-to-DVD film Stargate: Continuum. [ Anubis arc ] [ Anubis (Stargate) ] After Apophis&apos;s defeat in the season 5 premiere ( &quot; Enemies &quot; ), the half-Ascended Goa&apos;uld System Lord Anubis ( David Palffy ) becomes the main villain. He possesses much knowledge of the Ancients and their technology. While Earth builds its first interstellar spaceship (the Prometheus ) in seasons 6 and 7, Anubis creates an army of almost invincible Kull Warrior s and wipes out many of his fellow System Lords. In the season 7 finale ( &quot; Lost City &quot; ), SG-1 discovers a powerful weapon in an Ancient outpost in Antarctica that annihilates Anubis&apos;s entire fleet and also sets the stage for the spin-off series Stargate Atlantis. Ba&apos;al subsumes much of Anubis&apos;s power in season 8, while Anubis secretly regains control of his forces. Human-form Replicators begin to conquer the System Lords, but SG-1 finds and adjusts an Ancient weapon to destroy all Replicators throughout the galaxy. Near the end of season 8 ( &quot; Threads &quot; ), it is revealed that the benevolent Ascended Being Oma Desala ( Mel Harris ) is responsible for Anubis&apos;s original ascension. When she engages Anubis in an eternal stalemated battle on the Ascended plane to prevent his acting on the mortal plane, the Replicators and most System Lords have already been annihilated, and the Jaffa win their freedom from Goa&apos;uld rule. [ Ori arc ] [ Ori (Stargate) ] The original SG-1 team disbands after the events of season 8, but slowly reunites under new team leader Col. Cameron Mitchell after the SGC inadvertently draws the attention of the Ancient-like Ori from another galaxy to the existence of sentient life in the Milky Way. While the Ori send enhanced human beings named Priors to the Milky Way to spread a religion that will augment the Ori&apos;s power, Ba&apos;al and some minor Goa&apos;uld infiltrate Earth through the Trust (a coalition of rogue NID operatives) to rebuild their power. At the end of season 9 ( &quot; Camelot (Part 1) &quot; ), the Ori begin an evangelistic crusade with their warships and effortlessly wipe out the combined fleet of Earth and its allies. The leader of the Ori, Adria ( Morena Baccarin ), is introduced in the premiere of season 10 ( &quot; Flesh and Blood (Part 2) &quot; ). SG-1 searches for the Sangraal, an Ancient weapon that might defeat the Ori, while Ba&apos;al and his clones attempt to find the weapon for their own purposes. With the help of the powerful Ancient Merlin ( Matthew Walker ), SG-1 finds the construction plans of the Sangraal and sends a working version to the Ori galaxy. Shortly thereafter, Adria ascends. The direct-to-DVD film Stargate: The Ark of Truth ends the Ori arc.

He is coaxed out of retirement in the pilot episode and serves as the leader of the SG-1 team in the first seven seasons. He takes charge of Stargate Command (SGC) after his promotion to Brigadier General at the beginning of season 8. The series repeatedly alludes to romantic feelings between O&apos;Neill and his second-in-command, Carter, but the relationship is never shown as consummated outside of alternate reality scenarios. O&apos;Neill is reassigned to Washington, D.C. before season 9 and receives a promotion to Major General. He appears in a recurring role in seasons 9 and 10 of Stargate SG-1, as well as in Stargate: Continuum and in seasons 1 and 3 of Stargate Atlantis. O&apos;Neill appears as a Lieutenant General in multiple episodes of Stargate Universe where he is in command of the Department of Homeworld Security. Michael Shanks as Daniel Jackson (seasons 1–5 and 7–10 main, season 6 recurring)  – A brilliant Egyptologist whose far-fetched theories about Egyptian pyramids having been built by aliens led to his participation in the original Stargate mission in the feature film (where he was played by James Spader ). He joins the SG-1 team to facilitate his search for his wife, who was kidnapped by Apophis in the pilot episode, but his naïveté and curiosity regularly create obstacles for the team. He gradually evolves from being an archaeologist and translator into the moral conscience for the team, and remains part of SG-1 until he ascends to a higher plane of existence at the end of season 5. Following his forceful de-ascension at the beginning of season 7, he rejoins SG-1 for the remainder of the series. The last three seasons show his flirty yet antagonistic relationship with Vala Mal Doran. Daniel also appears in both direct-to-DVD films, in seasons 1 and 5 of Stargate Atlantis, and in three Stargate Universe episodes. Amanda Tapping as Samantha &quot; Sam &quot; Carter (seasons 1–10 main)  – A brilliant young astrophysicist and United States Air Force Captain who joins SG-1 under the command of Col. O&apos;Neill in the pilot episode. Following her promotion to Major in season 3, she is promoted to Lieutenant Colonel early in season 8 and assumes command of SG-1. The series repeatedly alludes to romantic feelings between Carter and O&apos;Neill, but the relationship is never shown as consummated outside of alternate reality scenarios. Carter assists Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell in seasons 9 and 10. After her appearance in Stargate: The Ark of Truth, she is promoted to Colonel and becomes the new commander of the Atlantis expedition in season 4 of Stargate Atlantis, before joining SG-1 again for Stargate: Continuum. Carter appears in a recurring role in all seasons of Stargate Atlantis (and as a regular in Season 4) and in the first episode of Stargate: Universe as commander of the starship George Hammond. Christopher Judge as Teal&apos;c (seasons 1–10 main)  – A quiet and strong Jaffa alien who defects from his position as the First Prime of the Goa&apos;uld Apophis. He joins SG-1 after the pilot episode in hopes of leading his race to freedom. Despite succeeding in this goal at the end of season 8, he remains a member of SG-1 until the end of the series. He also appears in both direct-to-DVD films and in season 4 of Stargate Atlantis as a mentor for Ronan during an interview for the IOA. Don S. Davis as George Hammond (seasons 1–7 main, seasons 8–10 recurring)  – A United States Air Force Major General (later Lieutenant General) who commands Stargate Command in the first seven seasons. Besides recurring in seasons 8 through 10 of Stargate SG-1, he appears in season 1 of Stargate Atlantis. Davis died from a heart attack in June 2008, making his appearance in Stargate: Continuum his last. Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn (season 6 main, seasons 5 and 7 recurring)  – A humanoid alien and scientist from the country of Kelowna on the planet Langara. Daniel sacrifices his life (leading to his ascension) at the end of season 5 in an attempt to save Kelowna, but the following gleeful reaction of the Kelownan leaders causes Jonas to turn his back on Langara. Jonas is a fast learner and fills Daniel&apos;s empty spot on SG-1 in season 6. Following Daniel&apos;s return, Jonas returns to his planet and remains a recurring character in season 7. Ben Browder as Cameron &quot; Cam &quot; Mitchell (seasons 9–10 main)  – A United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel who is assigned as the new commanding officer of SG-1 at the beginning of season 9. He struggles to reunite its former members under his command and commands SG-1 (with Lt. Col. Carter&apos;s assistance) until the end of season 10. He is promoted to Colonel between his appearances in Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum. Beau Bridges as Henry &quot; Hank &quot; Landry (seasons 9–10 main)  – A United States Air Force Major General and the commander of Stargate Command in seasons 9 and 10. He is the estranged father of the SGC&apos;s medical officer Carolyn Lam and appears in both direct-to-DVD films and in seasons 2 and 3 of Stargate Atlantis. Claudia Black as Vala Mal Doran (season 10 main, seasons 8–9 recurring)  – A con artist from an unnamed planet and a former human host to the Goa&apos;uld Qetesh. Her first appearance in season 8&apos;s &quot; Prometheus Unbound &quot; is the beginning of her flirty yet antagonistic relationship with Daniel. In her recurring role in season 9, she and Daniel unintentionally set off the new Ori threat. She joins SG-1 after giving birth to the new leader of the Ori at the beginning of season 10, and appears in both direct-to-DVD films.

[ Children of the Gods Stargate SG-1 (season 1) ] Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner had worked together on the MGM television series The Outer Limits since 1995. Upon hearing of MGM&apos;s plan to create a television spin-off series of the feature film Stargate, Wright and Glassner independently and unbeknownst to each other approached MGM and proposed their concept for the television series. MGM president John Symes greenlit the project on the condition that Wright and Glassner work together as executive producers of the new show. [ Wright, Brad; Glassner, Jonathan; Greenburg, Michael; Anderson, Richard Dean; Shanks, Michael 2001 Stargate SG-1: Season 3 – Timeline To The Future – Part 1: Legacy Of The Gate DVD MGM Home Entertainment ] The show was named Stargate SG-1 after Wright flightily agreed to Symes&apos;s pitch question of whether the team should be called &quot; SG-1 &quot;. MGM released posters titled Stargate SG-1 within the next week without the knowledge of Wright or Glassner. [ Wright, Brad 2006 Stargate SG-1: Season 9 – Profile On: Brad Wright DVD MGM Home Entertainment ] John Symes approached Michael Greenburg and Richard Dean Anderson of MacGyver fame. Anderson agreed to become involved with the project if his character Jack O&apos;Neill was allowed significantly more comedic leeway than Kurt Russell &apos;s character in the feature film. He also requested Stargate SG-1 to be more of an ensemble show, so that he would not be carrying the plot alone as on MacGyver. [ Eramo Steven Richard Dean Anderson – Mr Anderson – Colonel O&apos;Neill TV Zone Special 46 4–9 July 2002 ] The American subscription channel Showtime made a two-season commitment for 44 episodes in 1996.

[ Shanks, Michael 2001 Stargate SG-1: Season 3 – Profile On Daniel Jackson DVD MGM Home Entertainment ] The producers found Judge the easiest to cast due to his muscular presence. Shanks was cast because he did &quot; the perfect imitation of James Spader &quot;, according to Wright. The producers knew Don S. Davis from his work as a stand-in and stunt-double for Dana Elcar in MacGyver and approached him to read for the role of George Hammond. [ Davis, Don.

Although the prop had severely deteriorated, he was able to take a detailed mold for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, to lock the chevrons, and to be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.

Playing a civilian, Michael Shanks adopted James Spader&apos;s hairstyle from the feature film but cut it short for the season 2 finale and subsequent seasons. The Jaffa alien Teal&apos;c (Christopher Judge) was the only main character whose look required more than basic make-up. His Egyptian look was reflective of the Goa&apos;uld Ra from the feature film and was complemented with a forehead symbol and a gold skin tone, although his make-up process was simplified over the years. [ Eramo Steven Jan Newman – Born With It – Make-up TV Zone Special 46 62–65 July 2002 ] Judge shaved his head at home each day until the producers allowed him to let his hair grow in season 8. As a trained nurse, key make-up artist Jan Newman could make burns, cuts, bruises and the SG-1 team&apos;s other wounds look authentic. For the look of aliens, the make-up department collaborated with prosthetics companies from Vancouver and Los Angeles, including Todd Masters. While the human origins of many alien races and human civilizations were left recognizable, the recurring Unas race required elaborate prosthetics and make-up work. To mirror the independent development of the fictional human civilizations after their displacement from Earth, the costume designers took elements of the respective Earth cultures, and combined them with modern fabrics, elaborate trims and chains that would give a historical yet otherworldly appearance. [ McQuarrie, Christina 2001 Stargate SG-1: Season 3 – Costume Design: Christina McQuarrie DVD MGM Home Entertainment ] The look of the Goa&apos;uld such as Apophis was initially based on Ra in the feature film. For the design of the Ori and the Priors in season 9, the art department looked at Japanese and Samurai garments for costume design. Art director James Robbins found the face painting, scarification and burns of remote jungle tribes mystical, serving as inspiration for the face scarification of the Priors and the Doci. Early considerations of finger extensions and scarification on their hands were discarded as impracticable.

Many companies were hired to create the Stargate&apos;s water-like event horizon in the beginning, but Rainmaker eventually became the only company to create those visual effects. Rainmaker&apos;s regular effects shots included the activation and use of the Stargate itself (with well over 300 event horizon shots in the first few years), the transport rings, and the blast shots of the staff weapons and zat guns. They created the visual effects for Goa&apos;uld cargo ships and death gliders on a less regular basis.

Goldsmith and David Arnold, the composer of the original feature film score, discussed themes for a television adaptation. The main titles of Stargate SG-1 were a medley of several themes from the feature film, although Goldsmith also wrote a unique end title for SG-1 to establish the show as its own entity. MGM eventually insisted on using Arnold&apos;s score in the pilot episode instead of Goldsmith&apos;s, but Brad Wright&apos;s 2009 direct-to-DVD recut of Children of the Gods uses Goldsmith&apos;s original score.

Goldsmith&apos;s long-time assistant Neal Acree started composing additional music for Stargate SG-1 in season 8. The amount of composed music varied between 12 and 33 minutes out of a 44-minute episode, with an average of around 22 to 26 minutes, [ Read Darren http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/the_language_of_emotion.shtml The Language of Emotion – GateWorld talks with Neal Acree GateWorld March 2009 2009-03-31 ] making the full symphonic score of SG-1 more time-consuming to create than for general TV shows. Since Goldsmith lived a thousand miles away from Vancouver, he and the producers discussed ideas over the phone { Gibson 2003, pp. 150–151. } and exchanged tapes via Federal Express for several years until the show switched to Internet file transfers.

The Ancient theme was deliberately carried over to Stargate Atlantis. The end of &quot; Lost City &quot; has a basic melody that would become part of the main title of Atlantis per a suggestion by Goldsmith&apos;s assistant. Non-original music was rarely used on SG-1, although Goldsmith chose the aria &quot; Vesti la giubba &quot; from Leoncavallo &apos;s &quot; Pagliaccio &quot; for the season 3&apos;s &quot; Shades of Grey &quot;.

The credits are normally sixty seconds long. Richard Dean Anderson was the only SG-1 actor whose name appeared before the show&apos;s title. Michael Shanks&apos;s name was moved near the end of the opening credits with the appendage &quot; as Daniel Jackson &quot; after his return to the show in season 7. Some DVD versions of early SG-1 seasons have different opening credits than the television versions, as do the direct-to-DVD films. Composer Joel Goldsmith adapted David Arnold &apos;s Stargate feature film score for SG-1 s opening title theme, which remained the same during the run of Stargate SG-1 and its direct-to-DVD films. { Tutankhamun &apos;s golden mask (pictured). } The first opening title sequence, used in the first five seasons, shows a slow-pan camera move over Ra &apos;s mask. The Stargate SG-1 producers had run out of time before the premiere of season 1 and simply re-used the accelerated opening title sequence of the feature film. Ra &apos;s mask had been created in the feature film&apos;s model shop and had originally been filmed with a motion-control camera. [ Devlin, Dean and Emmerich, Roland 2001 Audio Commentary for Stargate DVD MGM Home Entertainment ] Partly because Ra &apos;s mask looked cross-eyed, Brad Wright approached the art department in the following years to produce a new opening title sequence; however, the sequence remained the same until the show&apos;s move to the Sci-Fi Channel. During the first five seasons when the show was syndicated a separate introduction was used; this intro is still used by Sci-Fi for seasons 1-5. This version uses action shots of the original cast.

The opening credits of the following episodes intercut this material with live-action shots of the characters from previous seasons and ended with the SG-1 team stepping through the Stargate. The opening credits stayed the same in the next two seasons except for minor clip and cast changes. The opening credits of season 9 intercut shots of the Stargate with action sequences similar to the previous opening credits, although the Stargate was visibly computer-generated. The Sci Fi Channel cut the opening credits from sixty to ten seconds in their original broadcast of the first half of season 9, but re-instated the full opening credits after strong negative fan reactions.

Before the beginning of the series, the USAF granted production access to the Cheyenne Mountain complex to film stock shots. They also read every script for mistakes and provided help with plausible background stories for all characters, ribbons, uniform regulations, hair advice, plotlines, and military relationships. The USAF flew up several T-38 Talon, F-15 and F-16 fighter jets to Vancouver for various episodes and direct-to-DVD films. Many of the extras portraying USAF personnel were real USAF personnel. Two successive Chiefs of Staff of the USAF, Generals Michael E. Ryan and John P.

Stargate SG-1 takes place in a military science fiction environment and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy (the Goa&apos;uld ). However, it links alien races with well-known Earth mythologies, by use of the central Stargate device. Near-instantaneous interplanetary travel allows quick narrative shifts between the politics on Earth and the realities of fighting an interstellar war. { Beeler 2008, pp. 267–269. } Stargate SG-1 gradually evolves the basic premise of the Stargate film into its own unique mythological superstructure, { Beeler and Dickson 2005. &quot; Introduction &quot;, pp. 1–5. } expanding upon Egyptian mythology (notably the gods Apep /Apophis and Anubis as Goa&apos;uld villains), Norse mythology (notably the god Thor as an Asgard ally ), and Arthurian legend (notably Merlin as an Ancient ally against the god-like Ori ), among others. SG-1 introduces new alien races (as opposed to alien human civilizations) less often than other science fiction television series and integrates newly encountered races or visited planets in stand-alone episodes into its established mythology while leaving the plotlines accessible for new audience members. { Beeler 2008, pp. 273–277. } Despite the show&apos;s extensive intergalactic mythology and science fiction elements, scholar M. Keith Booker considered SG-1 ultimately character-driven and heavily dependent on the camaraderie among the SG-1 members. { Booker 2004, pp. 181–182. } The producers embraced humor and wanted SG-1 to be a fun show that did not take itself too seriously. Brad Wright regarded SG-1 as a family show with adequate violence as opposed to random or gratuitous violence. Christopher Judge did not consider SG-1 as a &quot; message show by any stretch of the imagination, but occasionally there are messages there &quot;. { Gbison 2003, p. 92. } Aimed at a popular audience, Stargate SG-1 emphasized its present-day-Earth story frame by frequently referencing popular culture, like The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer had done before. { Hipple, Dave, &quot; Stargate SG-1: Self-possessed Science Fiction &quot;.
