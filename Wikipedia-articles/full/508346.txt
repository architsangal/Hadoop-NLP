In-water recompression or underwater oxygen treatment (IWR) is the emergency treatment of decompression sickness (DCS) of sending the diver back underwater to allow the gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve. It is a risk y procedure that should only ever be used when the time to travel to the nearest recompression chamber is too long to save the victim&apos;s life. [ Kay E. M. P. Spencer.

The risk of the procedure comes from the fact that a diver suffering from DCS is seriously ill and may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any one of these events is likely to result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface.

The principle behind IWR treatment is the same as that behind the treatment of DCS in a recompression chamber : an increase in ambient pressure will reduce the volume of the bubbles allowing better blood transport downstream of the bubbles. If the casualty can breathe pure oxygen further improvements will occur because the increase in the proportion of oxygen in the blood may keep previously oxygen-starved tissues alive and the oxygen will remove other inert gases from the bubbles making the bubbles smaller. The use of in-water oxygen at 6 meters has been shown to reduce bubble loads in divers compared to divers breathing oxygen on the surface.

Dr Edmonds also described the debates about underwater oxygen treatment for DCS that are not unlike current concerns. Inappropriate cases for treatment, Oxygen toxicity, Emergency Termination of Treatment, Hypothermia Adequacy of Equipment in Remote Areas, Seasickness, Operator Expertise and Training, Safety of the Diving Attendant and the Boat Tenders, Requirement for Medical Supervision, Transport Availability, Misuse of Equipment, Pulmonary Barotrauma Cases. [ Equipment ] Some of the equipment needed includes : a means of securely holding the casualty at a measured depth, such as a harness and 20 metre line with a 20  kg lead weight at the bottom and 40 litre buoy at the top a means of allowing the casualty to ascend slowly, such as loops in the line to which the harness could be clipped full face diving mask s for the casualty and for an in-water tending diver including two-way communication to the surface and an umbilical gas supply surface supplied breathing gas es including pure oxygen and air delivered to the casualty by umbilical voice communications equipment to the divers use IWR treatment &quot; table &quot; [ In-Water Recompression Tables ] Six IWR treatment tables have been published in the scientific literature. Each of these methods have several commonalities including the use of a full face mask, a tender to supervise the diver during treatment, a weighted recompression line and a means of communication. The history of the three older methods for providing oxygen at 9m (30 fsw) was described in great detail by Drs. Pyle and Youngblood. The fourth method for providing oxygen at 7.5 m (25 fsw) was described by Pyle at the 48th Annual UHMS Workshop on In-water Recompression in 1999. The Clipperton method involves recompression to 9m (30 fsw) while the Clipperton(a) rebreather method involves a recompression to 30m (98 fsw).

It was the shallow portion of the table developed for recompression chamber use. Oxygen is breathed the entire portion of the treatment without any air breaks and is followed by alternating periods (12 hours) of oxygen and air breathing on the surface. [ Clipperton In-water Recompression Tables ] Clipperton In-water Recompression Table Clipperton(a) In-water Recompression Table The Clipperton and Clipperton(a) methods were developed for use on a scientific mission to the atoll of Clipperton, 1,300  km from the Mexican coasts. The two versions are based on the equipment available for treatment with the Clipperton(a) table being designed for use with rebreathers. Both methods begin with 10 minutes of surface oxygen. For the Clipperton IWR table, oxygen is then breathed the entire portion of the treatment without any air breaks. For the Clipperton IWR table, descent is made to the initial treatment depth maintaining a partial pressure of 1.4 ATA. Oxygen breathing on the surface for 6 hours post treatment and intravenous fluids are also administered following both treatment tables. [ Hawaiian In-water Recompression Table ] Hawaiian In-water Recompression Table The Hawaiian IWR table was first described by Farm et al. while studying the diving habits of Hawaii &apos;s diving fishermen. The initial portion of the treatment involves descent on air to the depth of relief plus 30 fsw or a maximum of 165 fsw for ten minutes. Ascent from initial treatment depth to 30 fsw occurs over 10 minutes. The diver then completes the treatment breathing oxygen and is followed by oxygen breathing on the surface for 30 minutes post treatment. The Hawaiian IWR Table with Pyle modifications can be found in the proceedings of the DAN 2008 Technical Diving Conference (In Press) or through download from DAN here. [ Pyle In-water Recompression Table ] Pyle In-water Recompression Table The Pyle IWR table was developed by Dr. Richard Pyle as a method for treating DCS in the field following scientific dives. This method begins with a 10 minute surface oxygen evaluation period. Compression to 25 fsw on oxygen for another 10 minute evaluation period. The table is best described by the treatment algorithm ( Pyle IWR algorithm ). This table does include alternating air breathing periods or &quot; air breaks &quot;. [ US Navy In-water Recompression Tables ] US Navy Type I Symptoms In-water Recompression Table US Navy Type II Symptoms In-water Recompression Table The US Navy developed two IWR treatment tables. The table used depends on the symptoms diagnosed by the medical officer. Oxygen is breathed the entire portion of the treatment without any air breaks and is followed by 3 hours of oxygen breathing on the surface. [ &quot; Informal &quot; in-water recompression ] Although in-water recompression is regarded as risky, and to be avoided, there is increasing evidence that technical divers who surface and demonstrate mild DCS symptoms may often get back into the water and breathe pure oxygen at a depth 20 feet/6 meters for a period of time to seek to alleviate the symptoms. This trend is noted in paragraph 3.6.5 of DAN &apos;s 2008 accident report. [ http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/medical/report/2008DANDivingReport.pdf Annual Diving Report:2008 edition Divers Alert Network 2009-09-01 ] The report also notes that whilst the reported incidents showed very little success, &quot; [w]e must recognize that these calls were mostly because the attemped IWR failed. In case the IWR were successful, [the] diver would not have called to report the event. Thus we do not know how often IWR may have been used successfully. &quot; [ See also ] [ Underwater diving ] [ References ] [ 2 ] [ Additional reading ] [ Mitchell SJ, Doolette DJ, Wachholz CJ, Vann RD Management of Mild or Marginal Decompression Illness in Remote Locations Workshop Proceedings. http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5523 2005 Divers Alert Network United States 240 2008-06-08 ] [ Elliott D.
