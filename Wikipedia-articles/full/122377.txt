The population was 7,477 at the 2010 census. [ History ] Williams Brothers Store. Neshoba county and surrounding counties was the heart of Choctaw territory from the 17th century until removal of most of the people in the 1830s. European-American settlers began to arrive in numbers in the early decades of the nineteenth century, after French, British and Spanish traders developed business relationships with the Choctaw. Philadelphia is incorporated as a municipality; it was given its current name in 1903, two years before the railroad brought new opportunities and prosperity to the town. The history of the town and its influences- social, political and economic- can be seen in the many points of interest within and beyond the city limits. These range from the large ceremonial Indian mound and cave at Nanih Waiya, built about 1700 years ago and sacred to the Choctaw; to the still thriving Williams Brothers Store, a true old-fashioned general store founded in 1907 and featured in National Geographic in 1939 as a source of anything from “needles to horse collars”, and still offering everything from bridle s, butter and boots to flour, feed and fashion. [ Native American ] [ Choctaw Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians ] Many thousands of years ago, Paleo-Indians lived in what today is referred to as the American South. [ http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm Pushmataha, Choctaw Indian Chief 2008-02-11 Guy Prentice Prentice Guy 2003 Southeast Chronicles ] The Native American Choctaw people are descended from the Mississippian and other societies in the Mississippi river valley encountered by Spanish explorers in the early 16th century. The Choctaw arose as a distinct people in the early 17th century and had trade relations with the French, British and Spanish during the colonial period. After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, Choctaw lands Alabama and Mississippi were encroached on by European-American settlers. Trying to create a boundary, they ceded land in several treaties with the United States, but settlers kept arriving in their territory. By 1830, after passage of the Indian Removal Act, the Choctaw were forced to choose between removal to west of the Mississippi River, or becoming U.S. citizens and submitting to federal and state laws in Mississippi. [ Check digit (7) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] { 1977, 1998 } Choctaw chiefs realized that removal was inevitable and had decided that military resistance was futile. Greenwood LeFlore, elected the Principal Chief of all three divisions that year, negotiated and signed the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in an effort to get the best arrangements for the Choctaw that he could. They were granted the largest amount of land in Indian Territory, in the fertile southeast, in exchange for ceding the remainder of their traditional homeland in Mississippi and Alabama. They also were granted the option of remaining on reserved land in Mississippi as United States citizens, but the government did not give them all the land they deserved. The treaty represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. The migration became known as the Choctaw Trail of Tears. [ Murders of three civil rights workers ] [ Mississippi civil rights workers murders ] { Andrew Goodman, } { James Chaney, and } { Michael Schwerner } In the mid-twentieth century, Mississippi was a site for activities of the civil rights movement as, like other states of the South, it had long disfranchised African Americans and subjected them to racial segregation and Jim Crow laws. Philadelphia in June 1964 was the site of the murders of activists James Chaney, a 21-year-old black man from Meridian, Mississippi; Andrew Goodman, a 20-year-old Jew ish anthropology student from New York; and Michael Schwerner, a 24-year-old Jewish CORE organizer and former social worker, also from New York. Their deaths symbolized the risks that activists took to secure the constitutional rights of African Americans, but many more blacks than whites had been killed in the struggle. Ku Klux Klan members (including Cecil Ray Price, the deputy sheriff of Neshoba County) released the three young men from jail, took them to an isolated spot, and killed them. They buried them in an earthen dam. It was some time after they disappeared before the bodies were discovered, as a result of an FBI investigation and national media attention. { Lynching of Chaney, Schwerner &amp; Goodman ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans } The national outrage over their deaths helped procure support for Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The murders and related conspiracy gave rise to the &quot; Mississippi Burning &quot; trial, United States v. Price. [ Reagan&apos;s visit ] [ Ronald Reagan&apos;s speech at the Neshoba County Fair ] On August 3, 1980, Ronald Reagan gave his first post- convention speech at the Neshoba County Fair after being officially chosen as the Republican nominee for President of the United States. He said, &quot; I believe in states&apos; rights... I believe we have distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended to be given in the Constitution to that federal establishment. &quot; He went on to promise to &quot; restore to states and local governments the power that properly belongs to them &quot;. { http://www.onlinemadison.com/ftp/reagan/reaganneshoba.mp3 } Analysts believed that his use of the phrase was seen by many as a tacit appeal to Southern white voters and a continuation of Richard Nixon &apos;s Southern Strategy, while some argued it reflected Reagan&apos;s libertarian economic beliefs. The speech drew attention for his use of the phrase &quot; states&apos; rights &quot; at a place just a few miles from a town associated with the 1964 murders of civil rights workers.

Killen was arrested for three counts of murder on January 6, 2005. He was freed on bond. The trial began on June 13, 2005, with Killen attending in a wheelchair. He was found guilty of manslaughter on June 21, 2005, 41 years to the day after the crime. The jury of nine whites and three blacks rejected the charges of murder, but found him guilty of recruiting the mob that carried out the killings. He was sentenced on June 23, 2005 by Circuit Judge Marcus Gordon to the maximum sentence of 60 years in prison, { Pearson, Sophia. &quot; Killen Sentenced to 60 Years in Prison in 1964 Deaths (Update4). &quot; } { Bloomberg. June 23, 2005. Retrieved on August 14, 2010. } 20 years for each count of manslaughter, to be served consecutively. He will be eligible for parole after serving at least 20 years, although it is unlikely he will live this long given his age and health. At the sentencing, Judge Gordon stated that each life lost was valuable; he strongly asserted that the law made no distinction of age for the crime and that the maximum sentence should be imposed. Killen entered the Mississippi Department of Corrections system on June 27, 2005. [ First black mayor ] In May 2009, Philadelphia elected its first black mayor, James A.
