The following list in mathematics contains the finite group s of small order up to group isomorphism. The list can be used to determine which known group a given finite group G is isomorphic to: first determine the order of G, then look up the candidates for that order in the list below. If you know whether G is abelian or not, some candidates can be eliminated right away. To distinguish between the remaining candidates, look at the orders of your group&apos;s elements, and match it with the orders of the candidate group&apos;s elements. [ Glossary ] Z n : the cyclic group of order n (often the notation C n is used, it is isomorphic to Z/nZ). Dih n : the dihedral group of order 2n (often the notation D n or D 2n is used ) S n : the symmetric group of degree n, containing the &apos;&apos;n&apos;&apos;! permutation s of n elements. A n : the alternating group of degree n, containing the n!/2 even permutation s of n elements. Dic n : the dicyclic group of order 4n. The notations Z n and Dih n have the advantage that point groups in three dimensions C n and D n do not have the same notation. There are more isometry group s than these two, of the same abstract group type. The notation G &amp; times; H stands for the direct product of the two groups; G n denotes the direct product of a group with itself n times. G \rtimes H stands for a semidirect product where H acts on G; where the particular action of H on G is omitted, it is because all possible non-trivial actions result in the same product group, up to isomorphism. Abelian and simple group s are noted. (For groups of order n &lt; 60, the simple groups are precisely the cyclic groups Z n, for prime n.) The equality sign ( &quot; = &quot; ) denotes isomorphism. The identity element in the cycle graphs is represented by the black circle. The lowest order for which the cycle graph does not uniquely represent a group is order 16. In the lists of subgroups the trivial group and the group itself are not listed. Where there are multiple isomorphic subgroups, their number is indicated in parentheses. [ List of small abelian groups ] The finite abelian groups are easily classified: they are cyclic groups, or direct products thereof; see abelian group s.

The groups are listed up to isomorphism. At present, the library contains the following groups: { Hans Ulrich Besche The Small Groups library } [ 423 164 062 ] [ 49 487 365 422 ] those of order at most 2000, except for order 1024 ( groups in the library; the ones of order 1024 had to be skipped, as there are an additional nonisomorphic 2-groups of order 1024.); those of cubefree order at most 50000 (395 703 groups); those of squarefree order; those of order p^n for n at most 6 and p prime; those of order p^7 for p = 3,5,7,11 (907 489 groups); those of order q n &amp; times;p where q n divides 2 8, 3 6, 5 5 or 7 4 and p is an arbitrary prime which differs from q; those whose orders factorise into at most 3 primes. It contains explicit descriptions of the available groups in computer readable format.
