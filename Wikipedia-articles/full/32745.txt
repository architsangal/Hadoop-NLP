The planet is named after Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright enough to cast shadows. Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8°. Venus reaches its maximum brightness shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset, for which reason it has been known as the Morning Star or Evening Star. Venus is classified as a terrestrial planet and it is sometimes called Earth&apos;s &quot; sister planet &quot; owing to their similar size, gravity, and bulk composition. Venus is covered with an opaque layer of highly reflective cloud s of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. Venus has the most dense atmosphere of all the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, consisting of mostly carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet&apos;s surface is 92 times that of the Earth. Venus has no carbon cycle to lock carbon back into rocks and surface features, nor does it seem to have any organic life to absorb it in biomass. Venus is believed to have previously possessed oceans, [ Hashimoto, G. L.; Roos-Serote, M.; Sugita, S.; Gilmore, M. S.; Kamp, L. W.; Carlson, R. W.; Baines, K. H.

[ Physical characteristics ] Venus is one of the four solar terrestrial planet s, meaning that, like the Earth, it is a rocky body. In size and mass, it is very similar to the Earth, and is often described as Earth&apos;s &quot; sister &quot; or &quot; twin &quot;. [ Lopes, Rosaly M. C.; Gregg, Tracy K. P. Volcanic worlds: exploring the Solar System&apos;s volcanoes Springer 2004 3-540-00431-9 61 ] The diameter of Venus is 12,092 km (only 650  km less than the Earth&apos;s) and its mass is 81.5% of the Earth&apos;s. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth, owing to its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere. The mass of the atmosphere of Venus is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.

It was finally mapped in detail by Project Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate there have been some recent eruptions.

The northern continent is called Ishtar Terra, after Ishtar, the Babylon ian goddess of love, and is about the size of Australia. Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, lies on Ishtar Terra. Its peak is 11  km above the Venusian average surface elevation. The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America. A network of fractures and faults covers much of this area. [ Kaufmann W. J. 1994 Universe W. H. Freeman New York 204 0-7167-2379-4 ] { Pioneer Venus Orbiter collected these data with radar. } The absence of evidence of lava flow accompanying any of the visible caldera remains an enigma. The planet has few impact crater s, demonstrating the surface is relatively young, approximately 300–600 million years old. In addition to the impact crater s, mountains, and valleys commonly found on rocky planets, Venus has a number of unique surface features. Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called &quot; farra &quot;, which look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20–50  km across, and 100–1,000  m high; radial, star-like fracture systems called &quot; novae &quot;; features with both radial and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as &quot; arachnoids &quot;; and &quot; coronae &quot;, circular rings of fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are volcanic in origin.

Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it possesses some 167 large volcanoes that are over 100  km across. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii. This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older. Earth&apos;s oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plate s, and has an average age of about 100 million years, [ Karttunen, Hannu; Kroger, P.; Oja, H.; Poutanen, M.; Donner, K. J. Fundamental Astronomy 162 Springer 2007 3-540-34143-9 ] while the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300–600 million years old. Several lines of evidence point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 11 and Venera 12 probes detected a constant stream of lightning, and Venera 12 recorded a powerful clap of thunder soon after it landed. The European Space Agency &apos;s Venus Express recorded abundant lightning in the high atmosphere. [ http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/11/28/venus.lightning.ap/index.html Venus also zapped by lightning CNN November 29, 2007 2007-11-29 http://web.archive.org/web/20071130201237/http%3A//www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/11/28/venus.lightning.ap/index.html November 30, 2007 ] While rainfall drives thunderstorm s on Earth, there is no rainfall on the surface of Venus (though it does rain sulfuric acid, in the upper atmosphere, which evaporates around 25  km above the surface). One possibility is ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which were found to drop by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986. This may imply the levels had earlier been boosted by a large volcanic eruption. [ Glaze L. S. 1999 Transport of SO2 by explosive volcanism on Venus Journal of Geophysical Research 104 E8 18899–18906 10.1029/1998JE000619 1999JGR...10418899G http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1999/1998JE000619.shtml 2009-01-16 ] { Impact crater s on the surface of Venus (image reconstructed from radar data) } Almost a thousand impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as the Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, while on Earth, it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, [ Strom R. G. Schaber, G. G.; Dawsow, D. D. 1994 The global resurfacing of Venus Journal of Geophysical Research 99 E5 10899–10926 10.1029/94JE00388 1994JGR....9910899S ] followed by a decay in volcanism.

Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust. Venusian craters range from 3  km to 280  km in diameter. No craters are smaller than 3  km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects. Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere, they do not create an impact crater. [ Herrick R. R. Phillips, R. J. 1993 Effects of the Venusian atmosphere on incoming meteoroids and the impact crater population Icarus 112 1 253–281 10.1006/icar.1994.1180 1994Icar..112..253H ] Incoming projectiles less than 50 meters in diameter will fragment and burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.

Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate. [ Faure, Gunter; Mensing, Teresa M. 2007 Introduction to planetary science: the geological perspective Springer eBook collection Springer 1-4020-5233-2 201 ] The slightly smaller size of Venus suggests pressures are significantly lower in its deep interior than Earth. The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.

The density at the surface is 65  kg/m³ (6.5% that of water).

A dynamo requires three things: A conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core is thought to be electrically conductive and, while its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. [ Luhmann J. G., Russell C. T. J. H.

On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat energy from the core is being used to reheat the crust. [ Francis Nimmo 2002 Why does Venus lack a magnetic field?

Another possibility is its core has already completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is unknown at present. The weak magnetosphere around Venus means the solar wind is interacting directly with the outer atmosphere of the planet. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape the planet&apos;s gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, while higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, are more likely to be retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind most probably led to the loss of most of the planet&apos;s water during the first billion years after it formed. The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the upper atmosphere by a multiple of 150 times the ratio in the lower atmosphere.

Venus is the second planet from the Sun and it revolves round the Sun approximately 1.6 times (yellow trail) in Earth&apos;s 365 days (blue trail) } Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 108 million kilometers (about 0.7 AU ), and completes an orbit every 224.65 days. Although all planetary orbit s are elliptical, Venus is the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01. When Venus lies between the Earth and the Sun, a position known as inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to Earth of any planet at an average distance of 41  million  km. The planet reaches inferior conjunction every 584 days, on average. Owing to the decreasing eccentricity of Earth&apos;s orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year 1 to 5383, 526 approaches less than 40  million  km happen; then happen none for about 60,158 years.

All the planets of the Solar System orbit in a counter-clockwise direction as viewed from above the Sun&apos;s north pole. Most planets also rotate counter-clockwise, but Venus rotates clockwise (called &quot; retrograde &quot; rotation) once every 243 Earth days—by far the slowest rotation period of any major planet. The equator of the Venusian surface rotates at 6.5  km/h, while on Earth rotation speed at the equator is about 1,670  km/h. [ Bakich, Michael E. 2000 The Cambridge planetary handbook Cambridge University Press 0-521-63280-3 50 ] A Venusian sidereal day thus lasts longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day. As a result of Venus&apos;s relatively long solar day, one Venusian year is about 1.92 Venusian days long. To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east and the time from one sunrise to the next would be 116.75 Earth days (making the Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury&apos;s 176 Earth days).

The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun&apos;s gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.

As it does so, it changes from the &quot; Evening Star &quot;, visible after sunset, to the &quot; Morning Star &quot;, visible before sunrise. While Mercury, the other inferior planet, reaches a maximum elongation of only 28° and is often difficult to discern in twilight, Venus is hard to miss when it is at its brightest.

It shows a larger &quot; quarter phase &quot; when it is at its maximum elongations from the Sun, and is at its brightest in the night sky, and presents a much larger &quot; thin crescent &quot; in telescopic views as it comes around to the near side between the Earth and the Sun. Venus is at its largest and presents its &quot; new phase &quot; when it is between the Earth and the Sun. Its atmosphere can be seen in a telescope by the halo of light refracted around the planet. The Venusian orbit is slightly inclined relative to the Earth&apos;s orbit; thus, when the planet passes between the Earth and the Sun, it usually does not cross the face of the Sun. Transits of Venus do occur when the planet&apos;s inferior conjunction coincides with its presence in the plane of the Earth&apos;s orbit. Transits of Venus occur in cycles of 243 years with the current pattern of transits being pairs of transits separated by eight years, at intervals of about 105.5 years or 121.5 years—a pattern first discovered in 1639 by English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks.

The first claimed observation of ashen light was made as long ago as 1643, but the existence of the illumination has never been reliably confirmed.

The probes were strengthened to improve their crush depth to 25  bar and were equipped with smaller parachutes to achieve a faster descent. Since then-current atmospheric models of Venus suggested a surface pressure of between 75 and 100  bar, neither was expected to survive to the surface. After returning atmospheric data for a little over 50 minutes, they both were crushed at altitudes of approximately 20  km before going on to strike the surface on the night side of Venus. [ Surface and atmospheric science ] { Pioneer Venus orbiter } Venera 7 represented an effort to return data from the planet&apos;s surface, and was constructed with a reinforced descent module capable of withstanding a pressure of 180  bar. The module was precooled before entry and equipped with a specially reefed parachute for a rapid 35-minute descent. While entering the atmosphere on December 15, 1970, the parachute is believed to have partially torn, and the probe struck the surface with a hard, yet not fatal, impact.

Both Venera 13 and 14 analyzed soil samples with an on-board X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, and attempted to measure the compressibility of the soil with an impact probe. Venera 14, though, had the misfortune to strike its own ejected camera lens cap and its probe failed to contact the soil. The Venera program came to a close in October 1983, when Venera 15 and Venera 16 were placed in orbit to conduct mapping of the Venusian terrain with synthetic aperture radar.
