[ Organ donor the song by DJ Shadow Endtroducing..... ] Organ donation is the donation of biological tissue or an organ of the human body, from a living or dead person to a living recipient in need of a transplantation. Transplantable organs and tissues are removed in a surgical procedure following a determination, based on the donor&apos;s medical and social history, of which are suitable for transplantation. Such procedures are termed allotransplantation s, to distinguish them from xenotransplantation, the transfer of animal organs into human bodies. [ Donation after death ] As recently as the late 1960s and early 1980s, irreversible cardiopulmonary failure was the only standard for determining death for purposes of donation after cardiac death. [ http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2011spring/article5.html When Are You Dead? John Sanford Stanford University School of Medicine Spring 2011 2011-03-31 ] This was replaced by brain death, the irreversible loss of all function, including the brain stem, though donation after cardiac death is a resurgent source for transplantation. [ Legislation ] The laws of different countries allow potential donors to permit or refuse donation, or give this choice to relatives. The frequency of donations varies among countries. [ Opt-in vs. opt-out ] [ Mandated choice ] There are two main systems for voluntary systems: &quot; opt in &quot; (anyone who has not given consent is not a donor) and &quot; opt out &quot; (anyone who has not refused is a donor). In some systems like in Australia (14.9 donors per million, 337 donors in 2011), family members are required to give consent or refusal, or may veto a potential recovery even if the donor has consented. Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase effective rates of consent for donation. [ http://webs.wofford.edu/pechwj/Do%20Defaults%20Save%20Lives.pdf &quot; Do defaults save lives? &quot; SCIENCE vol.302 PDF 2012-05-19 ] However, because of cultural and infrastructural factors, public policies and other factors, this does not translate directly into increased rates of donation. Some countries with an opt-out system like Spain (34 donors per million inhabitants) or Austria (21 donors/million) have high donor rates and some countries with opt-in systems like Germany (16 donors/million) or Greece (six donors/million) have lower rates. However Sweden, which has an opt-out system, has a low rate as well (15 donors/million). Health authorities in Sweden have suggested that the government pay 30,000 - 40,000 Kronor for funeral costs if a person donates their organs.

Each state&apos;s Uniform Anatomical Gift Act seeks to streamline the process and standardize the rules among the various states. Many states have sought to encourage the donations to be made by allowing the consent to be noted on the driver&apos;s license. Donor registries allow for a central information center for an individual&apos;s wish to be a donor. It is a pure consent system rather than an extended consent system or a dissent opt-out system. The issue of consent is pressing, as the number of patients on the waiting list in the country has increased from approximately 20,000 in 1990 to over 100,000 in 2010. Alongside absolute organ donation increases from the late 1980s up until the mid-2000s, donation rates did not increase or decrease significantly from 2004-2010.

[ March 2011 ] Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) has become one of the most active organ donor hospitals in all of Germany, which otherwise has one of the lowest organ donation participation rates in the Eurotransplant organ network. LRMC, the largest U.S. military hospital outside the United States, is one of the top hospitals for organ donation in the Rhineland-Palatinate state of Germany, even though it has relatively few beds compared to many German hospitals. According to the German organ transplantation organization, Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation (DSO), 34 American military service members who died at LRMC (roughly half of the total number who died there) donated a total of 142 organs between 2005 and 2010. In 2010 alone, 10 of the 12 American service members who died at LRMC were donors, donating a total of 45 organs. Of the 205 hospitals in the DSO’s central region—which includes the large cities of Frankfurt and Mainz —only six had more organ donors than LRMC in 2010.

Organ donation in Japan is regulated by a 1997 organ transplant law, which defines &quot; brain death &quot; and legalized organ procurement from brain dead donors. [ India ] Organ selling is legally banned in India. Numerous studies have documented that organ vendors have a poor quality of life (QOL) following kidney donation.

In contrast the USA — which practices an &quot; opt in &quot; consent law where their citizens provide express and informed agreement to donate organs and tissues in the event of their death — is also in the top five ahead of many other countries that are &quot; opt in &quot;. This illustrates that there are many other factors beside legislation that affect donor rates internationally, including hospital processes, public awareness, religion and culture, and road death toll rates, and goes some way to help explain why rates are so low. [ February 2012 ] [ February 2012 ] [ Bioethical issues ] [ Deontological issues ] Certain groups, like the Roma (gypsies), oppose organ donation on religious grounds, but most [ http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2001/05/Organ-Donation-Where-Your-Religion-Stands.aspx?p%3D1 BeliefNet 17 December 2011 Organ Donation: Where Your Religion Stands ] of the world&apos;s religions support donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community. Issues surrounding patient autonomy, living will s, and guardianship make it nearly impossible for involuntary organ donation to occur. From the standpoint of deontological ethics, the primary issues surrounding the morality of organ donation are semantical in nature. The debate over the definitions of life, death, human, and body is ongoing. For example, whether or not a brain-dead patient ought to be kept artificially animate in order to preserve organs for procurement is an ongoing problem in clinical bioethics. Further, the use of cloning to produce organs with an identical genotype to the recipient has issues all its own. Cloning is still a controversial topic, especially considering the possibility for an entire person to be brought into being with the express purpose of being destroyed for organ procurement. [ July 2007 ] While the benefit of such a cloned organ would be a zero-percent chance [ August 2009 ] of transplant rejection, the ethical issues involved with creating and killing a clone may outweigh these benefits. However, it may be possible in the future to use cloned stem-cells to grow a new organ without creating a new human being. A relatively new field of transplantation has reinvigorated the debate. Xenotransplantation, or the transfer of animal (usually pig) organs into human bodies, promises to eliminate many of the ethical issues, while creating many of its own. [ March 2011 ] While xenotransplantation promises to increase the supply of organs considerably, the threat of organ transplant rejection and the risk of xenozoonosis, coupled with general anathema to the idea, decreases the functionality of the technique. Some animal rights groups oppose the sacrifice of an animal for organ donation and have launched campaigns to ban them. [ Teleological issues ] [ February 2012 ] On teleological or utilitarian grounds, the moral status of &quot; black market organ donation &quot; relies upon the ends, rather than the means. [ February 2012 ] In so far as those who donate organs are often impoverished [ March 2011 ] and those who can afford black market organs are typically well-off, [ February 2012 ] it would appear that there is an imbalance in the trade. In many cases, those in need of organs are put on waiting lists for legal organs for indeterminate lengths of time — many die while still on a waiting list. Organ donation is fast becoming an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, the fact remains that demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. [ March 2011 ] The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice on the one hand and a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not.

Opponents say that such a market would encourage criminals by making it easier for them to claim that their stolen organs were legal. Legalization of the organ trade carries with it its own sense of justice as well. Continuing black-market trade creates further disparity on the demand side: only the rich can afford such organs. Legalization of the international organ trade could lead to increased supply, lowering prices so that persons outside the wealthiest segments could afford such organs as well. Exploitation arguments generally come from two main areas: [ Scott Carney http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_prices Why a Kidney (Street Value: $3,000) Sells for $85,000 Wired.com 2007 2011-03-31 2007-05-08 ] [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111200375.html The Washington Post Poor Pakistanis Donate Kidneys for Money Sadaqat Jan 2010-05-20 2006-11-12 ] [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/6090468.stm BBC News Iran&apos;s desperate kidney traders 31 October 2006 2010-05-20 Nima Sarvestani ] [ http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/288/13/1589 Economic and Health Consequences of Selling a Kidney in India, October 2, 2002, Goyal et al. 288 (13): 1589 Journal of the American Medical Association 2002-10-02 2011-03-31 ] [ Scott Carney http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_rani Inside &apos;Kidneyville&apos;: Rani&apos;s Story Wired.com 2007 2011-03-31 2007-05-08 ] [ March 2011 ] Physical exploitation suggests that the operations in question are quite risky, and, taking place in third-world hospitals or &quot; back-alleys, &quot; even more risky. Yet, if the operations in question can be made safe, there is little threat to the donor. Financial exploitation suggests that the donor (especially in the India n subcontinent and Africa ) are not paid enough. Commonly, accounts from persons who have sold organs in both legal and black market circumstances put the prices at between $150 and $5,000, depending on the local laws, supply of ready donors and scope of the transplant operation. In Chennai, India where one of the largest black markets for organs is known to exist, studies have placed the average sale price at little over $1,000. Many accounts also exist of donors being postoperatively denied their promised pay. The New Cannibalism is a phrase coined by anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes in 1998 for an article written for The New Internationalist. Her argument was that the actual exploitation is an ethical failing, a human exploitation; a perception of the poor as organ sources which may be used to extend the lives of the wealthy. The New Cannibalism Economic drivers leading to increased donation are not limited to areas such as India and Africa, but also are emerging in the United States. Increasing funeral expenses combined with decreasing real value of investments such as homes and retirement savings which took place in the 2000s have purportedly led to an increase in citizens taking advantage of arrangements where funeral costs are reduced or eliminated.

Most organ donation for organ transplantation is done in the setting of brain death. In some nations (for instance, Belgium, Poland, Portugal and France ) everyone is automatically an organ donor, although some jurisdictions (such as Singapore, Poland, France, or New Zealand ) allow opting out of the system. Elsewhere, consent from family members or next-of-kin is required for organ donation. The non-living donor is kept on ventilator support until the organs have been surgically removed. If a brain-dead individual is not an organ donor, ventilator and drug support is discontinued and cardiac death is allowed to occur. [ right In order to be dead enough to bury but alive enough to be a donor, you must be irreversibly brain dead. If it’s reversible, you’re no longer dead; you’re a patient. And once you start messing around with this definition, you’re on a slippery slope, and the question then becomes: How dead do you want patients to be before you start taking their organs? David Crippen, M.D., a critical care specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ] In the United States, where since the 1980s the Uniform Determination of Death Act has defined death as the irreversible cessation of the function of either the brain or the heart and lungs, the 21st century has seen an order-of-magnitude increase of donation following cardiac death. In 1995, only one out of 100 dead donors in the nation gave their organs following the declaration of cardiac death. That figure grew to almost 11 percent in 2008, according to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. That increase has provoked ethical concerns about the interpretation of &quot; irreversible &quot; since &quot; patients may still be alive five or even 10 minutes after cardiac arrest because, theoretically, their hearts could be restarted, [and thus are] clearly not dead because their condition was reversible. &quot; [ Political issues ] There are also controversial issues regarding how organs are allocated to recipients. For example, some believe that livers should not be given to alcoholics in danger of reversion, while others view alcoholism as a medical condition like diabetes. [ March 2011 ] Faith in the medical system is important to the success of organ donation. Brazil switched to an opt-out system and ultimately had to withdraw it because it further alienated patients who already distrusted the country&apos;s medical system. [ http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/may/consent.doc Time to move to presumed consent for organ donation BMJ Publishing Group Press Release ] Adequate funding, strong political will to see transplant outcomes improve, and the existence of specialized training, care and facilities also increase donation rates. Expansive legal definitions of death, such as Spain uses, also increase the pool of eligible donors by allowing physicians to declare a patient to be dead at an earlier stage, when the organs are still in good physical condition. Allowing or forbidding payment for organs affects the availability of organs. Generally, where organs can not be bought or sold, quality and safety are high, but supply is not adequate to the demand. Where organs can be purchased, the supply increase somewhat, [ March 2011 ] but safety declines, as families and living donors have an incentive to conceal unfavorable information. Healthy humans have two kidneys, a redundancy that enables living donors ( inter vivos ) to give a kidney to someone who needs it. The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. However, internet advertising for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe it undermines the traditional list-based allocation system. { Appel, Jacob. &quot; Organ Solicitation on the Internet: Every Man for Himself &quot; The Hastings Center Report. Vol 35, No 3 (May–June 2005). } The National Transplant Organization of Spain is one of the most successful in the world, but it still can&apos;t meet the demand, as 10% of those needing a transplant die while still on the transplant list. { Organización Nacional de Trasplantes } [ March 2011 ] Donations from corpses are anonymous, and a network for communication and transport allows fast extraction and transplant across the country. Under Spanish law, every corpse can provide organs unless the deceased person had expressly rejected it. Because family members still can forbid the donation, [ March 2011 ] carefully trained doctors ask the family for permission, making it very similar in practice to the United States system. [ http://www.cmaj.ca/news/29_09_03.shtml More countries hope to copy Spain&apos;s organ-donation success Canadian Medical Association 29 September 2003 2011-03-31 ] In the overwhelming majority of cases, organ donation is not possible for reasons of recipient safety, match failures, or organ condition. Even in Spain, which has the highest organ donation rate in the world, there are only 35.1 actual donors per million people, and there are hundreds of patients on the waiting list. This rate compares to 24.8 per million in Austria, where families are rarely asked to donate organs, and 22.2 per million in France, which—like Spain—has a presumed-consent system. [ Prison inmates ] In the United States, prisoners are not discriminated against as organ recipients and are equally eligible for organ transplants along with the general population. A 1976 U.S. Supreme Court case { Estelle v Gamble 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.

Orthodox Judaism considers organ donation obligatory if it will save a life, as long as the donor is considered dead as defined by Jewish law. In both Orthodox Judaism and non-Orthodox Judaism, the majority view holds that organ donation is permitted in the case of irreversible cardiac rhythm cessation. In some cases, rabbinic authorities believe that organ donation may be mandatory, whereas a minority opinion considers any donation of a live organ as forbidden. { Sinclair 2003, p.242 } [ Organ shortfall ] The demand for organs significantly surpasses the number of donors everywhere in the world. There are more potential recipients on organ donation waiting lists than organ donors. In particular, due to significant advances in dialysis techniques, patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can survive longer than ever before. Because these patients don&apos;t die as quickly as they used to, and as kidney failure increases with the rising age and prevalence of high blood pressure and diabetes in a society, the need especially for kidneys rises every year. In the United States, about 108,000 people are on the waiting list, [ http://www.unos.org/ United Network for Organ Sharing Organ Donation and Transplantation 2009-03-24 ] although about a third of those patients are inactive and could not receive a donated organ.

Three-quarters of patients in need of an organ transplant are waiting for a kidney, [ http://www.ctdn.org/resources_public.php#Statistics Resources California Transplant Donor Network 2011-03-31 ] and as such kidneys have much longer waiting times. At the Oregon Health and Science University, for example, the median patient who ultimately received an organ waited only three weeks for a heart and three months for a pancreas or liver — but 15 months for a kidney, because demand for kidneys substantially outstrips supply.

Illinois adopted a policy of “mandated choice” in 2006, which requires driver&apos;s license registrants to answer the question “Do you want to be an organ donor?” Illinois has a registration rate of 60 percent compared to 38 percent nationally. The added cost of adding a question to the registration form is minimal. monetary incentives for signing up to be a donor. Some economists have advocated going as far as allowing the sale of organs. The New York Times reported that “Gary Becker and Julio Jorge Elias argued in a recent paper that &apos;monetary incentives would increase the supply of organs for transplant sufficiently to eliminate the very large queues in organ markets, and the suffering and deaths of many of those waiting, without increasing the total cost of transplant surgery by more than 12 percent.&apos;” Iran allows the sale of kidneys, and has no waiting list. The primary argument against this proposal is a moral one; as the article notes, many find such a suggestion repugnant. As the National Kidney Foundation puts it, “Offering direct or indirect economic benefits in exchange for organ donation is inconsistent with our values as a society. Any attempt to assign a monetary value to the human body, or body parts, either arbitrarily, or through market forces, diminishes human dignity.” an opt-out system ( &quot; dissent solution &quot; ), in which a potential donor or his/her relatives must take specific action to be excluded from organ donation, rather than specific action to be included. This model is used in several European countries, such as Austria, which has a registration rate eight times that of Germany, which uses an opt-in system. social incentive programs, wherein members sign a legal agreement to direct their organs first to other members who are on the transplant waiting list. One example of a private organization using this model is LifeSharers, which is free to join and whose members agree to sign a document giving preferred access to their organs. “ &quot; The proposal [for an organ mutual insurance pool] can be easily summarized: An individual would receive priority for any needed transplant if that individual agrees that his or her organs will be available to other members of the insurance pool in the event of his or her death. … The main purpose [of this proposal] is to increase the supply of transplantable organs in order to save or improve more lives. &quot; In hospitals, organ network representatives routinely screen patient records to identify potential donors shortly in advance of their deaths. In many cases, organ-procurement representatives will request screening tests (such as blood typing ) or organ-preserving drugs (such as blood pressure drugs ) to keep potential donors&apos; organs viable until their suitability for transplants can be determined and family consent (if needed) can be obtained. This practice increases transplant efficiency, as potential donors who are unsuitable due to infection or other causes are removed from consideration before their deaths, and decreases the avoidable loss of organs. It may also benefit families indirectly, as the families of unsuitable donors are not approached to discuss organ donation. The Center for Ethical Solutions, an American bioethics think tank, is currently working on a project called &quot; Solving the Organ Shortage, &quot; in which it is studying the Iranian kidney procurement system in order to better inform the debate over solving the organ shortfall in the United States. { Solving the Organ Shortage. Center for Ethical Solutions. Retrieved on 2009-07-08. } [ Distribution ] The United States has two agencies that govern organ procurement and distribution within the country. The United Network for Organ Sharing and the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) regulate Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) with regard to procurement and distribution ethics and standards. OPOs are non-profit organizations charged with the evaluation, procurement and allocation of organs whithin their Designated Service Area (DSA). Once a donor has been evaluated and consent obtained, provisional allocation of organs commences. UNOS developed a computer program that automatically generates donor specific match lists for suitable recipients based on the criteria that the patient was listed with. OPO coordinators enter donor information into the program and run the respective lists. Organ offers to potential recipients are made to transplant centers to make them aware of a potential organ. The surgeon will evaluate the donor information and make a provisional determination of medical suitability to their recipient. Distribution varies slightly between different organs but is essentially very similar. When lists are generated many factors are taken into consideration; these factors include: distance of transplant center from the donor hospital, blood type, medical urgency, wait time, donor size and tissue typing. For heart recipients medical urgency is denoted by a recipients &quot; Status &quot; (Status 1A, 1B and status 2). Lungs are allocated based on a recipients Lung Allocation Score (LAS) that is determined based on urgency and wait time. Livers are allocated using both a status system and MELD/PELD score (Model for End-stage Liver Disease/Pediatric End-stage Liver Disease). Kidney and pancreas lists are based on location, blood type, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing and wait time. When a recipient for a kidney or pancreas has no direct antibodies to the donor HLA the match is said to be a 0 ABDR mismatch or zero antigen mismatch. A zero mismatch organ has a low rate of rejection and allows a recipient to be on lower doses of immunosuppressive drug s. Since zero mismatches have such high graft survival these recipients are afforded priority regardless of location and wait time. UNOS has in place a &quot; Payback &quot; system to balance organs that are sent out of a DSA because of a zero mismatch. Location of a transplant center with respect to a donor hospital is given priority due to the effects of Cold Ischemic Time (CIT). Once the organ is removed from the donor, blood no longer perfuses through the vessels and begins to starve the cells of oxygen ( ischemia ). Each organ tolerates different ischemic times. Hearts and lungs need to be transplanted within 4–6 hours from recovery, liver about 8–10 hours and pancreas about 15 hours; kidneys are the most resilient to ischemia. [ March 2011 ] Kidneys packaged on ice can be successfully transplanted 24–36 hours after recovery. Developments in kidney preservation have yielded a device that pumps cold preservation solution through the kidneys vessels to prevent Delayed Graft Function (DGF) due to ischemia. Perfusion devices, often called kidney pumps, can extend graft survival to 36–48 hours post recovery for kidneys. Research and development is currently underway for heart and lung preservation devices, in an effort to increase distances procurement teams may travel to recover an organ. [ Suicide ] People committing suicide have a higher rate of donating organs than average. One reason is lower negative response or refusal rate by the family and relatives, but the explanation for this remains to be clarified. In addition, donation consent is higher than average from people committing suicide. { Behavior profile of family members of donors and nondonors of organs. Moraes BN, Bacal F, Teixeira MC, Fiorelli AI, Leite PL, Fiorelli LR, Stolf NA, Bocchi EA.

Brain death may result in legal death, but still with the heart beating, and with mechanical ventilation all other vital organs may be kept completely alive and functional, providing optimal opportunities for organ transplantation. [ Scandals ] In 2008, California transplant surgeon Hootan Roozrokh was charged with dependent adult abuse for prescribing what prosecutors said were excessive doses of morphine and sedatives to hasten the death of a man with adrenal leukodystrophy and irreversible brain damage, in order to procure his organs for transplant.

In September 1999, eBay blocked an auction for “one functional human kidney” which had reached a highest bid of $5.7 million.
