[ Biography ] Born in Aarberg, Switzerland, Wüthrich was educated in chemistry, physics, and mathematics at the University of Berne before pursuing his Ph.D. under the direction of Silvio Fallab at the University of Basel, awarded in 1964. He continued post-doctoral work with Fallab for a short time before leaving to work at the University of California, Berkeley for two years from 1965 with Robert E. Connick. That was followed by a stint working with Robert G. Shulman at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey from 1967 to 1969. Wüthrich returned to Switzerland, to Zürich, in 1969, where he began his career there at the ETH Zürich, rising to Professor of Biophysics by 1980. He currently maintains a laboratory both at the ETH Zürich and at The Scripps Research Institute, in La Jolla, California. [ Career ] During his graduate studies Wüthrich started out working with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and the subject of his Ph. D thesis was &quot; the catalytic activity of copper compounds in autoxidation reactions &quot;. During his time as a postdoc in Berkeley he began working with the newly developed and related technique of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the hydration of metal complexes. When Wüthrich joined the Bell Labs, he was put in charge of one of the first superconducting NMR spectrometers, and started studying the structure and dynamics of proteins. He has pursued this line of research ever since. After returning to Switzerland, Wüthrich collabrated with among others nobel laureate Richard R. Ernst on developing the first 2 dimensional NMR experiments, and established the nuclear Overhauser effect as a convenient way of measuring distances within proteins. This research later led to the complete assignment of resonances for among others the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and glucagon. He was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1991 and half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002 for &quot; his development of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules in solution &quot;. He taught at Duke University as Handler Memorial Lecturer in 2007. In October 2010, Wuthrich participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival &apos;s Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students will get to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize winning Scientist over a brown bag lunch. { Usasciencefestival.org } Wuthrich is also a member on the USA Science and Engineering Festival &apos;s Advisory Board. { Usasciencefestival.org } [ See also ] Water (2006 film) [ References ] [ External links ] Kurt Wuthrich faculty page at ETH Zürich &apos;An Interview with Kurt Wuthrich Freeview video by the Vega Science Trust Computer Aided Resonance Assignment (CARA), freeware developed in the group of Kurt Wuthrich at the ETH Zürich Wuthrich Nobel Prize Lecture The Official Site of Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize The Scripps Research Institute -- Faculty Profile: Kurt Wuthrich [ Wuthrich, Kurt Swiss chemist October 4, 1938 Aarberg, Switzerland ] Category:1938 births Category:Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization Category:Living people Category:People from Aarberg Category:ETH Zurich faculty Category:Duke University faculty Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry Category:Nuclear magnetic resonance Category:Swiss chemists Category:Swiss Nobel laureates Category:The Scripps Research Institute faculty Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences ar:كورت فوتريخ ca:Kurt Wüthrich de:Kurt Wüthrich et:Kurt Wüthrich es:Kurt Wüthrich fa:کورت ووتریش fr:Kurt Wüthrich gd:Kurt Wüthrich gl:Kurt Wüthrich ko:쿠르트 뷔트리히 io:Kurt Wüthrich id:Kurt Wüthrich it:Kurt Wüthrich sw:Kurt Wüthrich nl:Kurt Wüthrich ja:クルト・ヴュートリッヒ no:Kurt Wüthrich oc:Kurt Wüthrich pnb:کرت ورتھریچ nds:Kurt Wüthrich pl:Kurt Wüthrich pt:Kurt Wüthrich ro:Kurt Wüthrich ru:Вютрих, Курт sk:Kurt Wüthrich sr:Курт Витрих fi:Kurt Wüthrich sv:Kurt Wüthrich ta:குர்த் வியூத்ரிச் uk:Курт Вютріх yo:Kurt Wüthrich zh:库尔特·维特里希
