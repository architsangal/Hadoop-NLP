[ Railways in Gabon ] thumb Until the 1970s, Gabon had no railroads. A 936  km railroad construction program, the Trans-Gabon Railway, began in October 1974. In its first stage, completed in 1983, the project linked the port of Owendo with the interior city of Booué (332  km). The second stage, completed in December 1986, linked Booué with Franceville (357  km) via Moanda, thus facilitating exports of manganese from the southeast and forestry exploitation in the same region. A proposed third stage would continue the line from Booué to Belinga in the northeast, where there are iron ore deposits. In 2003 the railway began the process of installing a satellite based telecommunications system. { Railway telecom system 2003 } As of 2004, Gabon State Railways totalled 814  km of standard-gauge track. total:814  km ( Gabon State Railways or OCTRA) standard gauge:814  km 1.435-m gauge; single track (1994) [ Railway links with adjacent states ] [ Equatorial Guinea ] [ Cameroon ] [ 1435 ] [ 1000 ] [ Republic of the Congo ] [ 1435 ] [ 1067 ] Equatorial Guinea - no - no railways Cameroon - no - break of gauge / Republic of the Congo - no - break of gauge / [ Maps ] UN Map - shows line to Franceville UNHCR map - does not show line to Franceville TravelPortal map - shows major rivers UNJLC Rail map of Southern Africa - does not show line to Franceville [ Cities served by rail ] [ Railway stations in Gabon ] Existing Libreville - capital Owendo - port Sahoué - port Franceville - railhead Ndjolé Lopé Booué - likely junction for branchline to Makokou Lastoursville Moanda Ntoum - proposed junction for iron ore traffic to Santa Clara Kango Four-Place Mounana - ?

In 2002, the road network comprised 8,454  km, of which 838  kmwere paved, including 30  km of expressways. A north-south road runs the length of the country, from Bitam to Ndendé. This main north-south link continues into Cameroon in the north and the Congo in the south. An east–west road connects Libreville and Mékambo. Farther south, another road runs from Mayumba to Lastoursville and Franceville. In 1995 there were about 23,000 automobiles and 10,000 commercial vehicles in use. total:7,670  km paved:629  km (including 30  km of expressways) unpaved:7,041  km (1996 est.) Roads in Gabon link most areas of the country, and many of the main roads are of a reasonable standard. However, remoter areas along the coast and in the east are often not connected to the road network. Major roads are denoted national route s and numbered, with a prefix &quot; N &quot; (sometimes &quot; RN &quot; ): N1 road : Libreville – Kougouleu – Bifoun – Lambaréné – Mouila – Ndendé – Tchibanga - ( Congo-Brazzaville ) N2 road : Bifoun – Alembe – Viate – Mitzic – Bibasse – Oyem – Bitam – Éboro – ( Cameroon ) N3 road : Alembe – Kazamabika – Lastoursville – Moanda – Franceville N4 road : Viate – Ekonlong – Makokou – Mékambo N5 road : Kougouleu – Bibasse N6 road : Mayumba – Tchibanga – Ndendé – Lebamba - Koulamoutou – Lastoursville [ Water transport ] [ Seaports and harbours ] The busiest ports are Port-Gentil, the center for exports of petroleum products and imports of mining equipment, and Owendo, a new port that opened in 1974 on the Ogooué estuary, 10  km north of Libreville. Owendo’s capacity, initially 300,000 tons, reached 1.5 million tons in 1979, when the port was enlarged to include timber-handling facilities. The smaller port at Mayumba also handles timber, and a deepwater port is planned for the city. [ Merchant marine ] In 1998, Gabon’s merchant marine owned two vessels totalling 13,613 GRT. As of 2002, there was one merchant marine. As of 2003, Gabon had 1,600  km of perennially navigable waterways, including 310  km on the Ogooué River. total:1 ship (with a volume of [ 1,000 yes ] or over) totaling [ 2,419 ] / [ 3,205 metric yes ] ships by type: cargo ship 1 (1999 est.) [ Waterways ] Gabon has 1,600  km of perennially navigable waterways [ Air transport ] Gabon had an estimated 56 airports in 2004, but only 11 of which had paved runways as of 2005. There are three international airports: Libreville (Leon M’Ba), Port-Gentil, and Franceville. Numerous airlines provide international flights. Air Affaires Gabon handles scheduled domestic service. In 2003, about 386,000 passengers were carried on scheduled domestic and international airline flights.
