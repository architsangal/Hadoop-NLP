[ ABV ] { absinthe. } Alcohol by volume (abbreviated as abv, ABV, or alc/vol) is a standard measure of how much alcohol ( ethanol ) is contained in an alcoholic beverage (expressed as a percentage of total volume ).

In some countries, alcohol by volume is referred to as degrees Gay-Lussac (after the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac ).

Berry, 1987, First Steps in Winemaking, eighth edition, Special Interest Model Books Ltd, printed in UK } [ The Joy of Mixology Regan Gary 2003 Clarkson Potter New York 0-609-60884-3 356–357 ] while in the United Kingdom it was 1.75 times the number (expressed as a percentage). For example, 40% abv is 80 proof in the US and 70 proof in the UK. However, since 1980, alcoholic proof in the UK has been replaced by abv as a measure of alcohol content. [ Proof and alcohol by weight ] In the United States, a few states regulate and tax alcoholic beverages according to alcohol by weight (abw), expressed as a percentage of total mass. Some brewers print the abw (rather than the abv) on beer containers, particularly on low-point versions of popular domestic beer brands. At relatively low abv, the alcohol percentage by weight is about 4/5 of the abv (e.g., 3.2% abw is equivalent to 4.0% abv). [ http://www.realbeer.com/library/beerbreak/archives/beerbreak20001005.php Realbeer.com: Beer Break - Alcohol Content In Beer www.realbeer.com 2008-07-05 ] However, because of the miscibility of alcohol and water, the conversion factor is not constant but rather depends upon the concentration of alcohol. 100% abw, of course, is equivalent to 100% abv. [ Calculation of alcohol content ] During the production of wine and beer, yeast is added to a sugary solution. During fermentation, the yeast organisms consume the sugars and produce alcohol. The density of sugar in water is greater than the density of alcohol in water. A hydrometer is used to measure the change in specific gravity (SG) of the solution before and after fermentation. The volume of alcohol in the solution can then be calculated. [ Wine ] The simplest method for wine has been described by English author C.J.J. Berry : { C.J.J. Berry, 1987, First Steps in Winemaking, eighth edition, Special Interest Model Books Ltd, printed in UK } ABV = (Starting SG - Final SG)/7.36 [ Beer ] [ Beer_measurement#By_strength ] The calculation for beer is: Where 1.05 is number of grams of ethanol produced for every gram of CO 2 produced and.79 is the density of ethanol, ABV = ((1.05 * (Starting SG – Final SG)) / Final SG) / 0.79 * 100 Anon, 2012, Industrial Microbiology Beer Fermentation Practical, School Of Applied Sciences, RMIT University, Melbourne However, many brewers use the following formula: ABV = (Starting SG - Final SG) * 131 [ See also ] Alcohol proof Unit of alcohol Apparent molar property [ References ] [ Bibliography ] [ Hehner, Otto Alcohol Tables: giving for all specific gravities, from 1.0000 to 0.7938, the percentages of absolute alcohol, by weight and volume London J &amp; amp; A Churchill, ASIN B0008B5HOU 1880 ] [ External links ] How do brewers measure the alcohol in beer?
