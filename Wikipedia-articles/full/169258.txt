Mecano in 1989 [ the construction toy Meccano ] [ Mecano group_or_band Madrid, Spain Synthpop New Wave Pop rock 1981–1992, 1998, 2012 CBS, Sony BMG Ana Torroja Nacho Cano José María Cano ] Mecano was a Spanish pop band formed in the early 1980s, active until 1992, and which had a brief comeback in 1998. The band&apos;s lineup was singer Ana Torroja and brothers Nacho and José María Cano, who worked alongside session musicians such as Arturo Terriza, Manolo Aguilar, Nacho Mañó, Javier Quílez, Ángel Celada and Óscar Astruga. The trio&apos;s musical career spanned two distinct stages. The first, up to 1985, was essentially as a synthpop band; while on the second stage Mecano followed a more acoustic pop rock direction, with elements of ballad, salsa, rumba, bolero, paso doble, flamenco, bossanova, tango, dance and even reggae. They were considered by some to be avant-garde for their time. [ Billboard http://www.billboard.com/artist/mecano/bio/25016#%2Fartist%2Fmecano%2Fbio%2F25016 15 May 2012 ] Mecano is still the best-selling Spanish band to this date, reaching over 25 million albums worldwide [ Grupo Mecano http://www.grupomecano.com/historia.php 15 May 2012 ]. The unprecedented success also hit Latin America. Also, thanks to adaptations to other languages ​​of several of their songs, they had an impact on non-Spanish speaking countries such as Italy and France, as with their «Une femme avec une femme». That foreign song remains to this date the one which has been for the most weeks has been at the top of the French charts. [ History ] The band started as a synth-pop ensemble (tecno pop in Spanish) by brothers Nacho and José María Cano, along with singer Ana Torroja, in 1981 in Madrid. In a period of cultural experimentation in the newly democratic Spain, Mecano achieved its initial popularity with their debut single, «Hoy no me puedo levantar» («I Can&apos;t Get Up Today»), a song about youth boredom and hangovers. Their first, self-titled album became a collection of classics that would later represent Spanish 1980s pop music. At the same time, Nacho Cano branched out into producing other bands, and both brothers started writing songs for other pop up-and-comers. Although those secondary acts wouldn&apos;t achieve the level of success Mecano gained, they turned out to be new testing grounds for Mecano. Having achieved another huge hit in 1986 with «Me cuesta tanto olvidarte» («It&apos;s So Hard to Forget You»), the band reformed its musical approach with the album Entre el cielo y el suelo (Between Heaven and Earth). Their new style emphasized pop over techno. It also facilitated the export of their music to Latin America. This new versatility was evidenced by « Hijo de la Luna » («Son of the Moon»). This song was also submitted by the band as a potential Eurovision Song Contest contestant that year, but TVE selected another band, Cadillac. Their follow-up album, Descanso dominical (Sunday Rest), produced two of their most popular singles: «La fuerza del destino» («The force of fate») and «Mujer contra mujer» («Woman against woman»). The latter is about a lesbian relationship, seen through the eyes of a friend, who only later realizes what is going on. It was recorded in French (« Une femme avec une femme »), English and Italian, giving Mecano their first truly global hit. Aidalai ( nonsense word meaning, &quot; Oh, Dalai (Lama) &quot; ), their following album, was published in 1991 and was as successful as their previous two works. In 1993 the band announced a &quot; temporary hiatus &quot;. The songs La fuerza del destino and «El 7 de septiembre» («September 7») were dedicated to Coloma Fernández Armero, who was Nacho Cano&apos;s girlfriend for several years. Actress Penélope Cruz debuted in the video clip for La fuerza del destino. She later had a relationship with Nacho Cano for several years. In 1998 the band released the album Ana, Jose, Nacho, which mixed new songs with greatest hits. The band separated later that year and all three members went on to have solo careers, though only Ana found success as a singer. In 2005 keyboardist Nacho Cano wrote a musical based on 32 Mecano songs, named after their first single. In 2005, the members of Mecano released a double-CD/DVD package commemorating the 25th anniversary of the creation of the band. The new CD/DVD, Mecanografia (Mecano-graphy), includes a compilation of all their singles, never-before released songs, and a DVD with videos and early concert appearances. The Cano brothers were innovative musicians in the use of technology, and Nacho was one of the first Spanish musicians to own a Fairlight keyboard. (Its screen can be seen in the back cover of their only live album). Jose Maria also commented that he often locked himself in a room with a dictionary and books to write his songs, while Nacho has said that to compose he started off with a rhythm machine, then added the melody, and the lyrics came in last. In November 2009 the band reunited with a new song to be released later that month. On November 25, 2011 the journalist José Antonio Abellán announces their reunion in ABC Punto Radio for a world tour in 2012.
