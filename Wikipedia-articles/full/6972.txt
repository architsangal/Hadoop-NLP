[ Chipmunk (disambiguation) ] [ October 2008 ] [ Chipmunks Early Miocene to Recent Tamias minimus.jpg Least chipmunk Animal ia Chordata Mammal ia Rodent ia Sciuromorpha Sciuridae Marmotini Tamiina Tamias Illiger, 1811 Subgenera 3, see text ] Chipmunks are small, striped squirrel s. All species of chipmunks are found in North America, with the exception of the Siberian chipmunk, which is found in Asia. [ Etymology and taxonomy ] Chipmunks may be classified either as a single genus, Tamias, or as three genera: Tamias, which includes the eastern chipmunk; Eutamias, which includes the Siberian chipmunk; and Neotamias, which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western, species. These classifications are arbitrary, and most taxonomies [ November 2010 ] over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks in a single genus. However, studies of mitochondrial DNA show that the divergence between each of the three chipmunk groups is comparable to the genetic dissimilarity between Marmot a and Spermophilus.

[ John O. Whitaker, Jr. Robert Elman The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals 2nd edition 1980 Knopf New York 0-394-50762-2 370 ] The common name originally may have been spelled &quot; chitmunk, &quot; from the native Odawa (Ottawa) word jidmoonh, meaning &quot; red squirrel &quot; (cf. Ojibwe, ajidamoo) { http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=chipmunk. } The earliest form cited in the Oxford English Dictionary (from 1842) is &quot; chipmonk, &quot; but &quot; chipmunk &quot; appears in several books from the 1820s and 1830s. { Google Books } Other early forms include &quot; chipmuck &quot; and &quot; chipminck, &quot; and in the 1830s they were also referred to as &quot; chip squirrels, &quot; probably in reference to the sound they make. In the mid-1800s, John James Audubon and his sons included a lithograph of the chipmunk in their Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America, calling it the &quot; Chipping Squirrel [or] Hackee. &quot; [ Audubon John James Bachman John Imperial Collection of Audubon Mammals Bonanza Books, a division of Crown Publishing Group 1967 New York 52 ] Chipmunks have also been referred to as &quot; striped squirrels, &quot; &quot; chippers, &quot; &quot; munks, &quot; &quot; timber tigers, &quot; or &quot; ground squirrels, &quot; although the name &quot; ground squirrel &quot; usually refers to other squirrels, such as those of the genus Spermophilus. [ Diet ] Chipmunks have an omnivorous diet consisting of grain, nuts, fruit, berries, birds&apos; eggs, small frogs, fungi, worms, insects and on occasions small mammals like young mice. { Eastern Chipmunk - Tamias striatus - NatureWorks } At the beginning of autumn, many species of chipmunk begin to stockpile these goods in their burrows, for winter. Other species make multiple small caches of food. These two kinds of behavior are called larder hoarding and scatter hoarding. Larder hoarders usually live in their nests until spring. Cheek pouches allow chipmunks to carry multiple food items to their burrows for either storage or consumption. { West Virginia Wildlife Magazine: Wildlife Diversity Notebook. Eastern chipmunk } [ Ecology and life history ] Eastern chipmunks mate in early spring and again in early summer, producing litters of four or five young twice each year. [ Hazard Evan B.

The young emerge from the burrow after about six weeks and strike out on their own within the next two weeks. [ Schwartz Charles Walsh Elizabeth Reeder Schwartz, Jerry J. Conley The Wild Mammals of Missouri University of Missouri Press 2001 135–140 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DuEWl0ZM6DfUC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA140%26amp%3Bdq%3Deastern%2Bchipmunk%2Byoung#PPA140%2CM1 0-8262-1359-6 ] These small mammals fulfill several important functions in forest ecosystem s. Their activities harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role in seedling establishment. They consume many different kinds of fungi, including those involved in symbiotic mycorrhizal associations with trees, and are an important vector for dispersal of the spores of subterranean sporocarps (truffles) which have co-evolved with these and other mycophagous mammals and thus lost the ability to disperse their spores through the air. [ Apostol Dean Marcia Sinclair Restoring the Pacific Northwest: The Art and Science of Ecological Restoration in Cascadia Island Press 2006 112 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DCsGyhzFBjyAC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA112%26amp%3Bdq%3Dchipmunk%2Bsporocarps 1-55963-078-7 ] Chipmunks construct expansive burrow s which can be more than 3.5 m in length with several well-concealed entrances. The sleeping quarters are kept extremely clean as shells and feces are stored in refuse tunnels. Chipmunks play an important role as prey for various predatory mammals and birds, but are also opportunistic predators themselves, particularly with regard to bird eggs and nestling s. In Oregon, mountain bluebird s (Siala currucoides) have been observed energetically mobbing chipmunks that they see near their nest trees. [ June 2009 ] Chipmunks typically live about three years, although have been observed living to nine years in captivity. { Information on Chipmunks http://www.essortment.com/information-chipmunks-56048.html } Chipmunks in captivity are said to sleep for an average of about 15 hours a day. It is thought that mammals which can sleep in hiding, such as rodents and bats, tend to sleep longer than those that must remain on alert. { &quot; 40 Winks? &quot; Jennifer S.
