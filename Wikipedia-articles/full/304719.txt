[ List of Chinese classifiers ] [ General classifier gè, the most common Mandarin classifier Unicode4E2A.svg 148 The character 个 simplified Unicode500B.svg 140 The character 個 traditional ] In the modern Chinese language s, words known as classifier s or measure word s ( [ 量詞 量词 liàngcí ] ) are used along with numbers to define the quantity of a given object, or with demonstrative s such as &quot; this &quot; and &quot; that &quot; to identify specific objects. Classifiers are bound morpheme s : they do not have any meaning by themselves and are always used in conjunction with a noun or another content word. Whenever a noun is preceded by a number or a demonstrative, a classifier must come in between. The choice whether to use a number or demonstrative at all, however, is up to the speaker; classifiers may often be avoided by simply using a bare noun. Phrases consisting of a number, a classifier, and a noun, such as [ 个 ] { 人 }  (yí ge rén, one- [ CL ] person), are known as &quot; classifier phrases &quot;. Some linguists have proposed that the use of classifier phrases may be guided less by grammar and more by stylistic or pragmatic concerns on the part of a speaker who may be trying to foreground new or important information. Finally, in addition to these uses, classifiers may be used in variant ways: when placed after a noun rather than before it, or when repeated, a classifier signifies a plural or indefinite quantity. Most nouns have one or more particular classifiers associated with them. For example, many flat objects such as tables, papers, beds, and benches use the classifier [ zh 张 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 張 ] )  zhāng, whereas many long and thin objects use [ zh 条 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 條 ] )  tiáo. The way speakers choose which classifiers to use—and thus, by extension, how nouns are categorized—has been the subject of debate. Some propose that classifier–noun pairings are based on innate semantic features of the noun (for example, all &quot; long &quot; nouns take a certain classifier because of their inherent longness), and others claim that they are motivated by analogy to more prototypical pairings (for example, &quot; dictionary &quot; takes the same classifier as the more common word &quot; book &quot; ). In addition to these specific classifiers, there is a general classifier [ zh 个 ] ( [ zh 個 ] ), pronounced gè in Mandarin, that may often (but not always) be used in place of other classifiers; in informal and spoken language, native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other, even though they know which classifier is &quot; correct &quot; when asked. Finally, Chinese also has mass-classifiers, or words that are not specific to any one object; for example, the mass-classifier [ zh 盒 ]  (hé, box) may be used with boxes of objects, such as lightbulbs or books, even though those nouns also have their own special classifiers. In all, Chinese has anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred classifiers, depending on how they are counted; there is also variation in which classifiers are paired to which nouns, with speakers of different dialects often using different classifiers for the same item. Many languages close to Chinese exhibit similar classifier systems, leading to speculation about the origins of the Chinese system. Ancient classifier-like constructions, which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier, are attested in Chinese as early as 1400 BCE, but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases until much later. Originally, classifiers and numbers came after the noun rather than before, and probably moved before the noun sometime after 500 BCE. The use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of Chinese grammar until around 1100 CE. Some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others, the earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems. Many words that are classifiers today started out as full nouns, and their meanings were gradually bleached away until they could only be used as classifiers. [ Usage ] In Chinese, a numeral cannot quantify a noun by itself; instead, the language relies on classifier s, commonly referred to as measure word s. { Across different } { varieties of Chinese, classifier-noun clauses have slightly different interpretations (particularly in the interpretation of } { definiteness in classified nouns as opposed to bare nouns), but the requirement that a classifier come between a number and a noun is more or less the same in the major varieties } [ Cheng Sybesma 2005 ] {. } When a noun is preceded by a number, a demonstrative such as this or that, or a quantifier such as every, a classifier mandatorily appears directly before the noun. [ Li Thompson 1981 104 ] Thus, while English speakers say &quot; one person &quot; or &quot; this person &quot;, Chinese speakers say respectively [ 个 ] { 人 }  (yí ge rén, one- [ CL ] person) or [ 个 ] { 人 }  (zhè ge rén, this- [ CL ] person). If a noun is preceded by both a demonstrative and a number, the demonstrative comes first. [ Hu 1993 13 ] (This is just as in English, e.g. &quot; these three cats &quot;.) If an adjective modifies the noun, it comes after the classifier and before the noun. The general structure of a classifier phrase is demonstrative  –   number  –   [ classifier red ]  –   adjective  –   noun The tables below give examples of common types of classifier phrases. { The examples are adapted from those given in } [ Hu 1993 13 ] {, } [ Erbaugh 1986 403–404 ] {, and } [ Li Thompson 1981 104–105 ] {. } While most English nouns do not need classifiers (special, rare phrases like &quot; five [ head of ] cattle &quot; do, but most ordinary phrases such as &quot; three cats &quot; do not), all Chinese nouns do; thus, in the first table, phrases that have no classifier in English have one in Chinese.

[ Zhang 2007 47 ] Furthermore, numbers and demonstratives are often not required in Chinese, so speakers may choose not to use one—and thus not to use a classifier. For example, to say &quot; Zhangsan turned into a tree &quot;, both [ 棵 ] { 树 }  (Zhāngsān biànchéng -le yì kē shù, Zhangsan become PAST one [ CL ] tree) and [ zh 张三变成了树 ]  (Zhāngsān biànchéng -le shù, Zhangsan become PAST tree) are acceptable. [ Li 2000 1119 ] [ Specialized uses ] alt=A traffic jam In addition to their uses with numbers and demonstratives, classifiers have some other functions. A classifier placed after a noun expresses a plural or indefinite quantity of it. For example, [ 本 ]  (shū-běn, book- [ CL ] ) means &quot; the books &quot; (e.g., on a shelf, or in a library), whereas the standard pre-nominal construction [ 本 ] { 书 }  (yì běn shū, one- [ CL ] book) means &quot; one book &quot;. [ Li Thompson 1981 82 ] Many classifiers may be reduplicated to mean &quot; every &quot;. For example, [ 个个 ] { 人 }  (gè-ge rén, [ CL ] - [ CL ] person) signifies &quot; every person &quot;. [ Li Thompson 1981 34–35 ] Finally, a classifier used along with 一 (yī, &quot; one &quot; ) and after a noun conveys a meaning close to &quot; all of &quot; or &quot; the entire &quot; or &quot; a ___ful of &quot;. [ Li Thompson 1981 111 ] The sentence [ 片 ] { 云 }  (tiānkōng yí piàn yún, sky one- [ CL ] cloud), meaning &quot; the sky was full of clouds &quot;, uses the classifier [ zh 片 ]  (piàn, slice), which refers to the sky, not the clouds. { See, for example, similar results in the Chinese corpus of the Center for Chinese Linguistics at } { Peking University : 天空一片, retrieved on 3 June 2009. } [ Types ] The vast majority of classifiers are those that count or classify nouns. [ Hu 1993 9 ] These are further subdivided into count-classifiers and mass-classifiers, described below. In everyday speech, people often use the term &quot; measure word &quot;, or its literal Chinese equivalent [ zh 量词 ]  liàngcí, to cover all Chinese classifiers and mass-classifiers, [ Li 2000 1116 ] {; } [ Hu 1993 7 ] {; } [ Wang 1994 22, 24–25 ] {; } [ He 2001 8 ] {. Also see the usage in } [ Fang Connelly 2008 ] { and most introductory Chinese textbooks. } but the types of words grouped under this term are not all the same. Specifically, the various types of classifiers exhibit numerous differences in meaning, in the kinds of words they attach to, and in syntactic behavior. Chinese has a large number of nominal classifiers; estimates of the number in Mandarin range from &quot; several dozen &quot; [ Li Thompson 1981 105 ] or &quot; about 50 &quot;, [ Chao 1968 section 7.9 ] to over 900. [ Zhang 2007 44 ] The range is so large because some of these estimates include all types of classifiers while others include only count-classifiers, { In addition to the count-mass distinction and nominal-verbal distinction described below, various linguists have proposed many additional divisions of classifiers by type. } [ He 2001 chapters 2 and 3 ] { contains a review of these. } and because the idea of what constitutes a &quot; classifier &quot; has changed over time. Today, regular dictionaries include 120 to 150 classifiers; [ Erbaugh 1986 403 ] {; } [ Fang Connelly 2008 ix ] the 8822-word Syllabus of Graded Words and Characters for Chinese Proficiency { The Syllabus of Graded Words and Characters for Chinese Proficiency is a standardized measure of vocabulary and character recognition, used in the } { People&apos;s Republic of China for testing middle school students, high school students, and foreign learners. The most recent edition was published in 2003 by the Testing Center of the National Chinese Proficiency Testing Committee. } ( [ 汉语水平词汇与汉字等级大纲 Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Cíhuì yú Hànzi Děngjí Dàgāng no ] ) lists 81; [ He 2001 234 ] and a 2009 list compiled by Gao Ming and Barbara Malt includes 126. [ Gao Malt 2009 1133 ] The number of classifiers that are in everyday, informal use, however, may be lower: linguist Mary Erbaugh has claimed that about two dozen &quot; core classifiers &quot; account for most classifier use. [ Erbaugh 1986 403 ] As a whole, though, the classifier system is so complex that specialized classifier dictionaries have been published. Including the following: [ Chen Baocun (陈保存) 1988 Chinese Classifier Dictionary (汉语量词词典) Fuzhou Fujian People&apos;s Publishing House (福建人民出版社) 978-7-211-00375-4 harv ] [ Fang Jiqing Connelly Michael 2008 Chinese Measure Word Dictionary Boston Cheng &amp; Tsui 0-88727-632-6 harv ] [ Jiao Fan (焦凡) 2001 A Chinese-English Dictionary of Measure Words (汉英量词词典) Beijing Sinolingua (华语敎学出版社) 978-7-80052-568-1 harv ] [ Liu Ziping (刘子平) 1996 Chinese Classifier Dictionary (汉语量词词典) Inner Mongolia Education Press (内蒙古教育出版社) 978-7-5311-2707-9 harv ] [ Count-classifiers and mass-classifiers ] [ A classifiercategorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual properties...which are permanently associated with entities named by the class of nouns; a measure worddoes not categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity named by a noun. right 25% #FFFFE0 right ] Within the set of nominal classifiers, linguists generally draw a distinction between &quot; count-classifiers &quot; and &quot; mass-classifiers &quot;. True count-classifiers { Count-classifiers have also been called &quot; individual classifiers &quot;, } [ Chao 1968 509 ] {, &quot; qualifying classifiers &quot; ( } [ Zhang 2007 45 ] {; } [ Hu 1993 10 ] { ), and just &quot; classifiers &quot; } [ Cheng Sybesma 1998 3 ] {. } are used for naming or counting a single count noun, and have no direct translation in English; for example, [ 本 ] { 书 }  (yì běn shū, one- [ CL ] book) can only be translated in English as &quot; one book &quot; or &quot; a book &quot;. [ Erbaugh 1986 404 ] Furthermore, count-classifiers cannot be used with mass noun s : just as an English speaker cannot ordinarily say * &quot; five muds &quot;, a Chinese speaker cannot say * [ 个 ] { 泥 }  (wǔ ge nì, five- [ CL ] mud). For such mass nouns, one must use mass-classifiers. { Mass-classifiers have also been called &quot; measure words &quot;, &quot; massifiers &quot; } [ Cheng Sybesma 1998 3 ] {, &quot; non-individual classifiers &quot; } [ Chao 1968 509 ] {, and &quot; quantifying classifiers &quot; ( } [ Zhang 2007 45 ] {; } [ Hu 1993 10 ] { ). The term &quot; mass-classifier &quot; is used in this article to avoid ambiguous usage of the term &quot; measure word &quot;, which is often used in everyday speech to refer to both count-classifiers and mass-classifiers, even though in technical usage it only means mass-classifiers } [ Li 2000 1116 ] {. } Mass-classifiers (true measure word s ) do not pick out inherent properties of an individual noun like count-classifiers do; rather, they lump nouns into countable units. Thus, mass-classifiers can generally be used with multiple types of nouns; for example, while the mass-classifier [ zh 盒 ]  (hé, box) can be used to count boxes of lightbulbs ( [ 盒 ] { 灯泡 }  yì hé dēngpào, &quot; one box of lightbulbs &quot; ) or of books ( [ 盒 ] { 教材 }  yì hé jiàocái, &quot; one box of textbooks &quot; ), each of these nouns must use a different count-classifier when being counted by itself ( [ 盏 ] { 灯泡 }  yì zhǎn dēngpào &quot; one lightbulb &quot;; vs. [ 本 ] { 教材 }  yì běn jiàocái &quot; one textbook &quot; ). While count-classifiers have no direct English translation, mass-classifiers often do: phrases with count-classifiers such as [ 个 ] { 人 }  (yí ge rén, one- [ CL ] person) can only be translated as &quot; one person &quot; or &quot; a person &quot;, whereas those with mass-classifiers such as [ 群 ] { 人 }  (yì qún rén, one-crowd-person) can be translated as &quot; a crowd of people &quot;. All languages, including English, have mass-classifiers, but count-classifiers are unique to certain &quot; classifier languages &quot;, and are not a part of English grammar apart from a few exceptional cases such as head of livestock. Within the range of mass-classifiers, authors have proposed subdivisions based on the manner in which a mass-classifier organizes the noun into countable units. One of these is measurement units (also called &quot; standard measures &quot; ), [ Ahrens 1994 239, note 3 ] which all languages must have in order to measure items; this category includes units such as kilometers, liters, or pounds. [ Li Thompson 1981 105 ] {; } [ Zhang 2007 44 ] {; } [ Erbaugh 1986 118, note 5 ] Like other classifiers, these can also stand without a noun; thus, for example, [ zh 磅 ]  (bàng, pound) may appear as both [ 磅 ] { 肉 }  (sān bàng ròu, &quot; three [ pounds ] of meat &quot; ) or just [ 磅 ]  (sān bàng, &quot; three [ pounds ] &quot;, never * [ 个磅 ]  sān ge bàng). [ Li Thompson 1981 105–107 ] Other proposed types of mass-classifiers include &quot; collective &quot; [ Erbaugh 1986 118, note 5 ] {; } [ Hu 1993 9 ] { Also called &quot; aggregate &quot; } [ Li Thompson 1981 107–109 ] { or &quot; group &quot; } [ Ahrens 1994 239, note 3 ] { measures. } mass-classifiers, such as [ 群 ] { 人 }  (yì qún rén, &quot; a [ crowd ] of people &quot; ), which group things less precisely; and &quot; container &quot; [ Erbaugh 1986 118, note 5 ] {; } [ Li Thompson 1981 107–109 ] mass-classifiers, which group things by containers they come in, as in [ 碗 ] { 粥 }  (yì wǎn zhōu, &quot; a [ bowl ] of porridge &quot; ) or [ 包 ] { 糖 }  (yì bāo táng, &quot; a [ bag ] of sugar &quot; ). While mass-classifiers are universal, count-classifiers only appear in certain languages. The difference between count-classifiers and mass-classifiers can be described as one of quantifying versus categorizing: in other words, mass-classifiers create a unit by which to measure something (i.e., boxes, groups, chunks, pieces, etc.), whereas count-classifiers simply name an existing item. [ Cheng Sybesma 1998 3 ] {; } [ Tai 1994 2 ] Most words can appear with both count-classifiers and mass-classifiers; for example, pizza can be described as both [ 张 ] { 比萨 } (yì zhāng bǐsà, &quot; one pizza &quot;, literally &quot; one [ pie ] of pizza &quot; ), using a count-classifier, and as [ 块 ] { 比萨 } (yí kuài bǐsà, &quot; one [ piece ] of pizza &quot; ), using a mass-classifier. In addition to these semantic differences, there are differences in the grammatical behaviors of count-classifiers and mass-classifiers; [ Wang 1994 27–36 ] {; } [ Cheng Sybesma 1998 ] for example, mass-classifiers may be modified by a small set of adjectives (as in [ 群 ] { 人 }  yí dà qún rén, &quot; a big [ crowd ] of people &quot; ), whereas count-classifiers usually may not (for example, * [ 个 ] { 人 }  yí dà ge rén is never said for &quot; a big person &quot;; instead the adjective must modify the noun: [ 个 ] { 大人 }  yí ge dà rén). [ Cheng Sybesma 1998 3–5 ] Another difference is that count-classifiers may often be replaced by a &quot; general &quot; classifier [ zh 个 ] ( [ zh 個 ] ), gè with no apparent change in meaning, whereas mass-classifiers may not. [ Wang 1994 29–30 ] Syntacticians Lisa Cheng and Rint Sybesma propose that count-classifiers and mass-classifiers have different underlying syntactic structures, with count-classifiers forming &quot; classifier phrases &quot;, { &quot; Classifier phrases &quot; are similar to } { noun phrase s, but with a classifier rather than a noun as the } { head } [ Cheng Sybesma 1998 16–17 ] {. } and mass-classifiers being a sort of relative clause that only looks like a classifier phrase. [ Cheng Sybesma 1998 ] The distinction between count-classifiers and mass-classifiers is often unclear, however, and other linguists have suggested that count-classifiers and mass-classifiers may not be fundamentally different. They posit that &quot; count-classifier &quot; and &quot; mass-classifier &quot; are the extremes of a continuum, with most classifiers falling somewhere in between. [ Ahrens 1994 239, note 5 ] {; } [ Wang 1994 26–27, 37–48 ] [ Verbal classifiers ] There is a set of &quot; verbal classifiers &quot; used for counting the number of times an action occurs, rather than counting a number of items; this set includes [ zh 次 ] cì, [ zh 遍 ] biàn, [ zh 回 ] huí, and [ zh 下 ] xià, which all roughly translate to &quot; times &quot;. [ He 2001 42, 44 ] For example, [ 次 ] { 北京 }  (wǒ qù-guo sān cì Běijīng, I go-PAST three- [ CL ] Beijing, &quot; I have been to Beijing three [ times ] &quot; ) uses a so-called &quot; verbal classifier &quot;. [ Zhang 2007 44 ] {; } [ Li Thompson 1981 110 ] {; } [ Fang Connelly 2008 x ] Beyond these verb-only classifiers, however, the division of classifiers into &quot; verbal &quot; and &quot; nominal &quot; is controversial. [ He 2001 30 ] Qian Hu defines &quot; verbal classifiers &quot; as classifiers that &quot; occur in a numerical noun phrase where the head noun is associated with an action &quot;, [ Hu 1993 7 ] and Charles Li and Sandra Thompson &apos;s Mandarin reference grammar lists them as essentially the same as nominal classifiers—in all their examples for [ zh 场 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 場 ] )  chǎng, a general verbal classifier that can be used for classifying any events (such as ballgames, fires, and movies), the verbal classifier is used in the same way as a nominal classifier would be. [ Li Thompson 1981 110 ] [ Relation to nouns ] [ zh 条 ] {  ( } [ zh-Hant-TW 條 ] { )  tiáo. } [ Tai 1994 8 ] { Rainbow_trout.png } { 91 } { A fish } [ zh 鱼 ] {, yú } { Denimjeans2.JPG } { 56 } { Pants } [ zh 裤子 ] {, kùzi } { Ulm2-midsize.jpg } { 114 } { A river } [ zh 河 ] {, hé } { Bench_in_Tehran.JPG } { 120 } { A bench } [ zh 凳子 ] {, dèngzi } { right } Different classifiers often correspond to different particular nouns. For example, books generally take the classifier [ zh 本 ]  běn, flat objects take [ zh 张 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 張 ] )  zhāng, animals take [ zh 只 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 隻 ] )  zhī, machines take [ zh 台 ]  tái, large buildings and mountains take [ zh 座 ]  zuò, etc. Within these categories are further subdivisions—while most animals take [ zh 只 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 隻 ] )  zhī, domestic animals take [ zh 头 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 頭 ] )  tóu, long and flexible animals take [ zh 条 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 條 ] )  tiáo, and horses take [ zh 匹 ]  pǐ. Likewise, while long things that are flexible (such as ropes) often take [ zh 条 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 條 ] )  tiáo, long things that are rigid (such as sticks) take [ zh 根 ]  gēn, unless they are also round (like pens or cigarettes), in which case in some dialects they take [ zh 枝 ]  zhī. [ Tai 1994 7–9 ] {; } [ Tai Wang 1990 ] Classifiers also vary in how specific they are; some (such as [ zh 朵 ]  duǒ for flowers) are generally only used with one item, whereas others (such as [ zh 条 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 條 ] )  tiáo for long and flexible things, one-dimensional things, or abstract items like news reports) { This may be because official documents during the } { Han Dynasty were written on long bamboo strips, making them &quot; strips of business &quot; } [ Ahrens 1994 206 ] {. } are much less restricted. [ Erbaugh 1986 111 ] Furthermore, there is not a one-to-one relationship between nouns and classifiers: the same noun may be paired with different classifiers in different situations. [ He 2001 239 ] The specific factors that govern which classifiers are paired with which nouns have been a subject of debate among linguists. [ Categories and prototypes ] While mass-classifiers do not necessarily bear any semantic relationship to the noun with which they are used (e.g., box and book are not related in meaning, but one can still say &quot; a box of books &quot; ), count-classifiers do. The precise nature of that relationship, however, is not certain, since there is so much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers. Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into categorical theories, which propose that count-classifiers are matched to objects solely on the basis of inherent features of those objects (such as length or size), and prototypical theories, which propose that people learn to match a count-classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype. [ Tai 1994 3–5 ] {; } [ Ahrens 1994 208–12 ] The categorical, &quot; classical &quot; [ Tai 1994 3 ] {; } [ Ahrens 1994 209–10 ] view of classifiers was that each classifier represents a category with a set of conditions; for example, the classifier [ zh 条 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 條 ] )  tiáo would represent a category defined as all objects that meet the conditions of being long, thin, and one-dimensional—and nouns using that classifier must fit all the conditions with which the category is associated. Some common semantic categories into which count-classifiers have been claimed to organize nouns include the categories of shape (long, flat, or round), size (large or small), consistency (soft or hard), animacy (human, animal, or object), [ Tai 1994 5 ] {; } [ Allan 1977 ] and function (tools, vehicles, machines, etc.). [ Hu 1993 1 ] [ zh 匹 ] {  pǐis sometimes used for } { mule s and } { camel s, but rarely for the less &quot; horse-like &quot; } { donkey s, suggesting that the choice of classifiers is influenced by prototypal closeness. } { Frecklesmule.jpg } { 143 } { A mule 骡子, luózi } { Donkey 1 arp 750px.jpg } { 150 } { A donkey 驴子, lǘzi } { left } On the other hand, proponents of prototype theory propose that count-classifiers may not have innate definitions, but are associated with a noun that is prototypical of that category, and nouns that have a &quot; family resemblance &quot; with the prototype noun will want to use the same classifier. { The theory described in } [ Ahrens 1994 ] { and } [ Wang 1994 ] { is also referred to within those works as a &quot; prototype &quot; theory, but differs somewhat from the version of prototype theory described here; rather than claiming that individual prototypes are the source for classifier meanings, these authors believe that classifiers still are based on categories with features, but that the categories have many features, and &quot; prototypes &quot; are words that have all the features of that category whereas other words in the category only have some features. In other words, &quot; there are core and marginal members of a category.... a member of a category does not necessarily possess all the properties of that category &quot; } [ Wang 1994 8 ] {. For instance, the classifier } [ zh 棵 ] {  kē is used for the category of trees, which may have features such as &quot; has a trunk &quot;, &quot; has leaves &quot;, and &quot; has branches &quot;, &quot; is deciduous &quot;; maple trees would be prototypes of the category, since they have all these features, whereas palm trees only have a trunk and leaves and thus are not prototypical } [ Ahrens 1994 211–12 ] {. } For example, horse in Chinese uses the classifier [ zh 匹 ]  pǐ, as in [ 匹 ] { 马 }  (sān pǐ mǎ, &quot; three horses &quot; )—in modern Chinese the word [ zh 匹 ] has no meaning. Nevertheless, nouns denoting animals that look like horses will often also use this same classifier, and native speakers have been found to be more likely to use the classifier [ zh 匹 ] the closer an animal looks to a horse. [ Tai 1994 12 ] Furthermore, words that do not meet the &quot; criteria &quot; of a semantic category may still use that category because of their association with a prototype. For example, the classifier [ zh 颗 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 顆 ] )  kē is used for small round items, as in [ 颗 ] { 子弹 }  (yì kē zǐdàn, &quot; one bullet &quot; ); when words like [ zh 原子弹 ]  (yuánzǐdàn, &quot; atomic bomb &quot; ) were later introduced into the language they also used this classifier, even though they are not small and round—therefore, their classifier must have been assigned because of the words&apos; association with the word for bullet, which acted as a &quot; prototype &quot;. [ Zhang 2007 46–47 ] This is an example of &quot; generalization &quot; from prototypes: Erbaugh has proposed that when children learn count-classifiers, they go through stages, first learning a classifier-noun pair only (such as [ 条 ] { 鱼 }  tiáo yú, [ CL ] -fish), then using that classifier with multiple nouns that are similar to the prototype (such as other types of fish), then finally using that set of nouns to generalize a semantic feature associated with the classifier (such as length and flexibility) so that the classifier can then be used with new words that the person encounters. [ Erbaugh 1986 415 ] Some classifier-noun pairings are arbitrary, or at least appear to modern speakers to have no semantic motivation. [ Hu 1993 1 ] {; } [ Tai 1994 13 ] {; } [ Zhang 2007 55–56 ] For instance, the classifier [ zh 部 ]  bù may be used for movies and novels, but also for cars [ Zhang 2007 55–56 ] and telephones. [ Gao Malt 2009 1134 ] Some of this arbitrariness may be due to what linguist James Tai refers to as &quot; fossilization &quot;, whereby a count-classifier loses its meaning through historical changes but remains paired with some nouns. For example, the classifier [ zh 匹 ]  pǐ used for horses is meaningless today, but in Classical Chinese may have referred to a &quot; team of two horses &quot;, [ Morev 2000 79 ] a pair of horse skeletons, [ Wang 1994 172–73 ] or the pairing between man and horse. [ Tai 1994 15, note 7 ] { The apparent disagreement between the definitions provided by different authors may reflect different uses of these words in different time periods. It is well-attested that many classifiers underwent frequent changes of meaning throughout history ( } [ Wang 1994 ] {; } [ Erbaugh 1986 426–31 ] {; } [ Ahrens 1994 205–206 ] { ), so } [ zh 匹 ] {  pǐ may have had all these meanings at different points in history. } Arbitrariness may also arise when a classifier is borrowed, along with its noun, from a dialect in which it has a clear meaning to one in which it does not. [ Tai 1994 13 ] In both these cases, the use of the classifier is remembered more by association with certain &quot; prototypical &quot; nouns (such as horse) rather than by understanding of semantic categories, and thus arbitrariness has been used as an argument in favor of the prototype theory of classifiers. Gao and Malt propose that both the category and prototype theories are correct: in their conception, some classifiers constitute &quot; well-defined categories &quot;, others make &quot; prototype categories &quot;, and still others are relatively arbitrary. [ Gao Malt 2009 1133 –4 ] [ Neutralization ] In addition to the numerous &quot; specific &quot; count-classifiers described above, { Also called &quot; sortal classifiers &quot; ( } [ Erbaugh 2000 33 ] {; } [ Biq 2002 531 ] { ). } Chinese has a &quot; general &quot; classifier [ zh 个 ] ( [ zh 個 ] ), pronounced gè in Mandarin. { Kathleen Ahrens claimed in 1994 that the classifier for animals— } [ zh 隻 ] {, pronounced zhī in Mandarin and jia in } { Taiwanese —is in the process of becoming a second general classifier in the Mandarin spoken in } { Taiwan, and already is used as the general classifier in Taiwanese itself } [ Ahrens 1994 206 ] {. } This classifier is used for people, some abstract concepts, and other words that do not have special classifiers (such as 汉堡包 hànbǎobāo &quot; hamburger &quot; ), [ Hu 1993 12 ] and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as [ zh 张 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 張 ] )  zhāng or [ zh 条 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 條 ] )  tiáo, especially in informal speech. It has been noted as early as the 1940s that the use of [ zh 个 ] is increasing and that there is a general tendency towards replacing specific classifiers with it. [ Tzeng Chen Hung 1991 193 ] Numerous studies have reported that both adults and children tend to use [ zh 个 ] when they do not know the appropriate count-classifier, and even when they do but are speaking quickly or informally. [ Zhang 2007 57 ] The replacement of a specific classifier with the general [ zh 个 ] is known as classifier neutralization [ Ahrens 1994 212 ] ( &quot; [ zh 量词个化 ] &quot; in Chinese, literally &quot; classifier 个-ization &quot; [ He 2001 165 ] ). This occurs especially often among children [ Erbaugh 1986 ] {; } [ Hu 1993 ] and aphasics (individuals with damage to language-relevant areas of the brain), [ Ahrens 1994 227–32 ] [ Tzeng Chen Hung 1991 ] although normal speakers also neutralize frequently. It has been reported that most speakers know the appropriate classifiers for the words they are using and believe, when asked, that those classifiers are obligatory, but nevertheless use [ zh 个 ] without even realizing it in actual speech. [ Erbaugh 1986 404–406 ] {; } [ Ahrens 1994 202–203 ] As a result, in everyday use the general classifier is &quot; hundreds of times more frequent &quot; [ Erbaugh 1986 404–406 ] than the specialized ones. Nevertheless, [ zh 个 ] has not completely replaced other count-classifiers, and there are still many situations in which it would be inappropriate to substitute it for the required specific classifier. There may be specific patterns behind which classifier-noun pairs may be &quot; neutralized &quot; to use the general classifier, and which may not. Specifically, words that are most prototypical for their categories, such as paper for the category of nouns taking the &quot; flat/square &quot; classifier [ zh 张 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 張 ] )  zhāng, may be less likely to be said with a general classifier. [ Ahrens 1994 ] [ Variation in usage ] [ zh 张 ] {  ( } [ zh-Hant-TW 張 ] { )  zhāngand } [ zh 幅 ] {  fú; both phrases have the same meaning, but convey different stylistic effects. } [ Zhang 2007 53 ] { Depending on the classifier used, the noun } [ zh 楼 ] {  lóucould describe either this building, as in } [ 座 ] { 楼 } {  (yí zuò lóu &quot; one building &quot; ), or the floors of the building, as in } [ 层 ] { 楼 } {  (èrshí céng lóu, &quot; twenty floors &quot; ). } [ Zhang 2007 52 ] { Chinese ink painting depicting a man sitting under a tree } { Photo of a tower with over 20 stories. } It is not the case that every noun is only associated with one classifier. Across dialects and speakers there is great variability in the way classifiers are used for the same words, and speakers often do not agree which classifier is best. [ Tai 1994 ] {; } [ Erbaugh 2000 34–35 ] For example, for cars some people use [ zh 部 ]  bù, others use [ zh 台 ]  tái, and still others use [ zh 辆 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 輛 ] )  liàng; Cantonese uses [ zh 架 ]  gaa3. Even within a single dialect or a single speaker, the same noun may take different measure words depending on the style in which the person is speaking, or on different nuances the person wants to convey (for instance, measure words can reflect the speaker&apos;s judgment of or opinion about the object [ He 2001 237 ] ). An example of this is the word for person, [ zh 人 ]  rén, which uses the measure word [ zh 个 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 個 ] )  gè normally, but uses the measure [ zh 口 ]  kǒu when counting number of people in a household, and [ zh 位 ]  wèi when being particularly polite or honorific, and [ zh 名 ]  míng in formal, written contexts; [ Fang Connelly 2008 ix ] {; } [ Zhang 2007 53–54 ] likewise, a group of people may be referred to by massifiers as [ 群 ] { 人 } (yì qún rén, &quot; a group of people &quot; ) or [ 帮 ] { 人 } (yì bāng rén, &quot; a gang/crowd of people &quot; ): the first is neutral, whereas the second implies that the people are unruly or otherwise being judged poorly. [ He 2001 242 ] Some count-classifiers may also be used with nouns that they are not normally related to, for metaphorical effect, as in [ 堆 ] { 烦恼 }  (yí duì fánnǎo, &quot; a [ pile ] of worries/troubles &quot; ). [ Shie 2003 76 ] Finally, a single word may have multiple count-classifiers that convey different meanings altogether—in fact, the choice of a classifier can even influence the meaning of a noun. By way of illustration, [ 节 ] { 课 }  sān jié kè means &quot; three class periods &quot; (as in &quot; I have three classes today &quot; ), whereas [ 门 ] { 课 }  sān mén kè means &quot; three courses &quot; (as in &quot; I signed up for three courses this semester &quot; ), even though the noun in each sentence is the same. [ Purpose ] In research on classifier systems, and Chinese classifiers in particular, linguists have asked why count-classifiers (as opposed to mass-classifiers) exist at all. Mass-classifiers are present in all languages since they are the only way to &quot; count &quot; mass nouns that are not naturally divided into units (as, for example, &quot; three [ splotches ] of mud &quot; in English; * &quot; three muds &quot; is ungrammatical). On the other hand, count-classifiers are not inherently mandatory, and are absent from most languages. [ Tai 1994 3 ] {; } [ Allan 1997 285–86 ] {; } [ Wang 1994 1 ] { Although English does not have a productive system of count-classifiers and is not considered a &quot; classifier language &quot;, it does have a few constructions—mostly archaic or specialized—that resemble count-classifiers, such as &quot; X head of cattle &quot; } [ T&apos;sou 1976 1221 ] {. } Furthermore, count-classifiers are used with an &quot; unexpectedly low frequency &quot;; [ Erbaugh 2000 34 ] in many settings, speakers avoid specific classifiers by just using a bare noun (without a number or demonstrative) or using the general classifier [ zh 个 ]  gè. [ Erbaugh 2000 425–26 ] {; } [ Li 2000 ] Linguists and typologists such as Joseph Greenberg have suggested that specific count-classifiers are semantically &quot; redundant &quot;, repeating information present within the noun. [ Zhang 2007 51 ] Count-classifiers can be used stylistically, though, and can also be used to clarify or limit a speaker&apos;s intended meaning when using a vague or ambiguous noun; for example, the noun [ zh 课 ]  kè &quot; class &quot; can refer to courses in a semester or specific class periods during a day, depending on whether the classifier [ zh 门 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 門 ] )  mén or [ zh 节 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 節 ] )  jié is used. [ Zhang 2007 51–52 ] One proposed explanation for the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. [ Erbaugh 1986 425–6 ] An alternate account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, [ Sun 1988 298 ] or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. [ Li 2000 ] In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it. [ History ] [ Classifier phrases ] { oracle bone inscription from the } { Shāng Dynasty. Such inscriptions provide some of the earliest examples of the number phrases that may have eventually spawned Chinese classifiers. } { alt=An off-white, ovular turtle shell with an inscription in ancient Chinese } Historical linguists have found that phrases consisting of nouns and numbers went through several structural changes in Old Chinese and Middle Chinese before classifiers appeared in them. The earliest forms may have been Number  –  Noun, like English (i.e., &quot; five horses &quot; ), and the less common Noun  –  Number ( &quot; horses five &quot; ), both of which are attested in the oracle bone script s of Pre-Archaic Chinese (circa 1400  BCE to 1000  BCE). [ Peyraube 1991 107 ] {; } [ Morev 2000 78–79 ] The first constructions resembling classifier constructions were Noun  –  Number  –  Noun constructions, which were also extant in Pre-Archaic Chinese but less common than Number  –  Noun. In these constructions, sometimes the first and second nouns were identical (N1  –  Number  –  N1, as in &quot; horses five horses &quot; ) and other times the second noun was different, but semantically related (N1  –  Number  –  N2). According to some historical linguists, the N2 in these constructions can be considered an early form of count-classifier and has even been called an &quot; echo classifier &quot;; this speculation is not universally agreed on, though. [ Peyraube 1991 108 ] Although true count-classifiers had not appeared yet, mass-classifiers were common in this time, with constructions such as &quot; wine  –  six  –   [ yǒu ] &quot; (the word [ zh 酉 ]  yǒu represented a wine container) meaning &quot; six yǒu of wine &quot;. Examples such as this suggest that mass-classifiers predate count-classifiers by several centuries, although they did not appear in the same word order as they do today. [ Peyraube 1991 110 ] {; } [ Wang 1994 171–72 ] It is from this type of structure that count-classifiers may have arisen, originally replacing the second noun (in structures where there was a noun rather than a mass-classifier) to yield Noun  –  Number  –  Classifier. That is to say, constructions like &quot; horses five horses &quot; may have been replaced by ones like &quot; horses five [ CL ] &quot;, possibly for stylistic reasons such as avoiding repetition. [ Morev 2000 78–79 ] Another reason for the appearance of count-classifiers may have been to avoid confusion or ambiguity that could have arisen from counting items using only mass-classifiers—i.e., to clarify when one is referring to a single item and when one is referring to a measure of items. [ Wang 1994 172 ] Historians agree that at some point in history the order of words in this construction shifted, putting the noun at the end rather than beginning, like in the present-day construction Number  –  Classifier  –  Noun. [ Peyraube 1991 106 ] {; } [ Morev 2000 78–79 ] According to historical linguist Alain Peyraube, the earliest occurrences of this construction (albeit with mass-classifiers, rather than count-classifiers) appear in the late portion of Old Chinese (500  BCE to 200  BCE). At this time, the Number  –  Mass-classifier portion of the Noun  –  Number  –  Mass-classifier construction is was sometimes shifted in front of the noun. Peyraube speculates that this may have occurred because it was gradually reanalyzed as a modifier (like an adjective) for the head noun, as opposed to a simple repetition as it originally was. Since Chinese generally places modifiers before modified, as does English, the shift may have been prompted by this reanalysis. By the early part of the Common Era, the nouns appearing in &quot; classifier position &quot; were beginning to lose their meaning and become true classifiers. Estimates of when classifiers underwent the most development vary: Wang Li claims their period of major development was during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), [ He 2001 3 ] whereas Liu Shiru estimates that it was the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420 – 589 CE), [ Wang 1994 2, 17 ] and Peyraube chooses the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 CE). [ Peyraube 1991 111–17 ] Regardless of when they developed, Wang Lianqing claims that they did not become grammatically mandatory until sometime around the 11th century. [ Wang 1994 3 ] Classifier systems in many nearby languages and language groups (such as Vietnamese and the Tai languages ) are very similar to the Chinese classifier system in both grammatical structure and the parameters along which some objects are grouped together. Thus, there has been some debate over which language family first developed classifiers and which ones then borrowed them—or whether classifier systems were native to all these languages and developed more through repeated language contact throughout history. [ Erbaugh 1986 401 ] {; } [ Wang 1994 2 ] [ Classifier words ] Most modern count-classifiers are derived from words that originally were free-standing nouns in older varieties of Chinese, and have since been grammaticalized to become bound morphemes. [ Shie 2003 76 ] {; } [ Wang 1994 113–14; 172–73 ] In other words, count-classifiers tend to come from words that once had specific meaning but lost it (a process known as semantic bleaching ). [ Peyraube 1991 116 ] Many, however, still have related forms that work as nouns all by themselves, such as the classifier [ zh 带 ]  ( [ zh-Hant-TW 帶 ] )  dài for long, ribbon-like objects: the modern word [ zh 带子 ]  dàizi means &quot; ribbon &quot;. In fact, the majority of classifiers can also be used as other parts of speech, such as nouns. [ Gao Malt 2009 1130 ] Mass-classifiers, on the other hand, are more transparent in meaning than count-classifiers; while the latter have some historical meaning, the former are still full-fledged nouns. For example, [ zh 杯 ]  (bēi, cup), is both a classifier as in [ 杯 ] { 茶 }  (yì bēi chá, &quot; a [ cup ] of tea &quot; ) and the word for a cup as in [ zh 酒杯 ]  (jiǔbēi, &quot; wine glass &quot; ). [ Chien Lust Chiang 2003 92 ] [ Where do these classifiers come from? Each classifier has its own history. right 20% #FFFFE0 right ] It may not have always been the case that every noun required a count-classifier. In many historical varieties of Chinese, use of classifiers was not mandatory, and classifiers are rare in writings that have survived. [ Peyraube 1991 ] {; } [ Erbaugh 1986 401 ] Some nouns acquired classifiers earlier than others; some of the first documented uses of classifiers were for inventorying items, both in mercantile business and in storytelling. [ Erbaugh 1986 401 ] Thus, the first nouns to have count-classifiers paired with them may have been nouns that represent &quot; culturally valued &quot; items such as horses, scrolls, and intellectuals. [ Erbaugh 1986 401, 403, 428 ] The special status of such items is still apparent today: many of the classifiers that can only be paired with one or two nouns, such as [ zh 匹 ]  pǐ for horses { Today, } [ zh 匹 ] { may also be used for } { bolts of cloth. See &quot; List of Common Nominal Measure Words &quot; on ChineseNotes.com (last modified 11 January 2009; retrieved on 3 September 2009). } and [ zh 首 ]  shǒu for songs or poems, are the classifiers for these same &quot; valued &quot; items. Such classifiers make up as much as one-third of the commonly used classifiers today. [ other names ] Classifiers did not gain official recognition as a lexical category (part of speech) until the 20th century. The earliest modern text to discuss classifiers and their use was Ma Jianzhong &apos;s 1898 Ma&apos;s Basic Principles for Writing Clearly ( [ zh 马氏文通 ] ). [ He 2001 2 ] From then until the 1940s, linguists such as Ma, Wang Li, and Li Jinxi treated classifiers as just a type of noun that &quot; expresses a quantity &quot;. Lü Shuxiang was the first to treat them as a separate category, calling them &quot; unit words &quot; ( [ zh 单位词 ]  dānwèicí) in his 1940s Outline of Chinese Grammar ( [ zh 中国文法要略 ] ) and finally &quot; measure words &quot; ( [ zh 量词 ]  liàngcí) in Grammar Studies ( [ zh 语法学习 ] ). He made this separation based on the fact that classifiers were semantically bleached, and that they can be used directly with a number, whereas true nouns need to have a measure word added before they can be used with a number. [ He 2001 4 ] After this time, other names were also proposed for classifiers: Gao Mingkai called them &quot; noun helper words &quot; ( [ zh 助名词 ]  zhùmíngcí), Lu Wangdao &quot; counting markers &quot; ( [ zh 计标 ]  jìbiāo), and Japanese linguist Miyawaki Kennosuke called them &quot; accompanying words &quot; ( [ zh 陪伴词 ]  péibàncí). [ He 2001 5–6 ] In the Draft Plan for a System of Teaching Chinese Grammar ( [ zh 暂拟汉语教学语法系统 ] ) adopted by the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1954, Lü&apos;s &quot; measure words &quot; ( [ zh 量词 ]  liàngcí) was adopted as the official name for classifiers in China. [ He 2001 7 ] This remains the most common term in use today. [ General classifiers ] Historically, [ zh 个 ] gè was not always the general classifier. Some believe it was originally a noun referring to bamboo stalks, and gradually expanded in use to become a classifier for many things with &quot; vertical, individual, [or] upright qualit[ies] &quot;, [ Erbaugh 1986 430 ] eventually becoming a general classifier because it was used so frequently with common nouns. [ Erbaugh 1986 428–30 ] {; } [ Ahrens 1994 205 ] The classifier gè is actually associated with three different homophonous characters: [ zh 个 ], [ zh 個 ] (used today as the traditional-character equivalent of [ zh 个 ] ), and [ zh 箇 ]. Historical linguist Lianqing Wang has argued that these characters actually originated from different words, and that only [ zh 箇 ] had the original meaning of &quot; bamboo stalk &quot;. [ Wang 1994 114–15 ] [ zh 个 ], she claims, was used as a general classifier early on, and may have been derived from the orthographically similar [ zh 介 ] jiè, one of the earliest general classifiers. [ Wang 1994 95 ] [ zh 箇 ] later merged with [ zh 介 ] because they were similar in pronunciation and meaning (both used as general classifiers). Likewise, she claims that [ zh 個 ] was also a separate word (with a meaning having to do with &quot; partiality &quot; or &quot; being a single part &quot; ), and merged with [ zh 个 ] for the same reasons as [ zh 箇 ] did; she also argues that [ zh 個 ] was &quot; created &quot;, as early as the Han Dynasty, to supersede [ zh 个 ]. [ Wang 1994 115–16; 158 ] Nor was [ zh 个 ] the only general classifier in the history of Chinese. The aforementioned [ zh 介 ] jiè was being used as a general classifier before the Qin Dynasty (221 BCE); it was originally a noun referring to individual items out of a string of connected shells or clothes, and eventually came to be used as a classifier for &quot; individual &quot; objects (as opposed to pairs or groups of objects) before becoming a general classifier. [ Wang 1994 93–95 ] Another general classifier was [ zh 枚 ] méi, which originally referred to small twigs. Since twigs were used for counting items, [ zh 枚 ] became a counter word: any items, including people, could be counted as &quot; one [ zh 枚 ], two [ zh 枚 ] &quot;, etc. [ zh 枚 ] was the most common classifier in use during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420–589 CE), [ Wang 1994 155–7 ] but today is no longer a general classifier, and is only used rarely, as a specialized classifier for pins and badges. [ Erbaugh 1986 428 ] Kathleen Ahrens has claimed that [ zh 隻 ] (zhī in Mandarin and jia in Taiwanese ), the classifier for animals in Mandarin, is another general classifier in Taiwanese and may be becoming one in the Mandarin spoken in Taiwan. [ Ahrens 1994 206 ] [ Variety ] Northern dialects tend to have fewer classifiers than southern ones. 個 (ge) is the only classifier found in the Dungan language. All nouns could have just one classifier in some dialects, such as Shanghainese, Standard Mandarin Shanxi dialect, Shandong dialects. Some dialects such as Northern Min, certain Xiang dialects, Hakka Chinese, and Yue Chinese use 雙 for the noun referring to people, rather than 個 (ge). [ Graham Thurgood, Randy J. LaPolla Graham Thurgood, Randy J. LaPolla illustrated Psychology Press 2003 85 0-7007-1129-5 In general, the Southern dialects have a greater number of classifiers than the Northern. The farther north one travels, the smaller the variety of classifiers found. In Dunganese, a Gansu dialect of Northern Chinese spoken in Central Asia, only one classifier, 個 [kə], is used; and this same classifier has almost become the cover classifier for all nouns in Lánzhou of Gansu too. The tendency to use one general classifier for all nouns is also found to a greater or lesser extent in many Shanxi dialects, some Shandong dialects, and even the Shanghai dialect of Wu and Standard Mandarin (SM). The choice of classifiers for individual nouns is particular to each dialects. For example, altohugh the preferred classifier across dialects for &apos;human being&apos; is 個 and its cognates, 雙 in its dialect forms is widely used in the Hakka and Yue dialects of Guangxi and western Guangdong provinces as well as in the Northern Min dialects and some Xiang dialects in Hunan.
