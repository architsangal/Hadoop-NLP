Besides the Quran, Muhammad’s life ( sira ) and traditions ( sunnah ) are also upheld by Muslims. They discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence, adding the phrase peace be upon him whenever their names are mentioned. { Ann Goldman, Richard Hain, Stephen Liben (2006), p. 212 } While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and premodern times were largely negative, appraisals in modern history have been far less so. { Watt (1974) p. 231 } [ Names and appellations in the Quran ] { Thuluth, a script variety of } { Islamic calligraphy. } The name &apos;&apos;Muhammad&apos;&apos; means &quot; Praiseworthy &quot; and occurs four times in the Quran. { Jean-Louis Déclais, Names of the Prophet, } { Encyclopedia of the Quran } The Quran addresses Muhammad in the second person not by his name but by the appellations prophet, messenger, servant of God ( &apos;abd ), announcer (bashir) [ 2 119 ], witness ( shahid ), [ 33 45 ] bearer of good tidings (mubashshir), warner (nathir), [ 11 2 ] reminder (mudhakkir), [ 88 21 ] one who calls [unto God] ( dā‘ī ), [ 12 108 ] light personified (noor) [ 05 15 ], and the light-giving lamp (siraj munir) [ 73 1 ].

The work is lost, but was used verbatim at great length by Ibn Hisham and Al-Tabari. { S. A.

Many scholars accept the accuracy of the earliest biographies, though their accuracy is unascertainable. Recent studies have led scholars to distinguish between the traditions touching legal matters and the purely historical ones. In the former sphere, traditions could have been subject to invention while in the latter sphere, aside from exceptional cases, the material may have been only subject to &quot; tendential shaping &quot;. { Watt (1953), p.xv } [ Hadith ] [ Hadith ] In addition, the hadith collection s are accounts of the verbal and physical traditions of Muhammad that date from several generations after his death. { Lewis (1993), pp. 33–34 } Western academics view the hadith collections with caution as accurate historical sources. Scholars such as Madelung do not reject the narrations which have been compiled in later periods, but judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures. { Madelung (1997), pp.xi, 19 and 20 } [ Non-Arabic sources ] The earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from Byzantine sources. They indicate that both Jews and Christians saw Muhammad as a &quot; false prophet &quot;. In the Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati of 634, Muhammad is portrayed as being &quot; deceiving[,] for do prophets come with sword and chariot ?, [...] you will discover nothing true from the said prophet except human bloodshed. &quot; { Walter Emil Kaegi, Jr., &quot; Initial Byzantine Reactions to the Arab Conquest &quot;, Church History, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), p. 139-149, p. 139-142, quoting from Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati 86-87 } Another Greek source for Muhammad is the 9th-century writer Theophanes. The earliest Syriac source is the 7th-century writer John bar Penkaye. { Philip K. Hitti, History of the Arabs, 10th edition (1970), p.112. } [ Pre-Islamic Arabia ] Main tribes and settlements of Arabia in Muhammad&apos;s lifetime [ Pre-Islamic Arabia Jahiliyyah Arabian mythology ] The Arabian Peninsula was largely arid and volcanic, making agriculture difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was thus dotted with towns and cities, two prominent ones being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes. { Watt (1953), pp.1–2 } Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, as people needed support against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal grouping was encouraged by the need to act as a unit, this unity being based on the bond of kinship by blood. { Watt (1953), pp. 16–18 } Indigenous Arabs were either nomad ic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling from one place to another seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival was also dependent on raiding caravans or oases, the nomads not viewing this as a crime. { Loyal Rue, Religion Is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological,2005, p.224 } { John Esposito, Islam, Expanded edition, Oxford University Press, p.4–5 } In pre-Islamic Arabia, gods or goddesses were viewed as protectors of individual tribes, their spirits being associated with sacred trees, stones, springs and wells. As well as being the site of an annual pilgrimage, the Kaaba shrine in Mecca housed 360 idol statues of tribal patron deities. Aside from these gods, the Arabs shared a common belief in a supreme deity called Allah [ December 2011 ] (literally &quot; the god &quot; ), who was remote from their everyday concerns and thus not the object of cult or ritual. [ December 2011 ] Three goddesses were associated with Allah as his daughters: Allāt, Manāt and al-‘Uzzá. Monotheistic communities existed in Arabia, including Christian s and Jews. See: Esposito, Islam, Extended Edition, Oxford University Press, pp.5–7 Quran 3:95 Hanif s – native pre-Islamic Arab monotheists – are also sometimes listed alongside Jews and Christians in pre-Islamic Arabia, although their historicity is disputed amongst scholars. { Kochler (1982), p.29 } { cf. Uri Rubin, Hanif, Encyclopedia of the Qur&apos;an } According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad himself was a Hanif and one of the descendants of Ishmael, son of Abraham. See: Louis Jacobs(1995), p.272 Turner (2005), p.16 [ Life ] [ Life in Mecca ] [ Muhammad in Mecca ] Muhammad was born and lived in Mecca for the first 52 years of his life (570–622). This period is generally divided into two phases, before and after declaring the prophecy. [ Childhood and early life ] [ Mawlid Family tree of Muhammad ] Muhammad was born in the month of Rabi&apos; al-awwal in 570. He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan, one of the prominent families of Mecca, although it seems not to have been prosperous during Muhammad&apos;s early lifetime. { See also } [ 43 31 ns ] { cited in EoI; Muhammad } The Banu Hashim clan was part of the Quraysh tribe. Tradition places the year of Muhammad&apos;s birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant, which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca that year by the Aksumite king Abraha who had in his army a number of elephants. 20th-century scholarship has suggested alternative dates for this event, such as 568 or 569. { Watt (1974), p. 7. } { Rashid-al-Din Hamadani &apos;s &apos;&apos; } { Jami al-Tawarikh &apos;&apos;, } [ 1315 ] {, illustrating the story of Muhammad&apos;s role in re-setting the } { Black Stone in 605. Ali, Wijdan (1999), p. 3 } His father, Abdullah, died almost six months before Muhammad was born. { Josef W. Meri (2005), p. 525 } According to Islamic tradition, soon after Muhammad&apos;s birth he was sent to live with a Bedouin family in the desert, as the desert life was considered healthier for infants. Muhammad stayed with his foster-mother, Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb, and her husband until he was two years old. Some western scholars of Islam have rejected the historicity of this tradition. { Watt, Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb, } { Encyclopaedia of Islam } [ February 2012 ] At the age of six, Muhammad lost his biological mother Amina to illness and he became fully orphaned. { Watt, Amina, } { Encyclopaedia of Islam } For the next two years, he was under the guardianship of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, of the Banu Hashim clan, but when Muhammad was eight, his grandfather also died. He then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of Banu Hashim. According to William Montgomery Watt, because of the general disregard of the guardians in taking care of weak members of the tribes in Mecca in the 6th century, &quot; Muhammad&apos;s guardians saw that he did not starve to death, but it was hard for them to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time. &quot; { Watt (1974), p. 8. } While still in his teens, Muhammad accompanied his uncle on trading journeys to Syria gaining experience in commercial trade, the only career open to Muhammad as an orphan. Islamic tradition states that when Muhammad was either nine or twelve while accompanying the Meccans&apos; caravan to Syria, he met a Christian monk or hermit named Bahira who is said to have foreseen Muhammed&apos;s career as a prophet of God. { Armand Abel, Bahira, } { Encyclopaedia of Islam } Little is known of Muhammad during his later youth, and from the fragmentary information that is available, it is difficult to separate history from legend. It is known that he became a merchant and &quot; was involved in trade between the Indian ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. &quot; { Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History (2005), v.3, p. 1025 } Due to his upright character he acquired the nickname &quot; al-Amin &quot; (Arabic: الامين), meaning &quot; faithful, trustworthy &quot; and &quot; al-Sadiq &quot; meaning &quot; truthful &quot; [ Khan Majid Ali Muhammad the final messenger 1998 332 1998 Islamic Book Service India 81-85738-25-4 ] and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator. { Esposito (1998), p. 6 } His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadijah, a 40-year-old widow who was 15 years older than he. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. Several years later, according to a narration collected by Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone in place in the wall of the Kaaba in 605 C.E. The Black Stone, a sacred object, had been removed to facilitate renovations to the Kaaba. The leaders of Mecca could not agree on which clan should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place. They agreed to wait for the next man to come through the gate and ask him to choose. That man was the 35-year-old Muhammad, five years before his first revelation. He asked for a cloth and put the Black Stone in its centre. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad set the stone in place, satisfying the honour of all.

Bogle (1998), p.6 } { John Henry Haaren, Addison B. Poland (1904), p.83 } Islamic tradition holds that during one of his visits to Mount Hira, the angel Gabriel appeared to him in the year 610 and commanded Muhammad to recite the following verses: { Brown (2003), pp. 72–73 } [ 96 1 5 ns ] After returning home, Muhammad was consoled and reassured by Khadijah and her Christian cousin, Waraqah ibn Nawfal. Upon receiving his first revelations, he was deeply distressed and resolved to commit suicide. { Esposito (2010), p.8 } He also feared that others would dismiss his claims as being possessed. Shi&apos;a tradition maintains that Muhammad was neither surprised nor frightened at the appearance of Gabriel but rather welcomed him as if he had been expecting him. See: Emory C. Bogle (1998), p.7 Razwy (1996), ch. 9 Rodinson (2002), p. 71. The initial revelation was followed by a pause of three years during which Muhammad further gave himself to prayers and spiritual practice s. When the revelations resumed he was reassured and commanded to begin preaching: &quot; Thy Guardian-Lord hath not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased. &quot; [ 93 3 ns ] { Brown (2003), pp. 73–74 } { Uri Rubin, Muhammad, } { Encyclopedia of the Quran } { depiction of Muhammad receiving his first revelation from the angel Gabriel. From the manuscript &apos;&apos; } { Jami&apos; al-tawarikh &apos;&apos; by } { Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, 1307, } { Ilkhanate period. } Sahih Bukhari narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as, &quot; Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell &quot; and Aisha reported, &quot; I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over) &quot;. [ http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/001-sbt.php Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement Cmje.org 2012-01-26 ] According to Welch these revelations were accompanied by mysterious seizures, and the reports are unlikely to have been forged by later Muslims. Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his own thoughts from these messages. { Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam (1977), p. 31. } According to the Quran, one of the main roles of Muhammad is to warn the unbelievers of their eschatological punishment (Quran [ 38 70 ns n ], Quran [ 6 19 ns n ] ). Sometimes the Quran does not explicitly refer to the Judgment day but provides examples from the history of some extinct communities and warns Muhammad&apos;s contemporaries of similar calamities (Quran [ 41 13 16 ns n ] ). Muhammad is not only a warner to those who reject God&apos;s revelation, but also a bearer of good news for those who abandon evil, listen to the divine word and serve God. { Daniel C. Peterson, Good News, } { Encyclopedia of the Quran } Muhammad&apos;s mission also involves preaching monotheism: The Quran commands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of his Lord and instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God. The key themes of the early Quranic verses included the responsibility of man towards his creator; the resurrection of dead, God&apos;s final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in hell and pleasures in Paradise; and the signs of God in all aspects of life. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not to kill newborn girls. [ Opposition ] [ Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans Migration to Abyssinia ] According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad&apos;s wife Khadija was the first to believe he was a prophet. { Watt (1953), p. 86 } She was soon followed by Muhammad&apos;s ten-year-old cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib, close friend Abu Bakr, and adopted son Zaid. Around 613, Muhammad began his public preaching (Quran [ 26 214 ns n ] ). { Ramadan (2007), p. 37–9 } Most Meccans ignored him and mocked him, while a few others became his followers. There were three main groups of early converts to Islam: younger brothers and sons of great merchants; people who had fallen out of the first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it; and the weak, mostly unprotected foreigners. { Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam (1977), p. 36. } { ayah from the } { sura } { An-Najm in the Quran: &quot; So prostrate to Allah and worship [Him]. &quot; Muhammad&apos;s message of } { monotheism (one God) challenged the traditional order. } According to Ibn Sad, the opposition in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship and the Meccan forefathers who engaged in polytheism. { F. E. Peters (1994), p.169 } However, the Quranic exegesis maintains that it began as soon as Muhammad started public preaching. { Uri Rubin, Quraysh, } { Encyclopaedia of the Qur&apos;an } As the number of followers increased, he became a threat to the local tribes and the rulers of the city, whose wealth rested upon the Kaaba, the focal point of Meccan religious life, which Muhammad threatened to overthrow. Muhammad’s denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the Quraysh, as they were the guardians of the Ka&apos;aba. The powerful merchants tried to convince Muhammad to abandon his preaching by offering him admission into the inner circle of merchants, and establishing his position therein by an advantageous marriage. However, he refused. Tradition records at great length the persecution and ill-treatment of Muhammad and his followers. Sumayyah bint Khabbab, a slave of a prominent Meccan leader Abu Jahl, is famous as the first martyr of Islam, having been killed with a spear by her master when she refused to give up her faith. Bilal, another Muslim slave, was tortured by Umayyah ibn Khalaf who placed a heavy rock on his chest to force his conversion. { Jonathan E. Brockopp, Slaves and Slavery, } { Encyclopedia of the Qur&apos;an } { W. Arafat, Bilal b. Rabah, } { Encyclopedia of Islam } Apart from insults, Muhammad was protected from physical harm as he belonged to the Banu Hashim clan. { Watt (1964) p. 76. } { Peters (1999) p. 172. } In 615, some of Muhammad&apos;s followers emigrated to the Ethiopia n Aksumite Empire and founded a small colony there under the protection of the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar. Muhammad desperately hoping for an accommodation with his tribe, either from fear or in the hope of succeeding more readily in this way, pronounced a verse acknowledging the existence of three Meccan goddesses considered to be the daughters of Allah, and appealing for their intercession. Muhammad later retracted the verses at the behest of Gabriel, claiming that the verses were whispered by the devil himself. { The Cambridge companion to Muhammad (2010), p.35 } { The aforementioned Islamic } { histories recount that as Muhammad was reciting Sūra Al-Najm (Q.53), as revealed to him by the } { Archangel Gabriel, Satan tempted him to utter the following lines after verses 19 and 20: &quot; Have you thought of Allāt and al-&apos;Uzzā and Manāt the third, the other; These are the exalted Gharaniq, whose intercession is hoped for. &quot; (Allāt, al-&apos;Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshiped by the Meccans). cf Ibn Ishaq, A. Guillaume p. 166. } This episode known as &quot; The Story of the Cranes &quot; (translation: قصة الغرانيق, transliteration: Qissat al Gharaneeq) is also known as &quot; Satanic Verses &quot;. Some scholars argued against its historicity on various grounds. { Kuran, } { Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd Edition, Vol. 5 (1986), p. 404 } While this incident got widespread acceptance by early Muslims, strong objections to it were raised starting from the tenth century, on theological grounds. The objections continued to be raised to the point where the rejection of the historicity of the incident eventually became the only acceptable orthodox Muslim position. { Shahab Ahmed, Satanic Verses, } { Encyclopedia of the Qur&apos;an } In 617, the leaders of Makhzum and Banu Abd-Shams, two important Quraysh clans, declared a public boycott against Banu Hashim, their commercial rival, to pressure it into withdrawing its protection of Muhammad. The boycott lasted three years but eventually collapsed as it failed in its objective. { F. E. Peters (2003b), p. 96 } { Moojan Momen (1985), p. 4 } During this, Muhammad was only able to preach during the holy pilgrimage months in which all hostilities between Arabs were suspended. { An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.186 } [ Isra and Mi&apos;raj ] [ Isra and Mi&apos;raj ] { Al-Aqsa Mosque, part of the } { al-Haram ash-Sharif complex in } { Jerusalem, is believed to be the &quot; farthest mosque &quot; to which Muhammad travelled in his night journey.

In the first part of the journey, the Isra, he is said to have travelled from Mecca on a winged steed (Buraq) to &quot; the farthest mosque &quot; (in Arabic: masjid al-aqsa), which Muslims usually identify with the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. In the second part, the Mi&apos;raj, Muhammad is said to have toured heaven and hell, and spoken with earlier prophets, such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Ibn Ishaq, author of the first biography of Muhammad, presents this event as a spiritual experience whereas later historians like Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir present it as a physical journey. { Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World (2003), p. 482 } { Dome of the Rock, adjacent to the } { Al-Aqsa Mosque in the } { al-Haram ash-Sharif.

Ascension, } { Encyclopedia of the Quran. } [ Last years in Mecca before Hijra ] Muhammad&apos;s wife Khadijah and his uncle Abu Talib both died in 619, the year thus being known as the &quot; year of sorrow &quot;. With the death of Abu Talib, the leadership of the Banu Hashim clan was passed to Abu Lahab, an inveterate enemy of Muhammad. Soon afterwards, Abu Lahab withdrew the clan&apos;s protection from Muhammad. This placed Muhammad in danger of death since the withdrawal of clan protection implied that the blood revenge for his killing would not be exacted. Muhammad then visited Ta&apos;if, another important city in Arabia, and tried to find a protector for himself there, but his effort failed and further brought him into physical danger. Muhammad was forced to return to Mecca. A Meccan man named Mut&apos;im b. Adi (and the protection of the tribe of Banu Nawfal ) made it possible for him safely to re-enter his native city. { Many people were visiting Mecca on business or as pilgrims to the } { Kaaba. Muhammad took this opportunity to look for a new home for himself and his followers. After several unsuccessful negotiations, he found hope with some men from Yathrib (later called } { Medina ). The Arab population of Yathrib were familiar with monotheism and prepared for the appearance of a prophet because a Jewish community existed there. They also hoped by the means of Muhammad and the new faith to gain supremacy over Mecca, as they were jealous of its importance as the place of pilgrimage. Converts to Islam came from nearly all } { Arab tribes in Medina, such that by June of the subsequent year there were seventy-five Muslims coming to Mecca for pilgrimage and to meet Muhammad. Meeting him secretly by night, the group made what was known as the &quot; } { Second Pledge of al-`Aqaba &quot;, or the &quot; Pledge of War &quot; Watt (1974) p. 83 } { Following the pledges at Aqabah, Muhammad encouraged his followers to } { emigrate to } { Yathrib. As with the } { migration to Abyssinia, the Quraysh attempted to stop the emigration. However, almost all Muslims managed to leave. Peterson (2006), pg. 86-9 } [ Hijra ] [ Hijra (Islam) ] The Hijra is the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE. In September 622, warned of a plot to assassinate him, Muhammad secretly slipped out of Mecca, moving with his followers to Medina, 320 kilometres (200  mi) north of Mecca. The Hijra is celebrated annually on the first day of the Muslim year. [ Migration to Medina ] [ Muhammad in Medina ] A delegation consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad as a neutral outsider to Medina to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community. { Esposito (1998), p. 17. } There was fighting in Yathrib mainly involving its Arab and Jewish inhabitants for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu&apos;ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal conceptions of blood-feud and an eye for an eye were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. { Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam, p. 39 } The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves. Muhammad instructed his followers to emigrate to Medina until virtually all his followers left Mecca. Being alarmed at the departure of Muslims, according to the tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate Muhammad. With the help of Ali, Muhammad fooled the Meccans who were watching him, and secretly slipped away from the town with Abu Bakr. { Moojan Momen (1985), p. 5 } By 622, Muhammad emigrated to Medina, a large agricultural oasis. Those who migrated from Mecca along with Muhammad became known as muhajirun (emigrants). [ Establishment of a new polity ] [ Medina Charter ] [ Constitution of Medina ] [ left &lt; center &gt; God!There is no god but He,the Living, the Everlasting.Slumber seizes Him not, neither sleep;to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth.Who is there that shall intercede with Him save by His leave?He knows what lies before them and what is after them,and they comprehend not anything of His knowledgesave such as He wills.His Throne comprises the heavens and earth;the preserving of them oppresses Him not;He is the All-high, the All-glorious. &lt; /center &gt; ] Among the first things Muhammad did to settle down the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was drafting a document known as the Constitution of Medina, &quot; establishing a kind of alliance or federation &quot; among the eight Medinan tribes and Muslim emigrants from Mecca, which specified the rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship of the different communities in Medina (including that of the Muslim community to other communities, specifically the Jew s and other &quot; Peoples of the Book &quot; ). The community defined in the Constitution of Medina, Ummah, had a religious outlook but was also shaped by practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old Arab tribes. It effectively established the first Islamic state. Several ordinances were proclaimed to win over the numerous and wealthy Jewish population. But these were soon rescinded as the Jews insisted on preserving the entire Mosaic law, and did not recognize him as a prophet because he was not of the race of David. The first group of pagan converts to Islam in Medina were the clans who had not produced great leaders for themselves but had suffered from warlike leaders from other clans. This was followed by the general acceptance of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, apart from some exceptions. According to Ibn Ishaq, this was influenced by the conversion of Sa&apos;d ibn Mu&apos;adh (a prominent Medinan leader) to Islam. { Watt (1956), p. 175, p. 177. } Those Medinans who converted to Islam and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.

As he adjusted himself, so did his companions praying with him, beginning the tradition of facing Mecca during prayer. [ William Montgomery Watt Muhammad: prophet and statesman http://books.google.com/books?id%3DzLN2hNidLw4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA113 29 December 2011 7 February 1974 Oxford University Press 978-0-19-881078-0 112–114 ] According to Watt, the change may have been less sudden and definite than the story suggests – the related Quranic verses ( [ 2 136 ns n ] – [ 2 147 ns n ] ) appear to have been revealed at different times – and correlates with changes in Muhammad&apos;s political support base, symbolizing his turning away from Jews and adopting a more Arabian outlook. In March 624, Muhammad led some three hundred warriors in a raid on a Meccan merchant caravan. The Muslims set an ambush for them at Badr. { Rodinson (2002), p. 164. } Aware of the plan, the Meccan caravan eluded the Muslims. Meanwhile, a force from Mecca was sent to protect the caravan, continuing forward to confront the Muslims upon hearing that the caravan was safe. The Battle of Badr began in March 624. { Watt, The Cambridge History of Islam, p. 45 } Though outnumbered more than three to one, the Muslims won the battle, killing at least forty-five Meccans with only fourteen Muslims dead. They also succeeded in killing many Meccan leaders, including Abu Jahl. { Glubb (2002), pp. 179–186. } Seventy prisoners had been acquired, many of whom were soon ransomed in return for wealth or freed. { Watt (1961), p. 123. } { Rodinson (2002), pp. 168–9. } Muhammad and his followers saw in the victory a confirmation of their faith as Muhammad ascribed the victory to the assistance of an invisible host of angels. { An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.188 - 189 } The Quranic verses of this period, unlike the Meccan ones, dealt with practical problems of government and issues like the distribution of spoils. { Lewis(2002), p. 44 } { An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.189 } The victory strengthened Muhammad&apos;s position in Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his followers. { Russ Rodgers, The Generalship of Muhammad: Battles and Campaigns of the Prophet of Allah (University Press of Florida; 2012) ch 1 } As a result the opposition to him became less vocal. Pagans who had not yet converted were very bitter about the advance of Islam. Two pagans, Asma bint Marwan and Abu &apos;Afak, had composed verses taunting and insulting the Muslims. They were killed by people belonging to their own or related clans, and no blood-feud followed. { Watt (1956), p. 179. } Muhammad expelled from Medina the Banu Qaynuqa, one of three main Jewish tribes. Although Muhammad wanted them executed, Abd-Allah ibn Ubaiy chief of the Khazraj tribe did not agree and they were expelled to Syria but without their property. Following the Battle of Badr, Muhammad also made mutual-aid alliances with a number of Bedouin tribes to protect his community from attacks from the northern part of Hijaz.

To maintain their economic prosperity, the Meccans needed to restore their prestige, which had been lost at Badr. { Watt (1961), p. 132. } In the ensuing months, the Meccans sent ambush parties on Medina while Muhammad led expeditions on tribes allied with Mecca and sent out a raid on a Meccan caravan. { Watt (1961), p. 134 } Abu Sufyan subsequently gathered an army of three thousand men and set out for an attack on Medina. { Lewis (1960), p. 45. } A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army&apos;s presence and numbers a day later. The next morning, at the Muslim conference of war, there was dispute over how best to repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle. Thus, Muhammad led his force outside to the mountain of Uhud (where the Meccans had camped) and fought the Battle of Uhud on March 23. { C.F. Robinson, Uhud, } { Encyclopedia of Islam } { Watt (1964) p. 137 } Although the Muslim army had the best of the early encounters, indiscipline on the part of strategically placed archers led to a Muslim defeat, with 75 Muslims killed including Hamza, Muhammad&apos;s uncle and one of the best known martyrs in the Muslim tradition. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims further, but marched back to Mecca declaring victory. This is probably because Muhammad was wounded and thought to be dead. When they knew this on their way back, they did not return back because of false information about new forces coming to his aid. They were not entirely successful, however, as they had failed to achieve their aim of completely destroying the Muslims. { Watt (1974) p. 137 } { David Cook(2007), p.24 } The Muslims buried the dead, and returned to Medina that evening. Questions accumulated as to the reasons for the loss, and Muhammad subsequently delivered Quranic verses [ 3 152 ns n ] which indicated that their defeat was partly a punishment for disobedience and partly a test for steadfastness. See: Watt (1981) p. 432; Watt (1964) p. 144. Abu Sufyan now directed his efforts towards another attack on Medina. He attracted the support of nomadic tribes to the north and east of Medina, using propaganda about Muhammad&apos;s weakness, promises of booty, memories of the prestige of the Quraysh and use of bribes. { Watt (1956), p. 30. } Muhammad&apos;s policy was now to prevent alliances against him as much as he could. Whenever alliances of tribesmen against Medina were formed, he sent out an expedition to break them up. When Muhammad heard of men massing with hostile intentions against Medina, he reacted with severity. { Watt (1956), p. 34 } One example is the assassination of Ka&apos;b ibn al-Ashraf, a chieftain of the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir who had gone to Mecca and written poems that helped rouse the Meccans&apos; grief, anger and desire for revenge after the Battle of Badr. { Watt (1956), p. 18 } [ Rubin Uri 1990 The Assassination of Kaʿb b. al-Ashraf Oriens 32 1 65–71 1580625 10.2307/1580625 ] Around a year later, Muhammad expelled the Banu Nadir from Medina { Watt (1956), pp. 220–221 } to Syria allowing them to take some of their possessions because he was unable to subdue them in their strongholds. The rest of their property was claimed by Muhammad in the name of God because it was not gained with bloodshed. Muhammad surprised various Arab tribes, one by one, with overwhelming force which caused his enemies to unite to annihilate him. { An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.190 } Muhammad&apos;s attempts to prevent formation of a confederation against him were unsuccessful, though he was able to increase his own forces and stop many potential tribes from joining his enemies. { Watt (1956), p. 35 } [ Siege of Medina ] [ Battle of the Trench ] [ right &lt; center &gt; Allah is the Lightof the heavens and the earth.The Parable of His Light isas if there were a Nicheand within it a Lamp:the Lamp enclosed in Glass:the glass as it were a brilliant star:Lit from a blessed Tree, an Olive,neither of the east nor of the west,whose oil is well-nigh luminous,though fire scarce touched it:Light upon Light!Allah doth guide whom He will to His Light:Allah doth set forth Parables for men:and Allah doth know all things. &lt; /center &gt; ] With the help of the exiled Banu Nadir, the Quraysh military leader Abu Sufyan had mustered a force of 10,000 men. Muhammad prepared a force of about 3,000 men and adopted a new form of defense unknown in Arabia at that time: the Muslims dug a trench wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, Salman the Persian. The siege of Medina began on March 31 627 and lasted for two weeks. { Watt (1956), p. 36, 37 } Abu Sufyan&apos;s troops were unprepared for the fortifications they were confronted with, and after an ineffectual siege lasting several weeks, the coalition decided to go home. See: Rodinson (2002), pp. 209–211; Watt (1964) p. 169 The Quran discusses this battle in sura Al-Ahzab, ayat (verses) 9-27, [ 33 9 27 ns n ]. During the battle, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza, located at the south of Medina, had entered into negotiations with Meccan forces to revolt against Muhammad. Although they were swayed by suggestions that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed, they desired reassurance in case the confederacy was unable to destroy him. No agreement was reached after the prolonged negotiations, in part due to sabotage attempts by Muhammad&apos;s scouts. { Watt (1964) pp. 170–172 } After the coalition&apos;s retreat, the Muslims accused the Banu Qurayza of treachery and besieged them in their forts for 25 days. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered; according to Ibn Ishaq, all the men apart from a few who converted to Islam were beheaded, while the women and children were enslaved. { Peterson(2007), p. 126 } { Ramadan (2007), p. 141 } Walid N. Arafat and Barakat Ahmad have disputed the accuracy of Ibn Ishaq &quot; s narrative, however. { Meri, Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia, p. 754. } Arafat believes that Ibn Ishaq&apos;s Jewish sources, speaking over 100 years after the event, conflated their account with memories of earlier massacres in Jewish history; he notes that Ibn Ishaq was considered an unreliable historian by his contemporary Malik ibn Anas, and a transmitter of &quot; odd tales &quot; by the later Ibn Hajar. { Arafat, &quot; New Light on the Story of Banu Qurayza and the Jews of Medina &quot;, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1976, p. 100–107. } Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe were killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved. { Ahmad, p. 85-94. } { Nemoy, &quot; Barakat Ahmad&apos;s &quot; Muhammad and the Jews &quot; &quot;, p. 325. Nemoy is sourcing Ahmad&apos;s Muhammad and the Jews. } Watt finds Arafat&apos;s arguments &quot; not entirely convincing &quot;, while Meir J. Kister has contradicted [ March 2009 ] the arguments of Arafat and Ahmad. { Kister, &quot; The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza &quot;. } In the siege of Medina, the Meccans exerted their utmost strength towards the destruction of the Muslim community. Their failure resulted in a significant loss of prestige; their trade with Syria was gone. { Watt (1956), p. 39 } Following the Battle of the Trench, he made two expeditions to the north which ended without any fighting. While returning from one of these (or some years earlier according to other early accounts), an accusation of adultery was made against Aisha, Muhammad&apos;s wife. Aisha was exonerated from the accusations when Muhammad announced that he had received a revelation confirming Aisha&apos;s innocence and directing that charges of adultery be supported by four eyewitnesses (sura 24, An-Nur ). [ Truce of Hudaybiyyah ] [ Treaty of Hudaybiyyah ] Although Muhammad had already delivered Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, [ 2 196 210 ns ] the Muslims had not performed it due to the enmity of the Quraysh. In the month of Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and to make preparations for a pilgrimage ( umrah ) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision where he was shaving his head after the completion of the Hajj. { Lings (1987), p. 249 } Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh sent out a force of 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, thereby reaching al-Hudaybiyya, just outside of Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad&apos;s decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was at the same time demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam does not threaten the prestige of their sanctuary, and that Islam was an Arabian religion. { Watt, al- Hudaybiya or al-Hudaybiyya } { Encyclopedia of Islam } Imprint of Muhammad&apos;s seal, used in letters sent to other heads of state. Negotiations commenced with emissaries going to and from Mecca. While these continued, rumors spread that one of the Muslim negotiators, Uthman bin al-Affan, had been killed by the Quraysh. Muhammad responded by calling upon the pilgrims to make a pledge not to flee (or to stick with Muhammad, whatever decision he made) if the situation descended into war with Mecca. This pledge became known as the &quot; Pledge of Acceptance &quot; ( [ بيعة الرضوان, bay&apos;at al-ridhwān ] ) or the &quot; Pledge under the Tree &quot;. News of Uthman&apos;s safety, however, allowed for negotiations to continue, and a treaty scheduled to last ten years was eventually signed between the Muslims and Quraysh. { Lewis (2002), p. 42. } The main points of the treaty included the cessation of hostilities; the deferral of Muhammad&apos;s pilgrimage to the following year; { An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p.191 } and an agreement to send back any Meccan who had gone to Medina without the permission of their protector. Many Muslims were not satisfied with the terms of the treaty. However, the Quranic sura &quot; Al-Fath &quot; (The Victory) (Quran [ 48 1 29 ns n ] ) assured the Muslims that the expedition from which they were now returning must be considered a victorious one. { Lings (1987), p. 255 } It was only later that Muhammad&apos;s followers would realise the benefit behind this treaty. These benefits included the inducing of the Meccans to recognise Muhammad as an equal; a cessation of military activity posing well for the future; and gaining the admiration of Meccans who were impressed by the incorporation of the pilgrimage rituals. After signing the truce, Muhammad made an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, known as the Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to it housing the Banu Nadir, who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain some prestige to deflect from what appeared to some Muslims as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. { Vaglieri, Khaybar, Encyclopedia of Islam } According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers of the world, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). { Lings (1987), p. 260 } { Khan (1998), pp. 250–251 } { An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.273 } Hence he sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad sent his forces against the Arabs on Transjordania n Byzantine soil in the Battle of Mu&apos;tah, in which the Muslims were defeated. { F. Buhl, Muta, } { Encyclopedia of Islam } [ Final years ] [ Conquest of Mecca ] [ Conquest of Mecca Muhammad after the conquest of Mecca ] { Siyer-i Nebi, a 16th-century } { Ottoman manuscript.

A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza&apos;a, killing a few of them. The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting. After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were that either the Meccans paid blood money for those slain among the Khuza&apos;ah tribe; or, that they should disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr; or, that they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null. { Khan (1998), pp. 274–5. } The Meccans replied that they would accept only the last condition. However, soon they realized their mistake and sent Abu Sufyan to renew the Hudaybiyyah treaty, but now his request was declined by Muhammad. Muhammad began to prepare for a campaign. { Lings (1987), p. 292 } In 630, Muhammad marched on Mecca with an enormous force, said to number more than ten thousand men. With minimal casualties, Muhammad took control of Mecca. { Watt (1956), p. 66. } { An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.274 } He declared an amnesty for past offences, except for ten men and women who were &quot; guilty of murder or other offences or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace &quot;. { The Message by Ayatullah Ja&apos;far Subhani, chapter 48 referencing Sirah by } { Ibn Hisham, vol. II, page 409. } Some of these were later pardoned. { Rodinson (2002), p. 261. } Most Meccans converted to Islam and Muhammad subsequently had destroyed all the statues of Arabian gods in and around the Kaaba. { Harold Wayne Ballard, Donald N. Penny, W. Glenn Jonas (2002), p.163 } { F. E. Peters (2003), p.240 } According to reports collected by Ibn Ishaq and al-Azraqi, Muhammad personally spared paintings or frescos of Mary and Jesus, but other traditions suggest that all pictures were erased.

[ 110 1 3 ns ] [ Conquest of Arabia ] [ Battle of Hunayn Battle of Tabouk ] Soon after the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a military threat from the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were collecting an army twice the size of Muhammad&apos;s. The Banu Hawazin were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta&apos;if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to the decline of the prestige of Meccans. { Watt (1974), p.207 } Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn. { An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.275 } In the same year, Muhammad made the expedition of Tabuk against northern Arabia because of their previous defeat at the Battle of Mu&apos;tah as well as reports of the hostile attitude adopted against Muslims. With the greatest difficulty he collected thirty thousand men, half of whom, however, on the second day after their departure from Mecca, returned with Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, untroubled by the damning verses which Muhammad hurled at them. { An Introduction to the Quran II (1895), p.276 } Although Muhammad did not make contact with hostile forces at Tabuk, he received the submission of some local chiefs of the region. { M.A. al-Bakhit, Tabuk, } { Encyclopedia of Islam } He also ordered the destruction of remaining pagan idols in Eastern Arabia. The last city to hold out against the Muslims in Eastern Arabia was Taif. Muhammad refused to accept the surrender of the city until they agreed to convert to Islam and let his men destroy their statue of their goddess Allat. { Ibn Ishaq (translated by Guillaume, A. 1955) The Life of Muhammad.

Many bedouins submitted to Muhammad to be safe against his attacks and to benefit from the booties of the wars. However, the bedouins were alien to the system of Islam and wanted to maintain their independence, their established code of virtue and their ancestral traditions. Muhammad thus required of them a military and political agreement according to which they &quot; acknowledge the suzerainty of Medina, to refrain from attack on the Muslims and their allies, and to pay the Zakat, the Muslim religious levy. &quot; { Lewis (1993), pp.43–44 } [ Farewell pilgrimage ] { al-Bīrūnī &apos;s &apos;&apos; } { The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries &apos;&apos;, depicting Muhammad } { prohibiting intercalary months during } { the Farewell Pilgrimage, C17th Ottoman copy of a C14th ( } { Ilkhanate ) manuscript (Edinburgh codex). } [ The Farewell Pilgrimage ] In 632, at the end of the tenth year after the migration to Medina, Muhammad carried through his first truly Islamic pilgrimage, thereby teaching his followers the rites of the annual Great Pilgrimage (Hajj). After completing the pilgrimage, Muhammad delivered a famous speech known as The Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. He declared that an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action. [ Sultan Sohaib The Koran For Dummies John Wiley &amp; Sons 2011 March 0-7645-5581-2 ] He abolished all old blood feud s and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for all old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammed asked his male followers to “Be good to women; for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God’s trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear my words...” He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased, and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. { Devin J.

[ Rashidun Muslim conquest Succession to Muhammad ] Muhammad united the tribes of Arabia into a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life. With Muhammad&apos;s death, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, Muhammad&apos;s friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad&apos;s companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated the successor by Muhammad at Ghadir Khumm. Abu Bakr&apos;s immediate task was to make an expedition against the Byzantine (or Eastern Roman Empire ) forces because of the previous defeat, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode referred to by later Muslim historians as the Ridda wars, or &quot; Wars of Apostasy &quot;. See: Holt (1977a), p.57 Hourani (2003), p.22 Lapidus (2002), p.32 Esposito(1998), p.36 Madelung (1996), p.43 The pre-Islamic Middle East was dominated by the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. The Roman-Persian Wars between the two had devastated the region, making the empires unpopular amongst local tribes. Furthermore, in the lands that would be conquered by Muslims many Christians ( Nestorian s, Monophysite s, Jacobites and Copt s ) were disaffected from the Christian Orthodoxy which deemed them heretics. Within only a decade, Muslims conquered Mesopotamia and Persia, Byzantine Syria and Byzantine Egypt. { Esposito (1998), p.35–36 } and established the Rashidun empire. [ Early reforms under Islam ] [ Early reforms under Islam ] According to William Montgomery Watt, for Muhammad, religion was not a private and individual matter but rather “the total response of his personality to the total situation in which he found himself. He was responding &amp; #91;not only &amp; #93;… to the religious and intellectual aspects of the situation but also to the economic, social, and political pressures to which contemporary Mecca was subject. &quot; { Cambridge History of Islam (1970), p. 30. } Bernard Lewis says that there are two important political traditions in Islam – one that views Muhammad as a statesman in Medina, and another that views him as a rebel in Mecca. He sees Islam itself as a type of revolution that greatly changed the societies into which the new religion was brought. { Lewis (1998) } Historians generally agree that Islamic social reforms in areas such as social security, family structure, slavery and the rights of women and children improved on the status quo of Arab society.

Muhammad is said to have had thirteen wives or concubines. (There are differing accounts on the status of some of them as wife or concubine. { See for example Marco Schöller, Banu Qurayza, } { Encyclopedia of the Quran mentioning the differing accounts of the status of } { Rayhana } ) { Barbara Freyer Stowasser, Wives of the Prophet, } { Encyclopedia of the Quran } All but two of his marriages were contracted after the migration to Medina.

[ Subhani Jafar The Message http://www.al-islam.org/message Ansariyan Publications, Qom Chapter 9 ] The marriage lasted for 25  years and was a happy one. { Esposito (1998), p. 18 } Muhammad relied upon Khadija in many ways and did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. { Bullough (1998), p. 119 } { Reeves (2003), p. 46 } After the death of Khadija, it was suggested to Muhammad by Khawla bint Hakim that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad is said to have asked her to arrange for him to marry both. { Watt, Aisha, } { Encyclopedia of Islam } Traditional sources dictate that Aisha was six or seven years old when betrothed to Muhammad, { D.

He is also said to have had accustomed his wives to dialogue; he listened to their advice, and the wives debated and even argued with him. { Tariq Ramadan (2007), p. 168–9 } { Asma Barlas (2002), p. 125 } { Armstrong (1992), p. 157 } Khadijah is said to have had four daughters with Muhammad —( Ruqayyah bint Muhammad, Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad, Zainab bint Muhammad, Fatimah Zahra )—and two sons—( Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad and Qasim ibn Muhammad )—who both died in childhood. All except two of his daughters, Fatimah and Zainab, died before him.

Aisha, who became known as Muhammad&apos;s favourite wife in Sunni tradition, survived him by many decades and was instrumental in helping bring together the scattered sayings of Muhammad that would form the Hadith literature for the Sunni branch of Islam. Muhammad&apos;s descendants through Fatimah are known as sharif s, syeds or sayyid s. These are honorific titles in Arabic, sharif meaning &apos;noble&apos; and sayed or sayyid meaning &apos;lord&apos; or &apos;sir&apos;. As Muhammad&apos;s only descendants, they are respected by both Sunni and Shi&apos;a, though the Shi&apos;a place much more emphasis and value on their distinction.

Every Muslim proclaims in the Shahadah that &quot; I testify that there is none worthy of worship except God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God &quot;. The Shahadah is the basic creed or tenet of Islam. Ideally, it is the first words a newborn will hear, and children are taught as soon as they are able to understand it and it will be recited when they die. Muslims must repeat the shahadah in the call to prayer ( adhan ) and the prayer itself. Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed. { Farah (1994), p.135 } According to the Quran, Muhammad is only the last of a series of Prophets sent by God for the benefit of mankind, and commands Muslims to make no distinction between them. [ 10 37 ns ] states that &quot;...it (the Quran) is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from The Lord of the Worlds. &quot;. Similarly [ 46 12 ns ] states &quot;...And before this was the book of Moses, as a guide and a mercy. And this Book confirms (it)... &quot;, while [ 2 136 ns n ] commands the believers of Islam to &quot; Say: we believe in God and that which is revealed unto us, and that which was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered. &quot; Historian Denis Gril believes that the Quran does not overtly describe Muhammad performing miracles, and the supreme miracle of Muhammad is finally identified with the Quran itself. { Denis Gril, Miracles, } { Encyclopedia of the Qur&apos;an } However, Muslim tradition credits Muhammad with several miracles or supernatural events. { A.J. Wensinck, Muʿd̲j̲iza, } { Encyclopedia of Islam } For example, many Muslim commentators and some Western scholars have interpreted the Surah [ 54 1 2 ns n ] as referring to Muhammad splitting the Moon in view of the Quraysh when they began persecuting his followers. { Daniel Martin Varisco, Moon, } { Encyclopedia of the Qur&apos;an } The Sunnah represents the actions and sayings of Muhammad (preserved in reports known as Hadith ), and covers a broad array of activities and beliefs ranging from religious rituals, personal hygiene, burial of the dead to the mystical questions involving the love between humans and God. The Sunnah is considered a model of emulation for pious Muslims and has to a great degree influenced the Muslim culture. The greeting that Muhammad taught Muslims to offer each other, “may peace be upon you” (Arabic: as-salamu `alaykum ) is used by Muslims throughout the world. Many details of major Islamic rituals such as daily prayers, the fasting and the annual pilgrimage are only found in the Sunnah and not the Quran. { Muhammad, Encyclopædia Britannica, p.9 } The Sunnah also played a major role in the development of the Islamic sciences. It contributed much to the development of Islamic law, particularly from the end of the first Islamic century. { J. Schacht, Fiḳh, Encyclopedia of Islam } Muslim mystics, known as sufi s, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the prophet of Islam not only as a prophet but also as a perfect saint.

Stories of Muhammad&apos;s life, his intercession and of his miracles (particularly &quot; Splitting of the moon &quot; ) have permeated popular Muslim thought and poetry. Among Arabic odes to Muhammad, the Qaṣīda al-Burda ( &quot; Poem of the Mantle &quot; ) by the Egyptian Sufi al-Busiri (1211–1294) is particularly well known, and widely held to possess a healing, spiritual power.

The association of rain with mercy in Oriental countries has led to imagining Muhammad as a rain cloud dispensing blessings and stretching over lands, reviving the dead hearts, just as rain revives the seemingly dead earth (see, for example, the Sindhi poem of Shah ʿAbd al-Latif). Muhammad&apos;s birthday is celebrated as a major feast throughout the Islamic world, excluding Wahhabi -dominated Saudi Arabia where these public celebrations are discouraged. { Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Encyclopædia Britannica, Muhammad, p.13 } When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad or any other prophet in Islam, they usually follow it with Peace be upon him (Arabic: sallAllahu `alayhi wa sallam). In casual writing, this is sometimes abbreviated as PBUH or SAW; in printed matter, a small calligraphic rendition is commonly used instead of printing the entire phrase.

They have, until recently [ January 2012 ], mostly been limited to the private and elite medium of the miniature, and since about 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.

Influenced by the Buddhist tradition of representational religious art predating the Mongol elite&apos;s conversion, this innovation was unprecedented in the Islamic world, and accompanied by a &quot; broader shift in Islamic artistic culture away from abstraction toward representation &quot; in &quot; mosques, on tapestries, silks, ceramics, and in glass and metalwork &quot; besides books.

The Safavaids, who made Shi&apos;i Islam the state religion, initiated a departure from the traditional Ilkhanid and Timurid artistic style by covering Muhammad&apos;s face with a veil to obscure his features and at the same time represent his luminous essence.

I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle. When I closed the second volume (of the Prophet&apos;s biography), I was sorry there was not more for me to read of that great life. [ European and Western views ] [ Medieval Christian views on Muhammad ] According to Hossein Nasr, earliest European literature often refers to Muhammad unfavorably. He has been maligned in various European sources for over a millennium. [ Nasr S. Hossein 2002 The Heart of Islam: Enduring Values for Humanity HarperOne USA 27 978-0-06-009924-4 ] A few learned circles of Middle Ages Europe —primarily Latin-literate scholars —had access to fairly extensive biographical material abo ut Muhammad. They interpreted that information through a Christian religious filter that viewed Muhammad as a charlatan driven by ambition and eagerness for power, and who seduced the Saracens into his submission under a religious guise. Popular European literature of the time portrayed Muhammad as though he were worshipped by Muslims in the manner of an idol or a heathen god. Some medieval Christians believed he died in 666, alluding to the number of the beast, instead of his actual death date in 632; { Göran Larsson (2003), p. 87 } others changed his name from Muhammad to Mahound, the &quot; devil incarnate &quot;. { Reeves (2003), p. 3 } Bernard Lewis writes &quot; The development of the concept of Mahound started with considering Muhammad as a kind of demon or false god worshipped with Apollyon and Termagant in an unholy trinity. &quot; { Lewis (2002) p. 45. } A later medieval work, Livre dou Tresor represents Muhammad as a former monk and cardinal. Dante&apos;s Divine Comedy (Canto XXVIII ), puts Muhammad, together with Ali, in Hell &quot; among the sowers of discord and the schismatics, being lacerated by devils again and again. &quot; Cultural critic and author Edward Said wrote in Orientalism regarding Dante&apos;s depiction of Muhammad: Empirical data about the Orient...count for very little;... What... Dante tried to do in the Inferno, is... to characterize the Orient as alien and to incorporate it schematically on a theatrical stage whose audience, manager, and actors are... only for Europe. Hence the vacillation between the familiar and the alien; Mohammed is always the imposter (familiar, because he pretends to be like the Jesus we know) and always the Oriental (alien, because although he is in some ways &quot; like &quot; Jesus, he is after all not like him). [ Said, Edward W Orientalism Penguin 2003 0-14-118742-5, 9780141187426 http://books.google.com/?id%3DzvJ3YwOkZAYC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3Dorientalism%26amp%3Bcd%3D3#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq 68 ] After the reformation, Muhammad was often portrayed as a cunning and ambitious impostor. Guillaume Postel was among the first to present a more positive view of Muhammad. Boulainvilliers described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker. Gottfried Leibniz praised Muhammad because &quot; he did not deviate from the natural religion &quot;. Thomas Carlyle in his book Heroes and Hero Worship and the Heroic in History (1840) defines Muhammed as &quot; A silent great soul, one of that who cannot but be earnest &quot;. { On heroes and hero worship by Thomas Carlyle } Edward Gibbon in his book The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire observes that &quot; the good sense of Mohammad despised the pomp of royalty. &quot; Friedrich Martin von Bodenstedt (1851) described Muhammad as &quot; an ominous destroyer and a prophet of murder. &quot; Simon Ockley wrote in his book The History of the Saracen Empires (1718); The greatest success of Mohammad’s life was effected by sheer moral force...It is not the propagation but the permanency of his religion that deserves our wonder, the same pure and perfect impression which he engraved at Mecca and Medina is preserved, after the revolutions of twelve centuries by the Indian, the African and the Turkish proselytes of the Koran... The Mahometans have uniformly withstood the temptation of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to a level with the senses and imagination of man. &apos;I believe in One God and Mahomet the Apostle of God&apos; is the simple and invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honours of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue, and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion. { Edward Gibbon and Simon Ockley, } { THE HISTORTY OF THE SARACEN EMPIRES, London, 1870, p. 54. } { Russia n artist } { Grigory Gagarin } Reverend Benjamin Bosworth Smith in his book Muhammad and Muhammadanism (1874) commented that;...if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by the right divine, it was Mohammed, for he had all the power without its instruments and without its supports. He cared not for the dressings of power. The simplicity of his private life was in keeping with his public life...In Mohammadanism every thing is different here. Instead of the shadowy and the mysterious, we have history....We know of the external history of Muhammad....while for his internal history after his mission had been proclaimed, we have a book absolutely unique in its origin, in its preservation....on the Substantial authority of which no one has ever been able to cast a serious doubt. { Reverend Bosworth Smith, MOHAMMAD AND MOHAMMADANISM, London, 1874, p. 92. } Alphonse de Lamartine quoted in Histoire de la Turquie (1854) on Muhammad; If greatness of purpose, smallness of means and outstanding results are the three criteria of human genius, who could dare compare any great man in modern history with Muhammad. { L&apos;histoire de la Turquie, 1854, vol II, p.276 } Never has a man proposed for himself, voluntarily or involuntarily, a goal more sublime, since this goal was beyond measure: undermine the superstitions placed between the creature and the Creator, give back God to man and man to God, reinstate the rational and saintly idea of divinity in the midst of this prevailing chaos of material and disfigured gods of idolatry.... The most famous have only moved weapons, laws, empires; they founded, when they founded anything, only material powers, often crumbling before them. This one not only moved armies, legislations, empires, peoples, dynasties, millions of men over a third of the inhabited globe; but he also moved ideas, beliefs, souls. He founded upon a book, of which each letter has become a law, a spiritual nationality embracing people of all languages and races; and made an indelible imprint upon this Muslim world, for the hatred of false gods and the passion for the God, One and Immaterial....Philosopher, orator, apostle, legislator, warrior, conqueror of ideas, restorer of a rational dogma for a cult without imagery, founder of twenty earthly empires and of a spiritual empire, this is Muhammad. { Histoire de la Turquie } Annie Besant in The Life and Teachings of Muhammad (1932) wrote It is impossible for anyone who studies the life and character of the great Prophet of Arabia, who knows how he taught and how he lived, to feel anything but reverence for that mighty Prophet, one of the great messengers of the Supreme... { Annie Besant, THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF MUHAMMAD, Madras, 1932, p. 4. } According to William Montgomery Watt and Richard Bell, recent writers have generally dismissed the idea that Muhammad deliberately deceived his followers, arguing that Muhammad &quot; was absolutely sincere and acted in complete good faith &quot; { Watt, Bell (1995) p. 18 } and that Muhammad’s readiness to endure hardship for his cause when there seemed to be no rational basis for hope shows his sincerity. { Watt (1974), p. 232 } Watt says that sincerity does not directly imply correctness: In contemporary terms, Muhammad might have mistaken his own subconscious for divine revelation. { Watt (1974), p. 17 } Watt and Bernard Lewis argue that viewing Muhammad as a self-seeking impostor makes it impossible to understand the development of Islam. { Watt, The Cambridge history of Islam, p. 37 } { Lewis (1993), p. 45. } Alford T. Welch holds that Muhammad was able to be so influential and successful because of his firm belief in his vocation. Michael H. Hart in his first book The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History (1978), a ranking of the 100 people who most influenced human history, { Michael H. Hart The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History. first published in 1978, reprinted with minor revisions 1992. ISBN 978-0-8065-1068-2 } chose Muhammad as the first person on his list, { The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History } [ January 2012 ] attributing this to the fact that Muhammad was &quot; supremely successful &quot; in both the religious and secular realms. He also credits the authorship of the Quran to Muhammad, making his role in the development of Islam an unparalleled combination of secular and religious influence which entitles Muhammad to be considered the most influential single figure in human history.

Toronto August 2000 Ensign ] Bahá&apos;ís venerate Muhammad as one of a number of prophets or &quot; Manifestations of God &quot;, but consider his teachings to have been superseded by those of Bahá&apos;u&apos;lláh, the founder of the Bahai faith. Muhammad is regarded as one of the Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints neither regards Muhammad as a prophet nor accepts the Quran as a book of scripture. However, it does respect Muhammad as one who taught moral truths which can enlighten nations and bring a higher level of understanding to individuals. [ Criticism ] [ section May 2012 ] [ Criticism of Muhammad ] Criticism of Muhammad has existed since the 7th century, when he was attacked by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism, his marriages, and military expeditions. During the Middle Ages he was frequently demonized in European and other non-Muslim polemics. In modern times, his sincerity in claiming to be a prophet has been questioned, and the laws he established, such as those concerning slavery have been criticised.
