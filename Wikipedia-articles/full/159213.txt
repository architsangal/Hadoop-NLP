Bisset made strides towards becoming a better-known entertainer in America with The Deep (1977), co-starring Robert Shaw and Nick Nolte and directed by Peter Yates, who had previously directed her in Bullitt. A scene of her swimming underwater wearing only a thin, white T-shirt and bikini bottom helped make the film a box office success, leading the producer Peter Guber to say, &quot; That T-shirt made me a rich man &quot;. { Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters, Hit &amp; Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony for A Ride in Hollywood, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996, p. 85. } At the time, Newsweek declared her &quot; the most beautiful film actress of all time. &quot; About that time, a small film Bisset had made six years earlier was re-released in the United States under the title Secrets. That movie featured the only extensive nude scenes of Bisset&apos;s career and the producers cashed in on her fame. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for the comedy Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? (1978). Soon thereafter, she starred in the movies Rich and Famous (1981) with Candice Bergen, Class (1983) (playing a woman who seduces her son&apos;s best friend) co-starring Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy, and Under the Volcano (1984), for which she earned her a second Golden Globe nomination.

Bisset has appeared in many made-for-TV and independent films, especially in recent years. In 1996, she was nominated for a César Award, for her role in La Cérémonie.

[ July 2011 ] She told a Bermuda newspaper in 2004: { &apos;&apos;Bisset Resurfaces: 2004 Bermuda career interview&apos;&apos; } [ October 2010 ] [ This film business, perhaps more so in America than in Europe, has always been about young sexuality. It&apos;s not true of theatre, but in America, film audiences are young and they go to the cinema to see the sort of romance or adventure that appeals to them. It&apos;s not an intellectual cinema in America. But one mustn&apos;t be too greedy. One wants to be stimulated by the work as long as there is something to give. I think you have to be as flexible as possible. Perhaps you don&apos;t get handed the big American productions, but, quite honestly, who would want to be in a lot of them? Many of them are just puerile teenage filler, and they&apos;re not fascinating to be in. To be used in a part without depth is a frustrating feeling, when you know you have something to give, and the camera just sort of brushes past you, and doesn&apos;t get what you have to give. Most actresses I know are frustrated, but you have to adapt to the reality. I go and find a small part in something I find interesting, or find an independent film. &quot; 30px ] Bisset co-starred in the independent film, Latter Days where she played the role of &apos;Lila&apos;. { The Making of &apos;Latter Days&apos; 2003 } Bisset has starred in a large number of independent films throughout her career.

Like many people who don’t easily commit, I think I had a fear of being known; I was not sure there was anybody inside there.” [ http://hollywoodandfine.com/interviews/?p%3D117 Interviews » Blog Archive » Giving thanks for Jacqueline Bisset Hollywood and Fine 21 November 2008 10 October 2010 ] She divides her time between homes in England and Beverly Hills, California.
