[ Shaheem Reid Brandy Gets Love From Kanye, Timbaland On New Album MTV News MTV.com http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486701/20040429/brandy.jhtml 2004-04-29 2010-06-30 ] A four year hiatus, and a few life-changing occurrences caused Norwood to return to the music scene, in late 2008, with Human, her fifth studio album, which lyrically discussed topics of spiritual love, genuine heartache, and universal honesty, and musically explored combining her urban pop sound with elements of country and inspirational pop. [ HumanReview The Guardian http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/05/urban-brandy-norwood-human Alex MacPherson 2008-12-05 2010-04-26 London ] Experiencing a career and personal rejuvenation, Norwood was eager to scale back on her previous pop venture, and return to her authentic R &amp; B, soul sound and love vocalizing on sixth studio album Two Eleven, for summer 2012 release, which would acquire a &quot; gritty &quot; and experimental edge.

[ July 2011 ] Often referred to as “B-Rocka”, her distinctive voice has been commended for its smoky, slightly worn timbre and for the caliber of its colorful tone quality [ May 2012 ]. Josh Love of Stylus Magazine calls her voice “gorgeous” and “un-histrionic”, while Nicolas Paul Godkin of Designer Magazine comments, saying “…her husky, dulcet tones impresses the most.” [ Brandy- Afrodisiac Designer Magazine Tripod.com http://designermagazine.tripod.com/BrandyALBUMREV1.html 2010-06-30 ] Andy Kallman of Allmusic mentions that her voice is a treat to her, and she wears a slightly worn scratchy-ness surprisingly well. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly calls her voice &quot; down-pillow soft, &quot; and Keya Modessa of The Situation describes her voice as “deep, sultry, and different.” [ Keya Modessa Top Albums of 2004 - Afrodisiac The Situation TheSituation.co.uk http://www.thesituation.co.uk/reviews/brandy_review.html 2010-06-30 ] While her vocal melisma s and ad-lib s have been noted for their developed sense of harmony, Norwood is most known and praised for her consistent use of multitrack recording toward her own lead and backing vocals, creating various extended chords and elaborate textures of counterpoint and polyphony, a technique that has become her signature. Terry Sawyer of Pop Matters Online comments, saying “While it&apos;s been said that Brandy&apos;s voice isn&apos;t exactly a barn burner, it&apos;s not mentioned enough that she does more than enough with what she&apos;s got. She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding it variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, shouting in the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness.” [ 2004-09-17 Terry Sawyer Album Review - Afrodisiac(2004) PopMatters PopMatter.com http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/b/brandy-afrodisiac.shtml 2010-06-30 ] [ Influence ] Norwood&apos;s vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry, most notably with contemporary R &amp; B and gospel genres. Many of Norwood’s peers laud her as a vocal inspiration and influence, including Kanye West, Chris Brown, Tank, Keyshia Cole, Keshia Chanté, John Legend, Tyrese, Ciara, Jazmine Sullivan, and Kelly Rowland among others.

In the interview she stated, “[Brandy] really helped inspire that album, I listened to [Afrodisiac] everyday [while in the studio]. [ Margeaux Watson 2007-06-21 Caribbean Queen Entertainment Weekly EW.com http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20038840_20038841_20043298%2C00.html 2010-06-30 ] Rock musician John Frusciante, former guitarist of legendary rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers praises Norwood, calling her voice “multi-dimensional” and “inspiring”. In describing her voice and signature sound he said, “You can&apos;t hear [the elaborate harmonies] with your conscious: you have to hear her voice with your subconscious.” He also mentioned that Norwood was the “main inspiration” behind the guitar work on the Red Hot Chili Pepper’s 2006 Grammy winning album, Stadium Arcadium. [ Shannon Zimmerman John Frusciante, The Empyrean Spin Magazine Spin.com http://www.spin.com/reviews/john-frusciante-empyrean-record-collection 2010-06-30 ] However, on many occasions, Norwood has been thought of as merely a talented muse, that music producers and songwriters have used to exercise their own artistic and creative energies. [ AfrodisiacAlbum Review Rolling Stone http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/6202779/review/6383758/afrodisiac 2010-06-30 ] [ Nathan S. Brandy - Human DJBooth.net http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/brandy-human-1208081/ 2010-06-30 ] This theory has been most notably linked with Norwood’s most frequent collaborator, producer Rodney Jerkins, and his own Darkchild imprint, on which many of their collaborations do not include songwriting or production from Norwood herself. Her work with Timbaland and other producer/songwriters outside of her usual circle has also often seen Norwood responsible for only vocal arrangements and delivery, rather than actual writing or producing. However, throughout her musical career, Norwood has received numerous awards and accolades for her vocal abilities, and remains one of the most influential artists of her time.
