The population was 719 at the 2010 census. Minnesota State Highways 11 and 32 are two of the main arterial routes in the community. [ History ] The word Greenbush comes from &quot; Sha Ach Wah, &quot; which means spruce tree or green bush in Ojibwe. Scandinavian, Polish and Bohemian settlers arrived in the area in 1880s, with the largest influx immigrating in the early 1890s. The Homestead Act gave [ 160 acre km2 ] free to settlers if they set up living quarters and develop a few acres into the fields. The original setting of the city was on a ridge of what used to be the shores of ancient Lake Agassiz. This village is now referred to as &quot; Old Greenbush, &quot; and is marked by Hvidso cemetery (also known as Pioneer Haven) along Highway 11. In 1904, the Great Northern railroad came to the area. It expanded north from Thief River Falls to where present day Greenbush is, where it stopped construction. Greenbush merchants moved their businesses, buildings and all, to the new town known as &quot; West Greenbush. &quot; They did this by rolling the buildings along logs, with horses tied up to posts and walking beside them. Businesses remained open during the moving days. { Greenbush, MN, 1905-2005 } A few years later, the rail line to Warroad was completed and ran directly through the old town site.
