The monument was constructed between 1840 and 1843 to a design by William Railton at a cost of £47,000.

The Craigleith sandstone statue of Nelson is by E. H. Baily and the four bronze lions on the base, added in 1867, were designed by Sir Edwin Landseer.

They depict the Battle of Cape St Vincent, the Battle of the Nile, the Battle of Copenhagen and the Death of Nelson at Trafalgar. The sculptors were Musgrave Watson, William F Woodington, John Ternouth and John Edward Carew respectively. It was refurbished in 2006 at a cost of £420,000, at which time it was surveyed and found to be 4.4 metres shorter than previously supposed.

[ Construction and history ] In February 1838 a group of 121 peers, MPs and other gentry formed a committee to raise a monument to Lord Nelson, funded by public subscription, and the Government agreed to provide a site in Trafalgar Square, in front of the newly completed National Gallery. A competition was held for designs with an estimated budget of between £20,000 and £30,000. The deadline for submissions was January 31, 1839. The winning entry, chosen by a sub-committee headed by the Duke of Wellington was a design by William Railton for a Corinthian column, surmounted by a statue of Nelson, and flanked by four sculpted lions. Flights of steps would lead up between the lionsto the pedestal of the column.

The second prize was won by Edward Hodges Baily who suggested an obelisk surrounded by sculptures. { The Civil engineer and architect&apos;s journal, Volume 2, 1839 } Criticism of the organisation of the competition caused it to be rerun. Railton submitted a slightly revised design, and was once again declared the winner, with the stipulation that the statue of Nelson should be made by EH Baily. The original plan was for a column 203 feet high, including the base and statue, but this was reduced to 170 feet, with a shaft of 98 feet, due to concerns over stability. [ Report from the Select Committee on Trafalgar Square 1840 London http://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DHXFbAAAAQAAJ%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover ] The base was to have been of granite and the shaft of Craigleith sandstone,but before construction began, it was decided that shaft should also be of granite. Excavations for the brick foundations had begun by July 1840. On 30 September 1840, the first stone of the column was laid by Charles Davison Scott, honorary secretary of the committee (and son of Nelson&apos;s secretary, John Scott), at a ceremony conducted, according to the Nautical Magazine, &quot; in a private manner, owing to the noblemen and gentlemen comprising the committee being absent from town &quot;.

In 1844 the Nelson Memorial Committee ran out of money, having only raised £20,485 in public subscriptions, { Hansards Parliamentary Debates, Vol. CXLIV, p.1220 } and the Government, in the form of the Office of Woods and Forests took over the project. Controversy over the effect that the design of the base of the column would have on views of the National Gallery led to the removal of the flights of steps. Installation of the bronze reliefs on the pedestal did not begin until late 1849, when John Edward Carew&apos;s depiction of the death of Nelson was put in place on the side facing Whitehall. This was followed early the next year by William F. Woodington &apos;s relief of the Battle of the Nile on the opposite side. [ The Nelson Column, Trafalgar Square The Times 6 December 1849 3 ] [ The Nelson Column The Times 5 April 1850 5 ] Carew&apos;s relief was cast by Adams, Christie and Co. of Rotherhithe. The other three were cast by Moore, Fressange and Moore. The last to be made, The Battle of Cape St Vincent became the subject of legal action, when it was discovered that the bronze had been adulterated with iron. The partners in the company were jailed for fraud and the relief was completed by Robinson and Cottam.

At one stage, they were intended to be of granite, and the sculptor John Graham Lough was chosen to carve them. However, in 1846, after consultations with Railton, he turned down the commission, unwilling to work under the restrictions imposed by the architect.

Their design may have been influenced by Marschalko János&apos;s lions at each abutment to the Széchenyi Lánchíd (Chain Bridge) in Budapest, installed 6 years before the Trafalgar Square lions were commissioned. Landseer was paid £6,000 for his services, and Marochetti £11,000. The column also had a symbolic importance to Adolf Hitler. If Hitler&apos;s plan to invade Britain, Operation Sea Lion, had been successful, he planned to move it to Berlin.

Steam cleaning was used together with gentle abrasives to minimise any harmful impact on the bronze and stonework. [ Project of Nelson&apos;s Column Restoration David Ball Restoration 2008-09-30 http://www.nelsons-column.co.uk/project.htm ] The £420,000 cost was covered by Zurich Financial Services, which advertised on the scaffolding for the duration of the work. Before restoration began, laser surveys were taken during which it was found that the column was significantly shorter than the usually quoted 56  m (185  ft). In fact, it measures 51.6  m (169.5  ft) from the bottom of the first step on the pedestal to the tip of the admiral&apos;s hat. [ Climbs ] John Noakes of the BBC TV children&apos;s programme Blue Peter climbed the column in the late 1970s. TV presenter and entertainer Gary Wilmot climbed the column in 1989 for LWT&apos;s &apos;Six O&apos; Clock Show&apos; to recreate the &apos;topping out&apos; ceremony of 1843. Dressed in Victorian attire and sporting a boater hat, Wilmott enjoyed tea and sandwiches at the top of the column before climbing down.Peter Germenis of the United States also climbed in 1976, reportedly on a pub wager.The column has also been climbed on several occasions as a publicity stunt to draw attention to social or political causes. Ed Drummond made the first such climb in 1979 for the Anti-Apartheid Movement, making use of the lightning conductor en route. On 13 April 1995 Simon Nadin free-climbed Nelson&apos;s Column with Noel Craine, Jerry Moffat and Johnny Dawes following on top rope, and graded the climb as &quot; E6 6b/5a &quot;. This protest time was on behalf of Survival International to publicise the plight of Canada&apos;s Inuit people. In May 2003 BASE jumper and stuntman Gary Connery parachuted from the top of the column to draw attention to the Chinese policies in Tibet. [ Other monuments to Nelson ] [ Monuments and memorials to Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson ] The first civic monument to be erected in Nelson&apos;s honour was a 44-metre high obelisk on Glasgow Green in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1806. Also in Scotland, the Nelson Monument stands on top of Calton Hill, Edinburgh, and there is also a Nelson&apos;s Tower in Forres, Moray. In Dublin, Ireland, Nelson&apos;s Pillar was erected in 1808 but was destroyed by the IRA in 1966, and in the Bull Ring, Birmingham, England, there is a Grade II* listed bronze statue of Nelson by Richard Westmacott, dating from 1809. Sir Richard Westmacott also designed the elaborate monument to Nelson in Liverpool. In Portsmouth, Nelson&apos;s Needle, on top of Portsdown Hill, was paid for by the company of [ Victory ] after arriving back in Portsmouth. There is a column topped with a decorative urn in the Castle Green, Hereford – a statue was planned in place of the urn, but insufficient money was raised.
