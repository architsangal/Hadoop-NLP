On 20 February 2006, after the conclusion of the twelve-podcast series, it was announced that all future episodes would be available from Audible.com at a &quot; nominal fee &quot; (later, these had to be called audiobooks in accordance with iTunes policy). Two more series—-each with six podcasts—-were released between February and September 2006. In late 2006 three more free podcasts were released.

[ Television ] Gervais has contributed to the BAFTA -winning The Sketch Show (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV debut came in September 1998 as part of Channel 4 &apos;s &quot; Comedy Lab &quot; series of pilots. His one-off show Golden Years focused on a David Bowie –obsessed character called Clive Meadows. Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced Ali G &apos;s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme The 11 O&apos;Clock Show in early 1999, in which his character used as many expletive s as was possible and produced an inordinate amount of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was Mackenzie Crook, later a co-star of The Office. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called Meet Ricky Gervais; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself. The Independent newspaper has described Gervais as &quot; obsessed by his own celebrity &quot;, but adds, &quot; Who wouldn&apos;t want to be Peter Lawford in a comedy Rat Pack ? &quot; in reference to Ricky Gervais Meets...; the article, however, also describes him as &quot; a very funny man &quot; who &quot; created one of the great sitcoms &quot;.

Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show Bruiser and The Jim Tavare Show, and he had a cameo role in Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes &apos;s sitcom, Spaced, as Dave. Pegg later joked that Dave was a younger David Brent and that he and Hynes were the real minds behind The Office. Gervais also appeared in a few of Channel 4&apos;s &apos;Top 100...&apos; list programmes, and he voiced the character of Penguin in Robbie the Reindeer &apos;s Legend of the Lost Tribe. His voice was redubbed for the US market. On 5 January 2006 he interviewed Larry David in a one-off special, Ricky Gervais Meets... Larry David. On 25 and 26 December of the same year Channel 4 aired similar specials in which he interviewed the actor/comedian Christopher Guest and comedian Garry Shandling. There are no plans for further episodes of Meets..., although editions with John Cleese and Matt Groening were recorded in 2006 for broadcast in 2007.

He is the only British comic to write and star in a Simpsons episode. The episode was the highest rated in Sky One&apos;s history, arguably because of its extensive promotion, which revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode&apos;s sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified the extent of his input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for Dazed and Confused magazine (January 2006): &quot; No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a Simpsons script. I&apos;m going to get the credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort &quot;. Asked in a separate interview about how his idea for the episode (in which Homer swaps Marge on a game show) came about, Gervais replied: I&apos;ve always been fascinated with reality game show s but I think it was my girlfriend&apos;s idea.

He has said about the appearance, &quot; I did an episode of Alias, and I can&apos;t watch it. Me being serious. I can&apos;t watch it &quot;. Gervais made a cameo appearance on Saturday Night Live in a Digital Short during which he claims that The Office was adapted from a Japanese programme of the same name (with Steve Carell reprising his role as Michael Scott).
