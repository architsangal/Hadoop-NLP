He has resided in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan since 2003, and has { 蔵出しここだけクロニクル ｜ マーティ・フリードマン } hosted his own television programs, Rock Fujiyama and Jukebox English on Japanese television. [ Early career (1982–1989) ] Friedman is a largely self-taught guitarist [ http://www.martyfriedman.com/fans_faq_content.php?id%3D5049 Marty Friedman official website Martyfriedman.com 2012-03-08 ] known for his improvisation and for fusing Eastern musical with Western music other styles, such as neo-classical, thrash metal and later progressive rock. When playing, Friedman often uses arpeggiated chord s and various customized scales. He also occasionally uses sweep picking. He has a very unorthodox right hand picking technique, namely the angle in which his hand is clenched goes against the conventional palm mute. He also frequently uses the upstroke as opposed to the down stroke, especially on the high strings (strings B and E). These qualities make Friedman&apos;s solos unique and hard to duplicate using an alternate picking approach. During his early years as a musician, he formed and played lead guitar in several bands, including Deuce, Hawaii (which had previously been called Vixen), and notably Cacophony. Cacophony featured neoclassical metal elements and synchronized twin guitar harmonies and counterpoint s shared with guitarist Jason Becker. He played guitar on the 1987 album &quot; It Won&apos;t Be Long &quot; by Christian rock band Shout. [ http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/shout.htm No Life &apos;til Metal - CD Gallery - Shout Nolifetilmetal.com 2012-03-08 ] In 1988, he recorded demos for Jet Red that eventually were released as bonus tracks on the 2009 Jet Red release &quot; Flight Plan &quot;. [ Megadeth (1990–2000) ] When Cacophony broke up in 1989, Friedman auditioned for the thrash metal band Megadeth after a tip from fellow guitarist Jeff Loomis. Friedman was initially rejected by Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine for having multicolored hair. However, after undergoing what Mustaine called &quot; Rock School 101 &quot;, Friedman officially joined Megadeth in February 1990. { Megadeth.com, Megadeth.com - History at Megadeth.com; last accessed December 29, 2007. } Friedman&apos;s audition can be seen as an Easter egg on the Megadeth DVD Arsenal of Megadeth. The first album he recorded with them was Rust in Peace, now considered a classic thrash metal album, and sold platinum in the US. [ February 2007 ] He further developed his style of playing exotic scale solos from the Cacophony era, and integrated it into the music of Megadeth. In July 1992, Megadeth released Countdown to Extinction, which was a more commercial album, aimed at a wider audience, and sold double platinum. [ February 2007 ] Friedman played on Megadeth&apos;s further releases Youthanasia (1994), Cryptic Writings (1997), Risk (1999). After a total of five studio album s with Megadeth, in December 1999 Friedman announced his departure from Megadeth. His last show with them was on January 14, 2000. Later, he stated that he got tired of playing metal music and felt that he couldn&apos;t develop as a musician. [ February 2007 ] In an interview with Ultimate-Guitar.com in March 2007, he claimed that Megadeth was not aggressive enough. { Ultimate-Guitar.com, Marty Friedman: &apos;I Didn&apos;t Think Megadeth Were Aggressive Enough!&apos; at ultimate-guitar.com; last accessed May 5, 2007. } During Friedman&apos;s time in the band, they sold over ten million albums worldwide. { Martyfriedman.com, Biography of Marty Friedman at Martyfriedman.com; last accessed May 5, 2007. } [ Solo career and collaborations (2001–present) ] [ section June 2009 ] Friedman appeared on the track &quot; Born of Anger &quot; on the album All That Remains by Fozzy. Friedman is a big fan of The Ramones (to whom he briefly paid tribute in the Arizona based cover band Rocket to Russia [ http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode%3DArticle%26amp%3BnewsitemID%3D73151 MARTY FRIEDMAN: Video Footage Of 2002 Ramones Tribute Gig Available Roadrunnerrecords.com 2012-03-08 ] ), Black Sabbath, Kiss and Queen (during their early years). He also included the track &apos;Peace&apos; from the fifth Weezer studio album Make Believe on a list of his &apos;most listened to&apos; songs on his official website. He has also appeared on Where Moth and Rust Destroy, the latest album of the Christian thrash metal band Tourniquet where he performed all guitar solos except two (which were performed by Bruce Franklin ). He has also appeared as a guest on the Firewind album Forged by Fire. In 2004 Friedman joined psychedelic trance musician Takeomi Matsuura (known by the alias Zeta ) as a guitarist. Their full-length debut album was released January 4, 2007, also titled Zeta, and included remix es by psychedelic trance musicians such as Astrix. In 2005, Friedman appeared on the soundtrack of the video game Heavy Metal Thunder adapted from the Hebimeta-san TV show. Friedman&apos;s album, Loudspeaker, was released in Japan on June 26, 2006. It entered the Japanese national chart at #33. This marks the first Top 40 chart position for any of his solo albums. Friedman&apos;s &quot; Exhibit A-Live in Europe &quot; CD and &quot; Exhibit B-Live &quot; in Tokyo DVD were released simultaneously in Japan on 8/22 by Avex. The CD and DVD feature different set lists, but with the same band members, Jeremy Colson ( Steve Vai, ex-Dali&apos;s Dilemma), Ron Jarzombek ( Blotted Science, Watchtower, Spastic Ink ) and Chris Catero (Razer, ex-Wardog).The artwork was designed by legendary graphic artist Noritaka Sakai, who is responsible for Queen&apos;s most successful Japanese editions. Friedman was interview in the 2008 documentary film Global Metal, in which he showed his perspectives on heavy metal in Japan.. Friedman has collaborated with Mutsuhiko Izumi, a video game composer known for his contributions to Konami &apos;s Guitar Freaks &amp; DrumMania series to produce &quot; Model DD8 &quot;, and &quot; Liverty &quot;, two songs featured on Izumi&apos;s album Heaven Inside.

He also launched a record label under Avex Group, Gokukara Records. [ http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode%3DArticle%26amp%3BnewsitemID%3D147884 MARTY FRIEDMAN Launches Record Label BlabberMouth ] Shortly after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Friedman began auctioning off a great variety of his musical equipment and paraphernalia that he used as a member of Megadeth. A message attached to each Ebay item stated that all proceeds would go to the GlobalGiving foundation, in an effort to help those whose livelihood had been wiped out by the disaster. [ Equipment ] [ June 2009 ] Friedman has played a variety of guitars throughout his career. In his days with Cacophony, Friedman played Hurricane guitars, then Carvin guitars, primarily a V220M model. He also used Hurricane and Carvin on his first solo recording, Dragon&apos;s Kiss. When Marty joined Megadeth in 1989, he switched over from Carvin to Jackson Guitars. Primarily, he was responsible for popularizing the now highly acclaimed Jackson Kelly guitar, a sleeker and faster version of the Gibson Explorer Z style shape. The first line of KE1s, which were his signature models, had poplar bodies with maple neck through construction and a single Seymour Duncan JB pickup as well as a Kahler Fine-tuning fixed bridge. Later versions of the KE1 would have a Floyd Rose double locking tremolo in place of the Kahler. He also used other Jacksons, such as the Rhoads and the Roswell Rhoads. He has since sold all of his Megadeth-era Jackson guitars on eBay to raise funds after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Marty used Gibson and Fender guitars on the Risk tours as well. He used Jackson guitars up until 2000, when he started endorsing Ibanez guitars. He had produced a signature model with Ibanez (based on the Ibanez SZ line of guitars) called the MFM, but this model was available in Japan and not in the US. He has since left Ibanez and started using various other guitar models, most notably PRS Guitars which he is an endorser of, using their Singlecut and Tremonti signature models. He can also be seen using various Gibson Les Pauls and custom-built instruments. It is hotly contested what amplifiers Marty first used with Megadeth on their landmark album &quot; Rust in Peace. &quot; He almost definitely used a Bogner Triple Giant and a Tube Works solid-state preamp for solos, along with a VHT 2150 power amp. Contrary to popular belief the Bogner Fish, which is often cited as the preamp for the album, was first released one year after the album debuted, therefore making it impossible to be the preamp of use on this album, unless he received a pre-production model. Marty and Dave Mustaine both used Custom Audio Electronics 3+ Preamps and VHT 2150 power amps on the commercially successful &quot; Countdown to Extinction &quot; and &quot; Youthanasia &quot; albums. When recording started on &quot; Cryptic Writings, Marty switched to Crate Amplifiers. He used these on all of his recordings after Youthanasia, primarily using Crate&apos;s highly successful Blue Voodoo tube amplifiers. As of 2007 however, Crate has discontinued the Blue Voodoo and Marty now uses ENGL amplifiers. He uses Special Edition heads and Vintage cabinets from ENGL.
