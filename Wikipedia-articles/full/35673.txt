[ February 2011 ] [ 195 ] [ 195 ] { NOTOC } Year 195 ( CXCV ) was a common year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Scrapula and Clemens (or, less frequently, year 948 Ab urbe condita ). The denomination 195 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. [ Events ] [ By place ] [ Roman Empire ] Emperor Septimius Severus has the Senate deify Commodus in an attempt to gain favor with the family of Marcus Aurelius. King Vologases V and other eastern princes support the claims of Pescennius Niger. The province of Mesopotamia rises in revolt with Parthian support. Severus travels to Mesopotamia to battle the Parthians. The province of Syria is divided and the role of Antioch is diminished. The Romans annexed the Syrian city&apos;s Edessa and Nisibis (modern Turkey ). Severus re-establishes his headquarters and colonies there. Lucius Septimius Bassianus (Caracalla), age 7, changed his name to Marcus Aurelius Antoninus to solidify connections with the family of Marcus Aurelius and is given the title Caesar. Clodius Albinus, who had been proclaimed emperor in Britain, crosses into Gaul with his legions, while at the same time recruiting new soldiers. He is soon the head of an army of 150,000 men. Severus, still in Mesopotamia, hastily returns to Rome. The denarius is devalued by Severus. The coin now contains only 50% precious metal.
