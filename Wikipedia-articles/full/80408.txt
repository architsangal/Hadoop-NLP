Gang members are typically &quot; jumped in &quot; or have to prove their loyalty by committing acts such as theft, violence or even murder. Gangs are prominent in the larger cities in the United States, in prisons and jails while many branches of the original gang are present in small towns and suburbs. American gangs originated in the city of Chicago and the surrounding areas. These gangs were competing with one another during the prohibition era and would often beat or even murder an opposing gang member for attempting to sell or distribute illegal liquor on their &quot; turf &quot;. This resulted in retaliation and eventually a &quot; war &quot; between the opposing gangs. { Taylor, Terrance, J. &quot; Gangs, Peers, and Co-Offending &quot;.

In early usage, the word gang referred to a group of workmen. In the United Kingdom the word is still often used in this sense, but it later underwent pejoration. The word gang often carries a negative connotation; however, within a gang which defines itself in opposition to mainstream norms, members may adopt the phrase as a statement of identity or defiance. The word gang derives from the past participle of Old English gan, meaning &quot; to go &quot;.

Miller (1992) defines a street gang as “a self-formed association of peers, united by mutual interests, with identifiable leadership and internal organization, who act collectively or as individuals to achieve specific purposes, including the conduct of illegal activity and control of a particular territory, facility, or enterprise. &quot; { Miller, W.B. 1992 (Revised from 1982).

Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, Office of JusticePrograms, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. } Understanding the structure of gangs is a critical skill to defining the types of strategies that are most effective with dealing with them, from the at-risk youth to the gang leaders. [ http://www.lawtechcustompublishing.com/publication.asp?pid%3D47 gang Gangs: Theory, Practice and Research Matthew O&apos;Deane ] Not all individuals who display the outward signs of gang membership are actually involved in criminal activities. An individual&apos;s age, physical structure, ability to fight, willingness to use violence, and arrest record are often principal factors in determining where an individual stands in the gang hierarchy; now money derived from criminal activity and ability to provide for the gang also impacts the individual’s status within the gang. The structure of gangs varies depending primarily on size which can range in size from five or ten to several thousand. Many of the larger gangs break up into smaller groups, cliques or sub-sets. The cliques typically bring more territory to a gang as they expand and recruit new members. Most gangs operate informally with leadership falling to whoever takes control; others have distinct leadership and are highly structured, much like a business or corporation. Matthew O’Deane, Ph.D., has identified five primary steps of gang involvement applicable to the majority of gangs in the world; at risk, associates, members, hardcore members and leaders. [ &quot; At Risk” or &quot; Peripheral &quot; ] This group of kids is not considered gang members by law enforcement, but they know gang members and may associate with them on a casual or limited basis, mostly watching and imitating the older gang members. They are getting close to an age where they might decide to join the gang. They may like and admire the gang members in the neighborhood and the gang lifestyle, but do not participate in the gang’s criminal activity. This group is generally between 7 and 9 years old. [ “Associates” or “Affiliates” ] These kids associate with gang members on a regular basis and tend to consider gang life normal and acceptable. They find certain things in common with gang members and are seriously thinking about joining the gang. Some associates consider themselves members, even if they have not yet been formally initiated. This person is commonly called a “Wanna Be”, “Pee Wee”, or “Baby Gangster”; many may claim to back up the gang if confronted by law enforcement. They may act, walk, talk, and dress like gang members and will tend to socialize with them. These associates are sometimes used by older gang members to do specific tasks, such as serving as lookouts, runners, or for writing graffiti. This group typically lacks direction and may drift in and out of the gang depending on the current activities of the gang. This person is generally between the ages of 9 and 13, but can range from 7 to 18 years old in some cases. It is often difficult to distinguish an associate from a member by looking at them. The difference is in their commitment to the gang. Young gang recruits [ “Gang Member” ] This person associates almost exclusively with other gang members to the exclusion of family and former friends. They have shifted their loyalty from their family to their gang. This person participates in gang crimes and most of the gang’s activities. They make up the bulk of a gang’s membership and are held responsible for protection of the gangs turf and fellow gang members. This person is generally between the ages of 14 and 20 years old, but can range from 11 to 40 years old in some cases. The gang member has a much more significant attachment to the gang mentality or code when compared to an associate. Nowadays there are also &quot; wannabes &quot; who are usually young children who want to be in a gang and act like gang members at young ages, this has an effect on the community when these children commit crimes: Shoplifting, Fights Etc. [ “Hard Core Gang Member” ] This gang member has become totally committed to the gang and gang lifestyle, commonly referred to as an “OG” or Original Gangster or “Veterano”. This usage has changed from its original meaning, which indicated a founding member of a gang or one who was active in the 1960s or 1970s. They usually reject any value system other than that of his/her gang and their life revolves around the gang. This member typically has been arrested and been through the justice system. This person will commit any crime or act of violence to further the goals and objectives of the gang. This person is usually in his/her late teens or early 20’s extending into their 30’s in some cases. [ “Gang Leader” ] { Black Mafia Family leaders in 2004 } These members are the upper echelons of the gang’s command. This gang member is probably the oldest in the possy and likely has the smallest criminal record and they often have the power to direct the gang’s activity, whether they are involved or not. In many jurisdictions, this person is likely a prison gang member calling the shots from within the prison system or is on parole. Often, they distance themselves from the street gang activities and make attempts to appear legitimate, possibly operating a business that they run as fronts for the gang’s drug dealing or other illegal operations. [ http://www.paladin-press.com/product/Gang_Investigators_Handbook/Gangs gang Gang Investigators Handbook Matthew O&apos;Deane ] Prison gangs are groups in a prison or correctional institution [ http://www.prisoncommission.org/statements/fleisher_mark_s.pdf Societal and Correctional Context of Prison Gangs source 2009 ] for mutual protection and advancement. Prison gangs often have several &quot; affiliates &quot; or &quot; chapters &quot; in different state prison systems that branch out due to the movement or transfer of their members. The 2005 study neither War nor Peace: International Comparisons of Children and Youth in Organized Armed Violence studied ten cities worldwide and found that in eight of them, &quot; street gangs had strong links to prison gangs &quot;. According to criminal justice professor John Hagedorn, many of the biggest gangs from Chicago originated from prisons. From the St. Charles Illinois Youth Center originated the Conservative Vice Lords and Blackstone Rangers. Although the majority of gang leaders from Chicago are now incarcerated, most of those leaders continue to manage their gangs from within prison. [ Hagedorn 2008 12 ] Criminal gangs may function both inside and outside of school, such as the Nuestra Familia, Mexican Mafia, Folk Nation, and the Brazilian PCC. During the 1970s, prison gangs in Cape Town, South Africa began recruiting street gang members from outside and helped increase associations between prison and street gangs. [ Hagedorn 2008 13 ] In the USA, prison gang Aryan Brotherhood is in organized crime outside prison. [ Who Joins and Why ] The numerous push factors experienced by at-risk individuals vary situationally however follow a common theme for the desire of power, respect, money and protection. These factors are very influential in the luring process and largely contribute to the reasons why individuals join gangs. These factors are particularly more attractive and influential on at-risk youth. Many times individuals are experiencing low levels of these various factors in their own lives, and feel that joining a gang is the only way to obtain status and success. Unfortunately, a common sentiment is &quot; if you can&apos;t beat &apos;em, join &apos;em &quot;. These at-risk individuals feel ostracized from the community and are experiencing a lack of social support. Upon joining a gang, they instantly gain a feeling of belonging and identity; they are surrounded with individuals whom they can relate to. They have generally grown up in the same area as each other and can bond over similar needs. In some areas, joining a gang is an integrated part of the growing up process. { O&apos;Grady. 2007.

[ Hagedorn 2008 14 ] Brazilian urbanization has driven the drug trade to the favela s of Rio. Often, gangs hire &quot; lookouts &quot; to warn members of upcoming law enforcement. The dense environments of favelas in Rio and public housing projects in Chicago have helped gang members hide from police easily. [ Hagedorn 2008 14–15 ] Street gangs take over territory or &quot; turf &quot; in a particular city and are often involved in &quot; providing protection &quot;, often a thin cover for extortion, as the &quot; protection &quot; is usually from the gang itself, or in other criminal activity.

[ Hagedorn 2008 7 ] Social disorganization, the disintegration of societal institutions such as family, school, and the public safety net enable groups of peers to form gangs. [ Hagedorn 2008 6 ] According to surveys conducted internationally by the World Bank for their World Development Report 2011, by far the most common reason people suggest as a motive for joining gangs is unemployment. { 2011 World Development Report See Figure F2.2 on page 35 } Ethnic solidarity is a common factor in gangs. Black and Hispanic gangs formed during the 1960s in the USA often adapted nationalist rhetoric. [ Hagedorn 2008 16 ] Both majority and minority races in society have established gangs in the name of identity: the Igbo gang Bakassi Boys in Nigeria defend the majority Igbo group violently and through terror, and in the United States, whites who feel threatened by minority rights have formed their own groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan. Responding to an increasing black and Hispanic migration, a white gang called Gaylords formed in Chicago.

Gangs are using the Internet to communicate with each other, facilitate criminal activity, spread their message and culture around the nation. As Internet pages like MySpace, YouTube, Twitter, AIM, and Facebook become more popular, law enforcement works to understand how to conduct investigations related to gang activity in an online environment. In most cases the police can and will get the information they need, however this requires police officers and federal agents to make formal legal requests for information in a timely manner, which typically requires a search warrant or subpoena to compel the service providers to supply the needed information. A grand jury subpoena or administrative subpoena, court order, search warrant; or user consent is needed to get this information pursuant to the Electronic Communication Privacy Act, Title 18 U.S.C. § 2701, et seq. (ECPA). Just about every gang member has personal web page or some type of social networking internet account or chat room where they post photos and videos and talk openly about their gang exploits. The majority of the service providers that gang members use are free social networking sites that allow users to create their own profile pages, which can include lists of their favorite musicians, books and movies, photos of themselves and friends, and links to related web pages. Many of these services also permit users to send and receive private messages and talk in private chat rooms. Many times a police officer may stumble upon one of these pages, or an informant can get you into the local gang page, providing you a name and password to use to get in and explore, other times you do not have that option and will have to formally request the needed information. Most service providers have four basic types of information about its users that may be relevant to a criminal investigation; 1) basic identity/subscriber information supplied by the user in creating the account; 2) IP log-in information; 3) files stored in a user’s profile (such as “about me” information or lists of friends); and 4) user sent and received message content. It is important to know the law, and understand what exactly we can get service providers to do and what their capabilities are. It is also important to understand how gang members use the Internet and how we as the police can use their desire to be recognized and respected in their sub-culture against them.
