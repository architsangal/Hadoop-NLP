The living Gnetophyta consists of around 70 species across the three genera Gnetum ( family Gnetaceae), Welwitschia (family Welwitschiaceae), and Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). The gnetophytes differ from other gymnosperms (i.e. conifer s, cycad s, and ginkgo s ) in having vessel element s (which transport water within the plant) as found in flowering plant s. The gnetophytes evolutionary relationships remain unclear: in some classifications, all three genera are placed in a single order (Gnetales), while in other classifications they are distributed among three orders, each containing a single family and genus. Most morphological and molecular studies confirm that Gnetum and Welwitschia diverged from each other more recently than from Ephedra.

However, the most well-known member of this group, Gnetum gnemon, is a tree. Its seeds are used to produce a crispy krupuk snack known as emping or krupuk belinjo.

This strange species has only two large strap-like leaves that grow continuously from the base throughout the plant&apos;s life. Plants of the genus Ephedra are known as jointfirs because they have long slender branches which bear tiny scale-like leaves at their nodes. Ephedra has been traditionally used as a stimulant, but is a controlled substance today in many jurisdictions because of the risk of harmful or even fatal overdosing. Knowledge of fossils of the gnetophytes has increased greatly since the 1980s. There are fossils from the Permian, [ http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/94/2/281 A New Permian Gnetalean Cone as Fossil Evidence for Supporting Current Molecular Phylogeny Zi-Qiang Wang Annals of Botany 2004 94 2 281–288 10.1093/aob/mch138 15229124 ] the Triassic, and the Jurassic which may belong to the gnetophytes, but this is uncertain.

Crane and Else Marie Friis 16675607 2803531 ] The fossil record is richer starting in the early Cretaceous, with fossils of plants as well as seed s and pollen which can be clearly assigned to the gnetophytes. [ Classification ] The evolutionary relationships among the seed plants are highly unresolved, and the gnetophytes have played an important role in the formation of phylogenetic hypotheses. Molecular phylogenies of extant gymnosperms have conflicted with morphological characters with regard to whether the gymnosperms as a whole (including gnetophytes) comprise a monophyletic group or a paraphyletic one that gave rise to angiosperms. At issue is whether the Gnetophyta are the sister group of angiosperms, or whether they are sister to, or nested within, other extant gymnosperms. Numerous fossil gymnosperm clades once existed that are morphologically at least as distinctive as the four living gymnosperm groups, such as Bennettitales, Caytonia and the glossopterids. When these gymnosperm fossils are considered, the question of gnetophyte relationships to other seed plants becomes even more complicated. Several hypotheses, illustrated below, have been presented to explain seed plant evolution. Recent research by Lee EK, Cibrian-Jaramillo A, et al. (2011) suggests that the Gnetephyta are a sister group to the rest of the gymnosperms, [ Lee EK, Cibrian-Jaramillo A, Kolokotronis S-O, Katari MS, Stamatakis A et al. 2011 A Functional Phylogenomic View of the Seed Plants PLoS Genet 7 12 e1002411 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002411 ] supporting the anthophyte hypothesis. [ Anthophyte hypothesis ] From the early twentieth century, the anthophyte hypothesis was the prevailing explanation for seed plant evolution, based on shared morphological characters between the gnetophytes and angiosperm s. In this hypothesis, the gnetophytes, along with the extinct order Bennettitales, are sister to the angiosperms, forming the &quot; anthophytes &quot;. Some morphological characters that were suggested to unite the anthophytes include vessels in wood, net-veined leaves (in Gnetum only), lignin chemistry, the layering of cells in the apical meristem, pollen and megaspore features (including thin megaspore wall), short cambial initials, and lignin syringal groups.

These shared traits include: tracheids with scalariform pits with tori interspersed with annular thickenings, absence of scalariform pitting in primary xylem, scale-like and strap-shaped leaves of Ephedra and Welwitschia; and reduced sporophyll s.

According to this hypothesis, the conifers as currently defined are not a monophyletic group, in contrast with molecular findings that support its monophyly. All existing evidence for this hypothesis comes from molecular studies within the last decade. However, the morphological evidence remains difficult to reconcile with the gnepine hypothesis. If the gnetophytes are nested within conifers, they must have lost several shared derived characters of the conifers (or these characters must have evolved in parallel in the other conifer lineages): narrowly triangular leaves (gnetophytes have diverse leaf shapes), resin canals, a tiered proembryo, and flat woody ovuliferous cone scales. These kinds of major morphological changes are not without precedent in the Pinaceae, however: the Taxaceae, for example, have lost the classical cone of the conifers in favor of a single-terminal ovule surrounded by a fleshy aril.
