[ McLuhan 1962 ] {; } [ Eisenstein 1980 ] {; } [ Febvre Martin 1997 ] {; } [ Man 2002 ] Gutenberg was the first European to use movable type printing, in around 1439. Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based ink; and the use of a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw press es of the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system which allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg&apos;s method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a type metal alloy and a hand mould for casting type. The use of movable type was a marked improvement on the handwritten manuscript, which was the existing method of book production in Europe, and upon woodblock printing, and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg&apos;s printing technology spread rapidly throughout Europe and later the world. His major work, the Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality. [ Early life ] Gutenberg in a 16th century copper engraving Gutenberg was born in the German city of Mainz, the youngest son of the upper-class merchant Friele Gensfleisch zur Laden, and his second wife Else Wyrich, who was the daughter of a shopkeeper. According to some accounts Friele was a goldsmith for the bishop at Mainz, but most likely, he was involved in the cloth trade. [ http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/english/zeitgum.htm Gutenberg and Mainz Hanebutt-Benz, Eva-Maria 2006-11-24 ] Gutenberg&apos;s year of birth is not precisely known but was most likely around 1398. John Lienhard, technology historian, says &quot; Most of Gutenberg&apos;s early life is a mystery. His father worked with the ecclesiastic mint. Gutenberg grew up knowing the trade of goldsmithing. &quot; { Lienhard, John H } This is supported by historian Heinrich Wallau, who adds, &quot; In the 14th and 15th centuries his [descendants] claimed a hereditary position as...the master of the archiepiscopal mint. In this capacity they doubtless acquired considerable knowledge and technical skill in metal working. They supplied the mint with the metal to be coined, changed the various species of coins, and had a seat at the assizes in forgery cases. &quot; { Wallau, Heinrich. Johann Gutenberg. The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. } Wallau adds, &quot; His surname was derived from the house inhabited by his father and his paternal ancestors &apos;zu Laden, zu Gutenberg&apos;. The house of Gänsfleisch was one of the patrician families of the town, tracing its lineage back to the thirteenth century. &quot; Patricians (aristocrats) in Mainz were often named after houses they owned. Around 1427, the name zu Gutenberg, after the family house in Mainz, is documented to have been used for the first time. In 1411, there was an uprising in Mainz against the patricians, and more than a hundred families were forced to leave. As a result, the Gutenbergs are thought to have moved to Eltville am Rhein (Alta Villa), where his mother had an inherited estate. According to historian Heinrich Wallau, &quot; All that is known of his youth is that he was not in Mainz in 1430. It is presumed that he migrated for political reasons to Strassburg (Strasbourg), where the family probably had connections. &quot; He is assumed to have studied at the University of Erfurt, where there is a record of the enrolment of a student called Johannes de Altavilla in 1418—Altavilla is the Latin form of Eltville am Rhein.

He also appears to have been a goldsmith member enrolled in the Strasbourg militia. In 1437, there is evidence that he was instructing a wealthy tradesman on polishing gems, but where he had acquired this knowledge is unknown. In 1436/37 his name also comes up in court in connection with a broken promise of marriage to a woman from Strasbourg, Ennelin. [ Gutenberg und seine Zeit in Daten (Gutenberg and his times; Timeline) http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/zeitgutb.htm Gutenberg Museum 2006-11-24 ] Whether the marriage actually took place is not recorded. Following his father&apos;s death in 1419, he is mentioned in the inheritance proceedings.

Such presses could produce up to 240 impressions per hour. Wolf 1974 67f. { Featherbed Alley Printshop Museum, in } { Bermuda. } Around 1439, Gutenberg was involved in a financial misadventure making polished metal mirrors (which were believed to capture holy light from religious relics) for sale to pilgrims to Aachen : in 1439 the city was planning to exhibit its collection of relics from Emperor Charlemagne but the event was delayed by one year due to a severe flood and the capital already spent could not be repaid. When the question of satisfying the investors came up, Gutenberg is said to have promised to share a &quot; secret &quot;. It has been widely speculated that this secret may have been the idea of printing with movable type. [ Burke James James Burke (science historian) Connections Macmillan Publishers 1978 London 101 0-333-24827-9 ] Legend has it that the idea came to him &quot; like a ray of light &quot;. [ Burke, James The Day the Universe Changed Little, Brown and Company 1985 Boston, Toronto 0-316-11695-5 ] Until at least 1444 he lived in Strasbourg, most likely in the St. Arbogast parish. It was in Strasbourg in 1440 that Gutenberg is said to have perfected and unveiled the secret of printing based on his research, mysteriously entitled Kunst und Aventur (art and enterprise). It is not clear what work he was engaged in, or whether some early trials with printing from movable type may have been conducted there. After this, there is a gap of four years in the record. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law Arnold Gelthus, quite possibly for a printing press or related paraphernalia. By this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with intaglio printing; it is claimed that he had worked on copper engraving s with an artist known as the Master of Playing Cards. [ Lehmann-Haupt, Hellmut Gutenberg and the Master of the Playing Cards New Haven Yale University Press 1966 ] By 1450, the press was in operation, and a German poem had been printed, possibly the first item to be printed there. [ Klooster John W. Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates 2009 ABC-CLIO Santa Barbara, CA 978-0-313-34745-0 8 ] Gutenberg was able to convince the wealthy moneylender Johann Fust for a loan of 8000 guilder s. Peter Schöffer, who became Fust&apos;s son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Schöffer had worked as a scribe in Paris and is believed to have designed some of the first typeface s. Gutenberg&apos;s workshop was set up at Hof Humbrecht, a property belonging to a distant relative. It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452. At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is also some speculation that there may have been two presses, one for the pedestrian texts, and one for the Bible. One of the profit-making enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of indulgence s for the church, documented from 1454–55. [ December 2011 ] In 1455 Gutenberg completed his 42-line Bible, known as the Gutenberg Bible. About 180 copies were printed, most on paper and some on vellum. [ Court case ] Some time in 1456, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, and Fust demanded his money back, accusing Gutenberg of misusing the funds. Meanwhile the expenses of the Bible project had proliferated, and Gutenberg&apos;s debt now exceeded 20,000 guilders. Fust sued at the archbishop&apos;s court. A November 1455 legal document records that there was a partnership for a &quot; project of the books, &quot; the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust. The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of all printed Bibles. Thus Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it appears he retained (or re-started) a small printing shop, and participated in the printing of a Bible in the town of Bamberg around 1459, for which he seems at least to have supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain, and there is consequently a considerable scholarly debate on this subject. It is also possible that the large Catholicon dictionary, 300 copies of 754 pages, printed in Mainz in 1460, may have been executed in his workshop. Meanwhile, the Fust–Schöffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer&apos;s name and date, the Mainz Psalter of August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg. [ Later life ] In 1462, during a conflict between two archbishops, Mainz was sacked by archbishop Adolph von Nassau, and Gutenberg was exiled. An old man by now, he moved to Eltville where he may have initiated and supervised a new printing press belonging to the brothers Bechtermünze. [ December 2011 ] In January 1465, Gutenberg&apos;s achievements were recognized and he was given the title Hofmann (gentleman of the court) by von Nassau. This honor included a stipend, an annual court outfit, as well as 2,180 litres of grain and 2,000 litres of wine tax-free. It is believed he may have moved back to Mainz around this time, but this is not certain. [ December 2011 ] Gutenberg died in 1468 and was buried in the Franciscan church at Mainz, his contributions largely unknown. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg&apos;s grave is now lost. In 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of typography in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon&apos;s biography of famous Germans. [ December 2011 ] [ Printed books ] [ Gutenberg Bible ] { Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. } Between 1450 and 1455, Gutenberg printed several texts, some of which remain unidentified; his texts did not bear the printer&apos;s name or date, so attribution is possible only from typographical evidence and external references. Certainly several church documents including a papal letter and two indulgences were printed, one of which was issued in Mainz. Realizing the value of printing in quantity, seven editions in two styles were ordered, resulting in several thousand copies being printed. { Meggs, Philip B., Purvis, Alston W.History of Graphic Design. Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2006. p.71. } Some printed editions of Ars Minor, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by Aelius Donatus may have been printed by Gutenberg; these have been dated either 1451–52 or 1455. In 1455, Gutenberg completed copies of a beautifully executed folio Bible (Biblia Sacra), with 42 lines on each page. Copies sold for 30 florins each, [ Cormack, Lesley B.; Ede, Andrew A History of Science in Society: From Philosophy to Utility Broadview Press 2004 1-55111-332-5 ] which was roughly three years&apos; wages for an average clerk. Nonetheless, it was significantly cheaper than a manuscript Bible that could take a single scribe over a year to prepare. After printing the text, some copies were rubricated or hand-illuminated in the same elegant way as manuscript Bibles from the same period. 48 substantially complete copies are known to survive, including two at the British Library that can be viewed and compared online. [ http://prodigi.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/search.asp Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible 2006-10-19 British Library ] The text lacks modern features such as pagination, indentations, and paragraph break s. An undated 36-line edition of the Bible was printed, probably in Bamberg in 1458-1460, possibly by Gutenberg. A large part of it was shown to have been set from a copy of Gutenberg&apos;s Bible, thus disproving earlier speculation that it may have been the earlier of the two. [ Kapr Albert Johannes Gutenberg: the Man and His Invention Scolar Press 1996 322 1-85928-114-1 ] [ Printing method with movable type ] Movable metal type, and composing stick, descended from Gutenberg&apos;s press. Gutenberg&apos;s early printing process, and what tests he may have made with movable type, are not known in great detail. His later Bibles were printed in such a way as to have required large quantities of type, some estimates suggesting as many as 100,000 individual sorts. [ Singer, C.; Holmyard, E.; Hall, A.; Williams, T. A History of Technology, vol.3 Oxford University Press 1958 ] Setting each page would take, perhaps, half a day, and considering all the work in loading the press, inking the type, pulling the impressions, hanging up the sheets, distributing the type, etc., it is thought that the Gutenberg–Fust shop might have employed as many as 25 craftsmen. Gutenberg&apos;s technique of making movable type remains unclear. In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate. In the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (made by punchcutting, with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer copper bar, creating a matrix. This is then placed into a hand-held mould and a piece of type, or &quot; sort &quot;, is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould. The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or font s. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type-cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times. The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of &quot; movable type &quot;. (For details, see Typography ). [ Was Gutenberg&apos;s type produced by punches and copper matrices? ] { &quot; Modern Book Printing &quot; − sculpture commemorating its inventor Gutenberg } The invention of the making of types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to Gutenberg. However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg&apos;s process was somewhat different. If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variations due to miscasting and inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg&apos;s earliest work shows other variations. [ October 2011 ] In 2001, the physicist Blaise Agüera y Arcas and Princeton librarian Paul Needham, used digital scans of a Papal bull in the Scheide Library, Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the printed text. [ Blaise Agüera y Arcas Needham, Paul Computational analytical bibliography Proceedings Bibliopolis Conference The future history of the book Koninklijke Bibliotheek 2002 November The Hague ( Netherlands ) ] [ http://www.open2.net/gberg_synopsis.html What Did Gutenberg Invent? Aug 16 2011 ] The irregularities in Gutenberg&apos;s type, particularly in simple characters such as the hyphen, suggested that the variations could not have come from either ink smear or from wear and damage on the pieces of metal on the types themselves. While some identical types are clearly used on other pages, other variations, subjected to detailed image analysis, suggested that they could not have been produced from the same matrix. Transmitted light pictures of the page also appeared to reveal substructures in the type that could not arise from traditional punchcutting techniques. They hypothesized that the method may have involved impressing simple shapes to create alphabets in &quot; cuneiform &quot; style in a matrix made of some soft material, perhaps sand. Casting the type would destroy the mould, and the matrix would need to be recreated to make each additional sort. This could explain the variations in the type, as well as the substructures observed in the printed images. Thus, they feel that &quot; the decisive factor for the birth of typography &quot;, the use of reusable moulds for casting type, might have been a more progressive process than was previously thought. [ Adams, James L. Flying Buttresses, Entropy and O-Rings: the World of an Engineer 1991 Harvard University Press 0-674-30688-0 ] They suggest that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in the 1470s. Others have not accepted some or all of their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in other ways, and the truth of the matter remains very uncertain. { Nash, Paul W. &quot; The &apos;first&apos; type of Gutenberg: a note on recent research &quot; in The Private Library, Summer 2004, pp. 86-96. } [ Other hypotheses about European origins ] A 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment from Haarlem to Mainz. While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology. He was an inventor and a goldsmith. However, there is one indirect supporter of the claim that Coster might be the inventor. The author of the Cologne Chronicle of 1499 quotes Ulrich Zell, the first printer of Cologne, that printing was performed in Mainz in 1450, but that some type of printing of lower quality had previously occurred in the Netherlands. However, the chronicle does not mention the name of Coster, [ Juchhoff 1950 131f. ] while it actually credits Gutenberg as the &quot; first inventor of printing &quot; in the very same passage (fol. 312). The first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471, and the Coster connection is today regarded as a mere legend. { Costeriana. While the } { Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition had attributed the invention of the printing press to Coster, the more recent editions of the work attribute it to Gutenberg to reflect, as it says, the common consent that has developed in the 20th century. Typography - Gutenberg and printing in Germany. Encyclopædia Britannica ©2007. } The 19th century printer and typefounder Fournier Le Jeune suggested that Gutenberg might not have been using type cast with a reusable matrix, but possibly wooden types that were carved individually. A similar suggestion was made by Nash in 2004. { See note 19 } This remains possible, albeit entirely unproven. It has also been questioned whether Gutenberg used movable types at all. In 2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of the 42-line Bible revealed an overlapping of letters, suggesting that Gutenberg did not in fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a system somewhat like a modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.

Within the span of only two years, Luther&apos;s tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies throughout Germany and Europe. } [ Duchesne 2006 83 ] Although Gutenberg was financially unsuccessful in his lifetime, the printing technologies spread quickly, and news and books began to travel across Europe much faster than before. It fed the growing Renaissance, and since it greatly facilitated scientific publishing, it was a major catalyst for the later scientific revolution. The capital of printing in Europe shifted to Venice, where visionary printers like Aldus Manutius ensured widespread availability of the major Greek and Latin texts. The claims of an Italian origin for movable type have also focused on this rapid rise of Italy in movable-type printing. This may perhaps be explained by the prior eminence of Italy in the paper and printing trade. Additionally, Italy&apos;s economy was growing rapidly at the time, facilitating the spread of literacy. Christopher Columbus had a geographical book (printed by movable types) bought by his father. That book is in a Spanish museum. Finally, the city of Mainz was sacked in 1462, driving many (including a number of printers and punch cutters) into exile. Printing was also a factor in the Reformation. Martin Luther &apos;s 95 Theses were printed and circulated widely; subsequently he issued broadsheet s outlining his anti- indulgences position (certificates of indulgences were one of the first items Gutenberg had printed). The broadsheet contributed to development of the newspaper. In the decades after Gutenberg, many conservative patrons looked down on cheap printed books; books produced by hand were considered more desirable. Today there is a large antique market for the earliest printed objects. Books printed prior to 1500 are known as incunabula. There are many statues of Gutenberg in Germany, including the famous one by Bertel Thorvaldsen (1837) in Mainz, home to the eponymous Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz and the Gutenberg Museum on the history of early printing. The later publishes the Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, the leading periodical in the field.
