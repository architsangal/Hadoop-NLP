{ 25,000–50,000 men } [ Kaegi 2003 158–159 ] { 12,000 men } [ Kaegi 2003 167 ] { Unknown } { 6,000 men } The Battle of Nineveh was the climactic battle of the Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628. The Byzantine victory broke the power of the Sassanid dynasty and for a period of time restored the empire to its ancient boundaries in the Middle East. This resurgence of power and prestige was not to last, however, as within a matter of decades an Islamic Caliphate emerged from the Arabian desert and once again brought the empire to the brink of destruction. [ Prelude ] When Emperor Maurice was murdered by the usurper Phocas, Khosrau II declared war, ostensibly to avenge his benefactor&apos;s death. While the Persians proved largely successful during the first stages of the war, conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, and even parts of Anatolia, the ascendancy of Heraclius eventually led to the Persians&apos; demise. Heraclius&apos; campaigns altered the balance, forcing the Persians on the defensive and allowing for the Byzantines to regain momentum. Allied with the Avars, the Persians attempted to take Constantinople, but were defeated there. While the Siege of Constantinople was taking place, Heraclius allied with what Byzantine sources called the Khazars under Ziebel, who are identified with the Western Turkic Khaganate of the Göktürks led by Tong Yabghu. [ Kaegi 2003 143 ] plying him with wondrous gifts and a promise of the reward of the porphyrogenita Eudoxia Epiphania. The Caucasus-based Turks responded by sending 40,000 of their men to ravage the Persian empire in 626 to start the Third Perso-Turkic War. [ Norwich 1997 92 ] Joint Byzantine and Göktürks operations were focused on besieging Tiflis [ Kaegi 2003 144 ] [ Invasion of Mesopotamia ] In mid-September 627, leaving Ziebel to continue the siege of Tiflis, Heraclius invaded the Persian heartland, this time with between 25,000 and 50,000 troops and 40,000 Göktürks. The Göktürks, however, quickly deserted him because of the strange winter conditions. [ Kaegi 2003 158 ] Heraclius was tailed by Rhahzadh &apos;s army of 12,000, but managed to evade Rhahzadh and invaded the heartland of Persia, in modern Iraq. Heraclius acquired food and fodder from the countryside, so Rhahzadh, following through countryside already stripped, could not easily find provisions. This resulted in harm to Rhahzadh &apos;s animals. [ Kaegi 2003 159 ] [ Kaegi 2003 160 ] { Battle of Nineveh } On 1 December, Heraclius crossed the Great Zab River and camped near Nineveh. This was a movement from south to north, contrary to the expectation of a southward advance. However, this can be seen as a way to avoid being trapped by the Persian army in case of a defeat. Rhahzadh approached Nineveh from a different position. News that 3,000 Persian reinforcements were approaching reached Heraclius, forcing him to act. He gave the appearance of retreating from Persia by crossing the Tigris. [ Kaegi 2003 161 ] [ Field ] Heraclius had found a plain west of the Great Zab some distance from the ruins of Nineveh. [ Kaegi 2003 162 ] This allowed the Byzantines to take advantage of their strengths in lances and hand-to-hand combat. Furthermore, the fog reduced the Persian advantage in missile troops and allowing the Byzantines to charge without great losses from missile barrages. Walter Kaegi believes that this battle took place near the Karamlays Creek. [ Kaegi 2003 163 ] [ The battle ] Rhahzadh deployed his forces into three masses and attacked. [ Kaegi 2003 161–162 ] Heraclius feigned retreat to lead the Persians to the plains before reversing his troops to the surprise of the Persians. After eight hours of fighting, the Persians suddenly retreated to nearby foothills, but it was not a rout. [ Norwich 1997 93 ] [ Kaegi 2003 163 ] 6,000 Persians fell. [ Kaegi 2003 169 ] Nikephoros &apos; Brief History mentions that Rhahzadh challenged Heraclius to personal combat. Heraclius accepted and killed Rhahzadh in a single thrust; two other challengers fought and also lost. But either way, Rhahzadh died sometime in the battle. [ Kaegi 2003 167 ] The 3,000 Persian reinforcements arrived too late and likely joined with the remnants of Rhahzadh &apos;s force.

[ Kaegi 2003 168 ] However, this victory was significant enough to shatter the resistance of the Persians. With no Persian army left to oppose him, Heraclius&apos; victorious army plundered Dastagird, Khosrau&apos;s palace, and gained tremendous riches while recovering 300 captured Byzantine/Roman standards accumulated over years of warfare. [ Kaegi 2003 173 ] Khosrau had already fled to the mountains of Susiana to try to rally support for the defense of Ctesiphon. [ Oman 1893 211 ] Heraclius could not attack Ctesiphon itself because the Nahrawan Canal was blocked due to the collapse of a bridge leading over it. The Persian army rebelled and overthrew Khosrau II, raising his son Kavadh II, also known as Siroes, in his stead. Khosrau perished in a dungeon after suffering for five days on bare sustenance—he was shot to death slowly with arrows on the fifth day. [ Norwich 1997 94 ] Kavadh immediately sent peace offers to Heraclius. Heraclius did not impose harsh terms, knowing that his own empire was also near exhaustion. Under the peace treaty, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, and of great spiritual significance, the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.
