Even though the area around Breese, Illinois was first settled in 1816, itwas not until 1835 that Germans came to the town to farm because of the flat fertile land there.Twenty years after the German’s first immigration, the Mississippi and OhioRailroad was completed. The early pioneers were enthralled by the thought oftransportation by railroad. The Chicago based company Sanger Kamp &amp; Co. bought 80acres of land near the railroad. Twenty-four acres were laid out with the railroad splittingthe original town with some acres on the north side and south side creating BreeseTownship, February 3, 1855. Today citizens of Breese use the terms north side andsouth side in determining a certain location. Also most roads in Breese are based on which side of the railroad the street is. Late in 1855, forty Catholic immigrants, wanting to fulfill their religious needs,had the idea of constructing a church. Their desires were realized when two years laterthe Sanger Kamp &amp; Co. gave half of one of its 80 acres to the Catholics’ project. ByDecember 1869, St. Dominic’s Catholic Church was completed.Breese was first recognized as a town on April 11, 1871, and later became avillage on September 23, 1876. As a result, the construction of the village hall had begun.This project was completed in 1885. Seven years later a volunteer fire department wasorganized. The ever-growing population was then acknowledged as a city on January 19,1905. The mayor of this new city was Henry Hummert. Realizing that Breese would need some improvements, the mayor authorized theconstruction of an electric light plant that was completed in 1906. The streets of Breesewere also topped with road oil in 1911. The next year improvements to the city’s waterworks facility were also made. However, things took a turn for the worse when, in 1914, a scarlet fever swept thecommunity and its surrounding area and forced all the schools to close. Only four yearslater, still in the wake of the scarlet fever, the flu epidemic spread through the area.After the diseases ended, further improvements to the city were made and are still occurring.
