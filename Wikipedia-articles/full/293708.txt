[ Sport in Asian society: past and present 220 J. A. Mangan, Fan Hong 978-0-7146-8330-0 2002 Frank Cass Publishers ] Sepak takraw differs from the similar sport of volleyball in its use of a rattan ball and only allowing players to use their feet, knee, chest and head to touch the ball. It is a popular sport in Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, the game is called sepak raga or &quot; takraw &quot;. It is also thuck thay ( Lao : &quot; twine &quot; and &quot; kick &quot; ) while in Thailand it is sometimes called takraw. In Myanmar it is known as chin lone. In the Philippines it is known as sipa, meaning &quot; kick &quot;. Similar games include footbag net, footvolley, football tennis, bossaball, jianzi and sipa. These similar games all involve keepie uppie s. [ Etymology ] &quot; Sepak &quot; is the Malay word for kick and &quot; takraw &quot; is the Thai word for a woven ball, therefore sepak takraw quite literally means to kick ball. The choosing of this name for the sport was essentially a compromise between Malaysia and Thailand, the two powerhouse countries of the sport. { Hackworth, M. (2006). Sepak Takraw. Sierra Star Journal,644, 858-101. } [ History ] Earliest historical evidence shows that the game was played in the 15th century&apos;s Malacca Sultanate, for it is mentioned in the Malay historical text, &quot; Sejarah Melayu &quot; (Malay Annals). [ Dunsmore Susi Sepak Raga University of Michigan 1983 2 ] The Malay Annals described in details the incident of Raja Muhammad, a son of Sultan Mansur Shah who was accidentally hit with a rattan ball by Tun Besar, a son of Tun Perak, in a Sepak raga game. The ball hit Raja Muhammad&apos;s headgear and knocked it down to the ground. In anger, Raja Muhammad immediately stabbed and killed Tun Besar, whereupon some of Tun Besar&apos;s kinsmen retaliated and wanted to kill Raja Muhammad. However, Tun Perak managed to restrain them from such an act of treason by saying that he would no longer accept Raja Muhammad as the Sultan&apos;s heir. As a result of this incident, Sultan Mansur Shah ordered his son out of Malacca and had him installed as the ruler of Pahang. [ Brown Charles Cuthbert David Mumford Sejarah Melayu; or, Malay annals: an annotated translation [from the Malay] Oxford University Press 1970 89 ] In Indonesia, sepak takraw was spread from nearby Malacca across the strait to Riau islands and Riau area in Sumatra as early as 16th century, where it is also called as Sepak Raga in local Malay tongue, { Permainan Sepak Raga } { Sepak Raga, Permainan Tradisional Masyarakat Di Propinsi Kepulauan Riau } at that time some of Sumatran areas were part of Malacca sultanate. From there the Malay people spread across archipelago and introduced the game to Buginese people in Sulawesi. Then the game is developed as Buginese traditional game which is called &quot; Raga &quot; (the players are called &quot; Pa&apos;Raga &quot; ). The &quot; Raga &quot; can trace its origin from Malacca Sultanate, [ http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1224/permainan-marraga-akraga Permainan Marraga/Akraga (Bugis) Melayuonline 2010-08-04 ] and was popular in South Sulawesi since 19th century. Some men playing &quot; Raga &quot; encircling within a group, the ball is passed from one to another and the man who kicked the ball highest is the winner. &quot; Raga &quot; is also played for fun by demonstrating some tricks, such as kicking the ball and putting it on top of player&apos;s head holds by tengkolok bugis (Bugis cloth headgear similar to Malay tanjak). In Bangkok, murals at Wat Phra Kaeo which was built in 1785, depict the Hindu god Hanuman playing sepak takraw in a ring with a troop of monkey s. Other historical accounts mention the game earlier during the reign of King Naresuan (1590–1605) of Ayutthaya. The game remained in its circle form for hundreds of years, and the modern version of sepak takraw began taking shape in Thailand sometime during early 1740s. In 1829 the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for takraw competition. [ October 2011 ] Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, takraw was introduced to the curriculum in Siamese schools. The game became such a cherished local custom that another exhibition of volleyball-style takraw was staged to celebrate the kingdom’s first constitution in 1933, the year after Thailand abolished absolute monarchy. In the Philippines the sport was called &quot; sipa &quot; and along with traditional martial arts survived the three century Spanish colonization. It is a popular sport played by children in Philippines, this is their national sport. Sepak Takraw is included in Philippine&apos;s elementary and highschool curriculum.In Myanmar, or Burma, it was dubbed &quot; Chinlone &quot;, in Laos &quot; Kator &quot;, &quot; cầu mây &quot; in Vietnam and in Indonesia &quot; Raga &quot; or &quot; Sepak Takraw &quot;. It is believed that many variations of the game evolved from an ancient Chinese military exercise, where soldiers would try to keep a feathered shuttlecock airborne by kicking it back and forth between two people. As the sport developed, the animal hide and chicken feathers were eventually replaced by balls made of woven strips of rattan. [ July 2011 ] The first versions of sepak takraw were not so much of a competition, but rather cooperative displays of skill designed to exercise the body, improve dexterity and loosen the limbs after long periods of sitting, standing or working. [ July 2011 ] The modern version of sepak takraw is fiercely competitive and began taking shape in Thailand almost 200 years ago. In 1829, the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for the game. [ October 2011 ] Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, sepak takraw was introduced to the Physical Training curriculum in schools. [ July 2011 ] By the 1940s, the net version of the game had spread throughout Southeast Asia, and formal rules were introduced. This sport became officially known as &apos;sepak takraw&apos;. [ Competition ] International play is now governed by ISTAF, the International Sepak Takraw Federation. The King&apos;s Cup World Championships are held every year in Thailand. Sepak takraw is now a regular sport event in the Asian Games and the Southeast Asian Games. [ Canada ] It was the Laotian people who first brought Sepak Takraw into Canada when they immigrated as refugees in the 1970s. But the game got exposure outside the Laotian communities and really started taking off when a Saskatchewan teacher, Richard (Rick) Engel, who encountered Sepak Takraw while living in Asia, included it in Asian Sport, Education &amp; Culture (ASEC) International’s School Presentation Program. Sepak Takraw was so well received by schools that it became part of ASEC’s mandate to help introduce, promote and organise the sport right across the country. Then in May 1998, after getting many schools playing Sepak Takraw, and by networking with experienced players, ASEC International organised the first Canadian inter-provincial tournament to include men’s, boys and girls teams. By the end of 1998, Engel was sent to Bangkok, Thailand to film at the 14th King’s Cup Sepak Takraw World Championships – the footage of which was used to produce a widely used instructional Sepak Takraw Video/DVD, called, “Sepak Takraw – Just for Kicks”. Then on December 11, 1998, the Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC) was incorporated to organise and govern the sport nationally. Its office was set up in Regina, SK, where there are experienced players and organisational support, and where it could share the resources and office space of the already established ASEC International, a committee from which has now become Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc. The first annual Canadian Open Sepak Takraw Championships (a national and international tournament event) were held in May 1999 in Regina, SK, and have over the years attracted teams from across Canada, USA, Japan, Malaysia and China. That same year Canada also attended its first International Sepak Takraw Federation (ISTAF) Congress and was accepted as members of ISTAF, which governs the sport globally. Then in 2000, Rick Engel, Perry Senko and Brydon Blacklaws played for Team Canada and earned a silver medal in the entry level division of the King&apos;s Cup World Sepak Takraw Championships in Thailand. Another major milestone was achieved on December 3, 2000, when STAC and the sport of Sepak Takraw became an official class E Member of the Canadian Olympic Committee. Canada has since contributed much to the development of Sepak Takraw world-wide, with Engel authoring 3 Instructional Sepak Takraw Books and helping produce 5 Sepak Takraw DVD&apos;s, while STAC does the publishing... the most notable book being &quot; Sepak Takraw 101 - The Complete Coaching/Instructional Manual for Sepak Takraw (Kick Volleyball) &quot;, the 3rd Edition of which has also been translated and published in the Indonesian Language and released in Indonesia through a government Education project. Engel has found himself to be in demand, introducing the sport and conducting Sepak Takraw Skills Clinics in Schools and Sessions at Phys. Ed. Teachers&apos; Conferences all over Canada, USA and Europe. [ Japan ] A Japan team composed of BURAT university students debuted—along with the sports itself—at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. While there are no professional teams in Japan, colleges such as Asia University, Chiba University, Waseda University and Keio University have formed their own teams. [ http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/sport/sepak-takraw/ Sepak Takraw: By Fred Varcoe February 4, 2010 Metropolis Magazine 2010-02-04 ] [ United States ] The earliest accounts of organized takraw in the United States involve a group of students from Northrop University (Greg St. Pierre, Thomas Gong, Joel &quot; big bird &quot; Nelson, and Mark Kimitsuka) in 1986 in Inglewood, California, learning about and playing the sport in Los Angeles. { The Log, Northrop University Student Newspaper, November 5, 1987, Vol 35, No. 3. } Malaysian students attending the University often enjoyed playing the sport on a court on top of the dormitory cafeteria. They taught a handful of curious American students how to play, which in turn inspired the Malaysian Airline system to sponsor a U.S. team from the university to attend the National Tournament in Kuala Lumpur in November 1987. The Northrop team played in a bracket of international new teams with Korea, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The U.S. team beat Sri Lanka and Australia to bring home the gold. { Northrop University Magazine, December 1987, Vol 3, No. 4. } Takraw really began to take off, however, in the late 1980s when Kurt Sonderegger, an American working in Switzerland, met a fellow American who showed him a bouncy ball made of woven strips of rattan. The traveller told Sonderegger that the ball was from Thailand and gave him the ball as a gift. Sonderegger was a soccer fan, and takraw had an immediate appeal to him. On a whim, Sonderegger booked a trip to Thailand to find out more. While in Thailand, Sonderegger discovered the actual sport of sepak takraw and was hooked. Los Angeles&apos;s Asian community and Northrop&apos;s team had already established a takraw community in and around L.A. Sonderegger moved to Los Angeles, founded the United States Takraw Association, and started a business that sold plastic takraw balls. In 1989, he was sent an invitation from the International Sepak Takraw Federation, and Kurt along with a few of the Northrop group traveled to represent the United States in the World Championships. The team was beaten badly but the takraw world was enchanted with the fact that non-Asian teams had competed at the World Championships. [ http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1005482/index.htm CNN Video August 8, 1994 ] [ Rules and regulations ] Measurements of court and equipment often vary among tournaments and organizations that operate from a recreational to a competitive level; international competitive rules and regulation are used in this section. There two types of event categories: the regu and the doubles regu. The regu category is played by three players on each team while the doubles regu is played by two players on each team. [ Expressions ] Sepak is the Malay word for &quot; kick &quot;. Takraw is the Thai word for the hand-woven rattan ball originally used in the game. So the game is essentially &quot; kick ball &quot;. Regu is Malay for &quot; team &quot; (four people, three starters, and one substitute player). { Kalish,J. (2004). Talking Takraw[Electronic Version].
