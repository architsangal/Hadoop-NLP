The disease was named after gastroenterologist Burrill Bernard Crohn, who, in 1932, together with two other colleagues at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, described a series of patients with inflammation of the terminal ileum, the area most commonly affected by the illness.

Med. 67 3 263–8 2000 10828911 ] [ Classification ] { American Gastroenterological Association. } Crohn&apos;s disease is one type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It typically manifests in the gastrointestinal tract and can be categorized by the specific tract region affected. A disease of both the ileum (the last part of the small intestine which connects to the large intestine ), and the large intestine, Ileocolic Crohn&apos;s accounts for fifty percent of cases. Crohn&apos;s ileitis, manifest in the ileum only, accounts for thirty percent of cases, while Crohn&apos;s colitis, of the large intestine, accounts for the remaining twenty percent of cases and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from ulcerative colitis. Gastroduodenal Crohn&apos;s disease causes inflammation in the stomach and first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. Jejunoileitis causes spotty patches of inflammation in the top half of the small intestine, called the jejunum (MedlinePlus 2010). The disease can attack any part of the digestive tract, from mouth to anus. However, individuals affected by the disease rarely fall outside these three classifications, with presentations in other areas. Crohn&apos;s disease may also be categorized by the behavior of disease as it progresses. These categorizations formalized in the Vienna classification of the disease. [ 10.1002/ibd.3780060103 Gasche C, Scholmerich J, Brynskov J, D&apos;Haens G, Hanauer S, Irvine E, Jewell D, Rachmilewitz D, Sachar D, Sandborn W, Sutherland L A simple classification of Crohn&apos;s disease: report of the Working Party for the World Congresses of Gastroenterology, Vienna 1998 Inflamm Bowel Dis 6 1 8–15 2000 10701144 ] There are three categories of disease presentation in Crohn&apos;s disease: stricturing, penetrating, and inflammatory. Stricturing disease causes narrowing of the bowel that may lead to bowel obstruction or changes in the caliber of the feces. Penetrating disease creates abnormal passageways ( fistula e ) between the bowel and other structures, such as the skin. Inflammatory disease (or nonstricturing, nonpenetrating disease) causes inflammation without causing strictures or fistulae. [ Dubinsky MC, Fleshner PP.

People with Crohn&apos;s disease experience chronic recurring periods of flare-ups and remission. [ David Zieve George F Longstreth ADAM Health Illustrated Encyclopedia Crohn&apos;s Disease http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/crohns-disease October 18, 2009 2010-08-16 ] Abdominal pain may be the initial symptom of Crohn&apos;s disease. It is often accompanied by diarrhea, especially in those who have had surgery. The diarrhea may or may not be bloody. The nature of the diarrhea in Crohn&apos;s disease depends on the part of the small intestine or colon involved. Ileitis typically results in large-volume, watery feces. Colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of higher frequency. Fecal consistency may range from solid to watery. In severe cases, an individual may have more than 20 bowel movements per day and may need to awaken at night to defecate.

Bloody bowel movements are typically intermittent, and may be bright or dark red in color. In the setting of severe Crohn&apos;s colitis, bleeding may be copious. Flatulence and bloating may also add to the intestinal discomfort. Symptoms caused by intestinal stenosis are also common in Crohn&apos;s disease. Abdominal pain is often most severe in areas of the bowel with stenoses. In the setting of severe stenosis, vomiting and nausea may indicate the beginnings of small bowel obstruction.

At the opposite end of the gastrointestinal tract, the mouth may be affected by non-healing sores ( aphthous ulcer s ). Rarely, the esophagus, and stomach may be involved in Crohn&apos;s disease. These can cause symptoms including difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ), upper abdominal pain, and vomiting. [ Fix Oren K. Jorge A. Soto, Charles W. Andrews and Francis A.

Among children, growth failure is common. Many children are first diagnosed with Crohn&apos;s disease based on inability to maintain growth. As it may manifest at the time of the growth spurt in puberty, up to 30% of children with Crohn&apos;s disease may have retardation of growth. [ Büller H.A. 1997 Problems in diagnosis of IBD in children The Netherlands Journal of Medicine 50 2 S8–S11 10.1016/S0300-2977(96)00064-2 9050326 ] Fever may also be present, though fevers greater than 38.5  ˚C (101.3  ˚F) are uncommon unless there is a complication such as an abscess. Among older individuals, Crohn&apos;s disease may manifest as weight loss, usually related to decreased food intake, since individuals with intestinal symptoms from Crohn&apos;s disease often feel better when they do not eat and might lose their appetite.

Inflammation may also involve the white part of the eye ( sclera ), a condition called episcleritis. Both episcleritis and uveitis can lead to loss of vision if untreated. Crohn&apos;s disease is associated with a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative spondyloarthropathy. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more joint s ( arthritis ) or muscle insertions ( enthesitis ). The arthritis can affect larger joints, such as the knee or shoulder, or may exclusively involve the small joints of the hands and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to ankylosing spondylitis if the entire spine is involved or simply sacroiliitis if only the lower spine is involved. The symptoms of arthritis include painful, warm, swollen, stiff joints and loss of joint mobility or function. [ Healthline Networks, Inc.

One type of skin manifestation, erythema nodosum, presents as red nodules usually appearing on the shins. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue, and is characterized by septal panniculitis. Another skin lesion, pyoderma gangrenosum, is typically a painful ulcerating nodule. Crohn&apos;s disease also increases the risk of blood clots; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of deep venous thrombosis, while difficulty breathing may be a result of pulmonary embolism. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which the immune system attacks the red blood cells, is also more common in Crohn&apos;s disease and may cause fatigue, pallor, and other symptoms common in anemia. Clubbing, a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may also be a result of Crohn&apos;s disease. Finally, Crohn&apos;s disease may cause osteoporosis, or thinning of the bones. Individuals with osteoporosis are at increased risk of bone fracture s. [ Bernstein Michael Sue Irwin and Gordon R.

Obstruction typically occurs from strictures or adhesions that narrow the lumen, blocking the passage of the intestinal contents. Fistulae can develop between two loops of bowel, between the bowel and bladder, between the bowel and vagina, and between the bowel and skin. Abscesses are walled off collections of infection, which can occur in the abdomen or in the perianal area in Crohn&apos;s disease sufferers. Crohn&apos;s is responsible for 10% of vesicoenteric fistulae, and is the most common cause of ileovesical fistulae. { http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/442000-overview } Crohn&apos;s disease also increases the risk of cancer in the area of inflammation.

[ http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue33/crohns.htm New insights into Crohn&apos;s Disease ] [ Pathophysiology ] { colectomy showing transmural inflammation } During a colonoscopy, biopsies of the colon are often taken to confirm the diagnosis. Certain characteristic features of the pathology seen point toward Crohn&apos;s disease; it shows a transmural pattern of inflammation, meaning the inflammation may span the entire depth of the intestinal wall. Ulceration is an outcome seen in highly active disease. There is usually an abrupt transition between unaffected tissue and the ulcer - a characteristic sign known as skip lesions. Under a microscope, biopsies of the affected colon may show mucosa l inflammation, characterized by focal infiltration of neutrophils, a type of inflammatory cell, into the epithelium. This typically occurs in the area overlying lymphoid aggregates. These neutrophils, along with mononuclear cells, may infiltrate the crypts, leading to inflammation (crypititis) or abscess (crypt abscess). Granuloma s, aggregates of macrophage derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn&apos;s disease. The granulomas of Crohn&apos;s disease do not show &quot; caseation &quot;, a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination characteristic of granulomas associated with infections, such as tuberculosis. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage, as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal villi, atypical branching of the crypts, and a change in the tissue type ( metaplasia ). One example of such metaplasia, Paneth cell metaplasia, involves development of Paneth cells (typically found in the small intestine) in other parts of the gastrointestinal system. { Crawford JM. &quot; The Gastrointestinal tract, Chapter 17 &quot;.

Even with a full battery of tests, it may not be possible to diagnose Crohn&apos;s with complete certainty; a colonoscopy is approximately 70% effective in diagnosing the disease, with further tests being less effective. Disease in the small bowel is particularly difficult to diagnose, as a traditional colonoscopy allows access to only the colon and lower portions of the small intestines; introduction of the capsule endoscopy { HCP: Pill Cam, Capsule Endoscopy, Esophageal Endoscopy } aids in endoscopic diagnosis. Multinucleated giant cells, a common finding in the lesions of Crohn&apos;s disease, are less common in the lesions of lichen nitidus.

On occasion, the colonoscope can travel past the terminal ileum, but it varies from patient to patient. During the procedure, the gastroenterologist can also perform a biopsy, taking small samples of tissue for laboratory analysis, which may help confirm a diagnosis. As 30% of Crohn&apos;s disease involves only the ileum, cannula tion of the terminal ileum is required in making the diagnosis. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum, but not the rectum, is suggestive of Crohn&apos;s disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata. The utility of capsule endoscopy for this, however, is still uncertain.

[ Radiologic tests ] A small bowel follow-through may suggest the diagnosis of Crohn&apos;s disease and is useful when the disease involves only the small intestine. Because colonoscopy and gastroscopy allow direct visualization of only the terminal ileum and beginning of the duodenum, they cannot be used to evaluate the remainder of the small intestine. As a result, a barium follow-through X-ray, wherein barium sulfate suspension is ingested and fluoroscopic images of the bowel are taken over time, is useful for looking for inflammation and narrowing of the small bowel.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of acupuncture, though further studies are warranted. Homeopathy is frequently used in Germany as a treatment for Crohn&apos;s disease, though no clinical trial s exist that demonstrate homeopathy is effective. [ Prognosis ] [ October 2009 ] Crohn&apos;s disease is a chronic condition for which there is no cure. It is characterised by periods of improvement followed by episodes when symptoms flare up. With treatment, most people achieve a healthy weight, and the mortality rate for the disease is relatively low. However, Crohn&apos;s disease is associated with an increased risk of small bowel and colorectal carcinoma, including bowel cancer. [ Canavan C. K. R. Abrams, J.

It is rarely diagnosed in early childhood. It usually strikes females who are pediatric patients more severely than males.

It is useful in maintenance of remission for those no longer taking corticosteroids. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are antibiotics used to treat Crohn&apos;s that have colonic or perianal involvement, although, in the United States, this use has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are also used for treatment of complications, including abscesses and other infections accompanying Crohn&apos;s disease. Thalidomide has shown response in reversing endoscopic evidence of disease.
