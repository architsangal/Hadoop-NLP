[ Wald 1984 299–300 ] The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called &quot; black &quot; because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. [ Gravity from the ground up Bernard F. Schutz Cambridge University Press 2003 0-521-45506-5 110 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DP_T0xxhDcsIC ] [ Davies P. C. W. Thermodynamics of Black Holes http://cosmos.asu.edu/publications/papers/ThermodynamicTheoryofBlackHoles%2034.pdf Reports on Progress in Physics 41 1978 8 1313–1355 10.1088/0034-4885/41/8/004 1978RPPh...41.1313D ] Quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater. Objects whose gravity field is too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was not fully appreciated for another four decades. Long considered a mathematical curiosity, it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed black holes were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron star s sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when a star of more than 5 solar masses runs out of energy fuel. This results in the outer layers of gas being thrown out in a supernova explosion. The core of the star collapses and becomes super dense where even the atomic nuclei are squeezed together. The energy density at the core goes to infinity. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black hole s of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies. In particular, there is strong evidence of a black hole of more than 4  million solar mass es at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with light and other electromagnetic radiation. From stellar movement, the mass and location of an invisible companion object can be calculated. A half-dozen or so binary star systems have been discovered by astronomers where one of the stars is invisible, yet must surely exist since it pulls with enough gravitational force on the other visible star to make it orbit around their common center of gravity. Therefore these invisible stars are thought to be good candidate black holes. Astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems by studying the movement of their companion stars in this way. [ History ] { gravitational lens ing by a black hole, which distorts the image of a } { galaxy in the background ( } { larger animation ) } The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was first put forward by geologist John Michell in a letter written to Henry Cavendish in 1783 of the Royal Society : [ Michell J. 1784 On the Means of Discovering the Distance, Magnitude, &amp; c. of the Fixed Stars, in Consequence of the Diminution of the Velocity of Their Light, in Case Such a Diminution Should be Found to Take Place in any of Them, and Such Other Data Should be Procured from Observations, as Would be Farther Necessary for That Purpose Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 74 0 35–57 1784RSPT...74...35M 10.1098/rstl.1784.0008 harv 106576 ] In 1796, mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du système du Monde (it was removed from later editions). [ C. C. Gillispie 2000 Pierre-Simon Laplace, 1749-1827: a life in exact science Princeton paperbacks 175 Princeton University Press 0-691-05027-9 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DiohJomX0IWgC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA175 ] [ Israel W.

Israel W. 1989 300 Years of Gravitation Cambridge University Press 978-0-521-37976-2 ] Such &quot; dark star s &quot; were largely ignored in the nineteenth century, since it was not understood how a massless wave such as light could be influenced by gravity. [ Thorne 1994 123–124 ] [ General relativity ] In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having earlier shown that gravity does influence light&apos;s motion. Only a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to Einstein field equations, which describes the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass. [ Schwarzschild K. 1916 Über das Gravitationsfeld eines Massenpunktes nach der Einsteinschen Theorie http://www.archive.org/stream/sitzungsberichte1916deutsch#page%2F188%2Fmode%2F2up Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 7 189–196 harv ] { and } [ Schwarzschild K. 1916 Über das Gravitationsfeld eines Kugel aus inkompressibler Flüssigkeit nach der Einsteinschen Theorie http://www.archive.org/stream/sitzungsberichte1916deutsch#page%2F424%2Fmode%2F2up Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 18 424–434 harv ] A few months after Schwarzschild, Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave the same solution for the point mass and wrote more extensively about its properties. [ Droste, J. 1915 On the field of a single centre in Einstein&apos;s theory of gravitation Koninklijke Nederlandsche Akademie van Wetenschappen Proceedings 17 3 998–1011 harv ] This solution had a peculiar behaviour at what is now called the Schwarzschild radius, where it became singular, meaning that some of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the time. In 1924, Arthur Eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of coordinates (see Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates ), although it took until 1933 for Georges Lemaître to realize that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was an unphysical coordinate singularity. [ &apos;t Hooft G. 2009 Introduction to the Theory of Black Holes http://www.phys.uu.nl/~thooft/lectures/blackholes/BH_lecturenotes.pdf Institute for Theoretical Physics / Spinoza Insitute 47–48 ] In 1931, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar calculated, using special relativity, that a non-rotating body of electron-degenerate matter above a certain limiting mass (now called the Chandrasekhar limit at 1.4 solar masses) has no stable solutions. [ G. Venkataraman Chandrasekhar and his limit 89 Universities Press 1992 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DHNSdDFOJ4wkC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA89 81-7371-035-X ] His arguments were opposed by many of his contemporaries like Eddington and Lev Landau, who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would stop the collapse. [ Detweiler S. 1981 Resource letter BH-1: Black holes American Journal of Physics 49 5 394–400 10.1119/1.12686 harv 1981AmJPh..49..394D ] They were partly correct: a white dwarf slightly more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star, [ Harpaz A. 1994 Stellar evolution http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dkd4VEZv8oo0C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA105 A K Peters 105 1-56881-012-1 ] which is itself stable because of the Pauli exclusion principle. But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and others predicted that neutron stars above approximately three solar masses (the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit ) would collapse into black holes for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar, and concluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least some stars from collapsing to black holes. [ Oppenheimer J. R. Volkoff G. M. 1939 On Massive Neutron Cores Physical Review 55 4 374–381 10.1103/PhysRev.55.374 harv 1939PhRv...55..374O ] Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called &quot; frozen stars, &quot; [ Ruffini R. Wheeler J. A. 1971 Introducing the black hole http://authors.library.caltech.edu/14972/1/Ruffini2009p1645Phys_Today.pdf Physics Today 1 30–41 harv ] because an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius. [ Golden age ] [ Golden age of general relativity ] In 1958, David Finkelstein identified the Schwarzschild surface as an event horizon, &quot; a perfect unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it in only one direction &quot;. [ Finkelstein D. 1958 Past-Future Asymmetry of the Gravitational Field of a Point Particle Physical Review 110 4 965–967 10.1103/PhysRev.110.965 harv 1958PhRv..110..965F ] This did not strictly contradict Oppenheimer&apos;s results, but extended them to include the point of view of infalling observers. Finkelstein&apos;s solution extended the Schwarzschild solution for the future of observers falling into a black hole. A complete extension had already been found by Martin Kruskal, who was urged to publish it. [ Kruskal M. 1960 Maximal Extension of Schwarzschild Metric Physical Review 119 5 1743 10.1103/PhysRev.119.1743 1960PhRv..119.1743K ] These results came at the beginning of the golden age of general relativity, which was marked by general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research. This process was helped by the discovery of pulsar s in 1967, [ 1 Hewish A. Bell S. J. Pilkington J. D. H. Scott P. F. Collins R. A. 1968 Observation of a Rapidly Pulsating Radio Source Nature 217 5130 709–713 10.1038/217709a0 harv 1968Natur.217..709H ] [ 1 Pilkington J. D. H. Hewish A. Bell S. J. Cole T.

[ Hewish A. 1970 Pulsars Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics 8 1 265–296 1970ARA &amp; A...8..265H 10.1146/annurev.aa.08.090170.001405 ] Until that time, neutron stars, like black holes, were regarded as just theoretical curiosities; but the discovery of pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of compact objects that might be formed by gravitational collapse. In this period more general black hole solutions were found. In 1963, Roy Kerr found the exact solution for a rotating black hole. Two years later, Ezra Newman found the axisymmetric solution for a black hole that is both rotating and electrically charged. [ 1 Newman E. T. Couch E. Chinnapared K. Exton A. Prakash A. Torrence R. 1965 Metric of a Rotating, Charged Mass Journal of Mathematical Physics 6 6 918 10.1063/1.1704351 1965JMP.....6..918N ] Through the work of Werner Israel, [ Israel W. 1967 Event Horizons in Static Vacuum Space-Times Physical Review 164 5 1776 10.1103/PhysRev.164.1776 1967PhRv..164.1776I ] Brandon Carter, [ Carter B. 1971 Axisymmetric Black Hole Has Only Two Degrees of Freedom Physical Review Letters 26 6 331 10.1103/PhysRevLett.26.331 1971PhRvL..26..331C ] [ Carter B. 1977 The vacuum black hole uniqueness theorem and its conceivable generalisations Proceedings of the 1st Marcel Grossmann meeting on general relativity 243–254 ] and David Robinson [ Robinson D. 1975 Uniqueness of the Kerr Black Hole Physical Review Letters 34 14 905 10.1103/PhysRevLett.34.905 1975PhRvL..34..905R ] the no-hair theorem emerged, stating that a stationary black hole solution is completely described by the three parameters of the Kerr–Newman metric; mass, angular momentum, and electric charge. For a long time, [ September 2011 ] it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole solutions were pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions imposed, and that the singularities would not appear in generic situations. This view was held in particular by Vladimir Belinsky, Isaak Khalatnikov, and Evgeny Lifshitz, who tried to prove that no singularities appear in generic solutions. However, in the late sixties Roger Penrose [ Penrose R. 1965 Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities Physical Review Letters 14 3 57 10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57 1965PhRvL..14...57P ] and Stephen Hawking used global techniques to prove that singularities are generic. [ Ford L. H. 2003 The Classical Singularity Theorems and Their Quantum Loopholes International Journal of Theoretical Physics 42 6 1219 10.1023/A:1025754515197 ] Work by James Bardeen, Jacob Bekenstein, Carter, and Hawking in the early 1970s led to the formulation of black hole thermodynamics. [ Bardeen J. M. Carter B. Hawking S. W. 1973 The four laws of black hole mechanics Communications in Mathematical Physics 31 2 161–170 10.1007/BF01645742 MR0334798 1125.83309 harv 1973CMaPh..31..161B ] These laws describe the behaviour of a black hole in close analogy to the laws of thermodynamics by relating mass to energy, area to entropy, and surface gravity to temperature. The analogy was completed when Hawking, in 1974, showed that quantum field theory predicts that black holes should radiate like a black body with a temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole. The term &quot; black hole &quot; was first publicly used by John Wheeler during a lecture in 1967. Although he is usually credited with coining the phrase, he always insisted that it was suggested to him by somebody else. The first recorded use of the term is in a 1964 letter by Anne Ewing to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. [ Quinion M. 26 April 2008 Black Hole World Wide Words http://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tw-bla1.htm 2008-06-17 ] After Wheeler&apos;s use of the term, it was quickly adopted in general use. [ Properties and structure ] The no-hair theorem states that, once it achieves a stable condition after formation, a black hole has only three independent physical properties: mass, charge, and angular momentum. [ Heusler M. 1998 Stationary Black Holes: Uniqueness and Beyond Living Reviews in Relativity 1 6 http://www.livingreviews.org/Articles/Volume1/1998-6heusler/ 2011-02-08 harv ] Any two black holes that share the same values for these properties, or parameters, are indistinguishable according to classical (i.e. non- quantum ) mechanics. These properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole. For example, a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of Gauss&apos;s law, the ADM mass, far away from the black hole. [ Carroll 2004 253 ] Likewise, the angular momentum can be measured from far away using frame dragging by the gravitomagnetic field. When an object falls into a black hole, any information about the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is lost to outside observers. The behavior of the horizon in this situation is a dissipative system that is closely analogous to that of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and electrical resistance —the membrane paradigm. [ Black holes: the membrane paradigm Thorne K. S. Price R. H. Yale University Press 1986 978-0-300-03770-8 ] This is different from other field theories like electromagnetism, which do not have any friction or resistivity at the microscopic level, because they are time-reversible. Because a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very little information about what went in. The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole horizon, including the total baryon number, lepton number, and all the other nearly conserved pseudo-charges [ September 2011 ] of particle physics. This behavior is so puzzling that it has been called the black hole information loss paradox.

These black holes are often referred to as Schwarzschild black hole s after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1916. According to Birkhoff&apos;s theorem, it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric. [ Hawking Ellis 1973 Appendix B ] This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass. The popular notion of a black hole &quot; sucking in everything &quot; in its surroundings is therefore only correct near a black hole&apos;s horizon; far away, the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass. [ Michael A. Seeds Dana E. Backman Perspectives on Astronomy 167 Cengage Learning 2007 0-495-11352-2 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DCXom04KGIL8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA167 ] Solutions describing more general black holes also exist. Charged black hole s are described by the Reissner–Nordström metric, while the Kerr metric describes a rotating black hole. The most general stationary black hole solution known is the Kerr–Newman metric, which describes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum. [ Shapiro S. L. Teukolsky S. A. Black holes, white dwarfs, and neutron stars: the physics of compact objects 357 John Wiley and Sons 1983 0-471-87316-0 ] While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass. In Planck units, the total electric charge  Q and the total angular momentum  J are expected to satisfy Q^2+\left ( \tfrac{J}{M} \right )^2\le M^2\, for a black hole of mass M. Black holes saturating this inequality are called extremal. Solutions of Einstein&apos;s equations that violate this inequality exist, but they do not possess an event horizon. These solutions have so-called naked singularities that can be observed from the outside, and hence are deemed unphysical. The cosmic censorship hypothesis rules out the formation of such singularities, when they are created through the gravitational collapse of realistic matter. [ Wald R. M. Robert Wald Gravitational Collapse and Cosmic Censorship 1997 gr-qc/9710068 gr-qc ] This is supported by numerical simulations. [ Berger B. K. 2002 http://www.livingreviews.org/lrr-2002-1 Numerical Approaches to Spacetime Singularities Living Reviews in Relativity 5 2007-08-04 harv ] Due to the relatively large strength of the electromagnetic force, black holes forming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star. Rotation, however, is expected to be a common feature of compact objects. The black-hole candidate binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 [ J. E. McClintock R. Shafee R. Narayan R. A. Remillard S. W.

The size of a black hole, as determined by the radius of the event horizon, or Schwarzschild radius, is roughly proportional to the mass M through r_\mathrm{sh} =\frac{2GM}{c^2} \approx 2.95\, \frac{M}{M_\mathrm{Sun}}~\mathrm{km,} where r sh is the Schwarzschild radius and M Sun is the mass of the Sun. [ Wald 1984 124–125 ] This relation is exact only for black holes with zero charge and angular momentum; for more general black holes it can differ up to a factor of 2. [ Event horizon ] [ Event horizon ] [ Thorne Misner Wheeler 1973 848 ] File:BH-no-escape-1.svg Far away from the black hole a particle can move in any direction, as illustrated by the set of arrows. It is only restricted by the speed of light. File:BH-no-escape-2.svg Closer to the black hole spacetime starts to deform. There are more paths going towards the black hole than paths moving away. &quot; Note &quot; File:BH-no-escape-3.svg Inside of the event horizon all paths bring the particle closer to the center of the black hole. It is no longer possible for the particle to escape. The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine if such an event occurred. [ Wheeler 2007 179 ] As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass. [ Carroll 2004 Ch. 5.4 and 7.3 ] At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole. To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole. [ Carroll 2004 217 ] Due to this effect, known as gravitational time dilation, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow down as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to reach it. [ Carroll 2004 218 ] At the same time, all processes on this object slow down causing emitted light to appear redder and dimmer, an effect known as gravitational redshift. [ http://nrumiano.free.fr/Estars/int_bh.html Inside a black hole Knowing the universe and its secrets 2009-03-26 ] Eventually, at a point just before it reaches the event horizon, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen. On the other hand, an observer falling into a black hole does not notice any of these effects as he crosses the event horizon. According to his own clock, he crosses the event horizon after a finite time, although he is unable to determine exactly when he crosses it, as it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations. [ Carroll 2004 222 ] The shape of the event horizon of a black hole is always approximately spherical. [ R. Emparan H. S. Reall Black Holes in Higher Dimensions Living Reviews in Relativity 11 6 2008 http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2008-6/ 2011-02-10 0801.3471 2008LRR....11....6E ] [ Obers N. A.

[ Singularity ] [ Gravitational singularity ] At the center of a black hole as described by general relativity lies a gravitational singularity, a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite. [ Carroll 2004 205 ] For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point and for a rotating black hole, it is smeared out to form a ring singularity lying in the plane of rotation. [ Carroll 2004 264–265 ] In both cases, the singular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution. [ Carroll 2004 252 ] The singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite density. Observers falling into a Schwarzschild black hole (i.e. non-rotating and no charges) cannot avoid being carried into the singularity, once they cross the event horizon. They can prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent, but only up to a point; after attaining a certain ideal velocity, it is best to free fall the rest of the way. [ Lewis G. F. Kwan J. No Way Back: Maximizing Survival Time Below the Schwarzschild Event Horizon Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia 24 2 46–52 2007 10.1071/AS07012 0705.1029 2007PASA...24...46L ] When they reach the singularity, they are crushed to infinite density and their mass is added to the total of the black hole. Before that happens, they will have been torn apart by the growing tidal force s in a process sometimes referred to as spaghettification or the &quot; noodle effect &quot;. [ Wheeler 2007 182 ] In the case of a charged (Reissner–Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black hole, it is possible to avoid the singularity. Extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a wormhole. [ Carroll 2004 257–259 and 265–266 ] The possibility of traveling to another universe is however only theoretical, since any perturbation will destroy this possibility. [ Black holes: the inside story S. Droz W. Israel S. M. Morsink Physics World 9 1 34–37 1996 harv 1996PhyW....9...34D ] It also appears to be possible to follow closed timelike curve s (going back to one&apos;s own past) around the Kerr singularity, which lead to problems with causality like the grandfather paradox. [ Carroll 2004 266 ] It is expected that none of these peculiar effects would survive in a proper quantum mechanical treatment of rotating and charged black holes. [ Poisson E. Israel W. Internal structure of black holes Physical Review D 41 6 1796 1990 10.1103/PhysRevD.41.1796 1990PhRvD..41.1796P ] The appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as signaling the breakdown of the theory. [ Wald 1984 212 ] This breakdown, however, is expected; it occurs in a situation where quantum mechanical effects should describe these actions due to the extremely high density and therefore particle interactions. To date, it has not been possible to combine quantum and gravitational effects into a single theory. It is generally expected that a theory of quantum gravity will feature black holes without singularities.

NASA 2009-03-26 ] [ Photon sphere ] [ Photon sphere ] The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness such that photon s moving along tangent s to the sphere will be trapped in a circular orbit. For non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. The orbits are dynamically unstable, hence any small perturbation (such as a particle of infalling matter) will grow over time, either setting it on an outward trajectory escaping the black hole or on an inward spiral eventually crossing the event horizon. [ Nitta Daisuke Chiba Takeshi Sugiyama Naoshi Shadows of colliding black holes Physical Review D 84 6 September 2011 10.1103/PhysRevD.84.063008 2011PhRvD..84f3008N 1106.242 ] While light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole. Hence any light reaching an outside observer from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects inside the photon sphere but still outside of the event horizon. Other compact object s, such as neutron stars, can also have photon spheres. [ R. J. Nemiroff Visual distortions near a neutron star and black hole American Journal of Physics 61 7 619 1993 10.1119/1.17224 astro-ph/9312003 harv 1993AmJPh..61..619N ] This follows from the fact that the gravitational field of an object does not depend on its actual size, hence any object that is smaller than 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius corresponding to its mass will indeed have a photon sphere. [ Ergosphere ] [ Ergosphere ] The ergosphere is an oblate spheroid region outside of the event horizon, where objects cannot remain stationary. Rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is impossible to stand still, called the ergosphere. This is the result of a process known as frame-dragging; general relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly &quot; drag &quot; along the spacetime immediately surrounding it. Any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the direction of rotation. For a rotating black hole, this effect becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to just stand still. [ Carroll 2004 Ch. 6.6 ] The ergosphere of a black hole is bounded by the (outer) event horizon on the inside and an oblate spheroid, which coincides with the event horizon at the poles and is noticeably wider around the equator. The outer boundary is sometimes called the ergosurface. Objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere. Through the Penrose process, objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered. This energy is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole causing it to slow down. [ Carroll 2004 Ch. 6.7 ] [ Formation and evolution ] Considering the exotic nature of black holes, it may be natural to question if such bizarre objects could exist in nature or to suggest that they are merely pathological solutions to Einstein&apos;s equations. Einstein himself wrongly thought that black holes would not form, because he held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius. [ Einstein A. On A Stationary System With Spherical Symmetry Consisting of Many Gravitating Masses Annals of Mathematics 40 4 922–936 1939 10.2307/1968902 harv ] This led the general relativity community to dismiss all results to the contrary for many years. However, a minority of relativists continued to contend that black holes were physical objects, [ The Kerr and Kerr-Schild metrics R. P. Kerr The Kerr Spacetime D. L. Wiltshire M. Visser S. M. Scott Cambridge University Press 2009 978-0-521-88512-6 0706.1109 ] and by the end of the 1960s, they had persuaded the majority of researchers in the field that there is no obstacle to forming an event horizon. Once an event horizon forms, Penrose proved that a singularity will form somewhere inside it. Shortly afterwards, Hawking showed that many cosmological solutions describing the Big Bang have singularities without scalar fields or other exotic matter (see Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems ). The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical properties of black holes were simple and comprehensible, making them respectable subjects for research. [ S. W. Hawking R. Penrose The Singularities of Gravitational Collapse and Cosmology Proceedings of the Royal Society A 314 1519 529–548 January 1970 10.1098/rspa.1970.0021 harv 2416467 1970RSPSA.314..529H ] The primary formation process for black holes is expected to be the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but there are also more exotic processes that can lead to the production of black holes. [ Gravitational collapse ] [ Gravitational collapse ] Gravitational collapse occurs when an object&apos;s internal pressure is insufficient to resist the object&apos;s own gravity. For stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little &quot; fuel &quot; left to maintain its temperature through stellar nucleosynthesis, or because a star that would have been stable receives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature. In either case the star&apos;s temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under its own weight. [ Carroll 2004 Section 5.8 ] The ideal gas law explains the connection between pressure, temperature, and volume. The collapse may be stopped by the degeneracy pressure of the star&apos;s constituents, condensing the matter in an exotic denser state. The result is one of the various types of compact star. The type of compact star formed depends on the mass of the remnant—the matter left over after the outer layers have been blown away, such from a supernova explosion or by pulsations leading to a planetary nebula. Note that this mass can be substantially less than the original star—remnants exceeding 5 solar masses are produced by stars that were over 20 solar masses before the collapse. If the mass of the remnant exceeds about 3–4 solar masses (the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit )—either because the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion of matter—even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to stop the collapse. No known mechanism (except possibly quark degeneracy pressure, see quark star ) is powerful enough to stop the implosion and the object will inevitably collapse to form a black hole. The gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of stellar mass black hole s. Star formation in the early universe may have resulted in very massive stars, which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to 10 3 solar masses. These black holes could be the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of most galaxies. [ M. J. Rees M. Volonteri Massive black holes: formation and evolution Black Holes from Stars to Galaxies—Across the Range of Masses V. Karas G. Matt 51–58 Cambridge University Press 2007 978-0-521-86347-6 astro-ph/0701512 ] While most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly, an outside observer does not actually see the end of this process. Even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the reference frame of infalling matter, a distant observer sees the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon, due to gravitational time dilation. Light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the observer, with the light emitted just before the event horizon forms is delayed an infinite amount of time. Thus the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon; instead, the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly red-shifted, eventually fading away. [ Penrose R. &quot; Golden Oldie &quot; : Gravitational Collapse: The Role of General Relativity General Relativity and Gravitation 34 7 1141 2002 10.1023/A:1016578408204 2002GReGr..34.1141P ] [ Primordial black holes in the Big Bang ] Gravitational collapse requires great density. In the current epoch of the universe these high densities are only found in stars, but in the early universe shortly after the big bang densities were much greater, possibly allowing for the creation of black holes. The high density alone is not enough to allow the formation of black holes since a uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass to bunch up. In order for primordial black holes to form in such a dense medium, there must be initial density perturbations that can then grow under their own gravity. Different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the size of these perturbations. Various models predict the creation of black holes, ranging from a Planck mass to hundreds of thousands of solar masses. [ Carr B. J. Primordial Black Holes: Do They Exist and Are They Useful? H. Suzuki J. Yokoyama Y. Suto K. Sato Inflating Horizon of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology Universal Academy Press 2005 4-946443-94-0 astro-ph/0511743 ] Primordial black holes could thus account for the creation of any type of black hole. [ High-energy collisions ] A simulated event in the CMS detector, a collision in which a micro black hole may be created. Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes. In principle, black holes could be formed in high-energy collisions that achieve sufficient density. As of 2002, no such events have been detected, either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance in particle accelerator experiments. [ Giddings S. B. Thomas S. High energy colliders as black hole factories: The end of short distance physics 2002 Physical Review D 65 5 056010 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.056010 hep-ph/0106219 harv 2002PhRvD..65e6010G ] This suggests that there must be a lower limit for the mass of black holes. Theoretically, this boundary is expected to lie around the Planck mass (m P = [ ħ c / G ] ≈ [ 1.2 19 GeV/c2 ] ≈ [ 2.2 -8 kg ] ), where quantum effects are expected to invalidate the predictions of general relativity. [ Harada T. Is there a black hole minimum mass?

However, certain developments in quantum gravity suggest that the Planck mass could be much lower: some braneworld scenarios for example put the boundary as low as [ 1 TeV/c2 ]. [ Arkani–Hamed N.

Yet these theories are very speculative, and the creation of black holes in these processes is deemed unlikely by many specialists. [ http://lsag.web.cern.ch/lsag/LSAG-Report.pdf Review of the Safety of LHC Collisions LHC Safety Assessment Group CERN ] Even if micro black holes should be formed in these collisions, it is expected that they would evaporate in about 10 −25 seconds, posing no threat to the Earth.

Any black hole will continually absorb gas and interstellar dust from its direct surroundings and omnipresent cosmic background radiation. This is the primary process through which supermassive black holes seem to have grown. A similar process has been suggested for the formation of intermediate-mass black hole s in globular cluster s. [ E. Vesperini S. L. W. McMillan A. D&apos;Ercole F.

This is thought to have been important especially for the early development of supermassive black holes, which could have formed from the coagulation of many smaller objects. The process has also been proposed as the origin of some intermediate-mass black hole s. [ Zwart S. F. P. Baumgardt H. Hut P. Makino J. McMillan S. L.

By applying quantum field theory to a static black hole background, he determined that a black hole should emit particles in a perfect black body spectrum. Since Hawking&apos;s publication, many others have verified the result through various approaches. [ Page D. N. Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics New Journal of Physics 7 203 2005 hep-th/0409024 10.1088/1367-2630/7/1/203 harv 2005NJPh....7..203P ] If Hawking&apos;s theory of black hole radiation is correct, then black holes are expected to shrink and evaporate over time because they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles. The temperature of this thermal spectrum ( Hawking temperature ) is proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which, for a Schwarzschild black hole, is inversely proportional to the mass. Hence, large black holes emit less radiation than small black holes. [ Carroll 2004 Ch. 9.6 ] A stellar black hole of one solar mass has a Hawking temperature of about 100   nanokelvin s. This is far less than the 2.7  K temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Stellar mass or larger black holes receive more mass from the cosmic microwave background than they emit through Hawking radiation and thus will grow instead of shrink. To have a Hawking temperature larger than 2.7  K (and be able to evaporate), a black hole needs to have less mass than the Moon. Such a black hole would have a diameter of less than a tenth of a millimeter. [ http://www.einstein-online.info/elementary/quantum/evaporating_bh/?set_language%3Den Evaporating black holes? Einstein online Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics 2010 2010-12-12 ] If a black hole is very small the radiation effects are expected to become very strong. Even a black hole that is heavy compared to a human would evaporate in an instant. A black hole the weight of a car would have a diameter of about 10 −24  m and take a nanosecond to evaporate, during which time it would briefly have a luminosity more than 200 times that of the sun. Lower mass black holes are expected to evaporate even faster; for example, a black hole of mass 1  TeV/c 2 would take less than 10 −88 seconds to evaporate completely. For such a small black hole, quantum gravitation effects are expected to play an important role and could even—although current developments in quantum gravity do not indicate so [ Giddings S. B.

By their very nature, black holes do not directly emit any signals other than the hypothetical Hawking radiation; since the Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak, this makes it impossible to directly detect astrophysical black holes from the Earth. A possible exception to the Hawking radiation being weak is the last stage of the evaporation of light (primordial) black holes; searches for such flashes in the past has proven unsuccessful and provides stringent limits on the possibility of existence of light primordial black holes.

A black hole&apos;s existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its gravitational interactions with its surroundings. A project run by MIT&apos;s Haystack Observatory is attempting to observe the event horizon of a black hole directly. Initial results are encouraging. [ http://www.haystack.mit.edu/ast/uvlbi/mm/eht.html Event Horizon Telescope MIT Haystack Observatory 6 April 2012 ] [ Accretion of matter ] [ Accretion disc ] { accretion disk } Due to conservation of angular momentum, gas falling into the gravitational well created by a massive object will typically form a disc-like structure around the object. Friction within the disc causes angular momentum to be transported outward, allowing matter to fall further inward, releasing potential energy and increasing the temperature of the gas. [ McClintock J. E. Remillard R. A. Black Hole Binaries W. Lewin M. van der Klis Compact Stellar X-ray Sources 2006 Cambridge University Press 0-521-82659-4 astro-ph/0306213 ] { section 4.1.5. } In the case of compact object s such as white dwarf s, neutron star s, and black holes, the gas in the inner regions becomes so hot that it will emit vast amounts of radiation (mainly X-rays), which may be detected by telescopes. This process of accretion is one of the most efficient energy-producing processes known; up to 40% of the rest mass of the accreted material can be emitted in radiation. (In nuclear fusion only about 0.7% of the rest mass will be emitted as energy.) In many cases, accretion discs are accompanied by relativistic jets emitted along the poles, which carry away much of the energy. The mechanism for the creation of these jets is currently not well understood. As such many of the universe&apos;s more energetic phenomena have been attributed to the accretion of matter on black holes. In particular, active galactic nuclei and quasar s are believed to be the accretion discs of supermassive black holes. Similarly, X-ray binaries are generally accepted to be binary star systems in which one of the two stars is a compact object accreting matter from its companion. It has also been suggested that some ultraluminous X-ray source s may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black hole s. [ Winter L. M. Mushotzky R. F. Reynolds C. S. XMM‐Newton Archival Study of the Ultraluminous X‐Ray Population in Nearby Galaxies 2006 The Astrophysical Journal 649 2 730 astro-ph/0512480 10.1086/506579 harv 2006ApJ...649..730W ] [ X-ray binaries ] [ X-ray binary ] X-ray binaries are binary star systems that are luminous in the X-ray part of the spectrum. These X-ray emissions are generally thought to be caused by one of the component stars being a compact object accreting matter from the other (regular) star. The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides a unique opportunity for studying the central object and determining if it might be a black hole. Artist impression of a binary system with an accretion disk around a black hole being fed by material from the companion star. If such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object, it cannot be a black hole. The absence of such a signal does, however, not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star. By studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object. If this is much larger than the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (that is, the maximum mass a neutron star can have before collapsing) then the object cannot be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole.

Currently, better candidates for black holes are found in a class of X-ray binaries called soft X-ray transients. In this class of system the companion star is relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates in the black hole mass. Moreover, these systems are only active in X-ray for several months once every 10–50 years. During the period of low X-ray emission (called quiescence), the accretion disc is extremely faint allowing for detailed observation of the companion star during this period. One of the best such candidates is V404 Cyg. [ Quiescence and advection-dominated accretion flow ] The faintness of the accretion disc during quiescence is suspected to be caused by the flow entering a mode called an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). In this mode, almost all the energy generated by friction in the disc is swept along with the flow instead of radiated away. If this model is correct, then it forms strong qualitative evidence for the presence of an event horizon. [ Narayan R. McClintock J. Advection-dominated accretion and the black hole event horizon New Astronomy Reviews 51 10–12 733 2008 10.1016/j.newar.2008.03.002 2008NewAR..51..733N ] Because, if the object at the center of the disc had a solid surface, it would emit large amounts of radiation as the highly energetic gas hits the surface, an effect that is observed for neutron stars in a similar state. [ Quasi-periodic oscillations ] [ Quasi-periodic oscillations ] The X-ray emission from accretion disks sometimes flickers at certain frequencies. These signals are called quasi-periodic oscillations and are thought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion disk (the innermost stable circular orbit). As such their frequency is linked to the mass of the compact object. They can thus be used as an alternative way to determine the mass of potential black holes.

Theoretical and observational studies have shown that the activity in these active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be explained by the presence of supermassive black holes. The models of these AGN consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the Sun; a disk of gas and dust called an accretion disk; and two jets that are perpendicular to the accretion disk.

Preon stars: a new class of cosmic compact objects Physics Letters B 616 1–2 1 2005 10.1016/j.physletb.2005.04.034 astro-ph/0410417 2005PhLB..616....1H ] These hypothetical models could potentially explain a number of observations of stellar black hole candidates. However, it can be shown from general arguments in general relativity that any such object will have a maximum mass. Since the average density of a black hole inside its Schwarzschild radius is inversely proportional to the square of its mass, supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes (the average density of a 10 8 solar mass black hole is comparable to that of water). Consequently, the physics of matter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more mundane. For example, a supermassive black hole could be modelled by a large cluster of very dark objects. However, typically such alternatives are not stable enough to explain the supermassive black hole candidates. The evidence for stellar and supermassive black holes implies that in order for black holes not to form, general relativity must fail as a theory of gravity, perhaps due to the onset of quantum mechanical corrections. A much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not feature singularities or event horizons (and thus no black holes). [ Kiefer C. Quantum gravity: general introduction and recent developments Annalen der Physik 15 1–2 129 2006 10.1002/andp.200510175 gr-qc/0508120 2006AnP...518..129K ] In recent years, much attention has been drawn by the fuzzball model in string theory. Based on calculations in specific situations in string theory, the proposal suggest that generically the individual states of a black hole solution do not have an event horizon or singularity, but that for a classical/semi-classical observer the statistical average of such states does appear just like an ordinary black hole in general relativity. [ Skenderis K. Taylor M. The fuzzball proposal for black holes Physics Reports 467 4–5 117 2008 10.1016/j.physrep.2008.08.001 0804.0552 2008PhR...467..117S ] [ Open questions ] [ Entropy and thermodynamics ] [ Black hole thermodynamics ] { Bekenstein–Hawking entropy (S) of a black hole, which depends on the area of the black hole (A). The constants are the } { speed of light (c), the } { Boltzmann constant (k), } { Newton&apos;s constant (G), and the } { reduced Planck constant (ħ). } In 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions { In particular, he assumed that all matter satisfies the } { weak energy condition. } that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and merge. [ Hawking S. W. Gravitational Radiation from Colliding Black Holes Physical Review Letters 26 21 1344–1346 1971 10.1103/PhysRevLett.26.1344 1971PhRvL..26.1344H ] This result, now known as the second law of black hole mechanics, is remarkably similar to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of a system can never decrease. As with classical objects at absolute zero temperature, it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy. If this were the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area. [ Wald R. M. The Thermodynamics of Black Holes Living Reviews in Relativity 4 6 2001 gr-qc/9912119 http://www.livingreviews.org/lrr-2001-6 2011-02-10 1999gr.qc....12119W ] The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking&apos;s discovery that quantum field theory predicts that a black hole radiates blackbody radiation at a constant temperature. This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink. The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in Planck units is in fact always increasing. This allows the formulation of the first law of black hole mechanics as an analogue of the first law of thermodynamics, with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy. One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an extensive quantity that scales linearly with the volume of the system. This odd property led Gerard &apos;t Hooft and Leonard Susskind to propose the holographic principle, which suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume. [ G. &apos;t Hooft The Holographic Principle Basics and highlights in fundamental physics Subnuclear series 37 Zichichi A. 2001 World Scientific 978-981-02-4536-8 hep-th/0003004 ] Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as mass, charge, pressure, etc.). Without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity. In 1995, Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa showed that counting the microstates of a specific supersymmetric black hole in string theory reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. [ Strominger A. Vafa C. Microscopic origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy Physics Letters B 379 1–4 99 1996 10.1016/0370-2693(96)00345-0 hep-th/9601029 1996PhLB..379...99S ] Since then, similar results have been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity.

Classically, the laws of physics are the same run forward or in reverse ( T-symmetry ). Liouville&apos;s theorem dictates conservation of phase space volume, which can be thought of as &quot; conservation of information &quot;, so there is some problem even in classical physics. In quantum mechanics, this corresponds to a vital property called unitarity, which has to do with the conservation of probability (it can also be thought of as a conservation of quantum phase space volume as expressed by the density matrix ).
