Religion is a collection of cultural systems, belief systems, and worldviews that establishes symbols that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes, to moral values. { While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in } { religious studies courses, was proposed by } { Clifford Geertz, who simply called it a &quot; cultural system &quot; (Clifford Geertz, Religion as a Cultural System, 1973). A critique of Geertz&apos;s model by } { Talal Asad categorized religion as &quot; an } { anthropological category. &quot; (Talal Asad, The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category, 1982.) } Many religions have narratives, symbol s, tradition s and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious law s or a preferred lifestyle from their ideas about the cosmos and human nature. The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with faith or belief system, but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized behaviors, including clerical hierarchies, a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, congregation s of laity, regular meetings or services for the purposes of veneration of a deity or for prayer, holy places (either natural or architectural), and/or scripture s. The practice of a religion may also include sermon s, commemoration of the activities of a god or gods, sacrifice s, festival s, feasts, trance, initiation s, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture. Some academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories: world religions, a term which refers to transcultural, international faiths; indigenous religions, which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and new religious movements, which refers to recently developed faiths. { Harvey, Graham (2000). Indigenous Religions: A Companion. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. Page 06. } One modern academic theory of religion, social constructionism, says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the Abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings, { Vergote, Antoine, Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study, Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89 } and thus religion, as a concept, has been applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.
