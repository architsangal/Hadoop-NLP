[ http://ee.heavengames.com/new/eeh/gameinfo/epochs.shtml Empire Earth Heaven - GameInfo: Epochs HeavenGames LLC 2007-03-16 ] An expansion pack was developed by Mad Doc Software called Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest, which was released on September 17, 2002. It added new features such as a special power for each civilization, and a new 15th epoch, entitled the Space Age, which focuses on the colonization of space planets. [ http://gamespot.com/pc/strategy/empireearththeartofc/review.html GameSpot Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest review Chick, Tom 2002-09-23 GameSpot 2007-03-16 ] [ Gameplay ] Empire Earth is similar to the Age of Empires series in that it is a history-based real-time strategy game. Empire Earth uses 3D graphics instead of sprites like Age of Empires II, the comparable game at the time. The game itself contains many unique and innovative features, including a &quot; morale &quot; system, which directly affects individual units statistics. It also incorporates a &quot; hero &quot; system. Heroes can be built at the town center or capital. There are two types of heroes, Strategist heroes who heal surrounding units and can demoralize enemy units while Warrior heroes give morale to surrounding units and have a greater attack power. Finally, the player has the option of creating their own civilization with unique bonuses. Empire Earth has a map editor included. Epochs are the ages a player passes through in Empire Earth. Each of these epochs represents an age within history. In Empire Earth, the last two ages (Digital and Nano Ages) are set into the moderate future. In the Art of Conquest, a third future age, the Space Age, is available. It deals with space colonization. Each epoch brings new technologies and units. Epoch advancement requires additional buildings to be built and the costs of advancing increases as more epochs are attained, although the ability to gather the required resources greatly increases as well. With new epochs, some new units are available at the cost of having to abandon the ability to produce old units, though any old units still alive are kept. The epochs in Empire Earth are the Prehistoric Age, the Stone Age, the Copper Age, the Bronze age, the Dark Age, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Imperial age, the Industrial age, the Atomic World War I age, the Atomic World War II Age, the Atomic Modern Age, the Digital Age and the Nano Age. An extra epoch, the Space Age, is available in Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest. [ http://ee.heavengames.com/new/eeh/gameinfo/epochs.shtml Empire Earth - Epochs 2007-05-27 Empires Heaven ] In-game screenshot of Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest. Several different units are available in each epoch, each being produced in a different building. Some units such as infantry are available in every epoch and can be created at the Barracks. Other units such as archers are available from the Stone age to the Renaissance and are created at Archery Ranges. Horsemen are available from the Copper Age to the Industrial Age and are created at Stables. Siege weapons such as catapult s are produced at Siege Factories, they are available starting from the Bronze Age until the Dark Ages and are later substituted by the trebuchet in the Middle Ages throughout the Renaissance, finally being replaced by cannon s in the Imperial Age. In the Atomic Age-WW1 epoch some new buildings are made available to the player, such as Airports, Tank Factories and Naval Yards where certain planes, tank s and submarine s, etc., can be produced. In the Digital age Cyber Factories and Laboratories are available and can produce many types of mechs, which are known as Cybers in Empire Earth. [ http://ee.heavengames.com/new/eeh/gameinfo/buildings/index.shtml Empire Earth - Epochs 2007-05-27 Empires Heaven ] Like many real-time strategy games, there are technologies available to improve a player&apos;s civilization. Technologies to improve farming can be researched at the granary. Health related technologies can be researched at a hospital. Technologies researched at the hospital improve the hit points, speed, and attack of a civilization&apos;s citizens, a hospital&apos;s healing rate and range, or the population capacity. Education upgrades are found in the university, which can protect units from being converted. Economic upgrades are found in the town center or capitol. These upgrades will increase the rate at which resources are gathered.

Civilizations are predetermined in scenarios, but chosen by the player shortly after the beginning of random map games. Also, civilizations may be created by the player through the main menu or in the map editor. Each civilization has several bonuses such as increased speed or decreased cost for a type of unit. Any civilization can be played in any epoch but will only be powerful in ages that use units that it has bonuses for. In scenarios, the player receives &quot; civ points &quot; for completing various tasks. The following are the available civilizations, grouped into their recommended epochs.

The game is a basic war between all sides, unless diplomacy is involved. Until November 2008, multiplayer gameplay was played on the official Sierra servers, but these were shut down by Activision which had bought the company. However, players can still play online by connecting directly to the IP address of the game host, provided that the firewall of the host has ports 33334-33336 forwarded.

However, unlike some games, each scenario has a story to tell and the player takes part in that story. Apart from the Russian campaign, the mission, &quot; Operation Sea Lion &quot; in the German campaign, and possibly the first four scenarios in the Greek campaign, all of the battles in the campaigns have actually occurred. [ Learning campaign ] The first campaign in Empire Earth is the Learning campaign. This campaign is where players are taught how to play Empire Earth and is available in both the original game and The Art of Conquest. This campaign is divided into two parts and is not required to be played in order. The first part is about the rise of Phoenicia while the second part is about the rise of the Byzantine Empire. Detailing the military build up, walls, and other military structures such as towers. You will only be able to play as the Phoenicians in the early part of the campaign as the rest of the scenarios will be focused solely on the Byzantine Empire. [ Greek campaign ] The first real campaign focuses on Ancient Greece. The opening five scenarios (of eight scenarios total) focus on the rise of Greece. The story tells of the early Helladic people from Anatolia, the arrival of the mythical Danaans (led by King Pelops and his sons) from Egypt, the Trojan War, the rise of Athens by unifying Attica, and the first years of the Peloponnesian War. There are some fictional elements as well (such as the Trojan horse being given to the Ithaca ns by the gods). The second part is about the life of Alexander the Great. The sixth scenario is about Alexander&apos;s ascension to the Macedonian throne and de facto control of Greece by crushing the revolts of Thebes, Athens, and Sparta. The seventh scenario is about the Battle of the Granicus, Battle of Issus, and the siege of Tyre. The final scenario involves the Battle of Gaugamela, the capture of Babylon, and the battle for the Persian Gates, a mountain pass which beyond lies Persepolis, the ceremonial capital of Persia. The campaign ends when Alexander enters Persepolis with his army, manages to escape an assassination attempt while visiting the tomb of Xerxes I of Persia, and subsequently had Philotas executed for betrayal as one of the conspirators (Philotas was actually executed for knowing about the plot but failing to warn Alexander about it). [ English campaign ] The English campaign is about the struggles between England and France for superiority in Europe. The first three scenarios (of eight total) are about William I of England and his victories against Lord Toustain, the rebellion in Normandy under Guy of Burgundy (with the help of Henry I of France ) in 1047, and Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The next three scenarios take place during the Hundred Years&apos; War between England and France; Edward, the Black Prince and his raids in France are featured in the fourth and fifth scenarios. The sixth scenario is about Henry V of England &apos;s story, some parts based on William Shakespeare &apos;s play. The first part is about Henry V&apos;s efforts to suppress the Lollard Heresy while the second part sees the occupation of Harfleur and the Battle of Agincourt. The final two scenarios are led by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington with the first about his involvement against the Grande Armee during the Peninsular War at Roliça, Vimeiro, Badajoz, Talavera, Toledo, Salamanca, and Toulouse. In the second and final scenario, Wellesley finally faces off against Napoleon I of France at the battle of Waterloo. [ German campaign ] In the German campaign, the first four scenarios take place during World War I, and feature the Red Baron. The player follows Richthofen through his early days of flight and the development of his &quot; Flying Circus. &quot; The first mission involves directing Richthofen and his pilot, Count Holck, to safety after their aircraft is shot down over Poland in 1914, but in subsequent missions, Richthofen is a minor character. In the next three missions, the player protects shipments of war materials into Germany, directs German forces at the Battle of Verdun, and directs the Kaiserschlacht at the Battle of the Somme. The second part, consisting of three scenarios, deals with Nazi Germany and the first years of World War II in Europe. The first scenario introduces the Blitzkrieg, in which the player has to conquer Poland, Scandinavia, and France before an American - Soviet alliance makes it impossible. The next mission deals with the German U-boat and naval blockade of Great Britain and the Battle of Britain, which features the Bismark facing off against the Home Fleet. In the final scenario, the never-attempted Operation Sea Lion, the player commands the Luftwaffe in clearing out the southern coast of Britain and then the German forces who have been assembled to participate in the invasion of Great Britain and assigned under the leadership of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. In a surprise twist, the US 8th Fleet (led by the carrier Enterprise ) had set anchor in Bristol Channel and threatened to undermine the invasion by directly assisting in the defense of Great Britain (despite the fact that the US is still neutral and not at war with Nazi Germany). The scenario ultimately ends with the destruction of the 8th Fleet, the retreat of the British Throne to Canada, and the annexation of the British Isles to the Greater German Reich. [ Russian campaign ] In the Russian campaign, the player leads Novaya Russia, a reconstruction of the Russian Federation. The game begins in 2018, with the Russian political dissident Grigor Stoyanovich heading up a full-sized civil war from Volgograd and followed by a seizure of power in the Kremlin. The second scenario is about Grigor&apos;s conquest of the European continent where an alliance between Denmark, Norway, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly remove Novaya Russia from Moscow and assist the oppressed anti-Grigor rebels who have taken refuge in Kuybyshev. In the third scenario the now-old Grigor appoints his robotic bodyguard as his successor, crushes a coup in Moscow with help from loyalist forces, and finally succumbs to heart problems. Under Grigor II, Novaya Russia continues its conquest of the world. In a secret, deep-penetration mission during Novaya Russia&apos;s costly invasion into China, Chinese scientists were found out attempting to create a time machine. The defeat of the Chinese narrowly averts a time paradox but the destruction of the time machine had left Sergei Molotov badly contaminated with an almost lethal dose of electromagnetic radiation which necessitated the replacement of much of his body with cybernetic implants. By this time, Novaya Russia has control over much of Eurasia. In the penultimate scenario, during an attempted invasion of the Caribbean, Cuba, and the United States in 2098, General Sergei Molotov finally realizes that Grigor II has become mad when Grigor II orders Molotov via a satellite link to exterminate the whole Cuban population of more than 18 million people for their potential risk of starting an insurgency.By defecting over to the U.S. and cooperating with Special Forces agent Molly Ryan, he re-enacts the Chinese plan by retaking Cuba in a counter-offensive and building a time machine to travel back to Voronezh in 2018 to set things right.They arrive just a few minutes too late as Grigor had already left Voronezh in a potato truck.In addition, Grigor II learned about their plans and used the time machine to travel back and use the technology of the future to fortify Volgograd with a sizable detachment of cybernetic forces and other high-tech weapons. But Molotov and Ryan manage to even out Grigor II&apos;s technological advantage by sending over spies to steal the technology for themselves.A massive struggle ensues between the Government Forces and the Ushi Party which ends with the destruction of Grigor II and assassination of Grigor Stoyanovich (who proved to be unreasonable due to knowledge of Novaya Russia&apos;s military might from his successor).The campaign ends with an unanswered question: [ I can feel the tug of the time vortex...pulling me...back. But what future will I return to? One that is better, or worse? ] [ Development and release ] { Early development image of &apos;&apos;Empire Earth&apos;&apos;.
