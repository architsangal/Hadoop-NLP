[ September 2011 ] [ the language the type of cattle Gascon cattle the type of dog Gascon Saintongeois ] [ ɡasˈkuŋ ] { France Spain } { 250,000 } { Indo-European } { Italic } { Romance } { Gallo-Romance } { Occitan } { Aranese } { IPA } Gascon ( [ ɡasˈku lang ], [ ɡaskɔ̃ lang ] ) is usually considered as a dialect of Occitan, even though some specialists regularly consider it a separate language. Gascon is mostly spoken in Gascony and Béarn in southwestern France (in parts of the following French départements: Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Hautes-Pyrénées, Landes, Gers, Gironde, Lot-et-Garonne, Haute-Garonne, and Ariège ) and in the Aran Valley of Spain. It has about 250,000 speakers worldwide. [ February 2007 ] Only Aranese, a southern Gascon variety, is spoken in Spain. Aranese has been greatly influenced recently by Catalan and Spanish. Both these influences tend to differentiate it more and more from the dialects of Gascon spoken in France. Since the 2006 adoption of the new statute of Catalonia, Aranese is co-official with Catalan and Spanish in Catalonia (before, this status was valid for the Aran Valley only). [ Linguistic classification ] See Occitan: Debates concerning linguistic classification. [ Basque substrate ] The language spoken in Gascony before Roman rule was part of the Basque dialectal continuum (see Aquitanian language ); the fact that the word &apos;Gascon&apos; comes from the Latin root vasco/vasconem, which is the same root that gives us &apos;Basque&apos;, implies that the speakers identified themselves at some moment as Basque. There is a proven Basque substrate in the development of Gascon. This explains some of the major differences that exist between Gascon and other Occitan dialects. A typically Gascon feature that may arise from this substrate is the change from &quot; f &quot; to &quot; h &quot;. Where a word originally began with [ [f] ] in Latin, such as festa &apos;party/feast&apos;, this sound was weakened to aspirated [ [h] ] and then, in some areas, lost altogether; according to the substrate theory, this is due to the Basque dialects&apos; lack of an equivalent [ /f/ ] phoneme. Thus we have Gascon hèsta [ [ˈhɛsto] ] or [ [ˈɛsto] ]. A similar change took place in continental Spanish. Thus Latin facere gives Spanish hacer ([aˈθer]) (or, in some parts of southwestern Andalusia, [ [haˈθɛɾ] ] ). { A. R. Almodóvar: Abecedario andaluz&apos;&apos;, Ediciones Mágina. Barcelona, 2002 } While some linguists deny the plausibility of the Basque substrate theory, it is widely assumed that Basque, the &quot; Circumpyrenean &quot; language (as put by Basque linguist Alfonso Irigoyen and defended by Koldo Mitxelena, 1982), is the underlying language spreading around the Pyrenees onto the banks of the Garonne River, maybe as far east as the Mediterranean in Roman times (niska cited by Joan Coromines as the name of each nymph taking care of the Roman spa Arles de Tech in Rousillon, etc.).

(Ed.) 2004 Vascuence y Romance: Ebro-Garona, Un Espacio de Comunicación Gobierno de Navarra / Nafarroako Gobernua Pamplona 84-235-2506-6 250–251 ] Basque gradually eroded across Gascony in the High Middle Ages (Basques from the Val d&apos;Aran cited still circa 1000), [ Morvan, Michel 1997 Les origines linguistiques du Basque Presses Universitaires de Bordeaux (PUB) Bordeaux 978-2-86781-182-1 26 ] with vulgar Latin and Basque interacting and mingling, but eventually with the former replacing the latter north of the east and middle Pyrenees and developing into Gascon.

(Ed.) 2004 Vascuence y Romance: Ebro-Garona, Un Espacio de Comunicación Gobierno de Navarra / Nafarroako Gobernua Pamplona 84-235-2506-6 250, 255 ] Note that modern Basque has had lexical influence from Gascon in words like beira ( &quot; glass &quot; ), polit ( &quot; pretty &quot;, Gascon polit/polida) to mention but a few. One way for the introduction of Gascon influence into Basque came about through language contact in bordering areas of the Northern Basque Country, acting as adstrate. The other one takes place since the 11th century over the coastal fringe of Gipuzkoa extending from Hondarribia to San Sebastian, where Gascon was spoken up to the early 18th century and often used in formal documents until the 16th, with evidence of its occurrence in Pasaia still in the 1870s. [ http://atzoatzokoa.gipuzkoakultura.net/c78f6/ LOS GASCONES EN GUIPÚZCOA IMPRENTA DE LA DIPUTACION DE GUIPUZCOA 12 April 2009 ] { Site in Spanish } A minor focus of influence was the Way of St James and the establishment of ethnic boroughs in several towns based on the privileges bestowed on the Franc s by the Navarrese kings from the 12th until the early 14th century, while the variant spoken and used in written records is mainly Occitan of Toulouse. [ Usage of the language ] A poll conducted in Béarn in 1982 indicated that 51% of the population spoke Gascon, 70% understood it, and 85% expressed a favourable opinion regarding the protection of the language. { Ethnologue report for Gascon, 15th edition } However, use of the language has declined dramatically over recent years as Gascon is rarely transmitted to young generations any longer. The usual term for Gascon is &quot; patois &quot;, a word designating in France a non-official and devaluated dialect whatever the concerned region. [ April 2008 ] It is mainly in Béarn that the population uses concurrently the term &quot; Béarnais &quot; to designate its Gascon forms. This is because of the political past of Béarn, which was independent and then part of a sovereign state (the shrinking Kingdom of Navarre ) from 1347 to 1620. In fact, there is no unified Béarnais dialect; the language differs considerably throughout the province. Many of the differences in pronunciation can be divided into east, west, and south (the mountainous regions). For example, an &apos;a&apos; at the end of words is pronounced &quot; ah &quot; in the west, &quot; o &quot; in the east, and &quot; œ &quot; in the south. Because of Béarn&apos;s specific political past, Béarnais has been distinguished from Gascon since the 16th century, though not for linguistic reasons. [ Subdialects ] Gascon comprises three main linguistic areas: [ February 2007 ] [ February 2007 ] The &apos;Garonnais Gascon&apos; used on and next to the river Garonne valley. These regions know the least specific Gascon forms. The &apos;Southern Gascon&apos; used in the south and in the south-west of the linguistic Gascon zone. The Gascon of these regions is the one with the most distinctive characteristics of Gascon, coming mainly from a supposed Basque substratum.
