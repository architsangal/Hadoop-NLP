During the confusion that followed after the shooting, all major media outlets erroneously reported that Brady had died. Later, when ABC News anchorman Frank Reynolds, a friend of Brady&apos;s, was forced to retract the report, he angrily stated on-air to his staff, &quot; C&apos;mon, let&apos;s get it nailed down! &quot; { Stan Grossfeld. &quot; Brady&apos;s had bear of a time - Reagan aide fights back from shooting, &quot; Daily News of Los Angeles (reprinted from the Boston Globe), November 1, 1987, U.S. World section, page USW1. } – resulting in Sam Donaldson joining him after commercial. During the hours-long operation, surgeon Dr. Arthur Kobrine was informed of the media&apos;s announcement of Brady&apos;s death, to which he retorted, &quot; No one has told me and the patient. &quot; { Victor Cohn. &quot; James Brady and his odyssey, &quot; The Washington Post, November 23, 1981, page A1. } Although Brady survived, the wound left him with slurred speech and partial paralysis that required the full-time use of a wheelchair. { http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110110/ap_on_he_me/us_med_congresswoman_brain_injury } [ January 2011 ] His neurosurgeon, Arthur Kobrine, described him as having difficulty controlling his emotions while speaking after the shooting, saying &quot; he would kind of cry-talk for a while &quot;, and suffering deficits in memory and thinking, such as failing to recognize people. However, Kobrine said that 30 years later, Brady could walk and had recovered almost all speech and cognitive function.
