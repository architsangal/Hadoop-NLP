It is derived from a language called Old Gujarati (1100–1500 AD) which is the ancestor language of the modern Gujarati and Rajasthani languages. It is native to the India n state of Gujarat, where it is the chief language, and to the adjacent union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. There are about 65.5 million speakers of Gujarati worldwide, making it the 26th most spoken native language in the world. [ April 2012 ] Along with Romany and Sindhi, it is among the most western of Indo-Aryan languages. Gujarati was the first language of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the &quot; Father of the Nation of India &quot;, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the &quot; Iron Man of India. &quot; Other prominent personalities whose first language is or was Gujarati include Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Morarji Desai, Narsinh Mehta, Dhirubhai Ambani, and J.

The traditional practice is to differentiate the IA languages on the basis of three historical stages : Old IA ( Vedic and Classical Sanskrit) Middle IA (various Prakrit s and Apabhramsha s ) New IA (modern languages such as Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, etc..) Another view accords successive family, tree splits, in which Gujarati is assumed to have separated from other IA languages in four stages [ Mistry 2003 115 ] : [ Mistry 1997 654–655 ] [ Mistry 1997 655 ] IA languages split into Northern, Eastern, and Western divisions based on the innovate characteristics such as plosive s becoming voiced in the Northern (Skt. danta &quot; tooth &quot; &gt; Punj. dānd) and dental and retroflex sibilant s merging with the palatal in the Eastern (Skt. sandhya &quot; evening &quot; &gt; Beng. śājh). Western, into Central and Southern. Central, in Gujarati/ Rajasthani, Western Hindi, and Punjabi/Lahanda/Sindhi, on the basis of innovation of auxiliary verb s and postpositions in Gujarati/Rajasthani. Gujarati/Rajasthani into Gujarati and Rajasthani through development of such characteristics as auxiliary ch- and the possessive marker -n- during the 15th century. The principal changes from Sanskrit are the following : Loss of phonemic length for vowel s Change of consonant cluster s to geminate and then to single consonant s (with compensatory vowel length) [ Turner 1966 p. 811. Entry 14024. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 760. Entry 13139. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 41. Entry 941. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 766.

Sharma, Devendra Handa Aryan Books International 2005 ISBN 8173052875, ISBN 978-81-7305-287-3 227 It is an established fact that during 10th-11th century.....Interestingly the language was known as the Gujjar Bhakha.. ] [ Medieval Indian literature: an anthology, Volume 3 K. Ayyappapanicker Sahitya Akademi 1997 http://books.google.co.in/books?id%3DKYLpvaKJIMEC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA91%26amp%3Bdq 91 ] The language was used as literary language as early as 12th century.Texts of this era display characteristic Gujarati features such as direct/oblique noun forms, postpositions, and auxiliary verbs. It had 3 gender s as Gujarati does today, and by around the time of 1300 CE a fairly standardized form of this language emerged. While generally known as Old Gujarati, some scholars prefer the name of Old Western Rajasthani, based on the argument that Gujarati and Rajasthani were not yet distinct at the time. Also factoring into this preference was the belief that modern Rajasthani sporadically expressed a neuter gender, based on the incorrect conclusion that the [ũ] that came to be pronounced in some areas for masculine [o] after a nasal consonant was analogous to Gujarati&apos;s neuter [ũ]. { Smith, J.D. (2001) &quot; Rajasthani. &quot; Facts about the world&apos;s languages: An encyclopedia of the world&apos;s major languages, past and present. Ed. Jane Garry, and Carl Rubino: New England Publishing Associates. pp. 591-593. } A formal grammar of the precursor to this language was written by Jain monk and eminent scholar Hemachandra Suri in the reign of Solanki king Siddharaj Jayasinh of Anhilwara (Patan). Major works were written in various genres, for the most part in verse form, such as : rāsa, predominantly didactic narrative, of which the earliest known is Śālibhadrasūri&apos;s Bhārateśvarabāhubali (1185). phāgu, in which spring time is celebrated, of which the earliest is Jinapadmasūri&apos;s Sirithūlibadda (ca. 1335). The most famous is the Vasantavilāsa, of unknown scholarship, which is undeterminedly dated to somewhere in 14th or 15th century, or possibly earlier. bārmāsī, describing natural beauty during each of the twelve months. ākhyāna, in which different sections are each in a single metre. Narsinh Mehta (c. 1414 — 1480) is traditionally viewed as the father of modern Gujarati poetry. By virtue of its early age and good editing, an important prose work is the 14th-century commentary of Taruṇaprabha, the Ṣaḍāvaśyakabālabodhavr̥tti. { Middle Gujarati (AD 1500 — 1800), split off from Rajasthani, and developed the phonemes ɛ and ɔ, the auxiliary stem ch-, and the possessive marker -n-. } [ Mistry 2003 115–116 ] { Major phonological changes characteristic of the transition between Old and Middle Gujarati are : } i, u develop to ə in open syllable s diphthong s əi, əu change to ɛ and ɔ in initial syllables and to e and o elsewhere əũ develops to ɔ̃ in initial syllables and to ű in final syllables These developments would have grammatical consequences. For example, Old Gujarati&apos;s instrumental-locative singular in -i was leveled and eliminated, having become the same as Old Gujarati&apos;s nominative/accusative singular in -ə. Modern Gujarati (AD 1800 — ). A major phonological change was the deletion of final ə&apos;s, such that the modern language has consonant-final words. Grammatically, a new plural marker of -o developed. In literature, the third quarter of the 19th century saw a series of milestones for Gujarati, which previously had had verse as its dominant mode of literary composition. { Yashaschandra, S.

[ Demographics and distribution ] 275px { India Square in } { Jersey City, } { New Jersey, in the } { New York City Metropolitan Area, } { USA. } Of the approximately 46 million speakers of Gujarati in 1997, roughly 45.5 million resided in India, 150,000 in Uganda, 250,000 in Tanzania, 50,000 in Kenya and roughly 100,000 in Pakistan. There are now 65.5 million Gujarati speakers. [ April 2012 ] There is a large Gujarati community in Mumbai, India (2.1 million). A considerable Gujarati-speaking population, approaching one million, exists in North America, most particularly in the New York City Metropolitan Area and in the Greater Toronto Area (both of which have over 100,000 speakers), but also throughout the major metropolitan areas of the United States and Canada. The United Kingdom has 300,000 speakers, many of them situated in the London areas of Wembley, Harrow, Newham and Redbridge, and in Leicester, Coventry, Bradford and the former mill towns of Lancashire. A portion of these numbers consists of East Africa n Gujaratis who, under increasing discrimination and policies of Africanisation in their newly independent resident countries (especially Uganda, where Idi Amin expelled 50,000 Asians), were left with uncertain futures and citizenship s. Most, with British passport s, settled in the UK. [ Dwyer 1995 273 ] Indeed, due to the large Gujarati diaspora in the UK, Gujarati is offered as a GCSE subject for students in the United Kingdom. Besides being spoken by the Gujarati people, non-Gujarati residents of and migrants to the state of Gujarat also count as speakers, among them the Kutch is (as a literary language ), the Parsis (adopted as a mother tongue ), and Hindu Sindhi refugees from Pakistan. [ Official status ] Gujarati is one of the twenty-two official language s and fourteen regional language s of India. It is officially recognized in the state of Gujarat, India. [ States of India by Gujarati speakers ] [ Dialects ] { Englishmen who speak } { French. } [ Tisdall 1892 148 ] { 275px } The accepted standard dialect is the speech of the area from Baroda to Ahmedabad and north.

These are explained below. [ Hindu Gujarati ] Hindu Gujarati, which is the one adopted by the Government as the standard, is taught in schools. [ Parsi Gujarati ] Parsi Gujarati, the language as spokenand written by the Parsis. This differs from ordinaryGujarati in that it admits pure Persian words in considerable numbers, especially in connection with religiousmatters, besides a host of Arabic and other words takenfrom the Persian language, and that its grammar is in avery unfixed and irregular manner. [ Muslim Gujarati ] Like Parsi Gujarati, employs a great number of words borrowed from the Hindustani (and through it from Persian and Arabic). [ Diasporic dialects of Gujarati ] Words used by the native languages of areas where the Gujarati people have become a diaspora community, such as East Africa ( Swahili ) which they migrated to, have become loanwords in local dialects of Gujarati. { http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC &amp; pg=PA469 &amp; lpg=PA469 &amp; dq=swahili+loanwords+in+gujarati &amp; source=bl &amp; ots=SPluz9DLXf &amp; sig=uA5jRwRphlu-IxQn_ifahmzKUT4 &amp; hl=en &amp; sa=X &amp; ei=6ZBOT4OCH6PR0QWu_PHMAw &amp; ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage &amp; q= &amp; f=false } [ Closely related languages ] Kutchi, also known as Khojki, is often referred to as a dialect of Gujarati, but most linguists consider it closer to Sindhi. In addition, a mixture between Sindhi, Gujarati, and Kutchi called Memoni is related to Gujarati, albeit distantly.

It is used to write the Gujarati and Kutchi languages. It is a variant of Devanāgarī script differentiated by the loss of the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a small number of modifications in the remaining characters. Gujarati and closely related languages, including Kutchi, can be written in the Arabic or Persian script s. This is traditionally done by many in Gujarat&apos;s Kutch district. [ Vocabulary ] [ Categorisation and sources ] These are the three general categories of words in modern Indo-Aryan: tatsam, tadbhav, and loanwords. { Snell, R. (2000) Teach Yourself Beginner&apos;s Hindi Script. Hodder &amp; Stoughton. pp. 83-86. } [ Tadbhav ] તદ્ભવ્ tadbhav, &quot; of the nature of that &quot;. Gujarati is a modern Indo-Aryan language descended from Sanskrit (old Indo-Aryan), and this category pertains exactly to that: words of Sanskritic origin that have demonstratively undergone change over the ages, ending up characteristic of modern Indo-Aryan languages specifically as well as in general. Thus the &quot; that &quot; in &quot; of the nature of that &quot; refers to Sanskrit. They tend to be non-technical, everyday, crucial words; part of the spoken vernacular. Below is a table of a few Gujarati tadbhav words and their Old Indo-Aryan sources: [ Turner 1966 p. 44. Entry 992. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 203. Entry 3856. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 30. Entry 684. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 401. Entry 6969. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 502. Entry 8947. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 706. Entry 12193. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 762. Entry 13173. ] [ Turner 1966 p. 766.

While Sanskrit eventually stopped being spoken vernacularly, in that it changed into Middle Indo-Aryan, it was nonetheless standardized and retained as a literary and liturgical language for long after. This category consists of these borrowed words of (more or less) pure Sanskrit character. They serve to enrich Gujarati and modern Indo-Aryan in its formal, technical, and religious vocabulary. They are recognizable by their Sanskrit inflections and markings; they are thus often treated as a separate grammatical category unto themselves. Tatsam English Gujarati lekhak writer lakhnār vijetā winner jītnār vikǎsit developed vikǎselũ jāgǎraṇ awakening jāgvānũ Many old tatsam words have changed their meanings or have had their meanings adopted for modern times. પ્રસારણ [ prasāraṇ ] means &quot; spreading &quot;, but now it&apos;s used for &quot; broadcasting &quot;. In addition to this are neologism s, often being calque s. An example is telephone, which is Greek for &quot; far talk &quot;, translated as દુરભાષ [ durbhāṣ ]. Though most people just use ફોન phon and thus neo-Sanskrit has varying degrees of acceptance. So, while having unique tadbhav sets, modern IA languages have a common, higher tatsam pool. Also, tatsams and their derived tadbhavs can also co-exist in a language; sometimes of no consequence: dharma -dharam, other times with differences in meaning, with the former holding a &quot; higher &quot; one: Tatsam Tadbhav karma Work — Dharmic religious concept of works or deeds whose divine consequences are experienced in this life or the next. kām work [without any religious connotations]. kṣetra Field — Abstract sense, such as a field of knowledge or activity; khāngī kṣetra → private sector. Physical sense, but of higher or special importance; raṇǎkṣetra → battlefield. khetar field [in agricultural sense]. What remains are words of foreign origin (videśī), as well as words of local origin that cannot be pegged as belonging to any of the three prior categories (deśaj). The former consists mainly of Persian, Arabic, and English, with trace elements of Portuguese and Turkish. While the phenomenon of English loanword s is relatively new, Perso-Arabic has a longer history behind it. Both English and Perso-Arabic influences are quite nation-wide phenomena, in a way paralleling tatsam as a common vocabulary set or bank. What&apos;s more is how, beyond a transposition into general Indo-Aryan, the Perso-Arabic set has also been assimilated in a manner characteristic and relevant to the specific Indo-Aryan language it&apos;s being used in, bringing to mind tadbhav. [ Perso-Arabic ] India was ruled for many a century by Persian-speaking Muslims. As a consequence Indian languages were changed greatly, with the large scale entry of Persian and its many Arabic loans into the Gujarati lexicon. One fundamental adoption was Persian&apos;s conjunction &quot; that &quot;, ke. Also, while tatsam or Sanskrit is etymologically continuous to Gujarati, it is essentially of a differing grammar (or language), and that in comparison while Perso-Arabic is etymologically foreign, it has been in certain instances and to varying degrees grammatically indigenized. Owing to centuries of situation and the end of Persian education and power, (1) Perso-Arabic loans are quite unlikely to be thought of or known as loans, and (2) more importantly, these loans have often been Gujarati-ized. dāvo - claim, fāydo - benefit, natījo - result, and hamlo - attack, all carry Gujarati&apos;s masculine gender marker, o. khānũ - compartment, has the neuter ũ. Aside from easy slotting with the auxiliary karvũ, a few words have made a complete transition of verbification: kabūlvũ - to admit (fault), kharīdvũ - to buy, kharǎcvũ - to spend (money), gujarvũ - to pass. The last three are definite part and parcel. Below is a table displaying a number of these loans. Currently some of the etymologies are being referenced to an Urdu dictionary, so it should be noted that Gujarati&apos;s singular masculine o corresponds to Urdu ā, neuter ũ groups into ā as Urdu has no neuter gender, and Urdu&apos;s Persian z is not upheld in Gujarati and corresponds to j or jh. In contrast to modern Persian, the pronunciation of these loans into Gujarati and other Indo-Aryan languages, as well as that of Indian-recited Persian, seems to be in line with Persian spoken in Afghanistan and Central Asia, perhaps 500 years ago.

It (&apos;&apos;kendra&apos;&apos; in particular) would however sound quite } { pedantic and out of place. } With the end of Perso-Arabic inflow, English became the current foreign source of new vocabulary. English had and continues to have a considerable influence over Indian languages. Loanwords include new innovations and concepts, first introduced directly through British colonialism, and then streaming in on the basis of continued Anglosphere dominance in the post-colonial period. Besides the category of new ideas is the category of English words that already have Gujarati counterparts which end up replaced or existed alongside with. The major driving force behind this latter category has to be the continuing role of English in modern India as a language of education, prestige, and mobility. In this way, Indian speech can be sprinkled with English words and expressions, even switches to whole sentences. [ Masica 1991 49–50 ] See Hinglish, Code-switching. In matters of sound, English alveolar consonants map as retroflexes rather than dentals. Two new characters were created in Gujarati to represent English /æ/&apos;s and /ɔ/&apos;s. Levels of Gujarati-ization in sound vary. Some words don&apos;t go far beyond this basic transpositional rule, and sound much like their English source, while others differ in ways, one of those ways being the carrying of dentals. See Indian English. As English loanwards are a relatively new phenomenon, they adhere to English grammar, as tatsam words adhere to Sanskrit. Though that isn&apos;t to say that the most basic changes have been underway: many English words are pluralized with Gujarati o over English &quot; s &quot;. Also, with Gujarati having 3 genders, genderless English words must take one. Though often inexplicable, gender assignment may follow the same basis as it is expressed in Gujarati: vowel type, and the nature of word meaning. bâṅk bank phon phone ṭebal table bas bus rabbar eraser ṭorc flashlight dôkṭar doctor rasīd receipt helo halo hālo hello hôspiṭal aspitāl ispitāl hospital sṭeśan ṭeśan station sāykal (bi)cycle rum room āis krīm ice cream rôbaṭ robot ṭāym time aṅkal 1 uncle āṇṭī 1 aunt ie pākīṭ wallet kavar envelope noṭ banknote skūl school ṭyuśan tuition esī AC minaṭ miniṭ minute ṭikiṭ ṭikaṭ ticket sleṭ slate hoṭal hotel pārṭī party ṭren train kalekṭar collector reḍīyo radio 1 These English forms are often used (prominently by NRI s ) for those family friends and elders that aren&apos;t actually uncles and aunts but are of the age. [ Portuguese ] The smaller foothold the Portuguese had in wider India had linguistic effects. Gujarati took up a number of words, while elsewhere the influence was great enough to the extent that creole languages came to be (see Portuguese India, Portuguese-based creole languages in India and Sri Lanka ). Comparatively, the impact of Portuguese has been greater on coastal languages [ Masica 1991 49 ] and their loans tend to be closer to the Portuguese originals. [ Masica 1991 73 ] The source dialect of these loans imparts an earlier pronunciation of ch as an affricate instead of the current standard of [ʃ].

From here he gave impetus to the civil disobedience movement for breaking the salt act started on April 6 at Dandi and turned it into a nationwide movement. It was also from this place that he wrote a letter to the British viceroy expressing his firm resolve to march to the salt works at Dharasana. This is the place from where he was arrested by the British government after midnight on May 4, 1930. [ Influence on other languages ] As well as words taken by other languages, Gujarati may have exterted a large influence on Saurashtra, since it is the region of which they are named from and are speculated to have migrated from is a Gujarati speaking area; early Sinhala and Divehi speakers may have migrated from Gujarat; this is supported by a Gujarati contribution in their genetics. Gujarati also has similarities to Konkani. [ Bibliography ] [ February 2010 ] [ Dictionaries ] [ Platts J.T. 1884 A dictionary of Urdu, classical Hindi, and English London W. H.
