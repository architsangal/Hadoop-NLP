[ 9 545 #FFFF31 ] [ 5 245 #FFFF31 ] [ 150 234 #FFFF31 ] { Dr.Namathu MGR } { #226, Avvai Shanmugam Salai, Roayapettah, } { Chennai - 600014 } { 100px } Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) ( [ அண்ணா திராவிட முன்னேற்ற கழகம் ] ) is a state political party in the states of Tamil Nadu (Ruling party) and Pondicherry, India. The party was founded by M. G. Ramachandran and is now headed by J. Jayalalithaa. The party headquarters is in Royapettah, Chennai, and was gifted to the party in 1986 by its former leader Janaki Ramachandran, wife of M. G. Ramachandran. The party headed its coalition to win the Tamil Nadu assembly election 6 times to head the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly. [ MGR era ] Neduchezhiyan, Karunanidhi and MGR The party was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran (popularly known as MGR), a veteran star of the Tamil film industry and a popular politician, as a breakaway from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) led by M. Karunanidhi, the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, owing to differences between the two. { Kohli 1990, p. 157 } The party leaders intentionally prefixed &quot; All India &quot; (AI) tag before the party name, leaving no doubt about its stand on separation, when emergency (1975-77 CE) was in force. { Rana 2006, p. 400 } Relations between the two parties have been marked by mutual contempt. MGR used his fan network for building the party cadre and estimates claim his party recruited more than a million members from the first two months of creation. { Murali 2007, p. 81 } The party tasted victory in the parliamentary by elections by winning the Dindigul by-election in 1973 and also the Coimbatore assembly by-election in 1974. The government led by the DMK, was dismissed by a Central promulgation of corruption charges. The party came to power in 1977 after trouncing DMK in the next elections to the legislative assembly in the state and MGR was named the Chief Minister. He was sworn in as chief minister of the state on June 30, 1977. MGR remained in power for eleven years till his death in 1987 winning three consecutive assembly elections held in 1977, 1980 and 1984. In 1979, AIADMK became the first Dravidian and non-congress party to be part of the Union Cabinet, when two AIADMK Members of Parliament, Satyavani Muthu and Aravinda Bala Pajanor, joined the short-lived Charan Singh Ministry which followed the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party government of 1977-79. Relations between the Congress party and the AIADMK slowly became strained and the DMK got closer to the Congress Party. In the mid-term parliamentary elections of January 1980, the Congress Party aligned with the DMK and the alliance won 37 out of 39 parliamentary seats in the state; the AIADMK had just two seats. { Murali 2007, p. 82 } After returning to power, the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi &apos;s government dismissed a number of state governments belonging to the opposition parties, including Dr. M. G. Ramachandran&apos;s government. Elections to the state legislature were held in late May 1980 with the opposite DMK party continuing the electoral alliance with Congress party. Reversing the trend of Lok Sabha elections, the AIADMK won a comfortable majority in the state assembly by winning 129 seats out of 234 and MGR was sworn in as chief minister for the second time on June 9, 1980. In 1984, even with MGR&apos;s failing health and subsequent hospitalization abroad, the party managed to win the state elections in alliance with the Congress party that had improved relations with the AIADMK. Many political historians consider MGR&apos;s persona and charisma at this point of time as &quot; infallible &quot;, and a logical continuation of his on-screen &quot; good lad &quot; image, strengthened by his mythical status in the minds of the masses. { Murali 2007, p. 83 } MGR continued to enjoy popular support in his third tenure, which ended with his demise on December 24, 1987. [ Succession crisis ] MGR&apos;s wife Janaki Ramachandran subsequently rose to the party&apos;s leadership and led the government as the state&apos;s first woman chief minister until the state assembly was suspended and President&apos;s rule imposed. The party, in the absence of a personality of MGR&apos;s calibre, began to crumble, with infighting, and broke into two factions, one under Janaki Ramachandran and the other under J. Jayalalithaa, a former film star and associate of MGR. The state elections in 1989 saw DMK regaining power with Karunanidhi at the helm and the opposing Janaki and Jayalalitha factions winning 2 and 27 seats respectively. The factions led by Jayalalitha and Janaki merged in 1988 under the former&apos;s leadership. The DMK government was dismissed in 1990 by the central government led by prime minister Chandra Shekhar Singh, an ally of the AIADMK at that time, with accusations that the constitutional machinery in the state had broken down. [ J. Jayalalitha era ] ADMK head office in Chennai The AIADMK allied with Congress and swept to power in the elections of 1991 under the leadership of Jayalalitha. Many political observers have ascribed the landslide victory to the anti-incumbent wave arising out of the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by suspected Tamil separatists fighting for a homeland in neighbouring Sri Lanka. The ensuing government was accused of large-scale corruption, but Jayalalithaa managed to hold on to power for a full term of five years, after which she lost the next election to the DMK, in 1996. { Murali 2007, p. 87 } DMK&apos;s alliance with Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), headed by G.K. Moopanar and support by popular cine actor Rajinikanth also attributed to the rout of ADMK in the elections. ADMK could win only 4 seats it contested. She has been very vocal in opposing the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE, or Tamil Tigers) since then and has had a wishy-washy political association with Subramaniam Swamy. Some AIADMK cadres were accused of being behind the acid-attack on Subramaniam Swamy&apos;s acquaintance, Chandralekha, an IAS officer. The ADMK went in alliance with MDMK, the rebel party of Vaiko from the DMK during the parliamentary elections in 1998. ADMK shared power with BJP in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee headed government between 1998-1999. The ADMK could not be part of any ministry in the centre after it. The DMK held power till 2001, when the Jayalalithaa lead ADMK alliance won the 2001 election and Jayalalitha was sworn in as the chief minister on 14th May 2001. [ http://www.tn.gov.in/tnassembly/cmlist-1920.htm List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu from 1920 ] During the assembly elections in 2001, the Jayalalitha led ADMK alliance came back to power winning 132 of the 141 seats contested. { Murali 2007, p. 85 } Due to the proceedings in disproportionate assets case, she was prevented from holding office. O.Panneerselvam, was appointed as the chief minister on 21st September till Jayalalitha assumed office on 2nd March 2002. She undertook economic reforms and took many popular decisions [ February 2007 ] such as banning of lottery tickets, restricting the liquor and sand quarrying business to government agencies and banning tobacco product sales near schools and colleges. She sent a special task force to the Satyamangalam forests in October 2004 to hunt down notorious sandalwood smuggler Veerappan. The operation was successful as Veerappan was finally killed by the task force on 18 October 2004. However, in the Parliamentary elections of 2004, the party lost all their seats to the opposition coalition comprising all major opposition parties in the state. In the assembly elections of 2006, in spite of media speculations of a hung assembly, the AIADMK was pushed out of power owing to big sweep by the DMK led by M Karunanidhi. It managed to hold on to only 61 assembly seats. In the recently concluded 2011 elections, the party won by massive 146 seats making it a single largest party in the state. Jayalalitha assumed office for the 3rd term on 16th May 2011. AIADMK has spread out and has following in the states of Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh with official units. The party under the leadership of Jayalalitha floated 54 candidates across the state of Kerala in the Assembly elections of 2006 and had contested on its own. Initially AIADMK had made an alliance with Democratic Indira Congress (Karunakaran) led by the former Kerala Chief Minister K. Karunakaran, but decided to go on its own when the latter went with the Congress led United Democratic Front at the last moment, as a result of the mediation talks from the constituents of the UDF. In Karnataka the party had members in the state Assembly. AIADMK has its following in various other places like Mumbai and Delhi. There are also units in various countries where the Tamil population is spread out. Recently she made an effort to attract youths, by forming Ilaignar Pasarai. Various press articles reported that youth in her party was disappointed by her remarks. She has attacked the DMK over its role in the government&apos;s neglect of the economy, ignoring the rising cost of living and further ignoring the increase in political extremism.

The ADMK sought to depoliticize the education policy of the government by not insisting on the medium of education to be Tamil language. Policies of ADMK were targeted to the poorer segments of Tamil society - poor, rickshaw pullers, and destitute women and centralizing the massive noon meal scheme for children. There was ambivalent approach towards the reservation policy and interest of farmers. [ Criticism ] MGR, during his period did not attempt to build party organization. { Kohli 1990, p. 162 } Being a popular actor, his fan clubs became the electoral mobilization - the head of his fan club association, R.M. Veerappan became a lieutinant and fellow actress, J. Jayalilatha was groomed as a possible heir apparent. There was a near administrative collapse during the ADMK rule with the industrial dropping from 3rd position in 1977 to 13th position in 1987. There were lot of populous schemes which consumed two-thirds of the state&apos;s budget and resulted in unconscionable long-term economic costs. MGR was running a centralized administration which underwent severe toll on the state administration during his ill-health for an elongated period. { Kohli 1990, p. 163 } During the Mahamaham stampede during 1992, the Government of Tamil Nadu ADMK announced a compensation of one lakh rupees { Thol 2004, p. 14 } for the deceased, which included a sum of 30,000 rupees given by the AIADMK party that ruled the state that time. It was widely criticised by the media that a government announcement was made together with a party announcement. { Sachar 2009, p. 139 } [ Election history ] [ Tamil Nadu ] Year General Election Votes Polled Seats Won/Seats contested 1977 6th Assembly 5,194,876 132/155 1977 6th Lok Sabha 5,365,076 17 Rana 2006, p. 398 1980 7th Assembly 7,303,010 129/177 1980 7th Lok Sabha 4,674,064 2 1984 8th Assembly 8,030,809 134 1984 8th Lok Sabha 3,968,967 12 1989 9th Assembly 148,630 2 (Janaki faction) 1989 9th Assembly 27 (Jayalalitha faction) 1989 9th Lok Sabha 4,518,649 11 1991 10th Assembly 10,940,966 164/168 Murali 2007, p. 84 1991 10th Lok Sabha 4,470,542 11 1996 11th Assembly 5,831,383 4 1996 11th Lok Sabha 2,130,286 0 1998 12th Lok Sabha 6,628,928 18 Ahuja 1998, p. 358 1999 13th Lok Sabha 6,992,003 10 2001 12th Assembly 8,815,387 132 2004 14th Lok Sabha 8,547,014 0 2006 13th Assembly 10,768,559 61 2009 15th Lok Sabha 6,953,591 9 2011 14th Assembly 14,738,042 150 [ Pondicherry ] Year General Election Votes Polled Seats Won 1974 3rd Assembly 60,812 1 1977 4th Assembly 69,873 14 1977 6th Lok Sabha 115,302 1 1980 5th Assembly 45,623 20 1985 6th Assembly 47,521 6 1990 7th Assembly 76,337 30 1991 8th Assembly 67,792 6 1996 9th Assembly 57,678 3 1998 12th Lok Sabha 102,622 1 2001 10th Assembly 59,926 3 2006 11th Assembly [ Media ] Dr. Namathu MGR is a daily Tamil newspaper started on 11th July 1998. { Namathu MGR } Jaya TV network has a group of channels namely Jaya TV, Jaya Max and Jaya Plus. { Jaya network } [ Chief ministers ] Chief ministers and deputy chief ministers from ADMK are: M.
