He is best known for roles in ADV Films dubs of Neon Genesis Evangelion (as Shinji Ikari ), Martian Successor Nadesico (as Akito Tenkawa), and Excel Saga (as Shioji ). He has also performed voice acting for radio, especially commercials. His anime character voices tend to be either for timid, shy, or weak characters, or for eccentric and comical ones. He voiced Papillion in Buso Renkin, Ginta in the anime MÄR: Märchen Awakens Romance, Hanatarō Yamada in Bleach, Rolo Lamperouge in Code Geass, and has also stated he&apos;s hoping to read for Naruto. Most recently he has also starred in the animated Web series Supa Pirate Booty Hunt. He stated at Nan Desu Kan 2006 that he would like to reprise the role of Shinji in the Rebuild of Evangelion films. It was announced at Anime Boston 2009 that he would reprise his role as Shinji Ikari in the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy. He is also the voice of Takuma Ichijo in Vampire Knight &amp; Vampire Knight: Guilty. He also had a brief cameo in the Nostalgia Critic &apos;s 200th episode where he starts off chatting idly with the Critic and then leaves the room, whereupon the Critic realizes Spencer put a grenade down the Critic&apos;s pants, due to his apparent anger at the Critic&apos;s choice of movie to review ( Ponyo ). Politically, Spencer is a conservative and has posted comments on numerous websites expressing his views over the years.
