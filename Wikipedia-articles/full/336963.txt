It is an unstable colourless liquid at its melting point of -66° temperature, but it is usually handled as a dilute aqueous solution where it is used as a disinfectant. The term chloramine also refers to a family of organic compound s with the formulas R 2 NCl and RNCl 2 (R is an organic group). Dichloramine, NHCl 2, and nitrogen trichloride, NCl 3, are also well known. [ Synthesis and chemical reactions ] NH 2 Cl is a highly unstable compound in concentrated form. Pure NH 2 Cl decomposes violently above &amp; minus;40 °C. { Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. &quot; Inorganic Chemistry &quot; Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5. } NH 2 Cl is, however, quite stable in dilute solution, and this considerable stability is the basis of its applications. NH 2 Cl is prepared by the chemical reaction between ammonia and hypochlorous acid { Fair, G. M., J. C. Morris, S. L. Chang, I. Weil, and R. P. Burden. 1948. The behavior of chlorine as a water disinfectant. J. Am. Water Works Assoc. 40:1051-1061. } under mildly alkaline conditions: NH 3 + HOCl &amp; rarr; NH 2 Cl + H 2 O The synthesis is conducted in dilute solution. In this reaction HOCl undergoes attack by the nucleophile NH 3. At a lower pH, further chlorination occurs. [ Laboratory methods ] The above syntheses are useful but do not deliver NH 2 Cl in pure form. For research purposes, the pure compound can be prepared by contacting fluoroamine with calcium chloride : NH 2 F + CaCl 2 &amp; rarr; NH 2 Cl + CaClF [ Uses and chemical reactions ] NH 2 Cl is a key intermediate in the traditional synthesis of hydrazine. Monochloramine oxidizes sulfhydryls and disulfides in the same manner as HClO, { Jacangelo, J. G., V. P. Olivieri, and K. Kawata. 1987. Oxidation of sulfhydryl groups by monochloramine. Water Res. 21:1339-1344. } but only possesses 0.4% of the biocidal effect of HClO. { Morris, J. C. 1966. Future of chlorination. J. Am. Water Works Assoc. 58:1475-1482. } [ Reduction of organic chloramines ] Chloramines are often an unwanted side product of oxidation reactions of organic compounds (with amino groups) with bleach. The reduction of chloramines back into amines can be carried out through a mild hydride donor. Sodium borohydride will reduce chloramines, but this reaction is greatly sped up with acid catalysis. [ Uses in water treatment ] [ Chloramination ] NH 2 Cl is commonly used in low concentration s as a secondary disinfectant in municipal water distribution system s as an alternative to chlorination. This application is increasing. Chlorine (sometimes referred to as free chlorine) is being displaced by chloramine, which is much more stable and does not dissipate from the water before it reaches consumers. NH 2 Cl also has a very much lower, however still present, tendency than free chlorine to convert organic materials into chlorocarbon s such as chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Such compounds have been identified as carcinogen s and in 1979 the United States Environmental Protection Agency‎ began regulating their levels in U.S. drinking water. Furthermore, water treated with chloramine lacks the distinct chlorine odour of the gaseous treatment and so has improved taste. In swimming pools, chloramines are formed by the reaction of free chlorine with organic substances. Chloramines, compared to free chlorine, are both less effective as a sanitizer and more irritating to the eyes of swimmers. When swimmers complain of eye irritation from &quot; too much chlorine &quot; in a pool, the problem is typically a high level of chloramines. [ April 2009 ] Pool test kits designed for use by homeowners are sensitive to both free chlorine and chloramines, which can be misleading. [ April 2009 ] New swimming pool initially filled with chloramine-treated tap water. Chloramine-treated water has a greenish cast; the source of the colour is uncertain. Pure water by contrast normally is blue. This greenish color may be observed by filling a white polyethylene bucket with chloraminated tap water and comparing it to chloramine-free water such as distilled water or a sample from a swimming pool. [ Health risks ] Adding chloramine to the water supply can increase exposure to lead in drinking water, especially in areas with older housing; this exposure can result in increased lead levels in the bloodstream and can pose a significant health risk. { Marie Lynn Miranda et. al, &quot; Changes in Blood Lead Levels Associated with Use of Chloramines in Water Treatment Systems &quot;, &apos;&apos;Environ Health Perspect.&apos;&apos;, 2007 February; 115(2): 221–225. } There is also evidence that exposure to chloramine can contribute to respiratory problems, including asthma, among swimmers. { Bougault, Valérie, et. al, &quot; The Respiratory Health of Swimmers &quot;, &apos;&apos;Sports Medicine&apos;&apos;, Vol. 39, No. 4, 2009, pp. 295-312(18). } Respiratory problems related to chloramine exposure are common and prevalent among competitive swimmers. { &quot; The determinants of prevalence of health complaints among young competitive swimmers &quot;, &apos;&apos;International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health&apos;&apos;, Vol. 80, No. 1, Oct. 2006. } Chloramine use, together with chlorine dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet, have been described as public health concerns and an example of the outcome of poorly implemented environmental regulation. [ 2011 March 2011 ] These methods of disinfection decrease the formation of regulated byproducts such as alkyl chloroforms, which has led to their widespread adoption. However, they can increase the formation of a number of less regulated cytotoxic and genotoxic byproducts, some of which pose greater health risks than the regulated chemicals, { Stuart W. Krasner, &quot; The formation and control of emerging disinfection by-products of health concern &quot;. &apos;&apos;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A&apos;&apos;, Oct. 13, 2009, 367:4077-4095. } causing such diseases as cancer, kidney disease, thyroid damage, { By Dr. Winn Parker, &quot; Chloramine Causes Collateral Health Damage &quot; } and birth defects. { Choramine Info Center &quot; What is Chloramine &quot; } [ Removing chloramine from water ] Chloramine can be removed from tap water by treatment with superchlorination (10 ppm or more of free chlorine, such as from a dose of sodium hypochlorite bleach or pool sanitizer) while maintaining a pH of about 7 (such as from a dose of hydrochloric acid). Hypochlorous acid from the free chlorine strips the ammonia from the chloramine, and the ammonia outgasses from the surface of the bulk water. This process takes about 24 hours for normal tap water concentrations of a few ppm of chloramine. Residual free chlorine can then be removed by exposure to bright sunlight for about 4 hours. Boiling the water for 20 minutes will remove chloramine and ammonia. Additionally, many foods and drinks rapidly neutralize chloramine without the necessity of boiling (e.g., tea, coffee, chicken stock, orange juice, etc.). SFPUC determined that 1000 mg of Vitamin C (tablets purchased in a grocery store, crushed and mixed in with the bath water) remove chloramine completely in a medium size bathtub without significantly depressing pH. Shower attachments containing Vitamin C can be purchased on the Internet, as well as effervescent Vitamin C bath tablets. [ QUESTIONS REGARDING CHLORINE AND CHLORAMINE REMOVAL FROM WATER http://www.sfwater.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid%3D957 San Francisco Public Utilities Commission 19 April 2012 ] [ Situations where monochloramine is removed from water supplies ] Many animals are sensitive to chloramine and it must be removed from water given to many animals in zoos. Aquarium owners remove the chloramine from their tap water because it is toxic to fish. Aging the water for a few days removes chlorine but not the more stable chloramine, which can be neutralised using products available at pet stores. Chloramine must also be removed from the water prior to use in kidney dialysis machines, as it would come in contact with the bloodstream across a permeable membrane. However, since chloramine is neutralized by the digestive process, kidney dialysis patients can still safely drink chloramine-treated water. Home brewers use reducing agents such as sodium metabisulfite or potassium metabisulfite to remove chloramine from brewing fermented beverages. Chloramine, like chlorine, can be removed by boiling. However the boiling time required to remove the chloramine is much longer than that of chlorine. { &quot; Experiments in Removing Chlorine and Chloramine From Brewing Water &quot; } Residual sodium can cause off flavors in beer (See Brewing, Michael Lewis) so potassium metabisulfite is preferred. Chloramine can be removed from bathwater and birthing tubs by adding 1000  mg of vitamin C (as the ascorbic acid form) to a medium size bathtub (about 40 gallons of water). { San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, &quot; Questions Regarding Chlorine and Chloramine Removal From Water (Updated August 2010) &quot; } [ Organic chloramines ] A variety of organic chloramines are known and proven useful in organic synthesis. One example is N-chloromorpholine ClN(CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 O, N-chloro piperidine, and N-chloro quinuclidinium chloride. { Lindsay Smith, J. R.; McKeer, L. C.; Taylor, J. M. &quot; 4-Chlorination of Electron-Rich Benzenoid Compounds: 2,4-Dichloromethoxybenzene &quot; Organic Syntheses, CollectedVolume 8, p.167 (1993)..http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV8P0167.pdf describes several N-chloramines } [ Safety ] US EPA regulations limit chloramine concentration to 4 parts per million (ppm). A typical target level in US public water supplies is 3 ppm. In order to meet EPA regulated limits on halogenated disinfection by-product s, many utilities are switching from chlorination to chloramination. While chloramination produces fewer total halogenated disinfection by-products, it produces greater concentrations of unregulated iodinated disinfection by-products and &apos;&apos;N&apos;&apos;-nitrosodimethylamine.
