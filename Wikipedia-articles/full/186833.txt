Raised Roman Catholic, Braun said she became a born-again Christian in 1986—the year she got divorced, her mother suffered a stroke, a younger brother died of drug abuse and Chicago Mayor Harold Washington blocked her bid for lieutenant governor. } Carol Elizabeth Moseley Braun (born August 16, 1947) is an American feminist politician and lawyer who represented Illinois in the United States Senate from 1993 to 1999. She was the first and to date only African-American woman elected to the United States Senate, the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator in an election, and the first and to date only female Senator from Illinois. From 1999 until 2001, she was the United States Ambassador to New Zealand. She was a candidate for the Democratic nomination during the 2004 U.S. presidential election. Following the public announcement by Richard M. Daley that he would not seek re-election, in November 2010, Braun began her campaign for Mayor of Chicago.

[ Professional career ] As an attorney, Moseley Braun was a prosecutor in the United States Attorney &apos;s office in Chicago from 1973 to 1977. An Assistant United States Attorney, she worked primarily in the civil and appellate law areas.

Retrieved January 4, 2011 } [ Early political career ] Moseley Braun was first elected to public office in 1978, as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives. There, she rose to the post of assistant majority leader. As a State Representative, she became recognized as a champion for liberal social causes. As early as 1984, she proposed a moratorium on the application in Illinois of the death penalty. And in what became a landmark reapportionment case, Crosby vs State Board of Elections, she successfully sued her own party and the state of Illinois on behalf of African American and Hispanic citizens. When she left the state legislature in 1987, her colleagues recognized her in a resolution as &quot; the conscience of the House. &quot; [ Carol Moseley-braun http://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/carol-moseley-braun/ National Women&apos;s History Museum 21 November 2010 ] That same year, she was elected as Cook County, Illinois, Recorder of Deeds, a post she held for four years. [ U.S. Senate ] [ Elections ] U.S. Senator Moseley Braun In 1991, angered by incumbent Democratic senator Alan Dixon &apos;s vote to confirm Clarence Thomas, Moseley Braun challenged him in the primary election. Candidate Albert Hofeld &apos;s campaign ran many anti-Dixon ads, and Moseley Braun won the primary, ultimately defeating Richard S. Williamson in the Senate election. On November 3, 1992, she became the first African American woman to be elected to the United States Senate. Her election marked the first time Illinois had elected a woman, and the second time a black person was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate. She (along with Edward Brooke ) was one of two African-Americans to serve in the Senate in the 20th century, and was the sole African-American in the Senate for her entire term. Carol Moseley Braun was a one-term Senator, losing to Republican Peter Fitzgerald in her re-election bid in 1998. { Patty Murray (D-WA), Sen. } { Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Sen. } { Barbara Boxer (D-CA) Bottom Row: Sen. Carol Moseley Braun (D-IL), Sen. } { Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) } [ Positions ] Despite her reputation as a liberal, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially current Majority Leader Harry Reid. On social issues however, she was significantly more liberal than many of her fellow senators. She was strongly pro-choice, voting against the ban on partial-birth abortions and the restrictions on funding in military bases for abortions. She also voted against the death penalty and in favor of gun control measures. Moseley Braun was one of only sixteen senators to vote against the Communications Decency Act and one of only fourteen to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act. She delivered a eulogy to Thurgood Marshall on January 26, 1993. In 1993, the Illinois Senator made headlines when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy because it contained the Confederate flag. The patent had been routinely renewed for nearly a century, and despite the Judiciary Committee’s disapproval, the Senate was poised to pass a resolution sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that included a provision to authorize the extension of the federal patent. Moseley-Braun threatened to filibuster the legislation “until this room freezes over.” She also made an impassioned and eloquent plea to her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, “It has no place in our modern times, place in this body, place in our society.” Swayed by Moseley-Braun’s argument, the Senate rejected the UDC’s application to renew its patent. { http://baic.house.gov/member-profiles/profile.html?intID=59 } [ Controversy ] Moseley Braun was the subject of a 1993 Federal Elections Commission investigation over $249,000 in unaccounted-for campaign funds. The agency found some small violations, but took no action against Moseley Braun, citing a lack of resources. Moseley Braun only admitted to bookkeeping errors. The Justice Department turned down two requests for investigations from the IRS. { Slate, Is Carol Moseley-Braun a Crook? &quot;, 19 Feb 2003 } In 1996, Moseley Braun made a private trip to Nigeria, where she met with dictator Sani Abacha. Despite U.S. sanctions against that country due to Abacha&apos;s actions, the Senator did not notify, nor register her trip with, the State Department. She subsequently defended Abacha&apos;s human rights records in Congress. { NPR, &quot; 2004 Democratic Presidential Candidates: Carol Moseley Braun &quot;, 6 May 2003 } Her former fiancé Kgosie Matthews, who also served on her campaign staff (in violation of U.S. immigration regulations { Siskind Susser Bland. &quot; US SENATOR’S CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOUND TO BE WORKING ILLEGALLY. &quot; May 1998.
