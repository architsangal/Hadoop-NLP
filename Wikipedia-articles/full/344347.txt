[ History ] Scituate was settled by a group of people from Plymouth about 1627, who were joined by immigrants from the county of Kent in England. They were initially governed by the General Court of Plymouth, but on October 5, 1636, the town incorporated as a separate entity. The name Scituate is derived from satuit, the Wampanoag term for cold brook, which refers to a brook that runs to the inner harbor of the town. In 1710 several residents emigrated to Rhode Island and founded Scituate, Rhode Island, naming it after their previous hometown. Twelve homes and a sawmill were destroyed in King Philip&apos;s War in 1676.

In 1849 another western section became the town of South Scituate, which later changed its name to Norwell. Since then, the borders have remained essentially unchanged. Fishing was a significant part of the local economy in the past, as well as the sea mossing industry. A small fishing fleet is still based in Scituate Harbor, although today the town is mostly residential. In 1810, a lighthouse was erected on the northern edge of Scituate Harbor. This lighthouse is now known as Old Scituate Light. During the War of 1812, a British naval raiding party was deterred by the two daughters of the lighthouse keeper playing a fife and drum loudly. The girls and this incident became known as the &quot; American Army of Two &quot; or &quot; Lighthouse Army of Two &quot;. Another notable lighthouse, Minot&apos;s Ledge Light, stands approximately one mile off Scituate Neck. Samuel Woodworth &apos;s Old Oaken Bucket house is located in Scituate. The town is also home to the Lawson Tower, a water tower surrounded by a wooden façade, with an observation deck with views of most of the South Shore from the top. Scituate used to be the site of international broadcasting radio station WNYW, which broadcast on the shortwave bands in the late 1960s. [ Geography ] Scituate Lighthouse, Scituate Harbor According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 82.4 sqkm flip ], of which [ 45.7 sqkm flip ] is land and [ 36.8 sqkm flip ], or 44.60%, is water.

The town is [ 19 mi ] northeast of Brockton and [ 25 mi ] southeast of Boston. Scituate is considered a South Shore community, located just south of the mouth of greater Boston Harbor. The town is not contiguous; Humarock is a part of Scituate which can only be reached from Marshfield. The latter was formerly connected to the town, but that connection was lost when the mouth of the South River shifted northward as the result of the Portland Gale of 1898. The town&apos;s shore varies, with the south (along the mouth of the North River) being surrounded by salt marshes, the middle (around Scituate Harbor) being sandy, and the coast of Scituate Neck (Minot) in the north exhibiting exposed granite bedrock. It is off these rocks that Minot&apos;s Ledge lies, home to the town&apos;s most famous lighthouse. The inland of the town is mostly wooded, with several brooks and rivers (including Satuit or &quot; Cold Brook &quot;, for which the town is named) running through. The town has no freeways running through it; Massachusetts Route 3 runs through neighboring Norwell. Route 3A runs through the town, and is known as Chief Justice Cushing Highway for this stretch, named for Chief Justice William Cushing (1732–1810). The only other state highway in town is Route 123, which terminates at Route 3A, just [ 0.7 mi km ] from the town line. There is no air service in town; the closest regional airport is Marshfield Municipal Airport, and the closest national and international air service is at Logan International Airport in Boston. There are two MBTA commuter rail stations. One is just off Route 3A in North Scituate, and the other is just east of the intersection of Routes 3A and 123 in the Greenbush neighborhood, which is the line&apos;s eastern terminus. The line is connected to an existing line in Braintree, providing service to South Station in Boston. { MBTA CBB Greenbush Construction Project website } Named places in the town include: { CIS: Unincorporated and Unofficial Names of Massachusetts Communities } Egypt First Cliff Greenbush (Green Bush) Hatherly Humarock Lawson Tower, a historic water tower which is visible from several miles out at sea Minot, including Minot Beach North Scituate (formerly Gannett Corner) { Thomas Doughty, 1837 } Peggotty Beach Rivermoor Second Cliff Shore Acres Sodham The Glades Sand Hills The Connolly House Third Cliff &quot; The Harbor &quot; refers to the business district as well as the harbor itself.
