Amongst the rest of the family, Harriette, Rachel, and &quot; Mother &quot; Estelle Winslow are more accepting and caring of Urkel. Throughout the series&apos; run, Steve is central to many of its recurring gags, primarily gratuitous property damage and/or personal injury as a result of his inventions going awry or his outright clumsiness. [ TELEVISION: YES, URKEL STILL LIVES Time 1991-04-01 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C972641%2C00.html 2010-08-21 ] He becomes known for several catchphrase s uttered after some humorous misfortune occurred, including &quot; I&apos;ve fallen and I can&apos;t get up! &quot; after he accidentally got drunk in one episode and fell off the edge of a building, &quot; Did I do that? &quot; (previously used by Curly in the 1934 Three Stooges short Punch Drunks ), &quot; Whoa, Mama! &quot; and &quot; Look what you did &quot; (if, rarely, someone else caused the damage). Additionally, he frequently insinuates &quot; You love me, don&apos;t you? &quot; to Laura Winslow, the usual object of his affection. [ Character development ] Steve Urkel first appeared on the tenth episode of the first season, &quot; Laura&apos;s First Date &quot;, as a nerdy young boy who took the character of Laura Winslow out on a date, where he appeared as being madly in love with her, but in an example of unrequited love, Laura did not return these feelings because of Steve&apos;s nerdy, infuriating personality. Although intended to only appear once, White&apos;s portrayal was very popular for his humorous, geeky antics. After appearing on other episodes, he joined the main cast. [ pool19920204 ] All throughout the course of the series, Steve maintains his extreme infatuation with Laura and regularly invites himself over for unwanted visits to her house, much to the annoyance of the Winslows. Among Steve&apos;s other famed character traits include his exceptional scientific skills, crafting devices that would be impossible to construct in reality, and his kind heart. [ Name ] Family Matters co-creator Michael Warren named the character after his friend, writer and director Steve Erkel. Due to the show and the character&apos;s great popularity during the early 1990s, Erkel encountered difficulties using his own name; he received many prank phone call s from &quot; Laura &quot; asking for &quot; Steve &quot;, and businesses found his name suspicious. Warren stated that he he known that the character would reappear for years he would not have named him after his friend. [ http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-04/entertainment/ca-1196_1_family-matters Will the Real Steve Please Stand Up? Los Angeles Times 1992-02-04 May 26, 2012 Pool, Bob ] [ Family ] The Urkels are very intelligent people; Steve and his family were known to do the Sunday crossword puzzles in pen in about 20 minutes. In fact, Steve himself was known for considering his teachers and school officials as equals, calling them by their given names instead of Mr., Mrs., or Ms. He is also fluent in Japanese and Korean which he sometimes uses to speak to Principal Shimata, Vanderbilt High School&apos;s Japanese-American principal. However, on many occasions, it is said or referenced that Steve&apos;s parents have nothing but total contempt for him, and do their best to avoid him at all times. For example, when he was born his parents tried to push him back in, and his parents do not own a car because he was born in one. He also once mentioned that his parents do not feed him every day. This perhaps explains why he spends his time at the Winslows and not at his own home. However, when Steve was Stefan in Season 5&apos;s episode &quot; Dr. Urkel and Mr. Cool &quot;, they started to show their love for him and introduced him to his relatives. It may be assumed that his parents, although nerds, are very shallow people and prefer Stefan&apos;s company rather than Steve&apos;s. The viewers see that Steve has at least four relatives who do care about him. In an early episode, entitled &quot; The Big Fix – AKA Mercy Date, &quot; his uncle Ernie, drives him on his date with Laura, and takes a picture. He also has a good relationship with his &quot; Aunt Oona from Altoona &quot; (notably played by Donna Summer ). She also visits Steve in two episodes and is a mother figure to him aside Estelle. He also mentions his Uncle Cecil throughout the series, so it implies that Uncle Cecil cares for Steve, who has a police record. His cousin, Myrtle is very close to him and treats him like her brother. Other relatives included Myrtle&apos;s father &quot; Big Daddy &quot; (played by Reginald VelJohnson in a dual role) who did not think Eddie was a good choice for his daughter except when bribed with cash. It was mentioned in Season 2 that Big Daddy and the other relatives (excluding Oona, Cecil, Ernie and Myrtle) pay Steve a lot of money not to visit them. However, they tolerated him after he got a makeover and was less clumsy. Steve has a gangster cousin from Detroit named Cornelius Eugene Urkel (also played by White) who went by the moniker &quot; Original Gangsta Dawg &quot;. He tries to avoid him at all costs. Steve also has another cousin named Julie, that&apos;s D.J.&apos;s friend and lives in San Francisco. In his first episode, &quot; Laura&apos;s First Date &quot;, Steve&apos;s father is mentioned in the line: &quot; Did I mention my dad knows Wayne Newton ? &quot; It was also once mentioned that his uncle Ernie owns a hearse. In 1995, his parents moved to Russia without Steve, because he did not want to go, apparently abandoning him. Steve was then allowed to live with the Winslows; however, in a 1997 episode, a subplot has Steve visiting his parents. In addition to his parents, his family also included his cousin, Myrtle Urkel, whose innocent infatuation with Laura&apos;s brother, Eddie, was equal to Steve&apos;s for Laura. However, Eddie never grew to like Myrtle unlike Laura who did grow to like Steve (thanks in some part to Myra demanding his undivided attention to her). At the end, when Myrtle realized that she is acting like a prostitute (due to shopping and a makeover with Laura and Maxine), she abandoned him, to pursue some other man. That was the last time Myrtle appeared. The Urkel family, along with Steve, have very good luck in gambling; Eddie once broke Carl&apos;s car and needed $800 to pay for the damage without Carl noticing, but he couldn&apos;t afford it, so he and Steve went to a illegal gambling casino with fictional Mom&apos;s bakery as a cover-up store for protection. Steve focused and managed to win $32,000, but when they prepared to leave, a police called in a raid so he and Eddie ended up in prison until Carl paid a ransom for them. Steve had a pen-pal, a girl, who was in prison, but he stopped writing her because she went out of jail and tried to seduce Carl, because she thought that Carl was Steve. After a big misunderstanding, she was brought back to prison. [ Stefan Urquelle ] During the fifth season episode &quot; Dr. Urkel and Mr. Cool, &quot; Urkel devised the ultimate plan to win Laura&apos;s heart: transforming his DNA using a serum called &quot; Cool Juice &quot; to suppress his &quot; nerd &quot; gene s and bring out his &quot; cool &quot; genes. This resulted in the alter ego known as Stefan Urquelle, played by White in more casual attire and with a smoother delivery. Initially, Laura is enamored with Stefan, but asks that he turn back into Steve when Stefan&apos;s self-centered, narcissistic attitude comes out. Steve later improved the formula to limit the effects it had on his new personality, and re-dubbed the formula &quot; Boss Sauce. &quot; He also invented a &quot; transformation chamber, &quot; which allowed him to turn into Stefan for extended periods of time (as well as avoiding developing rashes in &quot; personal areas &quot; ). He changed into Stefan several times—even while dating Myra—but some circumstance caused him to change back into Steve each time. In the Season 6 two parter episode: To Be or Not To Be, Steve was stuck as Stefan for a while, after Carl was accidentally transformed into Carl Urkel, due to Myra&apos;s tampering with the transformation chamber to sabotage it and preventing Stefan. Late in the sixth season, Steve transformed into Stefan as part of an inventors competition at Walt Disney World; however, Laura sabotaged the transformation chamber to prevent him from turning back into Steve. During his extended stint as Stefan, he proposed to Laura in front of Cinderella Castle. Laura accepted, but their engagement was broken off when Myra appealed to Stefan and Laura revealed her sabotage. While everyone liked Stefan, Myra disliked him immensely, believing he was a joke to her and thought her &quot; Steviekins &quot; is perfect the way he is. In the seventh season finale &quot; Send in the Clones &quot;, Steve created a cloning machine. He came to believe it did not work though it did create another Steve. To clear up the situation, Laura proposed that one of the Steves be turned into the suave Stefan. The permanent Stefan made several more appearances throughout the series and proposed to Laura again before the series finale. After weighing her choices in the flashback episode &quot; Pop Goes the Question, &quot; Laura chose Steve over Stefan. He left and never reappeared again. It could be assumed that Stefan accepted their relationship and moved on with his life, after he learned from his mistake in the episode &quot; Crazy For You &quot; when he teamed up with Myra to stop their date. [ Relationships ] Steve was always in love with Laura since the 7th grade. However, she didn&apos;t always reciprocate the same feelings that he had for her and would date other guys more to her taste. Unlike Greta&apos;s successful warding of Myrtle, Laura&apos;s would-be boyfriends would often bully Steve, but it always ends with him warding them off. Especially when he knows most of them would end up hurting her in the end and refused to allow them to take advantage of her. Steve has shown that unlike Myrtle, he does respect Laura&apos;s personal space. However, she has shown appreciation to Steve when he selflessly risked himself to not only protect her, but also has saved her father&apos;s life. By season 9, he finally gets himself a makeover in time for Laura&apos;s auction and though he wasn&apos;t a success, her feelings for him finally changed and are engaged to be married. Steve had a short and brief relationship with Susie in season 2, but their relationship ended when he introduced her to the president of the chess club. In Season 3, he also had Vonda Mahoney interested in him after he tutored her for a class. Fearing that she wants to make herself &quot; easy &quot; for Eddie to date, Steve teaches her the dangers of it and helps her have love and self-respect for herself. Although Vonda felt better about herself, this didn&apos;t settle in well with Eddie who wanted to pound Steve for it. In Season 4&apos;s &quot; A Thought In The Dark &quot;, Steve was set up and introduced to Ted&apos;s cousin, Myra Monkhouse, so Laura can have some space from his infatuation. Although he was initially attracted to Myra because of her intelligence and sweet personality, he was soon disgusted by her jealous and possessive nature by the end of &quot; Buds &apos;N Buns &quot;. This was explored in both seasons 5 and 9 when Steve finally saw what life was like in Laura&apos;s shoes when he pursued her relentlessly. Though in love with him, Myra was also frustrated with Steve and asked him why he even loves Laura. When he agree to date her for a while in season 6&apos;s &quot; Paradise Bluffs &quot;, she did somewhat revert back to the sweet, intelligent girl he was originally attracted to. By Season 9, he grows apart from her when Laura started returning her feelings for him. In &quot; Breaking Up Is Hard To Do during their date at Amore, it became clear to Steve that Myra hated his makeover and demanded that he return to the sexy nerd she loved so much. When he refused, she broke up with him first, although it later turned out to be a ploy so she can get him to renounce his love for Laura and stay with her. When that failed, Myra resorted to stalking and spying on him with illegal surveillance gear in her room with a spy cam attached to his glasses. In &quot; Crazy For You &quot; she teamed up with Stefan to stop Steve and Laura&apos;s date. Although initially successful, Laura still wanted to date him and Myra vowed never to stop stalking him until he took her back. In &quot; Crazier For You &quot;, Steve has learned that she was stalking him with illegal spy gear and confronted her about it. He orders Myra to stop stalking him and renounce her love for him because he will never take her back and reaffirms his love for Laura. She refused and got Laura falsely arrested for stealing her watch. However, Steve was able to drop the charges when he exposed Myra for stalking him with illegal spy gear and the police pursued criminal charges against her. When she learned of his engagement to Laura, she continued to carry the torch even when he went into space. [ Ratings effect ] In syndication Steve is in the pre-credits introductory scene of &quot; Rachel&apos;s First Date &quot;, but his first appearance in first run episodes is in the 1989 episode &quot; Laura&apos;s First Date &quot;, where Carl and Eddie separately set up dates for Laura for a dance or party (both terms used), and the first thing known about him is that he allegedly ate a mouse, and he later makes reference to a mouse when speaking to Carl, implying that it might be true. Prior to Urkel, the show was on the brink of cancellation due to low ratings. After Urkel was introduced, several scripts had to be hastily re-written to accommodate the Steve character, while several first-season episodes that had been completed had new opening gag sequences filmed featuring Steve trying to push open the Winslows&apos; front door while the family holds it shut. The addition of Steve immediately helped the show boost its modest ratings. White was credited as a guest star in the first season and became a regular member of the cast in season two. [ The Urkel Dance ] The Urkel Dance was a novelty dance that originated in the episode &quot; Life of the Party &quot;. It was based around the character of Steve Urkel and essentially incorporated movements which made the dancer&apos;s posture more like his. The lyrics instructed the dancer how to pose: &quot; If you want to do the Steve Urkel dance, All you have to do is hitch up your pants, Bend your knees, and stick out your pelvis; (I&apos;m telling you, baby, it&apos;s better than Elvis!) &quot;. It was popular enough to appear on another show, Step by Step.Jaleel White also performed the song, in character as Steve Urkel, on the 5th Annual American Comedy Awards. Bea Arthur joined him on stage to &quot; Do The Urkel, { Do The Urkel(.com) - The Website } &quot; after which she said, &quot; Hey MC Hammer, try and touch that! &quot; { The House of Diabolique vs. Bea Arthur &amp; Urkel } A promotional cassette single of the song that accompanies the dance was pressed and distributed in limited numbers. A t-shirt was also produced featuring lyrics and Urkel&apos;s likeness. [ Appearances on other shows ] Full House – In the 1991 episode, &quot; Stephanie Gets Framed &quot;, Steve is called in to help Stephanie Tanner ( Jodie Sweetin ) deal with her anxieties after she has to get glasses. He was cousin to a friend of D. J.. In the original airing, this episode appeared right after a Family Matters episode where Steve uses a jet pack to rocket through the Winslow&apos;s roof and into the air away from Chicago, implying that he landed in San Francisco into the Full House universe. Step by Step – In the series&apos; second episode, &quot; The Dance &quot;, Steve lands in the Step by Step family&apos;s back yard after launching himself with a rocket pack from the living room of the Winslows&apos; house on Family Matters (the two scenes being shown in uninterrupted sequence, as Family Matters and Step by Step aired back to back on television at the time). He then helps his science-fair pen pal, Mark Foster, and lifts Alicia &quot; Al &quot; Lambert ( Christine Lakin &apos;s) spirits after her potential date dumps her just before a school dance. White reprises his &quot; Do the Urkel &quot; dance in the scene where Al gives the boy that dumped her his comeuppance. Also, Steve makes a brief appearance in the episode where Al gets the movie role over her two sisters. He can be seen for 2 seconds snapping a clapboard during the music video part. Meego - In this short-lived series, Steve makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the second episode &quot; Love and Money &quot; where he angrily retrieves a television set stolen by Meego. He then appears in the third episode &quot; The Truth About Cats and Dogs &quot; helping out at a model car derby competition. Additionally, Steve once received a chain letter and thought he&apos;d send it on to his pen friend Cory Matthews who lived in Philadelphia. The reference is to Ben Savage &apos;s character from Boy Meets World, but there were no on-screen crossovers. [ Merchandise ] At the height of his popularity, Urkel&apos;s name was branded to several products including a short-lived fruit flavored cereal known as Urkel-Os and a Steve Urkel pullstring doll. There was also a T-shirt line that was created in 2002, but was discontinued shortly after its inception; at that point, Steve Urkel was a decade past his prime.
