Despite the downturn, Hong Kong’s economic strengths, including a sound banking system, virtually no public debt, a strong legal system, ample foreign exchange reserves, rigorous anti-corruption measures and close ties with the mainland China, enable it to quickly respond to changing circumstances. { Background Note:Hong Kong, Diplomacy in action, U.S. Department of State] } Hong Kong&apos;s gross domestic product, between 1961 and 1997, has grown 180 times while per capita GDP rose by 87 times.

By the late 20th century, Hong Kong was the seventh largest port in the world and second only to New York and Rotterdam in terms of container throughput. The Kwai Chung container complex was the largest in Asia; while Hong Kong shipping owners were second only to those of Greece in terms of total tonnage holdings. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the 6th largest in the world, with a market capitalisation of about US$ 2.97 trillion. Hong Kong has also had an abundant supply of labour from the region nearby. A skilled labour force coupled with the adoption of modern British/Western business methods and technology ensured that opportunities for external trade, investment, and recruitment were maximised. Taxation in Hong Kong raises revenues from the sale and taxation of land but not engaged in industry and commerce for profit. From its revenues, the government has built roads, schools, hospitals, and other public infrastructure facilities and services. It has also operated a welfare insurance scheme. The government has avoided running up large budget deficits; and by restraining public borrowing, credit expansion and inflation have been held in check. Despite being one of the world&apos;s richest economies, the Gini Coefficient indicates that the wealth gap continues to widen in Hong Kong. As of 2006 Hong Kong&apos;s measurement is at 53.3, which means the difference between the rich and poor is far greater than that of the mainland China. { Msnbc. &quot; Hong Kong&apos;s wealth gap widens since handover. &quot; HK wealth gap widens.

As of 2006, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) has an average daily turnover of 33.4 billion dollars, which is 12 times that of Shanghai. [ Economic predictions ] { Cathay Pacific } Since the 1997 handover Hong Kong&apos;s economic future became far more exposed to the challenges of economic globalisation competition directly from mainland China. Shanghai claimed in particular to have a geographical advantage, and a municipal government that dreams of turning the city into China&apos;s main economic centre by as early as 2010. The target is to allow Shanghai to catch up to New York by 2040-2050, { Richardson, Harry W. Bae, Chang-Hee C. [2005] (2005) Globalisation and Urban Development: Advances in Spatial Science. ISBN 3-540-22362-2 } with the eventual projection that China will be Asia&apos;s most prosperous economy by 2040. { Burgess, Rod. Jenks, Michael. [2001] (2001) Compact Cities: Sustainable Urban Forms for Developing Countries. United Kingdom: Spon Press. ISBN 0-419-25130-8 } Hong Kong, on the other hand, continues to have a more positive and realistic approach. It will sustainably be the international financial centre in China. Until then, Hong Kong is expected to have higher overall economic figures yearly. Hong Kong&apos;s principal trading partners remain to be China, United States, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, Singapore, and South Korea. [ Positive non-interventionism ] [ Positive non-interventionism ] This policy has often been cited by economist s such as Milton Friedman and the Cato Institute as an example of the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism. However others have argued that the economic strategy was inadequately characterised by the term laissez-faire. { Journal of Contemporary China (2000), 9(24) 291-308 http://psweb.sbs.ohio-state.edu/faculty/mcooper/ps536readings/cheung_interventionism.pdf } They point out that there are still many ways in which the government is involved in the economy. The government has intervened to create economic institutions such as the Hong Kong Stock Market and has been involved in public works projects and social welfare spending. All land in Hong Kong is owned by the government and leased to private users. By restricting the sale of land leases, the Hong Kong government keeps the price of land at what some would say are artificially high prices and this allows the government to support public spending with a low tax rate. { Geocities. &quot; Geocities. &quot; Doesn&apos;t Hong Kong show the potentials of &quot; free market &quot; capitalism?.
