U.S. military leaders, ambassador s, and religious leaders also appear, as well as prominent journalist s and commentator s. Members of prominent think tank s such as Brookings, AEI, Cato, Hoover, and Heritage also are often invited to appear on the Sunday morning talk shows. C-SPAN Radio provides a commercial-free rebroadcast of all five shows in rapid succession, beginning at noon Eastern. Other radio stations rebroadcast some of the shows with commercials on Sunday afternoon. Many local television stations also produce their own programs that air in this time frame, generally focusing on local or state politics rather than national issues.

Many individuals appear via satellite or in studio for two or more of the programs on a given Sunday. Since Fox News Sunday &apos; s debut in 1996, several individuals appeared on all five programs on one day. William H. Ginsburg, attorney for Monica Lewinsky &apos;s family during the Lewinsky scandal, was the first to perform what would be named in his honor as the &quot; Full Ginsburg. &quot; More common is an interviewee appearing on different shows in consecutive weeks; for instance, a Presidential candidate may appear on Meet the Press one week, This Week the next, and Fox News Sunday the week after that.
