[ May 2011 ] { Christmas pudding } Pudding may be served with toppings such as fresh fruit and whipped cream Pudding most often refers to a dessert, but it can also be a savory dish. In the United States, pudding characteristically [ February 2012 ] denotes a sweet milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custard s, instant custards, or a mousse, though it may also refer to other types such as bread and rice pudding. In the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries [ February 2012 ], pudding refers to rich, fairly homogeneous starch- or dairy-based desserts such as rice pudding and Christmas pudding, or, informally, any sweet dish after the main course. The word pudding in this context is also used as a synonym [ February 2012 ] for the dessert course. The word is also used for savory dishes such as Yorkshire pudding, black pudding, suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding. The word pudding is believed to come from the French boudin, originally from the Latin botellus, meaning &quot; small sausage, &quot; referring to encased meats used in Medieval European puddings. [ Olver Lynne The Food Timeline: pudding 2000 http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodpuddings.html 2007-05-03 ] [ Baked, steamed and boiled puddings ] The original pudding was formed by mixing various ingredients with a grain product or other binder such as butter, flour, cereal, eggs, suet, resulting in a solid mass. These puddings are baked, steamed or boiled. Depending on its ingredients such a pudding may be served as a part of the main course or as a dessert. Boiled pudding was a common main course aboard ships in the Royal Navy in the 18th and 19th centuries. Pudding was used as the primary dish in which daily rations of flour and suet were prepared. [ Suet pudding ] Steamed pies consisting of a filling completely enclosed by suet pastry are also known as puddings. These may be sweet or savory and include such dishes as steak and kidney pudding. [ Creamy puddings ] Instant dessert pudding The second and newer type of pudding consists of sugar, milk, and a thickening agent such as cornstarch, gelatin, eggs, rice or tapioca to create a sweet, creamy dessert. These puddings are made either by simmer ing on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler or by baking in an oven, often in a bain-marie. These puddings are easily scorched on the stovetop, which is why a double boiler is often used; microwave oven s are also now often used to avoid this problem and to reduce stirring. Creamy puddings are typically served chilled, but a few, such as zabaglione and rice pudding, may be served warm. Instant puddings do not require boiling and can therefore be prepared much quicker. Kraft Foods, under its gelatin dessert brand Jell-O, is the primary producer of pudding mixes and prepared puddings in North America. This pudding terminology is common in North America and some European countries such as the Netherlands, whilst in Britain egg-thickened puddings are considered custard s and starch-thickened puddings called blancmange.
