[ the political phenomenon the song by Living Colour Cult of Personality (song) ] { Mao Zedong. The caption above the picture reads &quot; The happy life Chairman Mao gives us &quot;. } A cult of personality arises when an individual uses mass media, propaganda, or other methods, to create an idealized and heroic public image, often through unquestioning flattery and praise. { Cult of personality. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved June 25, 2009. } Sociologist Max Weber developed a tripartite classification of authority; the cult of personality holds parallels with what Weber defined as &quot; charismatic authority &quot;. A cult of personality is similar to hero worship, except that it is established by mass media and propaganda. [ Background ] Throughout history, monarchs and heads of state were almost always held in enormous reverence. Through the principle of the divine right of kings, for example, rulers were said to hold office by the will of God. Imperial China (see Mandate of Heaven ), ancient Egypt, Japan, the Inca, the Aztecs, Tibet, Thailand, and the Roman Empire (see imperial cult ) are especially noted for redefining monarchs as god-king s. The spread of democratic and secular ideas in Europe and North America in the 18th and 19th centuries made it increasingly difficult for monarchs to preserve this aura. However, the subsequent development of photography, sound recording, film, and mass production, as well as public education and techniques used in commercial advertising, enabled political leaders to project a positive image like never before. It was from these circumstances in the 20th century that the best-known personality cults arose. Often these cults are a form of political religion. [ Purpose ] [ Secular religion ] Personality cults were first described in relation to totalitarian regimes that sought to radically alter or transform society according to radical ideas. { Kreis, Steven Kreis &quot; Stalin and the Cult of Personality &quot; Retrieved April 06, 2010 } Often, a single leader became associated with this revolutionary transformation, and came to be treated as a benevolent &quot; guide &quot; for the nation without whom the transformation to a better future couldn&apos;t occur. This has been generally the justification for personality cults that arose in totalitarian societies of the 20th century, such as those of Adolf Hitler and Ruhollah Khomeini. Not all dictatorships foster personality cults, not all personality cults are dictatorships (some are nominally democratic), and some leaders may actively seek to minimize their own public adulation. For example, during the Cambodian Khmer Rouge regime, images of dictator Pol Pot (Saloth Sar) were rarely seen in public, and his identity was under dispute abroad until after his fall from power. The same applied to numerous Eastern European Communist regimes following World War II (although not those of Enver Hoxha and Nicolae Ceaușescu, mentioned below). [ Examples ] { Hermann Göring, at a } { Nazi rally in Nuremberg in 1928. } The term cult of personality comes from Karl Marx &apos;s critique of the &quot; cult of the individual &quot; —expressed in a letter to German political worker, Wilhelm Bloss. In that, Marx states thus: [ From my antipathy to any cult of the individual, I never made public during the existence of the [1st] International the numerous addresses from various countries which recognized my merits and which annoyed me... Engels and I first joined the secret society of Communists on the condition that everything making for superstitious worship of authority would be deleted from its statute. ] [ Historical examples ] [ Soviet Union ] Nikita Khrushchev recalled Marx&apos;s criticism in his 1956 &quot; Secret Speech &quot; denouncing Stalin to the 20th Party Congress : [ The Cult of the Individual http://www.guardian.co.uk/greatspeeches/story/0%2C%2C2060198%2C00. 2007-05-24 London ] [ September 2010 RjwilmsiBot ] { This book is an expression of the most dissolute flattery, an example of making a man into a godhead, of transforming him into an infallible sage, &quot; the greatest leader, &quot; &quot; sublime strategist of all times and nations. &quot; Finally no other words could be found with which to lift Stalin up to the heavens. We need not give here examples of the loathsome adulation filling this book. All we need to add is that they all were approved and edited by Stalin personally and some of them were added in his own handwriting to the draft text of the book. &lt; /blockquote &gt; } Some authors (e.g. Alexander Zinovyev ) have argued that Leonid Brezhnev &apos;s rule was also characterized by a cult of personality, though unlike Stalin, Brezhnev did not initiate large-scale persecutions in the country. One of the aspects of Leonid Brezhnev&apos;s cult of personality was Brezhnev&apos;s obsession with titles, rewards and decorations, leading to his inflated decoration with medals, orders and so on. { See e.g. http://oldgazette.ru/kopravda/21021978/01-1.html. The list of Brezhnev&apos;s decorations is available in } { Russian Wikipedia : http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Список_наград_Брежнева } This was often ridiculed by the ordinary people and led to the creation of many political jokes. [ Turkmenistan ] Saparmurat Niyazov, who was ruler of Turkmenistan from 1985 to 2006, is another oft-cited cultivator of a cult of personality. { Government of the United States of America.

International Security Program, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard University. Available on-line at http://www.ciaonet.org/ } Niyazov simultaneously cut funding to and partially disassembled the education system in the name of &quot; reform &quot;, while injecting ideological indoctrination into it by requiring all schools to take his own book, the Ruhnama, as its primary text, and like Kim Il-sung, there is even a creation myth surrounding him. { Soucek, Svat. 2000. A History of Inner Asia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. } During Niyazov&apos;s rule there was no freedom of the press nor was there freedom of speech. This further meant that opposition to Niyazov was strictly forbidden and &quot; major opposition figures have been imprisoned, institutionalized, deported, or have fled the country, and their family members are routinely harassed by the authorities. &quot; Additionally, a silhouette of Niyazov was used as a logo on television broadcasts { Eurasianet. 2007. The Personality Cult Lives On, Residents Take It In Stride. Available on-line at http://www.eurasianet.org/ } and statues and pictures of him were &quot; erected everywhere &quot;. { BBC. December 2006. Obituary: Saparmurat Niyazov.Available on-line at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6199021.stm } For these, and other reasons, the US Government has gone on to claim that by the time he died, &quot; Niyazov’s personality cult...had reached the dimensions of a state-imposed religion &quot;. { United States Commission on International Freedom. 2007.

Chinese Muslim Generals and Imams participated in this cult of personality and One Party state, with Muslim General Ma Bufang making people bow to Dr. Sun&apos;s portrait and listen to the national anthem during a Tibetan and Mongol religious ceremony for the Qinghai Lake God.

[ Invalid length. ] { 375 } { 2010-06-28 } The People&apos;s Republic of China under Mao Zedong can also be considered a cult of personality. After Mao&apos;s death, reforms led to a deconstruction of his cult status and the CCP was aversive to a cult of personality style rule lest it recreate the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. [ Argentina ] Juan Perón, elected three times as President of Argentina, and his second wife, Eva Duarte de Perón, were immensely popular among many of the Argentine people, and to this day they are still considered icons by the Peronist Party. The Peróns&apos; followers praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labor, while their detractors considered them demagogues and dictators. To achieve their political goals, the Peronists had to unite around the head of state. As a result, a personality cult developed around both Perón and his wife. { Politics and Education in Argentina, 1946-1962, by Mónica Esti Rein; trans by Martha Grenzeback. Published by M. E. Sharpe, Armonk, NY/London, 1998, p. 79-80. } [ French Indochina ] Cambodia n schoolchildren in French Indochina at one point in the early 1940s began their school-day with prayers to Marshal Philippe Pétain, opening with the words, &quot; Our father, which art our Leader, glorious be thy name... deliver us from evil &quot;. { Short, Philip. Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare. New York: Henry Holt and Company. 2005. } [ Togo ] In a 2004 article on personality cults, The Economist identified Togo &apos;s Gnassingbé Eyadéma as maintaining an extensive personality cult, to the point of having schoolchildren begin their day by singing his praises. { Toughs at the top: The last personality cults. } { The Economist. December 18, 2004. } [ Current ] [ North Korea ] Journalist Bradley Martin documented the personality cults of North Korea &apos;s father-son leadership, &quot; Great Leader &quot; Kim Il-sung and &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il. { Bradley K. Martin. Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty. ISBN 0-312-32322-0 } While visiting North Korea in 1979 he noted that nearly all music, art, and sculpture that he observed glorified &quot; Great Leader &quot; Kim Il-sung, whose personality cult was then being extended to his son, &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il. { The younger Kim&apos;s pictures were then ubiquitous and his abilities were described as superhuman. } Kim Il-sung rejected the notion that he had created a cult around himself and accused those who suggested so of &quot; factionalism &quot;. A US religious freedom investigation confirmed Martin&apos;s observation that North Korean schoolchildren learn to thank Kim Il-sung for all blessings as part of the cult. [ Thank You Father Kim-Il-Sung http://www.uscirf.gov/images/stories/pdf/nkwitnesses.pdf PDF 2007-12-09 ] Evidence of the cult of Kim Il-sung continues into the 21st century (despite his death in 1994) with the erection of Yeong Saeng ( &quot; eternal life &quot; ) monuments throughout the country, each dedicated to the departed &quot; Great Leader &quot;, at which citizens are expected to pay annual tribute on his official birthday or the anniversary of his death. { &quot; Controversy Stirs Over Kim Monument at PUST &quot; NK Daily. Retrieved 4-24-2010. } [ Turkey ] In Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is commemorated by many memorials throughout the country, such as the Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, the Atatürk Bridge over the Golden Horn (Haliç), the Atatürk Dam, and Atatürk Stadium. Atatürk statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by Turkish Government, and most towns have their own memorial to him. His face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey; his portrait can be seen in all public buildings, in all schools and classrooms, on all school books, on all Turkish lira banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families. [ Faces of the State: Secularism and Public Life in Turkey Navaro-Yashin Yael 2002 Princeton University Press 0-691-08845-4 196–99 ] At the exact time of his death, on every 10 November, at 09:05  am, most vehicles and people in the country&apos;s streets pause for one minute in remembrance. [ Kiss, Bow, Or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries Morrison Terry Conaway, Wayne A. 1994 Adams Media 1-55850-444-3 392 ] In 1951, the Turkish Parliament issued a law (5816) outlawing insults to his reminiscence ( [ Hatırası ] ) or destruction of objects representing him, which is still in force. [ Turkey: Terrorism, Civil Rights, and the European Union Yonah Alexander 2007 Routledge 0-415-44163-3 137 ] A government website { http://www.ihbarweb.org.tr/eng/ihbar_en.php?subject=8 } was created to denounce the websites that violate this law, and the Turkish government as of 2011 has filters in place to block websites deemed to contain materials insulting to his memory. [ Syria ] As one of his strategies to maintain power over Syria, Hafez al-Assad developed a state-sponsored cult of personality. { Personenkulte Im Stalinismus } { By Klaus Heller, Jan Plamper, V &amp; R unipress GmbH, 2004 } Portraits of him, often depicting him engaging in heroic activities, were placed in every public space. He named myriad numbers of places and institutions in Syria after himself, and other members of his family. At school, children were taught to sing songs of adulation about Hafez al-Assad. Teachers would begin each lesson with the song &quot; Our eternal leader, Hafez al-Assad &quot;. In some cases, he portrayed himself with apparently divine properties. Sculptures and portraits depicted him alongside the prophet Mohammad, while, following her death, the government produced portraits of Assad&apos;s mother surrounded by a halo. Syrian officials were made to refer to him as the &apos;Sanctified one&apos; (al-Muqaddas). { Syria Beyond the Peace Process, By Daniel Pipes, (NY 1995) page 15-16 } The personality cult that he developed portrayed him as wise, modest and just leader of the country. This strategy of creating a cult of personality was pursued further by Hafez&apos;s son and current ruler Bashar al-Assad. { Commanding Syria: Bashar Al-Assad And the First Years in Power (B.Tauris, 2007), By Eyal Zisser, page 50 } [ See also ] Charismatic authority Celebrity Imperial cult (ancient Rome) Narcissism Narcissistic leadership Toxic leader Imperial Presidency [ References ] Notes [ 2 ] [ April 2012 ] [ External links ] Why Dictators Love Kitsch by Eric Gibson, The Wall Street Journal, August 10, 2009 Category:Political terms Category:Totalitarianism Category:Dictatorship Category:Stalinism [ fi ] ar:عبادة شخصية bg:Култ към личността ca:Culte a la personalitat cs:Kult osobnosti da:Personkult de:Personenkult es:Culto a la personalidad eo:Kulto al personeco fa:کیش شخصیت fr:Culte de la personnalité gl:Culto á personalidade hr:Kult ličnosti id:Kultus individu it:Culto della personalità he:פולחן אישיות kk:Жеке Басқа Табыну lt:Asmenybės kultas hu:Személyi kultusz nl:Persoonsverheerlijking ja:個人崇拝 pl:Kult jednostki pt:Culto de personalidade ro:Cultul personalității ru:Культ личности sco:Cult o personality sk:Kult osobnosti sr:Култ личности fi:Henkilöpalvonta (politiikka) sv:Personkult uk:Культ особи zh:个人崇拜
