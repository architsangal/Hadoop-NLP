It was a major stop on the ancient Silk Road. It was also known at times as Shāzhōu (沙州), or &apos;City of Sands&apos;, a name still used today, { Cable and French (1943), p. 41. } &quot; or Dukhan as the Turkis call it. &quot; { Skrine (1926), p. 117. } It is best known for the nearby Dunhuang Caves. It is situated in a rich oasis containing Crescent Lake (月牙泉) and Mingsha Shan ( 鸣沙山, literally &quot; Echoing-Sand Mountain &quot; ). Mingsha Shan is so named for the sound of the wind whipping off the dunes, the singing sand phenomenon. It commands a very strategic position at the crossroads of the ancient Southern Silk Route and the main road leading from India via Lhasa to Mongolia and Southern Siberia, as well as controlling the entrance to the narrow Gansu Corridor which led straight to the heart of the north Chinese plains and the ancient capitals of Chang&apos;an (today known as Xi&apos;an) and Luoyang. { Lovell (2006), pp. 74-75. } [ History ] { Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD) Chinese } { watchtower made of } { rammed earth at Dunhuang, Gansu province, the eastern edge of the } { Silk Road } There is evidence of human habitation in the Dunhuang area as early as 2,000 BC, possibly by people recorded as the Qiang in Chinese history. Its name was also mentioned as part of the homeland of the Yuezhi or &quot; Rouzhi &quot; (月氏) in the Shiji (史記), although some have argued that this may refer to an unrelated toponym, Dunhong. By the third century BC, the area became dominated by the Xiongnu, but came under Chinese rule during the Han Dynasty after Emperor Wu defeated the Xiongnu in 121 BC. Dunhuang was one the frontier garrison towns established by the Emperor Wu after the defeat of Xiongnu, and the Chinese built fortifications at Dunhuang and sent settlers there. The name Dunhuang, or Blazing Beacon, refers to the beacons lit to warn of attacks by marauding nomadic tribes. Dunhuang Commandery was probably established in 104 BC, or shortly thereafter. Located in the western end of the Hexi Corridor near the historic junction of the Northern and Southern Silk Road s, Dunhuang was a town of military importance. { Hill (2009), p. 133. } &quot; The Great Wall was extended to Dunhuang, and a line of fortified beacon towers stretched westwards into the desert. By the second century AD Dunhuang had a population of more than 76,000 and was a key supply base for caravans that passed through the city: those setting out for the arduous trek across the desert loaded up with water and food supplies, and others arriving from the west gratefully looked upon the mirage-like sight of Dunhuang&apos;s walls, which signified safety and comfort. Dunhuang prospered on the heavy flow of traffic. The first Buddhist caves in the Dunhuang area were hewn in 353. &quot; { Bonavia (2004), p. 162. } { Tang Period (618-907) Buddhist sutra fragment from Dunhuang } In later centuries, during the Sui and Tang dynasties, it was a major point of communication between ancient China and Central Asia. By the Tang Dynasty it became the major hub of commerce of the Silk Road. Early Buddhist monk s arrived at Dunhuang via the ancient Northern Silk Road, the northernmost route of about [ 2600 km ] in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xi&apos;an westward over the Wushao Ling Pass to Wuwei and on to Kashgar. [ http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid%3D18006 Silk Road, North China, C.M. Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham ] For centuries, Buddhist monks at Dunhuang collected scriptures from the West, and many pilgrims passed through the area, painting murals inside the Mogao Caves or &quot; Caves of a Thousand Buddhas. &quot; { The Silk Road: Two Thousand Years in the Heart of Asia, by } { Frances Wood } A small number of Christian artifacts have also been found in the caves (see Jesus Sutras ), testimony to the wide variety of people who made their way along the Silk Road. { White Horse Pagoda, Dunhuang } As a frontier town, Dunhuang was fought over and occupied at various times by non-Han Chinese nationalities. After the fall of Han Dynasty it was under the rule of various nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu during Northern Liang and the Turkic Tuoba during Northern Wei. The Tibetans occupied Dunhuang when the Tang empire became weakened considerably after the An Lushan Rebellion; and even though it was later returned to Tang rule, it was under quasi-autonomous rule by the local general Zhang Yichao who expelled the Tibetans in 848. After the fall of Tang, Dunhaung was ruled by a local Cao family who formed alliances with the Uighur s and the Kingdom of Khotan. During the Song Dynasty, Dunhuang fell outside the Chinese borders. In 1037 it came under the rule of Shazhou Uighur s, then in 1068 the Tanguts who founded the Xi Xia Dyansty. It was conquered in 1227 by the Mongols who sacked and destroyed the town, and the rebuilt town became part of China again when Kublai Khan conquered the rest of China. Dunhuang went into a steep decline after the Chinese trade with the outside world became dominated by Southern sea-routes, and the Silk Road was officially abandoned during the Ming Dynasty. It was occupied again by the Tibetans in 1516, but retaken by China two centuries later ca. 1715 during Qing Dynasty. Today, the site is an important tourist attraction and the subject of an ongoing archaeological project. A large number of manuscript s and artifacts retrieved at Dunhuang have been digitized and made publicly available via the International Dunhuang Project.
