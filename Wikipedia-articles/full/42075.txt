[ Axios ] [ 40 30 27 N 22 43 3 E inline,title ] { Republic of Macedonia, } { Greece } { 388 km } Veles Gorge { Skopje : the } { Stone Bridge. } The Vardar or Axios ( [ Mk-Vardar.ogg Вардар ]; [ Vardari ]; [ Αξιός Axiósor Βαρδάρης Vardárīs ] ) is the longest and major river in the Republic of Macedonia and also a major river of Greece. It is [ 388 km mi 0 on ] long, and drains an area of around [ 25000 km2 sqmi 0 on ]. The maximum depth of river is [ 4 m ft 0 on ]. Map of northwestern Macedonia showing the Vardar The river rises at Vrutok, a few kilometers north of Gostivar in the Republic of Macedonia. It passes through Gostivar, Skopje and into Veles, crosses the Greek border near Gevgelija, Polykastro and Axioupoli ( &quot; town on the Axiós &quot; ), before emptying into the Aegean Sea in Central Macedonia west of Thessaloniki in northern Greece. The Vardar basin includes two-thirds of the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The area is sometimes called &quot; Vardar Macedonia &quot; after the river, to distinguish it from &quot; Aegean Macedonia &quot; (in Greece) and &quot; Pirin Macedonia &quot; (in Bulgaria). The valley comprises fertile lands in Polog, and Thessaloniki prefectures and Gevgelija and other parts. The river is surrounded by mountains elsewhere. The superhighways Greek National Road 1 in Greece and M1 and E75 run within the valley along the river&apos;s entire length to near Skopje. The river is depicted on the coat of arms of Skopje, which in turn is incorporated in the city&apos;s flag. { Official portal of the city of Skopje: City symbols. – Retrieved on 13 May 2009. } [ Vardaris/Vardarec wind ] The Vardaris or Vardarec is a powerful prevailing northerly ravine wind which blows across the river valley in Greek Macedonia as well as in the Republic of Macedonia. At first it descends along the &quot; canal &quot; of the Vardar valley, usually as a breeze. When it encounters the high mountains that separate Greece from the Republic of Macedonia, it descends the other side, gathering a tremendous momentum and bringing cold conditions to the city of Thessaloniki and the Axios delta. Somewhat similar to the mistral wind of France, it occurs when atmospheric pressure over eastern Europe is higher than over the Aegean Sea, as is often the case in winter. [ Etymology ] The most accepted theory on the origin of the name Vardar derives Bardários from the Thracian language, from PIE *(s)wordo-wori- &apos;black water&apos; Orel, Vladimir. A Handbook of Germanic Etymology. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003: 392. (cf. German schwarz &apos;black&apos;, Latin suāsum &apos;dirt&apos;, Ossetian xuaræn &apos;color&apos;, Persian xvāl &apos;lampblack&apos;, Old Irish sorb &apos;stain, dirt&apos; Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams. Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture. London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997: 147 ). This can be considered a translation or similar meaning of Axios, itself Thracian for &apos;not-shining&apos; from PIE *n.-sk(e)i (cf. Avestan axšaēna &apos;dark-coloured&apos;), Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams. Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture. London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997, p. 146 and found in another name at the mouth of the Danube, Axíopa &quot; dark water &quot;, renamed in Slavic Crna voda &apos;black water&apos;. Katičic&apos;, Radoslav. Ancient Languages of the Balkans. Paris: Mouton, 1976: 149 The name Bardários (Βαρδάριος) was sometimes used by the Ancient Greeks in the 3rd Century BCE; the same name was widely used during Byzantine era. In the Albanian language, the word &quot; vardar &quot; means a place where two creeks or rivers join together, or the joint flow of two rivers. { ASHASH, Fjalori i Gjuhës së Sotme Shqipe, 1982 } The etymology of the word is unclear, although the Vardar river, in fact, has Lepenac as a major tributary. The word is also an adverb meaning &quot; consecutively &quot; or &quot; actively &quot; and may be related to its synonym varda(whose dictionary definition also includes &quot; freely &quot; or &quot; unimpeded &quot; ) and the verb vardoj/me vardue, which means &quot; to work (extensively). &quot; { Ibid. } The words may ultimately derive from the Indo-European root *werǵ-, which is also the source of the English word &quot; to work. &quot; Its Greek name Axios (Αξιός) is mentioned by Homer (Il. 21.141, Il. 2.849 Axios, Georg Autenrieth, &apos;&apos;A Homeric Dictionary&apos;&apos;, at Perseus ) as the home of the Paeonians, allies of Troy.
