Patrick Miller Saved Her Life And Several Others During Ambush, Tricia McDermott, NEW YORK, Nov. 6, 2003 } He continues to serve in the US Army. [ Background ] Miller was a 1998 graduate of Valley Center High School in Valley Center, Kansas a town of 5,000 people outside Wichita, Kansas. Employed in civilian life as a welder, he joined the army in summer 2002, to help pay for his student loans. [ 507th Ambush ] On March 23, 2003, Iraqi forces ambushed the trail convoy element of the 507th Maintenance Company that had taken a wrong turn near An Nasiriyah. There had been bitter fighting around Nasiriyah, a vital crossing point of the River Euphrates. Miller was driving the last truck in the convoy with Private First Class Brandon Sloan and Sergeant James Riley as passengers. During the attack, he floored the accelerator, trying to steer and duck bullets at the same time. Enemy fire killed Sloan and damaged his truck&apos;s transmission, disabling the vehicle. [ Silver Star and other awards ] Prior to his capture, Miller had stood his ground firing at the Iraqis with a malfunctioning weapon, feeding bullets into it by hand to protect two wounded comrades. A U.S. Army press release said Miller jumped from his vehicle and began firing on a mortar position that he believed was about to open fire on his convoy. Miller was held for 22 days with four other members of his unit including: Spc. Edgar Hernandez - Mission, TX. Spc. Joseph Hudson - Alamogordo, NM. Spc. Shoshana Johnson - El Paso, TX. Sgt. James Riley - Pennsauken, N.J. Pvt. Jessica Lynch - Palestine, WV. Part of same unit but held separately in a different location After he was captured, he was repeatedly questioned about radio frequencies that were written on pieces of paper inside his helmet. &quot; Thinking on his feet, Pfc. Miller told his captors that they were prices for power steering pumps, &quot; the release said. &quot; Disgusted, the captors threw the frequencies and his helmet into the fire. &quot; For these actions he was awarded the Silver Star the third-highest military award for heroism in combat. Along with the Silver Star, Patrick Miller also received a Purple Heart and Prisoner of War Medal on July 2, 2003, during an Independence Day celebration at Fort Bliss, Texas. On 20 July 2005, while serving with the 183rd Maintenance Company, Fort Carson, Miller was awarded the Combat Action Badge by retired Command Sergeant Major Tyler Walker. The U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) at Fort Belvoir, Virginia named its operations center and dedicated a wall in Miller&apos;s honor in January 2004. Miller attended the ceremony with his mother and his wife and their two small children. [ Silver Star Citation Synopsis ] &quot; The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Patrick Miller, Private First Class, U.S. Army, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Mechanic with the 507th Maintenance Company, 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, during combat operations in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, near An Nasiriya, Iraq, on 23 March 2003. On that date a huge American convoy headed from Kuwait to Baghdad. A dozen heavy trucks and other maintenance vehicles fell behind the rest and got lost. At sunrise, Iraqi troops ambushed the lost soldiers, firing from both sides of the highway. The Americans sped up to escape the attack, but one Humvee smashed into the back of a jack-knifed American tractor-trailer. Less than a mile behind that accident, Private Miller was driving the last truck in the convoy. During the attack, he floored the accelerator, trying to steer and duck bullets at the same time. During the ensuing battle he single-handedly stopped a mortar attack aimed at trapped soldiers. &quot; { HomeOfHeroes.Com, Silver Star Citations, Global War on Terror } [ Miller as a POW ] He was one of five POWs to be interviewed on Al Jazeera. In the interview, he was asked why he came to Iraq, his reply was &quot; I come to fix broke stuff. &quot; Asked if he came to shoot Iraqis, he answered, &quot; No, I come to shoot only if I am shot at. They don&apos;t bother me, I don&apos;t bother them. &quot; Miller lost 25 pounds in three weeks as a prisoner of war, eating boiled chicken, rice and bread so hard he had to throw it against the wall to get at the soft food inside. [ After Iraq ] After returning to Fort Bliss, Texas, Miller stayed on active duty with the U.S. Army and was transferred to Fort Carson, Colorado. He is currently a Staff Sergeant. [ Quotes ] &quot; It&apos;s good to know that you actually did something to save other people&apos;s lives, &quot; he says. &quot; But for me, as far as people saying that I&apos;m a hero, I don&apos;t feel that I&apos;m a hero. Because I feel that I was doing my job as a soldier. &quot; Miller on CBS 60 Minutes &quot; I&apos;m not real worried about awards, The way I look at it, I did my job. &quot; Patrick Miller [ References ] Hegeman, Roxana, &quot; &apos;Please Do Something for My Son&apos; - Families Identify Soldiers Held Captive in Iraq &quot;.
