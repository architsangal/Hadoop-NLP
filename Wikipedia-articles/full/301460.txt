Upon his birth, his father called for an astrologer, who stated that Balan&apos;s birth was an auspicious one, and that he was destined for greatness. He studied Science at Maharaja&apos;s College at Ernakulam and Liberal Arts at St. Thomas College, Thrissur. He graduated from Madras University in 1939 and went on to do graduate study in English literature from Lucknow University. [ Participation in Freedom Movement ] Balakrishna Menon took part in the Quit India Movement in 1942. He was deeply involved in the movement and used to write and distribute pamphlets and write speeches. Within a week, hundreds were dead and thousands were imprisoned in jails. After sometime, news of his imminent arrest reached Balan. For a whole Year of 1943 he stayed in Kashmir. He then left Kashmir for Delhi but, on the way in Abbottabad he saw that the British Police were searching for him. He ran away from the bus and on the way he saw a British Military Intelligence Communication Centre. He pretended to be a young man looking for a job. He was hired immediately as a machine operator for relaying coded messages. After eight months of service, He left the job and again participated in the Freedom Movement, thinking that the British Police had forgotten him after two years. But unfortunately he was caught and put into a cold, dark cell with other Freedom Fighters, with little food and poor hygienic conditions. Disease was rampant, and many political prisoners died each day. The British did not want to admit to or deal with the increasing number of deaths in the prison. Balan, too, fell ill with typhus. The police thought that he was dead too. The next morning they laid him on the road. After a while, a woman came and stopped her car. She thought that Balan was her own son, who was with the British troops in Europe. She took Balan to her home and after several weeks, he recovered. Once recovered, Balan caught a train to Baroda ( Vadodra ). [ Initiation and disciple hood ] { Sannyas &apos;&apos; initiation, standing on the right of Guru } { Swami Sivananda and other disciples, Feb 25, 1949, } { Maha Shivratri Day, } { Rishikesh. } Balan entered the field of journalism, and worked for The National Herald, where he felt he could influence political, economic and social reform in India. While working at the Herald, he went to meet Swami Sivananda at Ananda Kutir, Swami Sivananda&apos;s Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh as he planned to write an article critical of Hindu monks, but instead his life was changed forever and he became interested in the Hindu spiritual path. { Swami Chinmayananda Biography Chinmaya Mission. } { Letters } Balakrishna Menon took sanyas deeksha (monkhood) from Swami Sivananda on Mahashivratri day on February 25, 1949, { Gurudev - Early Days (Initiation Day photograph } { Chinmaya Mission. } and was thus given the name Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati - the one who is saturated in Bliss and pure Consciousness. He stayed at Sivanada Ashram, Rishikesh for several years, and subsequently Swami Sivananda saw further potential in Swami Chinmayananda and sent him to study under a guru in the Himalayas - Swami Tapovan Maharaj under whom he studied for the following years. Swami Tapovan Maharaj was known for his rigid teaching style, to the point where he told Swami Chinmayananda that he would only say everything once, and at anytime he would ask questions to him. Even with these extreme terms, Swami Chinmayananda stayed with Tapovan maharaj until the very end of 8 years. Being a journalist at heart, Swami Chinmayananda wanted to make this pure knowledge available to all people of all backgrounds, even though Tapovan Maharaj had initially advised against it. Through gentle persuasion and a promise that he would, as the Ganges River, take the knowledge to the plains for the benefit of all Indians, with Tapovan Maharaj&apos;s blessings, he left the Himalayas in 1952, to teach the world the knowledge of Vedanta. [ Works ] [ 20% right &quot; Love is to human heart what sunshine is to the flowers. &quot; ] Swami Chinmayananda started the tradition of Jnana Yagna s, in an effort to spread the message of the Geeta and the Upanishads, thus the first such Geeta Gyana Yagna was held in Pune between December 31, 1951 and April 1952. In his whole Lifetime he had done almost 690 Jnana Yagna. [ Understanding the Geeta http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19981221/35551624.html December 21, 1998 ] In 1953, his closest disciples founded the Chinmaya Mission, named so to indicate that the goal of its followers was infinite bliss. During his forty years of travelling and teaching, Swami Chinmayananda opened numerous centres and ashrams worldwide, he also built many schools, hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. He played a major role in the renovation of many temples. His interest in helping the villagers with basic necessities lead to the eventual creation of a rural development project, known as the Chinmaya Organization for Rural Development or CORD. Its National Director, Dr. Kshama Metre was recently awarded the Padma Shree National award in Social Work. [ Death ] Swami Chinmayananda died on 4 August 1993 in San Diego, California after suffering his fourth heart attack. He was aged 77 at the time of his death. His mortal remains were placed in a Samadhi on 19 August 1993, at the Sidhbari Ashram in the Himalayas. [ Legacy ] Today, his legacy remains in the form of the vibrant international organization called the Chinmaya Mission. This mission serves Swami Chinmayananda&apos;s vision of reinvigorating India&apos;s rich cultural heritage, and making Vedanta accessible to everybody regardless of age, nationality, or religious background. Over 10,000 members of the Chinmaya Mission from over the world gathered in Mumbai in December 2001 to commemorate 50 years of the first Gyana Yagna at Pune.
