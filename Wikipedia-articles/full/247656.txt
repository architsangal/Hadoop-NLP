[ History ] Mahone Bay was first settled in 1754 during Father Le Loutre&apos;s War. The first to arrive were those who lived in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and had farm lots throughout the peninsula, including Mahone Bay. The people who settled on the Lunenburg Peninsula, including the present-day village of Mahone Bay, were foreign protestants who were German, Swiss, and Montbéliard ais settlers. { Among the settlers were the Hyson, Zwicker, Keddy, Eisenhauer/Eisner, Weinacht/Whynot, Ernst, and Veinot families. All these names can be found in the area today. The old } { cemetery, known as Bayview Cemetery, has some 18th-century slate gravestones engraved in German. } During the French and Indian War (which included the Expulsion of the Acadians ), there were nine Native and Acadian (Catholic) raids against the protestant settlers on the Lunenburg Peninsula. The French, Acadians and natives were resisting the British control over Nova Scotia and Acadia. One such raid – the Raid on Lunenburg (1756) – happened just off the shores of Mahone Bay on present-day Covey Island and [John] Rous Island. { HMS &apos;&apos;Hogue&apos;&apos;, which trapped the &apos;&apos; } { Young Teazer &apos;&apos; } Another raid happened on 24 August 1758 in the village of Mahone Bay, when eight Mi&apos;kmaq attacked the family homes of Lay and Brant. While they killed three people in the raid, the Mi&apos;kmaq were unsuccessful in taking their scalps, which was the common practice for payment from the French. [ Bell Wintrop Packard The &quot; Foreign Protestants &quot; and the Settlement of Nova Scotia: The History of a Piece of Arrested British Colonial Policy in the Eighteenth Century University of Toronto Press 1961 511 ] During the War of 1812, the American privateer schooner Young Teazer was trapped off the shores of Mahone Bay by the HMS Hogue (1811). To avoid capture, a crew member of the Young Teazer destroyed his own ship, killing most of the crew. { Archibald MecMechan. Sagas of the Sea. } The town prospered with wooden shipbuilding in the 19th century. While shipbuilding decline with the arrival of steel and steam vessels, Mahone Bay became known for its boatbuilding. World War I and II brought brief revivals of shipbuilding with construction of schooners, tugs and barges. After the war, the ship yard became known for innovative production of moulded plywood boats. [ Today ] The town&apos;s three churches viewed from the east The town is also known for a history of wooden boat building, it was the main industry of Mahone Bay in its earlier years. The Settler&apos;s Museum explains and shows this history in detail. Until recent years the town&apos;s shipbuilding and boatbuilding heritage was celebrated by the &quot; Mahone Bay Wooden Boat Festival &quot;. The view across the harbour of its three prominent churches (St James Anglican; Lutheran; and United ) has become an iconic image of Nova Scotia, frequently photographed and featured on postcards and calendars.
