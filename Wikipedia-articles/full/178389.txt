In 1861, Lavik (population: 926) was merged with Brekke municipality (population: 898), located across the Sognefjord, to form the new municipality of Lavik og Brekke. In 1862 the sub-parish (sokn) of Bø in the western part of the municipality was removed from Lavik og Brekke and merged with the Øn and Hyllestad sub-parishes (sokn) from Askvoll to form a new municipality which was named Hyllestad.
