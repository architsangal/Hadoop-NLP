[ the broken window fallacy in economic theory ] { Pruitt–Igoe housing development } The broken windows theory is a criminological theory of the norm setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and vandalism on additional crime and anti-social behavior. The theory states that monitoring and maintaining urban environments in a well-ordered condition may stop further vandalism and escalation into more serious crime. The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. Since then it has been subject to great debate both within the social science s and in the public sphere. The theory has been used as a motivation for several reforms in criminal policy. The broken windows theory has received support from several empirical studies. At the same time it has also been the subject of a large body of criticism. [ Article and book ] The broken windows theory was first introduced by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, in an article titled &quot; Broken Windows &quot; and which appeared in the March 1982 edition of The Atlantic Monthly. [ http://www.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/_atlantic_monthly-broken_windows.pdf James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling BROKEN WINDOWS: The police and neighborhood safety 2007-09-03 PDF ] { ( HTML version ) } The title comes from the following example: [ Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it&apos;s unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside. Or consider a sidewalk. Some litter accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of trash from take-out restaurants there or breaking into cars. ] The article received a great deal of attention and was very widely cited. A 1996 criminology and urban sociology book, Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities by George L. Kelling and a co-author Catharine Coles, is based on the article but develops the argument in greater detail. It discusses the theory in relation to crime and strategies to contain or eliminate crime from urban neighborhoods. { George Kelling and Catherine Coles. Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities, ISBN 0-684-83738-2. } A successful strategy for preventing vandalism, say the book&apos;s authors, is to fix the problems when they are small. Repair the broken windows within a short time, say, a day or a week, and the tendency is that vandals are much less likely to break more windows or do further damage. Clean up the sidewalk every day, and the tendency is for litter not to accumulate (or for the rate of littering to be much less). Problems do not escalate and thus respectable residents do not flee a neighborhood. The theory thus makes two major claims: that further petty crime and low-level anti-social behavior will be deterred, and that major crime will, as a result, be prevented. Criticism of the theory has tended to focus only on the latter claim. [ Theoretical explanation ] The reason why the state of the urban environment may affect crime may be described as due to three factors: social norm s and conformity, the presence or lack of routine monitoring, and social signaling and signal crime. In an anonymous, urban environment, with few or no other people around, social norms and monitoring are not clearly known. Individuals thus look for signals within the environment as to the social norms in the setting and the risk of getting caught violating those norms; one of those signals is the area&apos;s general appearance. Under the broken windows theory, an ordered and clean environment – one which is maintained – sends the signal that the area is monitored and that criminal behavior will not be tolerated. Conversely, a disordered environment – one which is not maintained (broken windows, graffiti, excessive litter) – sends the signal that the area is not monitored and that one can engage in criminal behavior with little risk of detection. [ Support for the theory ] [ New York City ] The book&apos;s author, George L. Kelling, was hired as a consultant to the New York City Transit Authority in 1985, and measures to test the broken windows theory were implemented by David Gunn. The presence of graffiti was intensively targeted, and the subway system was cleaned from 1984 until 1990. Kelling has also been hired as a consultant to Boston &apos;s and Los Angeles &apos;s Police Department s. In 1990, William J. Bratton became head of the New York City Transit Police. Bratton described George L. Kelling as his &quot; intellectual mentor &quot;, and implemented zero tolerance of fare-dodging, easier arrestee processing methods and background checks on all those arrested. Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani hired Bill Bratton as his police commissioner who adopted the strategy more widely in New York City after Giuliani&apos;s election in 1993, under the rubrics of &quot; quality of life &quot; and &quot; zero tolerance &quot;. Thus, Giuliani&apos;s &quot; zero-tolerance &quot; roll out was part of an interlocking set of wider reforms, crucial parts of which had been underway since 1985. Bratton had the police more strictly enforce the law against subway fare evasion, public drinking, urination, and the &quot; squeegee men &quot; who had been wiping windshields of stopped cars and demanding payment. According to the 2001 study of crime trends in New York by George Kelling and William Sousa, { Corman, Hope. Carrots, Sticks and Broken Windows (2002) [Requires washington.edu account] } rates of both petty and serious crime fell suddenly and significantly, and continued to drop for the following ten years. [ Albuquerque ] Similar success occurred in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the late 1990s with its Safe Streets Program. Operating under the theory that American Westerners use roadways much in the same way that American Easterners use subways, the developers of the program reasoned that lawlessness on the roadways had much the same effect as the problem individuals in New York subways. This program was extensively reviewed by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and published in a case study. { U.S. Department of Transportation - NHTSA - Albuquerque Police Department&apos;s SAFE STREETS PROGRAM DOT HS 809 278 } [ Lowell, Massachusetts ] In 2005, Harvard University and Suffolk University researchers worked with local police to identify 34 &quot; crime hot spots &quot; in Lowell, Massachusetts. In half of the spots, authorities cleared trash, fixed streetlights, enforced building codes, discouraged loiterers, made more misdemeanor arrests, and expanded mental health services and aid for the homeless. In the other half, there was no change to routine police service. The areas that received additional attention experienced a 20% reduction in calls to the police. The study concluded that cleaning up the physical environment is more effective than misdemeanor arrests, and that increasing social services had no effect. [ http://www.suffolk.edu/34417.html Suffolk University – Research Boosts Broken Windows 2009-02-20 ] { 2009-02-20 } { The Boston Globe } { Carolyn Y. } { Johnson } { 2009-02-08 } [ The Netherlands ] In 2007 and 2008 Kees Keizer and colleagues from the University of Groningen conducted a series of controlled experiments to determine if the effect of existing disorder (such as litter or graffiti) increased the incidence of additional crime like stealing, littering or conducting other acts of antisocial behavior. They selected several urban locations which they then arranged in two different ways, at different times. In one condition—the control—the place was maintained orderly. It was kept free from graffiti, broken windows, etc. In the other condition—the experiment—exactly the same environment was arranged in a way where it looked like nobody monitored it and cared about it: windows were broken, graffiti were placed on the walls, among other things. The researchers then secretly monitored the locations to observe if people behaved differently when the environment was disordered. The results supported the theory. Their conclusion, published in the journal &apos;&apos;Science&apos;&apos;, was that: [ 10.1126/science.1161405 http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1161405 Keizer K Lindenberg S Steg L The Spreading of Disorder 2008-11-28 Science 322 5908 1681–5 2008 19023045 ] [ http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id%3D12630201 Can the can – Nov 20th 2008 2008-11-24 The Economist 2008-11-20 ] [ Other advantages ] [ Real estate ] Other side effects of better monitoring and cleaned up streets may well be desired by governments or housing agencies, as well as the population of a neighborhood: broken windows can count as an indicator of low real estate value, and may deter investors. Fixing windows is therefore also a step of real estate development, which may lead, desired or not, to gentrification. [ Schools ] In the education realm, the broken windows theory is used to promote order in classrooms and school cultures. The belief is that students are signaled by disorder or rule-breaking and that they, in turn, imitate the disorder. Several school movements—most notably with the charter school movement—encourage strict paternalistic practices to enforce student discipline. Such practices include language codes (governing slang, curse words, or speaking out of turn), classroom etiquette (sitting up straight, tracking the speaker), personal dress (uniforms, little or no jewelry), and behavioral codes (walking in lines, specified bathroom times). Several schools have made remarkable strides in educational gains with this philosophy such as KIPP and American Indian Public Charter School. From 2004 to 2006, Stephen B. Plank and colleagues from John Hopkins University conducted a correlational study to determine the degree to which the physical appearance of the school and classroom setting influence student behavior, particularly in respect to the variables concerned in their study: fear, social disorder, and collective efficacy. [ Plank Stephen B. Bradshaw, Catherine P., Young, Hollie An Application of &quot; Broken‐Windows &quot; and Related Theories to the Study of Disorder, Fear, and Collective Efficacy in Schools American Journal of Education 1 February 2009 115 2 227–247 10.1086/595669 25 April 2012 ] They collected survey data administered to 6 th -8 th students by 33 public schools in a large mid-Atlantic city. From analyses of the survey data, the researchers determined that the variables concerning their study are statistically significant to the physical conditions of the school and classroom setting. Their conclusion, published in the American Journal of Education, was that: [...the findings of the current study suggest that educators and researchers should be vigilant about factors that influence student perceptions of climate and safety. Fixing broken windows and attending to the physical appearance of a school cannot alone guarantee productive teaching and learning, but ignoring them likely greatly increases the chances of a troubling downward spiral. ] [ Criticism of the theory ] [ Other factors ] Many critics state that there are factors, other than physical disorder, that more significantly influence crime rate. They argue that, in order to more effectively reduce crime rate, these factors should be paid more attention to or targeted instead. According to a study conducted by Robert J. Sampson and Stephen W. Raudenbush, the premise that the broken windows theory operates on—that social disorder and crime are connected as part of a causal chain—is faulty. They argue that a third factor, collective efficacy, “defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space,” is the actual cause of varying crime rates that are observed in an altered neighborhood environment. They also argue that the relationship between public disorder and crime rate is weak. [ Sampson Robert J. Raudenbush, Stephen W. Systematic Social Observation of Public Spaces: A New Look at Disorder in Urban Neighborhoods American Journal of Sociology 1 November 1999 105 3 603–651 10.1086/210356 ] C. R. Sridhar, in his article in the Economic and Political Weekly, also challenges the broken windows policing and the notion introduced in the annotated by Kelling and Bratton—that aggressive policing, such as the “zero tolerance” police strategy adopted by William Bratton, the appointed commissioner of the New York Police Department —is the sole cause of the decrease of crime rates in New York City. [ Sridhar C.R. Broken Windows and Zero Tolerance: Policing Urban Crimes Economic and Political Weekly 13-19 2006 May 41 19 1841–1843 http://www.jstor.org/stable/4418196 ] This policy targeted people in areas with a significant amount of physical disorder and there appeared to be a causal relationship between the adoption of the aggressive policy and the decrease in crime rate. Sridhar, however, discusses other trends (such as New York City&apos;s economic boom in the late 1990s) that created a &quot; perfect storm &quot; —that they all contributed to the decrease of crime rate much more significantly than the application of the zero tolerance policy. Sridhar also compares this decrease of crime rate with other major cities that adopted other various policies, and determined that the zero tolerance policy is not as effectual. [ Criminology ] According to most criminologists who speak of a broader &quot; backlash &quot;, { The term &quot; backlash &quot; refers to the wave of &quot; tough-on-crime &quot; policies in the U.S. beginning in the 1980s. } the broken windows theory is not theoretically sound. { Thacher, David. (2004) &quot; Order Maintenance Reconsidered &quot;. } They claim that the &quot; broken windows theory &quot; closely relates correlation with causality, a reasoning which is prone to fallacy. David Thacher, assistant professor of public policy and urban planning at the University of Michigan, stated in a 2004 paper that: [ [S]ocial science has not been kind to the broken windows theory. A number of scholars reanalyzed the initial studies that appeared to support it.... Others pressed forward with new, more sophisticated studies of the relationship between disorder and crime. The most prominent among them concluded that the relationship between disorder and serious crime is modest, and even that relationship is largely an artifact of more fundamental social forces. ] It has also been argued that rates of major crimes also dropped in many other U.S. cities during the 1990s, both those that had adopted &quot; zero-tolerance &quot; policies and those that had not. { Bernard E. Harcourt, &quot; Illusion of Order: The False Promise of Broken Windows Policing &quot; (Harvard 2001) ISBN 0-674-01590-8. } In the Winter 2006 edition of the University of Chicago Law Review, Bernard Harcourt and Jens Ludwig looked at the later Department of Housing and Urban Development program that re-housed inner-city project tenants in New York into more orderly neighborhoods. [ Harcourt Bernard E. Ludwig, Jens http://ssrn.com/abstract%3D743284 Broken Windows: New Evidence from New York City and a Five-City Social Experiment University of Chicago Law Review 73 2006 ] The broken windows theory would suggest that these tenants would commit less crime once moved, due to the more stable conditions on the streets. Harcourt and Ludwig found instead that the tenants continued to commit crime at the same rate. In a 2007 study called &quot; Reefer Madness &quot; in the journal Criminology and Public Policy, Harcourt and Ludwig found further evidence confirming that mean reversion fully explained the changes in crime rates in the different precincts in New York during the 1990s [ December 2011 ]. Further alternative explanations that have been put forward include the waning of the crack epidemic, [ http://www.slate.com/id/2141424/ Metcalf Stephen The Giuliani Presidency? A new documentary makes the case against the outsized mayor. 2007-09-03 ] unrelated growth in the prison population due to Rockefeller drug laws, and that the number of males aged 16–24 was dropping regardless due to the shape of the US population pyramid.

Dubner Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything HarperCollins 2005 New York, NY 0-06-073132-X ] [ Drawbacks in practice ] A low-level intervention of police in neighborhoods has been considered problematic. Accordingly, Gary Stewart writes that &quot; The central drawback of the approaches advanced by Wilson, Kelling, and Kennedy rests in their shared blindness to the potentially harmful impact of broad police discretion on minority communities. &quot; { Gary Stewart, Black Codes and Broken Windows: The Legacy of Racial Hegemony in Anti-Gang Civil Injunctions. The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 107, No. 7 (May, 1998), pp. 2249–2279. } This was seen by the authors, who worried that people would be arrested &quot; for the &apos;crime&apos; of being undesirable &quot;. According to Stewart, arguments for low-level police intervention, including the broken windows hypothesis, often act &quot; as cover for racist behavior &quot;. The application of the broken windows theory in aggressive policing policies, such as William J. Bratton &apos;s zero-tolerance policy, has been shown to criminalize the poor and homeless. This is because the physical signs that characterize a neighborhood with the “disorder” that broken windows policing targets correlate with the socio-economic conditions of its inhabitants. Many of the acts that are considered legal, but “disorderly” are often targeted in public settings and are not targeted when conducted in private. Therefore, those without access to a private space are often criminalized. Critics such as Robert J. Sampson and Stephen Raudenbush of Harvard University see the application of the broken windows theory in policing as a war against the poor as opposed to a war against more serious crimes. [ Sampson R. J. Raudenbush, S. W. Seeing Disorder: Neighborhood Stigma and the Social Construction of &quot; Broken Windows &quot; Social Psychology Quarterly 1 December 2004 67 4 319–342 10.1177/019027250406700401 ] In Dorothy Roberts &apos; article, &quot; Foreword: Race, Vagueness, and the Social Meaning of Order Maintenance and Policing, &quot; she focuses on problems of the application of the broken windows theory that lead to the criminalization of communities of color, who are typically disfranchised.

[ Roberts Dorothy Foreword: Race, Vagueness, and the Social Meaning of Order-Maintenance Policing The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 1999 Spring 89 3 775–836 http://www.jstor.org/stable/1144123 ] According to Bruce D. Johnson, Andrew Golub, and James McCabe, the application of the broken windows theory in policing and policy-making can result in development projects that decrease physical disorder but promote undesired gentrification. Oftentimes, when a city is “improved” in this way, the development of an area can cause the cost of living to rise higher than residents can afford, thus forcing low income people, often minorities, out of the area. As the space changes, middle- and upper class, often white, people begin to move into the area, resulting in the gentrification of urban, low income areas. The local residents are affected negatively by this application of the broken windows theory, ending up evicted from their homes as if their presence indirectly contributed to the area’s problem of “physical disorder”. [ In popular press ] In the best-seller More Guns, Less Crime (University of Chicago Press, 2000), economist John Lott, Jr. examined the use of the broken windows approach as well as community- and problem-oriented policing programs in cities over 10,000 in population over two decades. He found that the impacts of these policing policies were not very consistent across different types of crime. Lott&apos;s book has been subject to criticism, though other groups support Lott&apos;s conclusions. In the best-seller Freakonomics, economist Steven D. Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner both confirm and cast doubt on the notion that the broken windows theory was responsible for New York&apos;s drop in crime.
