[ Unix, Unix-like, or Linux ] POSIX ( [ icon ˈ p ɒ z ɪ k s ] [ POZ iks ] ), an acronym for &quot; Portable Operating System Interface &quot;, is a family of standard s specified by the IEEE for maintaining compatibility between operating system s. POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shell s and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems. [ POSIX http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/posix/ Standards IEEE ] [ Name ] Originally, the name &quot; POSIX &quot; referred to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, released in 1988. The family of POSIX standards is formally designated as IEEE 1003 and the international standard name is ISO / IEC 9945. The standards, formerly known as IEEE-IX, emerged from a project that began circa 1985. Richard Stallman suggested the name POSIX in response to an IEEE request for a memorable name. [ 2006-02-02 POSIX 1003.1 FAQ Version 1.12 http://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/posix_faq.html 2006-07-16 ] [ Overview ] The POSIX specifications for Unix -like operating system environments originally consisted of a single document for the core programming interface, but eventually grew to 19 separate documents (for example, POSIX.1, POSIX.2 etc). The standardized user command line and scripting interface were based on the Korn shell [ October 2010 ]. Many user-level programs, services, and utilities including awk, echo, ed were also standardized, along with required program-level services including basic I/O ( file, terminal, and network ) services. POSIX also defines a standard threading library API which is supported by most modern operating systems. Nowadays, most of POSIX parts are combined into a single standard, IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, also known as POSIX.1-2008. [ 2009 ], POSIX documentation is divided in two parts: [ http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/ctg/posix_form.htm POSIX NIST ] POSIX.1-2008: POSIX Base Definitions, System Interfaces, and Commands and Utilities (which include POSIX.1, extensions for POSIX.1, Real-time Services, Threads Interface, Real-time Extensions, Security Interface, Network File Access and Network Process-to-Process Communications, User Portability Extensions, Corrections and Extensions, Protection and Control Utilities and Batch System Utilities) POSIX Conformance Testing: A test suite for POSIX accompanies the standard: PCTS or the POSIX Conformance Test Suite. The development of the POSIX standard takes place in the Austin Group, a joint working group linking the Open Group and the ISO organization. [ Versions ] [ Parts before 1997 ] Before 1997, POSIX comprised several standards: [ POSIX.1 ] Process Creation and Control Signals Floating Point Exceptions Segmentation / Memory Violations Illegal Instructions Bus Errors Timers File and Directory Operations Pipes C Library (Standard C) I/O Port Interface and Control Process Triggers [ POSIX.1b ] Priority Scheduling Real-Time Signals Clocks and Timers Semaphores Message Passing Shared Memory Asynch and Synch I/O Memory Locking Interface [ POSIX.1c ] Thread Creation, Control, and Cleanup Thread Scheduling Thread Synchronization Signal Handling [ POSIX.2 ] Command Interpreter Utility Programs [ Versions after 1997 ] After 1997, the Austin Group developed the POSIX revisions. The specifications are known under the name Single UNIX Specification, before they become a POSIX standard when formally approved by the ISO. [ POSIX.1-2001 ] POSIX.1-2001 or IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 equates to the Single UNIX Specification version 3 [ http://www.unix.org/version3/pr.html The Open Group announces completion of the joint revision to POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification 2009-07-26 January 30, 2002 The Open Group ] This standard consisted of: the Base Definitions, Issue 6, the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 6, the Commands and Utilities, Issue 6. [ POSIX.1-2001 (with two TCs) ] IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 involved a minor update of POSIX.1-2001. It incorporated two technical corrigenda. [ http://www.unix.org/version3/ieee_std.html IEEE Std 1003.1 2004 Unix.org 2009-07-26 ] Its contents are available on the web.

[ Controversies ] [ 512- vs 1024-byte blocks ] POSIX mandates 512-byte block sizes for the df and du utilities, reflecting the default size of blocks on disks. When Richard Stallman and the GNU team were implementing POSIX for the GNU operating system, they objected to this on the grounds that most people think in terms of 1024 byte (or 1 KiB ) blocks. The environmental variable POSIXLY_CORRECT was introduced to force the standards-compliant behaviour. [ GNU http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.announce/msg/6c6e20b57ddb1a82?pli%3D1 Announce Google Groups replica ] {. } The variable POSIX_ME_HARDER was also discussed [ http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/12/22/rms_interview.html?page%3D2 Freedom, Innovation, and Convenience: The RMS Interview Linuxdevcenter 2004-12-22 ] {. } and was implemented in a few packages [ http://www.google.com/codesearch?sa%3DN%26amp%3Bq%3DPOSIX_ME_HARDER%2B%2Blang%3Ac%26amp%3Bct%3Drr%26amp%3Bcs_r%3Dlang%3Ac packages implementing POSIX_ME_HARDER Google Code search ] {. } before being obsoleted by POSIXLY_CORRECT. [ POSIX-oriented operating systems ] Depending upon the degree of compliance with the standards, one can classify operating systems as fully or partly POSIX compatible. Certified products can be found at the IEEE&apos;s website. [ http://get.posixcertified.ieee.org/search_certprodlist.tpl?CALLER%3Dcert_prodlist.tpl IEEE POSIX Certification ] [ Fully POSIX-compliant ] The following operating systems conform (i.e., are 100% compliant) to one or more of the various POSIX standards.

Microsoft POSIX subsystem, an optional Windows subsystem. Partial POSIX-1 — no threads, no sockets. Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX enables full POSIX compliance for certain Microsoft Windows products. Windows NT-based operating systems up to Windows 2000 had a POSIX layer built into the operating system, and UNIX Services for Windows provided a UNIX-like operating environment. For Windows XP, UNIX Services for Windows must be installed to provide POSIX compatibility. The UNIX Subsystem is built in to the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista and 7, and cannot be added separately to the other editions. UWIN from AT &amp; T Research implements a POSIX layer on top of the Win32 APIs. MKS Toolkit [ POSIX for OS/2 ] Mostly POSIX compliant environments for OS/2 : emx+gcc – largely POSIX compliant [ POSIX for DOS ] Partially POSIX compliant environments for DOS include: emx+gcc – largely POSIX compliant DJGPP – partially POSIX compliant [ Compliant via compatibility feature ] The following are not officially certified as POSIX compatible, but they conform in large part to the standards by implementing POSIX support via some sort of compatibility feature, usually translation libraries, or a layer atop the kernel. Without these features, they are usually noncompliant.
