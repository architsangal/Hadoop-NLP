It opened off Broadway on May 17, 1971, and has played in various touring companies and revivals many times since, including a 2011 revival now playing on Broadway. Several cast album s have been released over the years and one of its songs, &quot; Day by Day &quot; from the original cast album, reached #13 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the summer of 1972. The structure of the musical is that of a series of parable s, based on the Gospel of Matthew (though three of the parables featured are recorded only in the Gospel of Luke ). These are then interspersed with a variety of modern music set primarily to lyrics from traditional hymns, with the passion of Christ treated briefly nearthe end of the performance. It started as a college project performed by students at Carnegie Mellon University and moved to La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in Greenwich Village. It was then re-scored for an off-Broadway production which became a long-running success. A junior one-act version with some songs removed has also been made under the title Godspell Junior. [ Background ] The show originated in 1970 as Tebelak&apos;s master&apos;s thesis project, under the direction of Lawrence Carra, at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A version was performed at Carnegie Mellon in 1970, with several of the cast members from the CMU Music Department. Tebelak then directed the show, with much of the student cast, for a two-week, ten performance run at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club (aka Cafe la Mama), New York City, opening February 24, 1971. It was brought to the attention of producers Edgar Lansbury (brother of Angela Lansbury ) and Joseph Beruh by Carnegie alumnus Charles Haid (associate producer), who wanted to open it Off-Broadway. { An Interview with Stephen Schwartz geocities.com, 1998 } The producers hired Stephen Schwartz, another alumnus of Carnegie Mellon&apos;s theater department, to write a new song score. Schwartz&apos;s songs incorporated a variety of musical styles, from pop to folk rock, gospel, and vaudeville. One song, &quot; By My Side &quot;, written by CMU students Jay Hamburger and Peggy Gordon, was kept from the original score. As with the original score, most of the non-Schwartz lyrics were from the Episcopal Hymnal. (See also Godspell (1971 Off-Broadway Cast).) All ten actors are on stage throughout the show. The word &quot; Gospel &quot; is derived from Anglo Saxon &quot; Gódspell &quot; (ca AD 1000), which means &quot; good word &quot;. { Joseph Bosworth, The Gothic and Anglo Saxon Gospells, John Russell Smith, 1874 } [ Characters ] The original cast defined the personalities of each character as the show was developed. Most of the characters&apos; names are simply the first name of the actor, so the characters are more easily identified by the song they sing. The actor cast as John the Baptist doubles later in the show as Judas Iscariot. [ Synopsis ] [ December 2011 ] [ Act One ] The show begins with the Voice of God declaring his supremacy: &quot; My name is Known: God and King. I am most in majesty, in whom no beginning may be and no end. &quot; The company enters and takes the role of various philosophers throughout the ages (Although many times this section of the play is excluded): Socrates, Thomas Aquinas, Leonardo da Vinci, Edward Gibbon, Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Luther, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Buckminster Fuller (In the revival, Gibbon, Luther, Nietzsche and Fuller were replaced by Galileo Galilei, Jonathan Edwards, Marianne Williamson, and L. Ron Hubbard ). They sing fragments of their respective philosophies — first as solos and then in cacophonous counterpoint — in &quot; Tower of Babble (Prologue) &quot;. In some productions, &quot; Tower of Babble &quot; is replaced by &quot; Beautiful City, &quot; which Jesus sings to open the show. In still other productions, the company cuts Tower of Babble and Beautiful City, opting to begin with &quot; Prepare Ye (The Way of the Lord) &quot;. In response to the philosophers, John the Baptist blows three notes on the shofar to call the community to order. He then beckons them to &quot; Prepare Ye (The Way of the Lord) &quot;, and baptizes the company (this can be done in various ways, aiming to be comical). Jesus comes, also to be baptized. John responds by, instead, asking to be baptized by Jesus. Jesus explains that it is not his place to baptize; that he has come to &quot; Save the People &quot;. In his first parable, Jesus explains to the company that he has come &quot; not to abolish the law and the prophets, but to complete. &quot; In the original production, the company donned clown makeup at this point. Subsequent productions may instead use some object —a pin, a scarf, a badge or a flower, for example —to denote that the company has become followers of Jesus. Jesus explains to the company that those who adhere to the law of God will earn the highest place in the Kingdom of God. He tells them the story of the widow and the Judge: God is a just jurist who will support those who cry out to him. The company begins to understand Jesus and his teachings, and they take it upon themselves to tell the story of the Pharisees and the tax gatherer praying in the temple. &quot; Every man who humbles himself shall be exalted! &quot; As Jesus teaches of the law regarding the offering of gifts at the altar, the company makes offerings —themselves. They are taught that to approach the altar of God, they must be pure of heart and soul. Then, they act out the story of a master and a servant who owes him a debt. The servant asks his master for pity in repaying the debt, and the master absolves it. The servant then turns to a fellow servant who &quot; owed him a few dollars &quot; and demands that it be paid in full. The master, hearing this, then condemns the servant to prison. Jesus explains the moral: &quot; Forgive your brothers from your heart. &quot; The member of the company telling the parable sings &quot; Day by Day &quot;, and the company joins in. After the song, Jesus teaches that if one part of you offends God, it is better to lose it than to have the whole of the body thrown into hell. The company then plays charades (in the current production, with members from the audience) to finish several statements posed by Jesus, including &quot; If a man sues you for your shirt... &quot; and &quot; If a man asks you to go one mile with him.... &quot;. Then, a cast member comes forward after charades saying, &quot; You wanna see a show? &quot; The company performs the Parable of the Good Samaritan in the form of a play-within-a-play. Jesus explains the need to &quot; love your enemies &quot;, and &quot; not make a show of religion before men. &quot; He goes on to say, &quot; God will reward a good deed done in secret. &quot; ( &quot; Shhh! It&apos;s a secret! &quot; ) The parable of Lazarus and the rich man is next tackled by the company, who are quickly learning how to work together. On earth, the rich man feasts, and Lazarus begs and is ignored. Upon dying, Lazarus is rewarded with Heaven, while the rich man is in Hell. We are told to &quot; Learn Your Lessons Well &quot;, or be faced with eternal damnation. When the rich man asks Abraham if he would send Lazarus back from the dead to warn his brothers of their impending doom, Abraham tells him no, and says, &quot; If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone should rise from the dead. &quot; Jesus teaches that no man can serve two masters —God and money. A member of the company tells a story of a man who spent a lifetime acquiring the good things in life, then dies before he has the time to enjoy them. She sings &quot; Bless the Lord, &quot; then Jesus tells them not to worry about tomorrow; &quot; Tomorrow will take care of itself. Today has problems of its own. &quot; In an antiphon ic chorus, the company recites the Beatitudes. Judas, however, directs the final beatitude regarding persecution at Jesus, and Jesus quickly changes the subject. ( &quot; Did I ever tell you that I used to read feet? &quot; ) However, with this Jesus persuades the company that it is &quot; All for the Best &quot;; heaven contains the ultimate reward. Judas sings a verse, and the two do a soft shoe and a vaudevillian joke. The company, and chorus if used, join in the final verse (sung in counterpoint) to bring the song to conclusion. This is followed by the parable of the Sower of the Seeds, which Jesus tells them represent the Word of God. &quot; All Good Gifts &quot; is sung to further illustrate the point. The action to this point, while amusing and entertaining, has been to do one thing —create from this rag-tag company a community of love and caring. At this point in the musical, they have formed this community and they now march as soldiers in the military, signifying their ability to think as one unit. With Jesus as the drill sergeant, they segue into the famous Parable of the Prodigal Son. They sing &quot; Light of the World &quot; about Christ&apos;s Light and how it should shine in each of us. Jesus thanks the audience for coming, and announces a ten-minute intermission. In the original production, the cast joined the audience for wine and bread. In the current Broadway production, wine is offered to the audience on-stage. [ Act Two ] The second act opens with one or more cast members singing &quot; Learn Your Lessons Well &quot;, to call the audience back into the hall. Another member of the community sings &quot; Turn Back, O Man &quot;, in which she implores mankind to give up its temporal pursuits and to turn to God. Jesus says, &quot; This is the beginning. &quot; At this point, several members of the community begin to question Jesus&apos;s authority, and he responds with yet another parable. He is asked, &quot; What is the greatest commandment? &quot; and responds, &quot; You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul... And the second is like it: &apos;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&apos; &quot; The Pharisees continue to question him, and he laments &quot; Alas for You &quot;, and calls them hypocrites. Members of the community gather and join in his song, and throw garbage at the Pharisees. Jesus predicts that he will not be seen for quite a while, while standing at the &quot; Wailing Wall &quot;, and predicts great wars and famines. He reminds us of the time of Noah, and teaches that faith can calm the storm. The community is told to &quot; keep awake, then. For the Son of Man will come at a time when you least expect it. &quot; One woman is cast out as an adulteress. Jesus says, &quot; Let the one of you who is faultless cast the first stone. &quot; Her accusers then bow their heads and walk away. Jesus walks over to her and asks, &quot; Woman...where are they now? Has no one condemned you? &quot; The woman answers, &quot; No one, sir. &quot; He tells her, &quot; Then nor shall I. You may go, but do not sin again. &quot; As she watches Jesus walk from her,she entreats him to remain &quot; By My Side &quot;. During this song, we see Judas foretell his upcoming betrayal of Jesus. In one of the lighter moments in the second act, Jesus tells how he will separate men as a shepherd separates his flock into sheep and goat s. The sheep will enter heaven while the goats must suffer eternal damnation. &quot; We Beseech Thee &quot; cry the goats, begging for mercy. After the song, the community reminds each other to take things &quot; Day By Day &quot;, as they remove their clown makeup (or other accoutrement). They assemble for the Last Supper, and Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him. Each member of the community asks, &quot; Is it I? &quot; ending with Judas who asks &quot; Rabbi...can you mean me? &quot;. Jesus tells him to do quickly what he must do, and Judas runs off. Jesus breaks the bread and shares the wine and tells his followers that they will dine together in the Kingdom of Heaven. He asks that they wait for him as he goes into the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. The band sings &quot; On the Willows &quot;, which is about what has been sacrificed. In the song, Jesus says goodbye to the company members. In the garden, Jesus implores God that if there is another way, to let the burden be lifted from his shoulders. He is tempted by Satan, but orders him away. Jesus returns to his followers to find them all asleep. Judas returns and kisses Jesus on the cheek, to bring him to be crucified. The community starts to attack Judas, while Jesus reminds them, &quot; He who lives by the sword, will die by the sword... This has all happened to fulfill what the Prophets have written. &quot; The &quot; Finale &quot; begins, loud and in B-minor, with Jesus being put upon an electric fence, representative of the cross described in the gospel of Matthew. Jesus wails, &quot; Oh, God, I&apos;m dying, &quot; and the community answers, &quot; Oh, God, You&apos;re dying. &quot; Jesus dies and the music comes to a rest. One woman sings &quot; Long Live God, &quot; joined on each phrase by another female voice. The men join in with &quot; Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord &quot; in counterpoint, as they remove Jesus from the fence and carry him out (either offstage or through the aisles of the auditorium). There is controversy over the fact that there is no obvious resurrection of Jesus present in the show, though some see the singing of &quot; Prepare Ye &quot; in the finale and/or the curtain call (where all including Jesus return to the stage) as representations of the resurrection. Some productions have placed the song &quot; Beautiful City &quot; after the finale to show the resurrection. [ Songs ] Act I Opening ‡ Prologue:Towers of Babble ‡ Prepare ye The Way of the Lord Save the People Day By Day Learn Your Lessons Well O Bless the Lord All for the Best All Good Gifts Light of the World Act II Learn Your Lessons Well (Reprise) ‡ Turn Back, O Man Alas for You By My Side Beautiful City † We Beseech Thee Day By Day (Reprise) On The Willows Finale ‡ These songs were not part of the original production, but are sometimes performed in contemporary productions † See notes below on &quot; Beautiful City &quot; [ &quot; Beautiful City &quot; ] &quot; Beautiful City &quot; was written in 1972 as part of the movie and re-written in 1993 after the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Its position in the film is directly after &quot; By My Side, &quot; which in turn follows directly on from &quot; Alas for You, &quot; omitting the parable in between. This provides a sequence where Jesus upturns the tables at the temple before the pharisees. Then, scared by what he has done, he walks off, followed by the disciples, who ask, &quot; Where are you going? Can you take me with you? &quot; and they are reunited with Jesus, and sing &quot; Beautiful City. &quot; Many theatrical directors choose to use it in place of the &quot; Day by Day &quot; reprise. &quot; Beautiful City &quot; has also been used at the very end of the play in an additional dialogue-free scene that depicts the Resurrection, which was not depicted in the original. In their Broadway Junior series — popular musicals edited to one act and appropriate for middle school — Music Theater International supplies &quot; Beautiful City &quot; as part of the show. This version contains much of the first act and very little of the second: &quot; By My Side &quot; is omitted entirely. &quot; Beautiful City &quot; is at a point in the beginning of the traditional second act, but followed quickly by the Last Supper, the Betrayal, and the Crucifixion. The 2011 Broadway revival places &quot; Beautiful City &quot; between &quot; We Beseech Thee &quot; and the Last Supper, sung as a slow ballad by Jesus to his followers.

The Toronto run had a cast drawn entirely from local performers instead of from a touring company. After an enthusiastic response from the audience, the show moved uptown to the Bayview Playhouse in Leaside after its scheduled run at the Royal Alex ended and ran until August 1973, setting what was then a record run of 488 performances. [ August 2010 ] The Toronto production provided the first regular acting jobs for several notable performers, including Victor Garber, Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Gilda Radner, Dave Thomas, and Martin Short, and the show&apos;s musical director Paul Shaffer.

[ Modern productions ] The original production of Godspell made the company a troupe of clowns who follow Jesus in an abandoned playground; subsequent productions have been set in museums, classrooms, on top of buildings, an apocalyptic world or in an abandoned theater. Since the setting is never explicitly stated in the text, directors frequently see this show as a chance to show off their creative abilities. In one such production, the setting was simply three construction scaffolds. In another, it was done with a wall, some steps, and a treasure chest. The setting has even been in a McDonald&apos;s restaurant. [ June 2010 ] Godspell was revived Off-Broadway at the York Theatre from August 2, 2000, to October 7, 2000. { Ehren, Christine. &quot; OB &apos;Godspell&apos; To Close Oct. 7, Transfer Expected &quot; playbill.com, September 21, 2000 } The 2000 national tour mounted by Stephen Schwartz&apos;s son Scott Schwartz set the play in a &quot; world of technology &quot;. In addition to new arrangements, &quot; The Good Samaritan &quot; story was &quot; an episode of a reality cop show. &quot; { Hirschman, Bill.

John-Michael Tebelak co-wrote the screenplay and served as the creative consultant. The song &quot; Beautiful City &quot; was written for and first included in the film, while the songs &quot; Prologue/Tower Of Babel &quot;, &quot; Learn Your Lessons Well &quot;, and &quot; We Beseech Thee &quot; were left out. Original cast members Robin Lamont, Gilmer McCormick, Joanne Jonas and Jeffrey Mylett also appear. [ In popular culture ] { David Byrd in the } { Cherry Lane Theatre &apos;&apos; } In the film Meet the Parents, Greg ( Ben Stiller ) recites &quot; Day by Day &quot; when asked to say grace over his first meal with the family. In the book The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy, Ford keeps a copy of Godspell&apos;s script in his bag to convince people he&apos;s an actor. In the film Wet Hot American Summer, &quot; Day by Day &quot; is performed at the camp talent show. At first, the other campers enjoy the performance, but at the end of the song, booing ensues when an image of the cross appears behind the performers. In the DVD commentary for the film, director David Wain noted that the booing was not directed at the cross but rather at the performance itself. On their album Jesus Freak, Christian rock band dc Talk has a cover version of &quot; Day by Day. &quot; On their album F♯A♯∞, the band Godspeed You! Black Emperor used a sample of the opening line of &quot; By My Side &quot; for the song &quot; Providence &quot;. In an episode of King of the Hill where Bobby Hill attends a high school, he is overjoyed to find that the play is being held, as it was banned from his middle school. In Scotland, PA, the characters sing &quot; Day by Day &quot; in a homage as to what people did in the 70&apos;s. In the novel How I Paid for College, the main character is starring as Jesus in a production of Godspell at his school. In an episode of Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, the employees of Harvey&apos;s law firm are so overjoyed at the seeming resurrection of their boss Phil (who had been killed off in the previous episode) that they break into a song which parodies Godspell, complete with costumes similar to those of the play. In an episode of &quot; So You Think You Can Dance (Season 4) &quot;, contestants Joshua Allen and Katee Shean dance a Broadway dance number set to &quot; All for the Best &quot;, choreographed by Tyce Diorio. In the novel &quot; Fall Musical, &quot; of the Drama Club series, the school play is Godspell. One character notes, &quot; As you know, it&apos;s about Jesus, but you don&apos;t have to be a Christian. Stephen Schwartz wrote it, and he&apos;s Jewish. Actually, so was Jesus. &quot; In Season Four Episode Eight of &quot; Ally McBeal &quot; the character of Rene, played by Lisa Nicole Carson sings &quot; Turn Back, O Man &quot; in a bar scene. [ Controversy ] The hippie garb that the cast wears has caused controversy. [ December 2011 ] In the 1999, &quot; Notes on the Script &quot;, Stephen Schwartz wrote, &quot; There are often misconceptions about the concept of the clown analogy in Godspell. For instance, sometimes it is misunderstood as the cast being &apos;hippies&apos; or &apos; flower child ren &apos;. The concept was derived by John-Michael Tebelak from a book by Harvey Cox, a professor at Harvard Divinity School, entitled Feast of Fools.
