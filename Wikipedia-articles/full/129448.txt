[ Cultural geography ] New London is thoroughly Midwestern, and the village&apos;s economy is closely tied to agriculture and manufacturing. Although well within the Great Lakes region (a sub region of the Midwest ) and arguably located at the center of the Rust Belt, significant influences from New England and the South have contributed to New London&apos;s cultural identity. The village was founded by settlers from Connecticut (and to a lesser extent other parts of the Northeast ) along with neighboring communities in the Firelands in the early nineteenth century. The village&apos;s New England heritage is most evident in its architecture, the names of local families, and the presence of a village green (a common characteristic of many cities and towns in Northern Ohio ). In the mid twentieth century at the climax of the manufacturing boom in the Great Lakes region, New London welcomed an influx of new residents from the Appalachian South - primarily Eastern Kentucky - to work in fields and factories locally and in nearby metropolitan Cleveland. Today, the influence of these Southerners is most evident in the hospitality and kindness of New London&apos;s residents, and the close-knit community that has grown up in the midst of such diversity.
