[ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of [ 14.4 sqmi ], of which [ 14.2 sqmi ] is land and [ 0.3 sqmi ], or 1.80%, is water. The landscape is largely hilly and wooded, and the borough&apos;s eastern boundary is contiguous with the Monongahela River three separate times. Much of the original landscape has been altered as a result of the historic dumping of steel mill byproducts such as slag and fly ash. Coal mining has also affected the flow and water quality of small streams. Land developers have produced more level ground by clean-filling ravines and other small parcels of land to improve the land usage. Toxic waste dump areas are meticulously monitored with water quality improvement with bioremediation successfully implemented. West Mifflin operates its own sewage treatment facility.
