The album failed to cross over into the mainstream and suffered a critical backlash. For example, Britt Robson of The Washington Post &quot; Struggle &quot; was a &quot; frequently awkward, too-obvious bid to exploit the commercial buzz Jay-Z created. &quot; [ BlackSmith Records, Liberation and Eardrum (2005-2009) ] In 2005, Kweli released a Mixtape-CD off of his newly formed Blacksmith Records. The project was called Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD, a title which is considered likely a response to the criticism of The Beautiful Struggle. The musical offering was generally considered to be a mixtape. However, some people regard &quot; Right About Now &quot; as an official album because of its availability through commercial sites and its release of two singles. &quot; Right About Now &quot; also lacks the DJ overlays often accompanied by mixtapes which makes the CD read more like an official album.
