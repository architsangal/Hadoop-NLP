Ashikaga Yoshimitsu { Kinkaku-ji, originated as the villa of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. } [ Ashikaga ] [ Ashikaga Yoshimitsu 足利 義満 September 25, 1358 – May 31, 1408 ] was the 3rd shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate who ruled from 1368 to 1394 during the Muromachi period of Japan. Yoshimitsu was the son of the second shogun Ashikaga Yoshiakira. { Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). } [ 18oNAAAAIAAJ Annales des empereurs du japon,p. 307. 307 ] &quot; The principal beneficiary of these achievements [the solid political and economic standing of the Muromachi Bakufu] was the adult Yoshimitsu, who assumed power in his own right upon the forced resignation of Hosokawa Yoriyuki in 1379 &quot; - The Ōnin War - H. Paul Varley: Page 58 &quot; The adult Yoshimitsu dominated Bakufu politics for nearly 30 years, from 1379 until his death in 1408. &quot; - The Ōnin War - H. Paul Varley: Page 61 In the year after the death of his father Yoshiakira in 1367, Yoshimitsu became Seii Taishogun at age 11. { Titsingh, } [ 18oNAAAAIAAJ p. 308. 308 ] Significant events shape the period during which Yoshimitsu was shogun: [ 18oNAAAAIAAJ p. 321. 321 ] 1368 – Yoshimitsu appointed shogun; Chōkei ascends southern throne.

[ Muromachi ] Yoshimitsu constructed his residence in the Muromachi section in the capital of Kyoto in 1378. As a result, in Japanese, the Ashikaga shogunate and the corresponding time period are often referred to as the Muromachi shogunate and Muromachi period. { Morton, W. Scott et al. (2004). } [ NC1bDncgKCQC Japan: Its History and Culture,p. 89. 89 ] Yoshimitsu resolved the rift between the Northern and Southern Court s in 1392, when he persuaded Go-Kameyama of the Southern Court to hand over the Imperial Regalia to Emperor Go-Komatsu of the Northern Court. Yoshimitsu&apos;s greatest political achievement was that he managed to bring about the end to Nanboku-cho fighting. This event had the effect of firmly establishing the authority of the Muromachi shogunate and suppressing the power of the regional age daimyo who might challenge that central authority. { Turnbull, Stephen. (2005). } [ EfevtkR8pJkC Samurai Commanders,p. 31. 31 ] Although Yoshimitsu retired in 1394 and his son was confirmed as the fourth shogun Ashikaga Yoshimochi, the old shogun didn&apos;t abandon any of his powers. Yoshimitsu continued to maintain authority over the shogunate until his death. { Titsingh, } [ 18oNAAAAIAAJ p. 325. 325 ] Yoshimitsu also played a major role in the genesis of Noh theatre, as the patron of Zeami Motokiyo, the actor considered to be Noh&apos;s founder. His close relationship with Zeami was not only based on his appreciation of Zeami&apos;s aesthetic sensibilities but also on the fact that Yoshimitu, known as an enthusiastic practitioner of Shudo, or Samurai pederasty, was infatuated with the young Zeami and took the young man as his lover. Yoshimitsu died suddenly in 1408 at age 50. { Turnbull, p. 32. } After his death, his retirement villa (near Kyoto) became Rokuon-ji, which today is famous for its three-storied, gold-leaf covered reliquary known as &quot; Kinkaku. &quot; So famous is this single structure, in fact, that the entire temple itself is often identified as the Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion. A statue of Yoshimitsu is found there today. { Pier, Garrett. (1915). } [ 3wBDAAAAIAAJ Temple Treasures of Japan,pp. 228–237. 228 ] [ Eras of Yoshimitsu&apos;s bakufu ] The years in which Yoshimitsu was shogun are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō. { Titsingh, } [ 18oNAAAAIAAJ pp. 308-321. 308 ] Nanboku-chō southern court Shōhei (1346–1370) Kentoku (1370–1372) Bunchū (1372–1375) Tenju (1375–1381) Kōwa (1381–1384) Genchū (1384–1393) Nanboku-chō northern court Ōan (1368–1375) Eiwa (1375–1379) Kōryaku (1379–1381) Eitoku (1381–1384) Shitoku (1384–1387) Kakei (1387–1389) Kōō (1389–1390) Meitoku (1390–1393)‡ Post-Nanboku-chō reunified court Meitoku (1393–1384)‡ Ōei (1394–1428) [ Notes ] [ 1 ] [ References ] Ackroyd, Joyce I.
