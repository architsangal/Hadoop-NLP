The tribe didn&apos;t turn over the area to the U.S. government until 1833. Fink and Walker also held the mail contract for the area&apos;s settlers.

Town in 1834, a native of Vermont, Town settled on the south east side of a [ 2000 acre km2 0 on ] wooded grove. The first cabin was built the next spring by Edward Butterfield on the site of present-day Paw Paw. This first house also held the village&apos;s first store and would eventually become the first structure in town to burn. During its earliest days the town was sectioned off into East, West and South Paw Paw, all of which became known as simply Paw Paw. In 1837 the village got its first postmaster, William Rodgers. Before Rodgers the nearest post office was 20 miles away in Somonauk, Illinois. Two years later, in 1839 a new road was constructed which allowed mail to be carried from Paw Paw to Princeton, Illinois. The first stage coach station (known as a &quot; Tavern &quot; ) was built along Chicago Road and operated by Isaac Balding. Balding operated the station until the railroad came to town several years later. { &quot; Paw Paw, &quot; Lee County Historical Society, The History of Lee County. Retrieved 28 June 2007.

American general Winfield Scott is credited with being the first person of European ancestry to discover the area. The area that Paw Paw is located in was home to more than one stand of Paw Paw trees and, thus, more than one settlement took the name Paw Paw. To avoid confusion the townspeople renamed the village Wyoming Township. The new name came from the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, where many of Paw Paw&apos;s earliest settlers originated. { Zeimetz, Lisa. &quot; Stephen Wright House, &quot; ( } { PDF ), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 1 April 2005, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.
