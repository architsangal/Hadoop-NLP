[ Infant education January 2010 Talk:Infant_education#Merge_to_Early_childhood_education ] [ December 2008 April 2011 ] Early childhood education (also early childhood learning and early education) refers to the formal teaching of young children by people outside the family or in settings outside the home. &quot; Early childhood &quot; is usually defined as before the age of normal schooling – five years in most nations, though the U.S. National Association for the Education of Young Children defines &quot; early childhood &quot; as before the age of eight. [ Background ] Early childhood education often focuses on children learning through play, based on the research and philosophy of Jean Piaget. This belief is centered on the &quot; power of play &quot;. It is thought that children learn more efficiently and gain more knowledge through play-based activities such as dramatic play, art, and social games. This theory plays stems children&apos;s natural curiosity and tendencies to &quot; make believe &quot;, mixing in educational lessons. [ Wenner Melinda 28 January 2009 http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id%3Dthe-serious-need-for-play The Serious Need for Play Scientific American ] Preschool education and kindergarten emphasize learning around the ages of 3–6 years. The terms &quot; day care &quot; and &quot; child care &quot; do not convey the educational aspects, although many childcare centers are now using more educational approaches. [ April 2011 ] The distinction between childcare centers and kindergartens has all but disappeared in countries that require staff in different early childhood facilities to have a teaching qualification. Researchers and early childhood educators both view the parents as an integral part of the early childhood education process.

Much of the first two years of life are spent in the creation of a child&apos;s first &quot; sense of self &quot;; most children are able to differentiate between themselves and others by their second year. This is a crucial part of the child&apos;s ability to determine how they should function in relation to other people. [ Oatley Keith Keltner Dacher Jenkins Jennifer M Understanding emotions 2007 Blackwell Publishing Malden, Massachusetts 978-1-4051-3103-2 211 2nd ] Early care must emphasize links to family, home culture, and home language by uniquely caring for each child. [ May 2012 ] Children who lacks sufficient nurturing, nutrition, interaction with a parent or caregiver, and stimulus during this crucial period may be left with developmental deficits, as has been reported in Russian and Romanian orphanage s.

There is a false belief that more hours of formal education for a very young child confers greater benefits than a balance between formal education and family time. A systematic, international review suggests that the benefits of early childhood education come from the experience of participation; more than 2.5 hours a day does not greatly add to child development outcomes, especially when it detracts from other experiences and family contact.

The approach aims to involve children in acquiring competence via learning through discovery. [ Shapiro E.

Intelligence is demonstrated through motor activity with limited use of symbols, including language; the infant’s knowledge of the world is primarily based on physical interactions and experiences. Preoperational The second stage occurs between the ages of 2–7 years. Intelligence is increasingly demonstrated through the use of symbols; memory and imagination are developed as language use matures. The typical thought process is nonlogical, nonreversible, and egocentric. Concrete operations This developmental state occurs between ages 7 and 12 (approximate). During this stage—characterized by conservation of number, length, liquid, mass, weight, area, and volume—intelligence is increasingly demonstrated through logical and systematic manipulation of symbols relating to concrete objects. Thinking becomes operational, reversible, and less egocentric. Formal operations This final stage of cognitive development takes place from ages 12 and beyond. During this stage, intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts. Thinking becomes abstract, hypothetical, and, early on, egocentric. It is believed that the majority of people never complete this stage. [ Emotional development ] Emotional development concerns the child&apos;s increasing awareness and control of their feelings and how they react to them in a given situation. [ Social development ] Social development concerns the child&apos;s identity, relationships with others, and understanding of their place within a social environment. [ Benefits of early childhood education ] In Ypsilanti, Michigan, 3- and 4-year-olds from low-income families who were randomly assigned to a group that did not receive preschool education were five times more likely to have become chronic lawbreakers by age 27 than those who did receive it.
