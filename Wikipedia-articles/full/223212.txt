It became internationally notorious when, on November 18, 1978, 918 people died in the settlement as well as in a nearby airstrip and in Georgetown, Guyana&apos;s capital. The name of the settlement became synonymous with the incidents at those locations. A total of 909 Temple members died in Jonestown, all but two from apparent cyanide poisoning, in an event termed &quot; revolutionary suicide &quot; by Jones andsome members on an audio tape of the event and in prior discussions. This includes over 200 murdered children. The poisonings in Jonestown followed the murder of five others by Temple members at a nearby Port Kaituma airstrip. The victims included United States Congressman Leo Ryan. Four other Temple members died in Georgetown at Jones&apos;s command. To the extent the actions in Jonestown were viewed as a mass murder, it was the largest such event in modern history and resulted in the largest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the events of September 11, 2001. { Rapaport, Richard. &quot; Jonestown and City Hall slayings eerily linked in time and memory. &quot; San Francisco Chronicle.

Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982. ISBN 0-525-24136-1. p. 237. } The plan listed various options, including fleeing to Canada or to a &quot; Caribbean missionary post &quot;, such as Barbados or Trinidad. For its &quot; Caribbean missionary post &quot;, the Temple quickly chose Guyana. The Temple then researched Guyana&apos;s economy and extradition treaties with the United States. In October 1973, the directors of the Peoples Temple passed a resolution to establish an agricultural mission there. The Temple chose Guyana, in part, because of its socialist politics, which were also moving further to the left during the selection process. { &apos;&apos;Paranoia And Delusions&apos;&apos;, Time Magazine, December 11, 1978 } Former Temple member Tim Carter stated that the reasons for choosing Guyana were the Temple&apos;s view of creeping fascism, the perceived dominance of multinational corporation s on the government, and perceived racism in the U.S. government. { Carter, Tim. &apos;&apos;Interview on Oregon Public Broadcasting Radio (Clip#3)&apos;&apos;, 9 April 2007. } Carter said the Temple concluded that Guyana, a predominantly Indian, English -speaking socialist country, would afford black members of the Temple a peaceful place to live. Later, Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham stated that what may have attracted Jones was that &quot; he wanted to use cooperatives as the basis for the establishment of socialism, and maybe his idea of setting up a commune meshed with that. &quot; Jones also thought it was important that Guyana&apos;s leadership consisted of several black leaders and that the country was small and poor enough for Jones to easily obtain influence and official protection. In 1974, after Jones and Temple members traveled to an area of Northwest Guyana with Guyanese officials, the Temple and Guyanese officials negotiated a lease of over 3,800 acres (15.4  km²) of jungle land from the Guyanese government. { &apos;&apos;Timeline: The Life and Death of Jim Jones&apos;&apos;.

In 1976, Guyana finally approved the lease it had negotiated (retroactive to April 1974) with the Temple for the over [ 3000 acre km2 ] of land in Northwest Guyana on which Jonestown was located. { Reiterman, Tim, Tom Reiterman, and John Jacobs. Raven: The Untold Story of Reverend Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982. ISBN 0-525-24136-1. pages 275. } In 1974, Guyanese government officials granted the Temple permission to import certain items &quot; duty free. &quot; Later payoffs to Guyanese customs officials helped safeguard shipments of firearms and drugs through Guyanese customs. { Reiterman, Tim, and John Jacobs. } { Raven: The Untold Story of Rev.

Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982. ISBN 0-525-24136-1. page 337. } Jones reached an agreement to guarantee that Guyana would permit Temple members&apos; mass migration. To do so, he stated that Temple members were &quot; skilled and progressive &quot;, showed off an envelope he claimed had $500,000 and stated that he would invest most of the church&apos;s assets in Guyana. Guyanese immigration procedures were also compromised to inhibit the departure of Temple defectors and curtail the visas of Temple opponents.

In that meeting, Dymally agreed to pass on the message to the U.S. State Department that socialist Guyana wanted to keep an open door to cooperation with the United States. Dymally followed up that meeting with a letter to Burnham stating that Jones was &quot; one of the finest human beings &quot; and that Dymally was &quot; tremendously impressed &quot; by his visit to Jonestown. Temple members took pains to stress their loyalty to Burnham&apos;s Peoples National Congress Party. [ Hall, John R.

[ Jonestown life after mass migration ] Many members of the Peoples Temple believed that Guyana would be, as Jones promised, a paradise, or a utopia. [ Hall, John R.

Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982. ISBN 0-525-24136-1. p. 390-2. } After Jones arrived, Jonestown life significantly changed. Entertaining movies from Georgetown that the pioneers had watched were eliminated in favor of propaganda shorts on Soviet life provided by the Soviet embassy and documentaries on problems such as elderly life in the U.S. and returning Vietnam veterans&apos; adjustment to civilian life. Bureaucratic requirements after Jones&apos; arrival sapped labor resources for other needs. Buildings fell into disrepair and weeds encroached on fields. School study and night time lectures for adults turned to Jones&apos; discussions about revolution and enemies, with lessons focusing on Soviet alliances, Jones&apos; crises and the purported &quot; mercenaries &quot; of Timothy Stoen. For the first several months, Temple members worked six days a week, from approximately 6:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., with an hour for lunch. { Reiterman, Tim, and John Jacobs. } { Raven: The Untold Story of Rev.

In addition to Soviet documentaries, conspiracy theory movies such as Executive Action, written by Temple attorneys Mark Lane and Donald Freed, and The Parallax View (incorrectly attributed by Jones to Lane and Freed) were screened and minutely dissected by Jones as primers on the &apos;true nature&apos; of the Temple&apos;s capitalist enemies. { &quot; FBI Summaries of Peoples Temple Tapes Q 155, Q 160, Q 190, Q 198, Q 200, Q 203 and Q 242. &quot; Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple.

ISBN 0-88946-860-5. p. 292. } All voice communications with San Francisco and Georgetown were transmitted using this radio, from mundane supply orders to confidential Temple business. The FCC cited the Temple for technical violations and for using amateur frequencies for commercial purposes. Because shortwave radio was Jonestown&apos;s only effective means of non-postal communication, the Temple felt that the FCC&apos;s threats to revoke its operators&apos; licenses threatened Jonestown&apos;s existence. { Moore, Rebecca. A Sympathetic History of Jonestown. Lewiston: E. Mellen Press. ISBN 0-88946-860-5. p. 293. } Jonestown, being on poor soil, was not self-sufficient and had to import large quantities of commodities such as wheat. Temple members lived in small communal houses, some with walls woven from Troolie palm, and ate meals which reportedly consisted of nothing more on some days than rice, beans, greens and sometimes meat sauce and eggs (more on others).

His house reportedly held a small refrigerator, containing, at times, eggs, meat, fruit, salads and soft drinks. Medical problems, such as severe diarrhea and high fevers, struck half the community in February 1978. Although Jonestown contained no dedicated prison and no form of capital punishment, various forms of punishment were used against members considered to be serious disciplinary problems. Methods included imprisonment in a 6 x 4 x 3-foot (1.8 x 1.2 x 0.9m) plywood box and forcing children to spend a night at the bottom of a well, sometimes upside-down. For some members who attempted to escape, drugs such as Thorazine, sodium pentathol, chloral hydrate, Demerol and Valium were administered in an &quot; extended care unit. &quot; { King, Peter. &quot; How Jones used drugs. &quot; San Francisco Examiner. 28 December 1978.

After several exchanges in which Jones argued that a Soviet exodus would not be possible, along with reactions by other temple members hostile to Miller, Miller backed down.

In response to reactions of seeing the poison take effect on others, Jones counseled, &quot; Die with a degree of dignity. Lay down your life with dignity; don&apos;t lay down with tears and agony. &quot; He also said, &quot; I tell you, I don&apos;t care how many screams you hear, I don&apos;t care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to ten more days of this life.

Brothers Tim and Mike Carter, 30 years old and 20 years old respectively, and Mike Prokes, 31, were given luggage containing $550,000 in US currency, $130,000 in Guyanese currency and an envelope, which they were told to deliver to Guyana’s Soviet Embassy, in Georgetown. The envelope contained two passports and three instructional letters, the first of which was to Feodor Timofeyev of the Embassy of the Soviet Union in Guyana, stating: [ Dear Comrade Timofeyev, The following is a letter of instructions regarding all of our assets that we want to leave to the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Enclosed in this letter are letters which instruct the banks to send the cashiers checks to you. I am doing this on behalf of Peoples Temple because we, as communists, want our money to be of benefit for help to oppressed peoples all over the world, or in any way that your decision-making body sees fit. &quot; Letter to Feodor Timofeyev. &quot; Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple.

It is unknown how they were supposed to reach Georgetown, [ 150 mi km ] away, since the boat had been sent away by Temple leadership earlier that day. Just before the start of the final meeting in the pavilion, lawyers Charles Garry and Mark Lane were told that the people were angry at them. The lawyers were escorted to a house used to accommodate visitors. According to the lawyers, they talked their way past armed guards and made it to the jungle, before eventually arriving in Port Kaituma. { Reiterman, Tim and John Jacobs. } { Raven: The Untold Story of Rev. Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982. ISBN 0-525-24136-1. pp 540-542. } While in the jungle near the settlement, they heard gunshots.

Odell Rhodes, 36, a Jonestown teacher and craftsman, volunteered to fetch a stethoscope and hid under a building. Stanley Clayton, 25, a kitchenworker and cousin of Huey P. Newton, tricked security guards and ran into the jungle. The fifth survivor, a 5 year old boy known only as &quot; Michael &quot;, escaped by hiding in the surrounding forest.

ISBN 0-525-24136-1. pp 580. } [ Medical examinations ] The only medical doctor to initially examine the scene at Jonestown was Guyanese Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Leslie Mootoo. Mootoo visually examined over 200 bodies and later told a Guyanese coroner&apos;s jury that he saw needle marks on at least 70. However, no determination was made as to whether those injections initiated the introduction of poison or whether they were so-called &quot; relief &quot; injections to quicken death and reduce suffering from convulsions from those who had previously taken poison orally. Mootoo and American pathologist Dr. Lynn Crook determined that cyanide was present in some of the bodies, while analysis of the contents of the vat revealed several tranquilizers as well as potassium cyanide and potassium chloride. Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. { &apos;&apos;Guyana Inquest - Interviews of Cecil Roberts &amp; Cyril Mootoo&apos;&apos;. Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University. } Mootoo concluded that the gunshot wound to Annie Moore could not have been self-inflicted, though Moore had also ingested a lethal dose of cyanide. Guyanese authorities waived their requirement for autopsies in the case of unnatural death. Doctors in the United States performed autopsies on only seven bodies, including those of Jim Jones, Dr. Lawrence Schact, Annie Moore and Carolyn Layton. Annie Moore and Carolyn Layton were selected among those autopsied, in part, because of the urging of the Moore family, including the two victims&apos; sister, Rebecca Moore, who was not a Temple member herself. { &quot; Last Rites. &quot; Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple.

The above bank accounts are located in the Bank of Nova Scotia, Nassau, Bahamas. Please be sure that these assets do get to the USSR. I especially request that none of these are allowed to get into the hands of my adopted daughter, Suzanne Jones Cartmell.

Jones. { &quot; Letter from Marceline Jones. &quot; Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University. } Annie Moore left a note, which in part stated: &quot; I am at a point right now so embittered against the world that I don&apos;t know why I am writing this. Someone who finds it will believe I am crazy or believe in the barbed wire that does NOT exist in Jonestown. &quot; { &quot; Last Words - Annie Moore. &quot; Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University. } The last line ( &quot; We died because you would not let us live in peace. &quot; ) is written in different color ink. No other specific reference is made to the events of the day. Moore also wrote, &quot; JONESTOWN—the most peaceful, loving community that ever existed. &quot; In addition she stated, &quot; JIM JONES—the one who made this paradise possible—much to the contrary of the lies stated about Jim Jones being a power-hungry sadistic, mean person who thought he was God—of all things. &quot; And &quot; His hatred of racism, sexism, elitism, and mainly classism, is what prompted him to make a new world for the people—a paradise in the jungle. The children loved it. So did everyone else. &quot; Another note, found 25 years later, was buried among reams of unrelated paperwork. The document, titled &quot; Last Words &quot;, unsigned, was attributed most likely to Richard Tropp. { &quot; Last Words - Richard Tropp. &quot; Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University. } The note contained references to the events of the last day: We did not want it this way. All was going well as Ryan completed [his] first day here. Then a man tried to attack him, unsuccessfully at some time, several set out into jungle wanting to overtake Ryan, aide, and others who left with him. They did, and several killed. When we heard this, we had no choice. We would be taken. We have to go as one, we want to live as Peoples Temple, or end it. We have chosen. It is finished.

Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982. ISBN 0-525-24136-1. page 534-8. } Dwyer was grazed by one bullet in his buttock during the airstrip shootings. It took several hours before the ten wounded and others in their party gathered themselves together. Most of them spent the night in a café. The more seriously wounded slept in a small tent on the airfield. A Guyanese government plane arrived the following morning to evacuate the wounded. Five teenaged members of the Parks and Bogue families, with one boyfriend, followed the instructions of defector Gerald Parks to hide in the adjacent jungle until help arrived and their safety was assured. { Reiterman, Tim, and John Jacobs. } { Raven: The Untold Story of Rev. Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982. ISBN 0-525-24136-1. page 566-67. } Thereafter those members were lost for three days in the jungle and nearly died. Guyanese soldiers eventually found them. Military personnel evacuating bodies from Jonestown After escaping Jonestown, Odell Rhodes arrived in Port Kaituma on the night of November 18, 1978. That night Stanley Clayton stayed with a local Guyanese family and travelled to Port Kaituma the next morning. The Carter brothers and Michael Prokes were put into protective custody in Port Kaituma. They were later released in Georgetown. Rhodes, Clayton and the two lawyers (Garry and Lane) were also brought to Georgetown. Michael Prokes committed suicide on March 14, 1979, four months after the Jonestown incident. { &quot; Statement of Michael Prokes. &quot; Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple. San Diego State University: Jonestown Project. Accessed 22 September 2007. } Larry Layton, who had fired a gun at several people aboard the Cessna, was originally found not guilty of attempted murder in a Guyanese court, employing the defense that he was &quot; brainwashed &quot;. { Bishop, Katherine. &quot; 1978 CULT FIGURE GETS LIFE TERM IN CONGRESSMAN&apos;S JUNGLE SLAYING. &quot; New York Times. March 4, 1987. } Layton could not be tried in the United States for the attempted murders of Vern Gosney, Monica Bagby, the Cessna pilot and Dale Parks on Guyanese soil and was, instead, tried under a federal statute against assassinating members of Congress and internationally protected people (Ryan and Dwyer). He was convicted of conspiracy and of aiding and abetting the murder of Congressman Leo Ryan and of the attempted murder of Richard Dwyer. Paroled in 2002, he is the only person ever to have been held criminally responsible for the events at Jonestown. { Coleman, Loren. The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow&apos;s Realities. 2004. ISBN 1-4165-0554-7 } The event was one of the stories most heavily covered by the media [ March 2011 ] and photographs pertaining to it adorned newspaper and magazine covers for months after its occurrence, including being labeled &quot; cult of death &quot; by Time and Newsweek magazines. In February 1979, 98% of Americans polled said that they had heard of the tragedy. { Hall, John R. Gone from the Promised Land: Jonestown in American Cultural History. 1989.

Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982.

[ Former site ] Now deserted, the compound at Jonestown was first tended by the Guyanese government following the deaths. The government then allowed its re-occupation by Hmong refugees from Laos for a few years in the early 1980s. { &quot; What happened to Jonestown? &quot; Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple. San Diego State University: Jonestown Project. 2007-03-08 } The buildings and grounds were looted by local Guyanese people, but were not taken over because of their association with the mass killing. The buildings were mostly destroyed by a fire in the mid-1980s, after which the ruins were left to decay and be reclaimed by the jungle. During a visit in 1998 to film a segment for the ABC news show 20/20, Jim Jones, Jr. discovered the rusting remains of an oil drum near the former entrance to the Pavilion. { Smith, Gary. &quot; Escaping Jonestown. &quot; Sports Illustrated. CNN.com. 24 December 2007. } Jones recognized the drum, originally adapted for use during meal times, as the drum used for drink mixtures used during the &quot; white night &quot; exercises, and which he believed was used to hold the poison and Flavor Aid liquid used on November 18, 1978. In 2003, with the help of Gerry Gouveia, a pilot involved with the Jonestown Massacre cleanup, a television crew filming a special for the 25th anniversary of the event returned to the original site of Jonestown with the intent to uncover any remaining artifacts. { Guyana TV (2003), &quot; Lets Talk &quot;, &apos;&apos;Jonestown, 25 Years Later (clip #2)&apos;&apos;, including interview with pilot Gerry Gouveia and visit to former Jonestown site. } Although covered with dense vegetation, after searching for several hours the team uncovered a standing cassava mill (possibly the largest remaining structure), the remains of a tractor (speculated as the same tractor used by the airstrip shooters), a generator, a filing cabinet, an overturned truck near the site of Jim Jones&apos; house (claimed to be his favorite vehicle by Gouveia), a fuel pump, and other smaller miscellaneous items. The former pilot also led the team to the site where the pavilion once was, and they found the remains of a steel drum, an organ, and a bed of daisies growing where the bodies had once lain. { Guyana TV (2003), &quot; Lets Talk &quot;, &apos;&apos;Jonestown, 25 Years Later (clip #3)&apos;&apos;, including interview with pilot Gerry Gouveia and visit to former Jonestown site. } In 2011, a local man asked the government to make the site a tourist attraction { CBC Radio 1 &quot; Dispatches &quot;, November 24, 2011, }.
