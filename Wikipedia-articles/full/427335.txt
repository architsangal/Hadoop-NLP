I have given advance notice of this point of order to the Member in question. During Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions earlier, Mr James Gray directed a racist remark towards my hon. Friend Mr Bain. What steps can you take to protect Members of the House from the racist views espoused by Mr James Gray, and will you now ask him to apologise? &quot;. Gray responded &quot; Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I cannot imagine what sedentary remark the hon. Gentleman may have heard, but I am certain that had it been out of order in any shape, size or form, Mr Speaker, who was then in the Chair, would have picked me up on it. Further to that, as a Scot born, bred and educated, who never left the borders of Scotland until the age of 21, I think that unlike [Thomas Docherty], I have the highest respect and love for my native heath. I would never say a single word against it. &quot; { http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-12-09b.538.0 &amp; s=speaker:10240#g538.4 } [ Personal life ] Gray married Sarah Ann Beale in 1980, and they have two sons and a daughter.
