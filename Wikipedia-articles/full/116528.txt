[ Glenn Dale Fire Association ] [ December 2011 ] [ Glenn Dale Fire Association ] The Glenn Dale Fire Association was formed to serve as a Volunteer Fire Department for the Glenn Dale area in 1928. Prior to that, there was no organized fire protection available for quite some distance around. The first fire engine was a homemade Model T Ford, which was kept in a barn behind Jake Willett&apos;s store. In the first year, the new fire department responded to a handful of emergency calls, most of which were brush and woods fires. The fire department&apos;s response area was very loosely defined, and they would go wherever they were called. A &quot; real &quot; fire station was constructed in 1929, and a second truck was purchased, and like the first was converted into a firefighting vehicle by the firemen themselves. The population of the Glenn Dale area then was around 300-350 people spread over about [ 20 sqmi km2 ]. Inevitably, growth spread thru the area, the firemen became busier, and they acquired more and better equipment. The first ambulance service was started in 1930 by some of the fire department members, and quickly became an important part of the department. The Glenn Dale Fire Association has over 95 members and responds to approximately 3,800 calls annually. Today they operate highly specialized apparatus and equipment that the founders of the department never dreamed of. [ Glenn Dale Hospital ] The Glenn Dale Hospital [ Glenn Dale Hospital ] Glenn Dale Hospital was a tuberculosis sanatorium. It is a large facility, consisting of 23 buildings on [ 210 acre km2 ], that was built in 1934 and closed in 1982 due to asbestos. Though it is now closed and will be eventually demolished, for decades it was an important public health institution near Washington, D.C. Park Police patrol the hospital grounds regularly. The hospital was featured in an award-winning Washington Post Magazine article, &quot; Quarantined, &quot; on Dec. 10, 2006, by Leah Y. Latimer, former staff writer and author. The article detailed Latimer&apos;s mother&apos;s hospitalization there in the 1950s and the emotional fall-out for their family from then to the present. Latimer gave a lecture on the grounds of Glenn Dale on October 4, 2008. It was the first time the public was allowed on the grounds in almost 30 years. The unadvertised event drew more than 150 people. Latimer said she plans more lectures around the area, based on her continuing research and 110+ interviews. { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Dale_Hospital } The hospital was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.
