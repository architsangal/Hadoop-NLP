During the Yayoi period, permanent habitation on the plains grew as rice farming became popular. By the Kofun period, Osaka developed into a hub port connecting the region to the western part of Japan.

The place that became the modern city was by this time called Naniwa. This name, and derived forms, are still in use for districts in central Osaka such as Naniwa (浪速) and Namba (難波). { The name was also historically written 浪華 or 浪花, with the same pronunciation. These are uncommon today but still used sometimes. } Although the capital was moved to Asuka (in Nara Prefecture today) in 655, Naniwa remained a vital connection, by land and sea, between Yamato (modern day Nara Prefecture ), Korea, and China.

Planel The constructed past: experimental archaeology, education, and the public Routledge in association with English Heritage London 1999 68 0-415-11768-2 ] In 744, Naniwa once again became the capital by order of Emperor Shōmu. Naniwa ceased to be the capital in 745, when the Imperial Court moved back to Heijō-kyō (now Nara ). The seaport function was gradually taken over by neighboring lands by the end of Nara period, but it remained a lively center of river, channel, and land transportation between Heian-kyō (Kyoto today) and other destinations. [ Heian to Edo period ] In 1496, the Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist sect set up their headquarters in the heavily fortified Ishiyama Hongan-ji on the site of the old Naniwa imperial palace. Oda Nobunaga started a siege of the temple in 1570. After a decade, the monks finally surrendered, and the temple was razed, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi constructed Osaka Castle in its place. Osaka was, for a long time, Japan&apos;s most important { Osaka city } [ May 2010 ] economic center, with a large percentage of the population belonging to the merchant class (see Four divisions of society ). Over the course of the Edo period (1603–1867), Osaka grew into one of Japan&apos;s major cities and returned to its ancient role as a lively and important port. Its popular culture { A Guide to the Ukiyo-e Tokyo national museum } [ April 2011 ] was closely related to ukiyo-e depictions of life in Edo. By 1780 Osaka was sponsoring a vibrant cultural life, as typified by its famous Kabuki theaters and Banraku puppet theaters. { C. Andrew Gerstle, Kabuki Heroes on the Osaka Stage 1780-1830 (2005) } In 1837, Ōshio Heihachirō, a low-ranking samurai, led a peasant insurrection in response to the city&apos;s unwillingness to support the many poor and suffering families in the area. Approximately one-quarter of the city was razed before shogunal officials put down the rebellion, after which Ōshio killed himself. [ Ebrey Patricia Buckley; Walthall, Anne; Palais, James B.

Jippenisha Ikku in 1802 depicted Osakans as stingy almost beyond belief. In 1809 the derogatory term &quot; Kamigata zeeroku &quot; was used by Edo residents to characterize inhabitants of the Osaka region in terms of calculation, shrewdness, lack of civic spirit, and the vulgarity of Osaka dialect. Edo writers aspired to samurai culture, and saw themselves as poor but generous, chaste, and public spirited. Edo writers by contrast saw &quot; zeeroku &quot; as obsequious apprentices, stingy, greedy, gluttonous, and lewd. To some degree Osaka residents are stigmatized by Tokyo observers in much the same way down to the present, especially in terms of gluttony. As a famous saying has it, &quot; Osaka wa kuidaore &quot; (Osaka people eat &apos;til they drop). { Richard Torrance, &quot; Literacy and Literature in Osaka, 1890-1940, &quot; The Journal of Japanese Studies 31#1 (Winter 2005), pp. 27-60 } [ Modern Osaka ] The modern municipality was established [ http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/about/historical.html Osaka city Osaka-info.jp 2010-05-05 ] in 1889 by government ordinance, with an initial area of 15  km², overlapping today&apos;s Chūō and Nishi wards. Later, the city went through three major expansions to reach its current size of 222  km². Osaka was the industrial center most clearly defined in the development of capitalism in Japan. The rapid industrialization attracted many Korean immigrants, who set up a life apart for themselves. { Chisato Hotta, &quot; The Construction of the Korean Community in Osaka between 1920 and 1945: A Cross-Cultural Perspective. &quot; PhD dissertation U. of Chicago 2005. 498 pp. DAI 2005 65(12): 4680-A.

In Japan it was here that municipal government first introduced a comprehensive system of poor relief, copied in part from British models. Osaka policymakers stressed the importance of family formation and mutual assistance as the best way to combat poverty. This minimized the cost of welfare programs. { Kingo Tamai, &quot; Images of the Poor in an Official Survey of Osaka, 1923-1926. &quot; Continuity and Change 2000 15(1): 99-116.

Many people fled and most of the industrial districts were severely damaged. However the city quickly rebuilt its infrastructure after 1945 and regained its status as a major industrial and cultural center. { Carola Hein, Jeffry M. Diefendorf, and Ishida Yorifusa, eds, Rebuilding Urban Japan after 1945. (2003). } [ Derivation of name ] &quot; Osaka &quot; literally means &quot; large hill &quot; or &quot; large slope. &quot; It is unclear when this name gained prominence over Naniwa, but the oldest usage of the name dates back to a 1496 text. Osaka, now written 大阪, was formerly written using a different second kanji as 大坂 prior to 1870. At the time, the partisans for the Meiji Restoration wished to avoid the second kanji being implicitly read as &quot; 士反, &quot; meaning samurai rebellion. The old writing is still in very limited use to emphasize history, but the second kanji 阪 is now universally considered referring to Osaka city and prefecture only, to distinguish it from homonyms in other Japanese prefectures. [ Geography and climate ] [ Geography ] The city of Osaka has its west side open to Osaka Bay. It is otherwise completely surrounded by more than ten smaller cities, all of them in Osaka Prefecture, with one exception: the city of Amagasaki, belonging to Hyōgo Prefecture, in the northwest. The city occupies a larger area (about 13%) than any other city or village within Osaka Prefecture. When the city was established in 1889, the city occupied roughly what today are the wards of Chuo and Nishi, with only [ 15.27 km2 acre 0 ] size, and grew into today&apos;s [ 222.30 km2 acre 0 ] over several expansions. The biggest leap was in 1925, when [ 126.01 km2 acre 0 ] was claimed through an expansion. The highest point in Osaka is in Tsurumi-ku at [ 37.5 m ft 1 ] Tokyo Peil, and the lowest point is in Nishiyodogawa-ku at [ -2.2 m ft 1 ] Tokyo Peil. { http://www.city.osaka.jp/keikakuchousei/toukei/G000/Gyh19/Gb00/Gb00.html } [ Climate ] Osaka belongs to the humid subtropical climate zone ( Köppen Cfa), with four distinct seasons. Its winters are generally mild, with January being the coldest month having an average high of [ 9.3 °C 0 on ]. The city rarely sees snowfall during the winter. Spring in Osaka starts off mild, but ends up being hot and humid. It also tends to be Osaka’s wettest season, with the Tsuyu or rainy season occurring between late May to early July. Summers are very hot and humid. In the months of July and August, the average daily high temperature approaches [ 35 °C 0 on ], while average nighttime temperatures typically hover around [ 25 °C 0 on ]. Fall in Osaka sees a cooling trend, with the early part of the season resembling summer while the latter part of fall resembling winter. { Japan Meteorological Agency.

Minami is home to the Namba, Shinsaibashi, and Dōtonbori shopping districts. The entertainment district around Dōtonbori Bridge with its famous giant mechanical crab, Triangle Park, and Amerikamura ( &quot; America Village &quot; ) is in Minami. In Yodoyabashi and Honmachi, between Kita and Minami, is the traditional business area where courts and national/regional headquarters of major banks are located. The newer business area is in the Osaka Business Park located nearby Osaka Castle. Business districts have also formed around the secondary rail termini, such as Tennoji Station and Kyobashi Station. “The 808 bridges of Naniwa” was an expression in old Japan for awe and wonder, an adage known across the land. “808” was a large number which symbolized the idea of “uncountable”. In the Edo period there were only about 200 bridges. Since Osaka is crossed by a number of rivers and canals, many bridges were built with specific names, and the areas surrounding the bridges were often referred to by the names of the bridges, too. Some of the waterways, such as the Nagahori canal, have been filled in, while others still remain. { More About Osaka, Osaka City Government } In 1925, there were actually 1629 bridges in Osaka but with the filling in of canals and rivers, as of April 2003, the number has dropped to 872, 760 of which are currently managed by Osaka City.
