(divorced) } Reginald Gardiner (27 February 1903 – 7 July 1980) was an English -born actor in film and television and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in Britain. His parents wanted him to be an architect and he studied at it but he wanted to be an actor and eventually got his way. He started as a super on stage and eventually became well known on the West End stage. He was also well known to wireless listeners and was known on air for his amusing train and car noises. Gardiner started film work in crowd scenes, making his big film break in 1926 in the silent film The Lodger, by Alfred Hitchcock. Moving to Hollywood, he was cast in numerous roles, often as a British butler. One of his most famous roles was that of Schultz in Charlie Chaplin &apos;s The Great Dictator. On October 4, 1956, Gardiner appeared with Greer Garson as the first two guest stars in the series premiere of NBC &apos;s The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.

His last major role was alongside Phyllis Diller in her short-lived ABC series, The Pruitts of Southampton (1966–67). He also recorded a curious and eccentric classic called &quot; Trains &quot; which was regularly played on a British radio program called Children&apos;s Favourites during the 1950s. This consisted of Gardiner, sounding slightly tipsy, reciting a monologue about steam railway engines (which he claimed were &apos;livid beasts&apos;) and impersonating both the engines themselves and the sound of trains running on the track. This latter he famously characterised as &apos;diddly-dee, diddly-dum&apos; to mimic the sound pattern as the four pairs of bogie wheels ran over joins between the lengths of track. (A sound no longer heard since welded rail joins were introduced.) &quot; Trains &quot; was released as a 78 and 45 by English Decca Records (F 5278) which remained on catalogue into the 1970s. At the end of the record, Gardiner signs off with &quot; Well folks, that&apos;s all: back to the asylum. &quot; He was summoned to Buckingham Palace to give a performance in person.
