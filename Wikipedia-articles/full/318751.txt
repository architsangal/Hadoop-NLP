[ the sexual preference of adults for mid-to-late adolescents the sexual preference of adults for prepubescents Pedophilia ] { Tondo from an } { Attic } { kylix, 5th century BCE. } Ephebophilia is the sexual preference of adults for mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19. [ Krafft-Ebing R. Moll A. 1924 Psychopathia sexualis Stuttgart Ferdinand Enke ] [ Blanchard R. Lykins A. D. Wherrett D. Kuban M. E. Cantor J. M. Blak T. Dickey R. Klassen P. E. 2008 Pedophilia, hebephilia, and the DSM–V Archives of Sexual Behavior 38 3 335–350 10.1007/s10508-008-9399-9 18686026 ] The term was originally used in the late 19th to mid 20th century, and has been more recently revisited by Ray Blanchard. It is one of a number of sexual preferences across age groups subsumed under the technical term &quot; chronophilia &quot;. Ephebophilia strictly denotes the preference for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners, not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction. In sexual ethics, it may be defined as a sexual preference for girls generally 14–16 years old, and boys generally 14–19 years old. [ Ethics and Sex Igor Primoratz Routledge 1999 New York 0-415-09333-3 ] Some authors define ephebophilia as a sexual preference for pubescent and adolescent boys.

[ Etymology ] The term comes from the [ ἔφηβος ] ( ephebos ) variously defined as &quot; one arrived at puberty &quot;, &quot; a youth of eighteen who underwent his dokimasia and was registered as a citizen (Athens) &quot;, and &quot; arriving at man&apos;s estate; &quot; and φιλία ( -philia ) &quot; love &quot;.

Ephebophilie en wetenschap [Ephebophilia and science]. &apos;&apos;Vriendschap&apos;&apos;, 35-35. } The term has been described by Frenchman Félix Buffière in 1980 { Buffière, F. (1980). Éros adolescent : la pédérastie dans la Grèce antique, Paris, p.11. } and Pakistan i scholar Tariq Rahman, [ Rahman T. 1990 Boy-Love in the Urdu Ghazal Annual of Urdu Studies 7 1–20 ] who argued that &quot; ephebophilia &quot; should be used in preference to &quot; homosexuality &quot; when describing the aesthetic and erotic interest of adult men in adolescent boys in classical Persian, Turkish or Urdu literature. [ Characteristics ] Because mid-to-late adolescents may have physical characteristics near (or in some cases, identical) to that of full-grown adults, some level of sexual attraction to persons in the age group is common among adults. Ephebophilia is used only to describe the preference for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners, not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction. Generally, the preference is not regarded by psychologist s as a pathology when it does not interfere with other major areas of one&apos;s life, and is not listed by name as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), the ICD-10, or as a paraphilia. However, the preference can sometimes be diagnosed as a disorder if it results in dysfunction or exploitative behavior, under the DSM specification 309.2, &quot; Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified. &quot; [ Foley Sharon R. Arthur, K.; Kelly, B. 2006 Psychiatric sequelae of Parkinson disease: a case report European Psychiatry 21 3 211–213 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2005.05.007 16137863 ] Researchers state that hebephilia, erotic interest which centers on pubescents, has not come into widespread use, even among professionals who work with sex offenders, and may have been confused with the term ephebophilia, &quot; which denotes men who prefer adolescents around 15–19 years of age. &quot; It is concluded that &quot; few would want to label erotic interest in late — or even mid — adolescents as a psychopathology, so the term hebephilia may have been ignored along with ephebophilia. &quot; [ See also ] The Japanese adaptation, lolicon (drawn from Lolita complex), refers more broadly to depictions of neotenic femininity regardless of who desires them. Appreciators are also called lolicons, whereas the subject girl characters are abbreviated as loli. { Pederasty } [ References ] [ 2 ] Category:Adolescence Category:Pederasty Category:Sexuality and age Category:Youth bg:Ефебофилия br:Efebofiliezh cs:Efebofilie da:Efebofili de:Ephebophilie fr:Éphébophilie hr:Efebofilija id:Efebofilia ka:ეფებოფილია nl:Efebofilie ja:エフェボフィリア pl:Efebofilia pt:Efebofilia ru:Эфебофилия simple:Ephebophilia sh:Efebofilija fi:Efebofilia uk:Ефебофілія zh:戀青少年
