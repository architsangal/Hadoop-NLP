Gantin.jpg Palestrina (suburbicarian) ] Bernardin Gantin (8 May 1922 – 13 May 2008) was a Benin ese cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. [ Early life and ordination ] Born in Toffo, Benin, his name means &quot; tree of iron &quot; (gan, iron and tin, tree ), which explains his coat of arms. He entered the minor seminary at age 14 in Benin, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1951 under Archbishop Louis Parisot. In 1953 he was sent to Rome to study theology and Canon law. [ Bishop ] He was consecrated bishop of Tipasa of Mauritania and Auxiliary of Cotonou in 1957 by Cardinal Eugène-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant, to whose then post of Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals he would one day succeed. [ Archbishop ] In 1960, Pope John XXIII appointed him Archbishop of Cotonou. After he attended the Second Vatican Council, Pope Paul VI appointed him to the Roman Curia and made him a Cardinal-Deacon of Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re in Pope Paul&apos;s final consistory in 1977. He was named President of the Pontifical Council &apos;&apos;Cor Unum&apos;&apos; by Pope John Paul I, the only administrative appointment of that month-long papacy. During the Conclave following John Paul I&apos;s death, Cardinal Gantin was thought to be one of the papabili, those cardinals who are considered favorites to be elected pope. [ Congregation for Bishops ] Under Pope John Paul II he headed the Congregation for Bishops, supervising episcopal appointments in the non-missionary Latin Rite dioceses throughout the world, from 1984 to 1998. He was appointed as Cardinal-Bishop of the suburbicarian diocese of Palestrina in 1986, and as Dean of the College of Cardinals had the additional title of Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, as the dean traditionally does, from 1993 to 2002 when he retired to move home to Benin. (He relinquished the title of the Ostia see when he retired.) Because he turned 80 on 8 May 2002, Cardinal Gantin was not eligible to vote in the 2005 Papal Election. [ Death and mourning ] Gantin died in Paris on 13 May 2008, five days after his 86th birthday. { Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, Africa&apos;s leading cardinal, has died; } { The Times, 14 May 2008 } The Beninese government declared three days of mourning for him, beginning on 14 May. { &quot; Benin starts three-day national mourning for late Cardinal Gantin &quot;, African Press Agency, 14 May 2008. } { San Fiorano (Lodi), } { Italy, in 1984 } Following his death, a telegram was sent by Pope Benedict XVI to Marcel Honorat Léon Agboton, the current Archbishop of Cotonou, after the death of Gantin was announced. The telegram described Gantin as &quot; an eminent son of Benin and Africa who won great respect within the universal Church &quot;. The Pope wrote &quot; I ask God the Father, from Whom all mercy comes, to welcome into His light and peace this eminent son of Benin and of Africa who, universally esteemed, was animated by a profound apostolic spirit and by an exalted sense of the Church and her mission in the world. &quot; [ http://africanmeeting.net/Benin/index.php/2008/05/16/pope-mourns-africas-eminent-son-cardinal-gantin/ Pope Mourns ‘Africa’s Eminent Son’, Cardinal Gantin 16 May 2008 Africanmeeting.net 21 December 2008 ] [ See also ] Roman Catholicism in Benin [ References ] [ External links ] Official Vatican biography Biography from Catholic Hierarchy.org Biography [ ca ] [ Archbishop of Cotonou Louis Parisot Christophe Adimou 1960 –1971 ] [ Dean of the College of Cardinals Agnelo Rossi Joseph Ratzinger 1993 –2002 ] [ Sebastiano Baggio Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops Lucas Moreira Neves 8 April 1984 – 25 June 1998 ] [ Gantin, Bernardin Catholic cardinal 8 May 1922 Toffo, Benin 13 May 2008 Paris, France ] Category:1922 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Beninese cardinals Category:Cardinal-bishops of Ostia Category:Cardinal-bishops of Palestrina Category:Deans of the College of Cardinals Category:Beninese Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:Members of the Congregation for Bishops Category:Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace Category:Pontifical Council Cor Unum Category:Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants Category:Pontifical Commission for Latin America Category:Cardinals created by Pope Paul VI Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Lion cs:Bernardin Gantin da:Bernardin Gantin de:Bernardin Gantin fr:Bernardin Gantin it:Bernardin Gantin ka:ბერნარდენ განტენი la:Bernardinus Gantin lmo:Bernardin Gantin nl:Bernardin Gantin no:Bernardin Gantin pl:Bernardin Gantin pt:Bernardin Gantin ru:Гантен, Бернарден sl:Bernardin Gantin fi:Bernardin Gantin sv:Bernardin Gantin
