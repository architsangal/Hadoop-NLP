The blue rectangles stand for the twin towers and the white pentagon represents the Pentagon building. The blue circle symbolizes the unity of this country after the attacks. The 9/11 National Remembrance Flag was designed by Stephan and Joanne Galvin soon after September 11, 2001. They wanted to do something to help and were inspired by a neighbor&apos;s POW/MIA flag. They wanted sell the flag so people would remember the September 11 attacks and in order to raise money for relief efforts. The blue represents the colors of the state flags that were involved in the attacks. The black represents sorrow for innocent lives lost. The four stars stand for the four planes that crashed and the lives lost, both in the crash and in the rescue efforts, as well as the survivors. The blue star is a representation of American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon. The two white stars represent American Airlines flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175, as well as the twin towers. The red star stands for United Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and all those who sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent. The colors of the stars represent the American flag. The four stars are touching each other and the blue parts of the flag in order to symbolize the unity of the people of the United States. The National Flag of Honor and the National Flag of Heroes were created by John Michelotti for three main reasons: (1) &quot; To immortalize the individual victims that were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. &quot; (2) &quot; To give comfort to the families left behind knowing that their loved one will be forever honored and remembered. &quot; (2) &quot; To create an enduring symbol, recognized by the world, of the human sacrifice that occurred on September 11, 2001. &quot; The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes are based on the American flag. They both have the names of all the innocent people who were killed in the September 11 attacks printed on the red and white stripes of the American Flag. Both flags have a white space across the bottom with the name of the flag and a description printed in black. The Flag of Honor reads: &quot; This flag contains the names of those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them &quot; The Flag of Heroes reads: &quot; This flag contains the names of the emergency service personnel who gave their lives to save others in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them. &quot; The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes were featured at the NYC 9/11 Memorial Field 5th Anniversary in Manhattan&apos;s Inwood Hill Park September 8–12, 2006. There 3,000 flags which represented those who died in the September 11 attacks. [ http://www.nyc911memorialfield.org/ FDNY - Powered by Chris A.

The location is in Second Life, on the island we have named after the original design: Celestial Requiem NYC. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the &quot; Reflected Absence &quot; memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long. World Trade Center Memorial (SecondLife) is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
