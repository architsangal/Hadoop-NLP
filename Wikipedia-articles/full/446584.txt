[ 2001 1 10 ] [ 2005 1 28 ] { 5 } { 91 } { List of Grounded for Life episodes } { Ended } { http://www.groundedforlife.com/ } Grounded for Life is an American television sitcom that debuted on January 10, 2001 as a mid-season replacement on the Fox Network. It was created by Mike Schiff and Bill Martin. It ran for two seasons on the network until being cancelled only two episodes into its third season. It was immediately picked up for the rest of the third season by The WB Television Network, where it aired for two additional seasons until it ended on January 28, 2005. The show starred Donal Logue and Megyn Price as Sean and Claudia (Bustamonte) Finnerty, an Irish American /Italian-Catholic couple who lived on Staten Island, New York, while raising their three kids, Lily ( Lynsey Bartilson ), Jimmy ( Griffin Frazen ), and Henry ( Jake Burbage ). The show also stars Kevin Corrigan, Bret Harrison and Richard Riehle. The show has featured guest stars such as Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Mila Kunis, Wilmer Valderrama (cast of That &apos;70s Show ), Mike Vogel, Natasha Lyonne, Vincent Pastore, Miriam Flynn, Stephen Root, Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Scott Thompson (cast of The Kids in the Hall ), and Elizabeth Berridge (Kevin Corrigan&apos;s real life wife). [ Premise ] The show is set in an Irish neighborhood of Staten Island, New York and is about the comedic interplay of the Irish Catholic Finnerty family. One of the central aspects of the show is that Sean and Claudia Finnerty had their first child and got married when they were only 18 years old. Thus, while they have three children, including a teenage daughter, the two parents are themselves relatively young and not out of their &quot; wild &quot; years. (In one episode, where Sean goes to pick up his daughter at a police station and is mistaken for her drug dealer, his father quips, &quot; That&apos;s what happens when you&apos;re 17 and don&apos;t know what a rubber is! &quot; ) The show features an unusual style of storytelling, often starting with a scene at the end of the story or sometimes in the middle and filling in the gaps with flashbacks. Its main concepts are an Irish Catholic family with three children - one girl and two boys - surviving one catastrophe after another, utilizing flashbacks to further explain current situations they find themselves in. The opening sequence is set to a guitar theme, performed by the band Ween, that also serves as the music between scenes. The first sequence, used for the first eleven episodes of Season 1, showed the family playing basketball. From the twelfth episode ( &quot; Jimmy Was Kung-Fu Fighting &quot; ) onwards, it showed a mix of scenes from Season 1. The sequence was updated each year to include scenes from the current season. The opening sequence was later truncated, as cast names were shown after the sequence and over the episode itself. Music is important in the production of the series, with musical cues used when going into and out of flashbacks. In addition, episodes are named after songs or, in many cases, are a play on the name or lyrics of songs. Also, each episode has slightly different music in the opening sequence, differing at the end of the sequence. Two episodes from Season 3, &quot; Oh, What a Knight &quot; and &quot; Part-Time Lover &quot;, did not air on primetime, but can be seen in syndication on ABC Family. [ Cast and characters ] [ Main cast ] Original cast of &apos;&apos;Grounded for Life&apos;&apos;, seasons 1 &amp; 2 [ List of Grounded for Life characters ] Donal Logue and Megyn Price portrayed Sean and Claudia Finnerty, a Staten Island couple who were expecting and married by the age of 18. Sean was an electrician in the underground of the New York subway, but he later became the owner of a bar with his brother, Eddie. Claudia, who is the mother of the household, worked as a hostess in a Soho restaurant, and later decided to go back to college; when her daughter Lily decided that college wasn&apos;t for her, it made Claudia realize that education is important. She regrets that she never went to college, but she was pregnant with Lily at the time. By their early 30s, Sean and Claudia had three children (later four), the first being Lily, played by Lynsey Bartilson. Lily is a selfish, spoiled brat, who often tries to get the attention of boys, and often turns to dorky next-door neighbor, Brad O&apos;Keefe, whom she later starts dating. She also dated the drummer of Sean and Eddie&apos;s band, Dean Peramotti, who she went with for a while, until she cheated on him with Brad. Lily is mainly jealous of her mother, Claudia, fearing Claudia is &quot; hotter &quot; than she is, with the boys checking her out, especially Brad. On several occasions Lily has been drunk; once she bumped into Claudia at a college party, and they came to an arrangement to keep it quiet from Sean. Lily blames all her problems on her parents mostly on the grounds that they had her so young. Lily was shocked to discover she was born before her parents were married, but later realized she was proof of their love. Jimmy, played by Griffin Frazen, is the second Finnerty child and the oldest boy, he is the black sheep of the family. His choices are not always accepted by his parents, like the time he decided to become a vegetarian. Jimmy is smart and wants to do well at school, but his parents sometimes accidentally seem to hold him back. Once at a street fair, Sean and Claudia went to a Ramones concert, and Jimmy was late with his science project, causing him to be suspended. The following day he went missing, and was later discovered to have sneaked back into school. Jimmy has been bullied at school; once he fought back and was accused of being the bully. He was also bullied by a girl, although it turned out that she actually liked him. Henry, played by Jake Burbage, is the Finnerty&apos;s youngest son, and is the most optimistic of the family. He is a little wild and sometimes annoying, but is also kindhearted to people. Henry also believes anything he is told, like the time Jimmy tells him he is a robot, to explain why there are no baby pictures of him. Jake Burbage left the show at the end of season four (in the summer of 2004) to move back east which is why he was never seen in season five. However, his character still remained in the show, as he was mentioned a few times throughout the duration. Rose, Sean and Claudia&apos;s youngest daughter, was born in the last episode. Claudia discovered she was pregnant at the start of season five, and in the season finale — at Lily&apos;s graduation — she went into labor and delivered Rose at the hospital. Eddie, played by Kevin Corrigan, is Sean&apos;s younger brother. He is generally up to no good, he is strange, and he is a womanizer. You can&apos;t get a straight answer out of him on many things. Claudia and Eddie often had their differences throughout the series run. The worst thing he ever did was film a porn film in the Finnerty house; for this Claudia and Sean put him out. &apos;&apos;Grounded for Life&apos;&apos; cast, seasons 3-5 Walt, played by Richard Riehle (recurring: seasons 3–5), is Sean and Eddie&apos;s strict father. He is often going on at Sean and Claudia for being too soft on their kids. Sean and Eddie had quite a frightening up-bringing, as Walt often scared them by telling them that their sins would send them to hell, or he would give them booklets explaining what effect sins would have on them. His explanation to Sean about how babies are conceived was a little late, as the conversation occurred after Lily was born. Walt lost his wife, and has had little luck with women; he once had a woman whom Sean and Eddie didn&apos;t like. Lily and Brad set him up on a date with a woman, or whom they thought was a woman. Another woman handcuffed him in the bar and robbed it. Brad O&apos;Keefe, played by Bret Harrison (recurring: seasons 1 &amp; 2), is the Finnerty&apos;s geeky next-door neighbor. He had an on-off relationship with Lily. She cheated on her boyfriend Dean with Brad, and they once broke up when they realized they cheated on each other, during a summer of being apart. They eventually got back together. In one episode, Brad was upset when his parents split up, so the Finnertys decided to celebrate his birthday at their house. He was angry to then discover that his mother, Connie, had a fling with Eddie during the party. In the end, his parents reconciled.

She frequently tries to tell Sean and Claudia how to raise their kids, and is always on their backs at school, especially Lily. She has complained in the past about Lily&apos;s skirt being too short and Jimmy&apos;s hair being too long. Sean once caused her to use the F word. Dean Peramotti, played by Mike Vogel, was the drummer of Sean and Eddie&apos;s band, and met and started dating Lily. She had been going out a while until she cheated on him with Brad. Dan O&apos;Keefe, played by Gregory Jbara, is Brad&apos;s father. Sean and Dan never got along and were constantly fighting. He was busted for having an affair, when Sean challenged him to a tennis match and Sean noticed that all the weekend &quot; tennis lessons &quot; Dan had were useless. His wife Connie discovered this, and they broke up, Connie then had a brief fling with Eddie, but they soon got back together. [ Finnerty Household ] The household that makes for the main location for the series features interesting background items that allude to the interests of the family. Throughout the series, there is a picture of Lou Thesz hanging in the living room and a real-life picture of a young Lynsey Bartilson, who plays Lily in the series. The living room also features a framed and hung vintage baseball bat and a couple of crosses, representing the Catholic faith of the family. The refrigerator in the kitchen is always changing, but prominently features fruit magnets and a sticker bearing the logo of video game developer, Rockstar Games. Jimmy&apos;s room changes many times throughout the series (especially after the departure of the Henry character from the show), but at least one piece of WWE merchandise can be spotted in any given scene in the location, most notable the pillow bearing the WWE logo (however, in the last few episodes of season five, the pillow is turned over, hiding the logo). Jimmy&apos;s room also features a vintage Indianapolis Speedway poster (dated May 13, 1914), a dartboard, a small basketball hoop and at times featured a &quot; Shonen Jump &quot; poster and posters of bands such as Less Than Jake and Green Day. Lily&apos;s room has a computer, a snowboarding poster, and a scrapbook poster, in addition to other, nondescript items that change throughout the series.
