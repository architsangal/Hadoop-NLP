Translated, the runic message was &quot; Year ????. Four maidens camped on this hill. &quot; Hjalmar Holand, principal promoter of the Kensington Runestone (found not far to the south-east of Barrett in 1898) interpreted the year symbols as 1362, the same as the Kensington stone, but debunker Johan Holvik thought they should be read as 1776. The two experts did agree that the stone seemed to be a hoax. When Holvik revisited the area and asked Setterlund what the year symbols were meant to represent, the farmer confessed that he had indeed carved the stone himself, using a list of runes in a textbook, and intended the date 1876, adding &quot; It sure doesn&apos;t take much to put some people on if they want to believe you bad enough. &quot; { David A.

Holvik and the Kensington Runestone &quot;, in Minnesota History (Fall 2000), Minnesota Historical Society } [ Places of interest ] The Lakeside Pavilion is one of the few surviving lakeside facilities of its kind in Minnesota.
