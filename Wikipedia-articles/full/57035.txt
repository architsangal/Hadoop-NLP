It is located at the confluence of the Alzette and Pétrusse Rivers in southern Luxembourg. The city contains the historic Luxembourg Castle, established by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed. Luxembourg City lies at the heart of Western Europe, situated [ 213 km on ] by road from Brussels, [ 372 km on ] from Paris, [ 209 km on ] from Cologne, and [ 65 km on ] from Metz in northeast France.

[ History ] Old City of Luxembourg at night In the Roman era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two Roman road s that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of Saint Maximin in Trier in 963, Siegfried I of the Ardennes, a close relative of King Louis II of France and Emperor Otto the Great, acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named Lucilinburhuc ( &quot; small castle &quot; ), on the Bock Fiels ( &quot; rock &quot; ), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty. In 987 Egbert, Archbishop of Trier consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael &apos;s Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed. The city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the cathedral of Notre Dame ), new walls were built that included an area of [ 5 ha acre off ]. In about 1340, under the reign of John the Blind, new fortifications were built that stood until 1867. { Hollerich quarter } In 1443, the Burgundians under Philip the Good conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later Spanish and Austrian empires (See Spanish Netherlands and Spanish road ) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the Prussians conquered Luxembourg. In the 17th century, the first casemates were built; initially, Spain built [ 23 km mi on ] of tunnels, starting in 1644. [ http://www.lcto.lu/html_en/sites_attractions/attractions/the_fortress.html The Fortress 23 July 2006 Luxembourg City Tourism Office ] These were then enlarged under French rule by Marshal Vauban, and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s. During the French Revolutionary Wars, the city was occupied by France twice: once, briefly, in 1792–3, and, later, after a seven-month siege. { Kreins (2003), p. 64 } Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer Lazare Carnot called Luxembourg &quot; the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar &quot;, giving rise to the city&apos;s nickname: the &apos; Gibraltar of the North &apos;. Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the département of Forêts, with Luxembourg City as its préfecture. Under the 1815 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars, Luxembourg City was placed under Prussian military control as a part of the German Confederation, although sovereignty passed to the House of Orange-Nassau, in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The cercle municipal on the mediatheque After the Luxembourg Crisis, the 1867 Treaty of London required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold francs, and required the destruction of over [ 24 km 0 on ] of underground defenses and [ 4 ha acre off ] of casemate s, batteries, barracks, etc. [ http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/699.pdf World Heritage List - Luxembourg 19 July 2006 1 October 1993 PDF UNESCO ] Furthermore, the Prussian garrison was to be withdrawn. { Treaty of London, 1867, Article IV.

Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state. Despite Luxembourg&apos;s best efforts to remain neutral in the First World War, it was occupied by Germany on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, Helmuth von Moltke moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted communist revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a socialist republic, but it lasted only a few hours. { Luxembourg country profile. WorldStatesman.org. Retrieved on 2006-07-23. } In 1921, the city limits were greatly expanded. The communes of Eich, Hamm, Hollerich, and Rollingergrund were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978). Boulevard Royal In 1940, Germany occupied Luxembourg again. The Nazis were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944. { Thewes (2003), p. 121 } The city was under long-range bombardment by the German V-3 cannon in December 1944 and January 1945. After the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981.

[ Geography ] [ Topography ] Luxembourg seen from Spot satellite { Adolphe Bridge } Luxembourg City lies on the southern part of the Luxembourg plateau, a large Early Jurassic sandstone formation that forms the heart of the Gutland, a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country. The city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the Alzette and Pétrusse rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The [ 70 m ft on ] deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and viaduct s, including the Adolphe Bridge, the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and the Passerelle. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges. The commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over [ 51 km 2 0 on ], or 2% of the Grand Duchy&apos;s total area. This makes the city the fourth-largest commune in Luxembourg, and by far the largest urban area. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km 2; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the UNESCO sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits. [ Quarters of Luxembourg City ] [ Quarters of Luxembourg City ] Luxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four quarters, which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhood s and suburb s of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as Bonnevoie, are divided between two quarters.

Moderate to heavy cloud cover is present for more than two-thirds of the year.
