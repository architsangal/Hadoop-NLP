The population was 3,358 at the 2000 census. On the peninsula, Buras has been located higher, with Triumph located southeast of Buras. [ History ] The town of Buras was established, informally, in the 1840s. Several small settlements on the West Bank of the Mississippi River north of Fort St. Philip became known collectively as the Quartiers des Burats, the Burat Settlement, anchored on the property of Sebastian Burat, near where Cazezu Boulevard meets Parish Highway 11 today. Burat was later anglicized to Buras. In 1854, the Buras Post Office was established, along with a regular mail route by packet boat on the river. By 1864, a new church, Our Lady of Good Harbor, was established in Buras as the community grew.In April of 1862, during the American Civil War, the Battle of Fort Jackson and Fort St.Phillip took place near Buras. Union Flag Officer David Farragut led a fleet up the river to capture New Orleans and engaged the forts in the early morning hours of April 23rd. A single Union vessel, the USS Varuna, was sunk near Buras in an engagement with the Confederate steamer Governor Moore. The heavily damaged Governor Moore also sank not far from its Union opponent.In first decades of the 20th century, Buras&apos; primary industries were oyster fishing and citrus farming. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered in the region, along with natural gas and sulfur. One of the first producing fields was established in Quarantine Bay, east of Buras, by Gulf Oil Company. With the coming of the oil and gas industries, Buras began to slowly evolve from a farming and fishing village into a larger community.Buras-Triumph and the surrounding communities have been subjected to many devastating hurricanes over the years, including the 1893 Cheniere Caminada hurricane, which destroyed the original church, the August 1901 Hurricane, the Great Hurricane of 1915, Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Camille in 1969. However, more recently this area became grimly well-known as the location where, on August 29, 2005, the eye of Hurricane Katrina, made first landfall in Louisiana. Although Katrina was one of the costliest man-made disasters to strike the United States, according to the Hurricane Severity Index, both Betsy and Camille were higher intensity hurricanes than Katrina at landfall. However, the loss of surrounding marsh lands to erosion and subsidence allowed the energy of Hurricane Katrina&apos;s storm surge to overtop the levee system and the area was devastated yet again.The recovery and rebuilding continues in Buras, Triumph and surrounding communities. Emblematic of the recovery is the new Buras water tower. The image of the previous tower, collapsed in the rubble, was an icon of the destruction Katrina brought.
