[ June 2008 June 2008 June 2008 ] The Rambouillet Agreement is the name of a proposed peace agreement between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and a delegation representing the ethnic- Albanian majority population of Kosovo. It was drafted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and named for Chateau Rambouillet, where it was initially proposed. The significance of the agreement lies in the fact that Yugoslavia refused to accept it, which NATO used as justification to start the Kosovo War. Belgrade&apos;s rejection was based on the argument that the agreement contained provisions for Kosovo&apos;s autonomy that went further than the Serbian/Yugoslav government saw as reasonable. The most controversial provision was the status envisioned for Kosovo, by which Kosovo would remain a de jure province of Serbia, but would become a de facto third republic. This provision spelled out a greater degree of autonomy vis-à-vis the federal government for Kosovo than Serbia or Montenegro. Serbia viewed this as a secession of Kosovo from Serbia. Even more controversial was that while Serbia would retain no influence over its then-southern province of Kosovo, Kosovo would have been granted substantial influence over Serbia. For example, Kosovars would take part in Serbian elections by electing representatives (MPs) to the Serbian parliament, which would have no jurisdiction over Kosovo. Kosovars would have guaranteed seats in the Serbian Government and the Serbian Supreme Court, which would deal exclusively with the territory of Serbia without Kosovo. Kosovo would also have an independent judicial system including its own autonomous Constitutional Court, but it would also have guaranteed representatives in the Yugoslavian judiciary, which would have no jurisdiction over Kosovo. Furthermore, NATO would have free and unrestricted military access to the country. According to Appendix B: NATO personnel shall enjoy, together with their vehicles, vessels, aircraft, and equipment, free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout the FRY including associated airspace and territorial waters. This shall include, but not be limited to, the right of bivouac, maneuver, billet, and utilization of any areas or facilities as required for support, training, and operations. After the war the International Independent Inquiry on Kosovo led by Richard Goldstone investigated the Appendix issue and concluded that it had by accident been copied from other peacekeeping agreements such as those for Bosnia. However, the British politician, Lord Gilbert, said in an inquiry by a House committee &quot; I think the terms put to Milošević at Rambouillet were absolutely intolerable; how could he possibly accept them? It was quite deliberate. &quot; [ http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmdfence/347/0062005.htm Select Committee on Defence Minutes of Evidence June 2000 ] The Serbian Parliament responded on 23 March 1999 to the agreement with a sharp criticism. Though it agreed that Kosovo should be given autonomy, it stated that it would prefer the incursion of the United Nations over that of NATO, accusing the &quot; separatist-terrorist delegation of ethnic Albanians &quot; of: [avoiding] direct talks as it did not give up its separatist goals: to use autonomy as a means for establishing a &apos;state within a state&apos;; to secure occupation of Serbia through the implementation of the political agreement; to create an ethnically pure Kosovo-Metohija under the pretext of protecting human rights and democracy; and to secure the secession of Kosovo-Metohija from Serbia with the help of their patrons and through an international protectorate and referendum.

However, the entire text of the agreement was leaked onto the Internet about the time when the war started and many non-mainstream reporters and NGO activists were referencing the agreement in their commentaries on the war. The Rambouillet Agreement was initially fully rejected by the Kosovar-Albanian side, whereas Belgrade had agreed to all of the political and non-military points. Belgrade requested NATO troops be replaced with UN troops for full acceptance. At the talks, the Agreement was repeatedly amended until the Kosovar-Albanian side was forced to sign, whereas Belgrade rejected it. It was amended to open the Kosovo status process and include annexes that were found unacceptable by most, which bordered FRY on the level of NATO occupation. { http://books.google.com/books?id=skdoYDs1e8AC &amp; pg=PA176 &amp; lpg=PA176 &amp; dq=Roland+Keith+William+Walker &amp; source=bl &amp; ots=7hg2DoThWQ &amp; sig=CEiokh-juqblP3h8wm_5KA_cMRk &amp; hl=en &amp; ei=LYZRS8abKsXH4gaMkIGYCQ &amp; sa=X &amp; oi=book_result &amp; ct=result &amp; resnum=2 &amp; ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage &amp; q=Roland%20Keith%20William%20Walker &amp; f=false } A republican foreign-policy aide later told a think tank that he&apos;d heard a US official say: [ We intentionally set the bar too high for the Serbs to comply. They need some bombing, and that&apos;s what they are going to get. ] { http://www.fair.org/press-releases/kosovo-talks.html } John Pilger wrote in New Statesman : [ Anyone scrutinizing the Rambouillet document is left with little doubt that the excuses given for the subsequent bombing were fabricated. The peace negotiations were stage managed and the Serbs were told: surrender and be occupied, or don&apos;t surrender and be destroyed. ] [ http://www.newstatesman.com/199905170014 Revealed: the amazing Nato plan, tabled at Rambouillet, to occupy Yugoslavia May 1999 ] [ Negotiations ] The biggest problem for both sides was that the Contact Group&apos;s non-negotiable principles were mutually unacceptable. The Albanians were unwilling to accept a solution that would retain Kosovo as part of Serbia. The Serbs did not want to see the pre-1990 status quo restored, and they were implacably opposed to any international role in the governance of the province. The negotiations thus became somewhat a game of musical chairs, each side trying to avoid being blamed for the breakdown of the talks. [ June 2008 ] To add to the farce, the NATO Contact Group countries were desperate to avoid having to make good on their threat of force—Greece and Italy were strongly opposed to the whole idea, and there was vigorous opposition to military action in every NATO country. [ December 2010 ] Consequently, when the talks failed to achieve an agreement by the original deadline of 19 February, they were extended by another month. The two paragraphs above, however, are partially contradicted by the historical evidence. In particular, the statement by the co-chairmen on the 23 February 1999 that the negotiations have led to a consensus on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system. They went on to say that a political framework is now in place leaving the further work of finalizing the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the invited international civilian and military presence in Kosovo.

In the end, on 18 March 1999, the Albanian, American and British delegation signed what became known as the &apos;Rambouillet Accords&apos; [ http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html Rambouillet Agreement -Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo US State Department March 1999 ] while the Serbian and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia; a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. Critics of the Kosovo war have claimed that the Serbian refusal was prompted by unacceptably broad terms in the access rights proposed for the NATO peacekeeping force. This was based on standard United Nations peacekeeping agreements such as that in force in Bosnia, but would have given broader rights of access than were really needed, and onto the entire territory of Yugoslavia, not just the province. It has been claimed that Appendix B would have authorized what would amount to a NATO occupation of the whole of Yugoslavia, and that its presence in the accords was the cause of the breakdown of the talks. The chapter dealing with the Kosovan economy was also equally revealing. It called for &apos;privatization of all Government assets&apos;; this seems to be commensurate with the fact that around 372 centres of industries were bombed during the conflict, including many with no relevance to military means. In commentary released to the press, former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger declared that: [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/mar/24/serbia-kosovo The Guardian London Serbia&apos;s anniversary is a timely reminder Ian Bancroft 24 March 2009 22 May 2010 ] { Henry Kissinger, Daily Telegraph, 28 June 1999 } Events proceeded rapidly after the failure at Rambouillet. The international monitors from the OSCE withdrew on 22 March, for fear of the monitors&apos; safety ahead of the anticipated bombing by NATO. On 23 March, the Serbian assembly accepted the principle of autonomy for Kosovo and non-military part of the agreement. But the Serbian side had objections to the military part of the Rambouillet agreement, appendix B in particular, which it characterized as &quot; NATO occupation &quot;. The full document was described &quot; fraudulent &quot; because the military part of the agreement was offered only at the very end of the talks without much possibility for negotiation, [ June 2009 ] and because the other side, condemned in harshest terms as a &quot; separatist–terrorist delegation &quot;, completely refused to meet delegation of FRY and negotiate directly during the Rambouillet talks at all. [ June 2009 ] The following day, 24 March, NATO bombing began.
