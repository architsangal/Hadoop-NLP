[ Phenomena Phenomena (disambiguation) ] A phenomenon (from Greek φαινόμενoν), plural phenomena, is any observable occurrence. { New Oxford American Dictionary (2nd ed.) } Phenomena are often, but not always, understood as &apos;appearances&apos; or &apos; experiences &apos;. These are themselves sometimes understood as involving qualia. The term came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant, who contrasted it with noumenon (for which he used the term Ding an sich, or &quot; thing-in-itself &quot; ), which, in contrast to phenomena, are not directly accessible to observation. Kant was heavily influenced by Leibniz in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms. { Cloud chamber phenomena.

In scientific usage, a phenomenon is any event that is observable, however common it might be, even if it requires the use of instrumentation to observe, record, or compile data concerning it. For example, in physics, a phenomenon may be a feature of matter, energy, or spacetime, such as Isaac Newton &apos;s observations of the moon &apos;s orbit and of gravity, or Galileo Galilei &apos;s observations of the motion of a pendulum. { Jeremy Bernstein, A Theory for Everything, Copernicus, An imprint of Springer-Verlag, New York, 1996, hardback, ISBN 0-387-94700-0 } [ Mechanical phenomena ] A mechanical phenomenon is a physical phenomenon associated with the equilibrium or motion of objects. { audioenglish.net Mechanical phenomenon.

[ Popular phenomena ] [ February 2011 ] In popular usage, a phenomenon often refers to an extraordinary event. [ Group and social phenomena ] [ Social phenomenon ] Group phenomena concern the behavior of a particular group of individual entities, usually organisms and most especially people. The behavior of individuals often changes in a group setting in various ways, and a group may have its own behaviors not possible to an individual because of the herd mentality. Social phenomena apply especially to organisms and people in that subjective states are implicit in the term. Attitudes and events particular to a group may have effects beyond the group, and either be adapted by the larger society, or seen as aberrant, being punished or shunned.
