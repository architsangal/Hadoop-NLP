It was constructed beginning in 1998 as a replacement for the Miami Arena and was designed by the architecture firms Arquitectonica and 360 Architecture. The Arena is home to the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association. In the early 2000s, the Women&apos;s National Basketball Association team Miami Sol played at the arena from the team&apos;s birth in 2000 until the team&apos;s folding in 2002. The AmericanAirlines Arena is directly served by the Miami Metrorail at Government Center Station via free transfers to Metromover &apos;s Freedom Tower Station and Park West Station. The Arena is also within walking distance from the Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre Metrorail Station. American Airlines maintains the American Airlines Arena Travel Center at the venue. { &quot; Miami And Coral Gables, FL Travel Center. &quot; } { American Airlines. Retrieved on April 9, 2009. } AmericanAirlines Arena should not be confused with the American Airlines Center, which is located in Dallas. The official spelling of the building is distinct as &quot; American &quot; and &quot; Airlines &quot; is considered as one word. An example of this wording is FedExForum or FedExField, the only difference is that &quot; AmericanAirlines &quot; and &quot; Arena &quot; are not joined together. The AmericanAirlines Arena has 2,105 club seats, 80 luxury suites, and 76 private boxes. The Waterfront Theater is Florida&apos;s largest theater which is housed within the arena, that can seat between 3,000 and 5,800. The theater can be configured for concerts, family events, musical theatre and other stage shows. [ History ] The AmericanAirlines Arena opened on December 31, 1999 and its construction cost was $213,000,000. Architectural design team members included George Heinlein, Cristian Petschen, Reinaldo Borges, and Lance Simon. The AmericanAirlines Arena was inaugurated with a concert by Gloria Estefan, two days later, on January 2, 2000. The Miami Heat played its first game in the new arena by defeating the Orlando Magic 111–103. As part of its sponsorship arrangement, American Airlines had a giant aircraft painted on top of the arena&apos;s roof, with an American Airlines logo in the center. The design is visible from airplanes taking off and landing at Miami International Airport, where American has a hub. The arena also has luxury skyboxes called &quot; Flagship Lounges, &quot; a trademark originally used for American&apos;s premium-class lounges at certain airports. Local sportscasters often refer to the arena as the &quot; triple-A &quot;. Some sports reporters on the local news stations such as WSVN have referred to the arena as &quot; A 3 &quot; (A cubed). The arena is known for its unusual scoreboard, designed by Artist Christopher Janney. Drawing on the underwater anemone forms, the scoreboard also changes colors depending on the atmosphere. For concerts in an arena configuration, end stage capacity is 12,202 for 180-degree shows, 15,402 for 270-degree shows, 18,309 for 360-degree shows. For center stage concerts the arena can seat 19,146. The Miami Heat has not had to pay to use the $213 million-venue, which sits on $38 million of county land; the county has paid $64 million in operating subsidies. &quot; It was never a good deal, &quot; says former Miami-Dade Commissioner Katy Sorenson, who opposed the new arena in 1996. &quot; There are certain politicians who just get stars in their eyes and don&apos;t really think about what the real cost is going to be. &quot; [ Notable events hosted ] [ February 2010 section ] The AmericanAirlines Arena as well as the American Airlines Center, hosted the NBA Finals in 2006 and 2011, in which the Miami Heat played the Dallas Mavericks.
