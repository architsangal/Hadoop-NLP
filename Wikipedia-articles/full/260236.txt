[ History ] Connecticut River from Newbury Located at the Great Oxbow of the Connecticut River, with vast tracts of beautiful and fertile intervale, the area was a favorite of the Indians. Rivers teemed with salmon and brooks with trout. { A. J. Coolidge &amp; J. B. Mansfield, &apos;&apos;A History and Description of New England;&apos;&apos; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 } Prior to European settlement, the Newbury area was the location of a village called Cowass or Cowassuck of the Pennacook tribe. { Haefeli and Sweeney, Captors and Captives: The 1704 French and Indian Raid on Deerfield, (UMass Press, 2003) pp. 79, 92 } It was first settled by English colonists in 1762 by Samuel Sleeper and family. One of the New Hampshire grants, Newbury was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on March 18, 1763 to General Jacob Bayley and 74 others, some from Newbury, Massachusetts. { A. J. Coolidge &amp; J. B. Mansfield, &apos;&apos;A History and Description of New England;&apos;&apos; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 } The town served as the southern terminus of the Bayley Hazen Military Road, begun by Bayley in 1760 and then continued until 1779 by Colonel Moses Hazen. Meanwhile, pioneer farmer s had to carry their grain 60 miles (97 kilometers) by canoe to Charlestown, New Hampshire to get it ground into flour. By 1859, when the population was 2,984, Newbury had two gristmill s, in addition to a paper mill and steam mill to manufacture mackerel kits. The principal industry, however, along the alluvial meadows was raising beef cattle and sheep, and the production of wool and dairy goods. { John Hayward, &apos;&apos;Gazetteer of Vermont&apos;&apos; 1849, p. 91-92 } The Connecticut &amp; Passumpsic Rivers Railroad opened on November 6, 1848 to the village of Wells River. It developed as an adjunct of the railway town across the Connecticut River at Woodsville, the once bustling village within Haverhill, New Hampshire.
