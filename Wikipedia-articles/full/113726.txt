Hekla is one of Iceland&apos;s most active volcano es; over 20 eruptions have occurred in and around the volcano since 874. During the Middle Ages, Europeans called the volcano the &quot; Gateway to Hell. &quot; Hekla is part of a volcanic ridge, [ 40 km mi 0 ] long. However, the most active part of this ridge, a fissure about [ 5.5 km mi 1 on ] long named Heklugjá, is considered to be the volcano Hekla proper. Hekla looks rather like an overturned boat, with its keel being in fact a series of craters, two of which are generally the most active. The volcano&apos;s frequent large eruptions have covered much of Iceland with tephra and these layers can be used to date eruptions of Iceland&apos;s other volcanos. 10% of the tephra created in Iceland in the last thousand years has come from Hekla, amounting to 5  km 3. The volcano has produced one of the largest volumes of lava of any in the world in the last millennium, around 8  km 3. [ Reputation ] { Abraham Ortelius &apos; 1585 map of Iceland showing Hekla in eruption. The Latin text translates as &quot; The Hekla, perpetually condemned to storms and snow, vomits stones under terrible noise. &quot; } { Olaus Magnus &apos;s &apos;&apos; } { Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus &apos;&apos;, book 2, 1555 } In Icelandic Hekla is the word for a short hooded cloak which may relate to the frequent cloud cover on the summit. An early Latin source refers to the mountain as Mons Casule. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 7 } After the eruption of 1104, stories (which were probably spread deliberately through Europe by Cistercian monks) told that Hekla was the gateway to Hell. The Cistercian monk Herbert of Clairvaux wrote in his De Miraculis (without naming Hekla): [ The renowned fiery cauldron of Sicily, which men call Hell&apos;s chimney... that cauldron is affirmed to be like a small furnace compared to this enormous inferno. Herbert of Clairvaux Liber De Miraculis, 1180 ] A poem by the monk Benedeit from circa 1120 about the voyages of Saint Brendan mentions Hekla as the prison of Judas.The Flatey Book Annal wrote of the 1341 eruption that people saw large and small birds flying in the mountain&apos;s fire which were taken to be souls. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 6 } In the 16th century Caspar Peucer wrote that the Gates of Hell could be found in &quot; the bottomless abyss of Hekla Fell &quot;. The belief that Hekla was the gate to Hell persisted until the 1800s. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 5 } There is still a legend that witch es gather on Hekla for Easter. [ Geology ] A map of the volcanic systems of Iceland Hekla has a morphological type between that of a crater row and stratovolcano (built from mixed lava and tephra eruptions) sited at a rift- transform junction in the area where the south Iceland seismic zone and eastern volcanic zone meet. The unusual form of Hekla is found on very few volcanoes around the world, notably Callaqui in Chile. { El Volcán Callaqui, Ejemplos del Volcanismo Fisural en los Andes del Sur (38°L.S.). Hugo Moeno Roa and Alfredo Lahsen Azar. } { Revista de la Asociación Geológica de Argentina XLII, (1-2), 1-8 } Hekla is situated on a long volcanic ridge of which the 5.5  km Heklugjá fissure is considered Hekla proper. This fissure opens along its entire length during major eruptions and is fed by a magma reservoir estimated to have a top 4  km below the surface with centroid 2.5  km lower.The tephra produced by its eruptions is high in fluorine which is poisonous to animals. Hekla&apos;s basaltic andesite lava generally has a SiO 2 content of over 54%, compared to the 45-50% of other nearby transitional alkaline basalt eruptions (see TAS classification ).

When not erupting Hekla is often covered with snow and small glacier s, it is also unusually aseismic with activity only starting 30–80  minutes before an eruption.

[ http://www.earthice.hi.is/page/ies_hekladeformation Hekla Deformation 2008-01-14 University of Iceland, Institute of Earth Sciences ] Earthquakes in the volcano&apos;s vicinity are generally below magnitude 2 while it is dormant and magnitude 3 when erupting. [ Eruption history ] Hekla beyond a snowy field of volcanic ash The earliest recorded eruption of Hekla took place in 1104, since then there have been between twenty and thirty considerable eruptions, with the mountain sometimes remaining active for periods of six years with little pause. Eruptions in Hekla are extremely varied and difficult to predict. Some are very short (a week to ten days) whereas others can stretch into months and years (the 1947 eruption started March 29, 1947 and ended April 1948). But there is a general correlation: the longer Hekla goes dormant, the larger and more catastrophic its opening eruption will be.

This would have cooled temperatures in the northern parts of the globe for a few years afterwards. Traces of this eruption have been identified in Scottish peat bog s, and in Ireland a study of tree rings dating from this period has shown negligible tree ring growth for a decade.

This was the second largest tephra eruption in the country in historical times with a VEI of 5 like H 3. Farms upwind of the volcano in Þjórsárdalur valley (15  km away), Hrunamannaafréttur (50  km away) and Lake Hvítárvatn (70  km away) were abandoned due to the damage. The eruption caused Hekla to become famous throughout Europe. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 11 } [ 1158, 1206 and 1222 ] A VEI of 4 eruption commenced on January 19, 1158 producing over 0.15  km 3 of lava and 0.2  km 3 of tephra. It is likely to be the source of the Efrahvolshraun lava on the volcano&apos;s west. The 1206 and 1222 eruptions, the first of which began on December 4, were not large (VEIs of 3 and 2 respectively) and distributed around 0.24  km 3 of tephra mainly to the northeast. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 12 } [ 1300-1301 ] This VEI 4 eruption which started on July 11 and lasted for a year was the second largest tephra eruption of Hekla since Iceland was settled, covering 30,000  km 2 of land with 0.31  km 3 of tephra. Over 0.5  km 3 of lava was also expelled. The tephra caused significant damage to the settlements of Skagafjördur and Fljót leading to over 500 deaths that winter. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 14 } The material output from this eruption had SiO 2 levels of between 56% and 64% and apart from a slight abundance of olivine the lava was generally typical of Hekla eruptions.

In late 1389 Hekla erupted again (VEI 3), starting with a large ejection of tephra to the southeast. Later &quot; the eruption fissure moved itself out of the mountain proper and into the woods a little above Skard &quot;. Skard and another nearby farm were destroyed by a large lava flow that now forms the 12.5  km 2 Nordurhraun. In total around 0.3  km 3 of lava and 5×10 7  m 3 of tephra were produced. Another eruption may have occurred in around 1440 at Raudölder, despite being close to Hekla this is not classed as an eruption of Hekla based on the SiO 2 content of the lava. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 18 } [ http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/europe_west_asia/eruption_history.html Hekla Eruption History 2007-10-07 Volcano World ] [ 1510 and 1597 ] 17  cm long volcanic bomb found in the lava-fields of Hekla Details of the 1510 eruption were not recorded until a century later. It started on July 25 and was particularly violent, (VEI 4) firing volcanic bombs as far as Vördufell, 40  km west. Tephra was deposited over Rangárvellir, Holt and Landeyjar, 0.2  km 3 in total. A man in Landsveit was killed. The 1597 (VEI 4) eruption commenced on January 3 and lasted for over 6  months. 0.15  km 3 of tephra was deposited to the south-southeast, damaging Mýrdalur. [ 1636-1637 and 1693 ] The 1636 eruptions was small (VEI 3), starting on May 8, but nevertheless lasted for over a year. The 5×10 7  m 3 of tephra from the eruption damaged pasture to the northeast causing deaths amongst livestock. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 15 } In 1693 an eruption, which started on January 13 and lasted for over 7  months, was one of Hekla&apos;s most destructive (VEI 4). Initially tephra was produced at 60,000  m 3 s −1, 0.18  km 3 during the entire eruption, which also caused lahar s and tsunami. The tephra was deposited to the northwest, destroying and damaging farms and woodland in Thjórsárdalur, Land, Hreppar and Biskupstungur. Fine ash from the eruption reached Norway. There was also damage to wildlife with significant numbers of trout, salmon, ptarmigan and farm animals dying. [ 1725 and 1766-1768 ] The flanks of Hekla A very small eruption, possibly only VEI 1, took place on April 2, 1725 producing flows of lava from locations around Hekla which have since been covered by later lava flows, again these eruptions are not classed as of Hekla itself based on the SiO 2 content of the lava. The eruption of 1766 was much larger (VEI 4) and produced the second largest lava flow, 1.3  km 3 covering 65  km 2, and third largest tephra volume, 0.24  km 3, of any Icelandic volcano during the inhabited era. The eruption s tarted at around 3:30 am on April 5, 1766 and did not stop until May 1768. Initially a 2–4  cm layer of tephra was deposited over Austur-Húnavatnssýsla and Skagafjördur, resulting in the deaths of both fish and livestock. Rangárvellir, Land and Hreppar also suffered damage. During the eruption up to 0.5  m lava bombs were thrown 15–20  km away and a flooding was caused by the sudden melting of snow and ice on Hekla&apos;s slopes. [ 1845-1846, 1878 and 1913 ] Hekla was dormant for more than sixty years before 1845, when it suddenly burst forth on September 2 at 9 am: [ Anonymous Anonymity Wonders of Creation: A descriptive account of volcanoes and their phenomena 6131 2008-08-29 ] { Anonymous, 1872 } The eruption did not finish until around April 5, 1846. Initially in this VEI 4 eruption tephra was produced at 20,000  m 3 s −1. The tephra deposition (0.17  km 3 ) was mainly to the east-southeast, immediately to the east of Hekla the layer was 20–40  cm deep. Fine ash was carried to the Faroes, Shetland and Orkney. Lava flows to the west and northwest covered an area of 25  km 2 with 0.63  km 3 of lava. Large quantities of dark ash were deposited over pasture in the same directions leading to many livestock deaths through fluorosis for the next two years. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 17 } Small eruptions (VEI 2) occurred between February 27, 1878 and April 1878 and then April 25, 1913 and May 18, 1913. These were around 10  km east of Hekla, the first produced 0.2  km 3 of lava from two parallel fissures covering 15.5  km 2. The second caused large fissures at Mundafell and Lambafit which produced 3.8 and 6.3  km 2 of lava respectively. [ 1947-1948 ] Hekla in winter The 1947 eruption started on March 29, 1947 and ended on April 21, 1948. At VEI 4 it is likely that this was both the second greatest lava eruption of Hekla whilst Iceland was inhabited and the second greatest lava eruption in the world in the period 1900-1970. A total lava volume 0.8  km 3 was produced with 0.21  km 3 of tephra. The height of Hekla was 1447  m before the eruption, increasing to a maximum of 1503  m, before dropping to 1491  m subsequently. [ Initial eruption ] The 1947 eruption occurred over a century since the last eruption of Hekla proper, the longest dormant period since 1104. Before the eruption the volcano had been visible from the surrounding area but nothing remarkable was noticed. The eruption occurred at 6:41 am ± 3  min with a loud roar, later eruptions could be heard throughout Iceland. An earthquake at 6:50 am measured 6 on the Mercalli intensity scale and increased the eruption intensity until it covered a 4  km fissure on the ridge.For the first hours the eruption was Plinian, after that it became Vesuvian. The cloud from the eruption had ascended to a height of 30  km by 7:08 am, the wind then carried it southwards towards the Eyjafjallajökull glacier, turning it black. Pumice first landed on Fljótshlíd at around 7:10 am and tephra and ash continued falling until it formed a 3–10  cm layer. A lava bomb that landed 32  km from Hekla was 0.5  m across and weighed 20  kg. Between Vatnafjöll and Hekla a layer of tephra up to a metre thick was deposited including bombs with a diameter larger than this. Bombs with areas of 50  m 2 were dropped onto the slopes of Hekla, up to 1  km away.51  hours after the eruption had started ash fell on Helsinki, Finland having covered 2860  km in this time. The initial tephra production rate in the first 30  minutes of the eruption was 75,000  m 3 s −1, dropping to 22,000  m 3 s −1 for the next half hour. The initial phase produced 0.18  km 3 of tephra, equating to 4.5×10 7 m 3 of solid rock, covering 3,130  km 2 of land and sea. 98 farms were damaged by the eruption but only 2 were no longer farmed in 1970. A large volunteer effort was mobilized to clear the tephra - around 1000  man-days by the end of July. The eruption produced around 3  Ml of water (snowmelt and directly from the fissure) which caused flooding of the Ytri Rangá river. In the first 20  hours of the eruption approximately 3,500  m 3 s −1 of lava was produced from the fissure dividing into various branches and covering 12–15  km 2. On the second day 8 distinct eruption column s were discernable. A crater formed at 860  m called the Lava Crater (Hraungígur) producing a constant flow of lava. Another crater named the Shoulder Crater (Axlargígur) produced a column of smoke every 10  s together with loud explosions that created visible compression waves in the smoke. By the fourth, fifth and sixth days the eruption was greatly diminished and only the shoulder and summit craters were erupting explosively. [ Later eruption ] View of Hekla The explosive eruption increased in strength from 9–12 April and then from April 28 reduced again. On May 3 the volcano stopped throwing out lava in sudden explosions from its craters and changed to continuously ejecting tephra and ash for long periods, until early June when this reduced. On September 2 the Shoulder Crater had a 960  m circumference at its top and the Summit Crater a 700  m circumference at its highest point, 90  m above the ridge. Sandy tephra and ash fell over Iceland in May and June, sometimes making it dark in the daytime near to Hekla. The tephra caused fluorine poisoning of grazing sheep, making them unable to walk. That winter more craters formed, building up cones. Explosive activity had ceased six months after the first eruption. Lava flowed from the Lava Crater continuously during the eruption, starting at a rate of over 100  m 3 s −1, dropping to 5–10  m 3 s −1 in April and early May at a speed of around 20  cms −1 before increasing, eventually reaching 150  m 3 s −1 at the end of June and at similar levels until mid-July with a peak flow speed of 2-2.5  ms −1. From there it gradually decreased to under 10  m 3 s −1 in November. Initially the lava comprised 57-58% SiO 2 and 11% Fe 2 O 3, from the time of peak flow onwards this changed to 54% SiO 2 and 13.5% Fe 2 O 3. The lava river sometimes ran through tunnels before emerging again. The lava front had a height of up to 15  m. On June 15 and 16 a branch of lava flow to the south of Melfell travelled over 1  km in 30  hours before slowing and stopping by June 21, 7.8  km from the Lava Crater. The longest lava stream produced was 8  km long and stopped in Stóraskógsbotnar. A scientist filming one of the lava streams on November 2 was hit by a block of lava and killed. The lava flow stopped after 13  months on April 21 having covered 40  km 2 and with a maximum depth of 100  m. The lava beds produced were mainly the ʻAʻā lava type with Pāhoehoe and lava a budella areas. In April and May 1948 CO 2 emitted from cracks in the ground pooled in hollows near to Hekla killing 15 sheep and some wild animals and birds. In total 24,000 tonnes of CO 2 was emitted. Ditches were dug by farmers to drain these hollows and the CO 2 emission had stopped by the end of the year. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 19-38 } [ 1970 ] { Þjórsá in the foreground } The 1970 eruption of Hekla started at 9:23 pm on May 5, 1970 and lasted until July 5. It had a VEI of 3 and produced 0.2  km 3 of lava covering an area of 18.5  km 2 and 6.6×10   7 m 3 of tephra, deposited over an area of 40,000  km 2, mainly to the northwest of the volcano. The main Hekla fissure only erupted at its far southwest end, most of the eruption was from other fissures nearby. The eruption stopped in the SSW on May 10 and in Hlídargígar on May 20 but a new fissure opened on the same day and lava flowed from this until July 5. The lava was andesite containing olivine, similar to the lava produced later in the eruption of 1947. { Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 39-58 } [ Initial eruption ] Before the eruption a greater than normal amount of snow melting had occurred, indicating the volcano was heating up. Earth tremors began at 8:48 pm on the evening of the eruption, the largest had a magnitude of 4. The eruption started weakly at 9:23 pm IMT ± 2  min before increasing in power.The first pumice fell on Búrfell power station, 15  km away, at 9:35 pm causing people to evacuate. The eruption seems to have started in 2 locations at the same time - to the Shoulder crater&apos;s SSW and below the Lava Crater. At 10:30 pm a crater at 780  m was producing a lava column which reached an altitude of around 1000  m. During the night a 700  m hi gh lava fountain was thrown up from the main crater. A 500  m long fissure starting below the Lava Crater opened and lava fountains and other lava flows emanated from it. One hour into the eruption a new 400  m fissure opened to the NE producing two main lava fountains and shortly after another adjoining fissure opened producing lava fountains to a height of 500  m. At around midnight another fissure opened NW of the Lava Crater, later hurling an over 300  m long lava fountain, 200–300  m into the air. By midnight lava had already covered over 1  km 2 and this extended to 7.5  km 2 by next morning implying a flow rate of around 1500  m 3 s −1. For the first two hours tephra was produced at the rate of 10,000  m 3 s −1. The cloud from the eruption, which had reached [ 53000 ft m 0 ] by 10:10 pm caused a noisy lightning storm. The tephra was transported northwards by the wind causing the sky to turn black in places - 190  km away at Blönduós tephra fell from midnight until 2 am and ash fell on a trawler 330  km away at 2 am. Icelanders sampled the tephra fall in their locality by putting a plate outside to capture everything that fell onto it. This, and other measurements, showed the area covered was long and narrow with the 1  mm contour (an equivalent of 8 tonnes per hectare) extending to the north coast. [ Later eruption ] Hekla in winter 2010 By 5:30 on May 6 the lava flow measured 4  km long. Many lava bombs were found near the main crater, one had an area of 6  m 2 and a likely weight of 12  tons. Xenolith s formed around 2% of the material produced by the craters. These were of rock types including basalt, andesite, ignimbrite and sedimentary rock. The eruption became stronger at Skjólkvíar on May 12 with columns of steam attaining a height of 2500  m. The eruption intensity then gradually reduced until it stopped on May 20. The lava field then had an area of 5.8  km 2. Later that day a 900  m long fissure opened 1  km north of the main Hlídargígar crater. That night it contained 17 lava fountains, each 20–50  m in height. By the evening of the next day 10-12 craters had formed, each throwing pieces of lava 50–100  m in the air. This row of craters was named Öldugígar. Gradually the number of active craters decreased, the most active of these built a cone 100  m higher than the level of the ridge. Lava flowed from its base until mid-June when the lava cut through the north crater wall. The larger cones produced more tephra, occasionally with lightning within the tephra cloud. By July 5 the eruption had stopped. [ Effects ] During eruptions of Hekla fluorine is produced and sticks to the surfaces of the grains of tephra. Fine grains can have a fluorine content of 350  ppm and fluorine poisoning can start in sheep at a diet with fluorine content of 25  ppm. At 250  ppm death can occur within a few days. In 1783, 79% of the Icelandic sheep stock were killed, probably as a result of fluorosis caused by the eruption of Lakagígar. Some of the ash produced in this eruption had a fluorine content of 0.2% and two days after the eruption contaminated grass had a dry weight content of up to 0.4%. 450 farms and 95,000 sheep were affected by the eruption. Some were kept inside and fed on hay or moved but other farmers were forced to graze their flocks outside. Fluorine poisoning killed over 1500 ewes, 6000 lambs and some horses.

It was a mixed eruption producing a lava volume of 0.12  km 3 and a tephra volume of 5.8×10 7  m 3. The fissure opened along a 7  km length. Shortly before the eruption started a steam column was produced, eventually the eruption column reached a height of 15  km. The main tephra deposits were to the NNE and lasted for around 2  hours. Deposits were 20  cm thick 10  km from the summit, decreasing to &lt; 1  mm at the coast 230  km away.Lava was initially produced from close to the summit, spreading to other parts of the fissure and covering an area of 22  km 2 in around 24  hours. The last scoria were seen on the morning of August 20.

The eruption threw ash to a height of 6.6  km and a new crater formed at the summit from which 3 lava flows originated. These extended to a maximum of 4.5  km from the volcano, covering 5–6  km 2. [ 1991 ] A summer 2009 view of Hekla from the side. A larger eruption (VEI 3) occurred from January 17, 1991 to March 11, 1991, producing 0.15  km 3 of lava and 2×10 7  m 3 of tephra. The eruption, which was preceded by sulpherous smells and earthquakes, started as a Plinian eruption, producing an ash cloud reaching an altitude of 11.5  km within 10  minutes which had travelled over 200  km north-northeast to the coast within 3  hours. The eruption then moved quickly to producing andesitic lava, the flows eventually covering an area of 23  km 2 to an average depth of 6–7  m. Initially part of the Heklugja fissure and other fissures erupted with lava fountains reaching 300  m in height. By the second day the activity stopped in all but one fissure where the main crater formed. During these 2  days 800  m 3 s −1 of lava were produced, slowing to between 1  m 3 s −1 and 14  m 3 s −1 for most of the eruption. This low viscosity lava had a SiO 2 content of approximately 54%.

In January 2003, however, a team from the Norvol Institute in Reykjavík, under the leadership of Dr. Ármann Höskuldsson, reported that they found traces of a pyroclastic flow, roughly 5  km long, stretching down the side of the mountain. This will call for a reappraisal of volcanic eruptions of the basic rock type, which up to now were generally thought not to produce large pyroclastic flows. It will also require that the public and curious spectators who always rush to the scene at the start of a new outbreak, be kept much further away from the volcanic activity than was thought necessary during previous outbreaks.

Forest and some grasses are much more resilient to ash and pumice fall than low vegetation, but the combined effect of human habitation and the volcanic activity has left an unstable surface very susceptible to erosion. Hekluskogar, a 90,000  ha reforesting project is running to restore the previously present birch and willow woodland to the slopes of Hekla, starting with soil fertilisation and grass sowing. This would stabilize the large areas of volcanic ash, help to reduce erosion by the wind of the frost heave d surface, slow drainage rates and hence water erosion, and ultimately increase biodiversity. It is the largest reforestation of its type in Europe.
