[ History ] [ April 2007 April 2007 ] McClure owes its stock of fine homes dating from the late 19th century and early 20th century to the growth of rail lines throughout Northwestern Ohio in those days. As it did for its neighbors, Grelton, Malinta, Hamler, Deshler, Holgate, Liberty Center, and Grand Rapids, the railroad brought McClure a means for farmers to get their goods to market. And while farmers were in town, they could patronize local businesses which sold items brought in by rail. The McClure Telephone Company, which dates back to the first days of telephone service in Henry County, in the 1880s, was established during that boom time. For years it was a typical telephone company, but by the 1960s and 1970s, it was becoming an example of a bygone era. McClure residents had the distinction of living in the last Ohio town to have had a manual telephone system. For nearly one hundred years, residents used the same method to signal their town&apos;s operator; they turned a crank and the operator answered, who in most cases knew their voice or knew the person being called. They had phone numbers, like 6, or 328, or 78. But when the operator knows everyone in town, most people rarely used their numbers. When people wanted to talk to someone in the outside world, the would ask the operator for the number, and she&apos;d connect them to the long-distance operator in Bowling Green, who would complete the call. They also had a trunk line to Napeoleon, which could be used if they were calling numbers in that area. Residents in some nearby towns for whom McClure was a local call could dial a single digit (a 7 or 8 for example) and reach the McClure operator, who could complete a call to McClure for them. McClure converted in 1980 to an electronic switching system with all touch-tone phones. The customers found themselves getting used to the new and impersonal equipment, and looking up numbers in phone books. After years of party lines, they were enjoying having private lines. While the phone company remains in McClure and has yet to be consolidated into a larger telecom company, today most of McClure&apos;s businesses are long closed, as are those in most of the boom towns which grew up in the same era as McClure. Today a McClure resident would be likely to drive to Napoleon or Bowling Green to go shopping, or possibly to Toledo. The rail lines which brought so much money into the area are abandoned.
