It was their first record to feature Doug Yule, John Cale &apos;s replacement. It was recorded in 1968 at TTG Studios in Hollywood, California. This album&apos;s softer sound marks a radical shift in approach in style from the group&apos;s previous recordings. In 2003, the album was ranked number 314 on Rolling Stone &apos;s &quot; The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time &quot; list. [ Context ] The group&apos;s leader Lou Reed said &quot; I really didn’t think we should make another White Light/White Heat. I thought it would be a terrible mistake, and I really believed that. I thought we had to demonstrate the other side of us. Otherwise, we would become this one-dimensional thing, and that had to be avoided at all costs. &quot; Maureen Tucker said, &quot; I was pleased with the direction we were going and with the new calmness in the group, and thinking about a good future, hoping people would smarten up and some record company would take us on and do us justice. &quot; Doug Yule said the album &quot; was a lot of fun. The sessions were constructive and happy and creative, everybody was working together. &quot; { Hogan, Peter (1997), The Complete Guide to the Music of the Velvet Underground, p.28 } The Velvet Underground was the band&apos;s first album for MGM Records, the band&apos;s first two albums having been issued by MGM subsidiary and legendary jazz label, Verve Records. The previously strong Andy Warhol influence is diminished, with the most notable ties to The Factory being the cover and back photograph s taken by Warholite Billy Name, and opening track &quot; Candy Says, &quot; written about transsexual Candy Darling (who would later appear in Reed&apos;s 1972 song, &quot; Walk On The Wild Side &quot; ) The song was sung by Yule at Reed&apos;s insistence. The record was produced by the band themselves, and issued in two different stereo mixes. The more widely distributed mix is the one done by MGM/Verve staff recording engineer Val Valentin. The other mix was done by Lou Reed, and was dubbed the &quot; Closet Mix &quot; by guitarist Sterling Morrison. There are many significant sonic differences in the versions. The most dramatic is that &quot; Some Kinda Love &quot; is an entirely different performance from the same recording sessions. The LP sleeve was designed by Dick Smith, then a staff artist at MGM/Verve. [ Release history ] Early copies of the album were released on MGM, but re-issue versions are on Verve. The first U.S. version contained the Lou Reed &quot; Closet Mix, &quot; although the track times listed on the first U.S. issue more closely match the Valentin mix. This may indicate that the Reed mix was issued by mistake or that it was substituted after the covers were printed. The original U.K. release used the Valentin mix. All CD versions, as well as the 1985 vinyl re-issue, are copies of the Valentin mix. Other LP re-issues vary but most also use the Valentin Mix. The &quot; Closet Mix &quot; is available on disc four of the 1995 CD box set Peel Slowly and See.
