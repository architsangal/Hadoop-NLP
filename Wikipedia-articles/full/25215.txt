The game was developed by id Software and featured music composed by Sonic Mayhem and Front Line Assembly. Quake III Arena is the third in the series and differs from previous games by excluding a traditional single-player element and focusing on multi-player action. The single-player is instead played against computer controlled bots in a similar style to Unreal Tournament. Notable features of Quake 3 include the minimalist design, lacking rarely used items and features, the extensive customizability of player settings such as field of view, texture detail and enemy model, and advanced movement features such as strafe- and rocket-jumping. Quake 3 is available on a number of platforms and contains mature content. The game was highly praised by reviewers who, for the most part, described the gameplay as fun and engaging. Many liked the crisp graphics and focus on multiplayer. Quake 3 has also been used extensively in professional electronic sports tournaments such as Quakecon, Cyberathlete Professional League and the Electronic Sports World Cup. [ Gameplay ] Unlike its predecessors, Q3A does not have a plot-based single-player campaign. Instead, it simulates the multiplayer experience with computer controlled players known as bots. The game&apos;s story is brief - &apos;the greatest warriors of all time fight for the amusement of a race called the Vadrigar in the Arena Eternal.&apos; The introduction video shows the abduction of such a warrior, Sarge, while making a last stand. Continuity with prior games in the Quake series and even Doom is maintained by the inclusion of player models related to those earlier games as well as biographical information included on characters in the manual, [ Connors William W. Rivera, Mike; Orzel, Sylvia Quake 3 Arena Manual ] a familiar mixture of gothic and technological map architecture and specific equipment; for example, the Quad Damage power-up, the infamous rocket launcher and the BFG super-weapon. In Quake III Arena the player progresses through tiers of maps, combating different bot characters that increase in difficulty, from Crash (at Tier 0) to Xaero (at Tier 7). As well as tougher opponents the fights take place in more complex arenas as the game progresses. While deathmatch maps are designed for up to 16 players, tournament maps are designed for duels between 2 players and in the single-player game could be considered as &apos; boss battles &apos;. The weapons are balanced by role, with each weapon having advantages in certain situations such as at long-range or fired around a corner; the BFG is an exception to this as a super-weapon. Weapons appear as level items, spawning at regular intervals in set locations on the map. If a player dies all their weapons are lost and they receive the spawn weapons for the current map, usually the gauntlet and machine gun. Players also drop the weapon they were using when killed, which other players can then pick up. Q3A comes with several gameplay modes; Free for All (FFA), a classic deathmatch, where each player competes against the rest for the highest score, Team Deathmatch (TDM), where usually two teams of four compete for the highest team frag total, Tournament (1v1), a deathmatch between two players, usually ending after a set time and Capture the Flag, which is played on symmetrical maps where teams have to recover the enemy flag from the opponents&apos; base while retaining their own. Quake III Arena was specifically designed for multiplayer, the game allows players whose computers are connected by a network or to the internet, to play against each other in real time. It employs a client–server model, requiring all players&apos; clients to connect to a server. Q3A&apos;s focus on multiplayer gameplay spawned a lively community, similar to Quakeworld, that is active to this day. [ Development ] During early March 1999, ATI leaked the internal hardware vendor (IHV) copy of the game. [ http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action%3Dviewthread%26amp%3Bthreadid%3D386 Quake III Arena IHV Test Leaked) Blue&apos;s News 2008-08-12 1999-03-01 ] This was a functional version of the engine with a textured level and working guns. The IHV contained most of the weapons (excepting the Gauntlet) that would make it into the final game although most were not fully modeled; a chainsaw and grappling hook were also in the IHV but did not make it into the final release. Many of the sounds that would make it into the final release were also included. After the IHV fiasco id Software released a beta of the game called Quake III Arena Test on April 24, 1999. The Q3Test started with version 1.05 and included three levels that would be included in the final release: dm7, dm17, and q3tourney2. Id software continued to update Q3Test up until version 1.09. [ http://rr.pc.ign.com/rrview/pc/quake_iii_arena/010794/46709/ A Review of Q3 after the fact) IGN 2008-08-12 2006-07-14 ] During the game&apos;s testing it was found that the lightning gun was too dominating. Its strength was reduced to the point that some players have found it useless. Weapon balance was achieved by examining earlier games in the series, Quake and Quake II as well as extensive play testing with well-known players such as Thresh. In the first Quake the rocket launcher was so effective that it dominated entire deathmatches [ February 2007 ] while the rocket launcher in Quake II so weak that it was sometimes ignored. [ October 2007 ] The rocket launcher in Quake III is effective but not overpowering, allowing it to be countered in many situations. [ October 2007 ] [ Engine ] [ id Tech 3 ] A mirror reflects Sarge and the Quake III logo in the opening scene of the first level, Q3DM0. The id Tech 3 engine is the name now given to the engine that was developed for Quake 3. Unlike most other games released at the time, including its primary competitor, Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 requires an OpenGL -compliant graphics accelerator to run. The game does not include a software renderer. The graphic technology of the game is based tightly around a &quot; shader &quot; system where the appearance of many surfaces can be defined in text files referred to as &quot; shader scripts. &quot; Quake 3 also introduced spline-based curved surfaces in addition to planar volumes, which are responsible for many of the surfaces present within the game. [ http://www.qeradiant.com/manual/Q3AShader_Manual/ch05/pg5_1.htm Quake III Arena Shader Manual 2006-10-01 5 Paul Jaquays, Brian Hook http://web.archive.org/web/20060414004110/http%3A//www.qeradiant.com/manual/Q3AShader_Manual/ch05/pg5_1.htm April 14, 2006 ] Quake 3 also provided support for models animated using vertex animation with attachment tags (known as the.md3 format), allowing models to maintain separate torso and leg animations and hold weapons. Quake 3 is one of the first games where the third-person model is able to look up and down and around as the head, torso and legs are separate. [ February 2007 ] Other visual features include volumetric fog, mirrors, portals, decals, and wave-form vertex distortion. For networking, id Tech 3 uses a &quot; snapshot &quot; system to relay information about game &quot; frames &quot; to the client over UDP. The server attempts to omit as much information as possible about each frame, relaying only differences from the last frame the client confirmed as received ( Delta encoding ). [ http://trac.bookofhook.com/bookofhook/trac.cgi/wiki/Quake3Networking Book of Hook: The Quake3 Networking Model 2006-10-01 ] id Tech 3 uses a virtual machine to control object behavior on the server, effects and prediction on the client and the user interface. This presents many advantages as mod authors do not need to worry about crashing the entire game with bad code, clients could show more advanced effects and game menus than was possible in Quake II and the user interface for mods was entirely customizable. Unless operations which require a specific endianness are used, a QVM file will run the same on any platform supported by Quake 3. The engine also contains bytecode compilers for the x86 and PowerPC architectures, executing QVM instructions via an interpreter. Quake III Arena features an advanced AI with five difficulty levels which can accommodate both a beginner and an advanced player, though they usually do not pose a challenge to high-tier or competitive players. Each bot has its own, often humorous, &apos;personality&apos;, expressed as scripted lines that are triggered to simulate real player chat. If the player were to type certain phrases the bots may respond, typing &quot; You bore me &quot; might cause one of the bots to reply &quot; You should have been here 3 hours ago! &quot;. Each bot has a number of alternative lines to reduce the repetition of bot chatter. The Gladiator bots from Quake II were ported to Quake III and incorporated into the game by their creator - Jean Paul van Waveren, aka Mr. Elusive. { http://members.cox.net/randar/review.html Members.cox.net } [ http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/docs/MSc/2001/Waveren_Jean-Paul_van/thesis.pdf The Quake III Bot, J.P. van Waveren PDF 2011-08-17 ] Bot chat lines were written by R. A. Salvatore, Seven Swords and Steve Winter. [ Quake III Arena Credits http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/192047.html GameFAQs 2007-05-16 ] Xaero, the hardest opponent in the game, was based on the Gladiator bot Zero.

On August 19, 2005, id Software released the complete source code for Quake III Arena under the GNU General Public License, [ http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid%3D05%2F08%2F20%2F1329236%26amp%3Btid%3D112 Quake 3: Arena Source GPL&apos;ed) Slashdot 2008-06-23 2005-08-20 ] as they have for most of their prior engines. As before, the engine, but not the content such as textures and models, were released, so that anyone who wishes to build the game from source will still need an original copy of the game to play it as intended. A project called OpenArena creates open content and bundles it with the engine as a standalone Quake 3 release. Open Arena uses the ioquake3 engine, [ http://openarena.ws/about.html OpenArena Homepage ] which is focused on bug fixes, sound and graphical improvements. [ http://ioquake3.org/ ioquake3 Engine ] [ Expansion ] An expansion pack titled Quake III: Team Arena was released in December 2000 by id Software. It focused on team gameplay through new game modes and new weapons, items, and player models. Team Arena was criticized, as its additions were long overdue and had already been implemented by fan modifications. A few years later Quake III: Gold was released, including the original Quake III Arena and the Team Arena expansion pack bundled together. Front Line Assembly made the soundtrack for the expansion; the counterpart to Sonic Mayhem&apos;s Quake 3 Arena: Noize. [ Ports ] [ Official ] Quake III Arena was released for the Dreamcast (ported by Raster Productions and released by Sega) in 2000 and featured 4 player online play versus Dreamcast and PC gamers. It is often considered one of the best PC to console ports of its time due to its smooth frame rate and online play.

[ Modifications ] Like its predecessors, Quake and Quake II, Quake III Arena can be heavily modified, allowing the engine to be used for many different games. Mods range from small gameplay adjustments like Rocket Arena 3 and Orange Smoothie Productions to total conversions such as Smokin&apos; Guns and DeFRaG. The source code&apos;s release has allowed total conversion mods such as Tremulous, World of Padman, OpenArena and Urban Terror to evolve into standalone free games. Other mods like Weapons Factory Arena have moved to more modern commercial engines.

CPMA includes alternative gameplays, including air-control, rebalanced weapons, instant weapon switching and additional jumping techniques. [ Competitive play ] Quake III Arena&apos;s multiplayer-focused development led to it developing a large community of competitive players and like its predecessors it was used extensively in professional electronic sports tournaments.
