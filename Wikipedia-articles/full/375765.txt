It was described by Captain John G. W. Dillin in the dedication to his seminal 1924 book, The Kentucky Rifle: &quot; From a flat bar of soft iron, hand forged into a gun barrel; laboriously bored and rifled with crude tools; fitted with a stock hewn from a maple tree in the neighboring forest; and supplied with a lock hammered to shape on the anvil; an unknown smith, in a shop long since silent, fashioned a rifle which changed the whole course of world history; made possible the settlement of a continent; and ultimately Freed our country of foreign domination. Light in weight; graceful in line; economical in consumption of powder and lead; fatally precise; distinctly American; it sprang into immediate popularity; and for a hundred years was a model often slightly varied but never radically changed. &quot; [ Dillin John The Kentucky Rifle 1967 George Shumway York,PA 0-87387-072-7 XI ] [ Origins ] The longrifle developed on the American frontier in and about Lancaster, Pennsylvania in the 1740s. [ May 2009 ] It continued to be developed technically and artistically until it passed out of fashion in the second quarter of the 19th century. Strong pockets of longrifle use and manufacture continued in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and North Carolina, however, well into the 20th century as a practical and efficient firearm for those rural segments of the nation. Longrifles could be made entirely by hand and hand-operated tooling, in a frontier setting. Although experts argue the fine points of origin and lineage, it is accepted that the longrifle was the product of German gunsmiths who immigrated to new settlements in Pennsylvania and Virginia as early as the 1620s. [ May 2009 ] Initially the weapon of choice on the frontier was the smooth bore musket or trade gun, built by the thousands in factories in England and France and shipped to the colonies for purchase. [ May 2009 ] Gradually, rifles became more popular due to their longer effective range. While the smooth bore musket had an effective range of less than 100 yards, a rifleman could hit a man-sized target at a range of three hundred yards or more. The price for this accuracy was longer reloading time. While the musket could be reloaded in approximately 20 seconds, the longrifle required up to a minute. [ May 2009 ] Among the earliest documented working rifle makers are Adam Haymaker, who had a thriving trade in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and the Moravian gunshops at Christian&apos;s Spring in Pennsylvania and in the Salem area of North Carolina. [ May 2009 ] All three areas were busy and productive centers of rifle making by the 1750s. The Great Wagon Road was a bustling frontier thoroughfare, and rifle shops traced this same route - from eastern Pennsylvania, down the Shenandoah Valley, and spilling into both the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky and the Yadkin River (Salem) area of North Carolina. [ May 2009 ] Martin Meylin&apos;s (Mylin) Gunshop was built in 1719, and it is here that the Mennonite gunsmith of Swiss-German heritage crafted some the earliest, and possibly the first, Pennsylvania Rifles. { City of Lancaster,PA -- History } The Martin Meylin Gunshop still stands today in Willow Street, Pennsylvania, on Long Rifle Road. { http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=5116 } { http://www.l-spioneers.org/education/school/school.php?sectionid=8 } The Lancaster County Historical Society has an original Pennsylvania Long Rifle smithed by Meylin that was passed down within the family for seven generations before being donated to the society in the middle of the twentieth century. A document describing the history of Meylin, the Gunshop, and archeology of the shop is available online from Millersville University. { http://www.millersville.edu/archaeology/files/mylin-gunshop-site-report.pdf } There is documentation stating that the first high quality &apos;Kentucky rifles&apos; were from a gunsmith named Jacob Deckard, possibly of German, Pennsylvanian, or Virginian background. The name &apos;Deckard Rifle&apos; was considered the brand name and &apos;Kentucky rifle&apos; was the more broadly accepted nickname of this rifle. { http://boards.history.com/topic/American-Revolution/What-Is-A/300001296?messageID=300109360 } The settlers of western Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina soon gained a reputation for hardy independence and rifle marksmanship as a way of life, further reinforced by the performance of riflemen in the American Revolution as well as the War of 1812. [ May 2009 ] In that war, the long rifle gained its more famous nickname the Kentucky Rifle, after a popular song &quot; The Hunters of Kentucky &quot;, about Andrew Jackson and his victory at the Battle of New Orleans. [ December 2008 ] The reason for the American rifle&apos;s characteristic long barrel is a matter of some conjecture. The German gunsmiths working in America would have been very familiar with German rifles, which seldom had barrels longer than [ 30 in mm ]. The longer barrel gave the black powder more time to burn, increasing the muzzle velocity and accuracy. A rule of thumb used by some gunsmiths was to make the rifle no longer than the height of a customer&apos;s chin because of the necessity of seeing the muzzle while loading. The longer barrel also allowed for finer sighting. Some speculation is that a longer gun was easier to load from horseback by resting the butt of the rifle on the ground. This was not a consideration, as the rifles were not exclusively used from horseback, and making rifles long enough to be loaded in this fashion would make them inconveniently long to be loaded while on foot. Regardless of the reason, by the 1750s it was common to see frontiersmen carrying the new and distinctive style of rifle. [ May 2009 ] [ The Rifle Evolves into new forms ] In 1792 the US Army began to modify the Kentucky Rifle, shortening the barrel length to 42  inches in their 1792 contract rifle. The Lewis and Clark expedition carried an even shorter version, 33-36  inches, similar to the Harpers Ferry Model 1803 which began production six months after Lewis paid the arsenal a visit. Both the contract rifles and the Model 1803 resemble what became the plains rifle. The &quot; Plains Rifle &quot; or &quot; Hawken rifle &quot; was a shorter, carbine variant. It was popular among mountain men and North American fur trappers in the 19th century. { The Hawken brothers were only one of a number of famous gunsmiths active in St. Louis in the 1830&apos;s-1860&apos;s. Dozens of renowned gunsmiths such as Horace (H.E.) Dimick and J. P. Gemmer produced powerful and portable &quot; short &quot; long rifles for the Rocky Mountain fur trade, overland exploration, and the trans-continental immigrant trains. The Plains Rifle combined accuracy with portability, in a more compact package than the extreme long guns from which it evolved. While many Plains Rifles were built to fire heavy rounds against dangerous game, more were chambered around the.40 calibre range for medium game hunting. } Kentucky Rifles tended to be slimmer and more elegant than the later, more massive, and shorter-barreled Hawken variant rifles. The Hawken rifles evolved from the Kentucky Rifle for use against larger, more dangerous game encountered in the American West. For firing heavier and larger diameter bullets and heavier powder loads, the barrel wall thickness was necessarily strengthened, and the barrel length of the Hawken was shortened to keep the carrying weight manageable. [ May 2009 ] [ Characteristics ] Artistically, the longrifle is known for its graceful stock, often made of curly maple, and its ornate decoration, decorative inlays, and an integral, well-made patchbox that was built into the stock. { Willis, Chuck. Weaponry: an illustrated history. New York: Hylas Publishing, 2006. 90-91. } The decorative arts of furniture making, painting, silver smithing, gunsmithing, etc. all took their style cues from the prevailing trends of the day, and as in most things the fashion was set in Paris. Baroque and later rococo motifs found their way into all the decorative arts, and can be seen in the acanthus leaf scroll work so common on 18th century furniture and silver. The best American longrifles have art applied to them that is the equal of any Philadelphia cabinet or silver shop. Many people also would give their rifles names such as &quot; Killdeer &quot;, the rifle of Natty Bumppo from the Leatherstocking Tales. [ May 2009 ] Originally rather plain, by the 1770s every surface of the rifle could have applied artwork. [ May 2009 ] An accomplished gunsmith had to be a skilled blacksmith, whitesmith, wood carver, brass and silver founder, engraver, and wood finisher. European shops at the time had significant specialization of the trades, leading to separate tradesmen building each rifle. The American frontier had no such luxury, and quite often only one gunmaker, would make the entire rifle, a process almost unheard of in 18th century trade practice. The flintlock action, with its spring mechanism, and single-action trigger, though, was often purchased in bulk by gunsmiths from England, and then fabricated with skill into an elaborate rifle. Early locks were nearly always imported but domestic manufacturing of locks arose in America among the most skilled gunsmiths in later years. [ May 2009 ] To conserve lead on the frontier, smaller calibers were often preferred, ranging often from about.36 to.45 cal. [ May 2009 ] As a rifle became worn from use, with accumulated corrosion from firing blackpowder causing the bore to enlarge, it was not uncommon to see many rifles re-bored and re-rifled to larger calibers, to keep the rifle shooting accurately. Many copies of historical Kentucky Rifles are seen with a bore of around.50 caliber. [ May 2009 ] The longrifle is said by modern experts to have a range of 80 to 100 yards. [ May 2009 ] This figure is meant for the normal or novice user. A trained, experienced shooter who knows how to take variables into account such as (gunpowder) load, windage, drop, etc. can easily extend the median range of the long rifle to 400-500 yards. [ May 2009 ] In 1778 at the siege of Boonesborough, Kentucky, one of the officers of the combined British/Shawnee assault force was hiding behind a tree. He stuck his head out from behind the tree and was instantly killed by a ball to the forehead fired by Daniel Boone, who was known for always firing the same fixed measure load of blackpowder in his rifle. This shot was later confirmed by witnesses on both sides and the distance measured at 250 yards. Hitting a target so precisely at that range would probably make the Kentucky Rifle comparable in total effective (long) range with the British Baker rifle at 700 to 800 yards. [ May 2009 ] Although less commonly owned or seen on the frontier, the Kentucky Rifle style was also used on flintlock pistols during the same era. [ May 2009 ] These Kentucky Rifle style pistols were often matched in caliber to a Kentucky Rifle owned by the same user, to enable firing a common-sized and common-patched round lead ball. [ May 2009 ] With the same graceful stock lines and barrel style, and craftsmanship, they were noticeably slimmer and had a longer rifled barrel with better sights than had been seen on the earlier Colonial style flintlock pistols. Dueling pistol sets in the Kentucky Rifle style were also made, sometimes in a cased set, for wealthy gentlemen. [ May 2009 ] [ Decline and rebirth ] By the 20th century, there was little traditional long rifle making left except in isolated pockets in the Appalachian mountains. [ Kendall Arthur Rifle Making in the Great Smoky Mountains 1941 National Park Service http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/popular/13/index.htm ] [ May 2009 ] Few men were left who could build a long rifle. Popular interest in shooting as a sport as well as the sesquicentennial of the United States&apos; independence from Britain in 1925-33 spurred interest in the origins of the American longrifle. One of the first evidences of this renewed interest was the seminal work in 1924 by Capt. John Dillon; The Kentucky Rifle. Early 20th century pioneers of longrifle culture were Walter Cline, Horace Kephart, Ned Roberts, Red Farris, Hacker Martin, Bill Large, Jack Weichold, Ben Hawkins, D.C. Addicks, L.M. Wolf, Dave Taylor, Win Woods, and Alvin Wagner. [ Schiffer Tom The Origins and Development of Longrifle Culture, Part 1 Muzzle Blasts 2011 August 27 12 4–10 ] [ May 2009 ] Many men throughout the remainder of the 20th century worked to expand our knowledge of the American Longrifle and how to recreate it in the 18th and 19th century manner. Foremost among these were Joe Kindig Jr, George Shumway, Earl Lanning, Wallace Gusler, John Bivins, Garry Brumfield and many others. In 1965, Wallace Gusler, as the fist master of the Gunsmith shop in Colonial Williamsburg, was the first to recreate an American longrifle in modern times using 18th century tools and techniques. The 1968 film &quot; Gunsmith of Williamsburg &quot; documented the production of his second, all handmade, longrifle. [ Wallace Gusler Three Centuries of Tradition: The Renaissance of Custom Sporting Arms in America 2003 The Minneapolis Institute of Arts Minneapolis, MN 1-85759-289-1 74 ] This film has been re-released on DVD and is available from a number of online sources. Since that time, many other makers have trained by these men and many other pioneers of the rebirth of the longrifle culture. The Gunsmith Shop in Colonial Williamsburg under Wallace Gusler and Gary Brumfield produced Dave Wagoner, Jon Laubach, George Suiter, Clay Smith, and Richard Frazier. These are the only men who have emerged from the Gunshop to date who have produced an all handmade rife. [ Gusler Wallace Three Centuries of Tradition:The Renaissance of Custom Sporting Arms in America 2003 The Minneapolis Institute of Arts Minneapolis,MN 1-85759-289-1 72 ] In addition to his influence in his popular series of articles for Rifle Magazine [ Wolfe Dave Gunsmithing Tips &amp; Projects 1989 Wolfe Publishing Company Prescott, Arizona 0-935632-81-6 66–71,115–161. 184–194 ] and his involvement with the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts (MESDA) John Bivins trained the outstanding gunmakers Jim Chambers and Mark Silver. Then there were other standouts like Earl Lanning, Keith Casteel, Hershel and Frank House, Jack Brooks, Jud Brennon, Ron Ehlert, Robert Harn, and many more. Their work and that of others can be seen in the book: Three Centuries of Tradition: The Renaissance of Custom Sporting Arms in America, published by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts and Scala Publishers, Ltd. [ Silver Mark Three Centuries of Tradition: The Renaissance of Custom Sporting Arms in America 2003 The Minneapolis Institute of Arts Minneapolis, MN 1-85759-289-1 74–127 ] While there have been many great builders over the past 50 years who have helped revive the recreation of the historically correct American longrifle, there are many talented newer builders such as Allen Martin, Eric Kettenburg, Jim Kibler, Mark Whealand and others. There are more and more builders all the time as evidenced by AmericanLongrifles.org, a group of forums serving the interests of builders of traditional muzzleloading arms, with over 3000 members including most of the top builders alive today. [ AmericanLongrifles.org http://www.americanlongrifles.org/forum/ ] AmericanLongrifles.org(ALR) was started in 1997 by Mark Elliott at same time that Gordon Barlow was creating the Contemporary Longrifle Association (CLA). The CLA is a membership organization consisting of students, collectors, and artisans producing contemporary(20th century and later) hand made recreations of American longrifles, their accoutrements, and associated arms and crafts of pre-1840 America. [ Contemparyary Longrifle Association http://www.longrifle.com/ ] The overflow crowds that fill the Lexington,KY Convention Center each August for the CLA annual meeting and show is evidence of the popularity of the contemporary American longrifle and traditional crafts. There are also large suppliers for muzzleloading supplies such as Dixie Gun Works [ Dixie Gun Works http://www.dixiegunworks.com/ ] and Track of the Wolf [ Track of the Wolf http://www.trackofthewolf.com/ ] as proof of the vibrancy of the contemporary longrifle.

Then there are hundreds of other individual artisans producing small parts and supplies for resale by the like of Track of the Wolf, Dixie Gunworks, Dixons Muzzleloading Shop, Stonewall Creek Outfitters, Tip Curtis, and others. The recreation of the American longrifle continues.

Texarkana, Texas 1-880655-13-6 ] [ In popular culture ] The 1955 film Kentucky Rifle gravitates around a trail wagon containing one hundred longrifles. The gun, which is actually the main star of that movie, is displayed under every angle and is even the object of lyric descriptive monologues by veteran actor Chill Wills. On the show Antiques Roadshow an 1810 Kentucky Rifle was appraised at $ 20,000 The 1826 novel by James Fenimore Cooper The Last of the Mohicans (and the films based on it ) features a longrifle wielding character Hawkeye (played in the 1992 film by Daniel Day-Lewis ) who is nicknamed by other characters as Le Longue Carabine ( &quot; LongRifle &quot; ) The Kentucky Longrifle was featured in the fifth episode of History Channel &apos;s reality television show Top Shot. The rifle was used by George Washington &apos;s forces in the first episode of the third season Deadliest Warrior.
