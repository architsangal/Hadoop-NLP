[ History ] Upper Nyack was incorporated in 1872. Two hundred years prior, Claus Jansen Purarent of Bergen Township (now Jersey City ) received a patent from Governor Phillip Carteret for [ 640 acre ] of land north of Tappan. Jansen sold [ 100 acre ] to Dowe Harmensen Tallman, and the rest was inherited by his son Cornelius Clausen, who assumed the surname of Kuyper (Cooper). Kuyper was an outstanding public servant in the County of Orange. The first Upper Nyacker also commanded the first company of militia in the county. He died in 1731 and is buried in the Upper Nyack Burial Grounds. Following the extension of the Northern Railroad of New Jersey into the area in the mid-19th century, rapid growth ensued. Town government no longer being seen as an effective means of dealing with the needs of Nyack proper, village incorporation was discussed. Fearing higher taxes, those in what would have become the northern part of Nyack village formed their own municipal corporation first, named Upper Nyack. Nyack village still incorporated, too, although without this northern portion.

The slogan &quot; Goosetown against the world &quot; was adopted in 1909 due to a local dispute.
