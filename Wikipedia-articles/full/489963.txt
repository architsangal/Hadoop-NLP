with Russia [ Tennis records ] He played exclusively with and endorsed racquets from Austrian company Fischer throughout his career. One of seven players to beat Roger Federer at Wimbledon; the other six being Jiri Novak (1999), Tim Henman (2001), Mario Ancic (2002), Rafael Nadal (2008), Tomáš Berdych (2010) and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (2011). In the episode of Sports Night &quot; Shane &quot;, Dan and Jeremy spend over an hour recording and rerecording a ten-second commercial voiceover because Dan cannot say Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Kafelnikov is the only male player in the open era to have won two or more Grand Slam singles titles without also winning a Masters Series title, despite having reached five Masters Series finals. Kafelnikov owns the best career winning percentage against Roger Federer amongst those with more than four matches against him. Kafelnikov is 4–2 against Federer, joined by Àlex Corretja, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray as the only players with winning records against Federer in more than four matches. See: Roger Federer career statistics. [ Other interests ] Kafelnikov is an avid supporter of Russian football side Dynamo Moscow FC, and was given &apos;lifetime membership&apos; of the club by Chairman Victor Zakharov in 2003, and as a result is a registered player for both the football team, and the basketball team. He has, however, never played any games for either team as yet. Kafelnikov is now a keen semi-professional golfer, who is in close contact with Russia&apos;s only qualified golf professional, Mark Nichols, who lives in Moscow, but is originally from England. He also obtained a wildcard entry into the 2005 Cadillac Russian Open golf tournament, in Moscow, shooting rounds of 88 and 96 to finish 40 over par and missed the cut by 24 strokes.

In the Play Station 2 version, he has a strong backhand. On the arcade version, he is an all-around player; this attribute led to him being paired alongside Serena Williams by Chris Lambert and Harry Whittle (mentored by Richard Brown) in their completion of the game at St Catherine&apos;s College, Oxford. The machine had previously been unbeaten since its introduction to the JCR in 2002.
