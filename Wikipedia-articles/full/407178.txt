Retrieved April 16, 2011. } The Day After Tomorrow is a 2004 American science-fiction disaster film depicting catastrophic effects of global warming in a series of extreme weather events that usher in global cooling and leads to a new ice age. The film did well at the box office, grossing $542,771,772 internationally. Domestically, it is the sixth highest grossing movie not to be #1 in the US box office (behind My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Alvin and the Chipmunks and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes, and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs ), but worldwide, it is third behind only Ice Age 3 and Casino Royale. The movie was filmed in Montreal, and is the highest grossing Hollywood film in history to be filmed in Canada (if adjusted for inflation ). The Day After Tomorrow premiered in Mexico City on May 17, 2004 and was released worldwide from May 26 to May 28 except in South Korea and Japan, where it was released June 4 and June 5, respectively. The film was originally planned for release in the summer of 2003. The film made $110,000,000 in global DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to $654,771,772. { &quot; Lee&apos;s Movie Info - DVD Sales Chart - 2004 Full Year &quot;. Lee&apos;sMovieInfo.net.

They are drilling for ice core samples on the Larsen Ice Shelf for the NOAA when the shelf breaks off and Jack almost falls to his death. Later in New Delhi, Jack presents his findings on global warming at a United Nations conference, where diplomats and Vice President of the United States Raymond Becker ( Kenneth Welsh ) are unconvinced by Jack&apos;s findings. However, Professor Terry Rapson ( Ian Holm ) of the Hedland Climate Research Centre in Scotland believes in Jack&apos;s theories. Several buoy s in the North Atlantic simultaneously show a massive drop in the ocean temperature, and Rapson concludes that melting polar ice is disrupting the North Atlantic current. He contacts Jack, whose paleoclimatological weather model shows how climate changes caused the first Ice Age, and can predict what will happen. Jack thought the events would take hundreds or thousands of years, but his team, along with NASA &apos;s meteorologist Janet Tokada ( Tamlyn Tomita ), builds a forecast model with their combined data. Across the world, violent weather causes mass destruction, including a massive snowstorm in New Delhi, a powerful hailstorm striking Tokyo, Japan, and a series of devastating tornado es in Los Angeles. President Blake ( Perry King ) authorizes the FAA to suspend all air traffic due to severe turbulence. At the International Space Station (ISS) three astronauts see a huge storm system spanning the northern hemisphere, delaying their returning home. The situation worsens when the latter develops into three massive hurricane -like super storm s with eye s holding super-cooled air that instantly freezes anything it comes in contact with. Jack&apos;s theories become reality in seven to ten days&apos; time. Meanwhile, Jack&apos;s son Sam ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) is in New York City for an academic competition with his friends Brian and Laura ( Arjay Smith and Emmy Rossum ), where they also befriend a student named J.D. ( Austin Nichols ). On the flight over there is severe turbulence and Sam grabs Laura&apos;s hand in fright. During the competition, birds migrating south suddenly fill the sky as animals all over New York become agitated. The weather becomes increasingly violent with intense winds and rains, causing the traffic-jammed Manhattan streets to become flooded knee-deep in a mix of rainwater, saltwater, and sewage. Sam calls his father, promising to be on the next train home, but the subways and Grand Central Terminal are closed due to flooding. As the storm worsens a massive tidal wave hits Manhattan, causing major flooding and killing thousands in the chaos. Sam and his friends seek shelter in the New York Public Library, but not before Laura gets wounded, cutting her leg on a submerged taxicab. While survivors in the northern United States are forced to stay inside due to the cold, President Blake orders the evacuation of the southern states, causing almost all of the refugees to head to Mexico. Initially Mexico closes its US border, but President Blake negotiates to open the border. Jack and his team set out for Manhattan to find his son. Their truck crashes into a tractor just past Philadelphia, so the group continues on snowshoes. During the journey, Frank falls through the glass roof of a snow-covered shopping mall. As Jason and Jack try to pull Frank up, the glass under them continues to crack and Frank sacrifices himself by cutting the rope and falling to the floor far below. Meanwhile in Mexico, Vice President Raymond Becker hears from the Secretary of State that President Blake&apos;s motorcade was caught in one of the super storms before he could make it to Mexico, so Becker is sworn in as the new President. Inside the library, Sam warns everyone to stay indoors, but few listen. The small group that remains burns books to stay alive and breaks the vending machine for food. Laura appeared to have a cold, so Sam comforts her and later confesses that he joined the team because he held feelings for Laura. Laura and Sam share a kiss. Soon after, the group find out that Laura is afflicted with blood poisoning due to her cut leg being infected by the sewage-tainted water. So Sam, Brian and J.D. search for penicillin in a derelict Russian cargo ship that drifted inland, and are attacked by starving wolves that had escaped from the local zoo. The eye of the super storm begins to pass over the city, instantly freezing everything from the top-down. The three barely get back to the library with the medicine, food and supplies they were able to scavenge. During the deep freeze, Jack and Jason take shelter in an abandoned Wendy&apos;s restaurant, then resume their journey after the astronauts confirm the storm&apos;s dissipation, finally arriving in New York City. They discover the library buried in snow, but find Sam&apos;s group alive. They radio this in and the President orders in Black Hawk helicopters. President Becker orders search and rescue teams to look for other survivors (having been given hope by the survival of Sam&apos;s group) as he gives his first address to the nation. As the main characters are evacuated and flown over the city, they see that hundreds of other helicopters searching for more survivors find success as people from other skyscrapers flock to the roofs, looking for a ride to safety. The movie concludes with the astronaut s looking down at Earth from the Space Station, showing most of the northern hemisphere covered in ice and snow, with one of the astronauts calling it &quot; the clearest atmosphere [he&apos;s] ever seen. &quot; [ Cast ] Dennis Quaid as Professor Jack Hall, government climatologist and father of Sam Hall.

[ Production ] The movie was inspired by The Coming Global Superstorm, a book co-authored by Coast to Coast AM talk radio host Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. Strieber also wrote the film&apos;s novelization. The book &quot; The Sixth Winter &quot; written by Douglas Orgill and John Gribbin and published in 1979, follows a similar theme. So does the novel Ice!, by Arnold Federbush, published in 1978. Shortly before and during the release of the movie, members of environmental and political advocacy groups distributed pamphlets to moviegoers describing what they believed to be the possible effects of global warming. Although the film depicts some effects of global warming predicted by scientists, such as rising sea levels, more destructive storms, and disruption of ocean currents and weather patterns, it depicts these events happening much more rapidly and severely than is considered scientifically plausible, and the theory that a &quot; superstorm &quot; will create rapid worldwide climate change does not appear in the scientific literature. When the film was playing in theaters, much criticism was directed at U.S. politicians concerning their rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and climate change. The film&apos;s scientific adviser was Dr. Michael Molitor, a leading climate change consultant who worked as a negotiator on the Kyoto Protocol. [ Reception ] The Day After Tomorrow generated mixed reviews from both the science and entertainment communities. The online entertainment guide, Rotten Tomatoes, rated the film at 45%, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site&apos;s general consensus states that it was &quot; A ludicrous popcorn flick filled with clunky dialogues, but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster. &quot; { &quot; The Day After Tomorrow Movie Reviews &quot;. } { Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved April 16, 2011. } Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, praised the film&apos;s special effects, giving the film three stars out of four.

Hyde&apos;s review criticized the film&apos;s portrayal of weather phenomena that stopped at national borders, and finished by saying that it was &quot; to climate science as Frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery &quot;, as quoted in New Scientist.

[ Criticism ] There was some controversy regarding the casting of Kenneth Welsh as the Vice-President of the United States due to his striking physical resemblance to then Vice-President Dick Cheney. Roland Emmerich later confirmed that he deliberately chose Welsh for that very reason. Emmerich stated that the characters of the President and Vice-President in the film were intended to be a not-so-subtle criticism of the environmental policies of the Presidency of George W. Bush. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the film. { Bowles, Scott. (May 26, 2004). &quot; &apos;The Day After Tomorrow&apos; heats up a political debate &quot;. USAToday.com. Retrieved on January 12, 2009. } In response to accusations of insensitivity by including scenes of New York City being devastated less than three years after the September 11 attacks, Emmerich claims that it was necessary to depict the event as a means to showcase the increased unity people now have when facing a disaster, because of 9/11.

Schrag, a paleoclimatologist and professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University, expressed both support and concern about the film, stating that &quot; On the one hand, I&apos;m glad that there&apos;s a big-budget movie about something as critical as climate change. On the other, I&apos;m concerned that people will see these over-the-top effects and think the whole thing is a joke... We are indeed experimenting with the Earth in a way that hasn&apos;t been done for millions of years. But you&apos;re not going to see another ice age – at least not like that. &quot; Marshall Shepherd, a research meteorologist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center expressed similar sentiments, stating that &quot; I&apos;m heartened that there&apos;s a movie addressing real climate issues. But as for the science of the movie, I&apos;d give it a D minus or an F. And I&apos;d be concerned if the movie was made to advance a political agenda. &quot; Andrew Weaver, a climatologist at the University of Victoria said, &quot; It&apos;s The Towering Inferno of climate science movies, but I&apos;m not losing any sleep over a new ice age, because it&apos;s impossible. &quot; [ Home media &lt; template type= &quot; Anchor &quot; &gt; &lt; arg &gt; &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; arg &gt; DVD &lt; /arg &gt; &lt; /template &gt; ] [ Releases ] The Day After Tomorrow was first released on DVD in North America on October 12, 2004, in both widescreen and full screen versions.
