[ http://www.euronext.com/fic/000/050/871/508718.pdf PDF Rules for the CAC 40 Index Euronext January 2009 2009-12-17 ] From the top 100 companies in this ranking, forty are chosen to enter the CAC 40 such that it is &quot; a relevant benchmark for portfolio management &quot; and &quot; a suitable underlying asset for derivatives products &quot;. If a company has more than one class of shares traded on the exchange, only the most actively traded of these will be accepted into the index (generally this will be the ordinary share). [ Weighting ] The CAC 40 is a market value-weighted index. The number of shares issued (used to calculate the market cap and hence the index weight) of a company is reviewed quarterly, on the third Friday of March, June, September and December. Since December 2003, the index weightings of companies in the index have been capped at 15% at each quarterly index review, but these range freely with share price subsequently. A capping factor is used to limit the weights to 15% (if necessary), and is reviewed annually by the Index Steering Committee on the third Friday of September. [ Calculation ] The index value I of the CAC 40 index is calculated using the following formula: I_t = 1000\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N Q_{i,t}\,F_{i,t}\,f_{i,t}\,C_{i,t}\,}{K_t\,\sum_{i=1}^N Q_{i,0}\,C_{i,0}\,} with t the day of calculation; N the number of constituent shares in the index (usually 40); Q i,t the number of shares of company i on day t; F i,t the free float factor of share i; f i,t the capping factor of share i (exactly 1 for all companies not subject to the 15% cap); C i,t the price of share i on day t; Q i,0 the number of shares of company i on the index base date; C i,0 the price of equity i on the index base date; and K t the &quot; adjustment coefficient for base capitalization &quot; on day t (reflecting the switch from the French franc to the Euro in 1999). [ Holdings ] Although the CAC 40 is almost exclusively composed of French-domiciled companies, about 45% of its listed shares are owned by foreign investors, more than any other main European index.

Jacques Chirac, President of the Republic, following the European Council (excerpts) 24 March 2006 27 September 2010 ] German, Japan ese, American and British investors are amongst the most significant holders of CAC 40 shares. This large percentage is due to the fact that CAC 40 companies are more international, or multinational, than any other European market. CAC 40 companies conduct over two thirds of their business and employ over two thirds of their workforce outside France.
