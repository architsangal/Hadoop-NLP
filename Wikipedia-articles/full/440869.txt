Drawings of horses from Chauvet Cave The Chauvet-Pont-d&apos;Arc Cave in the Ardèche department of southern France is a cave that contains some of the earliest known cave paintings, as well as other evidence of Upper Paleolithic life. { Clottes (2003b), p. 214. } It is located near the commune of Vallon-Pont-d&apos;Arc on a limestone cliff above the former bed of the Ardèche River. Discovered on December 18, 1994, it is considered one of the most significant prehistoric art sites. The cave was first explored by a group of three speleologists : Eliette Brunel-Deschamps, Christian Hillaire, and Jean-Marie Chauvet, for whom it was named. Chauvet (1996) has a detailed account of the discovery. In addition to the paintings and other human evidence, they also discovered fossil ized remains, prints, and markings from a variety of animals, some of which are now extinct. Further study by French archaeologist Jean Clottes has revealed much about the site, though the dating has been the matter of some dispute. [ Features ] The cave is situated above the previous course of the Ardèche River before the Pont d&apos;Arc opened up. The gorges of the Ardèche region are the site of numerous caves, many of them having some geological or archaeological importance. The Chauvet Cave is uncharacteristically large and the quality, quantity, and condition of the artwork found on its walls have been called spectacular. Based on radiocarbon dating, the cave appears to have been used by humans during two distinct periods: the Aurignacian and the Gravettian. { See the section on } { Dating. } Most of the artwork dates to the earlier, Aurignacian, era (30,000 to 32,000 years ago). The later Gravettian occupation, which occurred 25,000 to 27,000 years ago, left little but a child&apos;s footprints, the charred remains of ancient hearths and carbon smoke stains from torches that lit the caves. After the child&apos;s visit to the cave, evidence suggests that due to a landslide which covered its historical entrance, the cave had been untouched until it was discovered in 1994. { Curtis, Gregory, The Cave Painters: Probing the Mysteries of the World&apos;s First Artists. Knopf: New York, NY, USA, 2006, pp. 215-216 } The footprints may be the oldest human footprints that can be dated accurately. The soft, clay-like floor of the cave retains the paw prints of cave bear s along with large, rounded, depressions that are believed to be the &quot; nests &quot; where the bears slept. Fossilized bones are abundant and include the skulls of cave bears and the horned skull of an ibex. { Smithsonian Magazine, December 2010 } [ Paintings ] Paintings in the Chauvet Cave { Steppe Wisent (&apos;&apos;Bison priscus&apos;&apos;). Paintings in the Chauvet Cave on } { Post stamp of } { Romania 2001 } Hundreds of animal paintings have been catalogued, depicting at least 13 different species, including some rarely or never found in other ice age paintings. Rather than depicting only the familiar herbivores that predominate in Paleolithic cave art, i.e. horses, cattle, mastodons, mammoths, etc., the walls of the Chauvet Cave feature many predator y animals, e.g., cave lions, panthers, bears, and cave hyena s. Typical of most cave art, there are no paintings of complete human figures, although there is one partial &quot; Venus &quot; figure composed of a vulva attached to an incomplete pair of legs. Above the Venus and in contact with it is a bison head, which has led some to describe the composite drawing as a chimera. There are a few panels of red ochre hand prints and hand stencil s made by spitting pigment over hands pressed against the cave surface. Abstract markings —lines and dots —are found throughout the cave. There are also two unidentifiable images that have a vaguely butterfly shape to them. This combination of subjects has led experts in prehistoric art and cultures to believe that there was likely a ritual, shaman ic, or magical aspect to these paintings. [ May 2012 ] The artists who produced these unique paintings used techniques rarely found in other cave art. Many of the paintings appear to have been made only after the walls were scraped clear of debris and concretions, leaving a smoother and noticeably lighter area upon which the artists worked. Similarly, a three-dimensional quality and the suggestion of movement are achieved by incising or etching around the outlines of certain figures. The art is also exceptional for its time for including &quot; scenes, &quot; e.g., animals interacting with each other; a pair of wooly rhinoceroses, for instance, are seen butting horns in an apparent contest for territory or mating rights. [ Dating ] The cave contains some of the oldest known cave painting s, based on radiocarbon dating of &quot; black from drawings, from torch marks and from the floors &quot;, according to Jean Clottes. Clottes concludes that the &quot; dates fall into two groups, one centred around 27,000 - 26,000 BP and the other around 32,000 - 30,000 BP. &quot; As of 1999, the dates of 31 samples from the cave had been reported. The earliest, sample Gifa 99776 from &quot; zone 10 &quot;, dates to 32,900±490 BP. { Clottes (2003b), p. 33. See also Chauvet (1996), p. 131, for a chronology of dates from various caves. Bahn&apos;s foreword and Clottes&apos; epilogue to Chauvet (1996) discuss dating. } However, some archaeologists have questioned these dates. Christian Züchner, relying on stylistic comparisons with similar paintings at other well-dated sites, is of the opinion that the red paintings are from the Gravettian period (c. 28,000 – 23,000 BP) and the black paintings are from the Early Magdalenian period (early part of c. 18,000–10,000 BP).

The radiocarbon dates from these samples suggest that there were two periods of creation in Chauvet: 35,000 years ago and 30,000 years ago. [ A Chauvet Primer Archaeology 64 2 March/April 2011 39 http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/archaeology/20110304/index.php?startid%3D39 ] A research article published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May 2012 by the scientists from the University of Savoy, Aix-Marseille University and the Centre National de Prehistoire confirmed that the paintings were created by the people in the Aurignacian era, between 30,000 and 32,000 years ago. The researchers’ findings are based on the analysis using geomorphological and chlorine-36 dating of the rockslide surfaces around what is believed to be the cave’s only entrance. Their analysis showed that the entrance was sealed by a collapsing cliff some 29,000 years ago. Their findings put the date of human presence in the cave and the paintings in line with that deduced from radiocarbon dating, i.e., between 30,000–32,000 years BP.

Access is severely restricted owing to the experience with decorated caves such as Lascaux found in the 20th century, where the admission of visitors on a large scale led to the growth of mold on the walls that damaged the art in places. Currently there are plans to create a facsimile of Chauvet Cave, on the model of the so-called &quot; Faux Lascaux &quot;, that would be open to the general public.
