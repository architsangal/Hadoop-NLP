Her novel The Good Earth was the best-selling fiction book in the U.S. in 1931 and 1932, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. In 1938, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, &quot; for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces. &quot; { Meyers, Mike. &quot; Pearl of the Orient, &quot; &apos;&apos;New York Times. March 5, 2006. } [ Life ] { Pearl Buck Birthplace in Hillsboro, West Virginia } Pearl Buck was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia, to Caroline Stulting (1857–1921) and Absalom Sydenstricker. Her parents, Southern Presbyterian missionaries, traveled to China soon after their marriage on July 8, 1880, but returned to the United States for Pearl&apos;s birth. When Pearl was three months old, the family returned to China to be stationed first in Zhenjiang (then often known as Jingjiang or, in the Postal Romanization, Tsingkiang). [ David Shavit Greenwood Publishing Group 1990 0-313-26788-X The United States in Asia: a historical dictionary http://books.google.com.au/books?id%3DIWdZTaJdc6UC 480 ] { (Entry for &quot; Sydenstricker, Absalom &quot; ) } Pearl was raised in a bilingual environment, tutored in English by her mother and in classical Chinese by a Mr. Kung. { Peter Conn, Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography, Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1996) 9, 19–23. } Chinese man in Zhenjiang, c. 1900 The Boxer Uprising greatly affected Pearl and family; their Chinese friends deserted them, and Western visitors decreased. In 1911, Pearl left China to attend Randolph-Macon Woman&apos;s College in Lynchburg, Virginia, US, { Randolph-Macon Woman&apos;s College } graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1914 and a member of Kappa Delta Sorority. From 1914 to 1933, she served as a Presbyterian missionary, but her views later became highly controversial in the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy, leading to her resignation. { Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70–82. } In 1914, Pearl returned to China. She married an agricultural economist, John Lossing Buck (hereafter in this article Pearl Buck is referred to simply as &apos;Buck&apos;), on May 13, 1917, and they moved to Suzhou, Anhui Province, a small town on the Huai River (not to be confused with the better-known Suzhou in Jiangsu Province). It is this region she described later in The Good Earth and Sons. From 1920 to 1933, the Bucks made their home in Nanking (Nanjing), on the campus of Nanjing University, where both had teaching positions. Buck taught English literature at the University of Nanking,金陵大学 and the National Central University,国立中央大学 (renamed to Nanjing University, 南京大学 in 1949). In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, afflicted with phenylketonuria. In 1921, Buck&apos;s mother died and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck&apos;s year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned her Masters degree from Cornell University. In 1925, the Bucks adopted Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China. The tragedies and dislocations that Buck suffered in the 1920s reached a climax in March 1927, during the &quot; Nanking Incident. &quot; In a confused battle involving elements of Chiang Kai-shek &apos;s Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several Westerners were murdered. Since her father Absalom was a missionary, the family decided to stay in Nanjing until the battle reached the city. When violence broke out, a poor Chinese family allowed them to hide in their hut while the family house was looted. The family spent a day terrified and in hiding, after which they were rescued by American gunboats. They traveled to Shanghai and then sailed to Japan, where they stayed for a year. { Buck, Pearl S. The Good Earth. Ed. Peter Conn. New York: Washington Square Press, 1994. Pp. xviii–xix. } They later moved back to Nanjing, though conditions remained dangerously unsettled. In 1934, they left China permanently. In 1935 the Bucks were divorced. Richard Walsh, president of the John Day Company and Pearl Buck&apos;s publisher, became her second husband. Walsh offered her advice and affection which, her biographer concludes, &quot; helped make Pearl&apos;s prodigious activity possible. &quot; The couple lived in Pennsylvania until his death in 1960. { Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 345. } During the Cultural Revolution, Buck, as a preeminent American writer of Chinese peasant life, was denounced as an &quot; American cultural imperialist. &quot; Buck was &quot; heartbroken &quot; when Madame Mao and high-level Chinese officials prevented her from visiting China with Richard Nixon in 1972. Pearl S. Buck died of lung cancer on March 6, 1973, in Danby, Vermont and was interred in Green Hills Farm in Perkasie, Pennsylvania. She designed her own tombstone. The grave marker is inscribed with Chinese characters representing the name Pearl Sydenstricker. { Conn, Peter, Dragon and the Pearl } [ Humanitarian efforts ] Buck was highly committed to a range of issues that were largely ignored by her generation. Many of her life experiences and political views are described in her novels, short stories, fiction, child ren &apos;s stories, and the biographies of her parents entitled Fighting Angel (on Absalom) and The Exile (on Carrie). She wrote on a diverse variety of topics including women&apos;s rights, Asia n cultures, immigration, adoption, missionary work, and war. In 1949, outraged that existing adoption services considered Asian and mixed-race children unadoptable, Buck established Welcome House, Inc., the first international, interracial adoption agency. In nearly five decades of work, Welcome House has placed over five thousand children. In 1964, to support children who were not eligible for adoption, Buck established the Pearl S. Buck Foundation to &quot; address poverty and discrimination faced by children in Asian countries. &quot; In 1965, she opened the Opportunity Center and Orphanage in South Korea, and later offices were opened in Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. When establishing Opportunity House, Buck said, &quot; The purpose... is to publicize and eliminate injustices and prejudices suffered by children, who, because of their birth, are not permitted to enjoy the educational, social, economic and civil privileges normally accorded to children. &quot; { Pearl S. Buck International, &quot; Our History, &quot; 2009. } In the late 1960s, Buck toured West Virginia to raise money to preserve her family farm in Hillsboro, WV. Today The Pearl S. Buck Birthplace is a historic house museum and cultural center. { The Pearl S. Buck Birthplace Foundation, http://www.pearlsbuckbirthplace.com } She hoped the house would &quot; belong to everyone who cares to go there, &quot; and serve as a &quot; gateway to new thoughts and dreams and ways of life. &quot; { Buck, Pearl S. My Mother&apos;s House. Richwood, WV: Appalachian Press. Pp. 30–1. } Long before it was considered fashionable or politically safe to do so, Buck challenged the American public on topics such as racism, sex discrimination and the plight of the thousands of babies born to Asian women left behind and unwanted wherever American soldiers were based in Asia. During her life Buck combined the multiple careers of wife, mother, author, editor and political activist. { Conn, Pearl S. Buck, xv–xvi. } [ Legacy ] Contemporary reviewers were positive, and praised her &quot; beautiful prose, &quot; even though her &quot; style is apt to degenerate into overrepetition and confusion. &quot; [ E.G. Rev. of Sons Pacific Affairs 1933 6 2/3 112–15 13 October 2010 115 ] Peter Conn, in his biography of Buck, argues that despite the accolades awarded to her, Buck&apos;s contribution to literature has been mostly forgotten or deliberately ignored by America&apos;s cultural gatekeepers. { Conn, Pearl S. Buck, xii–xiv. } Kang Liao argues that Buck played a &quot; pioneering role in demythologizing China and the Chinese people in the American mind. &quot; [ Liao Kang Pearl S. Buck: a cultural bridge across the Pacific 1997 Greenwood 978-0-313-30146-9 4 ] Phyllis Bentley, in an overview of Buck&apos;s work published in 1935, was altogether impressed: &quot; But we may say at least that for the interest of her chosen material, the sustained high level of her technical skill, and the frequent universality of her conceptions, Mrs. Buck is entitledto take rank as a considerable artist. To read her novels is to gain not merely knowledge of China but wisdom about life. &quot; [ Bentley Phyllis The Art of Pearl S. Buck The English Journal 1935 24 10 791–800 13 October 2010 800 ] These works aroused considerable popular sympathy for China, and helped foment poor relations with Japan. { William L. O&apos;Neill, A Democracy At War: America&apos;s Fight At Home and Abroad in World War II, p 57 ISBN 0-02-923678-9 } Anchee Min, author of a fictionalized life of Pearl Buck, broke down upon reading Buck&apos;s work, because she had portrayed the Chinese peasants &quot; with such love, affection and humanity &quot;. { NPR, &quot; A Chinese Fan Of Pearl S. Buck Returns The Favor &quot;, All Things Considered, April 7, 2010. Accessed 7/4/10 } Buck was honored in 1983 with a 5¢ Great Americans series postage stamp issued by the United States Postal Service [ National Postal Museum Great Americans series Pearl S.

U.S. President George H.W. Bush toured the Pearl S. Buck House in October 1998. He expressed that he, like millions of other Americans, had gained an appreciation for the Chinese through Buck&apos;s writing.
