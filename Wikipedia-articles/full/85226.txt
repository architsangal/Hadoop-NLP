It was during this time that Lauper began listening to artists such as Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and the Beatles. Her mother encouraged her independence and creativity. At the age of twelve, Lauper learned how to play an acoustic guitar, which her sister had given to her, [ Cyndi Lauper: two decades after blazing the way for a generation of female pop singers, the original day-glo diva is reigniting her career with a collection of songs as colorful as she is.(Interview) McDonnell, Evelyn December 1, 2003 Brant Publications, Inc. ] and she started to write her own lyrics. She had a great love of art and music and tried to find ways to express herself. Even at this early age, Lauper started dyeing her hair different colors and wearing radical fashions. Lauper was accepted in a special public high school for students with talent in the visual arts, but she was held back and eventually dropped out, earning her GED sometime later. At the age of seventeen, she left home, planning to study art. Her journey would take her to Canada, where she spent two weeks in the woods with her dog, Sparkle, trying to find herself. She eventually wound up in Vermont, where she took art classes at Johnson State College. She supported herself by working at various odd jobs. In the mid 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various cover bands (such as Doc West and Flyer, who still perform under the names Gap Wilson Band and Red, White and Blues Band), in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands such as Jefferson Airplane, Led Zeppelin, and Bad Company. Even though Lauper was now performing on stage, she was not happy singing cover songs. In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off. She was told by three doctors that she would never sing again. Vocal coach Katie Agresta helped Lauper regain her voice by teaching her proper vocal exercises.

Turi and Lauper became writing partners and formed a band called Blue Angel. They decided to put everything they had into making an album of original material. A few demos were recorded and the tape found its way over to Steve Massarsky, who was managing The Allman Brothers Band. Massarsky said the tape was horrible, but he was attracted to Lauper&apos;s voice. He saw them play live and eventually started managing the band after buying their contract out for $5,000. Many people wanted to sign Lauper only if she would sign on as a solo artist. Lauper held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Polydor Records eventually signed them as a band. In 1980, they released a self-titled album on Polydor Records. Rolling Stone magazine later included it as one of the 100 best new wave album covers (2003). Lauper hated the cover, often saying they made her look like Big Bird. Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (or &quot; went lead &quot;, as Lauper says) and the band broke up. Polydor Records had a regime change, and the label would not let the band back into the studio unless they had a hit. The members of Blue Angel had a falling out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an $80,000 suit against them. This suit forced Lauper into bankruptcy.

With help from Rick Chertoff, Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman (of The Hooters ) as her primary studio musicians, She&apos;s So Unusual&apos;s popularity spread like wildfire.

She altered a lot of the songs that were thrown her way, often changing the lyrics to suit her. An example is her Platinum-certified &quot; Girls Just Want to Have Fun &quot;; Lauper says the original lyrics of the song dealt more with a girl pleasing a man, and therefore she changed the lyrics, wanting the song to be more of an anthem as she felt the original song seemed misogynistic.

Lauper co-wrote &quot; Time After Time &quot; with Rob Hyman when her producer, Rick Chertoff, suggested to the band that the album could use one more song. The record label did not have much faith in Lauper as a songwriter, but they gave her the chance to prove herself. &quot; Time After Time &quot; hit #1 on both Billboard&apos;s Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts. It earned Lauper Gold certification with sales of 500,000 from the RIAA and was one of the biggest hits of 1984. It has been covered by more than 100 artists.

In some countries, &quot; When You Were Mine &quot;, a cover of a Prince song found on his 1980 album &quot; Dirty Mind &quot;, was released as a promotional single in 1985. Lauper spent 1984 touring and promoting She&apos;s So Unusual. By the end of the year, she was the first female to have four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 Top Five hits from one album. The LP itself stayed in the Top 200 charts for more than 65 weeks and has since sold 16 million copies worldwide. In 1985, The Women in Crystal Film Awards awarded her with the New Directions Award, given to those who are known for their creativity and originality.

The video ran constantly on MTV and featured the late professional wrestling manager &quot; Captain &quot; Lou Albano as Lauper&apos;s father, and her real-life mother, Catrine, as her mother. Also in the video are her attorney, her manager and her brother, Butch. It won the first-ever award for Best Female Video at the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards. All three of Lauper&apos;s first videos were directed by Edd Griles, &quot; Girls Just Want to Have Fun &quot;, &quot; Time After Time &quot; and &quot; She Bop &quot;. The videos featured many of Lauper&apos;s family members and her dog, Sparkle. Lauper was on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in May 1984. The photo on the cover had been reversed to make room for the title. She also appeared on the cover of Time and Newsweek with the headline &quot; Women In Rock &quot;. Lauper was voted by Ms. magazine one of its women of the year. During this time period, Lauper appeared on the cover of People magazine twice. The video for &quot; Money Changes Everything &quot; was shot during a concert at the Summit in Houston, Texas. The concert was broadcast over the radio and HBO, and fans were told to show up wearing white T-shirts. The video featured a 14 year old fan named Jennifer Payson hugging Lauper onstage. She started 1985 by participating on USA for Africa &apos;s famine-relief fund-raising single &quot; We Are the World &quot;, singing the climactic soprano part of the bridge. During the taping of the song, the audio engineers were having problems discovering what was causing a clicking noise in the recording. It was discovered to be coming from Lauper&apos;s jewelry. At the event, she appeared with WWF Superstar Hulk Hogan, who played her &quot; bodyguard. &quot; Lauper, in return, made many appearances as herself in a number of the World Wrestling Federation &apos;s &quot; Rock &apos;n&apos; Wrestling Connection &quot; events, including the inaugural WrestleMania event, where she was the manager of Wendi Richter.

Lauper had the power to choose whom she wanted on the soundtrack, so she tried to make the album very diverse. The Bangles were just one of the bands that contributed to the soundtrack. Lauper stated in a 1986 interview that she had been working 12 hour days and had gynecological problems. Lauper had a minor operation and spent some time in the hospital.

The video was split up into two acts, making Lauper the very first artist to have a two-part video. Spielberg even allowed her access to the set pieces from the film. The soundtrack album reached #73 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The song reached #10 on Billboards Hot 100 chart in 1985. Lauper has been quoted as saying that she had long despised the song because of Richard Donner &apos;s insistence on everything being perfect for the video shoot. In behind-the-scenes footage of the video, you can see Lauper physically exhausted from the work on the video. The video was released in two parts. The first part premiered on MTV before The Goonies was released in theaters, and the second part came after the movie had opened. [ December 2009 ] While the song and the movie have become 1980s cult classics, working on the soundtrack postponed Lauper&apos;s second album. Lauper stopped performing &quot; The Goonies &apos;R&apos; Good Enough &quot;, in concert around 1987. During the Australian leg of her 2004 &quot; At Last &quot; tour, at the request of the crowd she performed an a cappella version of the first verse and chorus at several shows. It was at a show in Baltimore on Lauper&apos;s 2006 tour that she finally played it in full again. The crowd was chanting &quot; Goonies &quot; and she sang the song a cappella to an ecstatic crowd. She finally agreed to play the song again on her &quot; True Colors &quot; tour in 2007, and it was featured in her 2008 tour of Australia as the second number performed at each show. During the video commentary for &quot; The Goonies &quot;, actor Sean Astin can be heard thanking Lauper for the song. He says that they all appeared tired on the set of the video because of the rigorous shooting schedule, but they really did love the song. Astin apologizes to Lauper again in footage that can be seen in the upcoming &quot; Goonies Documentary &quot;. [ December 2009 ] [ 1986–1988: True Colors ] Lauper performing in 2000.
