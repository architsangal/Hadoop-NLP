[ the biographer Patrick McGilligan (biographer) ] Patrick McGilligan (12 April 1889 – 15 November 1979) was an Irish lawyer and Cumann na nGaedheal and Fine Gael politician. McGilligan was born in Coleraine, County Londonderry, Ireland. He was educated at St Columb&apos;s College, Derry; Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare and University College Dublin. [ Lawyer and politician ] He joined Sinn Féin but was unsuccessful in his attempt to be elected as a MP at the 1918 general election. McGilligan was called to the bar in 1921.

In 1927 he set up the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), and also the Agricultural Credit Corporation. [ External Affairs ] { Irish Free State passport (issued 1930). &apos;&apos; &quot; We, Patrick McGilligan, Esquire, Minister for External Affairs of the Irish Free State, Request and require, in the name of His Majesty George V. King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely etc. &quot; &apos;&apos; } Also in 1927 McGilligan also took over the External Affairs portfolio following the assassination of Kevin O&apos;Higgins by the anti- Treaty elements of the IRA, in revenge for O&apos;Higgins&apos; support for the execution of Republican prisoners during the Irish Civil War (1922–23). In this position he was hugely influential at the Committee on the Operation of Dominion Legislation and at the Imperial Conference in 1930 (jointly with representatives of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom ). The Statute of Westminster that emerged from these meetings gave greater power to dominion s in the Commonwealth like the Irish Free State. [ In opposition ] During his period in opposition from 1932 to 1948 he built up a law practice and became professor of constitutional and international law at University College, Dublin, and when the National University of Ireland representation was transferred to the Seanad in 1937, McGilligan was elected as TD for the Dublin North–West constituency. [ Minister for Finance ] In 1948 McGilligan was appointed Minister for Finance in the first Inter-Party Government. As Minister he undertook some major reforms. He instigated a new approach where Government invested radically in capital projects. [ May 2011 ] Colleagues however complained of his frequent absence from the Cabinet table and the difficulty of contacting him at the Department of Finance Between 1954 and 1957 he served as Attorney General, a job in which as he admitted he felt far more at home than as Minister for Finance. He retired from Dáil Éireann at the 1965 general election, having served for over 40 years. Patrick McGilligan died in Dublin on 15 November 1979. A later Attorney General John M. Kelly in the preface to The Irish Constitution (1980) noted the remarkable number of senior judges who were former students of McGilligan and suggested that given his own firm belief in the value of judicial review he deserves much of the credit for the remarkable development of Irish law in this field since the early 1960s.
