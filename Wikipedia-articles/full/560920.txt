Victoria Ka iulani Kalaninuiahilapalapa Kawekiu i Lunalilo Cleghorn (1875–1899) was heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawai i and held the title of crown princess. Ka iulani became known throughout the world for her intelligence, beauty and determination. After the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, she visited the United States to help restore the Kingdom. Although reluctant to participate in politics, she made many speeches and public appearances denouncing the overthrow of her government and the injustice toward her people. In Washington, D.C, she paid an informal visit to U.S. President Grover Cleveland and his wife, but her efforts could not prevent eventual annexation. [ Heiress to the throne ] Ka iulani as a little girl. Victoria Ka iulani was born October 16, 1875 in Honolulu. Through her mother Ka iulani was descended from High Chief Kepo okalani, the first cousin of Kamehameha the Great on the side of Kamehameha&apos;s mother, Keku iapoiwa II. Her mother was also sister of King Kalākaua and Queen Lili uokalani. Ka iulani&apos;s father was Archibald Scott Cleghorn, a Scottish financier from Edinburgh and the last Royal Governor of O ahu. She was baptized Christmas Day, 1875 at St. Andrew&apos;s Pro Cathedral. [ Hawaiian Kingdom 1874-1893, the Kalakaua Dynastism Ralph S. Kuykendall 1967 978-0-87022-433-1 University of Hawaii Press 477 ] Princess Ruth Ke elikōlani stood as her godmother.Ka iulani was named after her aunt Anna Ka iulani who died young, and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, whose help restored the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawai i during the reign of Kamehameha III. The name comes from ka iu lani which means &quot; the highest point of heaven &quot; or &quot; the royal sacred one &quot; in the Hawaiian language. [ ʻiu D5558 ] Upon her birth, Ka iulani was gifted the estate of Ainahau in Waikiki by her godmother. Ka iulani inherited Ainahau at the age of 11 upon the death of her mother. In 1881, King Kalākaua tried to arrange a marriage between Ka iulani and Japan&apos;s Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito in hopes of creating an alliance between Japan and the Kingdom of Hawai i. However, the prince declined, as he was already pre-arranged to marry a Japanese noble lady, Arima Yoriko. In 1894, Queen Lili uokalani wrote to her niece to marry one of the three: Prince David Kawānanakoa, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, or Prince Komatsu Akihito (then studying in London), the half-brother of Higashifushimi Yorihito. She replied to her aunt that she would prefer to marry for love unless it was necessary to protect the independence of the Hawaiian Kingdom. On February 3, 1898, she declared her engagement to Prince David Kawānanakoa, but her early death ended the hope of marriage.

Stevenson called her &quot; the island rose &quot; in a poem he wrote in her autograph book.

Her few surviving paintings demonstrate considerable talent. [ Don R. Severson Finding Paradise, Island Art in Private Collections University of Hawaii Press 2002 85–87 ] Because Princess Ka iulani was second in line to the throne after her elderly and childless aunt, it was predicted that the young girl would eventually become Queen. King Kalākaua, Queen Kapi olani, Cleghorn, and the Princess talked about the issue and it was determined that it would be in the young Princess&apos;s best interests that she be given a British education. In 1889, at the age of 13, Ka iulani was sent to Northamptonshire, England to be given a private education at Great Harrowden Hall. She excelled in her studies of Latin, Literature, Mathematics, and History there. She also took classes in French, German, and sports (mostly tennis and cricket). In 1892, Ka iulani made a new start by moving to Brighton where she was chaperoned and tutored by Mrs. Rooke who set up a curriculum including German, French and English. This village by the sea was very pleasing to the young princess and her enthusiasm was renewed. { iulani Project USA } &lt; /blockquote &gt; She continued to study in England for the next four years, despite the fact that she had originally been told that she would only be studying in Britain for one year. Her overseers from Hawai i had planned for her to take a trip around Europe and had even arranged for her to have an audience with Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, but following the overthrow of her Aunt, Queen Lili uokalani, on January 17, 1893 by local businessmen, all plans were cancelled and she went to New York. [ The overthrow ] [ overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii ] During her absence, much turmoil occurred back in Hawai i. King Kalakaua died in 1891 and Princess Lydia Lili uokalani became Queen. Lili uokalani immediately appointed Ka iulani as her heir, and Ka iulani became the Crown Princess. In 1893, the Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown and the new government attempted to become a part of the United States. The news arrived to Ka iulani on January 30, 1893 in a short telegram that said: &quot; &apos;Queen Deposed&apos;, &apos;Monarchy Abrogated&apos;, &apos;Break News to Princess&apos; &quot;. Ka iulani then made a statement to the press in England: { &quot; Four years ago, at the request of Mr. Thurston, then a Hawaiian Cabinet Minister, I was sent away to England to be educated privately and fitted to the position which by the constitution of Hawaii I was to inherit. For all these years, I have patiently and in exile striven to fit myself for my return this year to my native country. I am now told that Mr. Thurston will be in Washington asking you to take away my flag and my throne. No one tells me even this officially. Have I done anything wrong that this wrong should be done to me and my people? I am coming to Washington to plead for my throne, my nation and my flag. Will not the great American people hear me? &quot; } [ 10524/450 ] She referred to Lorrin A. Thurston, who was touring the United States promoting its annexation of Hawaii.

Kuykendall 1967 978-0-87022-433-1 University of Hawaii Press 115 http://books.google.com/books?id%3D41gjgT5C0K8C ] Ka iulani decided to take action and traveled to the United States herself the following month. Upon arrival on American shores, although shy by nature, she addressed the press in public with these words: { &quot; Seventy years ago, Christian America sent over Christian men and women to give religion and civilization to Hawai i. Today, three of the sons of those missionaries are at your capitol asking you to undo their father’s work. Who sent them? Who gave them the authority to break the Constitution which they swore they would uphold? Today, I, a poor weak girl with not one of my people with me and all these ‘Hawaiian’ statesmen against me, have strength to stand up for the rights of my people. Even now I can hear their wail in my heart and it gives me strength and courage and I am strong - strong in the faith of God, strong in the knowledge that I am right, strong in the strength of seventy million people who in this free land will hear my cry and will refuse to let their flag cover dishonor to mine! &quot; } [ http://www.electricscotland.com/history/women/wh36.htm Princess Kaiulani Women in history of Scots descent web site Electric Scotland USA ] The Princess suffered eye problems, and developed migraines following the overthrow of the Monarchy. The pro-annexation press of the time often treated Ka iulani with contempt,referring to her in print as a half-breed, or calling her &quot; dusky &quot;, although she did not receive the blatantly racist treatment repeatedly given her Aunt. (Typical of the time, &quot; positive &quot; accounts of the Princess appearance often tried to emphasize what was thought to be &quot; white &quot; about her, although her &quot; British &quot; half was invoked negatively on occasion by American writers fearing Great Britain was a rival for possession of Hawai i.) As she traveled across the United States following her education, the real Princess surprised open-minded members of the press. Instead of an unmannered caricature &quot; heathen &quot; described by enemies of the Kingdom of Hawai i, journalists and the public were confronted by a modern Royal Princess wearing elegant gowns and speaking English (or Hawaiian, French or German). She traveled through New York City and Boston where she attended various social events, many in her honor. She then went to Washington DC where she met with President Grover Cleveland and his wife at the White House. She made a good impression and Cleveland expressed concern for Hawai i&apos;s plight. Ka iulani felt encouraged something would be done and returned to England. However, when Cleveland brought Ka iulani&apos;s case to Congress, while the United States Senate did not proceed with annexation, it refused to restore the monarchy. The situation in Hawai i did not improve, and Ka iulani was deeply disappointed. Over the next few years, Ka iulani remained in Europe. There, she received news in 1894 that her childhood friend, author Robert Louis Stevenson, [ Arthur Johnstone Recollections of Robert Louis Stevenson in the Pacific http://books.google.com/books?id%3DfpI7sSgVWMYC 1905 Chatto &amp; Windus ] had died and that a new Republic of Hawai i had been established. Her health slowly deteriorated. Ka iulani&apos;s health worsened when she learned that her half-sister, Annie Cleghorn, had died in 1897 and her guardian from England, Theophilus Harris Davies, had also died. The Princess suffered eye problems, and developed migraines following the overthrow of the Monarchy (although one such headache kept her from participating in a charity event in Paris, where a devastating fire killed scores of society women). Numerous documented symptoms may indicate she suffered from thyroid disease, which would help explain her early death. [ Later years ] Ka iulani returned to Hawai i in 1897. The return to a warmer climate did not help her health. She continued to deteriorate as she struggled to readjust to the tropical climate of the Hawaiian islands. However, she continued to make public appearances at the urging of her father. With the approval of Queen Lili uokalani and Queen Dowager Kapi olani and in compliance with the last Hawaiian constitution, Princess Ka iulani and Prince Kawānanakoa announced their engagement on February 3, 1898.

She was now a private citizen of the Republic of Hawaii, and on August 12, 1898 became citizen of the Territory of Hawaii as the annexation finally took place. During the Annexation ceremony, the Princess and her aunt, Lili uokalani, along with other members of the royal family and with the heads of every Hawaiian political party, wore funeral attire and shuttered themselves within Washington Place, protesting what they considered an illegal transaction. &quot; When the news of Annexation came it was bitterer than death to me, &quot; Princess Ka iulani, told the San Francisco Chronicle. &quot; It was bad enough to lose the throne, but infinitely worse to have the flag go down... &quot; [ Hawaii&apos;s Own: A look at a century of annexation Michael Tighe Associated Press August 9, 1998 http://www.hawaii-nation.org/hawaiis-own1.html 2010-03-30 ] Ka iulani loved peacocks.

Earlier she had caught cold from swimming while on the Big Island, and this worsened matters. Ka iulani was brought back to O ahu where her health continued to decline. She died on March 6, 1899 at the age of 23 of inflammatory rheumatism. She was interred in Honolulu&apos;s Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii. Her father also said that he thought that since Hawaiʻi was gone, it was fitting for Kaʻiulani to go as well.
