[ February 2011 ] [ History ] Warm Springs first came to prominence in the 19th century as a spa town, due to its mineral spring s which flow constantly at nearly 32 °C (90 °F). It is famous for the Little White House, where Franklin Delano Roosevelt lived while president, because of his paralytic illness. He died there, in his room in the Little White House, which is now a public museum. Roosevelt first came in the 1920s in hopes that the warm water would improve his paraplegia, at the time thought to be due to polio. He was a constant visitor for two decades and died there in 1945. The town is still home to the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation (Roosevelt&apos;s former polio hospital) which remains a world-renowned comprehensive rehabilitation center including a physical rehabilitation hospital and vocational rehabilitation unit.
