These horns can weigh up to [ 30 lb ], while the sheep themselves weigh up to [ 300 lb ]. [ http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Ovis_canadensis.html Ultimate Ungulate page Bighorn Sheep ] Recent genetic testing indicates that there are three distinct subspecies of Ovis canadensis, one of which is endangered: Ovis canadensis sierrae. Sheep originally crossed to North America over the Bering land bridge from Siberia: the population in North America peaked in the millions, and the bighorn sheep entered into the mythology of Native American s. However, by 1900 the population had crashed to several thousand. Conservation efforts (in part by the Boy Scout s ) have restored the population. [ Taxonomy and genetics ] { Anza-Borrego State Park } Ovis canadensis is one of three species of mountain sheep in North America and Siberia; the other two species being Ovis dalli, which includes Dall Sheep and Stone&apos;s Sheep, and the Siberian snow sheep Ovis nivicola. Wild sheep crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia during the Pleistocene (~750,000 years ago) and subsequently spread through western North America as far south as Baja California and northwestern mainland Mexico. Divergence from their closest Asian ancestor (snow sheep) occurred about 600,000 years ago. In North America, wild sheep have diverged into two extant species—Dall sheep, which occupy Alaska and northwestern Canada, and bighorn sheep, which range from southern Canada to Mexico. [ United States Fish and Wildlife Service http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plans/2003/030730.pdf Draft recovery plan for the Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep ] However, the status of these species is questionable given that hybridization has occurred between them in their recent evolutionary history.

[ Description ] A juvenile Bighorn sheep are named for the large, curved horn s borne by the rams (males). Ewes (females) also have horns, but they are shorter with less curvature. [ http://www.bighorninstitute.org/faq.htm Facts about bighorn sheep Bighorn Institute 2010-10-12 ] They range in color from light brown to grayish or dark, chocolate brown, with a white rump and lining on the back of all four legs.

[ http://www.enature.com/flashcard/show_flash_card.asp?recordNumber%3DMA0042 Bighorn Sheep eNature Nature Guides ] Male bighorn sheep have large horn cores, enlarged cornual and frontal sinuses and internal bony septa. These adaptations serve to protect the brain by absorbing the impact of clashes. [ Geist V. 1971 Mountain sheep: a study in behavior and evolution Univ. Chicago Press Chicago, IL ] Bighorn sheep have preorbital gland s on the anterior corner of each eye, inguinal glands in the groin and pedal glands on each foot. Secretions from these glands may support dominance behaviors. Bighorns from the Rocky Mountains are relatively large, with males that occasionally exceed [ 500 lb kg -1 on ] and females that exceed [ 200 lb kg -1 on ]. In contrast, Sierra Nevada Bighorn males weigh up to only [ 200 lb kg -1 on ] and females to [ 140 lb kg -1 on ]. Males&apos; horns can weigh up to [ 30 lb kg 0 on ], as much as the rest of the bones in the male&apos;s body.

In contrast, the desert bighorn sheep subspecies are indigenous to the hot desert ecosystem s of the Southwestern United States. Bighorn sheep generally inhabit alpine meadows, grassy mountain slopes and foothill country near rugged, rocky cliffs and bluffs. Since bighorn sheep cannot move though deep snow, they prefer drier slopes where the annual snowfall is less than about sixty inches a year. A bighorn&apos;s winter range usually lies 2,500-5,000 feet in elevation, while its summer range is tends to be 6,000-8,500 feet. [ Festa-Bianchet M. 1999 Bighorn sheep 348–350 D.E. Wilson S. Ruff The Smithsonian Book of North American Mammals Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian Institution Press ] Bighorn sheep are highly susceptible to certain diseases carried by domestic sheep such as scabies and pneumonia; additional mortality occurs as a result of accidents involving rock fall or falling off cliffs (a hazard of living in steep, rugged terrain). Bighorns are well adapted to climbing steep terrain where they seek cover from predator s. Predation primarily occurs with lambs which are hunted by coyote s, bobcat s, lynxes and golden eagle s. Bighorn sheep of all ages are threatened by bear s, wolves and especially cougar s, which are perhaps best equipped with the agility to predate in uneven, rocky habitats. [ http://eduscapes.com/nature/bighorn/index1.htm Bighorn Sheep Eduscapes.com 2011 2011-07-21 ] They are considered good indicators of land health because the species is sensitive to many human -induced environmental problems. In addition to their aesthetic value, bighorn sheep are considered desirable game animal s by hunters. Bighorn sheep graze on grass es and browse shrub s, particularly in fall and winter, and seek mineral s at natural salt lick s. [ http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bighorn.htm Description of Bighorn Sheep at Yellowstone Park ] Females tend to forage and walk, possibly to avoid predators and protect lambs, while males tend to eat and then rest and ruminate which lends to more effective digestion and greater increase in body size. [ Ruckstuhl K. E. 1998 Foraging behaviour and sexual segregation in bighorn sheep Animal Behaviour 56 96–106 ] [ Social structure and reproduction ] A bighorn ram following a juvenile ewe. Bighorn sheep live in large flocks, and do not typically follow a single leader ram, unlike the mouflon, the ancestor of the domestic sheep, which has a strict dominance hierarchy. Prior to the mating season or &quot; rut &quot;, the rams attempt to establish a dominance hierarchy that determines access to ewes for mating. It is during the prerut period that most of the characteristic horn clashing occurs between rams, although this behavior may occur to a limited extent throughout the year. [ Valdez R. P. R. Krausman 1999 Mountain Sheep of North America The University of Arizona Press, Tucson 0-8165-1839-4 ] Ram&apos;s horns can frequently exhibit damage from repeated clashes. Females exhibit a stable, non-linear hierarchy that correlates with age. [ 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1991.tb03832.x Hass C. C. 1991 Social status in female bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis): expression, development, and reproductive correlates Journal of Zoology London 225 3 509–523 ] Females may fight for high social status when they are integrated into the hierarchy at 1–2 years of age. Rocky Mountain bighorn rams employ at least three different courting strategies. [ 10.1126/science.6539948 Hogg J. T. 1984 Mating in Bighorn Sheep: Multiple Creative Male Stategies Science 225 4661 526–529 6539948 ] The most common and successful is the tending strategy in which a ram follows and defends an estrous ewe. Tending takes a lot of strength and dominance and thus ewes are more receptive to tending males, feeling that they are the most fit. Another tactic is coursing which is when a rams fights for an already tended ewe. Ewes tend to avoid coursing males so the strategy is not effective. Rams will also employ a blocking strategy. They will prevent a ewe from accessing tending areas before she even goes into estrous. Bighorn ewes have a six-month gestation. In temperate climates, the peak of the rut occurs in November with one, or rarely two, lambs being born in May. Most births occur in the first two weeks of the lambing period. Pregnant ewes of the Rocky Mountains migrate to alpine areas in spring, presumably to give birth in areas safer from predation but are away from areas with good quality forage. [ 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1998.tb00043.x Ruckstuhl K. E. M. Festa-Bianchet 1998 Do reproductive status and lamb gender affect the foraging behavior of bighorn ewes? Ethology 104 941–954 11 ] Lambs born earlier in the season are more likely to survive than lambs born later. [ 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1988.tb03764.x Marco Festa-Bianchet 1988 Birthdate and survival in bighorn lambs (Ovis canadensis) Journal of Zoology 214 4 653–661 ] Lambs that are born late may not have access to sufficient milk as their mothers are lacatating at a time when food quality is lower. Newborn lambs weigh from [ 8 to 10 lb kg ] and can walk within hours. The lambs are then weaned when they reach 4–6 months. The lifespan of rams is typically 9–12 years, with 10–14 years for ewes. [ Relationship with humans ] Two hundred years ago, bighorn sheep were widespread throughout the western US, Canada and northern Mexico. Some estimates placed their population at over 2 million. By around 1900, hunting, competition from domesticated sheep, and diseases had decreased the population to several thousand. A program of reintroductions, natural parks, and reduced hunting, together with a decrease in domesticated sheep near the end of World War II, allowed the bighorn sheep to make a comeback. In 2009, the California Department of Fish and Game issued 21 permits for the hunting of bighorn sheep, and 19 permits for the 2010-11 hunting season. { California DFG 2010 - 2011 Bighorn Sheep Tag Quotas and Season Dates. Dfg.ca.gov. Retrieved on 2011-09-16. } { Grand Canyon } [ Boy Scouts ] In 1936, the Arizona Boy Scout s mounted a state-wide campaign to save the bighorn sheep. The Scouts first became interested in the sheep through the efforts of Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the noted conservationist who has been called the Father of Scouting. [ van Wyk Peter 2000 http://www.burnhamkingofscouts.com/ Burnham: King of Scouts Trafford Publishing 1-4122-0028-8 2007-03-30 ] Burnham observed that fewer than 150 of these sheep still lived in the Arizona mountains. He called George F. Miller, then scout executive of the boy scout council headquartered in Phoenix, with a plan to save the sheep. Burnham put it this way: I want you to save this majestic animal, not only because it is in danger of extinction, but of more importance, some day it might provide domestic sheep with a strain to save them from disaster at the hands of a yet unknown virus. Several other prominent Arizonans join the movement and a save the bighorns poster contest was started in schools throughout the state. Burnham provided prizes and appeared in store windows across Arizona. The contest-winning bighorn emblem was made into neckerchief slides for the 10,000 boy scouts, and talks and dramatizations were given at school assemblies and on radio. The National Wildlife Federation, the Izaak Walton League, and the National Audubon Society also joined the effort. These efforts led to the establishment of two Bighorn game ranges in Arizona: Kofa National Wildlife Refuge and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. On January 18, 1939, over [ 1500000 acre km2 ] were set aside and a civilian conservation corps side camp was set up to develop high mountain waterholes for the sheep. The desert bighorn sheep is now the official mascot for the Arizona Boy Scouts. [ Edward H. Saxton March 1978 Saving the Desert Bighorns Desert Magazine 41 3 http://www.scribd.com/doc/2404512/197803-Desert-Magazine-1978-March 2008-04-27 ] [ In culture ] { Bishop, California } Bighorn sheep were among the most-admired animals of the Apsaalooka, or Crow, people, and what is today called the Bighorn Mountain Range was central to the Apsaalooka tribal lands. In the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area book, storyteller Old Coyote describes a legend related to the bighorn sheep. A man possessed by evil spirits attempts to kill his heir by pushing the young man over a cliff, but the victim is saved by getting caught in trees. Rescued by bighorn sheep, the man takes the name of their leader, Big Metal. The other sheep grant him power, wisdom, sharp eyes, sure footedness, keen ears, great strength, and a strong heart. Big Metal returns to his people with the message that the Apsaalooka people will survive only so long as the river winding out of the mountains is known as the Bighorn River.

They also serve as a source of eco-tourism, as tourists come to see the bighorn sheep in their native habitat.
