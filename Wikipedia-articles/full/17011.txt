They are also absent from the Black and Baltic Seas. } { Orcinus orcarange (in blue) } The killer whale (Orcinus orca), commonly referred to as the orca whale or orca, and less commonly as the blackfish, is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family. Killer whales are found in all oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas. Killer whales as a species have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammal s such as sea lion s, seals, walrus es and even large whale s. Killer whales are regarded as apex predator s, lacking natural predators. Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups which are the most stable of any animal species. [ Ford Ellis Balcomb 2000 12 ] Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of culture. The IUCN currently assesses the orca&apos;s conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs ), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with fisheries. In late 2005, the &quot; southern resident &quot; population of killer whales that inhabits British Columbia and Washington state waters were placed on the U.S. Endangered Species list. Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans, [ Carwardine 2001 19 ] although there have been cases of captives killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers. [ Taxonomy and evolution ] { Orcinus citoniensis &apos;&apos; fossil, an extinct species of the same genus, Museo Capellini di Bologna } Orcinus orca is the only recognized extant species in the genus Orcinus, one of many animal species originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in Systema Naturae. [ Linnaeus C. Carl Linnaeus Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I 10th Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii) 1758 824 http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#3 ] Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of a killer whale in his &quot; Fish book &quot; of 1558, based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest. { Zum Wal in der Marienkirche (in German). St. Mary&apos;s Church, Greifswald. Retrieved 2010-02-16 } The killer whale is one of 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale and the pilot whale s, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella.

Killer whale advocates point out that it has a long heritage. Indeed, the genus name Orcinus means &quot; of the kingdom of the dead &quot;, or &quot; belonging to Orcus. &quot; { Killer Whales. Scientific Classification, Seaworld.org, 23 September 2010, Retrieved 2010-09-09. } Ancient Romans originally applied orca (plural orcae) to these animals, possibly borrowing it from the Greek [ grc ὄρυξ ], which referred (among other things) to a whale species. Since the 1960s, orca has steadily grown in popularity; both names are now used. The term orca is preferred by some to avoid the negative connotations of &quot; killer &quot;, { Olsen, Ken. Orcas on the Edge – Killer: It&apos;s a Name, Not an Accusation. National Wildlife Federation. 10 January 2006.

Grampus is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of grampus should not be confused with the Grampus genus, whose only member is Risso&apos;s Dolphin. { Leatherwood, Stephen and Larry J. Hobbs (1988).

Residents&apos; diet consists primarily of fish and sometimes squid, and they live in complex and cohesive family groups called pods. Female residents characteristically have a rounded dorsal fin tip that terminates in a sharp corner. They visit the same areas consistently. British Columbia and Washington resident populations are amongst the most-intensively studied marine mammals. Researchers have identified and named over 300 killer whales over the past 30 years. Transient: The diet of these whales consists almost exclusively of marine mammals; they do not eat fish. Transients generally travel in small groups, usually of two to six animals, and have less persistent family bonds than residents. Transients vocalize in less variable and less complex dialects. Female transients are characterized by more triangular and pointed dorsal fins than those of residents. The gray or white area around the dorsal fin, known as the &quot; saddle patch &quot;, often contains some black colouring in residents. However, the saddle patches of transients are solid and uniformly gray. Transients roam widely along the coast; some individuals have been sighted in both southern Alaska and California. Offshore: A third population of killer whales in the northeast Pacific was discovered in 1988, when a humpback whale researcher observed them in open water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily on schooling fish. However, because of the large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting transients, they may also eat mammals and sharks. They have mostly been encountered off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near the Queen Charlotte Islands. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200. Currently, little is known about their habits, but they are genetically distinct from residents and transients. Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin tips that are continuously rounded. { Ross Sea. The eye patch slants forward. } { alt=Killer whale mother and calf extending their bodies above the water surface, from pectoral fins forward, with ice-pack in background } Transients and residents live in the same areas, but avoid each other. [ NMFS 2005 23 ] The name &quot; transient &quot; originated from the belief that these killer whales were outcasts from larger resident pods. Researchers later discovered transients are not born into resident pods or vice-versa. The evolutionary split between the two groups is believed to have begun two million years ago. [ Heimlich Boran 2001 22 ] Genetic data indicates that the types have not interbred for up to 10,000 years. [ Chadwick Douglas H. Investigating A Killer National Geographic April 2005 ] Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish-eating and mammal-eating killer whales have been distinguished elsewhere.

Like Type B, it is primarily white and medium gray, with a dark gray dorsal cape and yellow-tinged patches. Its only observed prey is the Antarctic Cod. Type D was identified based on photographs of a 1955 mass stranding in New Zealand and six at-sea sightings since 2004. Immediately recognizable by its extremely small white eye patch, shorter than usual dorsal fin, and bulbous head (similar to a pilot whale). Its geographic range appears to be circumglobal in subantarctic waters between latitudes 40°S and 60°S. And although nothing is known about the Type D diet, it is suspected to include fish because groups have been photographed around longline vessels where they reportedly depredate Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Types B and C live close to the ice pack, and diatoms in these waters may be responsible for the yellowish coloring of both types.

Its jaws are a powerful gripping apparatus, as the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.

Gestation varies from 15 to 18 months. Mothers calve, with usually a single offspring, about once every 5 years. In resident pods, birth occurs at any time of year, although winter is the most popular. Mortality is extremely high during the first six to seven months of life, when 37–50% of all calves die.

[ Carwardine 2001 21 ] Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of killer whales ( &gt; 0.40 individuals per 100 km²) in the northeast Atlantic around the Norwegian coast, in the north Pacific along the Aleutian Islands, the Gulf of Alaska and in the Southern Ocean off much of the coast of Antarctica. They are considered &quot; common &quot; (0.20–0.40 individuals per 100  km²) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, in the North Atlantic Ocean around Iceland and the Faroe Islands. High densities have also been reported but not quantified in the western North Pacific around the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Kuril Islands, Kamchatka and the Commander Islands and in the southern hemisphere off the coasts of South Australia, Patagonia, off the coast of southern Brazil and the tip of southern Africa. They are reported as seasonally common in the Canadian Arctic, including Baffin Bay between Greenland and Nunavut, and around Tasmania and Macquarie Island. Information for offshore regions and tropical waters is more scarce, but widespread, if not frequent, sightings indicate that the killer whale can survive in most water temperatures. There have been sightings, for example, in the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Indian Ocean around the Seychelles. Probably the largest population lives in Antarctic waters, where they range up to the edge of the pack ice and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open leads much like beluga whales in the Arctic. In contrast, killer whales are seasonal summer visitors to Arctic waters, where they do not approach the ice pack. With the rapid Arctic sea ice decline in the Hudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic. { Kwan, Jennifer.

Killer whales generally choose to attack young or weak animals instead. However, a group of five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers.

Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoise s and seals for no apparent reason.

The water surface is disturbed only by relatively small ripples. } Day-to-day killer whale behavior generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales are frequently active at the surface, engaging in acrobatic behaviors such as breaching, spyhopping, and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasite s, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings. [ Carwardine 2001 64 ] Resident killer whales swim with porpoise s, other dolphin s, seals, and sea lion s, which are common prey for transient killer whales. [ Social structure ] Killer whales are notable for their complex societies. Only elephant s and higher primate s, such as humans, live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas&apos; complex social bonds and society, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep these animals in captive situations. [ http://www.keepwhaleswild.org/ Keep Whales Wild Keep Whales Wild 2011-01-14 2011-02-16 ] Resident killer whales in the eastern North Pacific have a particularly complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These societies are based on matriline s consisting of the matriarch and her descendants who form part of the line, as do their descendants. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. [ NMFS 2005 12 ] Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded. Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates that resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. [ NMFS 2005 39 ] { breach, often lifting their entire bodies out of the water. } { alt=A killer whale leaping out of the water is about to land on its back. } Clans are the next level of resident social structure, and are composed of pods with similar dialects and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns. [ In the northeast Pacific, three communities of fish-eating killer whales have been identified: the southern community (1 clan, 3 pods, 90 killer whales as of 2006), the northern community (3 clans, 16 pods, 214 killer whales as of 2000), and the south Alaskan community (2 clans, 11 pods, 211 killer whales as of 2000). Note ] Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become &quot; rovers &quot; and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females. [ NMFS 2005 13 ] As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted. [ NMFS 2005 14 ] [ Vocalizations ] [ Killer whale.ogg Killer whale calls Ogg Killer whale simple.ogg Killer whale calls at a distance Ogg Killer whale residents broadband.ogg Vocalizations of a killer whale Ogg ] Multimedia relating to the orca [ Whale song ] Like all cetaceans, killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. Killer whales produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions. Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters. [ NMFS 2005 20 ] Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. Transients are typically silent probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting. All members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. [ Filatova, Olga A.; Fedutin, Ivan D.; Burdin, Alexandr M. and Hoyt, Erich 2007 http://russianorca.com/Doc/Science/structure_repert.pdf The structure of the discrete call repertoire of killer whales Orcinus orcafrom Southeast Kamchatka Bioacoustics 16 261–280 ] For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf&apos;s birth, which may help the calf learn them.

Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. [ NMFS 2005 15–16 ] Researchers have not determined whether calls have particular meanings or are associated with specific types of activity. Resident dialects contain 7–17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. Transient dialects are much different, having only 4–6 discrete calls, none of which they share with residents. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates that offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects that are unlike those of residents and transients.

They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring &quot; intelligence &quot; is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioral strategies are very different from those of humans. [ Carwardine 2001 67 ] A killer whale plays with a ball of ice, soon after a researcher had thrown a snowball at the whale. Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. This is most strikingly seen when killer whales deliberately beach themselves to catch seals. Off Península Valdés, adults sometimes pull seals off the shoreline and then release them again near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed. [ Baird 2002 61–62 ] People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales&apos; curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. For example, Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but have overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. [ Obee Ellis 1992 42 ] Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal fish as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next: [ &quot; It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn&apos;t even take them an hour to figure it out. They were so thrilled when they figured out what was going on, that we were playing games. They were breaching by the boats. &quot; Craig Matkin ] In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects that the humans are trying to reach, [ 2005 Killer whale games Blackfish Sounder 13 5 http://www.killerwhale.org/BFS/BFS_13.pdf 2007-11-04 ] [ April 2012 ] or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball. { Pitman, Robert L.

Its back is dark from the head to just behind the dorsal fin, where there is a light grey saddle patch. Behind this, and on its lower side, its skin is an intermediate shade. In 2008, the IUCN changed its assessment of the killer whale&apos;s conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spill s, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats. Like other animals at the highest trophic level s, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning from accumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyl s (PCBs). European Harbour seal s have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found that PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals. [ Ford Ellis Balcomb 2000 99 ] Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardant s than in polar bear s. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations. In the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. On the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined. [ Ford Ellis Balcomb 2000 98 ] alt=Two killer whales, one large and one small, swim close together. Their dorsal fins curve backward. In 2005, the United States government listed the southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. The southern resident community comprises three pods which live mostly in the Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. { M. L.

This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in chinook salmon. { Le Phuong. Researchers: 7 Orcas Missing from Puget Sound, Associated Press. USA Today, 25 October 2008 } A scientist by the name of Ken Balcomb has extensively studied killer whales since 1976. Balcomb is the research biologist responsible for discovering that U.S Navy sonar may harm killer whales. He studied killer whales from the Center for Whale Research which is located in Friday Harbor, Washington. [ Pickrell John U.S Navy Sonar May Harm Killer Whales, Expert Says. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0331_040331_whalesincrisis.html 19 March 2012 National Geographic News March 2004 ] He was also able to study killer whales from &quot; his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months. &quot; In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behavior displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed &quot; agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water &quot; to escape the sound of the sonars. &quot; Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said. &quot; The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb&apos;s discovery, research in the Bahamas showed that 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the exact day that U.S Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Out of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied and CAT scans of the two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness. Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when Ottawa decided that it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response, to this decision a total of Six environmental groups sued the federal government in Vancouver, Canada claiming that killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect the killer whales from these threats.

[ &quot; Killer &quot; stereotype ] [ Killer whale attacks on humans ] In Western culture s, killer whales were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators. The first written description of a killer whale was given by Pliny the Elder in circa AD 70, who wrote, &quot; Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other whales]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming. &quot; { Gaius Plinius Secundus. &apos;&apos;Historia Naturalis&apos;&apos; 9.5.12 (Latin), in Bill Thayer&apos;s LacusCurtius: Into the Roman World.

[ Cherry-Garrard Apsley The Worst Journey in the World:Antarctic 1910–1913 Globe Pequot 2004 92 1-59228-212-1 ] There is speculation that the sled dogs&apos; barking may have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale&apos;s hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005 a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. { The Associated Press. &quot; Boy survives bump from killer whale. &quot; The Seattle Times, 18 August 2005.

In the waters of the Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. [ Obee Ellis 1992 Chapter 1 ] As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquaria through 1970 bore bullet scars. [ NMFS 2005 41 ] The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956. { Killer Whales Destroyed: VP-7 Accomplishes Special Task, Naval Aviation News, December, 1956, p. 19.

In the mid 1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident that had been harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time that it was nearly two months before the whale&apos;s keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, non-aggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans. [ Francis Hewlett 2007 58–59 ] { Springer was successfully returned to her family. } { alt=Killer whale wrapped in white cloth on a boat, surrounded by four people. A board braces its dorsal fin. } Between 1964 and 1976, 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in aquaria, and public interest in the animals grew. Millions of people became interested in killer whales after viewing them in captivity. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led to the discovery of the species&apos; complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother-offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades. [ Baird 2002 73–80 ] Bigg&apos;s techniques also revealed that the Pacific Northwest population was small—in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The Southern Resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained. [ Heimlich Boran 2001 11 ] In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades. The public&apos;s growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale–keeping in aquaria. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public&apos;s interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film Free Willy, the movie&apos;s captive star Keiko was returned to the coast of his native Iceland. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters. In 2002, the orphan Springer was discovered in Puget Sound, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behavior and social structure of the region&apos;s killer whales. [ Orphaned orca&apos;s reunion with family celebrated http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/07/13/bc-springer.html 13 July 2007 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 2007-11-06 ] The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young killer whale named Luna who had become separated from his pod could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006 Luna was killed by a boat propeller.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales and Norway took 987. [ Obee Ellis 1992 34 ] Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers, { Killer Whale, Bergen Museum. Retrieved 2010-01-26 } including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts. Killer whales have helped humans hunting other whales. [ Reeves Randall Whitehead Hal Killer whales and whaling: the scavenging hypothesis Biology Letters 1 4 415 2005 17148221 1626385 10.1098/rsbl.2005.0348 ] One well-known example was in Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as they would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers&apos; catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska&apos;s Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.

[ NMFS 2005 43–44 ] From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive–born. Organizations such as the World Society for the Protection of Animals and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. [ Although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas (Corky II and Lolita) are in their mid-40s.

PETA filed a &quot; 20-page complaint asks the U.S. District Court in Southern California to declare that the five whales – Tilikum, Katina, Corky, Kasatka, and Ulises – are being held in slavery or involuntary servitude in violation of the 13th Amendment. &quot; [ Mears, Cohen Bill, Tom PETA Lawsuit Alleges SeaWorld Enslaves Killer Whales http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-26/justice/justice_killer-whale-lawsuit_1_killer-whales-orcinus-sea-world-trainers?_s%3DPM%3AJUSTICE 19 March 2012 CNN 26 October 2011 ] PETA claims that the 13th amendment technically does not state that it solely applies to non-human animals. Ric O&apos;Barry and two former SeaWorld trainers supported PETA in moving forward with this lawsuit. Legal cases in State and federal courts dealing with animal cruelty tend to be based on human actions solely because animals cannot actually be prosecuted or actively participate as plaintiffs and defendants on trial. In 1970 a killer whale, later named Lolita, was captured from the Puget Sound waters and since then has been performing at Miami Seaqurium for more than 40 years. During these four decades celebrities, children, and a Washington state governor have campaigned to free Lolita. [ Vallbona Nuri Whale Activists Sue to Free Lolita from Captivity http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/12/02/9169352-whale-activists-sue-to-free-lolita-from-captivity 19 March 2012 MSNBC US News December 2 2011 ] One of the Lolita supporters is Howard Garret. Howard Garret is a co-founder of the non-profit Orca Network located on Whidbey Island, Wash. Garret believes that Lolita has a strong memory of her life and her family in her former natural habitat. The Miami Seaquarium argues that Lolita&apos;s interaction and dependence on her human caregivers supersedes her natural survival instincts, thus she would not survive on her own in the wild. They also argue that human and boat activity, as well as pollution are serious threats to killer whales. In December of 2011 supporters offered $1 million dollars to have Lolita freed from the Miami Seaquarium. After campaign and financial efforts to free Lolita were denied by the Miami Seaquarium activists are suing the federal government in federal court in Seattle with the argument that Lolita should have been protected when other Southern region orcas were listed as endangered species in 2005. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) deems it illegal to &quot; harass, harm, pursue, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect &quot; to any species put on the list. [ Welch Craig Captive orca could test Endangered Species Act http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2016910986_orcasuit02m.html 19 March 2012 The Seattle Times 01 December 2011 ] The Miami Sequarium did not wish to comment on the lawsuit, instead the Miami Seaquarium released a statement highlighting Lolita&apos;s life in captivity as active, healthy, and well cared for. One plaintiff in the lawsuit named Carter Dillard, chief counsel for the Animal Legal Defense Fund, suggested that Lolita be moved to a larger &quot; sea pen &quot; home where Lolita would be able to swim farther distances and interact with other killer whales.

The fatal event occurred after a show called &quot; Dine with Shamu &quot; at SeaWorld&apos;s Shamu Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The Orange County sheriff&apos;s spokesman Jim Solomons stated that Brancheau slipped and fell into the 35-foot-deep tank, where one of the killer whales fatally injured her.

Lori Miller, who attended the show at SeaWorld prior to the death of the trainer, spoke on &quot; Larry King Live &quot; saying the trainers had a hard time getting the killer whales to perform. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. [ http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id%3D2690153 ABC News: Killer Whale Attacks SeaWorld Trainer ABC News 30 November 2006 2010-01-03 ] A spokesperson for PETA commented on this incident and referred to it as &quot; a tragedy that didn&apos;t have to happen. &quot; Before Brancheau&apos;s death two other trainers were involved in incidents with killer whales at SeaWorld. In 1999, a 27-year-old man sneaked into the park after closing, and his body was later discovered floating on his back in Tillikum&apos;s tank. Another SeaWorld trainer was seriously injured during a show at the Shamu Stadium after being grabbed by a killer whale and held underwater in 2006.
