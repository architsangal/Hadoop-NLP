Although the earliest historical records in the region do not go back much further than ca. 2900 BC, modern historians have asserted that Sumer was first settled between ca. 4500 and 4000 BC by a non- Semitic people who possibly did not speak the Sumerian language (pointing to the names of cities, rivers, basic occupations, etc. as evidence).

However, some, such as Piotr Michalowski and Gerd Steiner, contest the idea of a Proto-Euphratean language or one substrate language. Sumerian civilization took form in the Uruk period (4th millennium BC), continuing into the Jemdat Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. It was conquered by the Semitic -speaking kings of the Akkadian Empire around 2270 BC ( short chronology ). Native Sumerian rule re-emerged for about a century in the third dynasty of Ur ( Sumerian Renaissance ) of the 21st to 20th centuries BC. The cities of Sumer were the first civilization to practice intensive, year-round agriculture, by perhaps c. 5000 BC showing the use of core agricultural techniques, including large-scale intensive cultivation of land, mono-cropping, organized irrigation, and the use of a specialized labour force.The surplus of storable food created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place, instead of migrating after crops and grazing land. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn required an extensive labour force and division of labour.Sumer was also the site of early development of writing, progressing from a stage of proto-writing in the mid 4th millennium BC to writing proper in the third millennium (see Jemdet Nasr period ). [ Origin of name ] The term &quot; Sumerian &quot; is the common name given to the ancient non-Semitic inhabitants of southern Mesopotamia, Sumer, by the Semitic Akkadians. The Sumerians referred to themselves as ùĝ saĝ gíg-ga (cuneiform: [ &amp; #x12326; ] [ &amp; #x12295; ] [ &amp; #x1222A; ] [ &amp; #x120B5; ] ), phonetically uŋ saŋ giga, literally meaning &quot; the black-headed people &quot;. [ W. Hallo, W. Simpson 1971 The Ancient Near East New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich 28 ] The Akkadian word Shumer may represent the geographical name in dialect, but the phonological development leading to the Akkadian term šumerû is uncertain. [ Nimrod before and after the Bible K. van der Toorn, P. W. van der Horst The Harvard Theological Review Jan 1990 83 1 1–29 ] Biblical Shinar, Egyptian Sngr and Hittite Šanhar(a) could be western variants of Shumer. [ City-states ] [ Cities of the Ancient Near East Geography of Mesopotamia ] Map of Sumer By the late 4th millennium BC, Sumer was divided into about a dozen independent city-state s, which were divided by canals and boundary stones. Each was centered on a temple dedicated to the particular patron god or goddess of the city and ruled over by a priestly governor ( ensi ) or by a king ( lugal ) who was intimately tied to the city&apos;s religious rites. The five &quot; first &quot; cities said to have exercised pre-dynastic kingship:       Eridu (Tell Abu Shahrain) Bad-tibira (probably Tell al-Madain) Larsa (Tell as-Senkereh) Sippar (Tell Abu Habbah) Shuruppak (Tell Fara) Other principal cities: &lt; li &gt; Uruk (Warka) &lt; li &gt; Kish (Tell Uheimir &amp; Ingharra) &lt; li &gt; Ur (Tell al-Muqayyar) &lt; li &gt; Nippur (Afak) &lt; li &gt; Lagash (Tell al-Hiba) &lt; li &gt; Girsu (Tello or Telloh) &lt; li &gt; Umma (Tell Jokha) &lt; li &gt; Hamazi 1 &lt; li &gt; Adab (Tell Bismaya) &lt; li &gt; Mari (Tell Hariri) 2 &lt; li &gt; Akshak 1 &lt; li &gt; Akkad 1 &lt; li &gt; Isin (Ishan al-Bahriyat) ( 1 location uncertain) ( 2 an outlying city in northern Mesopotamia) Minor cities (from south to north): Kuara (Tell al-Lahm) Zabala (Tell Ibzeikh) Kisurra (Tell Abu Hatab) Marad (Tell Wannat es-Sadum) Dilbat (Tell ed-Duleim) Borsippa (Birs Nimrud) Kutha (Tell Ibrahim) Der (al-Badra) Eshnunna (Tell Asmar) Nagar (Tell Brak) 2 ( 2 an outlying city in northern Mesopotamia) Apart from Mari, which lies full [ 330 km 0 on ] northwest of Agade, but which is credited in the king list as having “exercised kingship” in the Early Dynastic II period, and Nagar, an outpost, these cities are all in the Euphrates-Tigris alluvial plain, south of Baghdad in what are now the Bābil, Diyala, Wāsit, Dhi Qar, Basra, Al-Muthannā and Al-Qādisiyyah governorates of Iraq. [ History ] [ History of Sumer ] The Sumerian city states rose to power during the prehistorical Ubaid and Uruk periods. Sumerian written history reaches back to the 27th century BC and before, but the historical record remains obscure until the Early Dynastic III period, ca. the 23rd century BC, when a now deciphered syllabary writing system was developed, which has allowed archaeologists to read contemporary records and inscriptions. Classical Sumer ends with the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 23rd century BC. Following the Gutian period, there is a brief &quot; Sumerian renaissance &quot; in the 21st century BC, cut short in the 20th century BC by Semitic Amorite invasions. The Amorite &quot; dynasty of Isin &quot; persisted until ca. 1700 BC, when Mesopotamia was united under Babylonia n rule. The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian ( Assyro-Babylonian ) population.

During this time, the first settlement in southern Mesopotamia was established at Eridu, ca. 5300 BC, by farmers who brought with them the Hadji Muhammed culture, which first pioneered irrigation agriculture. It appears this culture was derived from the Samarra n culture from northern Mesopotamia. It is not known whether or not these were the actual Sumerians who are identified with the later Uruk culture. Eridu remained an important religious center when it was gradually surpassed in size by the nearby city of Uruk. The story of the passing of the &quot; me &quot; (gifts of civilisation) to Innana, Goddess of Uruk and of Love and War, by Enki, God of Wisdom and chief God of Eridu, may reflect this shift in hegemony. { Wolkstein, Dianna and Kramer, Samuel Noah &quot; Innana: Queen of Heaven and Earth &quot;. } It appears that this early culture was an amalgam of three distinct cultural influences: peasant farmers, living in wattle and daub or clay brick houses and practicing irrigation agriculture, hunter-fishermen living in woven reed houses and living on floating islands in the marshes (Proto-Sumerians), and Proto-Akkadian nomadic pastoralists, living in black tents. { Leick, Gwendolyn (2001), &quot; Mespotamia: the Invention of the City &quot; (Allen Lane) } [ Uruk period ] [ Uruk period ] The archaeological transition from the Ubaid period to the Uruk period is marked by a gradual shift from painted pottery domestically produced on a slow wheel to a great variety of unpainted pottery mass-produced by specialists on fast wheels. By the time of the Uruk period (ca. 4100–2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of southern Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 people) where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area—from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as Central Iran. { Algaze, Guillermo (2005) &quot; The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization &quot;, (Second Edition, University of Chicago Press) } The Uruk period civilization, exported by Sumerian traders and colonists (like that found at Tell Brak ), had an effect on all surrounding peoples, who gradually evolved their own comparable, competing economies and cultures. The cities of Sumer could not maintain remote, long-distance colonies by military force. Sumerian cities during the Uruk period were probably theocratic and were most likely headed by a priest-king (ensi), assisted by a council of elders, including both men and women. { Jacobsen, Thorkild (Ed) (1939), &quot; The Sumerian King List &quot; (Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago; Assyriological Studies, No. 11.) } It is quite possible that the later Sumerian pantheon was modeled upon this political structure. There was little evidence of institutionalized violence or professional soldiers during the Uruk period, and towns were generally unwalled. During this period Uruk became the most urbanised city in the world, surpassing for the first time 50,000 inhabitants. The ancient Sumerian king list includes the early dynasties of several prominent cities from this period. The first set of names on the list is of kings said to have reigned before a major flood occurred. These early names may be fictional, and include some legendary and mythological figures, such as Alulim and Dumizid. { Jacobsen, Thorkild (1939) &quot; Sumerian King List &quot; (Univ of Chicago) } The end of the Uruk period coincided with the Piora oscillation, a dry period from c. 3200–2900 BC that marked the end of a long wetter, warmer climate period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, called the Holocene climatic optimum. { Lamb, Hubert H. (1995). Climate, History, and the Modern World. London: Routledge. ISBN 0-415-12735-1 } [ Early Dynastic Period ] The Dynastic period begins ca. 2900 BC and includes such legendary figures as Enmerkar and Gilgamesh —who are supposed to have reigned shortly before the historic record opens ca. 2700 BC, when the now deciphered syllabic writing started to develop from the early pictograms. The center of Sumerian culture remained in southern Mesopotamia, even though rulers soon began expanding into neighboring areas, and neighboring Semitic groups adopted much of Sumerian culture for their own. The earliest Dynastic king on the Sumerian king list whose name is known from any other legendary source is Etana, 13th king of the first Dynasty of Kish. The earliest king authenticated through archaeological evidence is Enmebaragesi of Kish (ca. 26th century BC), whose name is also mentioned in the Gilgamesh epic —leading to the suggestion that Gilgamesh himself might have been a historical king of Uruk. As the Epic of Gilgamesh shows, this period was associated with increased violence. Cities became walled, and increased in size as undefended villages in southern Mesopotamia disappeared. (Gilgamesh is credited with having built the walls of Uruk). [ 1st Dynasty of Lagash ] [ March 2012 ] { Eannatum &apos;s } { Stele of the Vultures } [ Lagash ] ca. 2500–2270 BC The dynasty of Lagash, though omitted from the king list, is well attested through several important monuments and many archaeological finds. Although short-lived, one of the first empires known to history was that of Eannatum of Lagash, who annexed practically all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror as a matter of policy—his Stele of the Vultures has been found, showing violent treatment of enemies. His empire collapsed shortly after his death. He is notable for the policy of having deliberately introduced the use of &quot; terror &quot; as a weapon against his enemies. Later, Lugal-Zage-Si, the priest-king of Umma, overthrew the primacy of the Lagash dynasty in the area, then conquered Uruk, making it his capital, and claimed an empire extending from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. He was the last ethnically Sumerian king before the arrival of the Semitic king, Sargon of Akkad. [ Akkadian Empire ] [ Akkadian Empire ] ca. 2270–2083 BC ( short chronology ) The Semitic Akkadian language is first attested in proper names of the kings of Kish ca. 2800 BC, { Roux, Georges &quot; Ancient Iraq &quot; (Penguin Harmondsworth) } preserved in later king lists. There are texts written entirely in Old Akkadian dating from ca. 2500 BC. Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of Sargon the Great (ca. 2270–2215 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the &quot; Neo-Sumerian Renaissance &quot; that followed it. Speakers of Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted for about one thousand years, until ca. 1800 BC, when Sumerian ceased to be spoken. Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a &quot; Semitic vs. Sumerian &quot; conflict. { Toward the Image of Tammuz and Other Essays on Mesopotamian History and Culture by T. Jacobsen } However, it is certain that Akkadian was also briefly imposed on neighboring parts of Elam that were previously conquered by Sargon. [ Gutian period ] [ Gutian dynasty of Sumer ] ca. 2083–2050 BC ( short chronology ) [ 2nd Dynasty of Lagash ] { Gudea of } { Lagash } [ Lagash ] ca. 2093–2046 BC ( short chronology ) Following the downfall of the Akkadian Empire at the hands of Gutian s, another native Sumerian ruler, Gudea of Lagash, rose to local prominence and continued the practices of the Sargonid kings&apos; claims to divinity. Like the previous Lagash dynasty, Gudea and his descendents also promoted artistic development and left a large number of archaeological artifacts. After the fall of their empire, the Akkadians themselves essentially coalesced into two states; Babylon in the south and Assyria in the north of Mesopotamia. [ Sumerian Renaissance ] { Great Ziggurat of Ur, near } { Nasiriyah, } { Iraq } [ Sumerian renaissance ] ca. 2047–1940 BC ( short chronology ) Later, the 3rd dynasty of Ur under Ur-Nammu and Shulgi, whose power extended as far as northern Mesopotamia, was the last great &quot; Sumerian renaissance &quot;, but already the region was becoming more Semitic than Sumerian, with the rise in power of the Akkadian speaking Semites and the influx of waves of Semitic Martu ( Amorites ) who were later to found the Babylonia n Empire. The Sumerian language, however, remained a sacerdotal language taught in schools in Babylon and Assyria, in the same way that Latin was used in the Medieval period, for as long as cuneiform was utilised. [ Decline ] This period is generally taken to coincide with a major shift in population from southern Mesopotamia toward the north. Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. Soil salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkad ian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths. [ Thompson William R. 2004 Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation Journal of World Systems Research http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol10/number3/pdf/jwsr-v10n3-thompson.pdf PDF 10.1007/s00268-004-7605-z 28 1187–98 15517490 Hay ID 12 ] This greatly weakened the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth Sumerian would remain only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe. Following an Elam ite invasion and sack of Ur during the rule of Ibbi-Sin (ca. 1940 BC), Sumer came under Amorite rule (taken to introduce the Middle Bronze Age ). The independent Amorite states of the 20th to 18th centuries are summarized as the &quot; Dynasty of Isin &quot; in the Sumerian king list, ending with the rise of Babylonia under Hammurabi ca. 1700 BC. During the third millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkad ians, which included widespread bilingualism. [ Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation Deutscher, Guy Guy Deutscher (linguist) Oxford University Press US 2007 978-0-19-953222-3 20–21 http://books.google.com/?id%3DXFwUxmCdG94C ] The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), { Woods C. 2006 “Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian”. In S.L. Sanders (ed) Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture: 91-120 Chicago } but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia (Babylonia and Assyria) until the 1st century AD.

[ Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat Daily life in ancient Mesopotamia http://books.google.com/books?id%3DlbmXsaTGNKUC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA13 29 November 2011 30 September 1998 Greenwood Publishing Group 978-0-313-29497-6 13 ] However, the archaeological record shows clear uninterrupted cultural continuity from the time of the Early Ubaid period (5300 – 4700 BC C-14 ) settlements in southern Mesopotamia. The Sumerian people who settled here farmed the lands in this region that were made fertile by silt deposited by the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. It is speculated by some archaeologists that Sumerian speakers were farmers who moved down from the north, after perfecting irrigation agriculture there [note there is no consensus among scholars on the origins of the Sumerians]. The Ubaid pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via Choga Mami Transitional ware to the pottery of the Samarra period culture (c. 5700 – 4900 BC C-14 ) in the north, who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli (Oueilli, Oueili) near Larsa, excavated by the French in the 1980s, where 8 levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. Farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control, enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment. [ June 2011 ] Others have suggested a continuity of Sumerians, from the indigenous hunter-fisherfolk traditions, associated with the Arabian bifacial assemblages found on the Arabian litorial. The Sumerians themselves claimed kinship with the people of Dilmun, associated with Bahrein in the Persian Gulf. Juris Yarins has suggested that they may have been the people living in the region of the Persian Gulf before it flooded at the end of the Ice Age. [ June 2011 ] [ Culture ] [ Social and family life ] A reconstruction in the British Museum of headgear and necklaces worn by the women in some Sumerian graves In the early Sumerian period (i.e. Uruk), the primitive pictograms suggest that &quot; Pottery was very plentiful, and the forms of the vases, bowls and dishes were manifold; there were special jars for honey, butter, oil and wine, which was probably made from dates, and one form of vase had a spout protruding from its side. Some of the vases had pointed feet, and stood on stands with crossed legs; others were flat-bottomed, and were set on square or rectangular frames of wood. The oil-jars - and probably others also - were sealed with clay, precisely as in early Egypt. Vases and dishes of stone were made in imitation of those of clay, and baskets were woven of reeds or formed of leather. &quot; &quot; A feathered head-dress was worn on the head. Beds, stools and chairs were used, with carved legs resembling those of an ox. There were fire-places and fire-altars, and apparently chimneys also. &quot; &quot; Knives, drills, wedges and an instrument which looks like a saw were all known, while spears, bows, arrows and daggers (but not swords) were employed in war. &quot; &quot; Tablets were used for writing purposes, and copper, gold and silver were worked by the smith. Daggers with metal blades and wooden handles were worn, and copper was hammered into plates, while necklaces or collars were made of gold. &quot; &quot; Time was reckoned in lunar months. &quot; There is considerable evidence that the Sumerians loved music, which seems to have been an important part of religious and civic life in Sumer. Lyres were popular in Sumer. [ March 2012 ] Inscriptions describing the reforms of king Urukagina of Lagash (ca. 2300 BC) say that he abolished the former custom of polyandry in his country, by which a woman who took multiple husbands was stoned with rocks upon which her crime had been written. { &apos;&apos;Gender and the Journal: Diaries and Academic Discourse&apos;&apos; p. 62 by Cinthia Gannett, 1992 } Though women were protected by late Sumerian law and were able to achieve a higher status in Sumer than in other contemporary civilizations, the culture was male-dominated. The Code of Ur-Nammu, the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the Ur-III &quot; Sumerian Renaissance &quot;, reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late Sumerian law. Beneath the lu-gal ( &quot; great man &quot; or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The &quot; lu &quot; or free person, and the slave (male, arad; female geme). The son of a lu was called a dumu-nita until he married. A woman (munus) went from being a daughter (dumu-mi), to a wife (dam), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (numasu) who could remarry. [ Language and writing ] [ Sumerian language Cuneiform ] The most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of tablet s written in cuneiform. Sumerian writing is the oldest example of writing on earth. Although pictures - that is, hieroglyphs were first used, symbols were later made to represent syllables. Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the Sumerian language have survived, such as personal or business letters, receipts, lexical lists, laws, hymns, prayers, stories, daily records, and even libraries full of clay tablet s. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects like statues or bricks are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes-in-training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after Semitic speakers had become the ruling race.The Sumerian language is generally regarded as a language isolate in linguistics because it belongs to no known language family; Akkadian, by contrast belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other language groups. It is an agglutinative language; in other words, morpheme s ( &quot; units of meaning &quot; ) are added together to create words, unlike analytic languages where morphemes are purely added together to create sentences. Understanding Sumerian texts today can be problematic even for experts. [ March 2012 ] Most difficult are the earliest texts, which in many cases do not give the full grammatical structure of the language. During the third millennium BC, they developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkad ians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC, but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Babylonia and Assyria until the 1st century AD. [ Religion ] [ Sumerian religion ] { Tell Asmar votive sculpture 2750-2600 BC. } There was no organized set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings. The Sumerians were probably the first to write down their beliefs, which were the inspiration for much of later Mesopotamian mythology, religion, and astrology. The Sumerians worshipped: [ March 2012 ] Anu as the full time god, equivalent to &quot; heaven &quot; - indeed, the word &quot; an &quot; in Sumerian means &quot; sky &quot; and his consort Ki, means &quot; Earth &quot;. Enki in the south at the temple in Eridu. Enki was the god of beneficence, ruler of the freshwater depths beneath the earth, a healer and friend to humanity who in Sumerian myth was thought to have given humans the arts and sciences, the industries and manners of civilization; the first law-book was considered his creation, Enlil, lord of the ghost-land, in the north at the temple of Nippur. His gifts to mankind were said to be the spells and incantations that the spirits of good or evil were compelled to obey, Inanna, the deification of Venus, the morning (eastern) and evening (western) star, at the temple (shared with An) at Uruk. The sun-god Utu at Ur, The moon god Nanna at Sippar. These deities were probably the original matrix; [ March 2012 ] there were hundreds of minor deities. The Sumerian god s thus had associations with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities&apos; political power. The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. If the temples/gods ruled each city it was for their mutual survival and benefit—the temples organized the mass labor projects needed for irrigation agriculture. Citizens had a labor duty to the temple which they were allowed to avoid by a payment of silver only towards the end of the third millennium. The temple-centered farming communities of Sumer had a social stability that enabled them to survive for four millennia. Sumerians believed that the universe consisted of a flat disk enclosed by a tin dome. The Sumerian afterlife involved a descent into a gloomy netherworld to spend eternity in a wretched existence as a Gidim (ghost). [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dpr8-i1iFnIQC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bsource%3Dgbs_ge_summary_r%26amp%3Bcad%3D0#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia Google Books 2012-03-29 ] Ziggurat s (Sumerian temples) consisted of a forecourt, with a central pond for purification. [ February 2008 ] The temple itself had a central nave with aisles along either side. Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the podium and a mudbrick table for animal and vegetable sacrifice s. Granaries and storehouse s were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style. [ February 2010 ] [ Agriculture and hunting ] By 5000 BC the Sumerians had developed core agricultural techniques including large-scale intensive cultivation of land, mono-cropping, organized irrigation, and the use of a specialized labour force, particularly along the waterway now known as the Shatt al-Arab, from its Persian Gulf delta to the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. [ March 2012 ] The surplus of storable food created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and grazing land. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn required an extensive labor force and division of labor. This organization led to the development of writing (ca. 3500 BC). The Sumerians adopted an agricultural mode of life. In the early Sumerian period (i.e. Uruk), the primitive pictograms suggest that &quot; The sheep, goat, ox and probably ass had been domesticated, the ox being used for draught, and woollen clothing as well as rugs were made from the wool or hair of the two first.... By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields, and the shaduf was already employed for the purpose of irrigation. Plants were also grown in pots or vases. &quot; The Sumerians practiced the same irrigation techniques as those used in Egypt. [ Mackenzie Donald Alexander 1927 Footprints of Early Man Blackie &amp; Son Limited ] American anthropologist Robert McCormick Adams says that irrigation development was associated with urbanization, [ Adams R. McC. 1981 Heartland of Cities University of Chicago Press ] and that 89% of the population lived in the cities. { http://cniss.wustl.edu/workshoppapers/gatpres2a.pdf } [ March 2012 ] They grew barley, chickpea s, lentil s, wheat, date s, onion s, garlic, lettuce, leek s and mustard. They also raised cattle, sheep, goat s, and pig s. They used ox en as their primary beasts of burden and donkey s or equids as their primary transport animal. Sumerians caught many fish and hunted fowl and gazelle. [ The fine art of food Reay Tannahill Folio Society 1968 ] [ March 2012 ] Sumerian agriculture depended heavily on irrigation. The irrigation was accomplished by the use of shaduf s, canal s, channels, dykes, weir s, and reservoirs. The frequent violent floods of the Tigris, and less so, of the Euphrates, meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of silt, and survey markers and boundary stones continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a corvee, although the rich were able to exempt themselves. After the flood season and after the Spring Equinox and the Akitu or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they let oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with pickaxe s. After drying, they plowed, harrowed, and raked the ground three times, and pulverized it with a mattock, before planting seed. Unfortunately the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley as their principal crop. Sumerians harvested during the spring in three-person teams consisting of a reaper, a binder, and a sheaf handler. { By the sweat of thy brow: Work in the Western world, Melvin Kranzberg, Joseph Gies, Putnam, 1975 } The farmers would use threshing wagon s to separate the cereal heads from the stalk s and then use threshing sled s to disengage the grain. They then winnowed the grain/chaff mixture. [ Architecture ] [ Sumerian architecture Ziggurat Mudhif ] The Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex mudbrick, not fixed with mortar or cement. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as tell s, are found throughout the ancient Near East. According to Archibald Sayce, the primitive pictogram s of the early Sumerian (i.e. Uruk) era suggest that &quot; Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. The foundation stones - or rather bricks - of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them. &quot; [ Archibald Sayce Sayce Rev. A. H. http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologyofcun00sayc/archaeologyofcun00sayc_djvu.txt The Archaeology of the Cuneiform Inscriptions &quot; 2nd revised 1908 Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge London, Brighton, New York 98-100 ] The most impressive and famous of Sumerian buildings are the ziggurat s, large layered platforms which supported temples. Some scholars [ March 2012 ] have theorized that these structures might have been the basis of the Tower of Babel described in Genesis. Sumerian cylinder seal s also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 AD. The Sumerians also developed the arch, which enabled them to develop a strong type of roof called a dome. They built this by constructing several arches. Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, [ March 2012 ] such as buttress es, recesses, half column s, and clay nail s. [ Mathematics ] [ Babylonian mathematics ] The Sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BC. This metrology advanced resulting in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication table s on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. { Duncan J. Melville (2003). Third Millennium Chronology, Third Millennium Mathematics. } { St. Lawrence University. } The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. [ Ifrah 2001 11 ] The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.

Wilson Google Books October 14, 2004 2012-03-29 ] [ Economy and trade ] Discoveries of obsidian from far-away locations in Anatolia and lapis lazuli from Badakhshan in northeastern Afghanistan, beads from Dilmun (modern Bahrain ), and several seals inscribed with the Indus Valley script suggest a remarkably wide-ranging network of ancient trade centered around the Persian Gulf. The Epic of Gilgamesh refers to trade with FAR lands for goods such as wood that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, cedar from Lebanon was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen Puabi at Ur, was traded from as far away as Mozambique. The Sumerians used slaves, although they were not a major part of the economy. Slave women worked as weavers, pressers, miller s, and porter s. Sumerian potters decorated pots with cedar oil paint s. The potters used a bow drill to produce the fire needed for baking the pottery. Sumerian masons and jewelers knew and made use of alabaster ( calcite ), ivory, iron, gold, silver, carnelian, and lapis lazuli. { Diplomacy by design: Luxury arts and an &quot; international style &quot; in the ancient Near East, 1400-1200 BCE, Marian H. Feldman, University of Chicago Press, 2006, pp. 120-121 } [ Military ] [ March 2012 ] { Standard of Ur, ca. 2600 BC. } { Stele of the Vultures } The almost constant wars among the Sumerian city-states for 2000 years helped to develop the military technology and techniques of Sumer to a high level. The first war recorded was between Lagash and Umma in ca. 2525 BC on a stele called the Stele of Vultures. [ March 2012 ] It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry. The infantrymen carried spear s, wore copper helmet s and carried leather or wicker shield s. The spearmen are shown arranged in what resembles the phalanx formation, which requires training and discipline; this implies that the Sumerians may have made use of professional soldiers. The Sumerian military used carts harnessed to onager s. These early chariot s functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and lance s. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two- wheel ed device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a woven basket and the wheels had a solid three-piece design. Sumerian cities were surrounded by defensive wall s. The Sumerians engaged in siege warfare between their cities, but the mudbrick walls were able to deter some foes. [ Technology ] Examples of Sumerian technology include: the wheel, cuneiform, arithmetic and geometry, irrigation systems, Sumerian boats, lunisolar calendar, bronze, leather, saw s, chisel s, hammer s, brace s, bit s, nail s, pin s, ring s, hoe s, axe s, knives, lance points, arrowheads, sword s, glue, dagger s, waterskin s, bags, harness es, armor, quiver s, war chariot s, scabbard s, boot s, sandals, harpoon s, and beer.The Sumerians had three main types of boats: [ March 2012 ] clinker-built sailboats stitched together with hair, featuring bitumen waterproofing skin boats constructed from animal skins and reeds wooden-oared ships, sometimes pulled upstream by people and animals walking along the nearby banks [ Legacy ] Evidence of wheel ed vehicles appeared in the mid 4th millennium BC, near-simultaneously in Mesopotamia, the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe. The wheel initially took the form of the potter&apos;s wheel. The new concept quickly led to wheeled vehicles and mill wheels. The Sumerians&apos; cuneiform writing system is the oldest which has been deciphered (the status of older inscriptions such as the Vinča signs and the even older Jiahu symbols is controversial). The Sumerians were among the first astronomers, mapping the stars into sets of constellations, many of which survived in the zodiac and were also recognized by the ancient Greeks. [ Gary Thompson http://members.optusnet.com.au/~gtosiris/page11-4.html History of Constellation and Star Names Members.optusnet.com.au 2012-03-29 ] [ y March 2012 ] They were also aware of the five planets that are visible to the naked eye. [ http://www.sumerian.org/sumerfaq.htm#s39 Sumerian Questions and Answers Sumerian.org 2012-03-29 ] They invented and developed arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6. This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry, cavalry, and archers. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true city states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what is now Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state&apos;s primary temple. Finally, the Sumerians ushered in the age of intensive agriculture and irrigation. Emmer wheat, barley, sheep (starting as mouflon ), and cattle (starting as aurochs ) were foremost among the species cultivated and raised for the first time on a grand scale.
