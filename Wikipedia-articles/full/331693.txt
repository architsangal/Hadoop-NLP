Charter schools are primary or secondary schools that receive public money (and like other schools, may also receive private donation s ) but are not subject to some of the rules, regulations, and statutes that apply to other public schools in exchange for some type of accountability for producing certain results, which are set forth in each school&apos;s charter.

At the time, a few schools already existed that were not called charter schools but embodied some of their principles, such as H-B Woodlawn. As originally conceived, the ideal model of a charter school was as a legally and financially autonomous public school (without tuition, religious affiliation, or selective student admissions) that would operate much like a private business—free from many state laws and district regulations, and accountable more for student outcomes rather than for processes or inputs (such as Carnegie Units and teacher certification requirements). Minnesota was the first state to pass a charter school law in 1991. California was second, in 1992. As of 2009, 41 states and the District of Columbia have charter school laws. [ Charter School Laws Across the States Center for Education Reform http://www.edreform.com/About_CER/Charter_School_Laws_Across_the_States/index.cfm ] [ Structure and characteristics ] There are two principles that guide charter schools. First is that they will operate as autonomous public schools, through waivers from many of the procedural requirements of district public schools. These waivers do not mean a school is exempt from the same educational standards set by the State or district. Autonomy can be critically important for creating a school culture that maximizes student motivation by emphasizing high expectations, academic rigor, discipline, and relationships with caring adults.

A charter school is authorized to function once it has received a charter, a statutorily defined performance contract detailing the school&apos;s mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment, and ways to measure success. The length of time for which charters are granted varies, but most are granted for 3–5 years. Charter schools are held accountable to their sponsor—a local school board, state education agency, university, or other entity—to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract. While this accountability is one of the key arguments in favor of charters, evidence gathered by the United States Department of Education suggests that charter schools are not, in practice, held to higher standards of accountability than traditional public schools. That point can be refuted by examining the number of traditional public schools that have been closed due to students&apos; poor performance on end-of-course/end-of-grade tests. Typically, these schools are allowed to remain open, perhaps with new leadership or restructuring, or perhaps with no change at all. Charter school proponents assert that charter schools are not given the opportunities to restructure often and are simply closed down when students perform poorly on these assessments. Many charter schools are created with the original intent of providing a unique and innovative educational experience to its students; one that cannot be matched by the traditional public schools. While some charter schools succeed in this objective, many succumb to the same pressures of its public school brethren. Charter schools are accountable for test scores, state mandates, and other traditional requirements that often have the effect of turning the charter school into a similar model and design as the public schools. [ Mathew Welch Eight-year study and charter legitimacy Journal of Education 191 2 Winter 2011 55–65 ] Although the U.S. Department of Education&apos;s findings agree with those of the National Education Association (NEA), their study points out the limitations of such studies and the inability to hold constant other important factors, and notes that &quot; study design does not allow us to determine whether or not traditional public schools are more effective than charter schools. &quot; [ http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/choice/pcsp-final/execsum.html Executive Summary--Evaluation of the Public Charter Schools Program: Final Report US Department of Education November 19, 2004 July 27, 2009 ] [ Chartering authorities ] Chartering authorizers, entities that may legally issue charters, differ from state to state, as do the bodies that are legally entitled to apply for and operate under such charters. In some states, like Arkansas, the State Board of Education authorizes charters. In other states, like Maryland, only the local school district may issue charters. States including Arizona and the District of Columbia have created independent charter-authorizing bodies to which applicants may apply for a charter. The laws that permit the most charter development, as seen in Minnesota and Michigan, allow for a combination of such authorizers.

Although an estimated 365,000 students are on charter school wait lists nationwide, these states restrict the number of charter schools that may be authorized and/or the number of students a single school can enroll. Many of these caps are the result of political trade-offs among competing political interests. { &quot; Caps on Charter Schools. &quot; (March 2009).

Charters tend to be small (fewer than 200 students) and represent primarily new schools, though some schools had converted to charter status. Charter schools often tend to exist in urban locations, rather than rural. This study found enormous variation among states. Charter schools tended to be somewhat more racially diverse, and to enroll slightly fewer students with special needs or limited English proficiency than the average schools in their state.

In many states, charter schools are funded by transferring per-pupil state aid from the school district where the charter school student resides. Charters are, on average, receiving less money per-pupil than the corresponding public schools in their areas, though the average figure is controversial because some charter schools do not enroll an equal number of students that require significant special education or student support services. Additionally, some charters are not required to provide transportation and nutrition services.

Fordam Institute August 2005 January 21, 2008 ] found that across 16 states and the District of Columbia—which collectively enroll 84 percent of the nation’s one million charter school students—charter schools receive about 22 percent less in per-pupil public funding than the district schools that surround them, a difference of about $1,800. For a typical charter school of 250 students, that amounts to about $450,000 per year. The study asserts that the funding gap is wider in most of twenty-seven urban school districts studied, where it amounts to $2,200 per student, and that in cities like San Diego and Atlanta, charters receive 40% less than traditional public schools. The fiscal inequity is most severe in South Carolina, California, Ohio, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The report suggests that the primary driver of the district-charter funding gap is charter schools’ lack of access to local and capital funding. A 2008 study that looked at charter school funding in all 40 charter states and the District of Columbia found that charter students are funded on average at 61 cents compared to every dollar for their district peers, with charter funding averaging $6,585 per pupil compared to $10,771 per pupil at conventional district public schools.

The state government of Texas approved the formation of charter schools in 1995.

Sunday December 17, 2006. B1 MetFront. Retrieved on November 7, 2009. } Undoubtedly the most radical experimentation with charter schools has occurred in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The New Orleans Public Schools system is currently engaged in reforms aimed at decentralizing power away from the pre-Katrina school board central bureaucracy to individual school principals and charter school boards, monitoring charter school performance by granting renewable, five-year operating contracts permitting the closure of those not succeeding, and vesting choice in parents of public school students, allowing them to enroll their children in almost any school in the district. { Vallas wants no return to old ways, The Times-Picayune, July 25, 2009. } New Orleans is the only city in the nation where the majority of public school students attend charter schools. Unlike their counterpart, charter school laws greatly vary from state to state. This can best be seen by using the examples of the three states with the highest number of students enrolled in charter schools, California, Arizona, and Michigan. { Powers, Jeanne M. &quot; Charter Schools. &quot; Encyclopedia of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education. 2008. SAGE Publications. 5 Dec. 2011. } These differences largely fall under the categories of what types of public agencies are permitted to authorize the creation of charter schools, whether or not and how private schools can convert to charter schools, and whether or not charter school teachers need to be certified and what that consists of. Firstly, charters for charter schools in California are for the most part granted by local school districts. However, if a charter is denied by a local school district or the school provides services not provided by the local school districts, the charter can be granted by county board of superintendent of schools and then the state board of education. { Premack, Eric. &quot; Charter schools: California&apos;s education reform &apos;power tool.&apos;(Special Section on Charter Schools). &quot; Phi Delta Kappan 78.1 (1996): 60+.

They can also be given charters by local school districts and the state board of education. In contrast, charter schools, which in Michigan are known as Public School Academies, can be authorized for creation by local school boards or the governing school boards of state colleges and universities. { Lacireno-Paquet, Natalie. &quot; Moving Foward of Sliding Backward: The Evolution of Charter School Policies in Michigan and the District of Columbia. &quot; Educational policy (Los Altos, Calif.). 21.

In referring to whether nor not a state allows private schools to convert into a charter school, one too can easily see the variation state to state. California for example does not allow the conversion of a pre-existing private school into a charter school, but both Arizona and Michigan do allow private schools to convert, but with differing requirements. Private schools wishing to convert to charter schools in Michigan must show that at least twenty-five percent of their student population be that of new students. Arizona private schools that desire to switch to charter schools must have admissions that are fair and offer nondiscriminatory acceptance. Also, while Michigan and California require teachers at charter schools to hold state certification, those in Arizona do not. Reports indicate that schools transferring from a traditional school setting to a charter school type setting will inherently be at a disadvantage due to the lack of background structure when compared to schools that have been around for quite a while. As proven by this state to state differentiation in regards to charter school law, one can easily see it is not unified. Though, the Public Charter Schools Program, which is funded by the federal government and is delivered via the state departments of education does affect every state’s charter schools. It also helps to provide much needed research on charter schools via funding. Also, charter schools were selected as a large component of the No Child Left Behind Act on 2002. Specifically, it stated that students that attended schools labeled as under performing by state standards the right to have the option to transfer to a different school in the district whether it be charter school or not, thus making charter schools an option for students attending an under performing school. No Child Left Behind also suggested an outline that would entail under performing schools possibly being reorganized into charter schools. It sanctions that if a failing school cannot be shown to be making adequate yearly progress than it will be transformed into a charter school. North Carolina is currently home to almost one hundred charter schools, its limit as per the legislation that passed in 1996 that legally allowed charter schools to exist in North Carolina. { Knight, Meghan. &quot; Cyber Charter Schools: An Analysis of North Carolina&apos;s Current Charter School Legislation. &quot; North Carolina journal of law. 6. (2005): 395. Web. 6 Dec. 2011. http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ncjl6. } This legislation also dictates that there will be no more than five charter schools operating within one school district during the same year. It was passed to offer parents different options in regards to their children and the school they attend, all with most of the cost being covered by tax revenue. There has recently been activity surrounding the issue of raising the state cap of one hundred to one hundred and ten. When the legislation was first passed to allow charter schools in North Carolina, the following couple of years thirty-four charter schools were opened. Within the next few years there were ninety-nine charter schools opened with an estimated 16,000 students. Furthermore, after the first several years of the charter schools being allowed in North Carolina the institutions with the authority to grant charters was shifted from local boards of education to that of the State Board of Education. This can also be compared with several other states that have multiple different powers who accept the charter school applications. When compared to the number of charter schools across the nation, which is around 3,000, North Carolina does indeed seem to be but a small part of the charter school system, especially when compared to the top three states in regard to the number of charter schools, Arizona, California, and Michigan. And while the number of charter schools in North Carolina is growing, it has yet to produce a cyber charter school, despite a handful of applications for this cutting edge educational system, which in theory better prepares a student for work in newer technical world. Cyber charter schools operate like a typical charter school in regards to being an independently organized school, but allows for much more flexibility and to break the confines of traditional schools. Between 1999 and 2003 about sixty cyber charter schools have opened with over 16,000 students being served. These cyber charter schools were created in fifteen states and approximately accounts for two percent of all charter school students. They allow for students to be taught over the internet while meeting with teachers and students only for certain activities. It also allows for students to attend the cyber charter school and not necessarily be located in that local school district. It can inherently be seen that many very different problems may arise in cyber charter schools when compared to typical charter schools or traditional schools. And, with most cyber charter schools being ruled by the original legislation created for regular charter schools, one can also see that the cyber charter schools could have a hard time addressing their problems. Because of this problem, four states have adopted more specific legislation that directly tailors to cyber charter schools. A prime example of a state’s cyber schools seeing an increase in implementation is Arizona. With about 3,500 students in their cyber schools, with about half of them being cyber charter schools and the other half being governed by normal public school districts. The cyber schools teach students from kindergarten to twelfth grade, and the setting varies from being entirely online in one’s home or spending all of the class time in a formal school building whilst learning over the internet. As of December 2011, there are now approximately 5,600 public charter schools enrolling what is estimated to be more than two million students nationwide. The numbers equate to a 13 percent growth in students in just one year, while more than 400,000 students remain on wait lists to attend the public school of their choice. Over 500 new public charter schools opened their doors in the 2011-12 school year, an estimated increase of 200,000 students. This year marks the largest single–year increase ever recorded in terms of the number of additional students attending charters.

The National-ACT alliance intends to set up charter schools as alternatives to state schools, in some cases taking over the facilities of a state school. Schools would be operated by private business es or organisations such as churches and tribal groups, and would be directly accountable for performance to the organizations running them, unlike state schools where they are accountable to the Government. The schools would receive state funding and private donations, but have the same freedoms as private schools in matters such as in setting the curriculum, length of the school day/year and teachers&apos; pay. Schools would still be subject to external reviews (most likely by the Education Review Office ), and the government would still have the power to sack an organisation running a school on poor performance.

[ 2010 ] there were 22 charter schools in the province, operated by 13 charter school authorities, { Ritchie, at 11. } compared with over 50 school boards, with the largest one alone having over 200 schools. [ March 2011 ] The idea of charter schools initially sparked great debate and is still controversial, but has had limited impact. [ March 2011 ] [ 2010 ], Alberta remains the only Canadian province that has enabled charter schools. { Ritchie, at 3. } [ Chile ] Chile has a long history of private subsidized schooling, akin to charter schooling in the United States. Before the 1980s, most private subsidized schools were religious and owned by churches or other private parties, but they received support from the central government. In the 1980s, the dictatorial government of Augusto Pinochet promoted neoliberal reforms in the country. In 1981 a competitive voucher system in education was adopted.

After this reform, the number of private subsidized schools, many of them secular, grew from 18.5% of schools in 1980 to 32.7% of schools in 2001.

[ Sweden ] [ Education in Sweden ] The Swedish system of &quot; friskolor &quot; or &quot; independent schools &quot; was instituted in 1992. These charter schools are publicly funded by restricted school voucher s and can be run by not-for-profits as well as for-profit companies. The schools are severely restricted in their operations - e.g. their charter prohibits supplementing the public funds with tuition or other fees, and pupils must be admitted on a first-come, first-served basis - entrance exams are not permitted. [ http://www.economist.com/node/11535645 The Swedish model 12 June 2008 The Economist ] There are about 900 charter schools throughout the country. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/politics_show/7471335.stm Free schools 26 June 2008 BBC News Online ] The system can be best described as outsourced public education - still, despite its limitations, perhaps because it is the only alternative to government-operated schools, it has grown quite popular - especially around larger metropolitan areas. [ National evaluations of charter schools ] One obvious question charter schools face is whether they actually improve educational outcomes, which is their stated purpose. In the interest of testing this assertion, a number of researchers and organizations have examined educational outcomes for students who attend charter schools. [ Center for Research on Education Outcomes ] A study done by Stanford University found that charter schools on average perform about the same or worse compared to public schools. In 2009, the most authoritative study of charter schools was conducted by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) at Stanford University. The report is the first detailed national assessment of charter schools. It analyzed 70% of the nation&apos;s students attending charter schools and compared the academic progress of those students with that of demographically matched students in nearby public schools. The report found that 17% of charter schools reported academic gains that were significantly better than traditional public schools; 46% showed no difference from public schools; and 37% were significantly worse than their traditional public school counterparts. The authors of the report consider this a &quot; sobering &quot; finding about the quality of charter schools in the U.S. Charter schools showed a significantly greater variation in quality as compared with the more standardized public schools with many falling below public school performances and a few exceeding them significantly. Results vary for various demographics with Black and Hispanic children not doing as well as they would in public schools, but with children from poverty backgrounds, students learning English, and brighter students doing better; average students do poorer. While the obvious solution to the widely varying quality of charter schools would be to close those who perform below the level of public schools, this is hard to accomplish in practice as even a poor school has its supporters. [ Multiple Choice: Charter School Performance in 16 States http://credo.stanford.edu Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) PDF 2009 ] [ Criticism and debate ] Stanford economist Caroline Hoxby criticized the study, resulting in a written debate with the authors. She originally argued the study &quot; contains a serious statistical mistake that causes a negative bias in its estimate of how charter schools affect achievement, &quot; { &quot; A Serious Statistical Mistake In The CREDO Study of Charter Schools &quot; } but after CREDO countered the remarks, saying Hoxby&apos;s &quot; memo is riddled with serious errors &quot; { &quot; Fact vs. Fiction: An Analysis of Dr. Hoxby’s Misrepresentation of CREDO’s Research &quot; } Hoxby revised her original criticism. { &quot; A Statistical Mistake In The CREDO Study of Charter Schools &quot; } The debate ended with a written &quot; Finale &quot; by CREDO that rebuts both Hoxby&apos;s original and revised criticism. { &quot; CREDO Finale to Hoxby’s Revised Memorandum &quot; } [ National Bureau of Economic Research study ] In 2004, the National Bureau of Economic Research found data that suggested Charter Schools increase competition in a given jurisdiction, thus improving the quality of traditional public schools (noncharters) in the area. Using end-of-year test scores for grades three through eight from North Carolina&apos;s state testing program, researchers found that charter school competition raised the composite test scores in district schools, even though the students leaving district schools for the charters tended to have above average test scores. The introduction of charter schools in the state caused an approximate one percent increase in the score, which constitutes about one quarter of the average yearly growth. The gain was roughly two to five times greater than the gain from decreasing the student-faculty ratio by 1. This research could partially explain how other studies have found a small significant difference in comparing educational outcomes between charter and traditional public schools. It may be that in some cases, charter schools actually improve other public schools by raising educational standards in the area. [ Holmes George M. DeSimon, Jeff and Rupp, Nicholas G.

[ Criticism ] The paper was the subject of controversy in 2005 when Princeton assistant professor Jesse Rothstein was unable to replicate her results. Hoxby&apos;s methodology in this study has also been criticized, arguing that Hoxby&apos;s &quot; assessment of school outcomes is based on the share of students who are proficient at reading or math but not the average test score of the students.

The study also looks at whether individual charter schools improve their performance with age (e.g. after overcoming start-up challenges). Of these, five of seven studies find that as charter schools mature, they improve. The other two find no significant differences between older and younger charter schools. A more recent synthesis of findings conducted by Vanderbilt University indicates that solid conclusions cannot be drawn from the existing studies, due to their methodological shortcomings and conflicting results, and proposes standards for future meta-analyses.

The report performed analyses using both statistical controls and using pilot and charter applicant lotteries. The results using statistical controls to control for demographic and baseline state test scores found a positive effect among charter schools similar to a year spent in one of Boston’s selective exam schools, with math scores, for instance, showing positive effects of 0.18 and 0.22 standard deviations for charter middle and high schools respectively compared to an effect of 0.20 and 0.16 standard deviations for exam schools. For pilot schools, the report found that in the middle school grades pilot school students modestly underperform relatives to similar students attending traditional BPS schools (-0.05 standard deviations in ELA and -0.07 in math) while showing slightly positive results in the high school grades for pilot schools (0.15 standard deviations for writing and 0.06 for math). The results using a sub-sample of schools with random lottery results found very large positive effects in both math and ELA scores for charter schools, including 0.16 and 0.19 standard deviations in middle and high school ELA scores respectively and 0.36 and 0.17 standard deviations in middle and high school math scores respectively. Boston’s pilot schools, however, showed a concerning negative effect in middle school math and ELA and a slightly positive effect in high school. [ New Orleans ] A recent case study by the Harvard Business School examined the charter school reform efforts in New Orleans. [ Childress Stacey DeSimon, Jeff and Rupp, Nicholas G. Public Education in New Orleans: Pursuing Systemic Change through Entrepreneurship Harvard Business School Publishing 2010 ] After Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of New Orleans in 2005, the state of Louisiana took over 102 of the 118 public schools and shifted management to a system of schools. The district is now composed of 70 Recovery Schools District (RSD) schools managed by the state (including 37 RSD charter schools) and 16 schools managed by the local Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB) (including 12 OPSB charter schools). Charter schools now account for more than 60% of the public schools in New Orleans. When evaluating New Orleans’ schools against the 200 point index called the State Performance Index (SPI), 19 of the 20 highest performing non-selective schools were charter schools. Charter schools affiliated with charter management organizations such as KIPP tended to perform better than stand-alone schools. The overall percentage of schools performing below the failing mark of 60 fell from 64% in 2005 to 36% in 2009. [ Policy and practice ] As more states start charter schools, there is increasing speculation about upcoming legislation. In an innovation-diffusion study surveying education policy experts in fifty states, Michael Mintrom and Sandra Vergari (1997) found that charter legislation is more likely to be considered in states with poor test scores, Republican legislative control, and proximity to other states with charter schools. Legislative enthusiasm, gubernatorial support, interactions with national authorities, and use of permissive charter-law models increase the chances for adopting what they consider stronger laws. He feels union support and restrictive models lead to adoption of what he considers weaker laws. The threat of vouchers, wavering support for public education, and bipartisan support for charters has led some unions to start charters themselves. Several AFT chapters, such as those in Houston and Dallas, have themselves started charters. The National Education Association has allocated $1.5 million to help members start charter schools. Proponents claim that charters offer teachers a measure of empowerment, employee ownership, and governance that might be enhanced by union assistance (Nathan). Former President Bush&apos;s No Child Left Behind Act also promotes charter schools. Over two dozen private management companies are scrambling to increase their 10 percent share of a &quot; more hospitable and entrepreneurial market &quot; (Stecklow 1997). Boston-based Advantage Schools Inc., a corporation specializing in for-profit schooling, has contracted to run charter schools in New Jersey, Arizona, and North Carolina. The Education Development Corporation was planning in the summer of 1997 to manage nine nonsectarian charter schools in Michigan, using cost-cutting measures employed in Christian schools. [ Public opinion ] Historically, Americans have been hesitant to the idea of Charter schools, often with more opposition than support.

However, openness to Charter schools has been increasing [ http://educationnext.org/meeting-of-the-minds/ Meeting of the Minds Education Next 2011 11 January 28, 2011 ] especially among minority communities who have shifted opinions higher than the national average. A 2011 Phi Delta Kappa International-Gallup Poll reported that public support for charter schools stood at a &quot; decade-high &quot; of 70%. { Charter Schools Insider, August 18, 2011 } Charter schools provide an alternative for educators, families and communities who are dissatisfied with educational quality and school district bureaucracies at noncharter schools. In early 2008, the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, a pro-charter organization, conducted two polls in primarily conservative states Idaho and Nevada where they asked parents about their preferences concerning education. In Idaho, only 12% of respondents said that their regular public school was their top choice for the children’s school. Most preferred private schools over other options.

The charter approach uses market principles from the private sector, including accountability and consumer choice, to offer new public sector options that remain nonsectarian and non-exclusive. Many people, such as former President Bill Clinton, see charter schools, with their emphasis on autonomy and accountability, as a workable political compromise and an alternative to vouchers. Others, such as former President George W. Bush, see charter schools as a way to improve schools without antagonizing the teachers&apos; union. Bush made charter schools a major part of his No Child Left Behind Act.

According to Dillon, &quot; In order to pressure all public schools to improve and to raise student achievement overall, school choice reforms need to not just increase the supply of any schools. They need to increase the supply of good schools, and parents who know how to find them. &quot; Drawing lessons from successful food and banking enterprises located in poor, inner-city neighborhoods, the report recommends that policymakers enhance the charter school market by providing more information to consumers, forging community partnerships, allowing for more flexible school financing, and mapping the quality of the education market. [ Debate over funding ] Nearly all charter schools face implementation obstacles, but newly created schools are most vulnerable. Some charter advocates claim that new charters tend to be plagued by resource limitations, particularly inadequate startup funds. Yet a few charter schools also attract large amounts of interest and money from private sources such as the Gates Foundation, the Walton Family Foundation, the Broad Foundation, and the NewSchools Venture Fund. { On NewSchools Venture Fund and funding generally: Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., p. [254] ( &quot; NewSchools &quot; so in original). } Sometimes private businesses and foundations, such as the Ameritech Corporation in Michigan and the Annenberg Fund in California, provide support.

In reality, this is not necessarily the case in the complex world of school funding. Charter schools in California were guaranteed a set amount of district funding that in some districts amounted to $800 per student per year more than traditional public schools received until a new law was passed that took effect in fall 2006. Charter advocates claim that their schools generally lack access to funding for facilities and special program funds distributed on a district basis.

A study funded by the American Federation of Teachers found that in DC charter schools, private funding accounted for $780 per pupil on average and, combined with a higher level of public funding in some charters (mostly due to non-district funding), resulted in considerably higher funding when compared to comparable public schools.

With federal, private, and &quot; other income &quot;, charter school funding shot up to an average of $11,644 versus the district $10,384 per pupil. The median here showed an even more unequal distribution of the funds with a median of $10,333. Other research, using different funding data for DC schools and including funding for school facilities, finds conflicting results. [ http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CollegesandDepartments/Teachers/Schools/Charter/CharterFunding.aspx Charter School Funding: Inequity Persists Ball State University May 2010 June 20, 2010 ] Charters sometimes face opposition from local boards, state education agencies, and unions. Many educators are concerned that charter schools might siphon off badly needed funds for regular schools, as well as students. In addition, public-school advocates assert that charter schools are designed to compete with public schools in a destructive and harmful manner rather than work in harmony with them. To minimize these harmful effects, the American Federation of Teachers urges that charter schools adopt high standards, hire only certified teachers, and maintain teachers&apos; collective-bargaining rights. [ Co-location ] Co-location or collocation of charter schools in public noncharter school buildings has been practiced in both New York City and Chicago { Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., pp. 133–134. } and is controversial. { Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., pp. 133–135 &amp; 142. } Since students planning to attend charter schools are generally students who would have attended noncharter schools, co-location permits re-assigning seating for the same students from one kind of school to the other in the same building, { Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., p. 134. } so that, while space might have to be rebuilt, entire schools do not have to be built from the ground up. The cost savings let more charter schools open. Co-location also permits the two kinds of schools to be visible to each other, thereby promoting school reform, especially within families whose children attend both schools in the same building. { Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., pp. 134–135. } It may also mean that a government administration responsible for overseeing noncharter public schools loses political turf as it gives up space to independently-run charter schools. [ Critiques of charter schools ] [ Difficulties with accountability ] The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for greater accountability. They are meant to be held accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups, including the sponsor that grants them, the parents who choose them, and the public that funds them. Charter schools can theoretically be closed for failing to meet the terms set forth in their charter, but in practice, this can be difficult, divisive, and controversial. One example was the 2003 revocation of the charter for a school called Urban Pioneer in the San Francisco Unified School District, which first came under scrutiny when two students died on a school wilderness outing.

There is also the case of California Charter Academy, where a publicly funded but privately run chain of 60 charter schools became insolvent in August 2004, despite a budget of $100  million, which left thousands of children without a school to attend. In March 2009, the Center for Education Reform released its latest data on charter school closures. At that time they found that 657 of the more than 5250 charter schools that have ever opened had closed, for reasons ranging from district consolidation to failure to attract students. The study found that &quot; 41 percent of the nation&apos;s charter closures resulted from financial deficiencies caused by either low student enrollment or inequitable funding, &quot; while 14% had closed due to poor academic performance. The report also found that the absence of achievement data &quot; correlates directly with the weakness of a state&apos;s charter school law. For example, states like Iowa, Mississippi, Virginia and Wyoming have laws ranked either &quot; D &quot; or &quot; F &quot;. Progress among these schools has not been tracked objectively or clearly. &quot; A 2005 paper found that in Connecticut, which it characterized as having been highly selective in approving charter applications, a relatively large proportion of poorly performing charter schools have closed.

[ National Charter School &amp; Enrollment Statistics Center for Education Reform March 2009 http://www.edreform.com/_upload/CER_charter_numbers.pdf ] Of those, 3 closed for financial reasons. Charter school students in Connecticut are funded on average $4,278 less than regular public school students. In a September 2007 public policy report, education experts Andrew Rotherham and Sara Mead of Education Sector offered a series of recommendations to improve charter school quality through increased accountability. Some of their recommendations urged policymakers to: (i) provide more public oversight of charter school authorizers, including the removal of poor-quality authorizers, (ii) improve the quality of student performance data with more longitudinal student-linked data and multiple measures of school performance, and (iii) clarify state laws related to charter school closure, especially the treatment of displaced students.

However, the Charter movement is said to have shifted into an effort to privatize education and attack teachers&apos; unions. Education historian Diane Ravitch has estimated, as a &quot; safe guess, &quot; that 95% of charters in the United States are non-union and has said that charters follow an unsustainable practice of requiring teachers to work unusually long hours. { Part II: Leading Education Scholar Diane Ravitch on &quot; The Death and Life of the Great American School System &quot;, } { Democracy Now } [ Lower student test scores and teacher issues ] According to a study done by Vanderbilt University, teachers in charter schools are 132% more likely to leave teaching than a public school teacher.

If the goal is increased competition, parents can examine the data and avoid the failing charters, while favoring the successful charters, and chartering institutions can decline to continue to support charters with mediocre performance.

Phillips ] It is as yet unclear whether charters&apos; lackluster test results will affect the enacting of future legislation. A Pennsylvania legislator who voted to create charter schools, State Rep. Mark B. Cohen of Philadelphia, said that &quot; Charter schools offer increased flexibility to parents and administrators, but at a cost of reduced job security to school personnel. The evidence to date shows that the higher turnover of staff undermines school performance more than it enhances it, and that the problems of urban education are far too great for enhanced managerial authority to solve in the absence of far greater resources of staff, technology, and state of the art buildings. &quot; [ Race to the Top: A Practitioner’s Perspective http://www.educationnews.org/ed_reports/105390.html EducationNews 2010-01-08 ] [ Admissions lottery ] When admission depends on a random lottery, some hopeful applicants may be disappointed.

[ Collective bargaining ] Concern has also been raised about the exemption of charter school teachers from states&apos; collective bargaining laws, especially because &quot; charter school teachers are even more likely than traditional public school teachers to be beset by the burn-out caused by working long hours, in poor facilities. &quot; [ Dodd Victoria J.

He said that after two years of researching school reform, he understood the complexities. He reversed his view of union leader Randi Weingarten and suggested she run the school system for a city. { Teaching With the Enemy by Joe Nocera, New York Times, November 7, 2011. } [ Racial segregation ] One study states that charter schools increase racial segregation.
