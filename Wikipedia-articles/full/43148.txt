[ Pliciloricus_enigmatus.jpg Pliciloricus enigmatus Kristensen, 1983 Genera 1 ] [ Loricifera ] Loricifera (from Latin, lorica, corselet + ferre, to bear) is a phylum of very small to microscopic marine sediment-dwelling animals with twenty-two described species, in eight genera. { Gad, G. 2005. Successive reduction of the last instar larva of Loricifera, as evidenced by two new species of Pliciloricus from the Great Meteor Seamount (Atlantic Ocean). Zoologischer Anzeiger. 243: 239–271. } { Ruppert, Edward E., Richard S. Fox, and Robert D. Barnes. Invertebrate Zoology. 7th ed. Toronto: Brooks/Cole — Thomson Learning, 2004. 776. } Aside from these described species, there are approximately 100 more that have been collected and not yet described. Their size ranges from 100  µm to ca. 1  mm. { Heiner, I. 2005. Preliminary account of the loriciferan fauna of the Faroe Bank (NE Atlantic). Biofar Proceedings 2005: 213–219. } They are characterised by a protective outer case called a lorica and their habitat, which is in the spaces between marine gravel to which they attach themselves. The phylum was discovered in 1983 by Reinhardt Kristensen, in Roscoff, France. { Heiner, I., Kristensen, R.H. 2005. Two new species of the genus Pliciloricus (Loricifera, Pliciloricidae) from the Faroe Bank, North Atlantic. Zoologischer Anzeiger. 243: 121–138. } They are among the most recently discovered groups of Metazoan s. { Kristensen, R.M. 2002. An Introduction to Loricifera, Cycliophora, and Micrognathozoa. Integrative and Comparative Biology. 42: 641–651. } They attach themselves quite firmly to the substratum, and hence remained undiscovered for so long. The first specimen was collected in the 1970s, and later described in 1983. They are found at all depths, in different sediment types, and in all latitudes. [ Morphology ] The animals have a head, mouth and digestive system as well as a lorica. The armor-like lorica consists of a protective external shell or case of encircling plicae. There is no circulatory system and no endocrine system. Many of the larvae are acoelomate, with some adults being pseudocoelomate, and some remaining acoelomate. Development is generally direct, though there are so called Higgins-larva e, which differ from adults in several respects. The animals have two sexes as adults. Very complex and plastic life cycle s of pliciloricids include also paedogenetic stages with different forms of parthenogenetic reproduction. They are not known to be present in the fossil record. [ Taxonomic affinity ] Morphological studies have traditionlally placed the phylum in the vinctiplicata with the Priapulida; this plus the Kinorhyncha constitutes the taxon Scalidophora. The three phyla share four characters in common — chitinous cuticle, rings of scalid s on the introvert, flosculi, and two rings of introvert retracts. However, mounting molecular evidence indicates a closer relationship with the nematomorpha.

Scale bar is 50 μm. } [ Evolutionary history ] The loricates are believed to be miniaturized descendants of a larger organism perhaps resembling the Cambrian fossil Sirilorica. However, the fossil record of the microscopic non-mineralized group is (perhaps unsurprisingly) scarce, so it is difficult to trace out the phylum&apos;s evolutionary history in any detail. [ In anoxic environment ] Three species of Loricifera have been found in the sediments at the bottom of the L&apos;Atalante basin in Mediterranean Sea, more than 3,000 meters down, the first multicellular organisms known to spend their entire lives in an oxygen-free environment. They are able to do this because they rely on hydrogenosome s (or similar organelles) instead of on mitochondria for energy. [ Fang Janet Animals thrive without oxygen at sea bottom Nature 464 7290 825 Nature Publishing Group 4-6-2010 http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100406/full/464825b.html 10.1038/464825b 4-6-2010 20376121 ] [ Milius Susan Multicelled animals may live oxygen-free Science News Society for Science and the Public 9 April 2010 http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/58154 11 April 2010 ] The newly reported animals complete their life cycle in the total absence of light and oxygen, and they are less than a millimetre in size. They were collected from a deep basin at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, where they inhabit a nearly salt-saturated brine that, because of its density ( &gt;  1.2  g/cm³), does not mix with the waters above. As a consequence, this environment is completely anoxic and, due to the activity of sulphate reducers, contains sulphide at a concentration of 2.9 mM. Despite such harsh conditions, this anoxic and sulphidic environment is teeming with microbial life, both chemosynthetic prokaryotes that are primary producer s, and a broad diversity of eukaryotic heterotroph s at the next trophic level.
