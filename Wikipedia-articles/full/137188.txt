Its proximity to the ghost town of Silver Reef, the Pine Valley Mountains, and Zion National Park have changed the local economy base from agriculture to tourism. [ Mexican Marijuana Cartel Operations ] On June 17, 2009, Utah Police and forest rangers destroyed about 8,750 marijuana plants growing in Washington County. Law enforcement reported Mexican cartels have moved their growing operations to Utah to avoid the U.S.-Mexico border and police pressure in California. There were no arrests made and the marijuana fields were in the Pine Valley Mountains near Leeds. Doug Roe, a special agent with the U.S. Forest Service, said the plants were young and not ready for harvesting. { http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_12607822 } { http://www.kcsg.com/news/regional/48304912.html } [ See also ] Dixie National Forest Pine Valley Mountain Wilderness Passage to Zarahemla, children&apos;s film set in Leeds.
