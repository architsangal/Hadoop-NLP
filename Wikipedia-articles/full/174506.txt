[ September 2010 ] [ England 51.289 -0.354 Fetcham Surrey 8,300 Mole Valley Surrey South East England Mole Valley Leatherhead KT KT 01372 TQ147557 ] Fetcham is a village in Surrey, England. It is west of Leatherhead, on the other side of the River Mole and Mill Pond springs and the associated nature reserve. The Mill Pond springs are a large number of chalk springs, which provide much of the water supply for the surrounding area. These springs even continued to supply water during the droughts of 1976 and 2006. Although some would call it a suburb of Leatherhead, Fetcham is actually a busy village with good local shops, and has easy access to London, Guildford, Cobham, Epsom and, of course, Leatherhead. [ History ] The name Fetcham is derived from the Anglo-Saxon “Fecca’s ham” - Fecca&apos;s settlement. Fetcham lay within the Copthorne hundred, an administrative division devised by the Saxons. Indeed, there is evidence that there were even earlier settlements, with the discovery of Stone and Bronze Age tools and Roman artefacts, as well as three ancient burial grounds. Fetcham appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as Feceham. It was held partly by William the Conqueror; partly by Richard from the Bishop of Bayeux partly by Oswald the Thegn. Its Domesday assets were: 7 hides; 5½ mills worth 17s, 10½ plough s and 2 ox en, [ 30 acre m2 ] of meadow, woodland, herbage and pannage worth 23 hogs. It rendered £10 10s 0d. { Surrey Domesday Book } Fetcham, therefore, was referenced in the Domesday survey as three manors; one known as King&apos;s Manor was probably Fetcham Park; another was given to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux after the Norman conquest. The third was an Augustinian foundation from Merton Priory, at Cannon Court, which Henry VIII dissolved in 1538. Its small manorial farming community numbered 176 in the survey, but halved as a result of the Black Death in 1349. In the first half of the nineteenth century the population was still only around 370 { http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=50962#s1 }. In the 1931 census it had reached 1,318, and by 1972 was 7,331. { http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/ENG-SURREY/1999-04/0924853766 } The Fetcham Conservation Area includes the impressive 18th century mansion of Fetcham Park House. The Well House, The Dower House and Ballands Hall are three of a cluster of old buildings in the area. St Mary&apos;s Church has been a place of Christian worship for over 1000 years. Built during Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods, it is probably on the site of an even earlier timber church. There are many hints of its past in its structure. These include the south-west quoin of the nave, and a single splay window high on the south wall with traces of Roman brick as well as arches that are presumed to pre-date 1066. [ Village ] The village of Fetcham is quite large; extending from the River Mole at the village&apos;s east side, it is bounded by the neighbouring villages of Great Bookham and Little Bookham on its west. To non-residents, Fetcham is regarded as part of Leatherhead. In its postal address, Royal Mail prefer you to use the format of &quot; Fetcham, Leatherhead &quot;. The centre of the village has a number of shops, various in nature, with roadside free car parking. These are sufficient for the day-to-day demands of the local population. Food and drink is catered for by restaurants and food outlets supplying Indian, Chinese, and Italian cuisine, as well as a friendly fish and chips shop and a pleasant bakery coffee shop. A Harringtons&apos; Sandwich bistro is currently being built. There are four Christian congregations in the village: Cannon Court Evangelical Church, in Cannonside Church of the Holy Spirit ( RC ), in Bell Lane Community Church, which meets in Fetcham Infants School St Mary&apos;s Church, off The Ridgeway To its south are the Fetcham and Leatherhead Downs, which are a part of the North Downs. [ Education ] There are two village schools: Fetcham Infants School for ages 4-7 with an attached pre-school for ages 2-4 Oakfield Junior School for ages 7-11 [ Social life ] Fetcham has just one pub, The Bell. It had a major refit in late 2004 and again in late 2007 by its new owner the Youngs brewery chain. The Bell is mentioned in The Good Food Guide. The large Village Hall in The Street is home to several organisations, including Fetcham Village Women&apos;s Institute. It was also the venue for several early performances by the influential band John&apos;s Children, which included sometime frontman Marc Bolan. { John&apos;s Children official site } There is also a small reading room, in Cobham Road. There was a social club, called the Fetcham Sports and Social Club, but this closed in 2001 after the membership dwindled. The building is now used as offices. 1st Fetcham Scout Group, headquartered in Cock Lane, has two Cub Scout packs and two Scout Troops, as well as Beavers and Explorers. [ Transport ] [ Road ] The main village thoroughfare is the A245 Cobham Road. [ Rail ] There is no British Rail link to Fetcham. The nearest stations are Leatherhead, Cobham and Bookham.
