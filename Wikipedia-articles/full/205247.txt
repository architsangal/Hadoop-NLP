The son of former footballer Terry Owen, Owen began his senior career at Liverpool in 1996. He progressed through the Liverpool youth team and scored on his debut in May 1997. In his first full season in the Premier League he finished as joint top scorer with 18 goals. He repeated this the following year and was Liverpool&apos;s top goal scorer from 1997–2004, despite a recurring hamstring injury. In 2001, Liverpool won a cup treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and Football League Cup, and Owen was the recipient of the Ballon d&apos;Or. He went on to score 118 goals in 216 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool. Owen moved to Real Madrid for £8  million in mid-2004; he was frequently used as a substitute. He scored 13 goals in La Liga and had the season&apos;s highest ratio of goals scored to number of minutes played. He returned to England the following season, joining Newcastle United for £16  million. After a promising start to the 2005–06 season, injuries largely ruled him out over the next 18 months. After his return he became team captain and was the team&apos;s top scorer for the 2007–08 season. After the final season of his four-year contract, Newcastle were relegated, and Owen moved to Manchester United as a free agent. Internationally, Owen first played for the senior England team in 1998, becoming England&apos;s youngest player and youngest goalscorer at the time. His performance at the 1998 World Cup brought him to national and international prominence and he went on to score in Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. He is the only player to have scored in four major tournaments for England. He played at the 2006 World Cup but suffered an injury which took him a year to recover from. Occasionally playing as captain, he is England&apos;s seventh most-capped player and has scored a national record of 26 competitive goals, with 40 in total from 89 appearances, most recently in 2008. [ Matthias Arnhold http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/eng-recintlp.html England – Record International Players RSSSF 29 January 2009 11 February 2009 ] Owen&apos;s long injury absence after the 2006 World Cup resulted in a dispute between FIFA and The FA and Newcastle United, and eventually resulted in an unprecedented £10m compensation award to Newcastle, and brought changes to the compensation arrangements between club and country regarding injuries sustained by contracted club players while on international duty.On 17th May 2012 he was released by Manchester United as he was not offered a new contract and thus Owen is now a free agent.

Owen scored on his debut for Mold Alexandra, a 2–0 win over local rivals Bagillt. After leaving Deeside, Owen attended Hawarden High School, where he also played for the school team. [ Club career ] [ Liverpool ] { Jamie Carragher Testimonial Match (2010) } At age 12, when Owen started attending high school, he became eligible to sign a schoolboy contract with a club. He held talks with Chelsea, Málaga [ April 2012 ] and Arsenal, before he eventually signed for Liverpool (despite growing up as a supporter of their rivals Everton ). Liverpool then persuaded him to attend the FA&apos;s School of Excellence at Lilleshall in Shropshire at age 14. Throughout this time, he continued his studies and achieved ten GCSE s. [ http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/michael-owen/ Michael Owen Biography 18 December 2009 Hello Magazine ] Liverpool signed Owen after he graduated from Lilleshall at 16, and he joined the club on the Youth Training Scheme. The star of Liverpool&apos;s 1996 FA Youth Cup triumph, scoring in the final against a West Ham United team that included Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand, Owen scored prolifically as he rose rapidly through the Anfield ranks.

He scored on his Liverpool debut on 6 May 1997, the penultimate game of the Premier League season, which they lost 2–1 to Wimbledon at Selhurst Park. { http://www.lfchistory.net/Stats/Article/2561 } With an injury to Robbie Fowler, Owen was thrust immediately into action as a first team regular alongside the likes of newcomer Paul Ince and playmaker Steve McManaman in the following 1997–98 season. He scored his first European goal for the club against Celtic in the UEFA Cup and recorded his first professional hat-trick against Grimsby Town in the League Cup. His first Premier League hat-trick came later that season at Hillsborough against Sheffield Wednesday, a week after he had scored two consolation goals in Liverpool&apos;s surprise 3–2 home defeat by Southampton. { Liverpool Results 1997–98. Liverweb. Retrieved 3 May 2011. } Owen ended that season as a joint top scorer in the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers &apos; Chris Sutton and Coventry City &apos;s Dion Dublin, scoring eighteen goals, and was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year by fellow professionals. Of the three, only Owen was selected for the 1998 World Cup squad. The 1998–99 season proved to be another good season for Owen as he scored 23 Goals in 40 games for Liverpool. Despite his form, Liverpool were unable to mount a title challenge and their seventh-place finish was not enough to attain even a UEFA Cup place. Owen injured his hamstring in a league game against Leeds United on 12 April, which proved to be a recurring injury and prematurely brought his season to an end. The next season was a frustrating one for Owen as he was out for lengthy periods due to the effects of the previous season&apos;s injury, but nevertheless he managed to score 12 goals and helped Liverpool to qualify for the UEFA Cup. In the run-up to Euro 2000, Owen was still suffering hamstring problems and received treatment from the Bayern Munich doctor, Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt.

The team won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup, with Owen scoring two goals in the last few minutes against Arsenal in the FA Cup final to turn what had appeared to be a 1–0 defeat into a 2–1 victory, the game has since been christened &quot; The Michael Owen Cup Final &quot;. Winning the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup allowed Liverpool to play in the Charity Shield and the UEFA Super Cup at the beginning of the 2001–02 season. Liverpool won both matches with Owen scoring the second goal of the 2–1 win over Manchester United in the Charity Shield and the third goal in the 2001 UEFA Super Cup win over European champions Bayern Munich. Liverpool thus became the first English team to win five trophies in one calendar year. Just a week later, Owen would again beat Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, as the English international hit a hat-trick in England&apos;s 5–1 win over Germany in Munich.

He was also voted World Soccer player of the year in 2001; he is the only English player to win the award and was the first Premier League player to do so. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1715911.stm Owen&apos;s crowning glory 27 May 2007 17 December 2001 BBC Sport ] He scored his 100th goal for Liverpool on 21 December 2001 against West Ham United. Liverpool finished second in the league in the 2001–2002 season and Owen played a key part in the success, scoring 28 goals. The 2002–03 season saw Owen on top form again as he hit 28 goals. Liverpool were on top of the table and looked like genuine title contenders for the first time in several years, but a run of bad results saw them eventually finishing fifth in the table. Owen also scored at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff when Liverpool beat Manchester United 2–0 to win the League Cup and scored his 100th Premier League goal against West Bromwich Albion. In an injury-hit 2003–04 season he still managed to score 19 goals, getting his 150th goal for the club on 15 February 2004 against Portsmouth, but otherwise it was a bleak season for both him and Liverpool. Following Gérard Houllier &apos;s sacking as Liverpool manager, speculation about Owen&apos;s departure from the club began. During the first few Champions League games at the start of the 2004–2005 season, Owen sat on the bench to avoid being cup-tied for the Champions League, something that would have meant he would be unable to play in European competitions for any other club that season. Since 1998 Owen had been Liverpool&apos;s top scorer every season until he left the club.

He ended the season with thirteen goals in La Liga, with the season&apos;s highest ratio of goals scored to number of minutes played. Following Real&apos;s signing of two high-profile Brazilian forwards, Robinho and Júlio Baptista in the summer of 2005, the speculation arose that Owen would return to the Premier League.

Under the existing insurance arrangements between club and country, Fifa and the FA had been paying £50,000 of Owen&apos;s £110,000 weekly wages since he suffered the injury, totalling about £2m for the time he was out of action.
