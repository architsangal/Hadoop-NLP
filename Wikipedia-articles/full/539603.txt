[ Biography ] Bearden was born in Lexa, Arkansas. His boyhood idol was Lou Gehrig and he learned baseball on the Tennessee sandlots. In the minors, he played for manager Casey Stengel with the Oakland Acorns when the team was the property of the New York Yankees. The Yankees traded Bearden to Cleveland after the 1946 season. In 1948 Bearden was 20–7 with a league-leading 2.43 ERA, and he completed 15 of his 29 starts with six shutout s. Pitching on a staff with future Hall of Fame rs Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and Satchel Paige, Bearden emerged as the star of the Indians. Bearden&apos;s 20th victory came in a one-game playoff for the American League pennant. Picked by manager Lou Boudreau to start on only one day of rest, Bearden responded by pitching a five-hitter and leading the Indians over Ted Williams and the Boston Red Sox 8–3.

The 28-year-old lefty was at his best, shutting out the Braves on five hits in a 2–0 victory; at the plate, he contributed a double and a single. In Game 6 at Braves Field, Bearden was summoned from the bullpen to relieve Lemon in the eighth inning. Bearden got the final five outs for a save and the Indians held on for a 4–3 win that clinched the championship. Bearden&apos;s success was even more amazing considering he had pitched in only one major league game prior to 1948. The year before, he worked one-third of an inning for the Indians and allowed three earned runs, two hits and one walk, giving him an ERA of 81.00. There was just one MLB Rookie of the Year picked in the majors that season, and the award went to Alvin Dark of the Braves. Bearden, however, never came close to duplicating his rookie season. He never won more than eight games in a year after that, and twice led the AL in wild pitch es. The Indians put him on waivers during the 1950 season, and he was claimed by Washington Senators. Bearden finished with a 45–38 record, 259 strikeout s, 435 walks and a 3.96 ERA in a career that lasted until 1953. He also pitched for the Detroit Tigers, the St. Louis Browns and the Chicago White Sox. However, his &apos;48 big season was enough to make a great impression on Ted Williams, who wrote in his book My Turn At Bat, that &quot; Gene Bearden was a left-handed knuckleball pitcher who ordinarily wouldn&apos;t draw a second glance on a staff with Bob Feller, Bob Lemon, Early Wynn and Mike Garcia. Every ball he threw was either a little knuckleball or a little knuckle curve. &quot; When the Indians celebrated their 100th anniversary (2001), Bearden was selected as one of the greatest 100 players in the team&apos;s history. The choice of Bearden to pitch the playoff championship game was against tradition. The Red Sox despite Williams presence were predominantly right-handed power hitting team, and Fenway Park had a short left field (a/k/a &quot; Green Monster &quot; ) fence. Left-handed pitchers were not very successful there, so sending Bearden with a short rest, is an excellent example of Booudreau&apos;s managing skill. The two homers Lou hit were also an example of his clutch hitting ability. [ Health issues ] Gene Bearden was struck by shrapnel causing serious head injury while serving on a cruiser in WW 2. It required removal of some skull bone. He was fitted with a silver replacement for the cranial bones removed in the surgery. However, secondary to these injuries he had chronic headaches and intermittent optical incidents. They required the use of painkilling drugs and others aimed at addressing optical and balance issues. Bearden turned to ETOH to help deal with these problems. His relatively short career was as much a product of his self medication with ETOH, and the war caused traumatic injuries as any physical pitching problems. Indeed, they blighted his life for long periods although better pharmaceuticals and surgical procedures gave him greater relief from the principal symptoms later in life. Bearden&apos;s life was a casualty of the War, despite his relatively long physical presence after it. Gene Bearden died in Alexander City, Alabama, at 83 years of age.
