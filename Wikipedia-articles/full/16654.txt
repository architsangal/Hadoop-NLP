Map of Kenya, showing major lakes &amp; towns [ Kenya_sat.png Kenya ] Topography of Kenya The geography of Kenya is diverse. Kenya has a coastline on the Indian Ocean, which contains swamps of East African mangroves. Inland are broad plains and numerous hills. Central and Western Kenya is characterized by the Kenyan Rift Valley home to three of Africa&apos;s highest mountains, Mount Kenya, Mount Elgon and Kilimanjaro. The Kakamega Forest in western Kenya is relic of an East African rainforest. Much larger is Mau Forest, the largest forest complex in East Africa.

The rift runs north–south from Lake Turkana in the north south past Mount Kenya and Lake Magadi and on to Lake Natron and Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Much of the western two-thirds of the country underlying the Pliocene – Pleistocene volcanics consist of Precambrian basement rocks. { Petroleum Potential of NW-Kenya Rift Basins: A Synopsis of Evidence and Issues } The southeast corner of the country is underlain by sediments of the Karoo System of Permian to Late Triassic age and a strip of Jurassic age sediments along the coast in the Mombasa area. The Anza trough is a NW–SE trending Jurassic rift extending from the Indian Ocean coast to the Sudan northwest of Lake Turkana. The Anza Rift resulted from the break–up of Gondwana.

The climate along the coast is tropical. This means rainfall and temperatures are higher throughout the year. At the coastal city Mombasa, the air changes from cool to hot, almost every day (see chart below). The further inside Kenya, the more arid the climate becomes. An arid climate is nearly devoid of rainfall, and temperature swings widely according to the general time of the day/night. For many areas of Kenya, the daytime temperature rises about [ 12 C F 1 ], almost every day. Elevation is the major factor in temperature levels, with the higher areas, on average, as 11°C (20°F) cooler, day or night. { &quot; NairobiDagoretti, Kenya: Climate, Global Warming, and } { Daylight Charts and Data &quot;, Climate-Charts.com, 2008, web: } { CC741 : } { compare } { Nairobi / } { Dagoretti data with the } { Kitale } { or } { Mombasa charts. } { &quot; Kitale, Kenya: Climate, Global Warming, and Daylight } { Charts and Data &quot;, Climate-Charts.com, 2008, web: } { CC661. } The many mile-high cities have temperature swings from roughly [ 50 - 79 F C 1 ]. Nairobi, at [ 1798 m ft 0 on ] or [ 1.798 km mi 2 on ], ranges from [ 49 - 80 F C 1 ], and Kitale, at [ 1825 m ft 0 on ] or [ 1.825 km mi 2 on ], ranges from [ 51 - 82 F C 1 ]. The overnight lows are not like the &quot; Garden of Eden &quot; because, at night, heavy clothes or blankets are needed, in the highlands, when the temperature drops to about [ 50 - 54 F C 1 ] every night. At lower altitudes, the increased temperature is like day and night, literally: like starting the morning at the highland daytime high, and then adding the heat of the day, again. Hence, the overnight low temperatures near sealevel are nearly the same as the high temperatures of the elevated Kenyan highlands. However, locations along the Indian Ocean have more moderate temperatures, as a few degrees cooler in the daytime, such as at Mombasa (see chart below). There are slight seasonal variations in temperature, of [ 4 C-change or ], cooler in the winter months. Although Kenya is centered at the equator, it shares the seasons of the southern hemisphere : with the warmest summer months in February-March and the coolest winter months in July-August, although only a few degrees cooler. On the high mountains, such as Mount Kenya, Mount Elgon and Kilimanjaro, the weather can become bitterly cold for most of the year. Some snowfall has occurred on the highest mountains.

[ Elevation extremes ] The lowest point on Kenya is at sea level on the Indian Ocean. The highest point on Kenya is 5,199 meters above sea level at Mount Kenya. [ Rivers ] The two main rivers are the Galana and the Tana. However, the Ewaso Ng&apos;iro is a very important river supplying water from Mt. Kenya to the northern part of Kenya. [ Natural resources ] Natural resources that are found on Kenya include limestone, soda ash, salt, gemstones, fluorspar, zinc, diatomite, gypsum, wildlife and hydropower. [ Land use ] 8.01% of the land is arable. Permanent crops occupy 0.97% of the land. Other uses make up the rest of Kenya&apos;s land. (2005) [ Irrigated land ] 1030 km² of Kenya&apos; land is irrigated.(2010) [ Natural hazards ] Natural hazards include recurring drought and flooding during the rainy seasons. [ The Environmental issues ] [ Current issues ] Current issues that threaten the environment at the moment include water pollution from urban and industrial wastes; degradation of water quality from the increased use of pesticides and fertilizers; deforestation; soil erosion; desertification and poaching.
