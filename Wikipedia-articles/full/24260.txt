Musharraf headed and led an administrative military government from October 1999 till August 2007. He ruled Pakistan as Chief Executive from 1999 to 2001 and as President from 2001 to 2008. Facing impeachment, he preferred to resign on 18 August 2008. After years of military service, he rose to prominence when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif appointed him as the Chief of Army Staff in October 1998. Musharraf was the mastermind behind the controversial and internationally condemned Kargil infiltration, which derailed peace negotiations with Pakistan&apos;s long standing enemy India. He previously also played a vital role in the Afghanistan civil war (1996–2001) both in peace negotiations and in trying to end the bloodshed. After months of contentious relations with Sharif, Musharraf was brought to power through a bloodless military coup. Subsequently Nawaz Sharif was placed under a house-arrest, later shifting him to Adiala Jail. As Pakistan&apos;s head of state, he was a U.S. ally in the War on Terror. He was credited with the development of Pakistan&apos;s economy during the early years of his rule. He is also credited to be the first president of Pakistan who accepted supreme court rulings and who organized free and fair elections. The last two years of his rule were marred by controversies, including the suspension of the Supreme Court Chief Justice and the Lal Masjid siege. Ian Kershaw, a professor of modern history at Sheffield University, described Musharraf as Pakistan&apos;s Paul von Hindenburg.

First officer being lieutenant-general Ali Kuli Khan, a graduate of PMA and RMA, Sandhurst. Lieutenant-general Ali Kuli Khan was an extremely capable staff officer and had prestige in the public circles, but was close to former chief of army staff general (retired) Abdul Vaheed; therefore he was ignored for the promotion. Second in line was lieutenant-general Khalid Nawaz Khan who was popularly knew for his ruthless leadership in the army; unforgiven to his junior subordinated officers if failing to meet task. Lieutenant-general Nawaz Khan was knew in public for his opposition and anti-muhajir sentiment, particularly his hardline against the MQM. Musharraf was in third-in line, and had a good reputation in public circles, armed forces and high academic standings in his college and university studies. Musharraf had a good image in Prime minister&apos;s circles and a straight officer with democratic views. Nisar Ali Khan and Shahbaz Sharif recommended Musharraf during the meeting and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif personally promoted Musharraf as four-star general to replace Karamat. Musharraf superseded Lieutenant General Khalid Nawaz Khan and Lieutenant-General Ali Kuli Khan Khattak who were much senior to him. After the Kargil, Musharraf did not wished to be the Chairman Joint Chiefs but, in clear terms, he mentioned to Shahbaz Sharif that he would not agree to relieved from the post of chief of army staff and promoted to chairman joint chiefs before his term was up. Musharraf favored the chief of naval staff Admiral Bokhari to be elevated as chairman joint chiefs, and claimed that: &quot; he did not care &quot; Prime minister was already facing cold war with the Admiral in sometime between 1999 and Musharraf cemented problems with Nawaz Sharif after recommending the force retirement of senior officer close to the Prime minister. Lieutenant-General Tariq Pervez (or TP) was a corps commander of XII Corps, who was a brother-in-law of Prime minister&apos;s one of high profile cabinet minister. According to Musharraf, lieutenant-general TP was an ill-mannered, foul-mouth, ill-disciplined officer and was responsible to cause dissension in the armed forces, an information Musharraf reported claimed to have credible and authentic. In a dinner with Admiral Bokhari, Nawaz Sharif announced to promote General Musharraf as chairman joint chiefs while willingly approved the retirement papers of TP. When Admiral Bokhari heard the news, a strong and powerful protest was launched against the Prime minister and the silent cold war with the admiral came to end with Prime minister approving the relieving papers of Admiral Bokhari the next morning. [ Kargil Conflict ] [ Kargil Conflict ] The Pakistan Army originally conceived the Kargil plan after the Siachen conflict but the plan was rebuffed repeatedly by senior civilian and military officials. Musharraf was a leading strategist behind the Kargil Conflict. From March to May 1999, he ordered the secret infiltration of Kashmiri forces in the Kargil district. After India discovered the infiltration, a fierce Indian offensive nearly led to a full-scale war. However, Sharif withdrew support of the insurgents in the border conflict in July because of heightened international pressure.

Musharraf succeeded to pass the XVII amendment which grants powers to dissolve the parliament however approval requires from the Supreme Court. Within two years, Jamali proved to be an ineffective prime minister to forcefully implement his policies in the country and mounted problems with elite business class of Pakistan. Musharraf accepted the resignation of Jamali and asked his close colleague Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain to appoint a new prime minister in place. Hussain nominated Finance minister Shaukat Aziz, who had been impressive due to his performance as finance minister in 1999. Musharraf regarded Aziz as his right hand and preferable choice for the office of Prime minister. With Aziz appointed as Prime minister, Musharraf transferred all executive powers to Aziz as he eye-blindly trusted Shaukat Aziz. Aziz proved to be extremely capable while running the government and under Aziz&apos;s government economic growth reached to a maximum level which further stabilized Musharraf&apos;s presidency.

During this sting operation, it was revealed that Mahmood had a meeting with Osama bin Laden to build a radiological weapon. But, Mahmood was not capable of developing the weapon as he was an expert in nuclear power technology, not weapons. Therefore, Al-Qaeda was unable to gain any knowledge from these scientists, the ISI and CIA later reported. Musharraf, who during this time was Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, decided to militarily debrief the scientists. Mahmood and Dr. Majeed were taken into the custody of the Judge Advocate General Branch (JAG) where the debriefings continued until the early 2005. After the debriefings were completed, both scientists were put out of public eye and were prevented from attending any science seminars held in the country. As President, General Musharraf had promoted Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan to the most prestigious post, the Science Advisor to the President. Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan&apos;s open-promotion of nuclear weapons and ballistics missiles brought an international embarrassment for Pakistan. According to Zahid Malik, after the government received potential and solid evidence against Khan from the United States, General Musharraf and the military establishment were in full mood to exercise rough actions against Khan. Khan&apos;s debriefing was necessary for General Musharraf to prove the loyalty of Pakistan to the United States and Western world. One of the most widely-reported controversies during Musharraf&apos;s administration arose as a consequence of the disclosure of nuclear proliferation by Dr. A.Q. Khan, a pakistani national hero and one of the most decorated scientists. Initially General Musharraf denied knowledge of or participation by Pakistan or the Pakistan Army, Pakistan Air Force and even the Pakistan Navy, despite Khan urging that Musharraf was the leader of the proliferation ring. On January 2004, General Musharraf dismissed Dr. A.Q. Khan as his Science Adviser. A formal military debriefing of Khan continued for the next three years. Musharraf faced bitter domestic criticism for singularly attempting to vilify Khan. Musharraf&apos;s long standing ally MQM gave a cold shoulder and bitter and acrimonious criticism to Musharraf over his handling of Khan. MQM tapped an anti-Musharraf movement for the release of Khan which initially shocked Musharraf and the United States. MQM and her leaders threatened to leave Musharraf&apos;s government if Khan was persecuted or even jailed. Fearing his regime would be topple if MQM continued to tap this wave, Khan was pardoned in exchange for cooperation in the investigation by Musharraf, but was put under house arrest where he was forced to attend various debriefings which would continue for hours.

[ Domestic politics ] In December 2003, Musharraf made a deal with Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a six-member coalition of Islam ic parties, agreeing to leave the army by 31 December 2004. With that party&apos;s support, pro-Musharraf legislators were able to muster the two-thirds supermajority required to pass the Seventeenth Amendment, which retroactively legalized Musharraf&apos;s 1999 coup and many of his decrees. In late 2004, Musharraf went back on his agreement with the MMA and pro-Musharraf legislators in the Parliament passed a bill allowing Musharraf to keep both offices. Constitution Article 63 clause (1) paragraph (d), read with proviso to Article 41 clause (7) paragraph (b), allows the President to hold dual office. On 1 January 2004, Musharraf had won a confidence vote in the Electoral College of Pakistan, consisting of both houses of Parliament and the four provincial assemblies. Musharraf received 658 out of 1170 votes, a 56% majority, but many opposition and Islamic members of parliament walked out to protest the vote. As a result of this vote, his term was extended to 2007. Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali resigned on 26 June 2004, after losing the support of the PML(Q). His resignation was at least partially due to his public differences with the party chairman, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain. This was rumored to have happened at Musharraf&apos;s command. Jamali had been appointed with the support of Musharraf&apos;s and the pro-Musharraf PML(Q). Most PML(Q) parliamentarians formerly belonged to the Pakistan Muslim League party led by Sharif, and most ministers of the cabinet were formerly senior members of other parties, joining the PML(Q) after the elections upon being offered positions. Musharraf nominated Shaukat Aziz, the minister for finance and a former employee of Citibank { Citigroup (NYSE:CCI) Global Consumer Business Announces Management Structure, October 13, 1998 } and head of Citibank Private Banking as the new prime minister.
