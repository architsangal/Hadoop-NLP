[ History ] [ April 2012 ] Deerfield was originally part of Nottingham. In 1756, residents petitioned for organization of a separate parish, but were denied. In 1765, while a second petition was pending, two local hunters presented Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth with a deer. Permission was granted, and &quot; Deerfield &quot; was incorporated in 1766. The incorporation act for Deerfield was signed by three members of the Leavitt family, including Capt. Samuel who later served as one of the town&apos;s first selectmen. Leavitts Hill in Deerfield was named for the family, who first settled in nearby Exeter. { History of Deerfield, History of Rockingham and Strafford Counties, D. Hamilton Hurd, 1882 } { Genealogical and Family History of the State of New Hampshire, Ezra Scollay Stearns, 1908 } &quot; Deerfield Parade &quot;, a hilltop district first settled about 1740, was located on the early postal route between Concord and Portsmouth. Here, the militia of the Revolutionary and Civil wars trained and &quot; paraded &quot; on the village common. The &quot; Parade &quot; was then a professional, cultural and trade center. About 1798, citizens founded Deerfield Academy, a high school. Unfortunately, it burned in 1842. Once a thriving farm community which was disappointed when bypassed by railroad s, the town in 1876 established the Deerfield Fair. Now billed as &quot; New England&apos;s Oldest Family Fair &quot;, the four-day event draws huge crowds each autumn to admire animals, produce and crafts, or enjoy amusement park rides.
