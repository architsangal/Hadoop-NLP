It consists of four globular clusters, the main cluster being discovered in 1994. Sag DEG is roughly 10,000 light-year s in diameter, and is currently about 70,000 light-years from Earth, travelling in a polar orbit at a distance of about 50,000 light-years from the core of the Milky Way (about 1/3 the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud ). It should not be confused with the Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy, or the Sag DIG, a small galaxy 3.4 million light-years distant. [ Features ] Officially discovered in 1994, by Rodrigo Ibata, Mike Irwin, and Gerry Gilmore, Sag DEG was immediately recognized as being the nearest known neighbor to our Milky Way at the time. (Since 2003, the newly discovered Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is considered the actual nearest neighbor). Although it is one of the closest companion galaxies to the Milky Way, the main parent cluster is on the opposite side of the galactic core from Earth, and consequently is very faint, although it covers a large area of the sky. Sag DEG appears to be an older galaxy, with little interstellar dust and composed largely of Population II stars, older and metal-poor, as compared to the Milky Way. No neutral hydrogen gas related to Sag DEG was found by Burton &amp; Lockman in 1999.

In 2003 with the aid of infrared telescopes and super computers, Steven Majewski, Michael Skrutskie, and Martin Weinberg were able to help create a new star map, picking out the full Sagittarius Dwarf presence, position, and looping shape from the mass of background stars and finding this smaller galaxy to be at a near right angle to the plane of the Milky Way. { http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~mfs4n/sgr/sgr_big.jpg } [ Globular clusters ] [[Image:Messier 54.png|right|thumb|180px|| Messier 54, believed to be at the core of Sag DEG.Greyscale image created from the HST&apos;s Advanced Camera for Surveys ]] { Palomar 12, believed to have been captured from the Sag DEG about 1.7 } { Gya } Sag DEG has four known globular clusters with one, M54, apparently residing at its core. It is also dynamically linked to the &quot; young &quot; globular Terzan 7 as well as to Terzan 8 and Arp 2. [ Sbordone L. Bonifacio P. Marconi G. Buonanno R. Zaggia S.

It also exhibits an age-metallicity relationship, in that itsold populations are metal poor ([Fe/H]=-1.6 ± 0.1) while its youngest populations have super-solar abundances. [ Siegel Michael et al.

Anderson Jay Marín-Franch Antonio Rosenberg Alfred ] [ Geometry and dynamics ] Based on its current trajectory, the Sag DEG main cluster is about to pass through the galactic disc of the Milky Way within the next hundred million years, while the extended loop-shaped ellipse is already extended around and through our local space and on through the Milky Way galactic disc, and in the process of slowly being absorbed into the larger galaxy, calculated at 10,000 times the mass of Sag DEG. At first, many astronomers thought that Sag DEG had already reached an advanced state of destruction, so that a large part of its original matter was already mixed with that of the Milky Way. However, Sag DEG still has coherence as a dispersed elongated ellipse, and appears to move in a roughly polar orbit around the Milky Way as close as 50,000 light-years from the galactic core. Although it may have begun as a ball of stars before falling towards the Milky Way, Sag DEG is now being torn apart by immense tidal forces over hundreds of millions of years. Numerical simulations suggest that stars ripped out from the dwarf would be spread out in a long stellar stream along its path, which were subsequently detected. However, some astronomers contend that Sag DEG has been in orbit around the Milky Way for some billions of years, and has already orbited it approximately ten times. Its ability to retain some coherence despite such strains would indicate an unusually high concentration of dark matter within that galaxy. In 1999, Johnston et al. concluded that Sag DEG has orbited the Milky Way for at least one Gya and that during that time its mass has decreased by a factor of two or three. Its orbit is found to have galactocentric distance s that oscillate between ~13 and ~41 kpc with a period of 550 to 750 million years. The last perigalacticon was approximately fifty million years ago. Also in 1999, Jiang &amp; Binney found that it may have started its infall into the Milky Way at a point more than 200 kpc away if its starting mass was as large as ~10 11 M ☉. The models of both its orbit and the Milky Way&apos;s potential field could be improved by proper-motion observations of Sag DEG&apos;s stellar debris. This issue is under intense investigation, with computational support by the MilkyWay@Home project.
