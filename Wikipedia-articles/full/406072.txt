Since 1995, Hamilton has written and played the lead role of Satan in the Radio 4 sitcom Old Harry&apos;s Game. He toured with his UK stand-up show Hat of Doom in 2008 in which he famously wore a large shiny top hat for portions of the show which he pretended to believe rendered him invisible. In 2009, Hamilton presented the BBC Four series It&apos;s Only a Theory with Reginald D. Hunter. [ Personal life ] He is married to Libby Asher, with whom he has three children  – Pip, Slobbie, and Isobel  – and lives in Wimbledon, London. On The News Quiz 25th Anniversary Special, he remarked many had noticed the likeness between him and a certain Italian opera singer: &quot; I&apos;ve often been compared to Pavarotti.
