[ History ] Slayden&apos;s growth was spurred by the existence of a railroad line (the &quot; Mineral Branch &quot; of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad ) which was built in the late 19th century largely to assist the movement of iron from the nearby works at Cumberland Furnace to market. In the early 20th century Slayden was home to a department store and was considered a major community of Dickson County. With the closure of the Mineral Branch and the Cumberland Furnace works, the area went into an economic decline. As the area declined from the loss of the furnace works, nearby Nashville and Clarksville TN offered more non-farming opportunities. The local primary school was closed in 1960, merged with the larger one in nearby Vanleer. At about this time mail ceased to be delivered from the post office. In the 1980 census, Slayden had only 69 inhabitants and was known for the next decade as Tennessee&apos;s smallest incorporated town. In the 1980s the former railroad depot was removed to Hickman County, Tennessee to become an attraction at a proposed amusement park that never actually came into operation. The voting precinct in the area was abolished after the 2000 elections and split between those in Vanleer and Cumberland Furnace. In 2003 the town&apos;s future as an incorporated community seemed endangered when only six voters (out of 127 registered) participated in a municipal election and only two candidates qualified for the four unpaid positions on the Board of Mayor and Aldermen. This was prevented when the vacancies were filled by persons who had received write-in votes; participation in the 2005 municipal elections was considerably higher. The Slayden family appears in census for Dickson co TN in 1820, 1830 and 1840, by which time there were four Slayden heads of household, all being descended from brothers Daniel Everett Slayden and William Everett Slayden. Both lines produced a prodigious number of military officerss, medical doctors or dentists. One son of Daniel Everett Slayden was Hartwell Marable Slayden b ca 1806, who had three sons who were medical doctors: William Marshall Slayden, John Dann Slayden and Hartwell Marable Slayden Jr. All three sons of Hartwell M are in the 1850 Dickson TN census, along with one of the patriarchs &quot; William Everette Slayden &quot; listed as a &quot; waggonmaker &quot; born 1788 in VA, and four other heads of households. The name of the community probably reflects the land ownership (possibly plantations) of this family, as the 1860 census reveals 35 &quot; white &quot; members of this extended family and there are also slaves on the 1860 Slave Schedules. Alternatively, it could reflect the service of the three physicians to the community. The Slayden Cemetery (sometimes called Guerin Cemetery, an allied family) holds many members of this family. The name continued into the 1930 census. Most other lines of this family (cousinage proven by DNA) now use SLAYTON or SLATON as name spelling, though a few SLAYDENs are still found in parts of Tennessee and Florida.
