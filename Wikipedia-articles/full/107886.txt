[ Northern pike ] In 1996-97 Lake Davis was in the national spotlight for the controversy of the Northern Pike and the possibility of poisoning the lake. There was an explosion of the pike population, and the CA Department of Fish and Game decided to poison the lake with rotenone. { http://www.dfg.ca.gov/lakedavis/history.html } In September 2007 the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) attempted to eradicate Northern pike in Lake Davis by lowering the lake and poisoning the remaining waters with Rotenone, a naturally occurring poison deadly to gilled creatures. [ Tamara Keith California Poisons Lake, Targeting Invasive Pike http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId%3D14698649%26amp%3Bft%3D1%26amp%3Bf%3D1001 All Things Considered National Public Radio 2007-09-25 2007-09-25 ] California DFG fears, perhaps unfairly, that pike may escape the lake and enter the Sacramento River system, posing a potential threat to native anadromous fish species that are already threatened, such as steelhead and salmon.The effort was extremely controversial because pike are very popular gamefish in other areas of the country and with many locals. Also, much money and effort had already been used to try and rid the lake of pike, through explosives, nets, shocking, and a previous poisoning attempt, all of which were unsuccessful. Late in 2009, reports of pike showing up in angler catches began again, indicating another failed attempt.
