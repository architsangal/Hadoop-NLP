[ Album information ] { Hammersmith Apollo on } { Money Can&apos;t Buy. } Body Language is Minogue&apos;s ninth studio album, and her third for the Parlophone label. Its title is a reference to a line in the album&apos;s lead single, &quot; Slow &quot;. The album was recorded throughout the summer of 2003 in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain. It also saw Minogue working with previous collaborators Richard Stannard, Julian Gallagher, Cathy Dennis, Johnny Douglas and Karen Poole, as well as Emiliana Torrini and Dan Carey, known collectively as Sunnyroads. The album was supported by a spectacular one-off album launch show entitled Money Can&apos;t Buy on 15 November 2003 at London&apos;s Hammersmith Apollo. At the show Minogue performed seven new songs, alongside some of her older hits. In July 2004 the concert was released on DVD, which included an unedited version of the concert as well as multi-angle screen visuals for the performances of &quot; Slow &quot; and &quot; Chocolate &quot;, a behind-the-scenes documentary and the videos for each of the singles. Australian and Japanese versions of the album included the bonus song &quot; Slo Motion &quot;. Japan also received a second bonus track, &quot; You Make Me Feel &quot;. When released in 2004, the North American version of the album included an enhanced data track with the &quot; Slow &quot; music video and the &quot; Can&apos;t Get You Out of My Head &quot; live performance from the Money Can&apos;t Buy concert as well as two bonus tracks, &quot; Cruise Control &quot; and &quot; You Make Me Feel &quot;. In the US, some versions of the album came packaged with six postcards. The album peaked at number forty-two on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200 chart and to date has sold 177,000 copies.
