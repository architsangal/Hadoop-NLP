[ Early years and youth ] Street sign on Isabel la Negra Street in Barrio San Antón Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer was born in barrio San Anton, Ponce, Puerto Rico { José Ángel Cangiano. Receso del tribunal: vivencias judiciales. Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic: Editoria Centenario. 2007. Page 3. } on 23 July 1901. Apart from her business as a madam, well documented in many Puerto Rican newspapers such as El Dia and El Vocero, not much is known about her life. The most widely accepted [ February 2012 ] legend is that Isabel left home as a young teenager to live with a wealthy man, only to find out that he was married. { &apos;&apos;Listening to salsa: gender, Latin popular music, and Puerto Rican cultures.&apos;&apos; Frances R. Aparicio. Page 52. } She then dated, and married, a much older man, a wealthy American. { &apos;&apos;Se Resolvio el Caso de &quot; Isable La Negra &quot; !&apos;&apos; 25 August 2006.&apos;&apos; Maria Elena Salinas.

Her bordello was allegedly visited by politicians, businessmen, clergy members, etc. but this remains conjecture. { &apos;&apos;Listening to salsa: gender, Latin popular music, and Puerto Rican cultures.&apos;&apos; Frances R.

Isabel had two brothels: one in Barrio San Anton and another one in Barrio Maraguez. { &apos;&apos;Listening to salsa: gender, Latin popular music, and Puerto Rican cultures.&apos;&apos; Frances R.
