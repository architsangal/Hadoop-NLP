Its center is the city of Zadar. [ Population ] According to the 2001 census, Zadar County has population of 162,045. Croats make up the majority with 93.30% of the population, while Serbs, Bosniaks, Albanians and Italians form the remainder. { POPULATION BY ETHNICITY, BY TOWNS/MUNICIPALITIES, CENSUS 2001 - REPUBLIC OF CROATIA - CENTRAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS } [ Geography ] Among the largest towns in the county of Zadar are: Zadar, Benkovac, Bibinje, Biograd, Nin, Obrovac and Pag. The county of Zadar includes the islands of Dugi otok, Ugljan, Pašman and most of Pag, as well as a number of other, smaller islands. It also features the Paklenica national park. The county&apos;s area is 7,854  km 2, 3,642  km 2 is land, which accounts for 6.4 % of the territory of Croatia. The sea area of the County is 3,632  km 2 (around 12% of the territorial waters) and the insular area is 580  km 2, with more than 300 smaller and larger islands (Zadar archipelago). The length of its coastline (including the islands) is 1,300  km. {. } The county&apos;s population is 200,936 (accounting for 4.5 % of the total Croatia&apos;s population), of which 129,000 people live in the coastal area, 21,000 on islands and 50,000 in the County&apos;s inland. [ Infrastructure ] The County of Zadar plays a leading role in road and railway traffic links between northern and southern Croatia. The main road along the Adriatic Sea passes through the county, as does the new Zagreb-Dubrovnik highway, completed as far as Split in 2005. The Zagreb- Knin -Split railway line with branch-lines to Zadar and Šibenik pass through the County. Maritime traffic is carried by the coastal route of the Adriatic Sea, by the Zadar- Ancona international car ferry route which is the shortest link between Central Europe and Italy, via Zagreb and Zadar to Rome and southward. Another route by which intensive traffic is carried is Zadar - Maslenica Bridge - St. Rok Tunnel - Zagreb. The Zadar Airport has recently been reconstructed and modernised. With runway improvements still to be undertaken it will eventually have the capacity to handle jumbo-jets. There is also a very frequent maritime passenger port in the town of Zadar and the cargo maritime port in the Gazenica area whose current manipulative capacity amounts to one million tonnes per year. A construction of a wharf would raise this significantly. The port&apos;s manipulative and warehouse capacities are used only in part. [ Economy ] The Ravni Kotari area constitutes the greater part of the County&apos;s inland, containing most of the cultivated farmland and towns having industry, crafts, trade and traffic development potential. Tourism is one of the County&apos;s most important industries, owing to its geographical position, mild climate, indented coast, clear sea, numerous bays, inlets and beaches on 1,300  km of the sea coast and islands. Tourist amenities of the Zadar County are also the areas of outstanding natural beauty: the Velebit, Telaščica and Paklenica and adjacent Krka and Kornati national parks in the south and the Plitvice Lakes national park in the north.
