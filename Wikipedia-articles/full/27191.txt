This article is about the demographic features of Saint Helena, an island and British overseas territory in the south Atlantic Ocean. St Helena is the most populous part of the wider territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. The language spoken in St Helena is English. The island has a small population of a few thousand inhabitants, mainly descended from British settlers, East India Company employees and indentured labourers from the South Asian sub-Continent, East Indies, Madagascar and China. { Official Tourism Site linked from official Government of St Helena website } A census in February 2008 recorded a population of 4,255 on the island. This compares with a figure of 5,157 recorded in 1998. The fall can be explained mostly by emigration, especially since 2002 when the islanders were granted full British citizenship. The main diaspora s are to the United Kingdom, South Africa and more recently to the Falkland Islands, as well as on Ascension Island. The population density, based on the 2008 figure, is 35 persons per km 2, or 90.6 per sq mile.
