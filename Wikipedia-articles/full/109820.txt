As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the city had a population of 61,005. It is a principal city of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which was home to 494,593 people in 2010. Daytona Beach is also a principal city of the Fun Coast region of Florida. The city is historically known as having a beach where the hard packed sand allows motorized vehicles to drive on the beach in restricted areas. { Daytona Beach Guide Overview } This hard packed sand made Daytona Beach a mecca for motorsports, with the old Daytona Beach Road Course having hosted races for over 50 years. This course was replaced in 1959 by the Daytona International Speedway. The city is also the headquarters for NASCAR and the Grand American Road Racing Association. Daytona Beach is a year-round family-friendly resort area which hosts large groups of out-of-towners that descend upon the city for various events, most notably Speedweeks in early February when over 200,000 NASCAR fans come to attend the season-opening Daytona 500. Other events include the NASCAR Coke Zero 400 race in July, Bike Week in early March, Biketoberfest in late October, and the Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona endurance race in January. [ History ] A palisaded Timucua village The area where Daytona Beach is today was once inhabited by the indigenous, Timucuan Indians, who lived in fortified villages. The Timucuas were nearly exterminated by contact with Europeans through war, enslavement and disease and became extinct as a racial entity through assimilation and attrition during the 18th century. The Seminole Indians, descendants of Creek Indians from Georgia and Alabama frequented the area prior to the Second Seminole War. During the era of British rule of Florida between 1763–1783, the King&apos;s Road passed through present day Daytona Beach. The road extended from St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, to Andrew Turnbull&apos;s experimental colony in New Smyrna. In 1804 Samuel Williams received a land grant of [ 3000 acre km2 ] from the Spanish Crown which had regained Florida from the British after the American Revolution. This land grant encompassed the area that would become Daytona Beach. Williams built a slave labor based plantation to grow cotton, rice and sugar cane. His son Samuel Hill Williams would abandon the planatation during the Second Seminole War when the Seminoles burned it to the ground. In 1871, Mathias Day, Jr., from Mansfield, Ohio, purchased a 2.144.5 acre tract of the former William&apos;s Plantation, on the west bank of the tidal channel known as the Halifax River. He built a hotel around which the town arose, which is today the Daytona Beach Historic District. In 1872 due to financial troubles he lost title to his land, residents decide to name the city Daytona in honor of Day as its founder, and incorporated the town in 1876. { Historic Daytona Beach By Harold D. Cardwell, Priscilla D. Cardwell. p. 7 Publisher: Arcadia Publishing (August 25, 2004)Language: English ISBN 0-7385-1675-9 } In 1886, the St. Johns &amp; Halifax River Railway arrived in Daytona. The line would be purchased in 1889 by Henry M. Flagler, who made it part of his Florida East Coast Railway. The separate towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach, Kingston, and Seabreeze merged as &quot; Daytona Beach &quot; in 1926, at the urging of civic leader J.B. Kahn and others. By the 1920s, it was dubbed &quot; The World&apos;s Most Famous Beach &quot;. Daytona&apos;s wide beach of smooth, compacted sand attracted automobile and motorcycle races beginning in 1902, as pioneers in the industry tested their inventions. On March 8, 1936, the first stock car race was held on the Daytona Beach Road Course. In 1959, William France Sr. and NASCAR created the Daytona International Speedway to replace the beach course. Automobiles are still permitted on most areas of the beach, at a maximum speed of [ 10 mi/h km/h on ]. Daytona Beach at dawn looking south. [ Special Events ] Practice Laps for Daytona 500 (2004) The city attracts over 8,000,000 tourists each year. It is one of the few places in the world where it is permitted for one to drive a car on the ocean beach. During motorcycle events ( Bike Week and Biketoberfest), several hundred thousand bikers from all over the world visit the greater Daytona Beach area. While the city is often associated with spring break, the efforts of the local government to discourage rowdiness, combined with the rise of other spring break destinations, have nearly ended Daytona&apos;s former preeminence as a spring break destination. Special events that draw visitors to Daytona Beach include: Speedweeks ( Daytona 500 NASCAR race, Rolex 24 sports car race, and others) Coke Zero 400, NASCAR race on the first Saturday of July (Traditionally called the Pepsi 400 or Firecracker 400) Daytona Beach Bike Week Daytona 200 motorcycle races, bike shows and biker reunion in March Biketoberfest in October Turkey Run car show and events during Thanksgiving weekend (Traditionally called the Turkey Rod Run) Spring break (date varies, usually the first and second week of March) Daytona Beach is also home to the headquarters of NASCAR, Grand-Am, International Speedway Corporation, United States Tennis Association in Florida, and the LPGA.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 64.93 sqmi 0 on ]. of which [ 58.68 sqmi 0 on ] is land and [ 6.25 sqmi 0 on ] is water. Water is 9.6% of the total area. The city of Daytona Beach is split in two by the Halifax River lagoon, part of the Intracoastal Waterway, and sits on the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered on the north by Holly Hill and Ormond Beach and on the south by Daytona Beach Shores, South Daytona and Port Orange. Daytona Beach has a humid subtropical climate, typical of the southeastern United States. Summers are hot and humid with highs usually in the 90s and a heat index often exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Thunderstorms are frequent on summer afternoons and the hot, humid weather can last right through the fall months. Winters are dry and mild, marked by a constant series of cold front s and warm-ups. Temperatures dip into the low 30s and upper 20s Fahrenheit on rare occasion, and freezes are not common. Frost occurs a few times a year mainly in the inland areas, but is rare along the beaches; snowfall is extremely rare. Temperatures in spring are famously pleasant with warm afternoons, cool evenings, and far less humidity. This beach-going weather attracts tourists back to the beaches usually by early March. Despite its warm location, there were a few catastrophic freezes in the area&apos;s history. Early settlers only left vague records, but severe freezes were indicated on: January 2–3, 1766; February 7–8, 1835; and January 16, 1857. The cold weather was so severe that crops such as orange trees were killed and several plantation owners abandoned the area as a result. { Florida Citrus Mutual: &apos;&apos;Timeline of Florida Freezes&apos;&apos; } { Monthly Weather Review, September 1895: &apos;&apos;Florida Freezes for a Century and a Half&apos;&apos; } [ http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo%3Dmlb NowData  — NOAA Online Weather Data National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2012-02-14 ] { February 2012 } [ Hurricanes and tropical storms ] Hurricane Charley, Crossed Florida and left land near Daytona Beach on Aug. 13, 2004 Summary report on building performance: 2004 hurricane season By United States. Federal Emergency Management Agency p.6 Because of Daytona Beach&apos;s proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the city has a significant chance of receiving hurricanes and tropical storms every hurricane season. However, prior to 2004, major hurricanes are only recorded as skirting by the coast of Daytona Beach without any direct hits. Hurricane Floyd passed along the Florida coast in September 1999, which caused significant beach erosion and collapsed about [ 200 ft m on ]. section of the Daytona Beach Pier. The 2004 Hurricane season was particularly tumultuous in the Daytona Beach area. Hurricane Charley was a very fast-moving, compact storm, which made landfall near Port Charlotte, Florida on the Gulf Coast of Florida, on August 13, swept northeast across the state, and hit Daytona Beach from the inland side before reentering the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricane Frances was a very large storm in size, which moved made landfall at Hutchinson Island South, Florida (near Port St. Lucie, Florida ) in the early hours of September 5, and caused a significant amount of collateral damage. Portions of Daytona Beach were without electricity or phone service for ten days following Frances due to downed lines or shorted transformers. Just three weeks later, Hurricane Jeanne formed in the Atlantic Ocean and made landfall only six miles from the same spot Frances hit, at Hutchinson Island South, Florida, on September 26. Following the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, the names Charley, Frances, and Jeanne were all retired from use. [ Tornadoes ] Daytona Beach is not immune to the threat of tornado es. Historical tornado activity is about 33% above the national average. On February 22, 1998 a tornado killed 3 people, injured 70 people, and caused $31 million in damages. Tornadoes also hit the city on Christmas Day, 2006. Some people were injured, but no fatalities were reported. Very significant damage was done to Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University &apos;s campus as the F2 tornado that touched down in Daytona Beach cut through the heart of the campus. It destroyed 50 of the school&apos;s 75 aircraft, mostly Cessna s. There were no fatalities or injuries.

The wave&apos;s range was from Ormond Beach in the north, to New Smyrna Beach on the south. The crest was [ 9 ft m ] high and centered at Daytona Beach. Sailboats crashed ashore onto cars and many people suffered cuts and bruises from glass and debris. Two people required hospitalization and 200 vehicles were damaged. 75 injuries were reported. The prevailing theory is that an underwater landslide caused the rogue wave, although others have theorized that it was the result of a squall line or a government experiment. { NOAA, Florida Weather History: Volusia County } { The Daytona Beach Wave of July 3–4, 1992: &apos;&apos;A Shallow Water Gravity Wave Forced by a Propagating Squall Line&apos;&apos;, January 1995 } [ Law and government ] [ Local Government ] Under Daytona Beach&apos;s commission-manager form of government, voters elect a City commission which consists of seven members who serve four-year, staggered terms.
