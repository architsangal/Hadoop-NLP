Harrell&apos;s boyfriend/ manager, Darryl Sambell, was impressed with Farnham&apos;s vocals and offered to become his manager. Initially performing in Sambell&apos;s home town of Adelaide, Farnham recorded an advertising jingle &quot; Susan Jones &quot; for Ansett ANA and was offered a solo record contract with EMI. [ 1967–79: Teen pop idol ] Farnham&apos;s first commercially successful recording was a novelty song entitled &quot; Sadie (The Cleaning Lady) &quot;, Sambell had disliked it as the lyrics were so persistent. However, EMI &apos;s in house producer, David MacKay, insisted and so the single was released in November 1967. The B-side, &quot; In My Room &quot; was written by Farnham.

Rofe continued the ploy on TV&apos;s Uptight and viewers responded with calls to play the song. It hit #1 on the Australian singles charts in January 1968 and remained there for 6 weeks. Selling 180,000 copies in Australia, &quot; Sadie &quot; was the highest selling single by an Australian artist of the decade. [ 1001 Australians You Should Know Creswell Toby Toby Creswell Samantha Trenoweth 2006 Pluto Press North Melbourne, Victoria 978-1-86403-361-8 27 December 2008 ] Rofe was also a writer for Go-Set, a teen-oriented pop magazine, another writer for the magazine, Ian &quot; Molly &quot; Meldrum, praised Farnham&apos;s efforts. Go-Set ran a pop poll to determine the &apos; King of Pop &apos; which was first won by Normie Rowe for 1967–1968. Farnham&apos;s 1968 singles were &quot; Underneath the Arches &quot; and &quot; I Don&apos;t Want to Love You &quot;, each peaked at #6. In 1969, Farnham released his album Everybody Oughta Sing a Song which peaked at #12 on the Australian albums charts. His next single was a cover of Harry Nilsson &apos;s &quot; One &quot;; Farnham&apos;s version peaked at #4. When television guide, TV Week sponsored the &apos;King of Pop&apos; awards, readers would forward their votes from coupons, Farnham won the most popular male award and was crowned &apos;King of Pop&apos; five consecutive times from 1969–1973. He recorded a cover of the B J Thomas hit &quot; Raindrops Keep Fallin&apos; on My Head &quot; which became his second #1 hit in December 1969 and remained at top spot for seven weeks into January 1970. Farnham&apos;s next album, Looking Through a Tear, was released in July 1970 and peaked at #11. &quot; Comic Conversations &quot;, his single from October, peaked at #10. During 1971, Farnham teamed with Allison Durbin, who had been chosen as &apos;Most Popular Female Performer&apos; at the &apos;King of Pop&apos; awards for 1969–1971. They released an album Together in September and a single &quot; Baby, Without You &quot; in November, both peaked into the top 30 of their respective charts. As well as his singing career, Farnham performed in stage musicals starting with Dick Whittington and His Cat in 1971 and on television variety shows either as a guest performer or as a host. At 22, Farnham was appointed &apos; King of Moomba &apos; in 1972 with Melbourne paper, The Sun, describing him as a &quot; likeable English migrant &quot; who is &quot; King of Pop, King of Kids and today Johnny Farnham was King of Moomba. &quot; [ Bellamy Craig Gordon Chisholm, Hilary Eriksen 17 February 2006 Moomba: A festival for the people http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Moomba/History%20of%20Moomba.pdf PDF 19 Melbourne, Vic 27 December 2008 ] [ July 2011 ] Another stage musical for Farnham was Charlie Girl in 1971.

Meldrum announced their wedding plans in Go-Set but Sambell denied the early reports, and, despite being best man at the wedding, was against Billman marrying Farnham. The clean-cut pop star had made several more albums and singles, but by the mid-1970s his recording career had begun to dwindle and he turned more to stage musicals and television. Farnham and &apos;Queen of Pop&apos; for 1972–1973, Colleen Hewett, combined on the 1973–1974 stage musical, Pippin, [ http://www.ausstage.edu.au/indexdrilldown.jsp?xcid%3D59%26amp%3Bf_event_id%3D14637 Pippin1973 AusStage 30 December 2008 ] [ http://www.ausstage.edu.au/indexdrilldown.jsp?xcid%3D59%26amp%3Bf_event_id%3D14947 Pippin1974 AusStage 30 December 2008 ] and its associated show album released in 1974. [ http://www.milesago.com/artists/hewett.htm Colleen Hewett Milesago 30 December 2008 ] Also in 1974, Farnham and Hewett were co-hosts of It&apos;s Magic, a children&apos;s TV series on Channel Ten. He became familiar to viewers of Countdown when hosting its first colour transmission in early 1975 and introducing Skyhooks &apos; performance of &quot; Horror Movie &quot;. Relations with Sambell became strained and in January 1976 they announced their split. Farnham first turned to Kenn Brodziak, producer of Pippin, for his management during 1976–1978 and then to Danny Finley, Hewett&apos;s then husband, from 1978. Farnham starred in a situation comedy series Bobby Dazzler as the title character during 1977–1978, and narrated documentaries including Survival with Johnny Farnham. Farnham was in financial trouble with unpaid taxes and the collapse of a restaurant venture with Hewett and Finley. Farnham&apos;s singing career was now confined to the cabaret circuit and stage musicals, in 1979 he changed his stage name to John Farnham. [ 1980–85: Little River Band era ] Farnham had met Glenn Wheatley, who was bass guitarist of 1960s rock group The Masters Apprentices, when both acts were managed by Sambell. Wheatley was now managing Little River Band (LRB) and in 1980 Farnham signed with Wheatley. They decided his comeback single would be a reworking of The Beatles &apos; &quot; Help! &quot;, which was produced by LRB&apos;s Graeham Goble, it peaked at #8. Farnham was utilising a more adult contemporary pop style and the associated album, Uncovered, also produced by Goble, peaked at #20. The B-side of &quot; Help &quot; was another of Farnham&apos;s songwriting efforts &quot; Jillie&apos;s Song &quot;, co-written with Goble. [ Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) &quot; Jillies Song &quot; at APRA search engine http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q%3DJillies%20Song 17 January 2009 ] In recording the album, Farnham&apos;s studio band were guitarist Tommy Emmanuel (ex-Southern Star Band), keyboardist Mal Logan (ex- Renée Geyer Band, LRB), drummer Derek Pellicci (LRB) and bass guitarist Barry Sullivan (ex-Chain). They became his tour band until Logan and Pellicci returned to their LRB commitments and were replaced by Sam McNally and David Jones respectively. In 1980, Farnham also appeared in a TV series, Farnham and Byrne with former Young Talent Time teen star and &apos; Queen of Pop &apos; Debra Byrne. Three other solo singles followed in 1981 but none charted into the Top 50. In February 1982, after Glenn Shorrock had departed Little River Band, Farnham became their lead vocalist with recommendations by Goble and Wheatley. Farnham had initially resisted the idea of joining LRB but Wheatley convinced him that Shorrock approved of the replacement. This continued Farnham&apos;s move away from cabaret and into rock music. As Little River Band was a successful band prior to Farnham joining, it was a surprise that they found little initial success. With Farnham, Little River Band recorded three studio albums, which had modest success – not enough to pay back the advances the record company had provided. The first studio album, The Net, was already written and Farnham had no say in the songs, he just had to record his lead vocals. In the US, charting albums with Farnham&apos;s vocals, were Greatest Hits (1982), The Net (1983) and Playing to Win (1984) on &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; Pop Albums chart /Billboard 200.

During this time, Farnham started supplying vocal tracks for films including, Savage Streets (1984), The Slugger&apos;s Wife (1985), and Fletch (1985); he later continued with Rad (1986) and Voyage of the Rock Aliens (1987). &quot; Justice for One &quot; was co-written by Farnham, [ Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) &quot; Justice for One &quot; at APRA search engine http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q%3DJustice%20for%20One 17 January 2009 ] [ http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout%3D300%26amp%3Bmode%3Dresults%26amp%3Bsearchstr%3D1505417%26amp%3Bsearch_in%3Dc%26amp%3Bsearch_type%3Dexact%26amp%3Bsearch_det%3Dt%2Cs%2Cw%2Cp%2Cb%2Cv%26amp%3Bresults_pp%3D20%26amp%3Bstart%3D1 The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) ASCAP 27 December 2008 ] for Savage Streets and it was released as a solo single. Little River Band recorded a concert in Melbourne that aired in the United States on HBO. The concert video was only one hour long, and it highlighted some of the songs from The Net as well as reworked versions of Little River Band classics such as &quot; Cool Change &quot; and &quot; Reminiscing &quot;. &quot; Please Don&apos;t Ask Me &quot;, a song written by Goble, [ Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) &quot; Please Don&apos;t Ask Me &quot; at APRA search engine http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q%3DPlease%20Dont%20Ask%20Me 17 January 2009 ] and a non-Top 50 single for Farnham almost three years previously, was played during the &quot; Australian Themed &quot; opening of the show. Despite positive Australian and US reviews and responses, this performance has not yet been released on VHS or DVD. In an interview with Channel Seven, Farnham stated, &quot; I&apos;ll be better off leaving, rather than putting myself under pressure that I&apos;ve created. &quot; Through this matter, it became apparent to the band that Farnham was intending on leaving and Playing to Win&apos;s lead single &quot; Playing to Win &quot;, a song believed by all to be the band&apos;s return to success, then started having authorship disputes. According to Farnham: [ [ &quot; Playing to Win &quot; was] about my frustration in the band, about wanting out, not wanting to be there any more. There was a bit of in-fighting and we were doing it hard on the road. That&apos;s what inspired the song. John Farnham ] As a result, Farnham&apos;s relationship with the band was further sullied. To date, the royalties for the song are meticulously divided with different shares to each of the song&apos;s contributors, including Goble, Farnham, Stephen Housden, David Hirschfelder and Wayne Nelson.

In mid-1986, Little River Band released the third studio album, No Reins, but Farnham was already pursuing his solo career. [ 1986–97: Peak solo years ] [ &quot; You&apos;re the Voice &quot; and Whispering Jack ] Farnham had started collecting a songlist for a future solo album while still in Little River Band, he finished his vocals for their album, No Reins, and left in late 1985. Farnham&apos;s first solo performances since 1981 were live shows with the John Farnham Band consisting of Brett Garsed on lead guitar, Sam See on guitar and Derek Pellicci, formerly of Little River Band, on drums. In early 1986, sound engineer Ross Fraser suggested to Farnham&apos;s manager Glenn Wheatley that it was time to start working on the solo album. Wheatley searched vainly for a producer and record label willing to work with Farnham, Fraser took on the producer role and Wheatley provided financial support after mortgaging his house. Whilst visiting a jazz club in the US, Farnham was mistakenly introduced as Jack Phantom, and when he subsequently provided a running commentary for a local pool game he named himself Whispering Jack Phantom after the Pot Black commentator &apos;Whispering&apos; Ted Lowe. Farnham&apos;s work for the album, Whispering Jack, included expanding his songlist with Fraser&apos;s advice. &quot; A Touch of Paradise &quot; was written by Gulliver Smith and Mondo Rock &apos;s Ross Wilson, [ Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) &quot; A Touch of Paradise &quot; at APRA search engine http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q%3DA%20Touch%20of%20Paradise 17 January 2009 ] while &quot; Pressure Down &quot; was provided by Harry Bogdanovs. [ Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) &quot; Pressure Down &quot; at APRA search engine http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q%3DPressure%20Down 17 January 2009 ] Two weeks before the album was due to be recorded a demo tape arrived from London with similar material as &quot; Pressure Down &quot;, Farnham and Fraser listened to the demo of &quot; You&apos;re the Voice &quot; and knew they had found a once-in-a-lifetime song. Another song on offer was &quot; We Built This City &quot; but Farnham knocked it back, it was later recorded by US band Starship. Initially, public interest in the re-branded former teen-idol was difficult to cultivate, and radio stations refused to play Farnham&apos;s album. Things however started to change after Sydney radio station 2Day FM played its first single, &quot; You&apos;re the Voice &quot;, which was released in September 1986. Henceforth, radio stations began receiving requests for the song.

After the success of the album, Farnham followed with Jack&apos;s Back Tour, an initial itinerary of eleven performances was thought to be enough considering they were up against tours by Michael Jackson and Billy Joel, but after high ticket sales, it was extended by eight more shows and use of larger venues. At that time, Jack&apos;s Back Tour was the highest grossing tour by an Australian act.
