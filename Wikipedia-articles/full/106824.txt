The population was 1,078 at the 2010 census. [ History ] { Cotter Bridge was critical in the development of The Ozarks. } Originally, the river bend was known as Lake&apos;s Ferry. In 1905, the Missouri Pacific Railroad bought the area and sold over one thousand lots, mostly to railroad employees. { Bennett, Lola and Smith, Corinne. &quot; Historic American Engineering Record Cotter Bridge (R.M. Ruthven Bridge). &quot; 1988. History. Page 3. Retrieved August 20, 2010. } The city was incorporated in 1905 as Cotter, Arkansas. { Ramey, Ann. &quot; Cotter Historical Briefs. &quot; History.

An inconvenient ferry system made the need for a bridge apparent. Locals wanted a bridge, but they strongly opposed a toll bridge. { Bennett, Lola and Smith, Corinne. &quot; Historic American Engineering Record Cotter Bridge (R.M. Ruthven Bridge). &quot; 1988. History. Page 6. Retrieved August 20, 2010. } Arkansas did not have a central highway body at the time, and was instead a patchwork of &quot; road districts &quot;, which made the bridge-building efforts even more difficult. Without a toll, funding wasn&apos;t available until Arkansas Highway 12 was redesignated U.S. Route 62 in 1930. The Cotter Bridge was constructed through the area using a unique rainbow arch design.
