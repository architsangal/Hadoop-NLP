Jacob Neusner (born July 28, 1932) is an American academic scholar of Judaism who lives in Rhinebeck, New York. [ Biography ] Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Neusner was educated at Harvard University, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (where he received rabbinic ordination), the University of Oxford, and Columbia University. Neusner is often celebrated as one of the most published authors in history (he has written or edited more than 950 books.) { See, 4th paragraph. } Since 1994, he has taught at Bard College. He has also taught at Columbia University, University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Brandeis University, Dartmouth College, Brown University, and the University of South Florida. Neusner is a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and a life member of Clare Hall, Cambridge University. He is the only scholar to have served on both the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts. [ March 2010 ] He also has received scores of academic awards, honorific and otherwise. [ Scholarship ] Neusner&apos;s scholarly activity is vast. Generally, his research centers around rabbinic Judaism of the Mishnaic and Talmudic Eras. He was a pioneer in the application of &quot; form criticism &quot; approach to Rabbinic texts. Much of Neusner&apos;s work has been to de-construct the prevailing approach viewing Rabbinic Judaism as a single religious movement within which the various Rabbinic texts were produced. In contrast, Neusner views each rabbinic document as an individual piece of evidence that can only shed light on the more local Judaisms of such specific document&apos;s place of origin and the specific Judaism of the author. His Judaism: The Evidence of the Mishnah (Chicago, 1981; translated into Hebrew and Italian) is the classic statement of his work and the first of many comparable volumes on the other documents of the rabbinic canon. Neusner’s method of studying documents individually without contextualizing them with other Rabbinic documents of the same era or genre, led to a series of very important studies on the way Judaism creates categories of understanding and how those categories relate to one another, even as they emerge diversely in discrete rabbinic documents. Neusner has translated into English nearly the entire Rabbinic canon. This work has opened up many Rabbinic documents to scholars of other fields unfamiliar with Hebrew and Aramaic. His translation technique utilizes a &quot; Harvard-outline &quot; format which attempts to make the argument flow of Rabbinic texts easier to understand for those unfamiliar with Talmudic reasoning. Neusner&apos;s enterprise has been aimed at a humanistic and academic reading of classics of Judaism. Neusner has been drawn from studying text to context. Treating a religion in its social setting, as something a group of people do together, rather than as a set of beliefs and opinions. [ Theological works ] In addition to his historical and textual works Neusner has also contributed to the area of Theology. He is the author of &quot; Israel: &quot; Judaism and its Social Metaphors and The Incarnation of God: The Character of Divinity in Formative Judaism. [ Contributions to Academia ] In addition to his scholarly activities, Neusner has been heavily involved in the shaping of Jewish and Religious Studies in the American University. He has sponsored a number of conferences and collaborative projects that drew different religions into conversation on common themes and problems. Neusner’s efforts have produced conferences and books on, among other topics, the problem of difference in religion, religion and society, religion and material culture, religion and economics, religion and altruism, and religion and tolerance. These collaborations build on Neusner’s intellectual vision, his notion of a religion as a system, and would not have happened otherwise. By working in the realm of Judaism and Jewish Religion, he developed methods and theories applicable to the study of Religion generally. Neusner has written a number of works exploring the relationship of Judaism to other religions. His A Rabbi Talks with Jesus (Philadelphia, 1993; translated into German, Italian, and Swedish), attempts to establish a religiously sound framework for Judaic-Christian interchange. It has earned the praise of Pope Benedict XVI and the nickname &quot; The Pope&apos;s Favorite Rabbi &quot;. In his book Jesus of Nazareth, Benedict refers to it as &quot; by far the most important book for the Jewish-Christian dialogue in the last decade. &quot; He also has collaborated with other scholars to produce comparisons of Judaism and Christianity, as in The Bible and Us: A Priest and A Rabbi Read Scripture Together ( New York 1990; translated into Spanish and Portuguese ). He has collaborated with scholars of Islam, conceiving World Religions in America: An Introduction (fourth edition, Louisville 2009), which explores how diverse religions have developed in the distinctive American context. He also has composed numerous textbooks and general trade books on Judaism. The two best-known examples are The Way of Torah: An Introduction to Judaism ( Belmont 2003); and Judaism: An Introduction ( London and New York 2002; translated into Portuguese and Japanese ). Throughout his career, Neusner has established publication programs and series with various academic publishers. Through these series, through reference works that he conceived and edited, and through the conferences he has sponsored, Neusner has advanced the careers of dozens of younger scholars from across the globe. Few others in the American study of religion have had this kind of impact on students of so many approaches and interests. Neusner has aimed to make Rabbinic literature useful to specialists in a variety of fields within the academic study of religion, as well as in ancient history, culture and Near and Middle Eastern Studies. His work has concerned the classic texts of Judaism and how they form a cogent statement of a religious system. [ Critical assessment of Neusner&apos;s work ] Although he is highly influential, Neusner has been criticized by scholars in his field of study. This summarizes the published studies that are critical of Neusner&apos;s work. { Shaye J. D.

(Offers an alternative to Neusner&apos;s theory of &quot; Judaisms. &quot; ) } Some scholars are critical of Neusner&apos;s methodology, and assert that many of his arguments are circular or attempt to prove &quot; negative assumptions &quot; from a lack of evidence (e.g., Cohen, Evans, Maccoby, Poirier, Sanders ). Others are critical of Neusner&apos;s reading and interpretations of Rabbinic texts, finding that his account is forced and inaccurate (e.g., Cohen, Evans, Maccoby, Poirier and in detail, Zuesse ). One methodological and historical critique of Neusner is by E. P. Sanders. In his earliest work, Neusner had argued that the most credible evidence showed that the Second Commonwealth Pharisees were a sectarian group centered on &quot; table fellowship &quot; and ritual food purity practices, and less interested in wider Jewish values or social issues. Zeitlin and Maccoby challenged this account. Sanders proposed that many of Neusner&apos;s interpretations of Pharisaic discussions and rulings were questionable (e.g., Neusner concludes that 67% of the debates between Pharisaic &quot; houses &quot; dealt with ritual food purity; Sanders concludes that less than 1% do—see Sanders, p.  177). Some scholars have questioned Neusner&apos;s grasp of Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic. Probably the most famous and biting criticism came from Saul Lieberman. { Saul Lieberman, &quot; A Tragedy or a Comedy &quot; Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol.104(2) April/June 1984 p. 315-319. About Neusner&apos;s translation of the Jerusalem Talmud, Lieberman wrote:...one begins to doubt the credibility of the translator [Neusner]. And indeed after a superficial perusal of the translation, the reader is stunned by [Neusner&apos;s] ignorance of Rabbinic Hebrew, of Aramaic grammar, and above all of the subject matter with which he deals. He ended his review: I conclude with a clear conscience: The right place for [Neusner&apos;s] English translation is the waste basket. } [ Books by Jacob Neusner ] A complete list of books by Professor Jacob Neusner may be found here: Jacob Neusner bibliography Additional biographical source: Jacob Neusner. &quot; From History to Religion. &quot; pp.  98–116 in The Craft of Religious Studies, edited by Jon R.
