[ Taxonomy ] The common minke whale was first identified by Lacepede in 1804. [ Mammal Species of the World http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?id%3D14300012 2007-07-13 ] There are several forms of common minke whale, including Scammon&apos;s minke whale (B. a. scammoni) from the North Pacific and the dwarf minke whale, from the Southern Hemisphere. Until recently, all minke whales were considered a single species. However, the common minke whale was recognized as a separate species from the Antarctic minke whale based on mitochondrial DNA testing. [ Cetacean mitochondrial DNA control region: sequences of all extant baleen whales and two sperm whale species http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/5/960 2007-07-13 ] This testing also confirmed that the Antarctic minke whale is the closest relative of the common minke whale, thus confirming the validity of the minke whale clade [ Description ] Skeleton of the Common minke whale. The common minke whale is the smallest of the rorqual s, and one of the smallest baleen whales (second smallest only to the Pygmy Right Whale ). Except for the dwarf form, length ranges from 7 to 9.8 meters and weight ranges from 5 to 10 ton s. [ Whales Dolphins and other Marine Mammals of the World Jarrett, Brett and Shirihai, Hadoram 2006 62–68 0-691-12757-3 ] On average, females are about 0.5 meters longer than males. [ Whales Dolphins and other Marine Mammals of the World Jarrett, Brett and Shirihai, Hadoram 2006 62–68 0-691-12757-3 ] Newborns range from 2.4 to 3.5 meters. The dwarf form has a smaller adult length of up to 7.8 meters. The back is dark grey and the belly white. All forms have a pale chevron above the flippers or behind the head. All forms also have a white or light marking on each flipper. On the dwarf form the white marking covers most of the flipper. On the northern forms, there is a distinct white band running horizontally through the middle of each flipper. This band is more grey in the Scammon&apos;s minke whales. The common minke whale differs from the Antarctic variety in several aspects. The common species is slightly smaller than the Antarctic, which has much less white marking on the flippers. There are also less distinctive differences in body coloration and shape. [ Distribution ] Common minke whales have a disjointed distribution. The non-dwarf forms live in the north Atlantic and north Pacific Ocean s. The Scammon form is also from the north Pacific. The dwarf form has a distribution completely separate from the other forms, living in southern oceans, and has a distribution generally north of the Antarctic species, although there is some overlap. [ Feeding ] Common minke whales have a diverse diet, feeding on various species of fish and crustaceans. In the North Atlantic, they prey on sand lance, sand eel, salmon, capelin, mackerel, cod, whiting, sprat, wolffish, dogfish, pollack, haddock, herring, euphausiids, and copepod s. In the North Pacific, they mainly eat euphausiids, Japanese anchovy, Pacific saury, and walleye pollack. In the Southern Ocean, dwarf minkes feed mainly on myctophid fishes. { Perrin, W. F., Bernd G. Würsig, and J. G. M. Thewissen. 2009. Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic Press. } [ Whaling ] [ Whaling ] Norwegian minke whale quotas (blue line, 1994-2006) and catches (red line, 1946.2005) in numbers (from Norwegian official statistics) Whaling was mentioned in Norwegian written sources as early as the year 800 and hunting common minke whales with harpoons was common in the 11th century [ August 2007 ]. By the end of the 1930s they were the target of coastal whaling from countries including Brazil, Canada, China, Greenland, Japan, Korea and Norway. Hunting continued apace until the general moratorium on whaling was introduced in 1986. Following the moratorium, most hunting of common minke whales ceased. Japan and more recently Iceland (in August 2003) have continued hunting for minkes on scientific grounds, which have been criticised by many environmental organisations { Help Us Stop Iceland&apos;s Whale Hunt! } as being a cover for commercial whaling. Both countries have the long-term goal of resuming open commercial whaling. [ December 2009 ] Although Norway initially followed the moratorium, they placed an objection to it with the IWC and resumed commercial hunting in 1993. Norwegian whalers caught 639 in 2005. The quota for 2006 was set at 1052 animals, from which a catch of 546 was taken. { Tok bare halve hvalkvoten - lofotposten.no } [ Common minke whale-watching ] Due to their relative abundance common minke whales are often the focus of whale-watching cruises setting sail from, for instance, the Isle of Mull in Scotland, County Cork in Ireland and Húsavík in Iceland. Common minke whales are frequently inquisitive and will indulge in &quot; human-watching &quot;. In contrast to the spectacularly acrobatic humpback whale, minkes do not raise their fluke out of the water when diving and are less likely to breach. Minkes can stay submerged for as long as twenty minutes. [ December 2009 ] [ Conservation status ] The common minke whale is considered &quot; Least Concern &quot; on the IUCN red list. In addition, the species is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region ( Pacific Cetaceans MOU ) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area ( ACCOBAMS ) [ References ] [ December 2009 ] [ Cetaceans ] [ External links ] Smithsonian Institution - North American Mammals: Balaenoptera acutorostrata Official webpage of the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region Official website of the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area [ M. ] Category:Baleen whales Category:Fauna of Ireland Category:Mammals of Europe Category:Megafauna of Eurasia Category:Megafauna of Africa Category:Megafauna of North America Category:Megafauna of South America Category:Megafauna of Australia Category:Megafauna Category:Fauna of Greenland Category:Cetaceans of Australia Category:Fauna of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fauna of the Pacific Ocean af:Minkewalvis zh-min-nan:Minke Hái-ang br:Balum begek ca:Rorqual d&apos;aleta blanca cs:Plejtvák malý da:Vågehval de:Zwergwal es:Balaenoptera acutorostrata eu:Zere txiki fa:نهنگ نیزه‌ای معمولی fr:Balaenoptera acutorostrata ga:Droimeiteach beag ko:쇠정어리고래 id:Paus minke is:Hrefna it:Balaenoptera acutorostrata he:לווייתן מינקי lt:Mažasis ruožuotis hu:Csukabálna mk:Остроклун кит nl:Dwergvinvis ja:ミンククジラ no:Vågehval pnb:اتلی منک وہیل pl:Płetwal karłowaty pt:Baleia-de-minke ru:Малый полосатик simple:Minke Whale sk:Vráskavec minke fi:Lahtivalas sv:Vikval tr:Bayağı minke balinası zh:小鬚鯨
