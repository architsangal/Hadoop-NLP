[ History ] The PSC was officially founded in 1972. The foundation was the result of the split of the unitary Christian Social Party–Christian People&apos;s Party (PSC-CVP) into the Dutch-speaking Christian People&apos;s Party (CVP) and the French-speaking Christian Social Party (PSC), following the increased linguistic tensions after the crisis at the University of Leuven in 1968. The PSC performed particularly badly in the 1999 general election. This was linked to several scandals, such as the escape of Marc Dutroux and the discovery of dioxine in chickens (the PSC was a coalition partner in the Dehaene government ). The decline in votes was also explained by declining adherence to Catholicism. The party was confined to opposition on all levels of government. The party started a process of internal reform. In 2001 a new charter of principles the &quot; Charter of Democratic Humanism &quot; was adopted and 2002 the party adopted a new constitution and a new name, Humanist Democratic Centre. In the 2003 general election the party did not perform much better and was still confined to opposition. After the 2004 regional elections the party returned to power in Brussels, in Walloon Region and the French Community together with the Socialist Party and Ecolo in Brussels, and with the Socialist Party in Walloon Region and the French Community. The current president of the party is Joëlle Milquet. In the 2007 general elections, the party won 10 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and 2 out of 40 seats in the Senate. In the 2010 general elections, the party lost 1 seat in the Chamber and kept its 2 seats in the Senate.
