[ Blackthorn ] [ Closeup of blackthorn aka sloe aka prunus spinosa sweden 20050924.jpg Fruit Plant ae Angiosperms Eudicots Rosids Rosales Rosaceae Prunus Prunus Prunus P. spinosa Prunus spinosa L. ] Prunus spinosa (blackthorn or sloe) is a species of Prunus native to Europe, western Asia, and locally in northwest Africa. { Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins ISBN 0-00-220013-9. } { Den Virtuella Floran: &apos;&apos;Prunus spinosa&apos;&apos; map } It is also locally naturalised in New Zealand and eastern North America. The expression &quot; sloe-eyed &quot; for a person with dark eyes comes from the fruit, and is first attested in A. J. Wilson &apos;s 1867 novel Vashti. { Oxford English Dictionary } [ Etymology ] The word &quot; sloe &quot; comes from Old English [ ang slāh ]. The same word is noted in Middle Low German, historically spoken in Lower Saxony, Middle Dutch sleuuwe or, contracted form, slē, from which come Modern Low German words: [ nds slē ], [ nds slī ], and Modern Dutch [ nl slee ], Old High German slēha &quot;, &quot; slēwa, from which come Modern German [ de Schlehe ] and Danish [ da slåen ]. All these come from Common Germanic root * [ gem slaiχwōn ]. Cf. West Slavic / Polish [ pl śliwa ]; plum of any species, including sloe [ pl śliwa tarnina ] – root present in other Slavic languages, e.g. Serbian / Croatian šljiva / шљива. [ Description ] Plant in flower in early spring Prunus spinosa is a deciduous large shrub or small tree growing to 5 m tall, with blackish bark and dense, stiff, spiny branches. The leaves are oval, 2–4.5  cm long and 1.2–2  cm broad, with a serrated margin. The flower s are 1.5  cm diameter, with five creamy-white petals; they are produced shortly before the leaves in early spring, and are hermaphroditic and insect -pollinated. The fruit, called a &quot; sloe &quot;, is a drupe [ 10 – 12 mm ] in diameter, black with a purple-blue waxy bloom, ripening in autumn, and harvested — traditionally, at least in the UK, in October or November after the first frosts. Sloes are thin-fleshed, with a very strongly astringent flavour when fresh. Prunus spinosa is frequently confused with the related P. cerasifera (cherry plum), particularly in early spring when the latter starts flowering somewhat earlier than P. spinosa. They can be distinguished by flower colour, creamy white in P. spinosa, pure white in P. cerasifera. They can also be distinguished in winter by the more shrubby habit with stiffer, wider-angled branches of P. spinosa; in summer by the relatively narrower leaves of P. spinosa, more than twice as long as broad; { Vedel, H., &amp; Lange, J. (1960). Trees and Bushes in Wood and Hedgerow. Metheun &amp; Co. Ltd., London. } and in autumn by the colour of the fruit skin — purplish-black in P. spinosa and yellow or red in P. cerasifera. Prunus spinosa has a tetraploid (2n=4x=32) set of chromosomes. { Weinberger, J. H. 1975. Plums. Pp. 336–347 in Advances in fruit breeding, eds. J. Janick and J. N. Moore. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press. } [ Ecology ] See also List of Lepidoptera that feed on Prunus { Taphrina pruni &apos;&apos; } The foliage is sometimes eaten by the larva e of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, double square-spot, black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth ( Scythropia crataegella ) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides food for the caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella. The pocket plum gall is found on the fruit, where it results in an elongated and flattened gall, devoid of a stone. [ Uses ] { Plum and sloe output in 2005 } { Husband and Wife tree } The shrub, with its savage thorns, is traditional in Northern Europe and Britain in making a hedge proof against cattle. { Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. &quot; Prunus &quot;. } The fruit is similar to a small damson or plum, suitable for preserves, but rather tart and astringent for eating, unless it is picked after the first few days of autumn frost. This effect can not be reproduced by freezing harvested sloes, but is the result of the plant withdrawing tannin s from the sloes in freezing weather. [ November 2010 ] The juice is used in the manufacture of spurious port wine, and used as an adulterant to impart roughness to genuine port. [ Sloe 1905 ] [ Sloe 1920 1 ] In rural Britain, so-called sloe gin is made from the fruit, though this is not a true gin, but an infusion of vodka, gin, or neutral spirits with the fruit and sugar to produce a liqueur. In Navarre, Spain, a popular liqueur called [ eu patxaran ] is made with sloes. In France a similar liqueur called [ fr épine ] ( &quot; spine &quot; ) is made from the young shoots in spring. In Italy, the infusion of spirit with the fruits and sugar produces a liqueur called bargnolino (or sometimes prunella). Wine made from fermented sloes is made in Britain, and in Germany and other central European countries. Sloes can also be made into jam and, used in fruit pies, and if preserved in vinegar are similar in taste to Japanese umeboshi. The juice of the berries dyes linen a reddish color that washes out to a durable pale blue. { Coats (1964) 1992. } Blackthorn makes an excellent fire wood that burns slowly with a good heat and little smoke. { The Scout Association 1999. The Burning Properties of Wood, London, U.K. } The wood takes a fine polish and is used for tool handles and canes. [ Sloe 1 ] Straight blackthorn stems have traditionally been made into walking sticks or clubs (known in Ireland as a shillelagh ). [ Chouinard B.A. Maxime The stick is king: The Shillelagh Bata or the rediscovery of a living Irish martial tradition http://www.freifechter.com/files/stick_edited.pdf 5 July 2011 ] In the British Army, blackthorn sticks are carried by commissioned officers of the Royal Irish Regiment; the tradition also occurs in Irish regiments in some Commonwealth countries. The leaves resemble tea leaves, and were used as an adulterant of tea. Shlomo Yitzhaki, a Talmudist and Tanakh commentator of the High Middle Ages, writes that the sap (or gum ) of P. spinosa (or what he refers to as the [ fr prunellier ] ) was used as an ingredient in the making of some inks used for manuscripts. { Talmud Bavli, Tractate Shabbat 23a } The fruit stones have been found in Swiss lake dwellings. A &quot; sloe-thorn worm &quot; used as fishing bait is mentioned in the 15th century work, The Treatyse of Fishing with an Angle, by Juliana Berners. { &apos;&apos;The Treatyse of Fishing with an Angle&apos;&apos; (attributed to Dame } { Juliana Berners in the 15th century) } [ See also ] Sloe gin [ References ] [ External links ] [ Prunus spinosa ] Cookipedia entry for Sloe Recipes spinosa Category:Medicinal plants Category:Flora of Europe Category:Berries Category:Plants described in 1753 [ pl ] kbd:Пыжъ ar:خوخ شوكي an:Prunus spinosa frp:Belociér ast:Prunus spinosa az:Göyəm (ağac) ba:Тёрн be:Цёрн bar:Schlehdorn ca:Aranyoner cs:Trnka obecná da:Slåen de:Schlehdorn dsb:Puckowina et:Laukapuu es:Prunus spinosa eo:Prunelo eu:Elorri beltz fr:Prunellier fur:Sespâr gv:Drine airn gd:Àirne gl:Abruñeiro hy:Մամուխ hsb:Dorničel hr:Trnina io:Prunelo os:Какон it:Prunus spinosa ka:კვრინჩხი csb:Psónka lt:Dygioji slyva li:Sjlièkreek hu:Kökény nl:Sleedoorn ja:スピノサスモモ no:Slåpetorn oc:Agrenièr pms:Prunus spinosa pl:Śliwa tarnina pt:Prunus spinosa ro:Porumbar ru:Тёрн sco:Prunus spinosa stq:Släieboom scn:Prunus spinosa sl:Kökény fi:Oratuomi sv:Slån uk:Терен vi:Mận gai wa:Purnalî vls:Sleedôorn zh:黑刺李
