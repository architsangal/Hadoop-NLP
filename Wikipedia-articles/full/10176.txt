Experimental cancer treatments are medical therapies intended or claimed to treat cancer (see also tumor ) by improving on, supplementing or replacing conventional methods ( surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy ). The entries listed below vary between theoretical therapies to unproven controversial therapies. Many of these treatments are alleged to help against only specific forms of cancer. It is not a list of treatments widely available at hospitals. [ Studying treatments for cancer ] [ Drug discovery ] The twin goals of research are to determine whether the treatment actually works (called efficacy ) and whether it is sufficiently safe. Regulatory processes attempt to balance the potential benefits with the potential harms, so that people given the treatment are more likely to benefit from it than to be harmed by it. Medical research for cancer begins much like research for any disease. In organized studies of new treatments for cancer, the pre-clinical development of drugs, devices, and techniques begins in laboratories, either with isolated cells or in small animals, most commonly rats or mice. In other cases, the proposed treatment for cancer is already in use for some other medical condition, in which case more is known about its safety and potential efficacy. Clinical trial s are the study of treatments in humans. The first-in-human tests of a potential treatment are called Phase I studies. Early clinical trials typically enroll a very small number of patients, and the purpose is to identify major safety issues and the maximum tolerated dose, which is the highest dose that does not produce serious or fatal adverse effect s. The dose given in these trials may be far too small to produce any useful effect. In most research, these early trials may involve healthy people, but cancer studies normally enroll only people with relatively severe forms of the disease in this stage of testing. On average, 95% of the participants in these early trials receive no benefit, but all are exposed to the risk of adverse effects. [ When Optimism Is Unrealistic Chen, Pauline W. 3 March 2011 http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/health/views/03chen.html The New York Times ] Most participants show signs of optimism bias (the irrational belief that they will beat the odds). Later studies, called Phase II and Phase III studies, enroll more people, and the goal is to determine whether the treatment actually works. Phase III studies are frequently randomized controlled trial s, with the experimental treatment being compared to the current best available treatment rather than to a placebo. In some cases, the Phase III trial provides the best available treatment to all participants, in addition to some of the patients receiving the experimental treatment. [ Bacterial treatments ] Chemotherapeutic drugs have a hard time penetrating tumors to kill them at their core because these cells may lack a good blood supply. Researchers have been using anaerobic bacteria, such as Clostridium novyi, to consume the interior of oxygen-poor tumours. These should then die when they come in contact with the tumour&apos;s oxygenated sides, meaning they would be harmless to the rest of the body. A major problem has been that bacteria do not consume all parts of the malignant tissue. However, combining the therapy with chemotheraputic treatments can help to solve this problem. Another strategy is to use anaerobic bacteria that have been transformed with an enzyme that can convert a non-toxic prodrug into a toxic drug. With the proliferation of the bacteria in the necrotic and hypoxic areas of the tumour, the enzyme is expressed solely in the tumour. Thus, a systemically applied prodrug is metabolised to the toxic drug only in the tumour. This has been demonstrated to be effective with the nonpathogenic anaerobe Clostridium sporogenes.

It has been tested in humans with skin papilloma s and bladder cancer. [ Hallgren O, Aits S, Brest P, Gustafsson L, Mossberg AK, Wullt B, Svanborg C. Apoptosis and tumor cell death in response to HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology. 2008 217–240 18183931 10.1007/978-0-387-74087-4_8 606 Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology 978-0-387-74086-7 ] [ Dichloroacetate ] Dichloroacetate (DCA) has been found to shrink tumors in vitro in rats, and has a plausible scientific mechanism: DCA appears to reactivate suppressed mitochondria in some types of oxygen-starved tumor cells, and thus promotes apoptosis. [ Michelakis ED, Webster L, Mackey JR Dichloroacetate (DCA) as a potential metabolic-targeting therapy for cancer Br. J. Cancer 99 7 989–94 2008 October 18766181 2567082 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604554 ] Because it was tested for other conditions, DCA is known to be relatively safe, available, and inexpensive, and it can be taken by mouth as a pill, which is convenient. Early animal studies received attention in the media, [ http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id%3Ddn10971 Cheap, ‘safe’ drug kills most cancers 17 January 2007 17 January 2007 New Scientist ] and some doctors began controversially using the chemical off-label. { http://www.nationalreviewofmedicine.com/issue/poll/featured_article.html } [ 2008 ], no patients had been treated with DCA in a clinical trial, and so its actual effectiveness is unknown. [ Quercetin ] In vitro, quercetin shows some antitumor activity. Cultured skin and prostate cancer cells showed significant mortality (compared to nonmalignant cells) when treated with a combination of quercetin and ultrasound [ Induction of cancer-specific cytotoxicity towards human prostate and skin cells using quercetin and ultrasound British Journal of Cancer 92 3 499–502 2005 http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v92/n3/abs/6602364a.html 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602364 Paliwal S 15685239 Sundaram J Mitragotri S 2362095 ] Note that ultrasound also promotes topical absorption by up to 1,000 times, making the use of topical quercetin and ultrasound wands an interesting proposition. [ April 2009 ] High dietary intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduction in cancer, and some scientists [ June 2009 ] suspect quercetin may be partly responsible. Research shows that quercetin influences cellular mechanisms in vitro and in animal studies, and there is limited evidence from human population studies that quercetin may reduce the risk of lung cancer. [ Neuhouser ML Dietary flavonoids and cancer risk: evidence from human population studies Nutr Cancer 50 1 1–7 2004 15572291 10.1207/s15327914nc5001_1 ] [ Murakami A, Ashida H, Terao J Multitargeted cancer prevention by quercetin Cancer Lett. 269 2 315–25 2008 October 18467024 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.03.046 ] [ Insulin potentiation therapy ] In insulin potentiation therapy (IPT), insulin is a controversial supplement to low-dose chemotherapy. Its proponents claim insulin therapy increases the uptake of chemotherapeutic drugs by malignant cells, permitting the use of lower total drug doses and reducing side-effects. The first clinical trial, involving 30 women with breast cancer, combined insulin with low-dose methotrexate (a common chemotherapy drug) resulted in greatly increased stable disease, and much reduced progressive disease, compared with insulin or low-dose methotrexate alone.

Pharmacol. 53 3 220–4 2004 March 14655024 10.1007/s00280-003-0716-7 ] [ Drugs that restore p53 activity ] Several drug therapies are being developed based on p53, the tumour suppressor gene that protects the cell in response to damage and stress. It is analogous to deciding what to do with a damaged car: p53 brings everything to a halt, and then decides whether to fix the cell or, if the cell is beyond repair, to destroy the cell. This protective function of p53 is disabled in most cancer cells, allowing them to multiply without check. Restoration of p53 activity in tumours (where possible) has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and can even shrink the tumour. [ Martins CP, Brown-Swigart L, Evan GI Modeling the therapeutic efficacy of p53 restoration in tumors Cell 127 7 1323–34 2006 December 17182091 10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.007 ] [ Ventura A, Kirsch DG, McLaughlin ME, Tuveson DA, Grimm J, Lintault L, Newman J, Reczek EE, Weissleder R, Jacks T Restoration of p53 function leads to tumour regression in vivo Nature 445 7128 606–7 2007 February 17251932 10.1038/nature05541 ] [ Xue W, Zender L, Miething C, Dickins RA, Hernando E, Krizhanovsky V, Cordon-Cardo C, Lowe SW Senescence and tumour clearance is triggered by p53 restoration in murine liver carcinomas Nature 445 7128 656–60 2007 February 17251933 10.1038/nature05529 ] As p53 protein levels are usually kept low, one could block its degradation and allow large amounts of p53 to accumulate, thus stimulating p53 activity and its antitumour effects. Drugs that utilize this mechanism include nutlin and MI-219, which are both in phase I clinical trials. [ Brown CJ, Lain S, Verma CS, Fersht AR, Lane DP Awakening guardian angels: drugging the p53 pathway Nat Rev Cancer 9 12 862–73 2009 December 19935675 10.1038/nrc2763 ] There are also other drugs that are still in the preclinical stage of testing, such as RITA [ Issaeva N, Bozko P, Enge M, Protopopova M, Verhoef LG, Masucci M, Pramanik A, Selivanova G Small molecule RITA binds to p53, blocks p53-HDM-2 interaction and activates p53 function in tumors Nat Med 10 12 1321–8 2004 December 15558054 10.1038/nm1146 ] and MITA.

BI 811283 is currently in the early stages of clinical development and is undergoing first-in-human trials in patients with solid tumor s and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. [ 28 15 Suppl e13632 Gürtler U.

Oncol. 2010 ] [ Gene therapy ] [ Virotherapy Oncolytic virus ] Introduction of tumor suppressor gene s into rapidly dividing cells has been thought to slow down or arrest tumor growth. Adenoviruses are a commonly utilized vector for this purpose. Much research has focused on the use of adenoviruses that cannot reproduce, or reproduce only to a limited extent, within the patient to ensure safety via the avoidance of cytolytic destruction of noncancerous cells infected with the vector. However, new studies focus on adenoviruses that can be permitted to reproduce, and destroy cancerous cells in the process, since the adenoviruses&apos; ability to infect normal cells is substantially impaired, potentially resulting in a far more effective treatment.

Takayama Koichi Ristimäki Ari Desmond Renee A. Hemminki Akseli ] Another use of gene therapy is the introduction of enzyme s into these cells that make them susceptible to particular chemotherapy agents; studies with introducing thymidine kinase in glioma s, making them susceptible to aciclovir, are in their experimental stage. [ Telomerase therapy ] Because most malignant cells rely on the activity of the protein telomerase for their immortality, it has been proposed that a drug that inactivates telomerase might be effective against a broad spectrum of malignancies. At the same time, most healthy tissues in the body express little if any telomerase, and would function normally in its absence. Currently, Inositol hexaphosphate, which is available over-the-counter, is undergoing testing in cancer research due to its telomerase-inhibiting abilities. [ Jagadeesh S, Banerjee PP Inositol hexaphosphate represses telomerase activity and translocates TERT from the nucleus in mouse and human prostate cancer cells via the deactivation of Akt and PKCalpha Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 349 4 1361–7 2006 November 16979586 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.09.002 ] A number of research groups have experimented with the use of telomerase inhibitor s in animal model s, and as of 2005 and 2006 phase I and II human clinical trials are underway. Geron Corporation, is currently conducting two clinical trials involving telomerase inhibitors. One uses a vaccine ( GRNVAC1 ) and the other uses a lipidated oligonucleotide( GRN163L ). [ Radiation therapies ] [ Photodynamic therapy ] Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is generally a non-invasive treatment using a combination of light and a photosensitive drug, such as 5-ALA, Foscan, Metvix, Tookad, WST09, WST11, Photofrin, or Visudyne. The drug is triggered by light of a specific wavelength. [ Hyperthermia therapy ] [ Hyperthermia therapy ] Localized and whole-body application of heat has been proposed as a technique for the treatment of malignant tumours. Intense heating will cause denaturation and coagulation of cellular protein s, rapidly killing cells within a tumour. More prolonged moderate heating to temperatures just a few degrees above normal (39,5°C) can cause more subtle changes. A mild heat treatment combined with other stresses can cause cell death by apoptosis. There are many biochemical consequences to the heat shock response within the cell, including slowed cell division and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation therapy. The purpose of overheating the tumor cells is to create a lack of oxygen so that the heated cells become overacidified, which leads to a lack of nutrients in the tumor. This in turn disrupts the metabolism of the cells so that cell death (apoptosis) can set in. In certain cases chemotherapy or radiation that has previously not had any effect can be made effective. Hyperthermia alters the cell walls by means of so-called heat shock proteins. The cancer cells then react very much more effectively to the cytostatics and radiation. If hyperthermia is used conscientiously it has no serious side effects. { Dr med Peter Wolf, 2008, Innovations in biological cancer therapy, a guide for patients and their relatives, p 31-32 } There are many techniques by which heat may be delivered. Some of the most common involve the use of focused ultrasound (FUS or HIFU ), microwave heating, induction heating, magnetic hyperthermia, and direct application of heat through the use of heated saline pumped through catheters. Experiments with carbon nanotubes that selectively bind to cancer cells have been performed. Lasers are then used that pass harmlessly through the body, but heat the nanotubes, causing the death of the cancer cells. Similar results have also been achieved with other types of nanoparticles, including gold-coated nanoshells and nanorods that exhibit certain degrees of &apos;tunability&apos; of the absorption properties of the nanoparticles to the wavelength of light for irradiation. The success of this approach to cancer treatment rests on the existence of an &apos;optical window&apos; in which biological tissue (i.e., healthy cells) are completely transparent at the wavelength of the laser light, while nanoparticles are highly absorbing at the same wavelength. Such a &apos;window&apos; exists in the so-called near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, the laser light can pass through the system without harming healthy tissue, and only diseased cells, where the nanoparticles reside, get hot and are killed. Magnetic hyperthermia makes use of magnetic nanoparticles, which can be injected into tumours and then generate heat when subjected to an alternating magnetic field. { Hyperthermia - Cancer therapy hots up on physics.org } One of the challenges in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient&apos;s body. A great deal of current research focuses on precisely positioning heat delivery devices (catheters, microwave, and ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, as well as of developing new types of nanoparticles that make them particularly efficient absorbers while offering little or no concerns about toxicity to the circulation system. Clinicians also hope to use advanced imaging techniques to monitor heat treatments in real time—heat-induced changes in tissue are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. [ Non-invasive cancer treatment ] [ Non-invasive RF cancer treatment ] This preclinical treatment involves using radio waves to heat up tiny metals that are implanted in cancerous tissue. Gold nanoparticle s or carbon nanotube s are the most likely candidate. Promising preclinical trials have been conducted, [ Research on local man&apos;s cancer treatment idea shows it has promise David Templeton Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 18 January 2007 4 November 2007 http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07018/754702-114.stm ] [ Gannon CJ Carbon nanotube-enhanced thermal destruction of cancer cells in a noninvasive radiofrequency field Cancer 110 12 2654–65 2007 December 17960610 10.1002/cncr.23155, Cherukuri P Yakobson BI 3 Cognet Laurent Kanzius John S.

Winknews.com 1 November 2007 http://www.winknews.com/features/health/10949561.html ] Another method that is entirely non-invasive referred to as Tumor Treating Fields has already reached clinical trial stage in many countries. The concept applies an electric field through a tumour region using electrodes external to the body. Successful trials have shown the process effectiveness to be greater than chemotherapy and there are no side-effects and only negligible time spent away from normal daily activities. { http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21548832/ } [ 2012 Tumour Treating Fields explained ted.com 31 January 2012 http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_doyle_treating_cancer_with_electric_fields.html ] This treatment is still in very early development stages for many types of cancer.. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is still in investigatory phases in many places around the world. In China it has CFDA approval and over 180 treatment centres have been established in China, Hong Kong, and Korea. HIFU has been successfully used to treat cancer to destroy tumours of the bone, brain, breast, liver, pancreas, rectum, kidney, testes, and prostate. Several thousand patients have been treated with various types of tumours. HIFU has CE approval for palliative care for bone metastasis. Experimentally, palliative care has been provided for cases of advanced pancreatic cancer. [ Complementary and alternative treatments ] [ Alternative cancer treatments ] Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments are the diverse group of medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not part of conventional medicine and have not been shown to be effective. [ Cassileth BR, Deng G Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer Oncologist 9 1 80–9 2004 14755017 http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/9/1/80 10.1634/theoncologist.9-1-80 ] Complementary medicine usually refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while alternative medicine refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine. { What Is CAM? } { National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. retrieved 3 February 2008. } CAM use is common among people with cancer.
