It was the first of six colonial wars (see the four French and Indian Wars, Father Rale&apos;s War and Father Le Loutre&apos;s War ) fought between New France and New England along with their respective Native allies before Britain eventually defeated France in North America in 1763. For King William&apos;s War, neither England nor France thought of weakening their position in Europe to support the war effort in North America. { Bromley: The New Cambridge Modern History VI: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia 1688–1725, 488 } New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy were able to thwart New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. { William Williamson.

[ Cause of war ] [ For further details on the war&apos;s European causes, see Nine Years&apos; War and Glorious Revolution. ] England&apos;s Catholic King James II was deposed at the end of 1688 in the Glorious Revolution, after which Protestants William and Mary took the throne. William joined the League of Augsburg in its war against France (begun earlier in 1688), where James had fled. In North America, there was significant tension between New France and the northern English colonies, which had in 1686 been united in the Dominion of New England. New England and the Iroquois Confederacy fought New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy. The Iroquois dominated the economically important Great Lakes fur trade and had been in conflict with New France since 1680. { The Iroquois restoration: Iroquois diplomacy on the colonial frontier, 1701-1754 By Richard Aquila. University of Nebraska Press. 1997. p. 43 } At the urging of New England, the Iroquois interrupted the trade between New France and the western tribes. In retaliation, New France raided Seneca lands of western New York. In turn, New England supported the Iroquois in attacking New France, which they did by raiding Lachine. { The Iroquois restoration: Iroquois diplomacy on the colonial frontier, 1701-1754 By Richard Aquila. University of Nebraska Press. 1997. p. 44 } There were similar tensions on the border between New England and Acadia, which New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. { William Williamson. The history of the state of Maine. Vol. 2. 1832. p. 27; Griffiths, E. From Migrant to Acadian. McGill-Queen&apos;s University Press. 2005. p.61; Campbell, Gary.

Goose Lane Editions and The New Brunswick Heritage Military Project. 2005. p. 21. } English settlers from Massachusetts (whose charter included the Maine area) had expanded their settlements into Acadia. To secure New France&apos;s claim to present-day Maine, New France established Catholic missions among the three largest native villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River ( Norridgewock ); one further north on the Penobscot River ( Penobscot ) and one on the St. John River ( Medoctec ).

University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, p. 51, p. 54. } For their part, in response to King Philip&apos;s War, the five Indian tribes in the region of Acadia created the Wabanaki Confederacy to form a political and military alliance with New France to stop the New England expansion. { http://www.wabanaki.com/Harald_Prins.htm } [ War ] Map of the campaigns. [ Acadia and New England Theatre ] The Acadia and New England Theatre of the war is also known as Castin&apos;s War. { Herbert Milton Sylvester. Indian Wars of New England: The land of the Abenake. The French occupation. King Philip&apos;s war. St. Castin&apos;s war 1910. } In April 1688, Governor Andros plundered Castine&apos;s home and village on Penobscot Bay ( Castine, Maine ). { William Williamson. The History of the State of Maine. p. 607 } Later in August, the British raided the French village of Chedabouctou. In response, Castin and the Wabanaki Confederacy engaged in the Northeast Coast Campaign of 1688 along the New England/Acadia border. They began August 13, 1688 at New Dartmouth ( Newcastle ), killing a few settlers. A few days later they killed two people at North Yarmouth. At Kennebunk, in the fall of 1688, members of the Confederacy killed two families. In June 1689, several hundred Abenaki and Pennacook Indians under the command of Kancamagus and Mesandowit raided Dover, New Hampshire, killing more than 20 and taking 29 captives, who were sold into captivity in New France. In June, they killed four men at Saco. In response to these raids, a company of 24 men were raised to search for the bodies and pursue the natives. They were forced to return after they lost a quarter of their men in conflicts with the natives. { Clayton, W. W. Full text of &quot; History of York County, Maine. With illustrations and biographical sketches of its prominent men and pioneers &quot;, 1888. p. 51 } In August 1689, Jean-Vincent d&apos;Abbadie de Saint-Castin and Father Louis-Pierre Thury { http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=562 &amp; PHPSESSID=m3tj852vp2kc6522vmk91nd765 } led an Abenaki war party that captured and destroyed the fort at Pemaquid (in present-day Bristol, Maine ) in August 1689. The fall of Pemaquid was a significant set back to the English. It pushed the frontier back to Casco (Falmouth), Maine. { Conquering the American wilderness: the triumph of European warfare in... By Guy Chet, p. 81 } { Major Benjamin Church - Father of } { American Ranging } New England retaliated for these raids by sending Major Benjamin Church to raid Acadia. During King William&apos;s War, Church led four New England raiding parties into Acadia (which included most of Maine ) against the Acadians and members of the Wabanaki Confederacy. On the first expedition into Acadia, on September 21, 1689, Church and 250 troops defended a group of English settlers trying to establish themselves at Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine ). The tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy killed 21 of his men, but Church&apos;s defense was successful and the natives retreated. { Drake, The Border Wars of New England, p. 33 } Church then returned to Boston leaving the small group of English settlers unprotected. The following spring over 400 French and native troops, under the leadership of Castin, destroyed Salmon Falls (present-day Berwick, Maine ), then returned to Falmouth and massacred all the British settlers in the Battle of Fort Loyal. When Church returned to the village later that summer he buried the dead. { Benjamin Church, Thomas Church, Samuel Gardner Drake, The history of the great Indian war of 1675 and 1676, commonly called Philip..., pp.175-176 } The fall of Fort Loyal (Casco) led to the near depopulation of Maine. Native forces were then able to attack New Hampshire frontier without reprisal. { Conquering the American wilderness: the triumph of European warfare in... By Guy Chet; p. 82 } [ Battle of Port Royal (1690) ] [ Battle of Port Royal (1690) ] The New Englanders, led by Sir William Phips, retaliated by attacking Port Royal, the capital of Acadia. The Battle of Port Royal began on May 9, 1690. { John Reid, &quot; 1686-1720: Imperial Intrusions &quot;, in Buckner, P. and Reid J. (eds), The Atlantic Region to Confederation: A History, Toronto University Press. 1994. p. 82. } Phips arrived with 736 New England men in seven English ships. Governor de Meneval fought for two days and then capitulated. The garrison was imprisoned in the church, and Governor de Meneval was confined to his house. The New Englanders levelled what was begun of the new fort. { Brenda Dunn. A History of Port Royal, Annapolis Royal: 1605-1800. Nimbus Publishing, 2004. p. 38 } The residents of Port Royal were imprisoned in the church and administered an oath of allegiance to the King. { Brenda Dunn. A History of Port Royal, Annapolis Royal: 1605-1800. Nimbus Publishing, 2004. p. 39 } Phips left, but war ships from New York arrived in June which resulted in more destruction. { John Reid. &quot; 1686-1720: Imperial Intrusions &quot;. In Buckner, P. and Reid J. (eds). The Atlantic Region to Confederation: A History. Toronto University Press. 1994. p. 82. } The seamen burned and looted the settlement, including the parish church. { Brenda Dunn. A History of Port Royal, Annapolis Royal: 1605-1800. Nimbus Publishing, 2004. p. 40 } The New Englanders left again, and Villebon, the Governor of Acadia, moved the capital to safer territory inland at Fort Nashwaak (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick ). Fort Nashwaak remained the capital until after the war, when Port Royal was restored as the capital in 1699. { Dunn, p. 45 } { Baron de St Castin } In Church&apos;s second expedition to Acadia, he arrived with 300 men at Casco Bay on 11 September 1690. His mission was to relieve the English Fort Pejpescot (present day Brunswick, Maine ), which had been taken by the Wabanaki Confederacy. { Benjamin Church, Thomas Church, Samuel Gardner Drake, The history of the great Indian war of 1675 and 1676, commonly called Philip..., pp.179-180 } He went up the Androscoggin River to Fort Pejepscot. { Drake, p. (66) } From there he went [ 40 mi ] upriver to Livermore Falls and attacked a native village. Church&apos;s men shot three or four native men when they were retreating. Church discovered five English captives in the wigwams. Church butchered six or seven natives and took nine prisoners. { Drake, p. (67); } A few days later, in retaliation, the members of the Wabanaki Confederacy attacked Church at Cape Elizabeth on Purpooduc Point, killing 7 of his men and wounding 24 others. { Drake, p.69 } On September 26, Church returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. During King William&apos;s War, when the town of Wells contained about 80 houses and log cabins strung along the Post Road, it was attacked on June 9, 1691, by about 200 Native Americans commanded by the sachem Moxus. But Captain James Converse and his militia successfully defended Lieutenant Joseph Storer&apos;s garrison, which was surrounded by a gated palisade. Another sachem, Madockawando, threatened to return the next year &quot; and have the dog Converse out of his den &quot;. [ Roach Marilynne K.

They also burned a hamlet. { Clayton, W. W. Full text of &quot; History of York County, Maine. With illustrations and biographical sketches of its prominent men and pioneers &quot;, 1888. p. 51 } In early 1692, an estimated 150 Abenakis commanded by officers of New France returned to York, killing about 100 of the English settlers and burning down buildings in what would become known as the Candlemas Massacre. Church&apos;s third expedition to Acadia during the war was in 1692 when he raided Penobscot (present-day Indian Island, Maine ) with 450 men. { Benjamin Church, Thomas Church, Samuel Gardner Drake, The history of the great Indian war of 1675 and 1676, commonly called Philip... p. 212 } Church and his men then went on to raid Taconock ( Winslow, Maine ). { Church, p. 214 } In 1693, New England frigates attacked Port Royal again, burning almost a dozen houses and three barns full of grain. { Brenda Dunn. A History of Port Royal, Annapolis Royal: 1605-1800. Nimbus Publishing, 2004. p. 43 } On July 18, 1694, French soldier Claude-Sébastien de Villieu with about 250 Abenakis from Norridgewock under command of their sagamore (paramount chief), Bomazeen (or Bomoseen) raided the English settlement of Durham, New Hampshire, in the &quot; Oyster River Massacre &quot;. In all, the French and native force killed 45 inhabitants and took 49 captive, burning half the dwellings, including five garrison s. They also destroyed crops and killed livestock, causing famine and destitution for the survivors. [ Siege of Pemaquid (1696) ] [ Siege of Pemaquid (1696) ] { Pierre Le Moyne d&apos;Iberville } In 1696, New France and the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy, led by St. Castine and Pierre Le Moyne d&apos;Iberville, returned and fought a naval battle in the Bay of Fundy before moving on to raid Pemaquid, Maine. In retaliation, Church went on his fourth expedition to Acadia and carried out a retaliatory raid against Acadian communities on the Isthmus of Chignecto and Fort Nashwack (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick ), which was then the capital of Acadia. { Benjamin Church, Thomas Church, Samuel Gardner Drake, The history of the great Indian war of 1675 and 1676, commonly called Philip... p.215 } Despite weighing approximately [ 250 lb ], he led his troops personally in killing inhabitants of Chignecto, looting their household goods, burning their houses and slaughtering the livestock. [ Quebec, New York, and Newfoundland Theatre ] Also in August 1689, 1,500 Iroquois, seeking revenge for Denonville&apos;s actions, attacked the French settlement at Lachine. Count Frontenac, who replaced Denonville as governor general, later attacked the Iroquois village of Onondaga. New France and its Indian allies then attacked English frontier settlements in early 1690, most notably at Schenectady in New York. This was followed up by two expeditions. One, on land under Connecticut provincial militia general Fitz-John Winthrop, targeted Montreal; the other, led by Sir William Phips, targeted Quebec. Winthrop&apos;s expedition failed due to disease and supply issues, and Phips was defeated in the Battle of Quebec. The Quebec and Port Royal expeditions were the only major New England offensives of King William&apos;s War; for the remainder of the war the English colonists were primarily engaged in defensive operations, skirmishes and retaliatory raids. The Iroquois Five Nations suffered from the weakness of their English allies. { Taylor, American Colonies: The Settling of North America, p.290 } In 1693 and 1696, the French and their Indian allies ravaged Iroquois towns and destroyed crops while New York colonists remained passive. After the English and French made peace in 1697, the Iroquois, now abandoned by the English colonists, remained at war with New France until 1701, { Taylor: American Colonies: The Settling of North America, p.291 } when a peace was agreed at Montreal between New France and a large number of Iroquois and other tribes. [ Hudson Bay Theatre ] The war also served as a backdrop for an ongoing economic war between French and English interests in Arctic North America. The Hudson&apos;s Bay Company had established trading outposts on James Bay and the southern reaches of Hudson Bay by the early 1680s. In a series of raids beginning with an expedition in 1686 organized by Governor Denonville, most of these outposts were taken by French raiders, primarily led by Pierre Le Moyne d&apos;Iberville. In one of the war&apos;s major naval battles, d&apos;Iberville, with a single ship, defeated three English ships in Hudson Bay. [ Aftermath ] The Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 ended the war between the two colonial powers, reverting the colonial borders to the status quo ante bellum. The peace did not last long, { Trafzer, Clifford E. As long as the grass shall grow and rivers flow a history of Native Americans. Fort Worth: Harcourt College, 2000 } and within five years, the colonies were embroiled in the next phase of the French and Indian Wars, Queen Anne&apos;s War. After their settlement with France in 1701, the Iroquois remained neutral in that conflict, never taking part in active hostilities against either side. Tensions remained high between the English and the Abenaki, who again fought with the French in Queen Anne&apos;s War. The Ryswick treaty was unsatisfactory to representatives of the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company. Since most of its trading posts in Hudson Bay had been lost to the French before the war began, the rule of status quo ante bellum meant that they remained under French control. The company recovered its territories at the negotiating table when the Treaty of Utrecht ended Queen Anne&apos;s War.
