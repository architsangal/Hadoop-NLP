Situated in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (since 1999), Kętrzyn was previously in Olsztyn Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Kętrzyn County. The city was named after Wojciech Kętrzyński in 1950. [ History ] The original inhabitants of the region were the Balt tribe of the Aesti, mentioned by Tacitus in his Germania (AD 98). The town, known in German as Rastenburg and in Polish as Rastembork, was established in 1329 in the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights and was granted town rights in 1357. In 1914 it was the scene of the battle of the Masurian Lakes during the Tannenberg campaign. Adolf Hitler &apos;s wartime military headquarters, the Wolfsschanze (Wolf&apos;s Lair), was located in the forest east of Rastenburg. The bunker was the setting for the failed 20 July plot against Hitler. In 1945 the area suffered devastation from both the retreating Germans and advancing Russians during the Vistula-Oder campaign. Some ruins of the Wolfsschanze remain. The town was occupied by the Red Army in 1945 near the end of World War II. After the war, it was taken over by Poland, as provided for by the Potsdam Conference. Its surviving German residents who had not evacuated were subsequently expelled westward and replaced with Poles. The town was renamed from Rastenburg to Rastembork in 1945, and later to Kętrzyn after the Polish historian and activist Wojciech Kętrzyński in 1950.
