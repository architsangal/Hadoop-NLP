The Minuteman had two innovations that gave it a long practical service life: a solid rocket booster, and a digital flight computer. This computer was one of the very first recognizably modern embedded system s. The solid rocket booster made the Minuteman faster to launch than earlier ICBMs, which used liquid rocket propellants. A reprogrammable inertial guidance system was a major risk in the original program. When first proposed, no one had built a digital computer that would fit in a missile. One program, the SM-64 Navaho, had already failed to produce such a system. A digital computer was essential to obtain the accuracy gains that kept this weapon effective throughout the Cold War. As the Defense Mapping Agency (now part of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency ) more accurately mapped mass concentration s in the Earth, the inertial guidance software could be updated and loaded into the missiles to make them ever more accurate by having them compensate for these sources of gravity. Another gain that persuaded program managers to accept the risk of the computer was that the computer could also be used to test the missile. This saved a large amount of weight in cables and connectors. [ Minuteman-I (LGM-30A/B or SM-80/HSM-80A) ] Autonetics D-17 guidance computer from a Minuteman I missile. See also W56 Warhead [ Deployment ] The LGM-30A Minuteman-I was first test-fired on 1 February 1961, [ http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/6555th/6555c3-8.htm The 6555th, Chapter III, Section 8, The MINUTEMAN Ballistic Missile Test Program Fas.org 2011-03-20 ] and entered into the Strategic Air Command ’s arsenal in 1962, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana; the “improved” LGM-30B became operational at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, and Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri in 1963. All 800 Minuteman-I missiles were delivered by June 1965. Each of the bases had 150 missiles emplaced. F.E. Warren AFB had 200 of the Minuteman 1B&apos;s. Malmstrom AFB had 150 of the Minuteman I and about five years later added 50 of the Minuteman II similar to those installed at Grand Forks AFB, ND. [ Guidance ] The Minuteman-I Autonetics D-17 flight computer used a rotating air bearing magnetic disk holding 2,560 “cold-stored” words in 20 tracks (write heads disabled after program fill) of 24 bits each and one alterable track of 128 words. The time for a D-17 disk revolution was 10 ms. The D-17 also used a number of short loops for faster access of intermediate results storage. The D-17 computational minor cycle was three disk revolutions or 30 ms. During that time all recurring computations were performed. For ground operations the inertial platform was aligned and gyro correction rates updated. During flight, filtered command outputs were sent each minor cycle to the engine nozzles. Unlike modern computers, which use descendants of that technology for secondary storage on hard disk, the disk was the active computer memory. The disk storage was considered hardened to radiation from nearby nuclear explosions, making it an ideal storage medium. To improve computational speed, the D-17 borrowed an instruction look-ahead feature from the Autonetics-built Field Artillery Data Computer ( M18 FADAC ) that permitted simple instruction execution every word time. The D-17B and the D-37C guidance and control computers were integral components of the Minuteman I and II missiles, respectively, which formed a part of the United States ICBM arsenal. The Minuteman III missiles, which use D-37D computers, complete the 1000 missile deployment of this system. The initial cost of these computers ranges from about $139,000 (D-37C) to $250,000 (D-17B). [ Minuteman-II (LGM-30F) ] See also W56 warhead The LGM-30F Minuteman-II was an improved version of the Minuteman-I missile. Development on the Minuteman-II began in 1962 as the Minuteman-Is entered the Strategic Air Command ’s nuclear force. Minuteman-II production and deployment began in 1965 and completed in 1967. It had an increased range, a greater throw weight and guidance system with better azimuthal coverage, providing military planners with better accuracy and a wider range of targets. Some missiles also carried penetration aids, allowing higher probability of kill against Moscow’s anti-ballistic missile system. The payload consisted of a single Mk-11C reentry vehicle containing a W56 nuclear warhead with a yield of 1.2 megatons of TNT (5 PJ ). The major new features provided by Minuteman-II were: An improved first-stage motor to increase reliability. A novel, single, fixed nozzle with liquid injection thrust vector control (TVC) on a larger second stage motor to increase missile range. Additional motor improvements to increase reliability. An improved guidance system, incorporating semiconductor integrated circuit s and miniaturized discrete electronic parts. Minuteman-II was the first program to make a major commitment to these new devices. Their use made possible multiple target selection, greater accuracy and reliability, a reduction in the overall size and weight of the guidance system, and an increase in the survivability of the guidance system in a nuclear environment. A penetration aids system to camouflage the warhead during its reentry into an enemy environment. In addition, the Mk-11C reentry vehicle incorporated stealth features to reduce its radar signature and make it more difficult to distinguish from decoys. A larger warhead in the reentry vehicle (RV) to increase kill probability. System modernization was concentrated on launch facilities and command and control facilities. This provided decreased reaction time and increased survivability when under nuclear attack. Final changes to the system were performed to increase compatibility with the expected LGM-118A Peacekeeper. These newer missiles were later deployed into modified Minuteman silos. The Minuteman-II program was economically important to the development of integrated circuit s. It was the first mass-produced system to use a computer constructed from integrated circuits (the Autonetics D-37C ), and used most of the production of such circuits from 1962 through 1967. [ August 2009 ] The Minuteman-II integrated circuits were diode-transistor logic and diode logic made by Texas Instruments. The other major customer of early integrated circuits was the Apollo Guidance Computer, which had similar weight and ruggedness constraints. The Apollo integrated circuits were resistor-transistor logic made by Fairchild Semiconductor. The Minuteman-II flight computer continued to use rotating magnetic disks for primary storage.

Current missiles carry a single warhead. } The LGM-30G Minuteman-III program started in 1966, and included several improvements over the previous versions. It was first deployed in 1970. Most modifications related to the final stage and reentry system (RS). The final (third) stage was improved with a new fluid-injected motor, giving finer control than the previous four-nozzle system.Performance improvements realized in Minuteman-III include increased flexibility in reentry vehicle (RV) and penetration aids deployment, increased survivability after a nuclear attack, and increased payload capacity. The missile retains a gimbal led inertial guidance system. Minuteman-III originally contained the following distinguishing features: [ Complete List of All U.S. Nuclear Weapons http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html 9 February 2011 ] [ February 2011 ] [ February 2011 ] An RS capable of deploying, in addition to the warheads, penetration aids such as chaff and decoy s. Minuteman-III still being a missile with three solid-fuel stages, introduced in the post-boost stage (“bus”) an additional liquid-fuel propulsion system rocket engine (PSRE) that is used to slightly adjust the trajectory. This enables to dispense decoys or – in the past case of MIRV – dispense individual RVs to separate targets. For the PSRE it uses the bipropellant Rocketdyne RS-14 engine. { The Hercules M57 third stage of Minuteman I &amp; II had thrust termination ports on the sides. These ports, when opened by detonation of shaped charges, reduced the chamber pressure so abruptly that the interior flame was blown out. This allowed a precisely timed termination of thrust for targeting accuracy. The larger Minuteman III third stage motor also has thrust termination ports although the final velocity is determined by PSRE. } { A fixed nozzle with a liquid injection TVC system on the new third-stage motor (similar to the second-stage Minuteman-II nozzle) additionally increased range. } { A flight computer (Autonetics } { D37D ) with larger disk memory and enhanced capability. } A Honeywell HDC-701 flight computer which employed non-destructive read out (NDRO) plated wire memory instead of rotating magnetic disk for primary storage was developed as a backup for the D37D, but was never adopted. The Guidance Replacement Program (GRP), initiated in 1993, replaced the disk-based D37D flight computer with a new one that uses radiation-resistant semiconductor RAM.

[ Guidance Replacement Program (GRP) ] The Guidance Replacement Program (GRP) replaces the NS20A Missile Guidance Set with the NS50A Missile Guidance Set. The newer system extends the service life of the Minuteman missile beyond the year 2030 by replacing aging parts and assemblies with current, high reliability technology while maintaining the current accuracy performance. The replacement program was completed 25 February 2008. [ Propulsion Replacement Program (PRP) ] Beginning in 1998 and continuing through 2009, { 2006 ATK press release on PRP } [ March 2011 ] the Propulsion Replacement Program extends the life and maintains the performance by replacing the old solid propellant boosters (downstages). [ Single Reentry Vehicle (SRV) ] The Single Reentry Vehicle (SRV) modification enabled the United States ICBM force to abide by the now-vacated START II treaty requirements by reconfiguring Minuteman-III missiles from three reentry vehicles down to one. Though it was eventually ratified by both parties, START II never entered into force and was essentially superseded by follow-on agreements such as SORT and New START, which do not limit MIRV capability. [ Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) ] Beginning in 2005, Mk-21/ W87 RVs from the deactivated Peacekeeper missile will be placed on the Minuteman-III force under the Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) program. The older W78 currently used is not equipped with important safety features. In addition to adding additional safety features into at least a portion of the future Minuteman-III force, the decision to transfer W87s onto the missile is based on two features that will improve the targeting capabilities of the weapon: more fuzing options which will allow for greater targeting flexibility and the most accurate reentry vehicle available which provides a greater probability of damage to the designated targets. The first SERV-modded Minuteman III was put on alert status at FE Warren AFB, Wyoming, in 2006. [ February 2008 ] [ Current and future deployment ] The Minuteman III missile entered service in 1970, with weapon systems upgrades included during the production run from 1970 to 1978 to increase accuracy and payload capacity. [ 2008 ], the USAF plans to operate it until at least 2030. The LGM-118A Peacekeeper (MX) ICBM, which was to have replaced the Minuteman, was retired in 2005 as part of START II.

The most recent launch was of an unarmed Minuteman III missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., which flew over the Pacific Ocean, 4,200 miles to a test range in the Marshall Islands, was in the early morning hours of February 27, 2012. Controllers observed an anomaly during the last portion of the mission, prompting them to terminate the test early for safety reasons. An anomaly is any unexpected event during the test. A launch analysis group was formed to investigate. The LAG included members from the 576th Flight Test Squadron, 30th Space Wing safety office, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center and Northrop Grumman, among other organizations. The current Minuteman III configuration has a reliable test and evaluation track record, with 22 of 24 fully successful flight tests. The last test to be terminated by mission controllers occurred in 1998. The 576th FLTS, at Vandenberg AFB, Calif., is responsible for planning, preparing, conducting and assessing ICBM ground and flight tests. Prior to the July test flight, the most recent was just before 6:40 AM on June 22, 2011. The unarmed missile traveled 4,200 miles meeting its target in the Marshall Islands. Defense officials will use the data collected from the launch to ensure the readiness and capability of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Fleet. Previous to that, the most recent launch from California&apos;s Vandenberg Air Force Base was on September 17, 2010, sent a single re-entry test vehicle into suborbital space on a flight that soared some 5,300 miles (8,530  km) across the Pacific Ocean, successfully landing on target about 200 miles (322  km) southwest of Guam.

The made for TV film The Day After also features the same footage, although the first stage of flight is completed via special effects. Terminator 3 uses computer generated images of Minuteman missiles launching from the Plains on Judgment Day. Also features in Eagle Strike, by Anthony Horowitz, in which fictional power-crazed multimillionaire Damian Cray orders their release from Air Force One. In the film WarGames a failed Minuteman launch simulation exercise caused by a conflicted launch control officer is the impetus for the conversion of the missiles to full automatic control by the computer system that Mathew Broderick&apos;s character later hacks into. [ Other roles ] [ Mobile Minuteman program ] While the silo-based Minuteman was in development, the United States Air Force released details about a rail-based counterpart. On October 12, 1959, details on the system, called the “Mobile Minuteman,” were released to the public. The system used the United States railroad network to help increase the system&apos;s survivability during nuclear attack. A performance test, code named Operation Big Star, was conducted from June 20 to August 27, 1960 at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The United States Air Force then activated the 4062nd Mobile Missile Wing on December 1, 1960. The wing was to have three missile train squadrons, each with ten trains and each train carrying three missiles (30 missiles per squadron). Lack of support by the Kennedy Administration killed the Mobile Minuteman Program; on December 1, 1961, the Department of Defense deleted the three mobile missile squadrons from its budget. The USAF officially deactivated the 4062nd Mobile Missile Wing on February 20, 1962. The dreams of a rail-based missile system were kept alive through the LGM-118A Peacekeeper Rail Garrison and the Soviet Union’s SS-24 Scalpel rail-based ICBM. { Air Mobile Feasibility Demonstration – 24 Oct 1974 } On 24 Oct 1974, the Space and Missile Systems Organization successfully conducted a Air Mobile Feasibility Test where a C-5A Galaxy aircraft air dropped the 86,000-pound missile from 20,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean. The missile descended to 8,000 feet before its rocket engine fired. The 10-second engine burn carried the missile to 20,000 feet again before it dropped into the ocean. The test proved the feasibility of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile from the air. Operational deployment was discarded due to engineering and security difficulties, though the capability was used as a negotiating point in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. { U.S. Air Force, Inside the AF.MIL Heritage section (Thursday, January 01, 1970 – Sunday, December 31, 1989) } { Marti and Sarigul-Klijn, A Study of Air Launch Methods for RLVs.

Specially designed rockets called BLUE SCOUT carried radio-transmitting payloads high above the continental United States, to relay messages to units within line-of-sight. In the event of a nuclear attack, ERCS payloads would relay preprogrammed messages giving the “go-order” to SAC units. BLUE SCOUT launch sites were located at Wisner, West Point and Tekamah, Nebraska. These locations were vital for ERCS effectiveness due to their centralized position in the US, within range of all missile complexes. Later ERCS configurations were placed on the top of modified Minuteman-II ICBMs (LGM-30Fs) under the control of the 510th Strategic Missile Squadron located at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The Minuteman ERCS may have been assigned the designation LEM-70A.

These missiles would be stored in silos, for launch upon short notice. The payload would be variable, and would have the ability to be replaced quickly. This would allow a surge capability in times of emergency. During the 1980s, surplus Minuteman missiles were used to power the Conestoga rocket produced by Space Services Inc. of America. It was the first privately developed rocket, but only saw three flights and was discontinued due to a lack of business. More recently, converted Minuteman missiles have been used to power the Minotaur line of rockets produced by Orbital Sciences. [ Ground and air launch targets ] L-3 Communications is currently using SR-19 SRBs, Minuteman II Second Stage Solid Rocket Boosters, as delivery vehicles for a range of different re-entry vehicles as targets for the THAAD and ASIP interceptor missile programs as well as radar testing.

The active inventory in FY 2009 is 450 missiles and 45 Missile Alert Facilities (MAF) [ Operational units ] The basic tactical unit of a Minuteman wing is the squadron, consisting of five flights. Each flight consists of ten unmanned launch facilities (LFs) which are remotely controlled by a manned launch control center (LCC). The five flights are interconnected and status from any LF may be monitored by any of the five LCCs. Each LF is located at least three nautical miles (5.6  km) from any LCC. Control does not extend outside the squadron (thus the 319th Missile Squadron ’s five LCCs cannot control the 320th Missile Squadron ’s 50 LFs even though they are part of the same Space Launch Wing).
