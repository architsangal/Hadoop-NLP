Óengus II led an army of Picts and Scots into battle against the Angles, led by Æthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland; Andrew then appeared to Óengus that night in a dream and assured him of victory. On the morning of battle white clouds, forming an X shape in the sky, were said to have appeared. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background is said to have been adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend. Although the earliest use as a national symbol can be traced to the seal of the Guardians of Scotland in 1286, [ http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location%3D10%26amp%3Bflagtype%3Dnational%26amp%3Bflagid%3D3 UK Flag Registry 2009-12-12 Flag Institute ] material evidence for the Saltire being used as a flag, as opposed to appearing on another object such as a seal, brooch or surcoat, dates from somewhat later. Certainly by 1542, a white saltire set against a blue background was depicted as being the flag of Scotland, although an even earlier example known as the &quot; Blue Blanket of the Trades of Edinburgh &quot;, reputedly made by Queen Margaret, wife of James III (1451–1488), also shows a white saltire on a blue field. However, in the case of the Blue Blanket of the Trades of Edinburgh, the Saltire is not the only emblem to be portrayed.

A further Scottish distinction from the UK flag days is that on Saint Andrew&apos;s Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only be flown where a building has more than one flagpole - the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position.
