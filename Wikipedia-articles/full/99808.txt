It is Mexico &apos;s busiest airport by both passenger traffic and aircraft movements and is the Latin America&apos;s second busiest airport by passenger traffic after Guarulhos Airport in São Paulo, Brazil and the busiest airport by aircraft movements. Although Juárez was not its official name for several decades, it was formally named after the 19th century president Benito Juárez in 2006, and is Mexico&apos;s main international and domestic gateway. The airport is owned by Grupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de México and operated by Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares, the government-owned corporation, who also operates 21 others airports through Mexico. In recent years Toluca Airport has become an alternate airport. This hot and high airport is served by 30 domestic and international airlines and offers direct flights to more than 100 destinations worldwide.It provides non-stop services from Mexico City to North America, Central America and Caribbean, South America, Europe and Asia ( Aeromexico is the only airline that flies to Asia from Mexico City). In 2011, the airport served 26,368,861 passengers a 9.28% increase compared to 2010. For the 12-month period ending April 30, 2012, the airport handled 27,842,489 passengers. In optimal conditions, and with the recent renovations and expansion projects completed, the Benito Juárez airport will be able to handle up to 32 million passengers per year. [ http://www.aicm.com.mx/acercadelaicm_en/AICMinforma/index.php?Publicacion%3D82 BEGIN SERVICE IN THE AICM T2: Aeromexico, Aeromexico Connect, COPA &amp; LAN (In Spanish) Mexico City International Airport January 25, 2010 ] As the main hub for Mexico&apos;s largest airline Aeroméxico and a secondary hub for its subsidiary Aeroméxico Connect, the airport has become a SkyTeam hub. It is also a hub for Aeromar, Interjet and a focus city for VivaAerobus and Volaris. [ Location ] The airport is 5  km. east from central Mexico City and is surrounded by the built-up areas of Gustavo A. Madero to the north and Venustiano Carranza to the west, south and east. As the airport is east Mexico City and its runways run southwest-northeast, and airliner&apos;s landing approach is usually directly over Mexico City. Therefore, there is an important overflying problem. [ History ] The airport first opened as Balbuena Military Airport with five runways. The first landing was on November 5, 1928 and regular service started a year later, but was officially inaugurated on May 15, 1931. Its first international route was to Los Angeles International Airport operated by Mexicana. President Miguel Alemán opened the terminal in 1952, thus becoming a commercial airport. In the 1970s, president Luis Echeverría closed three runways and gave that land to poor people in order to build their homes, leaving just two parallel runways. In 1980, the terminal was expanded to double its capacity, using a single large terminal rather than multiple terminals as in other airports. Ten years later in 1990, the mixed domestic/international gates were separated to increase the terminal&apos;s functionality, along with the separation of domestic and international check-in halls. In 2001, the east wing of the terminal (H-gates) was opened as a final call waiting area, mainly used by SkyTeam members. Because of the increasing traffic, president Vicente Fox announced the construction of a new, larger airport on 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) in the municipalities of Texcoco and San Salvador Atenco, but when local violent protests aroused, the new airport was cancelled. Instead, he launched a program called Expansion of Mexico City Airport to its Maximum Capacity in 2002 to increase the airport&apos;s capacity. The whole terminal was expanded and upgraded with new check-in halls, 13 more baggage claim belts, the construction of Departures and Arrivals floors, construction of several new taxiways and a whole new terminal opposite of the original, thus breaking the single terminal concept. The project was started with an initial investment of $200,000,000 MXP. Nevertheless, its final cost was $800,000,000 MXP. The original quasi-Terminal 2, which only housed Aeromar &apos;s operations in and out the airport was demolished, and the new Terminal 2 was built in less than two years. On November 15, 2007, Terminal 2 was opened, increasing the airport&apos;s capacity. All SkyTeam members moved their operations to the new terminal, except Air France and KLM. It was officially inaugurated on March 2008, once the new road accesses and taxiways were finished. Terminal 2 increased the airport&apos;s contact positions by 40%, and the operational capacity by 15%. [ Lack of capacity and slot restriction ] The airport as seen from an aircraft (2011). The airport has suffered from a lack of capacity due to restrictions for expansion, since it is located in a densely-populated area. Some analysts have reported that if the airport had grown at the same speed as demand, it would now serve over 40 million passengers annually. The main issue with the airport is the limitation that its two runways provide, since they are used at 97.3% of their maximum capacity, leaving a very short room for new operations into the airport. Only government, military, commercial and specially authorized aircraft are allowed to land at the airport. Private aircraft must use alternate airports, such as Lic. Adolfo Lopez Mateos International Airport in Toluca, General Mariano Matamoros Airport in Cuernavaca or Hermanos Serdán International Airport in Puebla. Even with the inauguration of the new Terminal 2, the airport would be ideally designed to serve around 18 million passengers per year, according to the international standards for runway and terminal usage. Instead, the airport will keep increasing the number of passengers from around 26 million passengers in 2008 at a rate of 16% per year. The Mexican Government laid the groundwork for a new airport to be built on the outskirts of Mexico City. After decades of planning a $2.3 billion dollar airport, peasant farmers who owned the property where the airport was proposed, took several hostages into their hands, refusing to give up their land at any cost.

[ Terminals ] Mexico City International Airport has two passenger terminals. Terminal 1 is separated from the other by the runways.

Although the terminal was intended to be served by all- SkyTeam member airlines, Air France and KLM decided to remain at Terminal 1. The airport houses a wide variety of lodging options for its passengers, including hotels inside Terminal 1 (the Hilton Hotel, the Camino Real and the Fiesta Inn), as well as a NH Hotel at Terminal 2.
