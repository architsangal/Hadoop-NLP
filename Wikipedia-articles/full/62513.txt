[ March 2010 ] { Stuttgart, Germany in action. } Model United Nations (also Model UN or MUN) is an academic simulation of the United Nations that aims to educate participants about current events, topics in international relations, diplomacy and the United Nations agenda. The participants role-play as diplomats representing a nation or NGO in a simulated session of an (committee) of the United Nations, such as the Security Council or the General Assembly. Participants research a country, take on roles as diplomats, investigate international issues, debate, deliberate, consult, and then develop solutions to world problems. More recently, simulation of other deliberative bodies, such as the United Nations National Security Council, has been included in Model United Nations, even if they are completely unrelated to the UN or international affairs as a whole.In general, the participants that the executive panel considers to be most contributing are given awards, such as &apos;Best Delegate award&apos;. [ Simulations ] { Old Dominion University Model United Nations in } { Norfolk, Virginia } { Turkish International Model United Nations in } { Istanbul, Turkey } During a conference, participants must employ a variety of communication and critical thinking skills in order to represent the policies of their country. These skills include public speaking, group communication, research, policy analysis, active listening, negotiating, conflict resolution, note taking, and technical writing. However, school delegation formats vary from region to region. Most Model UNs are simulations of a body in the United Nations system, such as: The General Assembly in both plenary form and within its functional committees Economic and Social Council and its specialized councils and agencies Security Council International Court of Justice United Nations Children&apos;s Fund United Nations Environment Programme United Nations Development Programme United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Human Rights Council International Monetary Fund Disarmament Committee United Nations High Commission for Refugees World Food Program World Health Organization World Trade Organization Many conferences simulate other IGOs including: European Union African Union Organization of American States The North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO Arab League Organisation of Islamic Cooperation South Asian Association For Regional Co-Operation Association of South East Asian Nations International Atomic Energy Agency { Tashkent, Uzbekistan } In addition, solely national organizations such as the United States National Security Council are often role played, with delegates role-playing specific people (e.g. the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense ) rather than representing countries. This may be taken one step further, having the delegate represent merely the interests of his or her office, or role-play a specific holder of the office (e.g. Hillary Clinton ). Such committees are typically &quot; crisis committees; &quot; that is to say, they do not begin with a fixed topic but rather are forced to deal with issues as they come up. A team of conference organizers (known as a crisis staff) develops a simulated event which acts as a catalyst for a crisis. The staff continually inform the committees of changing events on the ground, to which the committee must respond; in addition, individual delegates are typically allowed to take certain actions on their own, without committee approval, subject to the interpretation and agreement of the crisis staff. However, the correspondence between single-country and crisis committees are not perfect; for instance, the UN Security Council and some NATO bodies are typically run as crisis committees, and some national cabinets are fixed-topic committees. More unusual committees abound at the collegiate level; for instance, a college conference may simulate the Greco-Persian Wars via a committee of the Greek poleis, [ Historical Crisis Committee - Spartan Council Boston Model United Nations Conference BosMUN 2007 http://www.bosmun.org/bosmun.php?cat%3Dcom%26amp%3Bfocus%3Dcontent%26amp%3Bid%3D20 2008-04-04 ] have a committee simulating the National Football League &apos;s annual owners meeting, as held at George Mason University MUN in 2009, or even have a committee simulating President David Palmer &apos;s cabinet from the TV show 24, simulated by the University of Pennsylvania Model UN Conference in 2007. [ UPMUNC &gt; Committee UPMUNC Penn International Affairs Association 2007 http://www.upmunc.org/committees.html 2008-04-04 http://web.archive.org/web/20071013023540/http%3A//www.upmunc.org/committees.html 2007-10-13 ] [ http://www.upmunc.org/committees.html 20070701184005 ] Many conferences also run crisis simulations in which hypothetical real world factors are included in the simulation, including representatives from various groups such as member states thattopics for a crisis which can span all the committees of the conference. Model UNs are often run using basic parliamentary procedure. This allows all delegates to be active participants. Common activities in MUN involve giving speeches to the committee and writing resolutions concerning a given topic. Additionally, at the end of longer conferences, awards are commonly given to either individual delegates, delegations, or both. The judging of this varies. For example, American conferences on the West Coast, such as BMUN, give delegates points for every action they perform, which are added. At the end of the conference, awards are given to the highest point scorer. On the other hand, conferences on the East Coast such as the Harvard National Model United Nations, delegates are judged in a more holistic manner, but perhaps to the detriment of objectivity and transparency. Giving awards is less common at smaller conferences. In addition, many larger conferences do not give awards at all, feeling that competition detracts from the simulation experience. Model U.N Conferences are also held in countries like India where the scope and participation has expanded. [ Participants ] Negotiations at a Model United Nations conference (unmoderated caucus). Model United Nations groups are usually organized as either a club, conference, or class. A class can be a full semester class called &quot; Model United Nations &quot; or just one class period devoted to a short simulation; secondary schools may often incorporate the club of Model United Nations with the class of AP Comparative Government and Politics. Meanwhile, a conference is a school-wide, local, regional or international gathering of Model United Nations students who come together over a period between one and five days. There are various formats which are followed in Model United Nations Conferences and the most widely used model was developed by Shivish Soni and has been adopted by various conferences all over the world. An example of a one-day conference is a “scrimmage,” as created by Brian Ripley, Neal Carter and Andrea Grove. The key benefit of a one-day conference is the savings on lodging expenses “since it allows teams to travel to the host university without the need to pay for a hotel.” { Ripley, Brian, Neal Carter, and Andrea K. Grove. &quot; League of Our Own: Creating a Model United Nations Scrimmage Conference. &quot; Journal of Political Science Education. 5.1 (2009): 55-70. } In the early days of Model United Nations, participants were mostly students at select colleges in the United States of America. Today, Model United Nations has greatly matured and expanded. It is now practiced all over the world in classes, clubs, and conferences. Model United Nation participants are elementary, secondary, undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students. Recently even university alumni and professionals have taken part. Participants come from public and private schools and universities, and they live in city, suburban and rural areas. Over 90,000 students take part in Model United Nations Conferences in the United States. [ http://www.dgvn.de/pdf/MUN.pdf Aktuell: DGVN - Deutsche Gesellschaft für die Vereinten Nationen e.V Dgvn.de 2010-11-20 ] The United Nations Association of the United States of America (UNA-USA) has the most comprehensive calendar of Model United Nations conferences: the 2003-2004 edition lists 400+ conferences in 48 countries. { Model UN Calendar | UNAUSA.org } Some simulations are small, including members of only a single class. For example, 20 students can do a one-hour simulation of the (15-member) United Nations Security Council in their classroom. Other simulations can be very large, involving many committees and taking place over the span of several days. The majority of conferences generally involve anywhere from 50 to several hundred delegates, with most students living around that one region. The largest conferences can have thousands of participants from many different countries. Each simulation and conference varies greatly in number of participants and their involvement. The concept of Model United Nations has grown substantially all across the world, with various third-world and traditionally non-English speaking nations joining in. One example of this is Pakistan where a number of universities have a Model UN program. The Dominican Republic is the only country to have incorporated the concept of Model UN into its official high-school curriculum. This is in large part due to the efforts of the United Nations Association of the Dominican Republic, which has harbored substantial support from the government despite being completely apolitical. [ Position papers ] A position paper (sometimes known as a Policy Statement) is an essay that is written by participants of some models. It describes the detailed position of a certain country on a topic or issue that the writer will debate in his or her committee. Position papers are not always required, but certain conferences mandate that each delegate send his own before the opening. It is also known as the (Foreign) Policy Statement or (F)PS. { UNA-USA: Position Papers } [ Format ] Conferences have different format and styles for position papers. Nevertheless, UNA-USA established a format that has been adopted widely throughout the Model UN community. However, in Latin America the alternative TINK format, developed in Argentina, is used. In both formats most position papers consist of a heading with committee, topic, country and delegate information and body which explains in detail the position of the author&apos;s country.The position paper usually includes several pages outlining: Background of the Topic UN Involvement Country&apos;s Positions Possible Solution [ Purpose ] Position papers should explain an issue from their country&apos;s point of view. It is also good practice that they include statistics about the issue that would support the cause they defend. The paper would also try to convince the other countries of the committee to their view of the issue. It would have ways to solve the situation. { UNA-USA: How to write a position paper } Many conferences require delegates to submit a copy of their position paper, as a means to ensure that the delegates research important topics and construct strong and well-informed positions on those subjects, yet presentation is still a valuable component. [ History ] Model and civic simulation education are older than the United Nations. Records indicate that as early as the 1920s students in the United States of America were participating in collegiate simulations of the League of Nations, the predecessor to the United Nations. The modern day National Model United Nations in New York City and Harvard Model United Nations (HMUN) both began as simulations of the League of Nations in the 1920s. Though Harvard National Model United Nations (HNMUN), having been founded in 1955, often claims to be the world&apos;s oldest continuous College Model UN conference, the oldest continuous Collegiate Model UN conference is actually Model United Nations of the Far West, running annually since April 1951. { Model United Nations of the Far West: Archive } The world&apos;s oldest continuous High School Model UN conferences are the Indianapolis Model United Nations { http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/modelun/about } and the Berkeley Model United Nations, both founded in 1952. The National Model United Nations is one of the world&apos;s largest conferences with over 5,000 participants and is most unique with a part of the conference held at the United Nations in New York City. While National Model UN hosts opening ceremonies at the UN, UNA-USA is the only organization to host actual sessions in UN committee rooms. UNA-USA As the League of Nations was dismantled and the United Nations was born in 1945, simulations of the League of Nations were transformed into Model United Nations. Some conferences still perform historical simulations, however, including League of Nations crisis situations. These simulations now have grown to over 3000 and 2000 annual participants. The largest conference to date is THIMUN, attracting over 4,200 participants each year. [ Model UN Conferences ] Several Model UN conferences have been established in North America as well as worldwide. Well known MUNs in North America include NHSMUN (http://imuna.org/nhsmun/conference), Johns Hopkins University Model United Nations Conference (JHUMUNC) as well as Canadian High Schools Model United Nations, one of the largest Model UN conference in Western Canada. Both MUNs as well as several others are well established and accept delegates worldwide. Additionally, the National Model United Nations Conference held in New York City is the most revered conference for the Organization. During this conference, delegates in the General Assembly Plenary committees vote on their legislation inside the UN Headquarters in New York, which is intended to give conference participants a real-life feel for how policies are voted on within the United Nations system. In Europe there are many MUN conferences organized at different level. In continental Europe, two of the biggest (in terms of participants) are the Rome Model United Nations, held each March in Rome for college-level students (www.romemun.org), and the Paris International Model United Nations (http://pimun.fr/), annually held in May. Annual conferences are also held in the UK and Ireland. Wesley College, Dublin is the biggest conference in Ireland while in Northern Ireland, Methody College Belfast are the largest. Wallace High School (Northern Ireland) is going to be holding their first MUN Conference in March 2012 following several years of participating in the conferences held by other schools. In Scotland, the University of Edinburgh &apos;s ScotMUN is the largest, and oldest, Scottish MUN conference, commencing in February 2007. [ Languages ] While simulations are conducted in many different languages, there are six official languages of the UN. Generally, a simulation is conducted in the most spoken language or languages of the area in which the conference is being held. [ Support ] Model UN is supported by many organizations, private groups, non-governmental organizations, inter-governmental organizations, and national governments. United Nations Associations around the world and its international organization, the World Federation of United Nations Associations (WFUNA), have supported MUNs for decades. WFUNA organized the first collegiate MUN in China and works with MUNs all over the world. In the United States, the main support is given by UNA-USA &apos;s Global Classrooms program. { UNA-USA: Global Classrooms } Global Classrooms offers professional development workshops for educators and four curricula on peacekeeping, human rights, sustainable development, and the economics of globalization. UNA-Dominican Republic introduced MUN to the Dominican Republic and it is now a part of the national education curriculum. In Europe, support comes from THIMUN, which has affiliate conferences throughout Europe and around the world. MUN International has just created a new global membership association to help &quot; expand and increase MUN activities &quot;; the MUN International Network and has aided conferences in Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, and the US. Rotary International chapters around the world support MUNs, (e.g., the first international MUN in Hong Kong was organized and funded by three local Rotary Chapters.) [ March 2011 ] Many intergovernmental organizations also support MUN activities. The European Union published a policy paper just for Model UN participants. The Organization of American States oversaw the earliest Model OAS conferences. NATO often provides speakers and experts to Model NATO conferences. The United Nations Department of Public Information (UNDPI) supports Model United Nations in three key ways: the Model United Nations Discussion Area on the United Nations CyberSchoolBus the Public Inquiries Section in New York the United Nations of the United Nations conferences to use its rooms for committee space. The CyberSchoolBus is the on-line education program created by the United Nations. It features a Model United Nations discussion area and a list of Model United Nations experts who answer inquiries as well as providing research tools for country research. UNA-USA offers an online guide to the UN CyberSchoolBus. The Public Inquiries Section at UNHQ assists by helping Model United Nations groups to find speakers as well as arranging briefings at its New York offices. UNICs in Argentina, Mexico, Panama, and the UK have been extremely involved in Model United Nations activities, helping with research, Model United Nations support, and sometimes facilities. United Nations offices in The Hague, Netherlands; Nairobi, Kenya; Istanbul, Turkey; Vienna, Austria; and Geneva, Switzerland, also support Model United Nations and serve as hosts for at least one conference each year. The Organization of American States has been involved from the very beginning in the support to international civic simulations. North Atlantic Treaty Organization annually supports the Model NATO conference in Washington, DC with speakers, consultations, and advisers. Other IGOs provide research assistance to simulations, conferences, and students. Additionally, many UN missions and embassies support Model United Nations activities. Many mission and embassy websites have recently added sections created specifically for Model United Nations. Embassies and consulates will often invite groups to discuss country positions or send a speaker out to speak to Model United Nations clubs, classes, or conferences. The overall support of simulation education activities by the international community is increasing yearly. Additionally, national governments support or sponsor MUN programs. The US Department of State has been working in Washington, DC public schools for over fifteen years as well as providing speakers to MUN conferences around the world. In the Dominican Republic, MUN is part of the national education curriculum. Embassies and UN missions around the world have been providing consultation, speakers, and research documents for over forty years. Many have even reviewed students&apos; MUN resolutions for policy accuracy. [ MUN Vocabulary ] Abstain. During a vote on a substantive matter, delegates may abstain rather than vote yes or no. This generally signals that a state does not support the resolution being voted on, but does not oppose it enough to vote no. Adjourn. All UN or Model UN sessions end with a vote to adjourn. This means that the debate is suspended until the next meeting. This can be a short time (e.g., overnight) or a long time (until next year&apos;s conference). Agenda. The order in which the issues before a committee will be discussed. The first duty of a committee following the roll call is usually to set the agenda. Amendment. A change to a draft resolution the floor. Can be of two types: a &quot; friendly amendment &quot; is supported by the original draft resolution&apos;s sponsors, and is passed automatically, while an &quot; unfriendly amendment &quot; is not supported by the original sponsors and must be voted on by the committee as a whole. Background guide. A guide to a topic being discussed in a Model UN committee usually written by conference organizers and distributed to delegates before the conference. The starting point for any research before a Model UN conference. Binding. Having legal force in UN member states.

This is known as division of the question. Draft resolution. A document that seeks to fix the problems addressed by a Model UN committee. If passed by the committee, the draft resolution will become a resolution. Faculty adviser. The faculty member in charge of a Model UN team, class or club. Flow of debate. The order in which events proceed during a Model UN conference. See Flow of Debate chart. Gavel. The tool, shaped like a small wooden hammer, that the Chair uses to keep order within a Model UN committee. Many conferences give the gavel used in a committee to the delegate recognized by the dais as the best in that committee; therefore, the term is frequently used to refer to the award given to the best delegate, even in cases where no actual gavel is given. Formal debate. The &quot; standard &quot; type of debate at a Model UN conference, in which delegates speak for a certain time in an order based on a speakers&apos; list. Head delegate.
