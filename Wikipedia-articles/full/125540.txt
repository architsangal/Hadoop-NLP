As of the 2010 United States Census, the township population was 7,838. Chester Township is an affluent community in Morris County, about [ 40 mi km ] west of New York City that features Victorian style homes and palatial estates. Throughout the year there are craft fairs, Victorian house tours during the holiday season, jazz concerts in downtown park, and other community events. It was established by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 1, 1799, from portions of both Roxbury Township and Washington Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Additional territories were acquired from Randolph Township (in 1806) and Washington Township (1840 and 1853). Portions of the township were taken on April 3, 1930 to form Chester Borough, a separate municipality surrounded entirely by Chester Township. { &quot; The Story of New Jersey&apos;s Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968 &quot;, John P.

[ History ] The earliest records of individuals settling in the area date back to deeds dated in 1713, for properties located near a point where two Lenape Native American trails crossed at an area called Black River. With the arrival of the Rogerenes in 1730, the area developed as an agricultural community, producing applejack, flax and wool, as well as raising cattle. A burst of economic activity occurred starting in 1875 with the discovery of iron ore in the area, which led to the construction of dozens of mines, a blast furnace and many of the commercial and residential structures in the township date to that era. The discovery of far more abundant and productive mining sites in Minnesota &apos;s Mesabi Range ended that boom after nearly 15 years. Chester returned to its farming roots in the 20th Century.

Its structure includes four Councilmembers and a Mayor, all elected at large for three-year terms on a staggered basis, with one or two seats coming up for election each year. { 2005 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book, } { Rutgers University } { Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, April 2005, p. 110. } The candidates run on a partisan basis at regular primary and general election times. Independent candidates, having declared their intentions at primary time, run only in the general election. Chester Township&apos;s form of government features a strong mayor, who acts as the township&apos;s executive, overseeing the creation of a budget, preparing an annual financial report and the enforcement of state and local laws, and is responsible for hiring most township officials (with approval of the Council). The Council, which is the township&apos;s legislative body, selects one of its members to serve as president to preside when the mayor is not present. The mayor participates and votes in Council sessions and makes committee assignments to Councilmembers. The mayor and a member of the Council serve on the Planning Board. [ 2012 ], the members of the Chester Township Council are Mayor William A. Cogger, Matt Kass, Brian Murphy, Karen Powell and Daniel J. O&apos;Donnell. { Township Directory, Chester Township. Accessed January 20, 2012. } [ Merger discussion with Chester Borough ] In 2007, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine created incentives for municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants to combine with other communities. The goal is to reduce the overall cost of government and thereby offer some tax relief. &quot; New Jersey has 21 counties, 566 municipalities and 616 school districts, and property taxes average $6,800 per homeowner, or twice the national average. &quot; [ Van Dyke Meghan http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F20080501%2FCOMMUNITIES11%2F805010324 The Chesters look at forming one community 2008 Daily Record (Morristown) 2008-06-04 ] Chester Borough split from Chester Township in 1930 over the creation of sewer and water infrastructure in the more densely settled center of the municipality. The residents of the rural portions of the Township did not wish to financially support the construction and maintenance of a public sewer or water utility. Since that time rural Chester Township has relied upon individual private wells for water and septic systems for wastewater treatment while the Borough is primarily, although not entirely, served by public sewer and water. Concerns over the extension of utilities into the rural Township with the resultant potential for large scale growth served as an impediment to consolidation. The prohibition of utility extensions supported by the NJ State Plan and codified in the Highlands Water Protection Act, along with the development restrictions contained in the Highlands Act have lessened those concerns. Additionally, an aggressive land conservation program in the Township has resulted in over 40% of the [ 29 sqmi km2 on ] Township being placed into permanent preservation, further lessening worries about potential over-development. The two municipalities currently share a common K-8 school district, volunteer fire department, library, first aid squad and other municipal services. Governor Corzine&apos;s plan to reduce or eliminate state aid had residents considering recombining towns. The two mayors publicly endorsed a cost/benefit analysis of a merger. However, a merger vote planned for November 2, 2010, was delayed until 2011 due to Governor Christie&apos;s elimination of equalization funds that ensured some taxpayers do not pay more due to the merger.
