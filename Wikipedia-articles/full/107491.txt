El Centro is also the largest American city to lie entirely below sea level (- 50 feet). The city, located in the far southeastern corner of California, is conveniently near the major Southern California cities of San Diego and Los Angeles to its west as well as Phoenix and Tucson to its east. Founded in 1906 W. F. Holt and C.A. Barker purchased the land on which El Centro was eventually built for about forty dollars an acre and invested $100,000 in improvements. As one historian of Valley life put it, &quot; in only five months El Centro went from a barley field to a city... &quot;. It is home to retail, transportation, wholesale, and agricultural industries. There are also two international border crossings nearby for commercial and noncommercial vehicles. The city&apos;s population was 42,598 at the 2010 census, up from 37,835 at the 2000 census. As of February, 2012, the El Centro, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area ranked last, 372nd, with the highest unemployment rate among American cities, at 26.7%.

El Centro is located in the Imperial Valley (considered locally as synonymous with Imperial County ). The city is [ 50 ft m ] below sea level and the largest city in the United States below sea level. The Imperial Valley is in the Colorado Desert, an extension of the larger Sonoran Desert. The agriculture industry&apos;s demand for water is supplied by canals diverting water from the nearby Colorado River. The Salton Sea was created after a 1905 flood from the Colorado River. [ http://www.sunsetcities.com/hoover-dam/hoover-dam-history-1.html An Unbelievable Man-Made Disaster That Almost Could Not Be Undone August 3, 2009 ] In this region, the geology is dominated by the transition of the tectonic plate boundary from rift to fault. The southernmost strands of the San Andreas Fault connect the northern-most extensions of the East Pacific Rise. Consequently, the region is subject to earthquakes, and the crust is being stretched, resulting in a sinking of the terrain over time. [ History ] 100px Spanish explorer Melchor Díaz was one of the first Europeans to visit the area around El Centro and Imperial Valley in 1540. The explorer Juan Bautista de Anza also explored the area in 1776 [ http://www.solideas.com/DeAnza/TrailGuide/Imperial/index.html De Anza Trail August 3, 2009 ] (an elementary school in El Centro now bears his name). Years later, after the Mexican-American War, the northern half of the valley was annexed by the U.S., while the southern half remained under Mexican rule. Small scale settlement in natural aquifer areas occurred in the early 19th century (the present-day site of Mexicali ), but most permanent settlement ( Anglo Americans in the U.S. side, Mexicans in the other side) was after 1900. Originally part of San Diego County, the Imperial Valley was settled by farmers once water from the Colorado River was diverted via canals to irrigate the desert valley floor.

F. Holt and C.A. Barker. [ http://www.cityofelcentro.org/history.html History of the City of El Centro City of El Centro July 13, 2009 ] By 1907 Imperial County was incorporated into California and by then much of the valley was successfully irrigated. Before the town began, the railroad had established a station and named the place Cabarker. The name honored C.A. Barker, a friend of the landowner. The first post office in El Centro opened in 1905. [ 1416 ] The City of El Centro was incorporated on April 16, 1908. By 1910, the population of the city had reached 1,610. By 1920 it was 5,646. One reason for this rapid growth was El Centro&apos;s becoming the county seat of Imperial County. Population growth was slow, but accelerated in the 1930s, and again in the World War II era (1940s), despite that the city was hard hit by a 7.1 earthquake in July 1940.

El Centro had also become the location of the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) administrative offices. Agriculture has been an important industry within El Centro since the 1940s, because of its strategic location near rail lines and Highways 80 and 99 – more than 35 growers and shippers still operate in El Centro. However, by the early 1980s the two largest employment sectors in El Centro were Government and Wholesale/Retail Trade, reflecting El Centro&apos;s emerging role as a regional administrative and commercial center. [ Sites of interest ] [ Imperial Valley ] The nearby Algodones Dunes, the largest dune field in the US, draws thousands of visitors each year, mainly for off-road driving. The Salton Sea lies [ 30 mi km ] north of El Centro, but water sport enthusiasts head to the Colorado River, [ 50 mi km ] to the east near Yuma, Arizona. The El Centro Naval Air Facility [ 10 mi km ] to the west is home to the annual Blue Angels flight maneuvering event. Stark Field is home of a minor league baseball team El Centro Imperials of the Arizona Summer League. Mexico (the border city of Mexicali, Baja California ) is [ 10 mi km ] away, which offers big city amenities like museums, a zoo and a sports/convention center. [ Climate ] El Centro has an desert climate and is the southernmost desert city in the continental US with an elevation below sea-level. El Centro has over 350 days of sunshine and under [ 3 in mm ] of rain annually. Winter temperatures are in the mid 70s to mid 80s with over-night lows in the low 50s to mid 40s. During summer days, the dry, desert heat can push temperatures well into the 100s, while the nights stay in the low 80s to mid 70s. Average annual humidity is 24%. [ September 2009 ] Snow is almost totally unknown in the town, except for a very brief falling of sleet mixed with hail during a shower in December 1967.

Two nearby prisons and the U.S. Border Patrol provide employment; The Economist states that the prisons and border patrol were &quot; relatively untouched &quot; by the late-2000s recession. The El Centro area has many farming plots, where carrots, lettuce, and other crops are produced, and therefore the El Centro economy is subject to seasonal variations like other farming areas. Between November and March in winter periods, El Centro-area farmers harvest lettuce for $8–10 per hour. During March the harvest moves to the north and is no longer in El Centro; in previous eras farmers migrated, while in the first decade of the 21st century many collect unemployment benefits during the summer. { &quot; Benefits and the border. &quot; } { The Economist. August 20, 2009. Retrieved on September 12, 2009. } El Centro is surrounded by thousands of acres of farmland that has transformed the desert into one of the most productive farming regions in California with an annual crop production of over $1 billion. Agriculture is the largest industry in Imperial County and accounts for 48% of all employment. Being the commercial center of Imperial County, fifty percent of the jobs in the El Centro come from the service and retail sector. A recent growth in the interest of Imperial County as a filming location, has spurred growth in servicing this industry. Due to its desert environment and proximity to Los Angeles, California, movies are sometimes filmed in the sand dunes outside the agricultural portions of the Imperial County. These have included Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Stargate, The Scorpion King, and Into the Wild. Additionally, portions of the 2005 film Jarhead were filmed here because of its similarity to the desert terrain of Iraq. [ September 2009 ] [ El Centro during the late-2000s recession ] According to the Burea of Labor Statistics, as of April 30, 2009 the El Centro area had a 25.0% unemployment rate, the highest for a Metropolitan Area in the country.

The Economist stated that the city is not the &quot; centre of the Great Recession &quot; like the figure would appear to indicate. While El Centro has a seasonal farming economy, there is still a fixed &quot; baseline &quot; unemployment at 12%. Timothy Kelly, the head of the Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation, estimated that between 40,000 to 60,000 residents of Mexicali work in El Centro. The Economist added that there are likely many El Centro residents who work in Mexicali and collect unemployment benefits in El Centro; Ruben Duran, the city manager of El Centro, said that if the Mexicali jobs were factored into the employment rate, El Centro would have a normal employment rate. The manager of a job search agency called One Stop, said that about 3,000 people per month come into her agency; she says that some make a genuine effort to find jobs, while many do not have motivation to actually find a job, but to instead show proof that they tried to find a job. Kelly stated that unemployment fraud does not account for all of the issues with the El Centro area; he said that many residents have a lack of education and a lack of English language proficiency, so some of them cannot find jobs. The Economist added that the collapse of the housing market eliminated some construction jobs; the magazine countered that the scenario is true in many places in the United States. In December 2008 listed as No. 5 on Forbes.com&apos;s list of &quot; The Top 10 Places in America Where Homes are Losing their Value Fastest &quot; with 31.4% of homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.

In the winter residents race on nearby sand dunes using four wheel drive buggies. During the summer residents spend time indoors instead of outside. Spanish is a dominant language among residents and over the radio. Many area residents live in both the United States and Mexico and go across the border frequently.
