Cooperative Gale Ellsworth ] The Trailways Transportation System is an American group of 80 independent bus companies that have entered into a franchising agreement. The company is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia. { &quot; Home. &quot; Trailways Transportation System. Retrieved on June 30, 2010. &quot; 3554 Chain Bridge Road Suite 202 Fairfax VA 22030-2709. &quot; } [ History ] The company was founded February 5, 1936, by Burlington Transportation Company, Santa Fe Trails Transportation Company, Missouri-Pacific Stages, Safeway Lines, Inc., and Frank Martz Coach Company. The system originated with coast-to-coast service as the National Trailways Bus System (NTBS). Greyhound Lines had grown so quickly in the 1920s and 1930s that the Interstate Commerce Commission encouraged smaller independent operators to form the NTBS to provide competition. Unlike Greyhound, which centralized ownership, Trailways member companies became a formidable competitor while staying an association of almost 100 separate companies. In the 1950s, Morgan W. Walker, Sr., of Alexandria, Louisiana became head of the southern division of the company. He had entered the business on a small scale during World War I as the Interurban Transportation Company of Alexandria. { http://longrootshighbranches.blogspot.com/2006/08/morgan-wailes-walker.html } During the 1950s and 1960s, consolidation among bus operators resulted in four of the five original Trailways members becoming part of a new company, Continental Trailways, which eventually operated the majority of Trailways routes.

Walsh October 27, 1906 - November 5, 2008 http://trailways.com/Traveler_09.pdf Trailways Traveler January 6, 2012 ] Regular route bus ridership in the US declined steadily after WWII, despite minor gains during the 1973 and 1979 energy crises. By 1986, the Greyhound Bus Line had been spun off from the parent company to new owners, which resulted in Greyhound Lines becoming solely a bus transportation company. It was sold off to new owners headed by Fred Currey, a former executive with the largest member of the National Trailways Bus System. (The old Greyhound parent changed its name to Dial Corporation ) Under the new ownership in 1987, led by Currey, Greyhound Lines later acquired the former Continental Trailways company, the largest member of the rival National Trailways Bus System, effectively eliminating a large portion of bus competition.

Hayes http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/20/business/greyhound-in-deal-for-trailways.html The New York Times June 20, 1987 January 6, 2012 ] Although Greyhound negotiated cooperative schedules with Carolina Coach Company and Southeastern Trailways, two of the larger members of the Trailways system, many smaller carriers were effectively forced out of business. Most of the survivors diversified into charters and tours. [ Current Trailways members ] Today Trailways members are spread across North America. They provide charter bus service, bus tours and scheduled route services, with some members providing regular route service to areas not served by any other bus company on an interlining basis with Greyhound Lines, each other, and independent companies. Members also offer motorcoach charters and tours in competitive markets. [ List of members (current and former) ] For a complete list of members, please see the Trailways Companies page.
