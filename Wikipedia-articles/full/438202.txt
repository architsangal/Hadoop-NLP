He was one of the first serious collectors of manuscripts of works by Johann Sebastian Bach. Stafford Smith is best known for writing the music for &quot; The Anacreontic Song &quot;, which became the tune for the American patriotic song The Star-Spangled Banner following the War of 1812, and in 1931 was adopted as the national anthem of the United States of America. [ Life ] John Stafford Smith was baptised in Gloucester Cathedral, England on 30 March 1750, the son of Martin Smith, organist of Gloucester Cathedral from 1743-1782. He attended the Gloucester cathedral school where he became a boy-singer. He furthered his career as a choir boy at the Chapel Royal, London and also studied under the famous Dr. William Boyce. By the 1770s he had gained a reputation as a composer and organist. He was elected as a member of the select Anacreontic Society which boasted amongst its membership such persons as Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Henry Purcell. In the 1770s, Smith composed music for the society&apos;s constitutional song entitled &quot; To Anacreon in Heaven &quot; (The Anacreontic Song). The words were by Ralph Tomlinson (1744–1778) president of the society, and were inspired by the 6th-century BC Greek lyric poet, Anacreon, who wrote odes on the pleasures of love and wine. It was first published by The Vocal Magazine (London, 1778). { Raymond F. Glover The Hymnal 1982 companion, Volume 3, Church Publishing, Inc., 1990. } The song became popular in Britain and also America following the establishment of several Anacreontic Societies there.
