[ Blind pig Blind tiger ] [ Prohibition-era liquor establishments other uses Speakeasy (disambiguation) ] { 21 Club was a Prohibition-era speakeasy. } A speakeasy, also called a blind pig or blind tiger, is an establishment that illegally sells alcoholic beverage s. Such establishments came into prominence in the United States during the period known as Prohibition (1920 –1933, longer in some states). During this time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation ( bootlegging ) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States. [ Etymology ] The term &quot; speakeasy &quot; might have originated in Pennsylvania in 1888, when the Brooks High-License Act raised the state&apos;s fee for a saloon license from $50 to $500. The number of licensed bars promptly plummeted, but some bars continued to operate illegally. Kate Hester had run a saloon for years in McKeesport, just outside of Pittsburgh. She refused to pay the new license fee and wanted to keep from drawing attention to her illegal business. When her customers got too rowdy, she would hush them by whispering, &quot; Speak easy, boys! Speak easy! &quot; Unlicensed saloons in Pennsylvania are known as “speak-easies.” [ Cheney Sentinel 1889 1 ] { A newspaper in } { Cheney, Washington. } [ History ] Speakeasies were numerous and popular during the Prohibition years. Some of them were operated by people who were part of organized crime. Even though police and agents of the Bureau of Prohibition would often raid them and arrest their owners and patrons, they were so profitable that they continued to flourish. [ Blind pigs and blind tigers ] The term &quot; blind pig &quot; (or &quot; blind tiger &quot; ) originated in the United States in the 19th century; it was applied to lower-class establishments that sold alcoholic beverages illegally. The operator of an establishment (such as a saloon or bar) would charge customers to see an attraction (such as an animal) and then serve a &quot; complimentary &quot; alcoholic beverage, thus circumventing the law. &quot; In desperate cases it has to betake itself to the exhibition of Greenland pigs and other curious animals, charging 25 cents for a sight of the pig and throwing in a gin cocktail gratuitously. &quot; [ The Americans at Home: Pen-and-Ink Sketches of American Men, Manners, and Institutions MacRae David Volume II 1870 Edinburgh, Scotland 315 ] &quot; [They] are in a mysterious place called a ‘blind tiger,’ drinking the very bad whiskey for which Prohibition is indirectly responsible. &quot; [ Atlantic Monthly February, 1912 p. 206 ] A speakeasy was usually a higher-class establishment that offered food and entertainment. In large cities, some speakeasies even required a coat and tie for men, and evening dress for women. A blind pig was usually a dive where only beer and liquor were offered. Blind pigs continue to exist in the United States. Alcoholic beverages for on-site or off-site consumption are sold illegally from homes. [ Gangsters ] [ Gangster ] The era of Prohibition saw the growth of organized crime in the United States. Gangster s such as Dutch Schultz, Al Capone, and Lucky Luciano made fortunes by supplying illegal beer and liquor to speakeasies across the country. Some speakeasies were used as homes and offices by gangsters, who adopted an extravagant and easily identifiable lifestyle. Successful gangsters could be identified by their fashionable silk suits, expensive jewelry, and guns. [ Bootlegging ] [ Rum-running ] The term “bootlegging” came into use in the 1880s, when it referred to the practice of hiding flasks of illegal liquor inside boots. Bootlegging was widespread in the United States during Prohibition. Even though the Eighteenth Amendment prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, the law was widely disobeyed by the public and even by government officials. During Prohibition, the production of illegal beer and whiskey quickly expanded across the country. Bootleggers made large profits by distributing these products to speakeasies and other consumers. Bootlegging became an organized business run by crime families and gangsters, (e.g. Al Capone). [ Locations ] { Washington, DC. It offered liquor and gambling. } In many rural towns, small speakeasies and blind pigs were operated by local business owners as a way of making extra money. These family secrets were often kept even after Prohibition ended. For example, in 2007 secret underground rooms thought to have been a speakeasy were found by renovators on the grounds of the Cyber Cafe West in Binghamton, New York. { Sweeny, Caitlin. &quot; Remains of Speakeasy found in Cyber Cafe parking lot &quot; April 17, 2007.
