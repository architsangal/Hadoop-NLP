[ August 2011 ] [ http://www.sine.org.uk/local-area-data/population/ Parish Population Statistics 2010 NHS Population Estimates for Somerset Somerset County Council 8 February 2011 ] { Mendip } { Somerset } { South West England } { Somerton and Frome } { FROME } { BA11 } { BA } { 01373 } { ST775477 } Frome ( [ En-uk-Frome.ogg ˈ f r uː m ] [ FROOM &apos; ] ) is a town and civil parish in northeast Somerset, England. Located at the eastern end of the Mendip Hills, the town is built on uneven high ground, and centres around the River Frome. The town is approximately [ 13 mi km 0 ] south of Bath, [ 43 mi km 0 ] east of the county town, Taunton and [ 107 mi km 0 ] west of London. In the 2001 census, the population was given as 24,510. The town is in the Mendip district of Somerset and is part of the parliamentary constituency of Somerton and Frome. In April 2010 a large hoard of third-century Roman coin s was unearthed in a field near the town. From AD 950 to 1650, Frome was larger than Bath and originally grew due to the wool and cloth industry. It later diversified into metal-working and printing, although these have declined. The town grew substantially in the 20th century but still retains a very large number of listed buildings, and most of the centre falls within a conservation area. The town has road and rail transport links and acts as an economic centre for the surrounding area. It also provides a centre for cultural and sporting activities, including the annual Frome Festival and Frome Museum. A number of notable individuals were born in, or have lived in, the town. [ History ] The name Frome comes from the Old English word ffraw meaning fair, fine or brisk and describing the flow of the river. There is some limited evidence for Roman settlement of the area. The remains of a villa were found in the village of Whatley, [ 3 mi km 0 ] to the west of Frome. [ http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn%3D28414 Whatley Combe Villa Somerset Historic Environment Record 26 January 2010 8 July 2010 ] In April 2010, the Frome Hoard, one of the largest-ever hoards of Roman coins discovered in Britain, was found by a metal detectorist. The hoard of 52,500 coins dated from the third century AD and was found buried in a field near the town, in a jar [ 14 in cm ] below the surface. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10546960.stm Huge Roman coin find for hobbyist BBC News 8 July 2010 8 July 2010 ] The coins were excavated by archaeologists from the Portable Antiquities Scheme, [ http://finds.org.uk/blogs/fromehoard/ The Frome Hoard 8 July 2010 Anna Booth Portable Antiquities Scheme 8 July 2010 ] and some are now on display in the British Museum. The find was the subject of a BBC TV programme Digging for Britain in August 2010. A monastery built by St. Aldhelm in 685 is the earliest evidence of Saxon occupation of Frome. The Saxon kings appear to have used Frome as a base from which to hunt in Selwood Forest and in 934 a witenagemot was held there, indicating that Frome must already have been a significant settlement. One of the first English Kings, Eadred (son of Edward the Elder ), died in Frome on 23 November 955. [ http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_FromeText.pdf Frome Gathercole Clare Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey 2003 Somerset County Council 2 February 2010 ] At the time of the Domesday Survey, the manor was owned by King William, and was the principal settlement of the largest and wealthiest hundred in Somerset. Over the following years, parts of the original manor were spun off as distinct manors; for example, one was owned by the minster, later passing to the Abbey at Cirencester, which others were leased by the Crown to important families. By the 13th century, the Abbey had bought up some of the other manors (although it did let them out again) and was exploiting the profits from market and trade in the town. Local tradition asserts that Frome was a medieval borough, and the reeve of Frome is occasionally mentioned in documents after the reign of Edward I, but there is no direct evidence that Frome was a borough and no trace of any charter granted to it. However, Henry VII did grant a charter to Edmund Leversedge, then lord of the manor, giving him the right to hold fairs on 22 July and 21 September. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome.

Families of clothiers gradually came to be the principal landowners in the town, with the manor of Frome itself finally passing into the ownership of a cloth merchant in 1714. From 1665 to 1725 major expansion, including the building of a new artisans&apos; suburb to the west of Trinity Street, occurred. [ Havinden Michael The Somerset Landscape Hodder and Stoughton London The making of the English landscape 215 0-340-20116-9 ] Daniel Defoe remarked that the town had: [ &quot; so prodigiously increased within these last 20-30 years, that they have built a new church, and so many new streets of houses, and those houses are so full of inhabitants, that Frome is now reckoned to have more people in it than the city of Bath, and some say, than even Salisbury itself, and if their trade continues to increase for a few years more  ... it is likely to be one of the greatest and wealthiest towns in England &quot; Daniel Defoe 1720s ] On the 27 June 1685, the forces of the Duke of Monmouth camped in Frome, following their defeat in a skirmish with the Kings forces at Norton St Philip. Large numbers of his army deserted during the few days he stayed in the town before his eventual defeat at the Battle of Sedgemoor. Following the putting down of the Monmouth Rebellion, 12 men were hanged in the town. [ http://www.localhistories.org/frome.html A brief history of Frome Lambert Tim Local histories.org 30 September 2008 ] The former (Butler &amp; Tanner) Selwood Printing Works Poverty, the decline of the wool industry in the mid-18th century, increased industrialisation, and rising food prices led to some unrest amongst the inhabitants of Frome, and there were riots during the century. By 1791, the town was described in less flattering terms than those Defoe had used 70 years earlier. In the early 19th century, plans were developed to reinvigorate the town and once again elevate it to its former position as a more important town than Bath. These plans, the idea of a local businessman, Thomas Bunn, mostly failed to come to fruition, although some public buildings were erected and a wide new approach road to the town centre from the south was cut (named Bath Street after the landowner, Lord Bath of Longleat House). [ Goodall Rodney The buildings of Frome, 2nd Ed Frome society for local study Frome 149 0-9510157-5-3 ] Whilst wool remained an important part of the town&apos;s economy into the 19th (and even 20th) centuries, other industries were established in the town. A bell-foundry started in 1684 by William Cockey grew to be a major producer of components for the developing gas industry and employer of 800 people. The J W Singer brass foundry and bronze-casting works, [ http://www.fromemuseum.org/singer1.htm JW Singer &amp; Sons Frome Museum 6 February 2010 ] was a major employer and produced bronze statues. [ http://www.jwsinger.com/ J W Singer website ] John Webb Singer was born in Frome and established his art metal work foundry in 1851. They made brass ornaments for local churches and became known through the Oxford Movement within the Church of England which lead to increasing demand for church ornaments. [ http://www.fromemuseum.org/singer2.htm The Founder Frome Museum 6 February 2010 ] In addition to church ornaments the firm developed the facilities and expertise to create large statues. One of the first statues cast was a copy of General Gordon riding a camel. The firm was also responsible for the bronze statue of Boudica with her daughters in her war chariot (furnished with scythes after the Persian fashion), which was commissioned by Prince Albert and executed by Thomas Thornycroft. It was not cast in bronze until 1902, 17 years after Thornycrofts death, and now stands next to Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament, London. { Mark Stocker, ‘Thornycroft, Thomas (1815–1885)’, } { Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, } { Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 online edn, Oct 2006, accessed 2 January 2009 } The statue of Lady Justice on the dome above the Old Bailey was executed by the British sculptor, F. W. Pomeroy and cast by Singers. She holds a sword in her right hand and a pair of weighing scales in her left. The statue is popularly supposed to show blind Justice; however, the figure is not blindfolded. The statue of Alfred the Great at Winchester was a further commission. [ http://www.fromemuseum.org/singer3.htm Statuary Frome Museum 6 February 2010 ] The statues from Singers have also been exported around the world. [ http://www.fromemuseum.org/singer6.htm List of Singers Statues Frome Museum 6 February 2010 ] Printing was another major industry, with the Butler and Tanner printworks being set up in the middle of the century. Brewing was also a source of employment. During the 20th century the old wool industry in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. [ Bush Robin Somerset: The complete Guide Dovecote Press Wimborne 101–104 1-874336-27-X ] As a result the population fell and in the 1930s it was slightly smaller than it had been in the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.

The town was not represented in Parliament until given one member in the House of Commons by the Reform Act of 1832. Separate representation was abolished for the 1950 general election, with Frome itself being transferred to the Wells division, whilst most of the remainder of the constituency formed the bulk of the new Somerset North constituency. Further changes took place for the 1983 general election when the current Somerton and Frome constituency was created. The current representative is Liberal Democrat MP David Heath CBE, although the seat has been contested by the Conservatives. During the general election of 2010, in which 74% of those eligible turned out to vote, David Heath achieved a relatively slim majority of 1,817 votes (3% of the total), [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/e07.stm Somerton and Frome BBC 10 November 2010 ] Frome is within the South West England European Parliamentary constituency which elects six MEPs using the d&apos;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. The town has a new National Health Service community hospital, operated by Somerset Primary Care Trust, located on the site of the former Showground at Fromefield. { Frome Community Hospital, Somerset PCT } The new hospital was opened in 2008, replacing the former Frome Victoria Hospital in Park Road which had been in use since 1901.

[ Belham Peter The Making of Frome Frome society for local study 1985 2 ] Frome is unevenly built on high ground above the River Frome, which is crossed by the 16th century town bridge in the town centre. The town centre is approximately [ 65 m ft 0 ] above sea-level, whilst the outer parts of the town are between [ 90 m ft 0 ] and [ 135 m ft 0 ] above sea-level. { Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale map, grid reference ST775475 } The main areas of the town are (approximately clockwise from the north-west): Innox Hill, Welshmill, Packsaddle, Fromefield, Stonebridge, Clink, Berkley Down, Easthill, Wallbridge, The Mount, Keyford and Lower Keyford, Marston Gate, The Butts, Critchill, Trinity, and Gould&apos;s Ground. Although the royal forest of Selwood no longer exists, the nearby countryside is still richly wooded, for example on the Longleat, Maiden Bradley and Stourhead estates. To the west of the town, on the edge of the Mendip Hills, there are large active limestone quarries, such as Whatley Quarry and Merehead Quarry, along with disused quarries. The working quarries are served by a dedicated railway line which branches off the main line at Frome, passes through the town centre and out through the Welshmill and Spring Gardens areas in the north-west quadrant of the town. Along with the rest of South West England, Frome has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10  °C (50  °F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1  °C (34  °F) and 2  °C (36  °F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21  °C (70  °F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK. Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower cloud s and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900  mm (31–35  in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.

[ http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id%3D266218 The Angel Hotel Images of England English Heritage 17 February 2011 ] [ Landmarks ] The older parts of Frome  – for example, around Sheppard&apos;s Barton and Catherine Hill  – are picturesque, containing an outstanding collection of late 17th and 18th century small houses. The Trinity area, which was built in the latter half of the 17th century and first half of the 18th century, is a fine (and rare) example of early industrial housing. Over 300 houses were built between 1660 and 1756 in a very unusual early example of a planned grid-pattern. Although about half the area was demolished in the 1960s under a Slum Clearance Order, before its historical importance was realised, the remainder was saved and was restored at a cost of £4 million between 1980 and 1984. Also in this area is the elaborate former Selwood Printing Works. Catherine Hill Stoney Street, which leads into Catherine Hill, is a steep, cobbled road climbing out of the town centre. Also in the centre of the town, Cheap Street contains buildings dating to the 16th and 17th centuries, and has a stream running down the middle, fed by the spring at St John&apos;s Church. Cheap Street has never been used for vehicular traffic and its layout is based on land plots dating to approximately 1500. Despite a fire in 1923, the buildings have remained substantially unchanged since 1830, apart from shop-frontages. The town bridge, which was originally built in the 14th century, was rebuilt in the 16th century and widened in the 18th century, [ The Bridge http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id%3D266052 Images of England English Heritage 22 November 2011 ] at which time houses were built on it. The Tourist Information Centre in Justice Lane is contained within a circular dye-house, known to have been in existence by 1813, one of two surviving in the town (the other is in Willow Vale). It was restored in 1994. In the 1990s and first few years of the 21st century, Frome benefited from considerable investment in the restoration of its historic buildings through the English Heritage Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme and the National Lottery Townscape Heritage Initiative. [ http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Documents/Regeneration/frome%20blt%20lowres.pdf Historic Building Repair in Frome Mendip District Council 7 7 February 2010 ] Frome has over 500 listed buildings, three of which (including the parish church) are grade I listed. [ Grade I Listed Buildings ] { The Blue House, a grade I listed building } The Blue House, located adjacent to the town bridge, is a Grade I listed building and was formerly the Bluecoat School and Almshouses, so named due to the colour of the school uniforms. Built in 1726 at a cost of £1,401 8s 9d, it replaced a previous almshouse dating from 1461 and rebuilt in 1621. The Blue House provided a home for twenty widow women and schooling for twenty boys. The front of the building is adorned by two statues, one of a man and the other a woman, indicating the building&apos;s dual purpose. They are colloquially known as &quot; Billy Ball &quot; and &quot; Nancy Guy &quot;. The building&apos;s role as a school came to an end in 1921, and it now provides studio and one-bedroom flats for seventeen elderly residents. [ The Blue House Images of England http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id%3D266245 29 August 2007 ] Rook Lane Chapel was a noncomformist chapel built between 1705 and 1707 by James Pope. The chapel had a gallery around three sides, and the centre of the ceiling was domed and supported by two tuscan column s. Rook Lane ceased to be used as a chapel in 1968 and there followed twenty-five years of neglect. In the early 1990s the building was compulsorily purchased by Somerset County Council and transferred to the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust who carried out repairs and restorations. In 2001 it was converted by a firm of architects, the ground floor becoming a community hall and arts centre, managed by Rook Lane Arts Trust, and the galleried upper floor becoming offices for the architectural firm, NVB Architects. { Rook Lane Chapel 1707-2007: a short history (2007). Rook Lane Arts Trust. } [ Rook Lane Chapel Images of England http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id%3D266042 29 August 2007 ] [ Tunnels ] Frome is reputed to have one or more systems of tunnels beneath the streets of the older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example, in the wall at the top of Stony Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses. Their purpose and full extent remains unknown, but they have been under investigation in recent years by at least one local group and a documentary has been made. [ http://www.frometunnels.co.uk/ Introduction Frome Tunnels Project 21 June 2009 ] [ Religious sites ] [ Anglican churches ] { Church of St John the Baptist, Frome } The parish church of St John the Baptist, was built between the late 12th century and early 15th century replacing a Saxon building that had stood since 685. The building was in very poor condition by the mid-19th century, and major restoration work  – almost a complete rebuilding  – was carried out in the 1860s, at a cost of almost £40,000. One of the more unusual pieces of work carried out was the construction of the Via Crucis, which is thought to be unique in an Anglican church. Another unusual feature are the carved roundels above the nave arcades depicting parables and miracles, which were added later in the century. [ Parish Church of St John the Baptist Images of England http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id%3D266035 31 December 2006 ] Outside the east end of the church is the tomb of Bishop Thomas Ken.

The third Anglican Church, Holy Trinity, was built in 1837-38 by Henry Goodridge in the style of Commissioners&apos; Gothic. [ http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id%3D266325 Holy Trinity Images of England English Heritage 6 February 2010 ] It is unusual in that the altar is at the west end due to the position in which the church was built. The stained glass windows are near-contemporary copies of windows designed by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. Finally, St Mary&apos;s at Innox Hill was built in 1863, by C.E. Giles, [ http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id%3D266191 Church of St Mary Images of England English Heritage 6 February 2010 ] as another Chapel of Ease to St John&apos;s. It is small with a decorated sanctuary ceiling. [ Irvingite ] In 1853, Irvingite Catholics (Catholic-Apostolic) began worshiping in a building in the West End until the church was closed. [ Roman Catholic ] The Roman Catholic church began in Frome after the building of a temporary church in Park Road in 1928, and a new church, St Catharine&apos;s Catholic Church, was finally built on the site in 1967 and 1968. [ Non-conformist churches ] Rook Lane Chapel As well as Rook Lane Chapel, there were other non-conformist religious houses in Frome. In 1773, a split in the congregation of Rook Lane led to the establishment of another Zion Congregational Church in Whittox Lane. This building was replaced in 1810, and was extended in 1888 (a separate, octagonal school room with a conical roof having been built on the grounds in 1875). A Quaker Meeting House existed in Sheppards Barton, now South Parade, from 1675 to 1856. The original building was replaced around 1730 with a simple unadorned stone building comprising a single meeting room with wrought iron gallery above. The building became a school, the town library, Red Cross centre and, since 1999, the offices of a software company. The present chapel-like appearance was created in a 1993 refurbishment by the Red Cross. Baptists had also been worshiping in the town since 1669, and had two churches. One was built in Sheppards Barton (now South Parade) in 1708. This was demolished and replaced by a new building in 1850, which was itself closed in 2001. Part of this building was converted to residential use but the main church, with a baptism pool, remains disused. A second Baptist Church was built in Badcox Lane (now Catherine Street) in 1711. It was replaced with a new building in 1813, which was embellished with a Doric portico in 1845. [ http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id%3D266101 Badcox Chapel Images of England English Heritage 6 February 2010 ] It closed in 1962 (later serving as a library, before being converted into flats in the 1980s). The Methodist s built themselves a church in 1812 at Gorehedge, which is still in use (after considerable additions in 1863, restoration in 1871 and major internal rearrangement in the 1980s). [ http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id%3D266356 Wesleyan Methodist Church Images of England English Heritage 6 February 2010 ] Sun Street Chapel was erected by the Primitive Methodist s in 1834, and closed in 1982, although it is now being used by another religious group. There is another Methodist church on Portway, built in 1910. Finally, there is a Dissenters&apos; Cemetery with Chapel at Vallis Road, which was founded in 1851 by Frome&apos;s &apos;Free Churches&apos;, mainly Baptist, Congregational and Methodist and has been the site of over 6,000 burials.

A continuation of this line, which previously linked Frome to Radstock, is now the route of National Cycle Route 24, otherwise known as the Colliers Way. Frome is served by a by-pass road, the A361, which passes around the southern and eastern edges of the town, while the A362 passes through the centre of the town from north-west to south-east.
