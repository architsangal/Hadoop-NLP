The goal was to create an off-road vehicle that could handle like a sports car. The team, with over 300 people, was led by Klaus-Gerhard Wolpert, and based in Porsche main base Weissach im Tal, Germany. The result of the joint project is that the Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7 share the Touareg&apos;s Volkswagen Group PL71 platform, although there are styling, equipment, and technical differences between those vehicles. The Volkswagen Touareg is built in Bratislava, Slovakia. The manufacturing plant shares production with Touareg-cousins, the Porsche Cayenne, and the Audi Q7. Due to the demand, and the exchange rates of euro s against the US dollar, as well as different pricing and environmental policies in the USA, the V6 and V8 engine variants make up most of Volkswagen&apos;s American Touareg offering. However, a limited number of the V10 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine s were available in the 2004 model year (before being pulled for environmental reasons). They were brought back to the United States for the 2006 as a &quot; Tier I emissions concept (43 state emissions) &quot;.
