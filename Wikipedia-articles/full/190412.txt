Other properties in County Durham included Dinsdale Park and Low Dinsdale Manor. [ October 2009 ] John George Lambton, Lord Durham, was born April 12, 1797, in London. After attending Eton he joined the army in 1809 as a cornet in the 10th Hussars, but resigned in 1811. From 1813 to 1828 he was a member of Parliament. [ Political career ] Durham was first elected to Parliament for County Durham in the general election of 1812, a seat he held until 1828, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Durham, of the City of Durham and of Lambton Castle in the County Palatine of Durham. [ 18433 18 January 1828 122 ] When his father-in-law Lord Grey (see below) became prime minister in 1830, Durham was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Lord Privy Seal. [ 18748 23 November 1830 2450 ] In this capacity he helped draft the Reform Bill of 1832. Lord Durham resigned from cabinet in 1833. [ October 2009 ] Later the same year he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Lambton and Earl of Durham. [ 19030 15 March 1833 523 ] Between 1835 he served as Ambassador to Russia. While in Russia he was invested as a Knight of the Order of Alexander Nevsky, of the Order of St. Andrew and of the Order of St. Anna. In 1837 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. [ Canada ] Lord Durham was sent to The Canadas in 1837 { It was during Durham&apos;s trip to the Canadas aboard the } { Hastings that he experienced one of the first recorded cases of } { synesthesia.

Britain and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History, Pages 819-820. ACB-CLIO, 2005. ISBN 978-1-85109-431-8 } His detailed and famous Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839) recommended a modified form of responsible government and a legislative union of Upper Canada, Lower Canada and the Maritime Provinces. Lord Durham has been lauded in English Canadian history for his recommendation to introduce responsible government. This was implemented and by 1848 Canada was a functioning democracy, as it has been ever since. He is less well considered for his idea of merging Upper and Lower Canada into one colony, since this was proposed with the express end of trying to encourage the extinction of the French language and culture through intermingling with the lesser English population. Although in the end the policy of assimilation failed during the Union (1840–1867) and after, in practice, the Act of Union prevented the granting of responsible government to the French Canadian people (as a majority in Lower Canada). [ October 2009 ] As soon as 1842, Lord Durham&apos;s intended policy of assimilation faced setbacks, as Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine &apos;s party in the House managed to force de facto re-establishment of French as a language of Parliament. Once responsible government was achieved (1848), French Canadians in Canada East succeeded by voting as a bloc in ensuring that they were powerfully represented in any cabinet, especially as the politics of Canada West was highly factional. The resulting deadlock between Canada East and West led to a movement for federal rather than unitary government, which resulted in the creation of confederation, a federal state of Canada, incorporating New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, in 1867. [ October 2009 ] [ Family ] Lord Durham was twice married. He married as his first wife Lady Harriet, daughter of George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley, in 1812. They had three daughters, who all predeceased him. After Lady Harriet&apos;s death in July 1815 he married secondly Lady Louisa, daughter of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, in 1816. They had two sons and three daughters. Lord Durham died at Cowes on the Isle of Wight in July 1840, aged 48, and was succeeded by his eldest and only surviving son, George. The Countess of Durham only survived her husband by a year and died in November 1841. [ Legacy ] Lambton County, Ontario, Lambton, Toronto, Lambton, Québec, and Durham Heights and Cape Lambton (both in the southern tip of Banks Island in the Northwest Territories ) are named in his honour. The Penshaw Monument in County Durham, on a hill west of Sunderland, was built in his honour.
