[ Jackalopes ] Jackalope statue in Douglas In 1932, the jackalope legend in the United States was attributed by the New York Times to Douglas Herrick (1920 –2003) of Douglas, and thus the city was named the &quot; Home of the Jackalope &quot; by the state of Wyoming in 1985. Douglas has issued Jackalope Hunting licenses to tourists. The tags are good for hunting during official Jackalope season, which occurs for only one day, June 31. According to the Douglas Chamber of Commerce, a 1930s hunting trip for jackrabbits led to the idea of a Jackalope. Herrick and his brother had studied taxidermy by mail order as teenagers. When the brothers returned from a hunting trip, Herrick tossed a jackrabbit carcass into the taxidermy shop, which rested beside a pair of deer antler s. The accidental combination of animal forms sparked Douglas Herrick&apos;s idea for a jackalope.
