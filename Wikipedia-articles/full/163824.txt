{ Bełżec extermination camp await instructions } The Porajmos ( Romani : [ [ˈpɔʁmɔs] ] [ January 2012 ] ) (also Porrajmos or Pharrajimos, literally, devouring or destruction in some dialects of the Romani language ) was the attempt made by Nazi Germany, the Independent State of Croatia, Horthy&apos;s Hungary and their allies to exterminate the Romani people of Europe during World War II. Under Hitler &apos;s rule, both Roma and Jews were defined as &quot; enemies of the race-based state &quot; by the Nuremberg laws; the two groups were targeted by similar policies and persecution, culminating in the near annihilation of both populations within Nazi-occupied countries. { Janos Barsony, “Facts and Debates: The Roma Holocaust,” in Pharrajimos: The Fate of the Roma During the Holocaust, ed. Janos Barsony and Agnes Daroczi (New York: International Debate Education Association, 2008), 1. } Because Eastern Europe an Romani communities were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos was not well documented. Estimates of the death toll of Romanies in World War II range from 220,000 to 1,500,000.

[ Using the term ] The term porajmos was introduced into the literature by Ian Hancock, in the early 1990s. { Matras, Yaron. 2004. A conflict of paradigms: review article. In: Romani Studies 5. Vol. 14, No. 2. P.195 } According to Hancock, the term was invented by a Kalderash Rom during an informal conversation in 1993 where several people were discussing what to call the Holocaust in Romani. Of the several suggestions, Hancock found this one particularly appropriate. { On the interpretation of a word: Porrajmos as Holocaust – Ian Hancock } The term is used mostly by activists and is unknown to most Roma, including relatives of the victims and survivors. Some Russian and Balkan Romani activists protest against using the word porajmos. { http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddr3tfjd_0cpggdpfw } In various dialects, &quot; porajmos &quot; is synonymous with poravipe which means &quot; violation &quot; and &quot; rape &quot;, a term which some Roma consider to be offensive. Balkan Romani activists prefer the term Samudaripen ( &quot; mass killing &quot; ), { http://dosta.org/?q=node/37 } first introduced by linguist Marcel Courthiade. Hancock dismisses this word, arguing that it does not conform to Romani language morphology. Some Ruska Roma activists offer the emotive term Kali Traš ( &quot; Black Fear &quot; ). { http://romanykultury.info/discussion/discussion.php?row=3 } Another alternative that has been used is Berša Bibahtale ( &quot; The Unhappy Years &quot; ). Lastly, adapted borrowings such as Holokosto, Holokausto etc. are also occasionally used in the Romani language. Linguistically, the term is composed of the verb root porrav- and the abstract-forming nominal ending -imos. This ending is of the Vlax Romani dialect, whereas other varieties generally use -ibe(n) or -ipe(n). { Norbert Boretzky and Birgit Igla. Kommentierter Dialektatlas des Romani. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag 2004. Teil 1: Vergleich der Dialekte. } For the verb itself, the most commonly given meaning is &quot; to open/stretch wide &quot; or &quot; to rip open &quot;, whereas the meaning &quot; to open up the mouth, devour &quot; occurs in fewer varieties. { See e.g. http://romani.uni-graz.at/romlex/lex.xml } [ Recognition and remembrance ] { Asperg - 22 May 1940 } The German government paid war reparations to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, but not to the Romani. There were &quot; never any consultations at Nuremberg or any other international conference as to whether the Sinti and Roma were entitled like the Jews to reparations.” { Wolfgang Wippermann, “Compensation withheld: The denial of reparations to the Sinti and Roma,” in The Gypsies during the Second World War: The Final Chapter, ed. Donald Kenrick (Hertfordshire: University of Hertfordshire Press, 2006), 171. } The Interior Ministry of Wuerttemberg argued that &quot; Gypsies [were] persecuted under the Nazis not for any racial reason but because of an asocial and criminal record. &quot; { Martin Gilbert, Second World War, page 734, Guild Publishing, London, 1989 } When on trial for his leadership of Einsatzgruppen in the USSR, Otto Ohlendorf cited the massacres of Romanis during the Thirty Years War as a historical precedent. { Martin Gilbert, Second World War, page 735, Guild Publishing, London, 1989 } West Germany recognised the genocide of the Roma in 1982, [ Zoltan D.

Duna (University of Minnesota): &apos;&apos;Gypsies: A Persecuted Race. Gypsies in Nazi Germany&apos;&apos; } The American historian Sybil Milton wrote several articles arguing that the Porajmos deserved recognition as part of the Holocaust. { e.g. Nazi Policies Toward Roma and Sinti, 1933-1945, Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society, 1992; Chapter 5, &quot; The Holocaust: the Gypsies &quot; in Century of genocide: critical essays and eyewitness accounts By Samuel Totten, William S. Parsons, Israel W. Charny, Routledge, Oxford, 2004 } In Switzerland, a committee of experts investigated the policy of the Swiss government during the Porajmos. { &apos;&apos;Roma, Sinti und Jenische. Schweizerische Zigeunerpolitik zur Zeit des Nationalsozialismus&apos;&apos;. (English: &quot; Roma, Sinti and Jenische. Swiss Gypsy-politics at the time of National Socialism &quot; ) (PDF). } Formal recognition and commemoration of the Roma persecution by the Nazis is practically difficult due to the lack of significant collective memory and documentation of the Porajmos among the Roma, a consequence both of their oral traditions and their illiteracy, heightened by widespread poverty and discrimination that forces some Roma out of state schools. One UNESCO report put the illiteracy rate among the Roma in Romania at 30 percent, as opposed to the near universal literacy of the Romanian public as a whole. In a 2011 investigation of the state of the Roma in Europe today, Ben Judah, a Policy Fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, traveled to Romania and Transylvania. Nico Fortuna, a sociologist and Roma activist, explained the distinction between Jewish collective memory of the Shoah and the Roma experience: &lt; p &gt; There is a difference between the Jewish and Roma deportees...The Jews were shocked and can remember the year, date and time it happened. The Roma shrugged it off. They said, &apos;Of course I was deported. I&apos;m Roma; these things happen to a Roma.&apos; The Roma mentality is different from the Jewish mentality. For example, a Roma came to me and asked, &apos;Why do you care so much about these deportations? Your family was not deported.&apos; I went, &apos;I care as a Roma&apos; and the guy said back, &apos;I do not care because my family were brave, proud Roma that were not deported.&apos; For the Jews it was a total and everyone knew this - from bankers to pawnbrokers. For the Roma it was selective and not comprehensive. The Roma were only exterminated in a few parts of Europe such as Poland, the Netherlands, Germany and France. In Romania and much of the Balkans, only nomadic Roma and social outcast Roma were deported. This matters and has an impact on the Roma mentality. [ Ben Judah http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/08/Roma.html Invisible Roma July/August 2011 Moment Magazine June 30, 2011 ] Ian Hancock has also observed a reluctance among Roma to acknowledge their victimization by the Third Reich. The Roma &quot; are traditionally not disposed to keeping alive the terrible memories from their history - nostalgia is a luxury for others. &quot; [ Symi Rom-Rymer http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2011/08/Roma.html Roma in the Holocaust July/August 2011 Moment Magazine June 30, 2011 ] The impact of the illiteracy, the lack of social institutions and the rampant discrimination faced by Roma in Europe today have produced a people who, according to Fortuna, lack a &quot; national consciousness...and historical memory of the Holocaust because there is no Roma elite. &quot; [ Acts of commemoration ] { Rome (Italy) in memory of Romani people who died in extermination camps. } The first memorial commemorating victims of the Romani Holocaust was erected on May 8, 1956, in the Polish village of Szczurowa commemorating the Szczurowa massacre. Since 1996, a Gypsy Caravan Memorial is crossing the main remembrance sites in Poland, from Tarnów via Auschwitz, Szczurowa and Borzęcin Dolny, gathering the Gypsies and well-wishers in the remembrance of the Porajmos. { The Porajmos in Roma Memory in Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. } Several museums dedicate a part of their permanent exhibition to that memory, like the Museum of Romani Culture in Czech Republic and the Ethnographic Museum in Tarnów. However some political organisations still try to block the building up of memorials near former concentration camps, as shows the debate around Lety and Hodonin in Czech Republic. On October 23, 2007, Romanian President Traian Băsescu publicly apologized for his nation&apos;s role in the Porajmos, the first time a Romanian leader has done so. He called for the Porajmos to be taught in schools, stating that, &quot; We must tell our children that six decades ago children like them were sent by the Romanian state to die of hunger and cold &quot;. Part of his apology was in the Romani language. Băsescu also awarded three Porajmos survivors with an Order for Faithful Services. { Romanian Leader Apologizes to Gypsies, } { USA Today } Before recognizing Romania&apos;s role in the Porajmos, Traian Băsescu was widely quoted after an incident on May 19, 2007, in which he insulted a journalist by calling her a &quot; stinky gypsy. &quot; The president subsequently apologized. { Violence against Roma: Romania } { Human Rights First } On January 27, 2011, Zoni Weisz became the first Roma guest of honour at Germany&apos;s official Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony.

Educated Gypsy, Univ of Hertfordshire Press, 2010, p.256 } [ History ] [ Romani discrimination prior to 1933 ] [ The emergence of race pseudo-science and industrialization ] In the late 19th century, the emergence of race pseudo-science and state-sponsored modernization sparked Germany’s anti-Romani policy. During this time, “the concept of race was systematically employed to explain social phenomena.” { Herbert Heuss, “German policies of Gypsy persecution (1870-1945),” in From “Race Science” to the Camps: The Gypsies during the Second World War, by Karola Fings, Herbert Heuss and Frank Sparing (Hertfordshire: University of Hertfordshire Press, 1997), 19. } Scientific racial analysis and Social Darwinism linked social difference to racial difference. This approach validated the idea that different races were not variations of a single species, but instead were of different biological origin. The emergence of race pseudo-science established a scientifically-backed racial hierarchy, which othered minority groups on the basis of biology. In addition to race science, the end of the 19th century was a period of state-sponsored modernization in Germany. Industrial development altered many aspects of society. Most notably, this period shifted social norms of work and life. For Roma, this meant a denial of their traditional way of being. Janos Barsony notes that “industrial development devalued their services as craftsmen, resulting in the disintegration of their communities and social marginalization.” { Janos Barsony, “Facts and Debates: The Roma Holocaust,” in Pharrajimos: The Fate of the Roma During the Holocaust, ed. Janos Barsony and Agnes Daroczi (New York: International Debate Education Association, 2008), 7. } [ Persecution under the German Empire and Weimar Republic ] The developments of racial pseudo-science and modernization resulted in anti-Romani state interventions, carried out by both the German Empire and Weimar Republic. In 1899, the Information Services on Gypsies by the Security Police was created in the Imperial Police Headquarters in Munich. Its purpose was to keep records (identification cards, fingerprints, photographs, etc.) and continuous surveillance on the Roma community. Roma in the Weimar Republic were forbidden from entering public swimming pools, parks, and other recreational areas, and depicted throughout Germany and Europe as criminals and spies. By 1926, this ‘racial panic’ was transmitted into law. The Law for the Fight Against Gypsies, Vagrants and the Workshy was enforced in Bavaria. It stipulated that groups identified as ‘Gypsies’ avoid all travel to the region. Those already living in the area were to “be keep under control so that there [was] no longer anything to fear from them with regard to safety in the land.” { Report on the Bavarian Landtag 1925/6, III Tagung; Gesetz- und Verordnungsblatt fur den Freistaat Bayern, Nr. 17, 22.7.1926. as cited in Herbert Heuss, “German policies of Gypsy persecution (1870-1945),” in From “Race Science” to the Camps: The Gypsies during the Second World War, by Karola Fings, Herbert Heuss and Frank Sparing (Hertfordshire: University of Hertfordshire Press, 1997), 24. } Herbet Heuss notes that “[t]his Bavarian law became the model for other German states and even for neighbouring countries.” { Herbert Heuss, “German policies of Gypsy persecution (1870-1945),” in From “Race Science” to the Camps: The Gypsies during the Second World War, by Karola Fings, Herbert Heuss and Frank Sparing (Hertfordshire: University of Hertfordshire Press, 1997), 24. } The demand for Roma to settle in a specific region was often the focus of anti-Gypsy policy of German Empire and Weimar Republic. Once settled, communities were concentrated and isolated in one area within a town or city. { Frank Sparing, “The Gypsy Camps: The creation, character and meaning of an instrument for the persecution of Sinti and Romanies under National Socialism,” in From “Race Science” to the Camps: The Gypsies during the Second World War, by Karola Fings, Herbert Heuss and Frank Sparing (Hertfordshire: University of Hertfordshire Press, 1997), 39-40. } This process facilitated state-run surveillance practices and ‘crime prevention.’ Public policy increasingly targeted the Roma on the explicit basis of race following the Law for the Fight Against Gypsies, Vagrants and the Workshy. In 1927, legislation was passed in Prussia that required all Roma to carry identity cards. Eight thousand Roma were processed this way and subjected to mandatory fingerprinting and photographing. { Ian Hancock, “Gypsy History in Germany and Neighbouring Lands: A Chronology Leading to the Holocaust and Beyond,” in The Gypsies of Eastern Europe, ed by David Crowe and John Kolsti (Armonk: M.E. Sharpe, 1991), pg. 14. } Two years later, the focus became ever more explicit. In 1929, the German state of Hussen proposed the Law for the Fight Against the Gypsy Menace. The same year the Centre for the Fight Against Gypsies in Germany was opened. This body enforced restrictions on travel for undocumented Roma and &quot; allowed for the arbitrary arrest and detention of gypsies as a means of crime prevention.” { Erin Jessee, &quot; Nazi Atrocities: The Genocide of the Roma/Sinti &quot; (lecture, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, February 3, 2010). } Legislation prior to Hitler’s rise to power was propelled by a rhetoric of racism. Policy based on the premise of “fighting crime” was redirected to “fighting a people.” Targeted groups were no longer determined by juridical grounds. Instead, they were victims of racialized policy. [ Aryan racial purity ] [ Racial policy of Nazi Germany ] For centuries, Romani tribes were subject to antiziganist persecution and humiliation in Europe. { Ian Hancock, We are the Romani People. Hatfield: University of Hertfordshire Press, 2002, (ISBN 1 902806 19 0) } They were stigma tized as habitual criminals, social misfits, and vagabonds. Given the Nazi predilection for “ racial purity ”, the Roma were among their first victims. However, In the early days of Third Reich, the Romanies posed a problem for Hitler’s racial ideologues: the Romani language is one of the Indo-Aryan languages, originating in northern India. Nazi anthropologists realized that Romanies migrated into Europe from India and were thus descendants of the Aryan occupants of the subcontinent, thought at the time to have invaded India from Europe. In other words, the Romanies are native speakers of an Aryan language. Huttenbach argues that the Nazis planned to eliminate the Romanis, one way or another, from as early as 1933; they announced on July 14, 1933, the goal of preventing lebensunwertes Leben (see Life unworthy of life ) from reproducing. { Gisela Bock, Racism and Sexism in Nazi Germany, p.408 in The Gypsies of Eastern Europe,ME Sharpe Inc, London, p.46 } The Department of Racial Hygiene and Population Biology began to experiment on Romanis to reach criteria for their racial classification. { Gabrielle Tyrnauer, The Fate of the Gypsies During the Holocaust, p.19 in The Gypsies of Eastern Europe,ME Sharpe Inc, London, p.47 } Nazi racialist Hans F. K. Günther added a socioeconomic component to the theory of racial purity. While he conceded that the Romanies were, in fact, descended from Aryans, they were of poorer classes that had mingled with the various “inferior” races they encountered during their wanderings. This, he explained, accounted for their extreme poverty and nomadic lifestyle. While he conceded that there were some groups that were &quot; purely Aryan &quot;, most Romanies posed a threat to Aryan homogeneity because of their racial mingling. { Robert Ritter } To study the problem further, the Nazis established the Racial Hygiene and Demographic Biology Research Unit (Rassenhygienische und Bevölkerungsbiologische Forschungsstelle, Department L3 of the Reich Department of Health) in 1936. Headed by Dr. Robert Ritter and his assistant Eva Justin, the body was mandated to conduct an in-depth study of the &quot; Gypsy question (Zigeunerfrage) &quot; and to provide data required for formulating a new Reich &quot; Gypsy law &quot;. After extensive fieldwork in the spring of 1936, consisting of interviews and medical examinations to investigate genealogical and genetic data, it was determined that most Romanies posed a danger to German racial purity and should be eliminated. No decision was made regarding the remainder (about 10 percent of the total Romani population of Europe), primarily Sinti and Lalleri tribes living in Germany, though several suggestions were made. At one point Heinrich Himmler even suggested the establishment of a remote reservation, where &quot; pure Gypsies &quot; could continue their nomadic lifestyle unhindered. According to him:...The aim of measures taken by the State to defend the homogeneity of the German nation must be the physical separation of Gypsydom from the German nation, the prevention of miscegenation, and finally, the regulation of the way of life of pure and part-Gypsies. Nine representatives of the Romani community in Germany were asked to compile lists of pure-blooded Romanies to be saved from extermination. However, these lists were often ignored and some who were named on them were still sent to concentration camps. { Helen Fein, Accounting for Genocide, Free Press, 1979, pp.140-1 } [ Loss of citizenship ] On November 14, 1935, The Law for the &quot; Protection of Blood and Honour &quot;, a supplementary extension to the Nuremberg Laws, was passed. This law forbade Aryans to marry non-Aryans. Criteria defining who is Romani were exactly twice as strict as those defining any other group. The second Nuremberg law, The Reich Citizenship Law, stripped citizenship from &quot; non-Aryans &quot;. Blacks [ http://www.ushmm.org/outreach/nlawchr.htm Nuremberg Laws: Nazi Racial Policy 1935 US Holocaust Memorial Museum ] and Romanies, like Jews, lost their right to vote on March 7, 1936. [ Extermination ] { The Brown Triangle. Romani prisoners in German concentration camps such as Auschwitz were forced to wear the inverted triangle on their prison uniforms to distinguish them from other inmates. The Holocaust History Museum } { ‎ } The persecution of the Roma by the Third Reich government began as early as 1936 when they began to be transferred to municipal internment camps on the outskirts of cities, a prelude to their deportation to extermination camps. Notable internment and concentration camps include Dachau, Dieselstrasse, Marzahn (which evolved from a municipal internment camp) and Vennhausen.The Society for Threatened Peoples estimates the casualties at 277,100. { http://www.gfbv.it/3dossier/sinti-rom/de/rom-de.html#r5 } Martin Gilbert estimates a total of more than 220,000 of the 700,000 Romani in Europe, including 15,000 (mainly from the Soviet Union) in Mauthausen in January–May 1945.

[ August 2007 ] Ghetto diarist Emmanuel Ringelblum speculated that Romanies were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto because the Germans wanted:...to toss into the Ghetto everything that is characteristically dirty, shabby, bizarre, of which one ought to be frightened, and which anyway has to be destroyed. { Yad Vashem, &quot; Ringelblum’s Diary &quot; } Initially there was disagreement about how to solve the &quot; Gypsy Question. &quot; In late 1939 and early 1940, Hans Frank, the General Governor of occupied Poland, refused to accept the 30,000 German and Austrian Roma which were to be deported. For his &quot; ethnic reservation, &quot; Heinrich Himmler &quot; lobbied to save a handful of pure-blooded Roma, &quot; but was opposed by Martin Bormann, who favored deportation for all Roma. The debate ended in 1942 when Himmler signed the order marking the beginning of the mass deportations to Auschwitz. The Nazi persecution of Roma varied from country to country and region to region. In France, between 3,000 and 6,000 Roma were deported to Dachau, Ravensbrück, Buchenwald, and other camps. Further east, in the Balkan states and the Soviet Union, the Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, travelled from village to village massacring the inhabitants where they lived and typically leaving little to no records of the number of Roma killed in this way. In few cases, significant documentary evidence of mass murder was generated.

On December 16, 1942, Himmler ordered that the Romani candidates for extermination should be deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. To the Romani people of Europe, this order was equivalent to the January 20 decision of that same year, made at the Wannsee Conference, at which Nazi bureaucrats decided on the “ Final Solution ” to the “Jewish problem”. Himmler then ordered, on November 15, 1943, that Romanies and &quot; part-Romanies &quot; were to be put “on the same level as Jews and placed in concentration camps.” [ Gilbert, Martin The Second World War: A Complete History Owl Books Clearwater, Fla 2004 474 0-8050-7623-9 ] Sybil Milton has speculated that Hitler was involved in the decision to deport all Romanies to Auschwitz, as Himmler gave the order six days after meeting with Hitler and Himmler had prepared for the meeting a report on the subject Fuehrer: Aufstellung wer sind Zigeuner. { Sybil Milton, The Holocaust: the Gypsies, p.172 in Century of Genocide 3rd edition, ed. Samuel Totten &amp; William S. Parsons, Routledge, Oxford, 2009. } Organized Jewish resistance occurred in nearly every large ghetto and concentration camp ( Auschwitz, Sobibor, Treblinka, Ravensbrück, Buchenwald, among many others), and the Roma themselves similarly attempted to resist the Nazis&apos; extermination. In Auschwitz, in May 1944, SS guards attempted to liquidate the gypsy family camp and were &quot; met with unexpected resistance - the Roma fought back with crude weapons - and retreated. &quot; However, a few months later the SS succeeded in liquidating the camp, and ultimately 20,000 Roma were murdered in the camp. [ Persecution in other Axis countries ] Romanies were also victims of the puppet regimes that cooperated with the Third Reich during the war, especially the notorious Ustaše regime in Croatia. In Jasenovac concentration camp, along with Serbs and Jews, tens of thousands of Romanies were killed. Yad Vashem estimates that the Porajmos was most intense in Yugoslavia, where around 90,000 Romanies were killed. The Ustashe government also deported around 26,000; { Jasenovac, at the } { Jewish Virtual Library. } Serbian Romanies are parties to the pending Class action suit against the Vatican Bank and others currently pending in U.S. Federal Court seeking return of wartime loot. { Vatican Bank Claims } The governments of some Nazi German allies, namely Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, also contributed to the Nazi plan of Romani extermination, but this was implemented on a smaller scale and most Romani in these countries survived, unlike those in Ustaše Croatia or in areas directly ruled by Nazi Germany (such as Poland ). The Hungarian Arrow Cross government deported between 28,000 and 33,000 Romanies out of a population estimated between 70,000 and 100,000. [ Crowe, David M.

Instead, resident Roma were deported to Romanian-run concentration camps in occupied Transnistria [ http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId%3D10005219 Genocide of European Roma (Gypsies), 1939-1945 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Holocaust Encyclopedia Aug 9, 2011 ]. Of the estimated 25,000 Romani inmates of these camps,11,000 died. { &apos;&apos;The report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania&apos;&apos; ( } { PDF ), from } { Yad Vashem } According to eyewitness Mrs. de Wiek, Anne Frank, a notable Jewish Holocaust victim is recorded as having witnessed the prelude to the murder of Romani children at Auschwitz: &quot; I can still see her standing at the door and looking down the camp street as a herd of naked gypsy girls were driven by, to the crematory, and Anne watched them going and cried. &quot; { &quot; Anne as a child &quot; —see part about Mrs. de Wiek and &quot; gypsy girls &quot; } In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Romani internees were sent to the Lety and Hodonín concentration camps before being transferred to Auschwitz-Birkenau for gassing. What makes the Lety camp unique is that it was staffed by Czech guards, who could be even more brutal than the Germans, as testified in Paul Polansky ’s book Black Silence. The genocide was so thorough that the vast majority of Romani in the Czech Republic today are actually descended from migrants from Slovakia who moved there during the post-war years in Czechoslovakia. In Nazi-occupied France, between 16,000 and 18,000 were killed. The small Romani population in Denmark was not subjected to mass killings by the Nazi occupiers, but classified as simply &quot; asocial &quot;. Angus Fraser attributes this to &quot; doubts over ethnic demarcations within the travelling population &quot;. { Angus Fraser, The Gypsies, page 267, Blackwell, Oxford, 1992 } The Romanis of Greece were taken hostage and prepared for deportation to Auschwitz, but were saved by appeals from the Archbishop of Athens and the Greek Prime Minister. { Angus Fraser, The Gypsies, page 268, Blackwell, Oxford, 1992 } [ Estimated losses by country ] The following figures are from The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust. { Niewyk, Donald L.

One day, Mengele took them away. When they returned, they were in a terrible state: they had been sewn together, back to back, like Siamese twins. Their wounds were infected and oozing pus.
