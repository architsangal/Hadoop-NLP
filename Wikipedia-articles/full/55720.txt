Lau ] Mulan was the first of three features produced primarily at the Disney animation studio at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida. [ http://disney.go.com/princess/html/main_iframe.html Disney Princess Official Homepage 2007-09-08 SWF The Walt Disney Company ] Development for the film began in 1994, when a number of artistic supervisors were sent to China to receive artistic and cultural inspiration. Mulan was well received by critics and the public, grossing $304 million, earning Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, and winning several Annie Awards including Best Animated Feature. A 2005 direct-to-video sequel, Mulan II, followed. Mulan is set in China during the Han Dynasty. The film&apos;s protagonist, Fa Mulan, is the only daughter of aged warrior Fa Zhou. She impersonates a man and takes her father&apos;s place during a general conscription to counter a fictitious Hun invasion led by Shan Yu. Along with her guardian dragon Mushu, her captain, Li Shang, a lucky cricket, &quot; Cri-kee, &quot; and her companions, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, she battles the invading Hun army. [ Plot ] The Huns, led by the ruthless Shan Yu, invade Han China, forcing the Chinese emperor to command a general mobilization. Each family is given a conscription notice, requiring one man from each family to join the Chinese army. When Fa Mulan hears that her elderly father Fa Zhou, the only man in their family, is forced to join the army, she decides to stand in his place, disguising herself as a young man named &quot; Ping &quot;. Fa Zhou learns that Mulan has taken his place and prays to his family&apos;s ancestors, who order their &quot; Great Stone Dragon &quot; to protect her. The ancestors are unaware that the statue of Great Stone Dragon failed to come to life, and that Mushu, a small dragon is the one to go and protect Mulan. Mulan is initially misguided by Mushu in how to behave like a man, and starts a ruckus at the training camp. However, under command of Li Shang, she and her new friends at the camp, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po, become skilled warriors. Mushu, desiring to see Mulan succeed, creates a fake order from Li Shang&apos;s father, General Li, ordering Li Shang to follow them into the mountains. They arrive at a burnt-out village and discover that General Li and his forces have been wiped out by the Huns. As they solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns, but use of a cannon by Mulan buries most of the enemy forces in an avalanche. Mulan is slashed by Shan Yu in his rage at her wiping out his army during the battle, and she is forced to reveal her deception after receiving medical attention. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Li Shang decides to spare her life by leaving her on the mountain as the rest of the army departs for the Imperial City to report the news of the Huns&apos; demise. However, the avalanche failed to eliminate all the enemies, as Mulan catches sight of a small number of surviving Huns, including Shan Yu, making their way to the City intent on capturing the Emperor. In the Imperial City, Mulan attempts to warn Li Shang about Shan Yu, but he refuses to listen. The Huns appear and capture the Emperor, locking themselves inside the palace. With Mulan&apos;s help, Li Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines and are able to enter the palace and defeat Shan Yu&apos;s men. As Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun onto the roof where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan&apos;s instructions, Mushu fires a bundle of fireworks rockets at Shan Yu on her signal and kills him. Mulan is praised by the Emperor and the people of China, who all bow to her as an unprecedented honor. While she accepts the Emperor&apos;s crest and Shan Yu&apos;s sword as gifts, she politely declines his offer to be his advisor and asks to return to her family. She returns home and presents these gifts to her father, but he is more overjoyed to have his daughter back safely. Li Shang, who has become enamored with Mulan, soon arrives under the guise of returning her helmet, but accepts the family&apos;s invitation for dinner. Earlier in the film, Mulan was declared unfit for marriage, but this is not the case with her budding romance with Li Shang. Mushu is granted a position as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration. [ Production ] Mulan originally began as a short, straight-to-video film titled &quot; China Doll &quot; about an oppressed and miserable Chinese girl who is whisked away by a British Prince Charming to happiness in the West. Then Disney consultant and children&apos;s book author Robert D. San Souci suggested making a movie of the Chinese poem, &quot; The Song of Fa Mu Lan &quot; and Disney combined the two separate projects. { Brown, Corie and Laura Shapiro. &quot; Woman Warrior. &quot; } { Newsweek. Jun 8 1998. Vol 131: p. 64-66. } Development for Mulan began in 1994, after the production team sent a select group of artistic supervisors to China for three weeks to take photographs and drawings of local landmarks for inspiration; and to soak up local culture.

[ &quot; Art Design &quot; MulanDVD Documentary film Walt Disney Home Entertainment 2004 ] To create 2,000 Hun soldiers during the Huns&apos; attack sequence, the production team developed a crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A variant of the program called Dynasty was used in the final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar &apos;s photorealistic RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is a panoramic film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.

[ Chinese culture in Mulan ] [ The Legend of Hua Mulan ] [ Hua Mulan ] The Chinese legend of Hua Mulan centers on a young woman who disguises herself as a man to take the place of her elderly father in the army. The story can be traced back to The Ballad of Mulan and Disney&apos;s Mulan casts the title character in much the same way as the original legend a tomboy daughter of a respected veteran, somewhat troubled by not being the &quot; sophisticated lady &quot; her society expects her to be. In the oldest version of the story, Mulan uses her father&apos;s name Li [ March 2012 ] and she was never discovered as a girl, unlike the film. The earliest accounts of the legend state that she lived during the Northern Wei dynasty (386 –534). However another version reports that Mulan was requested as a concubine by Emperor Yang of Sui China (reigned 604 –617).

[ March 2012 ] The film correctly omits foot binding, but includes numerous other anachronism s, such as the Ming era Forbidden City in Beijing (the Sui capital was near modern Xi&apos;an ). Though Mulan is set in northern China and employs her Mandarin personal name, [ China Factbook https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html ] Disney gives her the Cantonese pronunciation (Fa) for her family name. [ Language ] When Mulan masquerades as a man, her name is a Chinese pun. She takes the name &quot; Fa Ping &quot; (花平, Huā Píng), which sounds identical to 花瓶 (huāpíng), meaning both a literal &quot; flowerpot &quot; and figurative &quot; eye candy &quot;. In Chinese versions, the joke is somewhat muted by the common practice of including subtitles to make the story easier to follow for speakers of Chinese&apos;s many dialects. The subtitles simply read 平. Chi Fu&apos;s name (欺负, qīfù) means &quot; to bully &quot;. [ Music ] [ Mulan (soundtrack) ] Mulan features a score by Jerry Goldsmith and five songs by Matthew Wilder (music) and David Zippel (lyrics), with a sixth originally planned for Mushu, but dropped following Eddie Murphy&apos;s involvement with the character. [ &quot; Songs of Mulan &quot; MulanDVD Documentary film Walt Disney Home Entertainment 2004 ] The movie&apos;s soundtrack is credited for starting the career of pop singer Christina Aguilera, whose first song to be released in the U.S. was her rendition of &quot; Reflection &quot;, the first single from the Mulan soundtrack. The song, and Aguilera&apos;s vocals, were so well received that it landed her a recording contract with RCA records. [ Smith Andy One talented teen Providence Journal 2007-05-25 ] In 1999, she would go on to release her self-titled debut album, on which Reflection was also included. As well as her own, the pop version of Reflection has 2 Spanish translations, because the movie has separate Spanish translations for Spain (performed by Malú ) and Latin America (performed by Lucero ). Other international versions include a Brazilian Portuguese version by Sandy &amp; Junior ( &quot; Imagem &quot; ), a Korean version performed by Lena Park and a Mandarin version by Coco Lee. Lea Salonga, the singing voice of Mulan in the movie, is also the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin. Salonga would also do Mulan&apos;s normal voice, but since the directors did not find her deep voice for when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, Ming-Na was brought for the role.
