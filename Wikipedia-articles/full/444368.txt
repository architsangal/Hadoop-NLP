[ March 2011 ] Goat cheese Goat cheese, or chèvre (from the French for goat), is cheese made out of the milk of goat s. [ Properties ] Although cow &apos;s milk and goat&apos;s milk have similar overall fat contents, the higher proportion of medium-chain fatty acid s such as caproic, caprylic and capric acid in goat&apos;s milk contributes to the characteristic tart flavor of goat&apos;s milk cheese. (These fatty acids take their name from the Latin for goat, capra.) { &quot; Capric acid, &quot; Chemical LAND21.com. Accessed 26 June 2008. } When chèvre is served hot, it is known as chèvre chaud. Goat milk is often consumed by young children, the elderly, those who are ill, or have a low tolerance to cow&apos;s milk. Goat milk is more similar to human milk than that of the cow, although there is large variation among breeds in both animals. Although the West has popularized the cow, goat milk and goat cheese are preferred dairy products in much of the rest of the world. Because goat cheese is often made in areas where refrigeration is limited, aged goat cheeses are often heavily treated with salt to prevent decay. As a result, salt has become associated with the flavor of goat cheese. Goat cheese has been made for thousands of years, and was probably one of the earliest made dairy products. In the most simple form, goat cheese is made by allowing raw milk to naturally curdle, and then draining and pressing the curds. Other techniques use an acid (such as vinegar or lemon juice) or rennet to coagulate the milk. Soft goat cheeses are made in kitchens all over the world, with cooks hanging bundles of cheesecloth filled with curds in the warm kitchen for several days to drain and cure. If the cheese is to be aged, it is often brined so it will form a rind, and then stored in a cool cheese cave for several months to cure. Goat cheese softens when exposed to heat, although it does not melt in the same way many cow cheeses do. Firmer goat cheeses with rinds are sometimes baked in an oven to form a gooey, warm cheese, which is ideal for spreading on bread with roasted garlic, or alone.
