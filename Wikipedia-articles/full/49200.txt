Following her retirement from cruising, she was acquired by Istithmar, the investment company of Dubai World. She was designed as a liner on the transatlantic service from her home port of Southampton, UK, to New York, USA, and was named after the earlier Cunard liner [ Queen Elizabeth ]. She served as the flagship of the line from 1969 until succeeded by [ Queen Mary 2 ] in 2004. Designed in Cunard&apos;s then headquarters and regional offices in Liverpool and Southampton respectively, and built in Clydebank, Scotland, she was considered to be the last of the great transatlantic ocean liners until the construction of the QM2 was announced. Before she was refitted with a diesel power plant in 1986/87, QE2 was also the last oil-fired passenger steamship to cross the Atlantic in scheduled liner service. During almost forty years of service, the QE2 undertook regular world cruises and latterly operated predominantly as a cruise ship, sailing out of Southampton, England. QE2 had no running mate and never ran a year-round weekly transatlantic express service to New York. QE2 did, however, continue the Cunard tradition of regular scheduled transatlantic crossings every year of her service life. QE2 retired from active Cunard service on 27 November 2008, where it was planned for her to begin conversion to a floating hotel which would have seen her eventually moored at the Palm Jumeirah, Dubai.

By the mid 1960s transatlantic travel was dominated by air travel due to its speed and low cost relative to the sea route, and expansion of air travel showed no signs of slowing down. Conversely, the [ Queen Mary 2 ] and Queen Elizabeth were becoming increasingly expensive to operate, and both internally and externally were relics of the pre-war years. Cunard did not want to give up the business of passenger service, and so gambled $80 million on a new ocean liner to replace the original ageing Queens. [ http://www.chriscunard.com/qe2_facts.php QE2 Facts 2010 Chris&apos; Cunard Page 13 May 2010 ] Realising the decline of transatlantic trade, and the rising costs of fuel and labour, Cunard decided their new ship had to be smaller and cheaper to operate than her predecessors; the design requirements of the new ship were that she was to run at the same service speed of [ 28.5 kn km/h ] as the previous Queens, use half the fuel of the older ships, operate with a reduced number of staff compared to the Elizabeth and Mary, the new vessel would also be of Panamax capacity and draw seven foot less draft to allow her to enter ports that the old Queens could not, which were two major disadvantages the old Queens had compared to the newer generation of cruise ships. Originally designated Q4 (a previous ship design Q3 had been abandoned due to falling passenger revenues on the North Atlantic), [ The QE2 Story Frame Chris Cross Rachelle 2009 The History Press UK 978-0-7524-5094-0 ] she was to be a three class liner. However, looking to the France, designs were changed to make Q4 a two class liner that could be modified into a single class cruise ship, thereby allowing the ship to ply the Atlantic during the peak summer season, as well as cruise the warmer waters during the winter.

[ February 2008 ] On board for the short journey was her Master Designate and first captain, William (Bil) Warwick. In 1971, she participated in the rescue of some 500 passengers from the burning French Line ship [ Antilles 2 ]. On 17 May 1972, while travelling from New York to Southampton, she was the subject of a bomb threat. She was searched by her crew, and the United Kingdom&apos;s Special Boat and Air Service team parachute d into the sea to conduct a search of the ship. No bomb was found, but the hoaxer was arrested by the FBI. The following year the QE2 undertook two chartered cruises through the Mediterranean to Israel in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the state&apos;s founding. One galley on the ship was koshered for Passover, and Jewish passengers were able to celebrate Passover on the ship. [ Falklands War ] In May 1982 the ship took part in the Falklands War, carrying 3,000 troops and 650 volunteer crew to the south Atlantic. She was refitted in Southampton in preparation for war service, including the installation of three helicopter pad s, the transformation of public lounges into dormitories, the installation of fuel pipes that ran through the ship down to the engine room to allow for refuelling at sea, and the covering of carpets with 2,000 sheets of hardboard. Over 650 Cunard crewmembers volunteered for the voyage to look after the 3,000 members of the Fifth Infantry Brigade, which the ship transported to South Georgia. During the voyage the ship was blacked out and the radar switched off in order to avoid detection, steaming on without modern aids.

Peter Jackson, the captain of the QE2 responded to the Queen Mother&apos;s welcome: &quot; Please convey to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, our thanks for her kind message. Cunard&apos;s Queen Elizabeth 2 is proud to have been of service to Her Majesty&apos;s Forces. &quot; The ship underwent conversion back to passenger service, with her funnel being painted in the traditional Cunard orange with black stripes which are known as &quot; Hands &quot;, at the same time the hull&apos;s exterior was repainted an unconventional light pebble grey. This colour proved unpopular with passengers, as well as difficult to maintain and so the hull reverted to traditional colours in 1983. Later that year, QE2 was fitted with a magrodome over her Quarter Deck pool. [ Diesel era ] QE2&apos;s new wider funnel QE2 once again experienced mechanical issues following her annual overhaul in November 1983. Boiler problems caused Cunard to cancel a cruise, and, in October 1984, an electrical fire caused a complete loss of power. The ship was delayed for several days before power could be restored. Instead of replacing the QE2 with a newer vessel, Cunard decided that it was more prudent to simply make improvements to her. Therefore, in 1986/87, QE2 underwent one of her most significant refurbishments when she was converted from steam power to diesel. Nine MAN B &amp; W diesel electric engines, new propellers (and new equipment to capture heat expelled by the engines) were fitted. With her new propulsion system, QE2 was expected to serve another 20 years with Cunard. The passenger accommodation was also modernised. On 7 August 1992, the hull was extensively damaged when she ran aground south of Cuttyhunk Island near Martha&apos;s Vineyard, while returning from a five day cruise to Halifax, Nova Scotia along the east coast of the United States and Canada. A combination of her speed, an uncharted shoal and underestimating the increase in the ship&apos;s draft due to the effect of squat led to the ship&apos;s hull scraping rocks on the ocean floor. The accident resulted in the passengers disembarking earlier than scheduled at nearby Newport, Rhode Island and the ship being taken out of service while temporary repairs were made in drydock at Boston. Several days later, divers found red paint on previously uncharted rocks in the vicinity of where the ship was said to have hit bottom.

QE2 emerged from the refit having every major public room refurbished. She also appeared for the first time with a Royal Blue hull. It was during this refit that the Heritage Trail was added to QE2.

[ Design ] QE2 in Southampton, 1976, with her original white funnel QE2&apos;s long bow was typical of ocean liners { River Clyde for her 40th birthday } [ Exterior ] Like both the [ Normandie 2 ] and [ France 1961 2 ], the QE2 has a flared stem and clean forecastle. What was controversial at the time was that Cunard decided not to paint the funnel with the line&apos;s distinctive colour and pattern, something that had been done on all merchant vessels since the first Cunard ship, the [ Britannia ], sailed in 1840. Instead the funnel was painted white and black, with the Cunard orange-red appearing only on the inside of the wind scoop. This practice ended in 1983 when the QE2 returned from service in the Falklands War, and the funnel has been painted in Cunard traditional colours (orange and black), with black horizontal bands (known as &quot; hands &quot; ) ever since. The original pencil-like funnel was replaced in 1986 with a more robust one, when the ship was converted from steam to diesel power. Large quantities of aluminium were used in the framing and cladding of the QE2 s superstructure. This decision was designed to save weight, reducing the draft of the ship and lowering the fuel consumption, but it also posed the possibility of corrosion problems that can occur with joining the dissimilar metals together, so a jointing compound was coated between the steel and aluminium surfaces to prevent this happening. The low melting point of aluminium caused concern when the QE2 was serving as a troop ship during the Falklands War : some feared that if the ship were struck by a missile, as was [ Sheffield D80 6 ], her upper decks would collapse quickly due to fire, thereby causing greater casualties. In 1972, the first penthouse suites were added in an aluminium structure on Signal Deck and Sports Deck (now &quot; Sun Deck &quot; ), behind the ship&apos;s bridge, and in 1977 this structure was expanded to include more suites with balconies, making the QE2 one of the first ships to offer private terraces to passengers since the Normandie in the 1930s. QE2 s balcony accommodation was expanded for the final time during QE2 s 1986/87 refurbishment in Bremerhaven. During this refit the ship was given a new wider funnel built using panels from the original. It retained the traditional Cunard colours. QE2&apos;s final structural changes included the reworking of the aft decks during the 1994 refit (following the removal of the Magrodome and the addition of an undercover area on Sun Deck during her 2005 refit creating a space known as Funnel Bar. [ Interiors ] The Queen Elizabeth 2 s interior configuration was laid out in a horizontal fashion, similar to the SS France, where the spaces dedicated to the two classes were spread horizontally on specific decks, in contrast to the vertical class divisions of older liners. Where the QE2 differed from the France was that the first class deck (Quarter Deck) was below the deck dedicated to tourist class (Upper Deck). Originally there were to be main lounges serving three classes, layered one atop the other, but when Cunard decided to make the ship a two class vessel, only two main lounges were needed. Instead of completely reconfiguring the Boat Deck, the ship&apos;s architects simply opened a well in the deck between what were to have been the second and third class lounges, creating a double height space known as the Double Room (now the Grand Lounge). This too was unconventional in that it designated a grander two storey space for tourist class passengers, while first class passengers gathered in the standard height Queen&apos;s Room. However, the configuration for segregated Atlantic crossings gave first class passengers the theatre balcony on Boat Deck, while tourist class used the orchestra level on Upper Deck. Over the span of her thirty nine year sea going career, the QE2 has had a number of interior refits and alterations. The year she came into service, 1969, was also the year of the Apollo 11 mission, when the Concorde &apos;s prototype was unveiled, and the previous year Stanley Kubrick &apos;s film 2001: A Space Odyssey premiered. In keeping with those times, originally Cunard broke from the traditional interiors of their previous liners for the QE2, especially the Art Deco style of the previous Queens. Instead modern materials like plastic laminates, aluminium, and Plexiglas were used. Furniture was modular and abstract art was used throughout public rooms and cabins. The Midships Lobby on Two Deck, where first class passengers boarded for transatlantic journeys and all passengers boarded for cruises, was a circular room with a sunken seating area in the centre with green leather clad banquettes, and surrounded by a chrome railing. As a kingpin to this was a flared, white, trumpet shaped, up lit column. Another room where the QE2 s advanced interior design was demonstrated was the first class lounge, the Queen&apos;s Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a recessed, slotted ceiling, and indirect lighting. As well, the columns were flared in the same fashion as the one in the Midships Lobby, with recessed up lighting, and also reflecting the shape of the bases of the tables and leather shell chairs. The Theatre Bar on Upper Deck featured red chairs, red drapes, a red egg crate fibreglass screen, and even a red baby grand piano. Some more traditional materials like wood veneer were used as highlights throughout the ship, especially in passenger corridors and staterooms. There was also an Observation Bar on Quarter Deck, a successor to its namesake, located in a similar location, on both previous Queens, which offered views through large windows over the ship&apos;s bow. This room was lost in the QE2 s 1972 refit, becoming galley space with the forward-facing windows plated over. In the 1994 refit almost all of the remaining original decor was replaced, with Cunard opting to reverse the original design direction of the QE2 s designers and use the line&apos;s traditional ocean liners as inspiration. The green velvet and leather Midships Bar became the Art Deco inspired Chart Room, receiving an original, custom designed piano from the Queen Mary. The (by now) blue dominated Theatre Bar was transformed into the Golden Lion Pub, which mimics a traditional Edwardian pub. Some original elements were retained including the flared columns in the Queens Room and Mid-Ships Lobby which were incorporated into the reworked designs. By the time of her retirement, the Synagogue was the only room that had remained unaltered since 1969. [ http://members.tripod.com/~Tziper/today.htm Queen Elizabeth 2: Today Members.tripod.com 14 July 2010 ] However it was reported that during QE2 s 22 October five night voyage, the Synagogue was carefully dismantled before being removed from the ship prior to her final sailing to Dubai.

In the Mauretania Restaurant sits Althea Wynne&apos;s sculpture of the White Horses of the Atlantic Ocean. There are bronze busts of both Sir Samuel Cunard (outside the Yacht Club) and Queen Elizabeth II (in the Queen&apos;s Room). The Princess Grill holds four life-size statues of human forms representing the four elements, done by sculptor Janine Janet in marine materials like shell and coral. The Chart Room&apos;s frieze was designed by Brody Nevenshwander, and depicts the words of T. S. Eliot, Sir Francis Drake, and John Masefield. The Midships Lobby holds a solid silver model of the Queen Elizabeth 2 made by Asprey of Bond Street in 1975, that was lost until a photograph was found in 1997 that led to the discovery of the model itself, and its placement on the QE2 in 1999. In &quot; E &quot; stairway hangs three custom designed tapestries, commissioned from Helena Barynina Hernmarck for the ship&apos;s launch, that depict the Queen as well as the launch of the ship. These tapestries, which were originally hung in &quot; D &quot; Stairway, Quarter Deck, outside the Columbia Restaurant, were damaged in 2005, as mentioned in the Service history (above). They were originally made with golden threads; however much of this was lost when they were cleaned incorrectly as part of the 1987 refit. There are numerous photographs, oils and pastels of members of the Royal Family throughout the vessel, and silver plaques commemorating the visits of every member of the Royal Family, as well as other dignitaries like South African president Nelson Mandela. Amongst the artefacts on board is a set of antique Japanese armour presented to the QE2 by the Governor of Kagoshima, Japan, during her 1979 world cruise, and a Wedgwood vase presented to the ship by Lord Wedgwood. Items from previous Cunard ships include a brass relief plaque with a fish motif from the first [ Mauretania 1906 ], and an Art Deco bas-relief titled Winged Horse and Clouds, by Norman Foster from RMS Queen Elizabeth. There is also a vast array of Cunard postcards, porcelain, flatware, boxes, linen, and Lines Bros Tri-ang Minic model ships. One of her key pieces is a replica of the figurehead from Cunard&apos;s first ship, RMS Britannia, carved from Quebec yellow pine by Cornish sculptor Charles Moore, and presented to the ship by Lloyd&apos;s of London. On the Upper Deck sits the silver Boston Commemorative Cup, presented to Britannia by the City of Boston in 1840. This cup was lost for decades until being found in a pawn shop in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On &quot; 2 &quot; Deck is a bronze entitled Spirit of the Atlantic which was designed by Barney Seale for the second [ Mauretania 1938 ]. A large wooden plaque was presented to the QE2 by First Sea Lord Sir John Fieldhouse to commemorate the ship&apos;s service as a Hired Military Transport (HMT) in the Falklands War. There is also an extensive collection of large scale models of Cunard ships throughout the QE2. [ http://www.magwa.co.uk/qe2/qe2prt01.htm Interiors of QE2 following The Cunard Heritage Trail in part Magwa.co.uk 10 May 2012 ] Most of these items were sold by Cunard to Istithmar when they purchased QE2.

These are located forward and aft on decks three through six. At the time she entered service, the crew areas were a significant improvement over those aboard [ Queen Mary ] and RMS Queen Elizabeth, however the ship&apos;s age and the lack of renovation of the crew area during her 40 years of service, in contrast to passenger areas which were updated periodically, meant that this accommodation was considered basic by the end of her career. Officers were accommodated in single cabins with private en-suite bathrooms located on Sun Deck. There were three crew bars, one named The Pig &amp; Whistle. ( &quot; The Pig &quot; for short and a tradition aboard Cunard ships), Castaways and the Fo&apos;c&apos;s&apos;le Club. A fourth bar, dedicated for the officers is located at the forward end of Boat Deck. Named The Officers Wardroom this area enjoys forward facing views and was often opened to passengers for cocktail parties hosted by the senior officers. The crew mess is situated at the forward end of One Deck which is adjacent to the crew services office. [ Technical ] { Bremerhaven } &apos;&apos;QE2&apos;&apos; &apos; s original funnel, removed while being re-engined, her old fixed pitch propellers are lying to the bottom left hand side on the photo. After the ship was launched, the QE2 was fitted out with a steam turbine propulsion system utilising three Foster Wheeler E.S.D II boilers, which provided steam for the two Brown-Pametrada turbines. The turbines were rated with a maximum power output figure of 110,000 shaft horsepower (normally operating at 94,000  hp) and were coupled to two six-bladed fixed-pitch propeller s. The steam turbines were plagued with problems from the time the ship first entered service and, despite being technically advanced and fuel-efficient in 1968, her consumption of 600 tons of fuel oil every twenty four hours was more than expected for such a ship by the 1980s. After seventeen years of service the availability of spare parts was becoming difficult due to the outdated design of the boilers and turbines, and Cunard decided that the options were to either do nothing for the remainder of the ship&apos;s life, re-configure the existing engines, or re-engine the vessel with a more efficient diesel-electric powerplant. Ultimately it was decided to replace the engines, as it was calculated that the savings in fuel costs and maintenance would pay for themselves over four years, and give the vessel a minimum of another twenty years of service, whereas the other options would only provide short-term relief. [ http://www.roblightbody.com/liners/qe-2/1987_Refit/ Rob Lightbody QE2&apos;s Major 1986 – 1987 re-engining refit 8 February 2011 ] Her steam turbines had taken her to a record breaking total of 2,622,858 miles in 18 years. [ http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20History.html The Cunarders The Cunarders QE2 History 23 March 2011 ] During the ship&apos;s 1986 to 1987 refit, the steam turbines were removed and scrapped. The engine rooms were then fitted with nine German MAN L58/64 nine-cylinder, medium-speed diesel engines, each weighing approximately 120 tons. Using a diesel-electric configuration, each engine drives a generator, each developing 10.5 MW of electrical power at 10,000 volts. This electrical plant, in addition to powering the ship&apos;s auxiliary and hotel services through transformers, drives the two main propulsion motors, one on each propeller shaft. These motors produce 44 MW each and are of synchronised salient-pole construction, nine metres in diameter and weighing more than 400 tons each. The ship&apos;s service speed of [ 28.5 kn km/h ] can be maintained using only seven of the diesel-electric sets. Her maximum power output with the new engine configuration running was now 130,000  hp, which is greater than the previous system&apos;s 110,000  hp. Using the same IBF-380 ( Bunker C ) fuel, the new configuration yielded a 35% fuel saving over the previous system. During the re-engining process, her funnel was replaced by a wider one in order to accommodate the exhaust pipes for the nine B &amp; W diesel engines. Also during refit, the fixed pitch propellers were replaced with variable-pitch propellers. The old steam engines required astern turbines to move the ship backwards or stop her moving forward. The pitch of the new variable pitch blades, however, could simply be reversed, causing a reversal of propeller thrust while maintaining the same direction of propeller rotation, allowing the ship shorter stopping times and improved handling characteristics. The new propellers were originally fitted with &quot; Grim Wheels &quot;, named after their inventor, Dr.-Ing. Otto Grim. These were free-spinning propeller blades fitted behind the main propellers, with long vanes protruding from the centre hub. These were designed to recover lost propeller thrust and reduce fuel consumption by 2.5 to 3%. However, after the trial of these wheels, when the ship was drydocked, the majority of the vanes on each wheel were discovered to have broken off, and so the wheels were removed and the project abandoned. Other machinery includes nine heat recovery boilers, coupled with two oil-fired boilers to produce steam for heating fuel, domestic water, swimming pools, laundry equipment, and galleys. Four flash evaporators and a reverse-osmosis unit desalinate sea water to produce 1000 tons of fresh water daily. There is also a sanitation system and sewage disposal plant, air conditioning plant, and an electro-hydraulic steering system.

Due to various historical precedents of Cunard and other ship naming practices, and other occurrences surrounding the launch ceremony and form of the name of the QE2, it is uncertain whether the liner is named as the second liner named Queen Elizabeth, or after the reigning monarch who named the ship, Queen Elizabeth II. [ January 2012 ] [ Background ] In 1934 the Queen Mary was named by and after Queen Mary (Mary of Teck) and in 1938 the Queen Elizabeth was named by and after Queen Elizabeth (Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the future Queen Mother), who were both at the time of the naming serving Queen consort s to a reigning King. These two previous Cunarders both had capitalised bow names, as QUEEN ELIZABETH and QUEEN MARY. Cunard practice at the time of naming the QE2 was to re use the existing name of its former ships, for example, launching the [ Mauretania 1938 2 ] in 1938 after the previous [ Mauretania 1906 2 ] was scrapped in 1935. The original Queen Elizabeth was still in service with Cunard when the QE2 was launched in 1967, although she was retired and sold before the QE2 entered revenue service with Cunard in 1969. The addition of a 2 in this manner was unknown at the time, but it was not unknown for Roman numerals to denote ships in service with the same name. Two non Cunard ships were named Queen Mary II, a Clyde steamer, and Mauretania II, a Southampton steamer of Red Funnel, since the Cunard ships already had the names without Roman numerals. [ Launch ] As was Cunard practice at the time, the name of the liner was not to be publicly revealed until the launch.

These state that, as at the launch ceremony, an envelope and card were also held in New York in case of transmission failure, and when opened the card was found to read the name Queen Elizabeth, and that the decision to add &quot; The Second &quot; to the name was an alteration by the Queen. The book quotes the Cunard chairman Sir Basil [ y Smallpeice ] as saying &quot; The Queen Mary [named] after her Grandmother, the Queen Elizabeth after her mother, and now this magnificent ship after herself. &quot; Following the unexpected addition of the Second by the Queen, the book attributes the use of lower case lettering and a numeric 2 – rather than a Roman II – to the decision by Cunard to use a more modern typeface to suit the style of the 1960s. The book also surmises that the naming of the liner after the reigning monarch, in the form Queen Elizabeth II, was potentially offensive to some Scots, as the title of Queen Elizabeth II (of the United Kingdom) relates to the lineage of the throne of England (the Tudor monarch Elizabeth I having reigned only in England).

The name was discussed with Lord Adeane, the queen&apos;s private secretary, and it was decided simply to ask that the new ship be named Queen Elizabeth, because by the time of her commissioning, both of the earlier Queens would be withdrawn from service and she could assume the name vacated by one of her predecessors... Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II moved to the front of the launching platform and was handed an envelope by John Rannie with the name of the ship inside. This was a tradition because many years before someone purportedly had forgotten the name of a ship about to be launched. The envelope remained unopened as the queen stepped forward and uttered the words, &quot; I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth the Second. May God Bless her and all who sail in her &quot;...

(paragraph reference his autobiography ISBN 0-906393-10-8) He could not have been more delighted with having the third of the great royal Cunarders named in this manner. The decision promptly was made to style the giant liner Queen Elizabeth 2 using the numeral two to differentiate the ship from the sovereign. } also states that the Queen initiated the surprise move of naming the liner after herself rather than simply Queen Elizabeth as originally planned (the name being made vacant by the retirement of the current liner before the new one was commissioned). This name had been given to the Queen in a sealed envelope which she didn&apos;t open. The book, referencing his autobiography, states that the Cunard chairman Sir Basil [ y Smallpeice ] was delighted with this development, it being in keeping with the previous Queen liners, and the 2 was added by Cunard for differentiation of the ship while still denoting it was named after the Queen.
