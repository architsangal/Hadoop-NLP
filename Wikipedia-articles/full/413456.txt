[ the character created by Roald Dahl known as the Big Friendly Giant The BFG ] [ The Friendly Giant children&apos;s show 15 minutes Bob Homme Bob Homme Rod Coneybeare (puppeteer) United States (1953-1958) Canada (1958-1985) WHA-TV (1953-1958) CBC Television (1958-1985) September 1958 March 1985 (Canada) 3,000+ ] The Friendly Giant was a popular Canadian children&apos;s television program that aired on CBC Television from September 1958 through to March 1985. It featured three main characters: a giant named Friendly (played by Bob Homme ), who lived in a huge castle, along with his puppet animal friends Rusty (a rooster who played a harp and lived in a book bag hung by the castle window) and Jerome (a giraffe). The two principal puppets were manipulated and voiced by Rod Coneybeare. [ Beginnings ] The program started in 1953 on Madison, Wisconsin radio station WHA-AM. Shortly thereafter, the show was moved to the UW-Madison &apos;s WHA-TV. Kinescopes of these shows were distributed to a few other non-commercial stations, and some of them made it to the CBC headquarters in Toronto. At the invitation of Fred Rainsberry, the head of Children&apos;s Television at the CBC, in 1958 Bob Homme moved the show to Canada, where it became a staple show for several generations of young viewers. In the United States, National Educational Television carried both WHA and CBC versions from 1953 until 1970, when NET ceded the network to the Public Broadcasting Service. [ Format ] The short, 15-minute show was perhaps most famous for its opening sequence. Each episode would begin with the camera panning over a detailed model of part of a village as Friendly could be heard observing the goings on in the town below. Suddenly, his giant boot would come into view and Friendly would ask the viewers to &quot; Look up, look waaaaay up! &quot; and the Giant would invite everyone to come visit his castle. The traditional tune Early One Morning would then be heard being played on harp and recorder, while the camera slowly zoomed into the Giant&apos;s castle, whose drawbridge and doors opened wide in welcome. Once inside, The Friendly Giant would put out miniature furniture for his viewers beside his feet (with only his feet and hands visible), saying, &quot; One little chair for one of you, and a bigger chair for two more to curl up in, and for someone who likes to rock, a rocking chair in the middle. &quot; Typically, Jerome the Giraffe would visit, poking his head in through a high window. Rusty the Rooster, who lived in a book bag hanging on the wall by the window, would emerge and produce from the bag books to be read and other props, some seemingly larger than could fit in the bag. The rest of the show focused on gentle, humorous chat between Friendly, Rusty and Jerome, followed by a story or a musical performance. When extra instrumentation was needed, a pair of otherwise silent puppet cats  — Angie and Fiddle, the Jazz Cats  — joined in. Music for the show was composed by the show&apos;s harpist, John Duncan. [ Desjardins Carolyn Whitley Duncan, John http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm%3DTCE%26amp%3BParams%3DU1ARTU0001058 Encyclopedia of Music in Canada 24 February 2011 ] At the show&apos;s conclusion, Friendly would put his miniature furniture away and his large, kindly hand would wave goodbye as the camera would zoom out and the castle&apos;s drawbridge would be raised; as a silvery moon rose into the sky a cow would jump over it. Once, when the cow failed to make an appearance, the CBC was inundated with phone calls from disappointed viewers. [ November 2007 ] (On occasion, often for episodes devoted to musical performances, episodes would take place completely at night.) The shows were largely ad lib bed, typically based around a one-page plot summary for each episode. This gave the show an added spontaneity uncommon to most children&apos;s shows, though the series was marked by a go-slow, gentle nature. The simple repetition of its main elements from show to show put it fundamentally at odds with the bolder, ever-changing nature of such shows as Sesame Street. Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, The Friendly Giant launched a block of children&apos;s programming aired by the CBC each weekday morning; it was followed in the block by Mr. Dressup and the Canadian version of Sesame Street. &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;The Friendly Giant&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;s model castle, used during the opening sequence [ Cancellation ] In 1984, the Canadian federal government made deep cuts into the CBC budget, and The Friendly Giant was cancelled soon afterwards, though CBC executives insisted that the show&apos;s passing was unrelated to the cuts. [ January 2009 ] It was commonly thought at the time that the move was intended to create enough public outrage that the government funding cuts to the CBC would be reversed. [ January 2009 ] While there was strong public sentiment to keep the show on the air, the funding cuts were not reversed, and no new shows were made. It aired regularly for years afterwards as repeats. [ September 2010 ] The show&apos;s replacement, Fred Penner&apos;s Place, has been referred to by some people as &quot; the Giant Killer &quot;. [ Life &amp; Times: Growing Up Canadian CBC ] By the time &apos;The Friendly Giant&apos; ended, more than 3,000 episodes of the show had been produced. [ Post-cancellation ] The star of the show, Robert Homme, was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1998. He died on May 2, 2000, at the age of 81 of prostate cancer. Approximately 850 episodes of the show are currently held in the CBC&apos;s archive, including kinescope s of the earliest episodes. The Friendly Giant was honoured as a Masterwork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada in 2005. The authorized biography of Robert Homme called Look Up  — Way Up is based on interviews conducted with Bob after he retired. Links to memorable audio clips are included. [ Props controversy ] Props, costumes and puppets from the show were on display at the CBC Museum in Toronto as part of an exhibit called Growing Up with CBC in Toronto. However, Friendly Giant paraphernalia was removed from the CBC Museum, after the puppets Rusty and Jerome appeared in a sketch during the 2007 Gemini Awards without permission from the Homme family. Homme&apos;s daughter said that the clip was in poor taste and disrespected the memory of her father.
