It is home to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, the largest container shipping facility in Port of New York and New Jersey, 3rd largest and one of busiest in the United States. An estuary, it is periodically dredged to accommodate ocean-going container ship s. [ Geography ] Newark Bay is rectangular, approximately 5.5 miles (8.9  km) long, varying in width from 0.6 to1.2 miles. { US Army Corps of Engineers: Newark Bay } It is enclosed on the west by the cities of Newark and Elizabeth, and on the east by Jersey City and Bayonne. At the south is Staten Island, New York and at the north Kearny Point and Droyer&apos;s Point mark the mouth of the Hackensack. Shooters Island is a bird sanctuary where the borders of Staten Island, Bayonne and Elizabeth meet at one point. [ Hagstrom Map Company, Inc 0-88097-763-9 Hudson County New Jersey Street Map 2008 ] The southern tip of Bergen Neck, known as Bergen Point, juts into the bay and lent its name to the former Bergen Point Lighthouse. Built offshore in 1849 it was demolished and replaced with a skeletal tower in the mid 20th century. { Bergen Point Lighthouse, 1849-1949, New Jersey Lighthouse Society. } The Atlantic Ocean at Sandy Hook and Rockaway Point is approximately 11 miles away and reached by tidal strait s dredged to maintain shipping lanes. Newark Bay is connected to Upper New York Bay by the Kill Van Kull and to Raritan Bay by the Arthur Kill. The names of the channels reflect the period of Dutch colonialization. The area around the bay was called Achter Kol, which translates as behind or beyond the ridge and refers to Bergen Hill. The emergence of the Hudson Palisades begins on Bergen Neck, the peninsula between the bay and the Hudson River. Kill in Dutch means stream or channel. During the British colonial era the bay was known as Cull bay. [ Grabas Joseph A. Land Speculation and Proprietary Beginnings of New Jersey The Advocate XVI 4 3, 20, 14 New Jersey Land Title Association http://www.njlta.org/Dec2004.pdf April 15, 2010 ] Kill van Kull literally translates as channel from the ridge. Arthur Kill is an anglicisation of achter kill meaning back channel, which would speak to its location behind Staten Island. Many of the maritime and distribution facilities along the bay are part of Foreign Trade Zone 49 { PANYNJ FTZ 49 } [ Bridges ] The bay is spanned by the Vincent R. Casciano Memorial Bridge which carries the Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike. The Lehigh Valley Railroad Bridge is a vertical lift bridge north of the Casciano is now used by CSX Transportation for freight shipment, including the notable Juice Train. Central Railroad of New Jersey &apos;s Newark Bay Bridge crossed the bay from 1864 to connect its Communipaw Terminal. Last used in 1978, it was determined to be a hazard to maritime navigation and demolished in the 1980s. [ Shoreline ] [ Shooters Island ] [ Elizabethport to the Ironbound ] Elizabeth is the site of the first English speaking European settlement (1675) in New Jersey, its port at the southern end of the bay a major maritme hub during the colonial era. Jersey Gardens, an outlet mall, has been located north of Elizabethport since 1999. There are plans to construct a mixed used community adjacent to it along the bay. { $2B MXD Planned for Elizabeth Waterfront } The western edge of Newark Bay was originally shallow tidal wetlands covering approximately [ 12 sqmi km2 ]. In 1910s the City of Newark began excavating an angled shipping channel in the northeastern quadrant of the wetland which formed the basis of Port Newark.

Shipping operations languished after the war, and in 1927, the City of Newark started construction of Newark Liberty International Airport on the northwest quadrant of the wetlands which lay between Port Newark and the edge of the developed city. Port Authority took over the operations of Port Newark and the Newark Airport in 1948 and began modernizing and expanding both facilities southward. In 1958, the Port Authority dredged another shipping channel which straightened the course of Bound Brook, the tidal inlet forming the boundary between Newark and Elizabeth. Dredged materials was used to create new upland south of the new Elizabeth Channel, where the Port Authority constructed the Elizabeth Marine Terminal. The first shipping facility to open upon the Elizabeth Channel was the new [ 90 acre ha on ] Sea-Land Container Terminal, which was the prototype for virtually every other container terminal constructed thereafter. The Ironbound is an industrial area along the bay which becomes residential farther inland near Downtown Newark. [ Kearny Point ] The Kearny Point peninsula is site of the River Terminal, a massive distribution facility. { River Terminal } It comprises the former Western Electric Kearny Works and Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, the shipyards of which operated from 1917 to 1949 and played a prominent role in both World War I and World War II. { Kearny Yard } [ Bergen Point to Droyer&apos;s Point ] { Bayonne } While there was some martime development on the eastern banks of the bay closer Bergen Point most of the eastern shore abuts residential and recreational areas. The Hackensack RiverWalk is a partially completed linear park greenway intended to link the string of parks along its banks and that of the Hackensack River from the Bayonne Bridge to the Hackensack Meadowlands in Secaucus and North Bergen. In Bayonne much of the bay has not seen bulkhead development, and hence has a natural shore line. The city&apos;s largest parks are its shores. { Hackenack Riverwalk Plan proposal 2003 } { Hudson County Master Plan } At Droyer&apos;s Point recreational and residential development have included a promenade. [ Howland Hook ] The Howland Hook Marine Terminal is a container port facility located at the northwestern corner of Staten Island at the entrance to the Arthur Kill.
