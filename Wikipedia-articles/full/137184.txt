[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1450387 } [ 3 ] Hildale is a city in Washington County, Utah, United States. The population was 2,726 at the 2010 census. Hildale is a twin city to the more well-known Colorado City, Arizona, both of which straddle the border between Utah and Arizona. Hildale is the headquarters of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Many adults in the community practice plural marriage. Since most government officials — including the police force — are FLDS members, some critics have likened the community&apos;s atmosphere to that of a prison, which is the result of attempts to discourage any of the town&apos;s women from attempting to leave the polygamous lifestyle. { theHOPEorg.org } In January 2004, FLDS leader and prophet, Warren Jeffs, expelled a group of twenty men, including the mayor, and &quot; gave &quot; their wives and children to other men. Jeffs said he was acting on the orders of God, but the men he expelled claimed they were penalized for disagreeing with Jeffs. Observers say this is the most severe split to date within the community. Jeffs was placed on the FBI&apos;s Ten Most Wanted list and was eventually apprehended on August 28, 2006 in Las Vegas. On September 25, 2007, Jeffs was convicted of being an accomplice to rape for performing marriage between a 14-year-old girl and her 19-year-old cousin. The United Effort Plan, the financial arm of the FLDS owns most of the property in the town. The Colorado City/Hildale area has the world&apos;s highest incidence of fumarase deficiency, an extremely rare genetic condition which causes severe mental retardation. Geneticists attribute this to the prevalence of cousin marriage between descendants of two of the town&apos;s founders, Joseph Smith Jessop and John Yates Barlow. At least half of the double community&apos;s inhabitants are descended from one or both men. { &quot; Forbidden Fruit &quot; by John Dougherty, Phoenix New Times, December 29, 2005. } [ April 2010 raid ] On April 6, 2010, law enforcement officials in Mohave County, Arizona and Washington County, Utah served five search warrants seeking records from town officers.

[ History ] [ May 2010 ] Hildale has a history of polygamy. LDS Church leaders reportedly sent John D. Lee to the area in 1871 to hide him from federal authorities. The FBI raided Colorado City in 1944 to break up a local polygamy ring, arresting fifteen men. In 1953, law enforcement officials again raided Colorado City, arresting twenty-three men. Hildale resident Warren Jeffs was charged by the FBI with arranging marriages of underage girls and was captured in August 2006. On September 25, 2007, Jeffs was found guilty of two counts of being an accomplice to rape. According to the Associated Press, Jeffs is rumored to have children from numerous wives. In 2001, the Los Angeles Times reported that welfare fraud is widespread in both Hildale and Colorado City. As many as half of plural wives are on government assistance. The fraud arises from the women&apos;s claims that they do not know the whereabouts of the children&apos;s fathers. Former State Senator Ron Allen remarked &quot; The social costs of polygamy are quite high. The things I&apos;m most worried about in polygamy are physical and sexual abuse of children, forced marriages among minors, welfare and tax fraud, and the diminished educational opportunities, especially among girls. None of this is acceptable. &quot; [ Government and infrastructure ] Colorado City, AZ/Hildale, UT Post Office The United States Postal Service operates the Colorado City, AZ/Hildale, UT Post Office in Colorado City, Arizona. { &quot; Post Office™ Location - COLORADO CITY. &quot; } { United States Post Office.
