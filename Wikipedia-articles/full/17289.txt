He served as Defense Minister and Marshal of the Soviet Union from 1935 and 1936, respectively, until his death in 1969. [ Early life and Russian Revolution ] Voroshilov was born in the settlement Verkhnye, Bakhmut county (uyezd), Yekaterinoslav Governorate (now part of Lysychansk city in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine), in the Russian Empire, into a railway worker&apos;s family of Russian ethnicity. { http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1089 } However, according to the Soviet Major General Pyotr Grigorenko Voroshilov himself was pointing out to his Ukrainian heritage and previous family name of Voroshilo. { Pyotr Grigorenko. &quot; В ПОДПОЛЬЕ МОЖНО ВСТРЕТИТЬ ТОЛЬКО КРЫС... &quot; (In the underground one may find only rats...). Institute &quot; Open society &quot; - Cooperation and Association Fund &quot; Liberty Road &quot;. 1981 ( Cover of the book ) } Voroshilov joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1905. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Voroshilov became a member of the Ukrainian Council of People&apos;s Commissars and Commissar for Internal Affairs along with Vasili Averin. He was well known for aiding Joseph Stalin in the Military Council (led by Leon Trotsky ), having become closely associated with Stalin during the Red Army &apos;s 1918 defense of Tsaritsyn. Voroshilov was instrumental as a commander of the Southern Front during the Russian Civil War and the Polish-Soviet War while with the 1st Cavalry Army. As Political Commissar serving co-equally with Stalin, Voroshilov was responsible for the morale of the 1st Cavalry Army, whose men were composed chiefly of peasants from southern Russia. { Brown, Stephen. &quot; Communists and the Red Cavalry: The Political Education of the Konarmiia in the Russian Civil War, 1918–20 &quot; The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 73, No. 1 (Jan. 1995), p. 88 } Voroshilov&apos;s efforts as Commissar did not prevent a resounding defeat at the Battle of Komarów or regular outbreaks of murderous anti-Semitic violence within the Cavalry army&apos;s ranks. { Barmine, Alexander, One Who Survived, New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), footnote, p. 21 } He was the Head of Leningrad Police between 1917 and 1918. [ Political career ] { Turkish leader } { Mustafa Kemal Atatürk at the celebration ceremony for the tenth anniversary of the Turkish Republic. } Voroshilov was elected to the Central Committee in 1921 and remained a member until 1961. In 1925, after the death of Mikhail Frunze, Voroshilov was appointed People&apos;s Commissar for Military and Navy Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR, a post he held until 1934. Frunze&apos;s position was compatible with [ August 2010 ] the Troika ( Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Stalin), but Stalin preferred to have a close ally in charge (as opposed to Frunze, a &quot; Zinovievite &quot; ). Frunze was urged to have surgery to treat an old stomach ulcer. He died on the operating table of an overdose of chloroform, an anesthetic. Stalin&apos;s critics [ August 2010 ] charge that the surgery was used to disguise the assassination of Frunze [ August 2010 ]. Voroshilov was made a full member of the newly formed Politburo in 1926, remaining a member until 1960. A postage stamp featuring Voroshilov from 1976 Voroshilov was appointed People&apos;s Commissar for Defence in 1934 and a Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1935. Voroshilov played a central role in Stalin&apos;s Great Purge of the 1930s, denouncing many of his own military colleagues and subordinates when asked to do so by Stalin. He went so far as to write personal letters to exiled former Soviet officers and diplomats such as Mikhail Ostrovsky to return voluntarily to the Soviet Union, reassuring them that they would not face retribution from authorities (they did). Voroshilov personally signed 185 documented execution lists, fourth among the Soviet leadership after Molotov, Stalin and Kaganovich. { http://stalin.memo.ru/images/intro1.htm } During World War II, Voroshilov was a member of the State Defense Committee. Voroshilov commanded Soviet troops during the Winter War from November 1939 to January 1940, but, due to his poor planning and overall incompetence, the Red Army suffered about 185,000 casualties. When the leadership gathered at Stalin&apos;s dacha at Kuntsevo Stalin shouted at Voroshilov who replied in kind, blaming the failure on Stalin for killing the Red Army&apos;s best generals in his purges. Voroshilov followed this by smashing a platter of roast suckling pig on the table. Nikita Khrushchev said it was the only time he ever witnessed such an outburst [ August 2010 ]. Voroshilov still became the scapegoat for the initial failures in Finland. He was later replaced as Defence Commissar by Semyon Timoshenko. Voroshilov was then made Deputy Premier responsible for cultural matters. { Sebag Montefiore, Simon 2004 Stalin The Court of the Red Tsar, Phoenix London ISBN 0-7538-1766-7 pp340-1 } Voroshilov initially argued that thousands of Polish army officers captured in September 1939 should be released but later signed the order for their execution. Vasili Blokhin of the NKVD personally shot 7000 of them in 28 nights using German Walther pistols. { Sebag Montefiore, Simon 2004 Stalin The Court of the Red Tsar, Phoenix London ISBN 0-7538-1766-7 pp337-9 } { Maxim Gorky, } { Joseph Stalin (left to right) 1931 photo } After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Voroshilov was made commander of the short-lived Northwestern Direction, controlling several fronts. In September 1941 he commanded Leningrad Front. Working alongside military commander Andrei Zhdanov as German advances threatened to cut off Leningrad he displayed considerable personal bravery, prancing around in defiance of heavy shelling at Ivanovskoye; at one point he rallied retreating troops and personally led a counter-attack against German tanks armed only with a pistol. { Stalin&apos;s folly: The Tragic First Ten Days of WWII on the Eastern Front, Constantine Pleshakov, 2006, p.268 } Failing to prevent the Germans from surrounding Leningrad however, he was dismissed from that post and replaced by the far abler Georgy Zhukov on 8 September 1941. { Sebag Montefiore, Simon 2004 Stalin The Court of the Red Tsar, Phoenix London ISBN 0-7538-1766-7 pp391-95 } In an embarrassing incident at the 1943 Tehran Conference, during a ceremony to receive the &quot; Sword of Stalingrad &quot; from Winston Churchill, he took the sword from Stalin but then allowed the sword to fall from its scabbard onto his toes in the presence of the Big Three wartime leaders. { Winston Churchill, } { Closing the Ring, Vol. 5, p. 321. } In 1945–1947, he supervised the establishment of the communist regime in Hungary. [ August 2010 ] { Nikita Khrushchev and Finnish president } { Urho Kekkonen in 1960 } In 1952, Voroshilov was appointed a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee. Stalin&apos;s death on 5 March 1953 prompted major changes in the Soviet leadership and in [ August 2010 ] March 1953, Voroshilov was approved as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (i.e., the head of state) with Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Communist Party and Georgy Malenkov as Premier of the Soviet Union. Voroshilov, Malenkov, and Khrushchev brought about 26 June 1953 arrest of Lavrenty Beria after Stalin&apos;s death. [ Retirement ] After Khruschev removed most of the old Stalinists, like Molotov and Malenkov from the party, Voroshilov&apos;s career began to fade. On 7 May 1960, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union granted Voroshilov&apos;s request for retirement and elected Leonid Brezhnev chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council (the head of state). The Central Committee also relieved him of duties as a member of the Party Presidium (as the Politburo had been called since 1952) on 16 July 1960. In October 1961, his political defeat was complete at the 22nd party congress when he was excluded from election to the Central Committee. Following Khrushchev&apos;s fall from power, Soviet leader Brezhnev brought Voroshilov out of retirement into a figurehead political post. Voroshilov was again re-elected to the Central Committee in 1966. Voroshilov was awarded a second medal of Hero of the Soviet Union 1968. He died in 1969 in Moscow and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. The KV series of tanks, used in World War II, was named after Voroshilov. Two towns were also named after him: Voroshilovgrad in Ukraine (now changed back to the historical Luhansk ) and Voroshilov in the Soviet Far East (now renamed Ussuriysk after the Ussuri river), as well as the General Staff Academy in Moscow. Stavropol was called Voroshilovsk from 1935 to 1943. Voroshilov was nominated honorary citizen of the Turkish town of Izmir in November 1933 { http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/45/794/10169.pdf }; in Izmir also a street was named after him { http://www.as-add.de/Dosya/tarih/cumhuriyet/469-InonuC2.html } (1951 renamed &quot; Plevne Bulvarı &quot; ). [ Family ] Voroshilov was married to Ekaterina Davidovna, born Golda Gorbman, who came from a Jewish Ukrainian family from Mardarovka. She changed her name when she converted to Orthodox Christianity in order to be allowed to marry Voroshilov. They met while both exiled in Arkhangelsk, where Ekaterina was sent in 1906. While both serving on the Tsaritsyn Front in 1918, where Ekaterina was helping orphans, they adopted a four year old orphan boy who they named Petya. { Larissa Vasilieva, &apos;&apos;Kremlin Wives&apos;&apos; pp 83–5 Retrieved 23 October 2009 } They also adopted the children of Mikhail Frunze, following his death in 1925. During Stalin&apos;s rule they lived in the Kremlin at the Horse Guards. { Sebag Montefiore, Simon 2004 Stalin The Court of the Red Tsar, Phoenix London ISBN 0-7538-1766-7 pp9-10 } [ Honours and awards ] [ Ворошилов, Климент Ефремович ] [ Soviet ] Hero of the Soviet Union (3 February 1956 (in conjunction with his 75th birthday), 22 February 1968 (in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the Armed Forces of the USSR)) Hero of Socialist Labour (7 May 1960) Eight Orders of Lenin (№880 - 23 February 1935, №3582 - 22 February 1938, №14851 - 3 February 1941, №26411 - 21 February 1945, №128065 - 3 February 1951, №313410 - 3 February 1956, №331807 - 3 February 1961, №340967 - 22 February 1968) Order of the Red Banner, six times (№47 - 26 June 1919, №629/2 от апреля 1921 года, №27/3 - 2 December 1925, №5/4 - 22 February 1930, №1/5 - 3 November 1944, №1/6 от 24 June 1948) Order of Suvorov, 1st class (№125 - 22 February 1944) Order of the Red Banner of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (17 February 1930) Order of the Red Banner of the Tajik SSR (№ 148 - 14 January 1933) Order of the Red Banner ZSFSR (25 February 1933) Jubilee Medal &quot;
