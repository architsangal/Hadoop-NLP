[ Comments on PETA pie incident ] On January 25, 2010, Fisheries Minister, Gail Shea was pied while giving a speech at the Canada Centre for Inland Waters. An American PETA activist, Emily McCoy, was later arrested in Burlington, charged with assault in connection with the incident. PETA has taken public responsibility for the incident, saying that it was part of a broader campaign against the Canadian Government&apos;s support of the seal hunt. { &quot; Pie in the Face &quot; } { Globe and Mail, January 26, 2010. Retrieved January 27, 2010. } In response to the pieing of the Fisheries Minister, Byrne denounced the attack on the minister as an act of terrorism. { &quot; A tofu cream pie in the face is an act of terrorism, Liberal MP tells radio station &quot;. } { National Post, January 27, 2010. } He commented on the 26th, “When someone actually coaches or conducts criminal behaviour to impose a political agenda on each and every other citizen of Canada, that does seem to me to meet the test of a terrorist organization.” Byrne continued to say, “I am calling on the Government of Canada to actually investigate whether or not this organization, PETA, is acting as a terrorist organization under the test that exists under Canadian law.” In response to his interpretation of Canadian law, PETA president Ingrid Newkirk said Byrne&apos;s reaction was &quot; a silly, chest-beating exercise. &quot; [ Liberal leadership elections ] In the Liberal Party&apos;s 2006 leadership election, Byrne started out supporting Maurizio Bevilacqua, after Bevilacque drop out he supported Michael Ignatieff. { Even Ignatieff supporters have mixed views over his Quebec ’nation’ idea } Ignatieff placed second in the race to winner Stéphane Dion.
