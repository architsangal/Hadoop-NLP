It is located in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,750. Alamo was named by the Spanish in 1850 for the poplar tree s that lined San Ramon Creek. As an unincorporated community, Alamo does not have a government of its own. Police services are provided by the Contra Costa County Office of the Sheriff. Fire and EMS services are provided by the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District. In August, 2007, a group of citizens launched a new initiative to incorporate the community, the latest in a series of attempts that go back to the early 1960s or before. Previous failed Alamo incorporation efforts always included parts of other nearby unincorporated areas: Alamo-Danville (1964) and Alamo-Danville-San Ramon (1976). This latest Alamo incorporation effort was defeated by referendum in March, 2009. [ History ] People have lived in this area for over 5,000 years. The Tatcan Indians, a Bay Miwok tribe closely connected to the Saclans of Walnut Creek, lived in Alamo in the eighteenth century. After Mission San José was founded in 1797, its grazing area stretched throughout the San Ramon Valley. The Mexican land grant Rancho San Ramon was deeded to Mariano Castro and his uncle Bartolo Pacheco in 1833. It covered today&apos;s Danville and Alamo. Castro owned the northern half, which included Alamo. In 1843 much of the Alamo, Las Trampas and Tice Valley areas were granted to brothers Inocencio and Jose Romero. It was called Rancho El Sobrante de San Ramon. Because of missing title papers, the brothers lost their ranch in American courts in 1857. Pioneers Mary Ann and John Jones traveled through Alamo in 1847. she provided the earliest English description of the area in her diary. Her husband stopped the wagon saying, &quot; Mary, look! Did you ever see anything so beautiful? &quot; She wrote later: On every side, the valley and surrounding hills were covered with thick, velvety clover, and with wild oats standing waist high waving and rippling in the summer breeze, like the bosom of a lake. [ April 2008 ] The Jones family returned to Alamo in 1851, after California had become a state. John became the first postmaster in 1852 and she applied her considerable energies to schooling children and beginning a Cumberland Presbyterian church. Other early Alamo founders included David Glass, George Engelmeyer, Silas and Susanna Stone, Captain Wall, Joshua Bollinger, and James Foster. The area was named Alamo, which means &quot; poplar &quot; or &quot; cottonwood &quot; in Spanish. Because of its location and fine weather, Alamo grew quickly. An early road from the redwoods near Moraga ran through Tice Valley to Alamo, since Americans preferred redwood for building materials instead of Mexican adobe brick. The Hemme, Bollinger, Jones and Stone ranches began by grazing cattle and raising wheat and other grains. In 1891 the Hemme train station was placed near today&apos;s Hemme Avenue; later it was renamed the Alamo station. Eventually orchards and vineyards spread across the area. Almonds, walnuts, pears, grapes and other fruit thrived in the mild climate. In 1873, Alamo pioneer Myron Hall grafted Persian cuttings to native walnut trees and helped start the prosperous walnut industry in Contra Costa County. This &quot; mother tree &quot; was tended for over 100 years. The Alamo post office is the oldest continuously operated one in the valley. It was always an important community gathering place. According to longtime postmaster Bertha Linhares, when the mail was expected the men sat in the post office-store in the winter … the women went into our sitting room and visited with my mother … We always heard all the news and troubles of the Alamo residents. [ April 2008 ] Her father, brother and sister were also postmasters from 1905 to 1960. On September 5, 2008, a 4.0 earthquake occurred in the area of Round Hill North. [ Alamo in modern times ] During World War II, an Alamo air watch tower was built by the community. Volunteers watched for Japan ese war planes round the clock from 1942 to 1945. San Ramon Valley&apos;s population totaled 2,126 at that time. The Alamo Improvement Association (AIA) began in 1953. For 50 years its purpose has been to advance and improve the welfare of properties in Alamo and to preserve the established character of Alamo as an agricultural and semi-rural residential area. After the war, hundreds and then thousands of new people arrived. Round Hill Country Club opened in 1960 on land that had belonged to the Mott sisters and Grover Squire. In 1964, Interstate 680 was completed through San Ramon Valley, which encouraged even more growth. Rapid valley growth fueled controversies. In the mid-&apos;60s, one controversy focused on the philosophy of a new, visionary superintendent of the San Ramon Unified School District, Richard L. Foster. The Superintendent of the Alamo School District, John &quot; Jock &quot; Waugh, strongly supported Richard Foster and his visionary educational philosophy. Also, debates about the pace of development led to several votes on cityhood, spearheaded by residents who wanted more local control. An Alamo-Danville incorporation election in 1964 lost 2,086 to 1,958 with &quot; loss of identity for Alamo &quot; a main concern. Today Alamo is an enclave of green with many homes on lots of [ 0.5 acre m2 ] between Walnut Creek and Danville. Its population in 2000 was 15,626.
