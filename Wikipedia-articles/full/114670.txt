When the well was completed in 1888 it was [ 109 ft m ] deep and [ 32 ft m ] in diameter. The well was used as the city&apos;s water supply until 1932. In 1939 it was opened as a tourist attraction allowing visitors to descend to the bottom of the well. The adjacent museum displayed a 1000-pound pallasite meteorite until the museum fell down around the meteorite during a 2007 tornado that destroyed the city.
