Pan&apos;s People were a British TV dance troupe, who are usually associated with the BBC TV music chart show Top of the Pops. In an era before pop video s, they danced to songs whose original artists were not available to perform them live. They were not the first dance troupe to appear regularly on TOTP; they were preceded by The Go-Jos in the programme&apos;s first four years, before Pan&apos;s People replaced them in May 1968. They did not start off with weekly appearances, but they had become an almost-weekly feature of the programme by early 1970. [ History ] Pan&apos;s People were formed in December 1966 in London. { The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald: &quot; Dee Dee&apos;s Top of the Pops memories &quot;; published 25 July 2006, accessed 11 April 2011 } Set up as a sextet { Flick Colby: Her Story in Words and Pictures }, they appeared on television series in the UK and the Netherlands before they were first approached to appear on Top of the Pops in 1968. { &quot; The Backers: Pan&apos;s People &quot; from &quot; Top of the Pops Annual 1975 &quot;, ed. Ken Irwin, World Distributors, 1974; accessed 11 April 2011 } Two dancers (Dee Dee and Ruth) from the troupe were invited to dance on TOTP by choreographer Virginia Mason in 1968 for a routine to &quot; Simon Says &quot; by the 1910 Fruitgum Company. This was followed by a further routine featuring three members of Pan&apos;s People (Dee Dee, Ruth and Flick, dancing to &quot; Respect &quot; by Aretha Franklin, and subsequently, the entire sextet appeared in a routine set to &quot; US Male &quot; by Elvis Presley. { The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald: &quot; Dee Dee&apos;s Top of the Pops memories &quot;; published 25 July 2006, accessed 11 April 2011 } [ Members ] Following a number of changes in the line up during their first year { PansPeople.com Flick Colby: Her Story in Words and Pictures &quot; PansPeople.com &quot; }, the most remembered Pan&apos;s People line-up { BBCi: TOTP2 - Pan&apos;s People; accessed 11 April 2011 } consisted of: Louise Clarke Felicity &quot; Pan&apos;s People: The Girls Who Bring Glamour To The Show &quot; from &quot; Top of the Pops Annual 1974 &quot;, ed.

Ken Irwin, World Distributors, 1974; accessed 11 April 2011 &quot; Dee Dee &quot; Wilde Colby gradually stood down from dancing duties towards the end of 1971 to concentrate full-time on choreographing the group&apos;s routines. { &quot; Pans People: The Girls Who Bring Glamour To The Show &quot; from &quot; Top of the Pops Annual 1974 &quot;, ed. Ken Irwin, World Distributors, 1973; accessed 11 April 2011 } At the end of 1972, Rutherford left Pan&apos;s People to raise a family, and was replaced by Cherry Gillespie. { &quot; Pans People: The Girls Who Bring Glamour To The Show &quot; from &quot; Top of the Pops Annual 1974 &quot;, ed. Ken Irwin, World Distributors, 1973; accessed 11 April 2011 } In mid-1974, Clarke left Pan&apos;s People to start a family. Her replacement, chosen through an open audition, was Susan &quot; Sue &quot; Menhenick. { &quot; It&apos;s Tough Being a Pan&apos;s Person &quot; from &quot; Top of the Pops Annual 1976 &quot;, ed. Ken Irwin, World Distributors, 1975; accessed 11 April 2011 } The final personnel changes within the troupe occurred during 1975, when Lord, { BBCi: TOTP2 - Pan&apos;s People; accessed 11 April 2011 } then Wilde left the group. When Lord departed, two members joined the troupe, Mary Corpe and Lee Ward. The line-up by the time of Pan&apos;s People&apos;s final routines for TOTP in April 1976 was: Mary Corpe Cherry Gillespie Sue Menhenick Lee Ward Ruth Pearson (the only remaining original member) Reveille &apos;s 26th September 1975 issue states that Dee Dee is 28, Sue is 20, Ruth is 29, Cherry is 20, Mary is 17, and Lee is 19. Shortly before the group made their last appearance on Top Of The Pops in the spring of 1976, dancer and TV presenter Lesley Judd became a temporary member of the group for a one-off routine, dancing to Rodrigo&apos;s Guitar Concerto De Aranjuez by Manuel And The Music Of The Mountains. The rehearsals and behind-the-scenes footage of the routine were featured on Blue Peter. [ Work outside TOTP ] Among other series Pan&apos;s People appeared on were: Bobbie Gentry (BBC) The Unofficial Pan&apos;s People: Moonlighting; accessed 11 April 2011 Lulu (BBC) The Unofficial Pan&apos;s People: Moonlighting; accessed 11 April 2011 The Price of Fame (BBC) The Unofficial Pan&apos;s People: Moonlighting; accessed 11 April 2011 The John Denver Show (BBC) The Unofficial Pan&apos;s People: Moonlighting; accessed 11 April 2011 The Two Ronnies (BBC) The Unofficial Pan&apos;s People: Moonlighting; accessed 11 April 2011 In 1974, Pan&apos;s People appeared in their own edition of the In Concert series for the BBC television. { The Unofficial Pan&apos;s People: Moonlighting; accessed 11 April 2011 } [ References in popular culture ] In an episode of Porridge ( &quot; A Night In &quot;, 1974), Norman Stanley Fletcher ( Ronnie Barker ) jokes to Lennie Godber ( Richard Beckinsale ) in their prison cell about having a night out: &quot; We could ring up those girls on Top of the Pops. Pan&apos;s People. There&apos;s one special one... beautiful Babs... dunno what her name is. &quot; &quot; Ronnie Barker OBE - Comic Actor and Writer &quot;, BBC website, 5 December 2005. The title is incorrectly given as &quot; A Quiet Night In &quot;. The troupe were given one of the top accolades on British TV in 1975 when they were asked to perform alongside Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise on their BBC1 Christmas Day TV Show, one of the most popular TV shows in the UK. They danced to Brenda Arnau &apos;s version of Big Spender with Morecambe &amp; Wise posing as two new Pan&apos;s Persons. The Benny Hill Show also spoofed the dance troupe as &quot; Pam&apos;s People, &quot; with Benny Hill, Henry McGee, Bob Todd, Jackie Wright and Earl Adair appearing in drag. Ironically, two later editions of his show featured the late 1970s incarnation of Pan&apos;s People, one of whom, Louise English, went on to become a major cast member of the Hill show through the mid-1980s. The Goodies made frequent references to the group, as well as showing an all-pensioner dance-troop called &quot; Pan&apos;s Grannies &quot;. In their TV series, French &amp; Saunders, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders parodied the group, with their rendition of &quot; Yellow River &quot;, with their group Pans Indeedy People. [ Life after TOTP ] Even after their departure from Top of the Pops Pan&apos;s People were much in demand for personal appearances. Dee Dee Wilde knew the name was still marketable and kept Pan&apos;s People alive as she continued to dance with and manage a new group of girls: Pauline Crawford, Abigail Higgins, Patricia McSherry, Francesca Whitburn and Sarah Woollett. A member for a short time during this period was Sarah Brightman, who went on to join the more raunchy Hot Gossip before marrying Andrew Lloyd Webber. Tracy went on to a successful career in the South Yorkshire police force, after competing in the national dressage championships. The best remembered of the original members is Babs Lord, as a result of her marriage to the actor Robert Powell and her subsequent career as an amateur yachtswoman and world explorer, having made several trips to the Himalayas, the Sahara, both Poles and the jungle in Guyana. She holds the remarkable record of being the oldest housewife to visit both the North and South Pole s. Lord was the subject of BBC&apos;s This Is Your Life in November 2001. She appeared on the final regular weekly edition of Top of the Pops on 30 July 2006, the only member of any of the show&apos;s dance troupes to appear in person at the recording. Top of the Pops continued to use professional dancers until 1981, with Colby remaining as the show&apos;s choreographer through the entire period. Pan&apos;s People were followed by a group called Ruby Flipper, which featured male and female dancers. However, there was pressure to return to the all-girl format, and after six months Legs and Co. were created, and named after a viewer competition. Both Gillespie and Mehenick from Pan&apos;s People featured in Ruby Flipper, with Mehenick going on to join Legs &amp; Co. Pearson was Legs &amp; Co&apos;s manager. Legs &amp; Co performed every week on the show until 1981, when they were replaced by Zoo – a large troupe of dancers where individual members could be selected to perform each week, depending on the song. Flick Colby became the &apos;Dance Director&apos; for Top Of The Pops at this time. By the early 1980s Zoo&apos;s role had shifted towards leading the audience, and eventually the group was disbanded, some members remaining in the crowd as strategically placed &apos;cheerleaders&apos;. In 1997, Gillespie appeared as a panelist on Channel Five&apos;s nostalgia quiz Wowfabgroovy. Colby died of bronchial pneumonia on 26 May 2011, at the age of 65.
