[ correct chemspider ] { NA } { J07 } { BD52 } The MMR vaccine is an immunization shot against measles, mumps, and rubella (also called German measles). It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman while at Merck in the late 1960s. [ Offit PA Vaccinated: One Man&apos;s Quest to Defeat the World&apos;s Deadliest Diseases Washington, DC Smithsonian 0-06-122796-X 2007 ] The vaccine is a mixture of three live attenuated virus es, administered via injection. The shot is generally administered to children around the age of one year, with a second dose before starting school (i.e. age 4/5). The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2–5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. In the United States, the vaccine was licensed in 1971 and the second dose was introduced in 1989. [ Banatvala JE, Brown DW Rubella Lancet 363 9415 1127–37 2004 15064032 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15897-2 ] It is widely used around the world; since introduction of its earliest versions in the 1970s, over 500 million doses have been used in over 60 countries. As with all vaccination s, long-term effects and efficacy are subject to continuing study. The vaccine is sold by Merck as M-M-R II, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals as Priorix, Serum Institute of India as Tresivac, and Sanofi Pasteur as Trimovax. It is usually considered a childhood vaccination. However, it is also recommended for use in some cases of adults with HIV.

[ June 2008 ] Reported cases of measles in the United States fell from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands per year following introduction of the vaccine in 1963. Increasing uptake of the vaccine following outbreaks in 1971 and 1977 brought this down to thousands of cases per year in the 1980s. An outbreak of almost 30,000 cases in 1990 led to a renewed push for vaccination and the addition of a second vaccine to the recommended schedule. Fewer than 200 cases have been reported each year since 1997, and the disease is no longer considered endemic. { Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Summary of notifable diseases—United States, 1993 Published October 21, 1994 for Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1993; 42 (No. 53) } { Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Summary of notifable diseases—United States, 2007 Published July 9, 2009 for Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 2007; 56 (No. 53) } { Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases. Atkinson W, Wolfe S, Hamborsky J, McIntyre L, eds. 11th ed. Washington DC: Public Health Foundation, 2009 } The benefit of measles vaccination in preventing illness, disability, and death has been well documented. The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of mental retardation, and 5,200 deaths. [ Bloch AB, Orenstein WA, Stetler HC et al. Health impact of measles vaccination in the United States Pediatrics 76 4 524–32 1985 3931045 ] During 1999–2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide. [ MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2006 55 9 247–9 Progress in reducing global measles deaths, 1999–2004 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 16528234 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5509a8.htm ] Measles is endemic worldwide. Although it was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, high rates of vaccination and good communication with persons who refuse vaccination is needed to prevent outbreaks and sustain the elimination of measles in the U.S. Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated individual who acquired measles during a visit to Romania. [ MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2006 55 50 1348–51 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5550a2.htm Measles—United States, 2005 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 17183226 ] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities. [ Parker AA, Staggs W, Dayan GH et al.

If mumps is acquired by a male who is past puberty, a possible complication is bilateral orchitis which can in some cases lead to sterility. [ Male infertility: a guide for the clinician Anne M. Jequier 0-632-05129-9 Malden, MA Blackwell Publishing 2000 118 http://books.google.com/?id%3DULWh1Wc1nKMC ] Rubella fell sharply when immunization was introduced. Rubella, otherwise known as German measles, was also very common before the advent of widespread vaccination. The major risk of rubella is in pregnancy. If a pregnant woman is infected, her baby may contract congenital rubella from her, which can cause significant congenital defects.

The combined MMR vaccine was introduced to induce immunity less painfully than three separate injections at the same time, and sooner and more efficiently than three injections given on different dates. In 2005, the Cochrane Library published a review of 31 scientific studies. One of its main results: &quot; We could not identify studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR that fulfilled our inclusion criteria even though the impact of mass immunisation on the elimination of the diseases has been largely demonstrated. &quot; Its authors concluded, &quot; Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with mumps and rubella. &quot; [ Development, formulation and administration ] Two workers make openings in chicken eggs in preparation for a measles vaccine The component viral strains of MMR vaccine were developed by propagation in animal and human cells. The live viruses require animal or human cells as a host for production of more virus. For example, in the case of mumps and measles viruses, the virus strains were grown in embryonated hens&apos; eggs and chick embryo cell cultures. This produced strains of virus which were adapted for the hens egg and less well-suited for human cells. These strains are therefore called attenuated strains. They are sometimes referred to as neuroattenuated because these strains are less virulent to human neurons than the wild strains.

The Cochrane Library review found that, compared to placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects. The review also found several problems in the quality of MMR vaccine safety studies, and recommended the adoption of standardized definitions of adverse events. The review&apos;s abstract concludes, &quot; The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate.
