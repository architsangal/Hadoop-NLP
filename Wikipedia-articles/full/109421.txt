As of the 2000 census, the area was known as the census-designated place of Cutler Ridge, which had a total population of 24,781. In August 1992, the area was slammed by Hurricane Andrew. In August 2005, the area was hit with serious floods from Hurricane Katrina, which by radar estimates dropped over 20  inches (500  mm) of rainfall. On January 11, 2005, residents on this unincorporated community voted to incorporate. In November 2005, residents adopted the municipal charter in which the fledgling city was renamed Cutler Bay. Both the current and former names were derived from the former town of Cutler, which existed at the turn of the century but was disincorporated during the depression. The actual location of Cutler was not within the current city limits of Cutler Bay, but was in fact two miles (3  km) to the north, east of the former Perrine and inside the boundaries of the current municipality of Palmetto Bay. In January 2006, Cutler Bay elected former Florida state legislator John F. Cosgrove as its first mayor. Mayor Cosgrove died on April 19, 2006, while vacationing in Zimbabwe. { Past National President John Cosgrove enters Chapter Eternal at 56 } Vice Mayor Paul Vrooman assumed the position of Mayor.
