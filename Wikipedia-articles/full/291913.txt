It is of a generally dark brown colour, with a pale underbelly and a dark mask across the face. Occasionally, colour mutations, including albino s and erythrist s, occur. Compared to weasel s and mink s, the polecat has a shorter, more compact body, a more powerfully built skull and dentition, and is less agile in its movements. It is much less territorial than other mustelids, with animals of the same sex frequently sharing home ranges. Like other mustelids, the European polecat is polygamous, though pregnancy occurs directly after mating, with no induced ovulation. It usually gives birth in early summer to litters consisting of five to 10 kits, which become independent at the age of two to three months. The European polecat feeds on small rodent s, bird s, amphibian s and reptile s. It occasionally cripples its prey by piercing its brain with its teeth and stores it, still living, in its burrow for future consumption. The European polecat originated in Western Europe during the Middle Pleistocene, with its closest living relatives being the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret and the European mink. With the two former species, it can produce fertile offspring, though hybrids between it and the latter species tend to be sterile, and are distinguished from their parent species by their larger size and more valuable pelts. The European polecat is the sole ancestor of the ferret, which was domesticated more than 2000 years ago for the purpose of hunting vermin. The species has otherwise been historically viewed negatively by humans. In the British Isles especially, the polecat was persecuted by gamekeeper s, and became synonymous with promiscuity in early English literature. During modern times, the polecat is still scantly represented in popular culture when compared to other rare British mammals, and misunderstandings of its behaviour still persist in some rural areas. As of 2008, it is classed by the IUCN as Least Concern due to its wide range and large numbers. [ Etymology and naming ] [ Lovegrove 2007 198 ] The word &quot; polecat &quot; first appeared after the Norman Conquest of England, written as polcat. While the second syllable is largely self-explanatory, the origin of the first is unclear. It is possibly derived from the French poule, meaning &quot; chicken &quot;, likely in reference to the species&apos; fondness for poultry, or it may be a variant of the Old English ful, meaning &quot; foul &quot;. In Old English, the species was referred to as foumart, meaning &quot; foul marten &quot;, in reference to its strong odour. In Old French, the polecat was called fissau, which was derived from the Low German and Scandinavian verb for &quot; to make a disagreeble smell &quot;. This was later corrupted in English as fitchew or fitchet, which itself became the word &quot; fitch &quot;, which is used for the polecat&apos;s pelt. [ Johnston 1903 154 ] The word fitchet is the root word for the North American fisher, which was named by Dutch colonists in America who noted similarities between the two species. [ Powell R.A. 1981 Mammalian Species: Martes pennanti The American Society of Mammologists 156:1–6 http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-156-01-0001.pdf ] A 2002 article in the The Mammal Society &apos;s Mammal Review contested the European polecat&apos;s status as an animal indigenous to the British Isles on account of a scarce fossil record and linguistic evidence. Unlike most native British mammals, the polecat&apos;s Welsh name (ffwlbart, derived from the Middle English foulmart) is not of Celtic origin, much as the Welsh names of invasive species such as the European rabbit and fallow deer (cwningen, derived from the Middle English konyng and danas, derived from the Old French dain, respectively) are of Middle English or Old French origin. Polecats are not mentioned in Anglo-Saxon or Welsh literature prior to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, with the first recorded mention of the species in the Welsh language occurring in the 14th century&apos;s Llyfr Coch Hergest and in English in Chaucer ’s The Pardoner’s Tale (1383). In contrast, attestations of the Welsh word for pine marten (bele), date back at least to the 10th century Welsh Law s and possibly much earlier in northern England. { Brown, Duncan (2002) The foulmart: what’s in a name? Mammal Rev., Volume 32, No. 2, 145–149 } [ Evolution ] { Miller &apos;s &apos;&apos;Catalogue of the Mammals of Western Europe (Europe exclusive of Russia) in the collection of the British Museum&apos;&apos; } The earliest true polecat was Mustela stromeri, which appeared during the late Villafranchian period. It was considerably smaller than the present form, thus indicating polecats evolved at a relatively late period. The oldest modern polecat fossils occur in Germany, Britain and France, and date back to the Middle Pleistocene. The European polecat&apos;s closest relatives are the steppe polecat and black-footed ferret, with which it is thought to have shared Mustela stromeri as a common ancestor. The European polecat is, however, not as maximally adapted in the direction of carnivory as the steppe polecat, being less specialised in skull structure and dentition. [ Harris Yalden 2008 480–481 ] [ Kurtén 1968 98–100 ] [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1115–1117 ] { Kurtén Björn (1980), Pleistocene mammals of North America, Columbia University Press, ISBN 0-231-03733-3 } The European polecat likely diverged from the steppe polecat 1.5 million years ago based on IRBP, though cytochrome b transversions indicate a younger date of 430,000 years. { Sato, J., T. Hosada, W. Mieczyslaw, K. Tsuchiya, Y. Yamamoto, H. Suzuki. 2003. Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among mustelids (Mammalia: Carnivora) based on nucleotide sequences of the nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein and mitochondrial cytochrome b genes. Zoologial Science, 20: 243-264. } It is also closely related to the European mink, with which it can hybridise. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1086–1088 ] [ Domestication ] { Queen Mary Psalter } Morphological, cytological and molecular studies confirm the European polecat is the sole ancestor of the ferret, thus disproving any connection with the steppe polecat, which was once thought to have contributed to the ferret&apos;s creation. Ferrets were first mentioned by Aristophanes in 450 BC and by Aristotle in 350 BC. Greek and Roman writers in the first century AD were the first to attest on the ferret&apos;s use in bolting rabbit s from their burrows. The first accurate descriptions of ferrets come from Strabo during 200 AD, when ferrets were released onto the Balearic Islands to control rabbit populations. As the European rabbit is native to the Iberian Peninsula and northwest Africa, the European polecat likely was first domesticated in these regions. [ Lewington 2000 3–5 ] The ferret and European polecat are similar in both size and portions, to the point that dark-coloured ferrets are almost indistinguishable from their wild cousins, though the ferret&apos;s skull has a smaller cranial volume, and has a narrower postorbital constriction. [ Harris Yalden 2008 485–487 ] Compared to the European polecat, the ferret has a much smaller brain, though this comparison has not been made with Mediterranean polecats, from which ferrets likely derive. [ Hemmer 1990 108 ] The theory of a Mediterranean origin is further strengthened because the ferret is less tolerant of cold than northern polecat subspecies. [ Clutton-Brock, J. A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals 1987 208 0-521-34697-5 British Museum (Natural History) London ] The ferret is also more fertile than the polecat, producing two or more litters annually, as opposed to just one. { Bednarz M. Observations on reproduction in polecat and ferret hybrids (abstract). Anim Breed 1962;30:239. } { Bednarz M. Preliminary observations on the growth and development of polecat and ferret hybrids&apos;&apos; (abstract). Anim Breed 1962;30:239 } Unlike other subspecies, which are largely solitary, the ferret will readily live in social groups. [ http://www.weaselwords.com/page/ferret_art036.php Inherited behavior traits of the domesticated ferret Brown Susan, A weaselwords.com 29 January 2010 ] The ferret is also slower in all its movements than the polecat, and hardly ever makes any use of its anal scent glands. [ Hemmer 1990 86 ] Overall, the ferret represents a neotenous form of polecat. [ Lewington 2000 93 ] [ Subspecies ] [ 2005 on ], [ 14001460 ] seven subspecies are recognised.

[ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1108 ] [ Miller 1912 419 ] The tail is short, about ⅓ its body length. The eyes are small, with dark brown iris es. The hind toes are long and partially webbed, with weakly curved 4  mm-long, nonretractable claws. The front claws are strongly curved, partially retractable, and measure 6  mm in length. [ Harris Yalden 2008 477 ] The feet are moderately long and more robust than in other members of the genus. The polecat&apos;s skull is relatively coarse and massive, moreso than the mink&apos;s, with a strong, but short and broad facial region and strongly developed projections. In comparison to other similarly sized mustelids, the polecat&apos;s teeth are very strong, large and massive in relation to skull size. Sexual dimorphism in the skull is apparent in the lighter, narrower skull of the female, which also has weaker projections. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1112–1113 ] The polecat&apos;s running gait is not as complex and twisting as that of the mink or stoat, and it is not as fast as the mountain weasel (solongoi), stoat or least weasel, as it can be outrun by a conditioned man. Its sensory organs are well developed, though it is unable to distinguish between colours. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1130 ] The dimensions of the European polecat vary greatly. The species does not conform to Bergmann&apos;s rule, with the pattern of size variation seeming to follow a trend of size increase along an east-west axis. { De Marinis, Anna M. (1995) Craniometric variability of polecat Mustela putorius L. 1758 from North-Central Italy., Hystrix, (n.s.) 7 (1-2) (1995): 57-68 } Males measure 350–460  mm in body length and females are 290–394  mm. The tail measures 115–167  mm in males and 84–150  mm in females. Adult males in middle Europe weigh 1,000-1,500  grams and females 650-815  grams. Gigantism is known among polecats, but specimens exhibiting this are likely the products of polecat-mink hybrid isation. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1114–1115 ] [ Fur ] { Surrey, } { England } The winter fur of the European polecat is brownish-black or blackish-brown, the intensity of which is determined by the colour of the long guard hairs. On the back and flanks, the dark tone is brightened by bright whitish-yellowish, sometimes yellowish-greyish underfur which shows through. The lightly coloured underfur is not equally visible on different parts of the body. On the back and hindquarters, the underfur is almost completely covered by the dark guard hairs. On the flanks, though, the lightening is well defined, and contrasts sharply with the general tone of the back. The throat, lower neck, chest and abdomen are black or blackish-brown. The limbs are pure black or black with brown tints, while the tail is black or blackish-brown, completely lacking light underfur. The area around and between the eyes is black-brown, with a longitudinal stripe of similar colour along the top of the nose. The ears are dark brown and edged with white. The summer fur is short, sparse and coarse. It is greyer, duller and lacking in the lustre of the winter fur. The underfur is more weakly developed in the summer fur, and has a brownish-grey or rusty-grey colour. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1109–1111 ] The polecat is a good swimmer, but its fur is not as well insulated against cold water as the American mink &apos;s; while a mink will take 118 minutes to cool in a water temperature of 8°C, the polecat cools down much faster at 26–28 minutes. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1411 ] Colour mutations include albino s and erythrist s. In typical erythristic individuals, the underfur is usually bright reddish. The guard hairs on the trunk are bright reddish or reddish-brown. Black guard hairs are absent on the lower body and head. In some rare cases, the guard hairs are so light, they are almost indistinguishable from the pale-yellow underfur. In these cases, the whole animal is a very light golden-yellow colour. [ Behaviour ] { Sweden } [ Social and territorial behaviours ] Unlike the steppe polecat, the European polecat has a much more settled way of life, with definite home ranges. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1129 ] The characteristics of polecat home ranges vary according to season, habitat, sex and social status. Breeding females settle in discreet areas, whereas breeding males and dispersing juveniles have more fluid ranges, being more mobile. Males typically have larger territories than females. Each polecat uses several den sites distributed throughout its territory. Occasionally, abandoned European badger or red fox burrows are used. Rabbit warrens are often areas of intense polecat activity. In winter, the polecat may use farm buildings or haystacks as daytime resting sites. The polecat is not as territorial as other small mustelids, having been known to share territories with other members of the same sex. Evidence of polecats marking their territories is sparce. Like other mustelids, the polecat is usually a silent animal, though it will growl fiercely when angered, and squeak when distressed. It also emits a low, mewling cry to its mate or offspring. [ Johnston 1903 155 ] [ Reproduction and development ] The European polecat is a seasonal breeder, with no courtship rituals. During the mating season, the male grabs the female by the neck and drags her about to stimulate ovulation, then copulates for up to an hour. The species is polygamous, with each male polecat mating with several females. Unlike with other small mustelids, ovulation is not induced, and pregnancy occurs immediately after mating. The gestation period lasts 40–43 days, with litters usually being born in May-early June. Each litter typically consists of five to 10 kits. At birth, the kits weigh 9-10  g and measure 55–70  mm in body length; they are blind and deaf. At the age of one week, the kits are covered in silky, white fur, which is replaced with a cinnamon brown-greyish woolly coat at the age of 3–4 wk. Weaning begins at three weeks of age, while the permanent dentition erupts after 7–8 wk. The kits become independent after two to three months. [ Harris Yalden 2008 482–483 ] Females are very protective of their young, and have even been known to confront humans approaching too closely to their litters. [ Brehm 1895 158 ] [ Ecology ] { least weasel, as painted by } { Archibald Thorburn } [ Diet ] { grey partridge, as exhibited at the } { Bulgarian National Museum of Natural History } The European polecat&apos;s diet consists of mouse -like rodent s, followed by amphibian s and bird s. Its most frequent prey item in the former Soviet Union is the common vole and rarely the red-backed vole. In large river floodlands, water vole are common prey. In winter, amphibians (especially grass frogs and green toad s ) become important food items. However, because amphibians have little calorific value, the polecat never grows fat on them, no matter how many it consumes. Bird species preyed upon by the European polecat include chicken s, pigeon s, quail, grey partridge s, grouse and various small birds. Some species only rarely preyed upon by the polecat include European hedgehog s, asp viper s, grass snake s and insect s. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1127–1129 ] In the British Isles, it commonly kills brown rat s and European rabbit s, and is capable of killing larger prey, such as geese and hare s. One polecat was reported to frequently wait at a riverbank and catch eels, which it took back to its burrow. [ Lydekker 1896 115 ] The polecat feeds on eels mostly during lengthy frosts when eels, unable to breathe air at regular intervals because of the ice, congregate at breathing holes. Unlike the stoat and weasel, the polecat readily eats carrion, including that of large ungulate s. { Zoologist: a monthly journal of natural history, Volume 4 (1846) } The European polecat hunts its prey by stalking it and seizing it with its canine teeth, killing the animal with a bite to the neck. This killing method is instinctive, but perfected with practice. The polecat sometimes caches its food, particularly during seasonal gluts of frogs and toads. Sometimes, the polecat does not kill these, but bites them at the base of the skull, thus paralyzing them and keeping them fresh for later consumption. Though they are normally shy around humans, naturalist Alfred Brehm in his Brehms Tierleben mentions an exceptional case in which three polecats attacked a baby in Hesse. During the winter period, when live prey is scarce, the European polecat may raid beehive s and feed on the honey. { Maxwell, William Hamilton (1833) The field book: or, Sports and pastimes of the United kingdom; comp. from the best authorities, ancient and modern, E. Wilson } [ Enemies and competitors ] The polecat may be preyed upon by red fox es, and both wild and domestic cat s. { Heptner, V. G. &amp; Sludskii, A. A. 1992. &apos;&apos;Mammals of the Soviet Union. Vol. II, part 2, Carnivores(Feloidea)&apos;&apos;, Leiden, E. J. Brill. 784 pp. ISBN 90-04-08876-8 } Although the polecat can coexist with the European mink (though there is one record of a polecat attacking a European mink and dragging it to its burrow [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1104–1105 ] ), it suffers in areas where the invasive American mink also occurs, as the latter species feeds on the same mammalian species as the polecat much more frequently than the European mink, and has been known to drive the polecat out of wetland habitats. { Sidorovich, V. E., MacDonald, D. W., Kruuk, H. &amp; Krasko, A., 2000. Behavioural interactions between the naturalized American mink Mustela vison and the native riparian mustelids, NE Belarus, with implications for population changes. Small Carnivore Conservation, 22: 1–5. } In areas where the European polecat is sympatric with the steppe polecat, the two species overlap greatly in choice of food, though the former tends to consume more household foods and birds, while the latter preys on mammals more frequently. { Lanszki, J.; Heltai, M. Diet of the European polecat and the steppe polecat in Hungary, 2007, Mammalian Biology 72: 49-53 } There is at least one record of a beech marten killing a polecat. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 902 ] The European polecat may prey on the much smaller least weasel. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 992 ] [ Hybridisation ] [ Polecat-ferret hybrid Polecat-mink hybrid ] Heads of a &apos;&apos;&apos;1)&apos;&apos;&apos; polecat, &apos;&apos;&apos;2)&apos;&apos;&apos; ferret and &apos;&apos;&apos;3)&apos;&apos;&apos; polecat-ferret hybrid [ right... ecologically, polecat-European mink hybrids are indeed something between the European mink and polecat. Hybrids acted both as a semiaquatic predator like the European mink, and as a more terrestrial predator, like the polecat. They changed feeding habits between being a generalist predator basing its diet on amphibians, small rodents and birds (like the polecat) to being a frog eater similar to the European mink. Even in daily activity hybrids were intermediate between the two hybridized species. Vadim E. Sidorovich, of the IUCN/SSC Mustelid, Viverrid &amp; Procyonid Specialist Group ] In some parts of the British Isles, the abandoning of domestic ferret s has led to ferret-polecat crossbreeds living in the wild. Ferrets were likely first brought to Britain after the Norman Conquest of England, or as late as the fourteenth century. { Davison, A., et al. (1999) Hybridization and the phylogenetic relationship between polecats and domestic ferrets in Britain, Biological Conservation 87 :155-161 } It is currently impossible to distinguish pure polecats from hybrids through DNA analysis, as the two forms are too closely related and intermixed to be separated through modern genetic methods. { Polecat FAQs © The Vincent Wildlife Trust 2010 } Crossbreeds between the two animals typically have a distinct white throat patch, white feet and white hairs interspersed among the fur. Typically, first generation crossbreeds between polecats and ferrets develop their wild parents&apos; fear of humans if left with their mothers during the critical socialisation period between 7½ and 8½ weeks of age. { Poole TB (1972) Some behavioral differences between European polecat, Mustela putorius, ferret, M furo, and their hybrids. J. Zool 166:25–35 } Occasionally, supposed ferret-polecat crossbreeds are advertised as superior to pure ferrets for the purposes of rabbiting, though actual crossbreeds are very likely to be less handleable, less willing to familiarise themselves with dogs, and are more likely to kill their quarry outright rather than simply flush it from its burrow. { Plummer, David Brian (2001) In Pursuit of Coney, Coch Y Bonddu Books, ISBN 0-9533648-8-7 } Polecats are able to hybridise with the rare European mink, producing offspring termed khor&apos;-tumak by furriers and khonorik by fanciers. [ http://www.ferret.ru/eng/khonorik.html Khonorik: Hybrids between Mustelidae Russian Ferret Society 9 May 2011 ] Such hybridisation is very rare in the wild, and typically only occurs where European minks are declining. A polecat-mink hybrid has a poorly defined facial mask, yellow fur on the ears, grey-yellow underfur and long, dark brown guard hairs. It is fairly large, with a male attaining the peak sizes known for European polecats (weighing 1,120-1,746 g and measuring 41–47  cm in length), and a female is much larger than female European minks (weighing 742 g and measuring 37  cm in length). { Sidorovich, V. (2001) Finding on the ecology of hybrids between the European mink Mustela lutreola and polecat M. putorius at the Lovat upper reaches, NE Belarus Small Carnivore Conservation 24: 1-5 } The majority of polecat-mink hybrids have skulls bearing greater similarities to those of polecats than to minks. Hybrids can swim well like minks and burrow for food like polecats. They are very difficult to tame and breed, as males are sterile, though females are fertile. { Tumanov, Igor L. &amp; Abramov, Alexei V. (2002) &apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;A study of the hybrids between the European Mink&apos;&apos; Mustela lutreola &apos;&apos;and the Polecat&apos;&apos; M. putorius Small Carnivore Conservation 27: 29-31 } The first captive polecat-mink hybrid was created in 1978 by Soviet zoologist Dr. Dmitry Ternovsky of Novosibirsk. Originally bred for their fur (which was more valuable than that of either parent species), the breeding of these hybrids declined as European mink populations decreased. Studies on the behavioural ecology of free-ranging polecat-mink hybrids in the upper reaches of the Lovat River indicate hybrids will stray from aquatic habitats more readily than pure minks, and will tolerate both parent species entering their territories, though the hybrid&apos;s larger size (especially the male&apos;s) may deter intrusion. During the summer period, the diets of wild polecat-mink hybrids are more similar to those of minks than to the polecats, as they feed predominantly on frogs. During the winter, their diets overlap more with those of polecats, and will eat a larger proportion of rodents than in the summer, though they still rely heavily on frogs and rarely scavenge ungulate carcasses as polecats do. The European polecat can also hybridise with the Asian steppe polecat or the North American black-footed ferret to produce fertile offspring. European-steppe polecat hybrids are very rare, despite their sympatry in several areas. Nevertheless, hybrids have been recorded in southern Ukraine, the Kursk and Voronezh Oblast s, the Trans- Carpathians and several other localities. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1144–1145 ] [ Range, history and conservation ] The European polecat is widespread in the western Palaearctic to the Urals in the Russian Federation, though it is absent from Ireland, northern Scandinavia, and much of the Balkans and eastern Adriatic coast. It occurs only marginally in northern Greece. It is found in Morocco in the Rif Mountains, from sea level to 2400 m. Its domesticated form, the ferret, was introduced in Britain, and some Mediterranean islands and New Zealand. [ British Isles ] [ Lovegrove 2007 200 ] In Britain, the European polecat was regarded as a serious poultry predator prior to the introduction of wire netting, therefore eliminating it was considered the only option to protect stock. In Kent, for example, at least 42 parish es paid bounties for polecats, of which three extened into the 19th century, though by this time only single individuals were recorded, and usually after gaps of many years. In the Kingdom of Scotland, during the reign of David II, an export duty of 4 d. was imposed on each polecat fur trimmer, which was raised to 8d. in 1424. The species held an important place in Scotland&apos;s fur markets; the annual Dumfries Fur Fair (1816–1874) sold 400 polecat pelts in 1829 and 600 in 1831. The following year, a contemporary account described polecat skins as &quot; a drug on the market &quot;. In 1856, the number of sold pelts decreased to 240, 168 in 1860, 12 in 1866 and none in 1869. [ Ritchie 1920 162 ] The decline was halted with the decrease in the intensity of gamekeeping during the 20 year interval between the First and Second World War s. [ Lovegrove 2007 275=276 ] In modern times, the European polecat is found throughout most of rural Wales and in England from Cheshire south to Avon, and east to Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. The species was reintroduced into Cumbria, Argyll and on Speyside during the 1970s and 1980s, though the current status of these populations is unknown. Its modern distribution is unclear to a certain extent because of the presence of polecat-ferret hybrids. Aside from the reintroductions, factors aiding the recovery of British polecat populations include an increase in rabbit populations and a lessening of persecution by gamekeepers. Its population has been considered viable since the mid-1990s. The European polecat is afforded both national and European protection; it is listed onSchedule 6 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and Regulation 41 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp; c.) Regulations 1994 and is listed on Annex V of the Habitats Directive. { Joint Nature Conservation Committee. 2007. Second Report by the UK under Article 17 on the implementation of the Habitats, Directive from January 2001 to December 2006. Peterborough: JNCC. Available from: www.jncc.gov.uk/article17 } [ France ] The European polecat is present in all of France&apos;s territories, excepting Corsica, and has been in a state of decline for several decades. Nevertheless, it is listed as Least Concern on France&apos;s Red Data Book. The European polecat is rare in numerous regions or département s. In the Rhone - Alps region, its population has undergone a sizeable decline since the 1990s, largely as a consequence of poisoning campaigns against muskrat s. A 1999 study on the decline of polecats in this region indicated the species has little chance of surviving there. Elsewhere, it is considered either rare or sporadic in 22 districts and absent or extirpated in 22 others. In Drôme, for example, polecat populations have been decreasing since 1975, and have disappeared in 27 communes in Isère. Its numbers are declining in Morvan and Ariège, and is thinly distributed in Brittany. Though present in Aquitaine, its numbers have been dropping since the 1950s, and is very rare in the mountain regions. In Normandy, the speed of the polecat&apos;s decline has somewhat decreased. In the alpine départements, its range is limited by altitude, as the species relies on more Mediterranean climates to thrive. It is, however, especially abundant in the irrigated Crau, but is absent on the eastern part of the area, apparently being restricted by the valleys of the Durance and Rhone Rivers. The largest populations occur in Northern France : Pas de Calais, Central France; Alsace, Lorraine and the areas of the Loire with the Vendée, which holds the largest record of polecat observations. It is common in all the départements of Champagne-Ardenne. { Soubelet, A.

Service du Patrimoine Naturel, Muséum National d&apos;Histoire Naturelle } [ Former Soviet Union ] The western border of the European polecat&apos;s range in the former Soviet Union begins from the mouth of the Danube in the south approximately to northwest of Suoyarvi, on the Finnish border in the north. In Karelia, its northern border extends from the former point towards the southeast to the Spassk Bay of Lake Onega, thereby passing around the West Karelian uplands from the south and then, passing around these uplands from the east, it suddenly ascends directly to the north passing in particular, near the western shore of Segozer and reaches Rugozer. From there, the border line turns northeast, crossing the Lakhta and reaching Kem on the White Sea. From Archangelsk, the border reaches Mezen, thus attaining the species&apos; most northerly range. From the Mezen River &apos;s mouth, the border abruptly returns south, approaching closer to the upper Mezen near 64° lat. From there, the polecat&apos;s northern border goes on to the upper Vychegda River, and descends further on southwards and in the Urals. Its eastern range apparently extends along the Urals, embracing Sverdlovsk from the west. It is probably absent in the southern Urals, where the steppe polecat occurs. The southern border of the polecat&apos;s range starts in the west of the Danube&apos;s mouth and extends eastward along the coast of the Black Sea reaching the mouth of the Dnepr, from which it moves back from the shore of the Azov Sea and, along it, goes to the mouth of the Don. From the mouth and lower course of the Don, its range passes into the steppe region of western and middle Ciscaucasia. The European polecat is absent from the Saratov steppes of Transvolga, instead being encountered only in the extreme lower Bolshoy and Maly Irgiz River s. Further on, the border goes to the north along the Volga River. It steeply returns east somewhat south at the Samara bend, passing around Obshchy Syrt, reaching the Urals at the latitude of Magnitogorsk. Due to a possible combination of global warming and habitat modification, the range of the polecat within the former Soviet Union has expanded northwards. From 1930-1952 for example, the polecat colonised northwestern Karelia and southern Finland. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1117–1122 ] Prior to the First World War, the Russian Empire produced more than 50% of global polecat skins. The harvesting of polecats in Russia increased substantially after the October Revolution, which coincided with Western Europe&apos;s decline in polecat numbers. The Russian population of polecats decreased somewhat after the Second World War, and their hunting was subsequently discouraged, as polecats were acknowledged to limit harmful rodent populations. [ Diseases and parasites ] The European polecat may suffer from distemper, influenza, the common cold and pneumonia. Occasionally, it is affected by malignant tumour s and hydrocephaly. It commonly has broken teeth and, on rarer occasions, fatal abscess s on the jaw, head and neck. In mainland Europe, it is a carrier of trichinosis, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis and adiaspiromycosis. Incidences of polecats carrying rabies are high in some localized areas. [ Harris Yalden 2008 484 ] Ectoparasite s known to infest polecats include flea species such as Ctenocephalides felis, Archaeospylla erinacei, Nosopsyllus fasciatus and Paraceras melis. The tick Ixodes hexagonus is the polecat&apos;s most common ectoparasite, which is sometimes found in large numbers on the neck and behind the ears. Another, less common species to infest polecats is I. canisuga. The biting louse Trichodectes jacobi is also known to infest polecats. Endoparasite s carried by polecats include the cestode s Taenia tenuicollis and T. martis and the nematode s Molineus patens, Strongyloides papillosus, Capilliaria putorii, Filaroides martis and Skjrabingylus nasicola. [ Relationships with humans ] [ Hunting and fur use ] { Copenhagen } [ right The polecat has earned for itself a most unenviable fame, having been long celebrated as one of the most noxious pests to which the farmyard is liable. Slightly smaller than the marten, and not quite so powerful, it is found to be a more deadly enemy to rabbits, game and poultry, than any other animal its size. John George Wood Wood, Rev. J. G. (1870) Wood&apos;s Animal Kingdom ] European polecat hunting was once a favourite sport of the Westmoreland dalesmen and the Scot s, who hunted them at night in midwinter. However, the majority of polecat deaths caused by humans have been accidental, having mostly been caused by steel traps set for rabbits. [ Lydekker 1896 114 ] Hunting polecats by moonlight was also a popular diversion among midland schoolboys. Until the mid-19th century, polecats in Britain were hunted from early February to late April with mixed packs of hunting dog s on the Welsh hills and Lakeland fells, though otterhound s were used on the fells, the Border country and the Scottish Lowlands. { Perry, Richard (1978) Wildlife in Britain and Ireland, Taylor &amp; Francis, ISBN 0-85664-306-8 } John Tucker Edwardes, the creator of the Sealyham terrier, used captured wild male polecats to test the gameness of yearling terriers. { Plummer, David Brian &amp; Knowleden, Martin (2000) Tales of a Rat-Hunting Man, Coch Y Bonddu Books, ISBN 0-9533648-7-9 } In the former Soviet Union, polecats are hunted chiefly in late autumn and early winter with gun s and hunting dogs, as well as foothold trap s and wooden snares. However, even in season, hunters rarely catch more than 10-15 polecats. The species does not constitute an important element in former Soviet commercial hunting, and is usually only caught incidentally. The European polecat is a valuable fur bearer, whose pelt (fitch) is more valuable than the steppe polecat&apos;s. [ Heptner Sludskii 2002 1133–1134 ] Its skin is used primarily in the production of jacket s, cape s and coat s. It is particularly well suited for trim mings for women&apos;s clothing. The tail is sometimes used for the making of paintbrush es. [ Bachrach 1953 348–352 ] One disadvantage of polecat skin, however, is its unpleasant odour, which is difficult to remove. The European polecat was first commercially farmed for its fur in Great Britain during the 1920s, but was only elevated to economic importance in Finland in 1979. It never became popular in the USA and Canada, due to import laws regarding non-native species. It did gain economic importance in the USSR, though. { Roth, Harald H.; Merz, Günter (1997) Wildlife resources: a global account of economic use, Springer, ISBN 3-540-61357-9 } Welsh polecat being fed at the British Wildlife Centre, Newchapel, Surrey [ Tameability ] Unlike the stoat and least weasel, the European polecat is easy to breed in captivity. According to Aubyn Trevor-Battye, the European polecat is difficult to tame, but is superior to its domesticated form, the ferret, in bolting rats from their holes due to its greater agility. It is prone to attempting escape once finished bolting rats, but can be easily outrun. [ Lydekker 1896 116 ] Polecat kits can be successfully raised and suckled by mother cat s. According to Owen&apos;s Welsh Dictionary, the Gwythelians (early Irish settlers in northern Wales) kept polecats as pets. { Sullivan, Jeremiah (1857) Cumberland &amp; Westmorland, ancient &amp; modern: the people, dialect, superstitions and customs, Whittaker and co. } Attempts to tame the European polecat are generally hampered by the adult&apos;s nervous and unsociable disposition. First generation hybrids between polecats and ferrets, conceived to improve the latter&apos;s bloodlines, produce animals with personalities similar to their wild parents. [ In culture ] In the British Isles, the polecat historically has had a negative reputation. References to the polecat in early English literature are often vilifying, usually being synonymous with prostitute s and generally immoral people, as is the case in Shakespeare &apos;s The Merry Wives of Windsor : &quot; Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you polecat, you runyon! &quot; In some rural areas, the belief persists that the polecat chews off the ears of sleeping sheep and can paralyse or kill men by jumping on them from behind and biting their necks. However, in some regions, it was widely believed among farmers that allowing a polecat to nest in a chicken coop would ensure the animal would not kill the poultry out of gratitude, and instead kill vermin. Cases in which polecats did kill poultry were attributed to animals which were guests at other farms. In Wales, polecats were widely believed to migrate in large numbers every spring to the great peat bog of Tregaron to feed on the breeding frogs there. This was later proven to be incorrect, as the climate in Tregaron is too wet for the European polecat, and it does not hold large frog populations. Compared to other British carnivores, such as otter s and badger s, the polecat has received little exposure in popular media. A study conducted on rural school children showed only 3.8% of the surveyed children could identify polecats on photographs, whereas 83.7% correctly identified otters. { Bidder, Owen (2009), &apos;&apos;The European Polecat: Unsung Species&apos;&apos;, Natur Cymru, Summer/Haf 09 } In the tooltip text (also known as mouseover or (inaccurately) alt -text) of the xkcd comic Networking, Randall Munroe compares business to polecats by saying, &quot; Our company is agile and lean with a focus on the long tail. Ok, our company is actually a polecat I found in my backyard. &quot; { Munroe, Randall.
