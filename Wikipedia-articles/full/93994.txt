Erith&apos;s town centre has undergone a series of modernisations since 1961. Erith is geographically an outer lying area of London, although it is can be seen as having many of the characteristics of the Inner city, namely most residences consisting largely of flats and council blocks, with fewer houses, and shops and other commercial properties interspersed between. [ History ] [ Pre-medieval ] Work at the former British Gypsum site in Church Manorway by the Museum of London Archaeological Service showed that the area had a dense forest of oak, yew and alder during the Neolithic Period, which by the Bronze Age had given way in part to sedge fen. { Museum of London summary of archaeological work carried out in 2001 accessed 6 April 2008 } { London Borough of Bexley (yellow) } Their work at the former site of Erith School in Belmont Road revealed the presence of prehistoric settlement, and of a substantial settlement or farmstead dating from the first century. { Museum of London summary of archaeological work carried out in 1996 accessed 6 April 2008 } Following the collapse of Roman rule at the beginning of the 5th Century, Britain was colonised by invaders from northern Europe called the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle tells us that they won the Battle of Crayford in 457, slaying many men in the process, and shortly after claimed the whole of Kent. Their different way of life was reflected in their pattern of settlement. The town and country estates of the Roman bureaucrats gave way to a network of villages, occupied by warriors and farmers. Erith was one of these villages, and has a Saxon name, thought to have been derived from a word meaning `muddy harbour&apos; or `gravelly landing place&apos;. There was probably a church on the site of the present St John the Baptist church during Roman times and almost certainly a Saxon building. { http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-198724-parish-church-of-st-john-the-baptish-bex } The early settlement was based around this church, meaning that the centre of Erith was once west of its current location. [ Medieval ] The earliest reference to the area is in a Latin charter of 695 recording a grant by the Bishop of the East Saxons of certain lands at Erith. In early times, the area may also have been known as Lesnes or Lessness. After the Norman Conquest in 1066, Erith passed into the possession of Bishop Odo and is mentioned in the Domesday Survey. In 1315, a Royal Charter was granted for a market to be held in Erith every Thursday. However, it was noted in 1776 that the market had long been discontinued. { Bexley Local Studies Note 51 - Historical References to Erith Market accessed 6 June 2008 } Erith owes its existence to the Thames and was, until the 1850s, essentially a small riverside port, given prominence by King Henry VIII &apos;s decision to open a naval dockyard in the town. The position of the dockyard is approximately, where the &apos;Riverside Gardens&apos; are now. His famous warship, Henri Grace à Dieu, was fitted out there in 1515. { http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bexley/assets/histories/erith } At that time, and until the 19th Century, Erith was a popular anchorage. Ships often discharged some cargo here before proceeding through the shallows upstream. [ Industrial era ] In 1797 Edward Hasted described Erith as &apos;consisting of one small street of houses, which leads to the water side&apos;, and mentions two annual fairs, on Ascension Day and Michaelmas Day. { &apos;The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 2&apos; (E.Hasted), on british-history.ac.uk accessed 6 March 2008 } In 1831 Erith&apos;s population was 1533 people, and it was described (in 1840), as being &apos;composed chiefly of two streets, one leading down to the water side, the other branching off to the left towards the church&apos;. { &apos;Pigots 1840&apos;, on website freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~shebra/pigots_1840 accessed 5 December 2007 } The Local Government Act 1894 brought into existence Erith Urban District, which became the Municipal Borough of Erith in 1938. It included Northumberland Heath and Belvedere. In 1849, Erith enjoyed a short time as a riverside resort. It&apos;s pier and nearby hotel gave hospitality for the many day-tripper s who visited the town via the Thames pleasure boats or via the railway. { Carnegie United Kingdom Trust. It was re-furbished and re-opened in September 2000. The building also housed the Erith Museum which is currently closed } [ Twentieth century ] Engineering became a prominent industry around Erith, with armaments and cable production being the main supplies. Vickers was a major employer and was linked to the Royal Arsenal at nearby Woolwich. Another local firm, Callender&apos;s Cables(Later British Insulated Callender&apos;s Cables ) supplied the world with high-class cable and also laid an underwater pipeline across the English Channel (see Submarine communications cable ). Fuel supplied through this pipeline was used by Allied vehicles during the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944. The town was bombed heavily during the Second World War, mainly due its position both on the riverside and near to Royal Arsenal. Because of the bomb damage and the gradual decline in local trade, after the war there was a major redevelopment of the town in the 1960s. In 1961, plans were put forward by local planners to redevelop Erith into a modern, sleek shopping and working environment. This involved clearing the substandard housing by the riverside and the old street layout in order to accommodate more cars. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the Erith Municipal Borough was abolished and its area transferred to Greater London to form part of the present-day London Borough of Bexley. The new boundary of the city went far beyond the original London postal districts. Royal Mail decided not to echo this change by expanding the London postal district, due to cost considerations. Therefore Erith (along with the majority of Bexley Borough) does not come under the SE postcode area and continues to be serviced from Dartford, Kent, with DA postal codes. Demolition of the old town started in 1966, when the mayor of Bexley smashed Headley Mitchells shop window, and continued in phases until 1980, leaving few reminders of the old town centre (viz: Queens Church, The Cross Keys pub, police station, the Carnegie Library and Christ Church). Many of the original Victorian buildings were lost but some of the original townscape remains, from the White Hart in the High Street through to St John&apos;s Church in West Street. From the river front there are two point block residential towers opened in the early seventies, the playhouse (begun in 1973) and two rather drab shopping centres (1969 and 1973). Recently, these shopping centres have been refaced and extended to provide new social housing and better quality shops to complement the W.M.Morrison&apos;s supermarket to the east of town in an attempt to make Erith more attractive and welcoming. The site formerly used by outdoor markets became a car park serving the improved pedestrianised centre. In 1975/76, everything to the south of Pier Road was swept away for more modern housing and a new dual carriageway, which still stands today. In 1996, the two sites of Erith School, the East and West buildings, merged onto one site on Avenue Road. In 2005, the school was awarded Specialist Schools status by the Government, recognising its excellence in PE, Maths and ICT. A new sixth form block opened in 2007. Its Community Sports Centre is used during the evenings and weekends by a variety of teams. Some fairly new riverside apartment blocks, just east of Erith town centre and facing the pier [ Regeneration ] Since the late 1990s Erith has been undergoing significant changes with the Erith Western Thames Gateway { http://www.bexley.gov.uk/service/erithwesterngateway/index.html } project being the culmination of a number of years of regeneration. The regeneration of the area falls within the remit of the Thames Gateway project, with Erith being a key focus { http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/03/08/thamesgateway_bexley_opinion_feature.shtml } for Bexley Council as its only population centre on the River Thames. Since 2000 a significant number of new flats have been constructed by the River Thames by private companies such as George Wimpy. It is expected that the Erith Western Gateway, that will include a significant number of new riverside flats, { http://www.thamesgateway.gov.uk/index.html?rm=news &amp; article=22 &amp; PHPSESSID=986aa54265aa061b23cb5883448aae85 } will continue to rejuvenate the area which suffered from the blight of post World War Two rebuilding. The area under consideration in the Erith Western Gateway is a large, underused area of the town centre. Bexley Council are seeking to provide a mixed use development with the potential for 6,000 square metres of new commercial space and over 500 new homes. Erith Riverside Shopping Centre The London Borough of Bexley announced the selection of Crest Nicholson /Orbit South to take forward the Erith Western Gateway regeneration scheme. The timing and construction of the gateway is uncertain. [ Industries ] Erith Iron Works was established in 1864 in Anchor Bay by William Anderson. { Bexley Local Studies Note 66 &apos;Sir William Anderson&apos; accessed 6 June 2008 } From 1881 Erith was home to a large cable works founded by William Callender. This became British Insulated Callender&apos;s Cables (BICC), and eventually Pirelli who announced its partial closure in 2003. The remainder became Prysmian. During the First World War Erith was an extremely important area for the manufacture of guns and ammunition, largely due to the presence of the large Vickers works in the Fraser Road area.In the Second World War, Erith found itself in the thick of the conflict, being directly on the German bombing routes from Europe to London, and also because of the nearby armament factories. { Bexley Local Studies Note No. 11 - Erith accessed 6 June 2008 } For many decades Erith has been the site of the Erith Oil Works, originally British Oil &amp; Cake Mills (BOCM) and now owned by ADM, which processes various seeds into vegetable oils [ Sport and leisure ] { Thames } A new swimming pool was recently built adjoining the sports centre and the David Ives Stadium, { http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=erith } which is home to Bexley Athletic Club and Erith Town F.C. (&apos;The Dockers&apos;), who play in the Kent League. (Note Erith &amp; Belvedere F.C. play in Welling.) Erith Rugby Club play at Northumberland Heath Recreation Ground. In 2007, the Tour de France passed through Erith during the London leg of the Tour. The Erith Playhouse Theatre is the largest in Bexley. { http://www.playhouse.org.uk/news.htm } There was a museum but it has now closed. { http://www.erithmuseum.org.uk/ } A new library with meeting room opened in Spring 2009 opposite the Health Centre. The Erith Symphony Orchestra ceased to exist in 1972 and it was almost 30 years before another orchestra was heard in the town, when the Dartford-based, Orchestra of the Thames Gateway gave a concert there in 2004 and in subsequent years. Erith is home to the longest pier in London, on the River Thames. It has been recently adapted from commercial to leisure use, and is popular with anglers. The annual Erith Riverside Festival has been held for a number of years in Riverside Gardens alongside the Thames. Erith Rowing Club is a successful and friendly club located in former police premises on the waterfront, accessed from Erith High Street. Downstream, Erith Yacht Club is very active in both competitive and social sailing, based on the edge of Crayford Marshes with consent for a new clubhouse. Erith is the starting point for the LOOP ( London Outer Orbital Path ) and one of the starting points for the Green Chain Walk. { http://www.greenchain.com/ } The Thames Path National Trail { http://www.ramblers.org.uk/info/paths/thames.html } which runs to the source of the River Thames at Kemble begins at nearby Crayford Ness. The initial broadcasts of pirate radio station West and North Kent Radio (WNKR) took place at Norvic House, Larner Road, Erith, during the bank holiday weekend in August 1987, on a frequency of 91.8FM. The station now transmits pre-recorded music shows on the medium wave (198 metres/1512  kHz) at weekends, with some Internet streaming options offered since 2000. [ People ] [ July 2011 ] A traditional (anonymous) rhyme has it that: &quot; There are men in the village of Erith that nobody seeth or heareth, and there looms on the marge of the river a barge, that nobody roweth or steereth &quot;.
