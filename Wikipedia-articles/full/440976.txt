These insignia are nearly identical to those of the British Army : see British Army officer rank insignia for details. In the guard regiments, Warrant Officers are known as Colour Sergeants and second lieutenants are known as Ensigns. LCdr (medical)&apos;s sleeve variant Except for those who acquired the Canadian Forces Mess Dress after 1968, naval officers have always worn the Royal Navy -style executive curl rank insignia on mess uniforms (see Royal Navy officer rank insignia ). The colour designations for specialist officers are not used except for naval medical officers who may use a variant of the standard rank slip-ons and shoulder boards incorporating a scarlet red background between the gold stripes of their rank and naval medical service officers (Nursing Officers, Pharmacy Officers, Health Care Administration Officers, Social Work Officers, Physiotherapy Officers, and Bioscience Officers) who have shoulder boards incorporating a dull cherry red background between the strips of their rank. [ The Royal Canadian Navy and the executive curl ] When the Canadian Navy was established in 1910 it was natural to adopt the same straight rings with the executive curl for the permanent navy that was designated as the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in August 1911 and subsequently the “wavy” shaped rings for the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) and the rings of narrow interwoven gold lace for the Royal Canadian Navy Reserve (RCNR). Other variations in rank insignia included sky blue lace with a diamond shaped loop for officers of the Women&apos;s Royal Canadian Naval Service and warranted Sea Cadet Corps Officers who had a small anchor in place of the executive curl. Following the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy was reorganized with a single reserve component. In 1946 the distinctive wavy gold braid of the reserves gave way to the straight braided executive curl of the regular force until 1968. With the integration of the Canadian Forces the sea element was designated as Canadian Forces Maritime Command. Unembellished straight braid became the common rank insignia for officers of both the Regular and Reserve Forces. The executive curl rank insignia has been in continuous use in the Canadian Navy, but from 1968 to 2010 it appeared only on navy mess dress. On 5 March 2010, the Canadian House of Commons passed a motion (moved by Guy Lauzon [ http://openparliament.ca/hansards/2171/184/only/ Guy Lauzon on Canadian Navy 5 March 2010 Hansard 10 January 2011 ] ) recommending the executive curl be reinstated on the Canadian navy uniform. Subsequently, in recognition of the Canadian Naval Centennial, Peter MacKay, Minister of National Defence, authorized the use of the executive curl for the Canadian Navy on 2 May 2010. The insignia became effective on 11 June 2010, on the occasion of the Pacific Canadian Naval International Fleet Review parade of nations in Victoria, B.C. { Marotte. B. (May. 03, 2010). &quot; Navy celebrates centennial by restoring historic insignia. &quot; The Globe and Mail. Retrieved on: 20 June 2010. } { National Defence Canada. Photo of the day archive. Retrieved on: 20 June 2010. } More than 54 countries including Canada and 18 other of the 22 Commonwealth navies use the insignia. Most navies that do not use the executive curl insignia substitute a star or other national device above the top row of lace such as the United States Navy and the French Navy.
