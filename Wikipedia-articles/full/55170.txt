[ full genome sequencing Talk:Genomics#Merger and splitting proposal January 2012 ] [ the scientific field the journal Genomics (journal) ] Genomics is a discipline in genetics concerned with the study of the genomes of organisms. The field includes efforts to determine the entire DNA sequence of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping. The field also includes studies of intragenomic phenomena such as heterosis, epistasis, pleiotropy and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome. In contrast, the investigation of the roles and functions of single genes is a primary focus of molecular biology or genetics and is a common topic of modern medical and biological research. Research of single genes does not fall into the definition of genomics unless the aim of this genetic, pathway, and functional information analysis is to elucidate its effect on, place in, and response to the entire genome&apos;s networks. [ National Human Genome Research Institute FAQ About Genetic and Genomic Science Genome.gov 2011-12-03 2010-11-08 http://www.genome.gov/19016904 ] For the United States Environmental Protection Agency, &quot; the term &quot; genomics &quot; encompasses a broader scope of scientific inquiry associated technologies than when genomics was initially considered. A genome is the sum total of all an individual organism&apos;s genes. Thus, genomics is the study of all the genes of a cell, or tissue, at the DNA (genotype), mRNA (transcriptome), or protein (proteome) levels. &quot; { EPA Interim Genomics Policy } [ History ] The first genomes to be sequenced were those of a virus and a mitochondrion, and were done by Fred Sanger. His group established techniques of sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatic analyses in the 1970-1980s. A major branch of genomics is still concerned with sequencing the genomes of various organisms, but the knowledge of full genomes has created the possibility for the field of functional genomics, mainly concerned with patterns of gene expression during various conditions. The most important tools here are microarray s and bioinformatics. Study of the full set of proteins in a cell type or tissue, and the changes during various conditions, is called proteomics. A related concept is materiomics, which is defined as the study of the material properties of biological materials (e.g. hierarchical protein structures and materials, mineralized biological tissues, etc.) and their effect on the macroscopic function and failure in their biological context, linking processes, structure and properties at multiple scales through a materials science approach. The actual term &apos;genomics&apos; is thought to have been coined by Dr. Tom Roderick, a geneticist at the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) over beer at a meeting held in Maryland on the mapping of the human genome in 1986.The Genomic Science Program (formerly Genomes to Life) uses microbial and plants. In 1972, Walter Fiers and his team at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the University of Ghent ( Ghent, Belgium ) were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. [ Min Jou W, Haegeman G, Ysebaert M, Fiers W Nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein Nature 237 5350 82–88 1972 4555447 10.1038/237082a0 ] In 1976, the team determined the complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA. [ Fiers W, Contreras R, Duerinck F, Haegeman G, Iserentant D, Merregaert J, Min Jou W, Molemans F, Raeymaekers A, Van den Berghe A, Volckaert G, Ysebaert M Complete nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage MS2 RNA: primary and secondary structure of the replicase gene Nature 260 5551 500–507 1976 1264203 10.1038/260500a0 1976Natur.260..500F ] The first DNA-based genome to be sequenced in its entirety was that of bacteriophage Φ-X174; (5,368 bp ), sequenced by Frederick Sanger in 1977. [ Sanger F, Air GM, Barrell BG, Brown NL, Coulson AR, Fiddes CA, Hutchison CA, Slocombe PM, Smith M Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage phi X174 DNA Nature 265 5596 687–695 1977 870828 10.1038/265687a0 ] The first free-living organism to be sequenced was that of Haemophilus influenzae (1.8 Mb ) in 1995 [ Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM, et al. Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd Science 269 5223 496–512 1995 7542800 10.1126/science.7542800 ], and since then genomes are being sequenced at a rapid pace. As of October 2011, the complete sequences are available for: 2719 virus es, [ Complete genomes: Viruses NCBI 2011-11-18 2011-11-17 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid%3D10239 ] 1115 archaea and bacteria, and 36 eukaryotes, of which about half are fungi. [ Genome Project Statistics Entrez Genome Project 2011-11-18 2011-10-07 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/static/gpstat.html ] Most of the bacteria whose genomes have been completely sequenced are problematic disease-causing agents, such as Haemophilus influenzae. [ 1465-6906 3 2 reviews0003.1-reviews0003.8 Hugenholtz Philip Exploring prokaryotic diversity in the genomic era Genome Biology 2002 ] Of the other sequenced species, most were chosen because they were well-studied model organisms or promised to become good models. Yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) has long been an important model organism for the eukaryotic cell, while the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been a very important tool (notably in early pre-molecular genetics ). The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is an often used simple model for multicellular organism s. The zebrafish Brachydanio rerio is used for many developmental studies on the molecular level and the flower Arabidopsis thaliana is a model organism for flowering plants. The Japanese pufferfish ( Takifugu rubripes ) and the spotted green pufferfish ( Tetraodon nigroviridis ) are interesting because of their small and compact genomes, containing very little non-coding DNA compared to most species. { BBC article &apos;&apos;Human gene number slashed&apos;&apos; from Wednesday, 20 October 2004 } { CBSE News, Thursday, 16 October 2003 } The mammals dog ( Canis familiaris ), [ National Human Genome Research Institute Dog Genome Assembled: Canine Genome Now Available to Research Community Worldwide Genome.gov 2004-07-14 http://www.genome.gov/12511476 2012-01-20 ] brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ), mouse ( Mus musculus ), and chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) are all important model animals in medical research. [ Major research areas ] [ Bacteriophage genomics ] Bacteriophage s have played and continue to play a key role in bacterial genetics and molecular biology. Historically, they were used to define gene structure and gene regulation. Also the first genome to be sequenced was a bacteriophage. However, bacteriophage research did not lead the genomics revolution, which is clearly dominated by bacterial genomics. Only very recently has the study of bacteriophage genomes become prominent, thereby enabling researchers to understand the mechanisms underlying phage evolution. Bacteriophage genome sequences can be obtained through direct sequencing of isolated bacteriophages, but can also be derived as part of microbial genomes. Analysis of bacterial genomes has shown that a substantial amount of microbial DNA consists of prophage sequences and prophage-like elements. A detailed database mining of these sequences offers insights into the role of prophages in shaping the bacterial genome. [ McGrath S and van Sinderen D Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology 1st Caister Academic Press 2007 http://www.horizonpress.com/phage 978-1-904455-14-1 ] [ Cyanobacteria genomics ] At present there are 24 cyanobacteria for which a total genome sequence is available. 15 of these cyanobacteria come from the marine environment. These are six Prochlorococcus strains, seven marine Synechococcus strains, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501. Several studies have demonstrated how these sequences could be used very successfully to infer important ecological and physiological characteristics of marine cyanobacteria. However, there are many more genome projects currently in progress, amongst those there are further Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus isolates, Acaryochloris and Prochloron, the N 2 -fixing filamentous cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena, Lyngbya aestuarii and Lyngbya majuscula, as well as bacteriophage s infecting marine cyanobaceria. Thus, the growing body of genome information can also be tapped in a more general way to address global problems by applying a comparative approach. Some new and exciting examples of progress in this field are the identification of genes for regulatory RNAs, insights into the evolutionary origin of photosynthesis, or estimation of the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the genomes that have been analyzed.

By 2007 the human sequence was declared &quot; finished &quot; (less than oneerror in 20,000 bases and all chromosomes assembled). [ Basic Books 978-0-465-04333-0 McElheny Victor Drawing the map of life : inside the Human Genome Project New York NY 2010 ] Display of the results of the projectrequired significant bioinformatics resources. The sequence of the human reference assembly can be explored using the UCSC Genome Browser or Ensembl. [ Metagenomics ] [ Metagenomics ] Metagenomics is the study of metagenomes, genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics, ecogenomics or community genomics. While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing rely upon cultivated clonal cultures, early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the 16S rRNA gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. Such work revealed that the vast majority of microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods.

Bacteriol 180 4765–74 9733676 18 107498 ] Recent studies use &quot; shotgun &quot; Sanger sequencing or massively parallel pyrosequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities.

[ Wang L Pharmacogenomics: a systems approach Wiley Interdiscip Rev Syst Biol Med 2 1 3–22 2010 20836007 10.1002/wsbm.42 ] By doing so, pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with respect to the patients&apos; genotype, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects.
