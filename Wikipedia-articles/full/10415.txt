[ Kimmei Emperor of Japan 539–571 Senka Bidatsu 509 571 (aged 61–62) Hinokuma no saki Ai no misasagi(Nara) ] [ Emperor Kimmei 欽明天皇 Kinmei- tennō 509–571 ] { Spelling note: A modified } { Hepburn romanization system for Japanese words is used throughout Western publications in a range of languages including } { English.

(1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 45. } His reign is said to have spanned the years from 539 through 571. { Brown, Delmer et al. (1979). Gukanshō, pp. 261-262; Varley, H. Paul. (1980).

(1834). } [ 18oNAAAAIAAJ Annales des empereurs du Japon,pp. 34-36. 34 ] [ Traditional narrative ] Kimmei&apos;s contemporary title would not have been tennō, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably Sumeramikoto or Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi (治天下大王), meaning &quot; the great king who rules all under heaven. &quot; Alternatively, Kimmei might have been referred to as (ヤマト大王/大君) or the &quot; Great King of Yamato. &quot; [ Events of Kimmei&apos;s life ] Because of several chronological discrepancies in the account of Emperor Kimmei in the Nihon Shoki, some believe that his was actually a rival court to that of Emperors Ankan and Senka. Nevertheless, according to the traditional account, it was not until the death of Emperor Kimmei&apos;s older brother Emperor Senka that he gained the throne. According to this account, Emperor Senka died in 539 at the age of 73; { Varley, p. 121. } and succession passed to the third son of Emperor Keitai. This Imperial Prince was the next youngest brother of Emperor Senka. He would come to be known as Emperor Kimmei. He established his court at Shikishima no Kanazashi Palace (磯城嶋金刺宮) in Yamato. The emperor&apos;s chief counselors were: Ōomi (Great Imperial chieftain): Soga no Iname no Sukune, also known as Soga no Iname. Ōmuraji (Great Deity chieftain): Monotobe Okoshi no Muraji, also known as Mononobe no Okoshi. Ōmuraji (Great Deity chieftain): Ōtomo Kanamura Maro, also known as Nakatomi no Kanamura. Although the imperial court was not moved to the Asuka region of Japan until 592, Emperor Kimmei&apos;s rule is considered by some to be the beginning of the Asuka period of Yamato Japan, particularly by those who associate the Asuka period primarily with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan from Korea. According to the Nihon Shoki, Emperor Kimmei received a bronze statue of Buddha as a gift from the king of Paekche King Song Myong (聖明王, Seimei Ō) along with a significant envoy of artisans, monks, and other artifacts in 552. (However, according to the Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu, Buddhism was introduced in 538.) This episode is widely regarded as the official introduction of Buddhism to the country. With the introduction of a new religion to the court, a deep rift developed between the Mononobe clan, who supported the worship of Japan&apos;s traditional deities, and the Soga clan, who supported the adoption of Buddhism. According to one famous episode, shortly after the Soga&apos;s began worshipping the new Buddha statue, a plague broke out, which the Mononobe&apos;s promptly attributed to a curse by Japan&apos;s traditional deities as punishment for worshipping the foreign god. Mononobe no Okoshi and his men promptly threw the statue into a river in Naniwa and burned the temple that the Soga&apos;s had built to hold it. According to the Nihon Shoki, Emperor Kimmei ruled until his death in 571 and was buried in the Hinokuma no Sakai Burial Mound (桧隈坂合陵). An alternate stronger theory holds that he was actually buried in the Misemaruyama Tumulus (見瀬丸山古墳) located in Kashihara City (橿原市). This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates the Nara location as Kimmei&apos;s mausoleum. It is formally named Hinokuma no saki Ai no misasagi; { Ponsonby-Fane, p. 419. } however, the actual sites of the graves of the early emperors remain problematic, according to some historians and archaeologists. [ Genealogy ] Emperor Kimmei&apos;s father was Emperor Keitai and his mother was Emperor Ninken &apos;s daughter, [ Princess Tashiraka 手白香皇女 Tashiraka Ōjo ]. { Brown, p. 262. } In his lifetime, he was known by the name [ Amekuni Oshiharaki Hironiwa 天国排開広庭 ].
