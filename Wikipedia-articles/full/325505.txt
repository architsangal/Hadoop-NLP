[ March 2012 ] The Dharmakāya ( Sanskrit : धर्म काय; Pali : धम्म कय, lit. &quot; truth body &quot; or &quot; reality body &quot; ) is one of the three bodies ( Trikaya ) of the Buddha in Mahayana Buddhism. Dharmakaya constitutes the unmanifested, &quot; inconceivable &quot; (Sanskrit: acintya) aspect of a Buddha, out of which Buddhas arise and to which they return after their dissolution. Buddhas are manifestations of the dharmakaya called nirmanakaya (Skt: Transformation body). One Buddhist scholar writes of it as: &apos;the body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is.&apos; { Dr. Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World, Shambhala, Boston, 2001, p. 13 } [ Etymology ] Tibetan: chos sku { Source: (accessed: January 15, 2008) } &quot; Chos &quot; (Tibetan) can be glossed as &quot; dharma &quot; (Sanskrit). &quot; Sku &quot; has the meanings: &quot; body, form, image, bodily form, figure &quot;. { Source: (accessed: January 15, 2008) } Thondup &amp; Talbott (1996, 2002: p.  48) render it as the &quot; ultimate body &quot;. { Thondup, Tulku &amp; Harold Talbott (Editor)(1996, 2002).

ISBN 978-0-14-045529-8. p.452 } [ Origins and development ] [ Pali Canon ] In the Pali Canon The Buddha tells Vasettha that the Tathagata (the Buddha) is Dhamma-kaya, the &quot; Truth-body &quot; or the &quot; Embodiment of Truth &quot;, as well as Dharmabhuta, &quot; Truth-become &quot;, that is, &quot; One who has become Truth &quot; (Digha Nikaya). [ Wikipedia:Citation needed#Citation needed citation needed noprint Template-Fact ] [ March 2012 ] During the Buddha&apos;s life great veneration was shown to him. A mythology developed concerning the physical characteristics of Universal Buddhas. After the Buddha&apos;s Parinirvana a distinction was made between the Buddhas physical body, rupakaya, and his Dharmakaya aspect. As the Buddha told Vakkali, he was a living example of the &apos;Truth&apos; of the Dharma. Without that form to relate to, the Buddha&apos;s followers could only relate to the Dharmakaya aspect of him. [ Trikaya doctrine ] [ Trikaya ] The Trikaya doctrine ( Sanskrit, literally &quot; three bodies &quot; or &quot; three personalities &quot; ) is a Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and the appearances of a Buddha. The Dharmakaya-doctrine was possibly first expounded in the Aṣṭasāhasrikā prajñā-pāramitā ( The Perfection of Insight In Eight Thousand Verses ), composed in the 1st century BCE. Around 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the Trikaya or three-body doctrine. According to this doctrine, Buddhahood has got three aspects: [ Snelling 1987 126 ] The Nirmana-kaya, or Transformation-body, The Sambhogakāya, or Enjoyment-body, The Dharmakāya, or Dharma-body. [ Qualities ] Tulku Thondup in &quot; Masters of Meditation and Miracles: Lives of the Great Buddhist Masters of India and Tibet &quot; states that Dharmakaya must possess three great qualities: Great purity (Wylie: sPang Pa Chen Po), Great realization (Wylie: rTogs Pa Chen Po), Great mind (Wylie: Sems Pa Chen Po).

Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala, South Asia Editions. ISBN 1-57062-113-6 (alk. paper); ISBN 1-56957-134-1. p.50 [ Immortality ] Unlike ordinary unenlightened persons, Buddhas (and arhats ) do not die (though their physical bodies undergo the cessation of biological functions and subsequent disintegration). [ April 2012 ] [ Interpretation in Buddhist traditions ] [ Theravada ] [ Dhammakaya Movement of Thailand ] Basing itself on the Pali suttas and meditative experience, the Dhammakaya Movement of Thailand (part of the Theravada School) teaches that the Dhammakaya (Dharmakaya) is the eternal Buddha within all beings. The dhammakaya (dharmakaya) is nirvana, and nirvana is equated to the true Self: &apos;The Buddha discovered that nirvana is atta [the Self]&apos;. { Paul Williams, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, Oxford, Second Edition, 2009, p. 126 } [ Mahayana ] [ Tathagatagarbha-tradition ] In the tathagatagarbha sutric tradition, the Dharmakaya is taught by the Buddha to constitute the transcendental, blissful, eternal, and pure Self of the Buddha. &quot; These terms are found in sutras such as the Lankavatara, Gandavyuha, Angulimaliya, Srimala, and the Mahaparinirvana, where they are used to describe the Buddha, the Truth Body (dharmakaya) and the Buddha-nature. &quot; { Mipam on Buddha-Nature: The Ground of the Nyingma Tradition by Douglas S. Duckworth, State University of New York Press, Albany, 2008, p. xiv } They are the &quot; transcendent results [of spiritual attainment] &quot;. [ Lotus Sutra ] In the Lotus Sutra (sixth fascicle) the Buddha explains that he has always and will always exist to lead beings to their salvation. [ Tibetan Buddhism ] Padmasambhava, Karma Lingpa, Gyurme Dorje, Graham Coleman and Thupten Jinpa (2005: p.  452) define &quot; Buddha-body of Reality &quot;, which is a rendering of the Tibetan chos-sku and the Sanskrit dharmakāya, as: [ [T]he ultimate nature or essence of the enlightened mind [byang-chub sems], which is uncreated (skye-med), free from the limits of conceptual elaboration (spros-pa&apos;i mtha&apos;-bral), empty of inherent existence (rang-bzhin-gyis stong-pa), naturally radiant, beyond duality and spacious like the sky. The intermediate state of the time of death (chi-kha&apos;i bar-do) is considered to be an optimum time for the realisation of the Buddha-body of Reality. For more discussion on this particular &apos;intermediate state of the time of death&apos; refer &quot; Chikkhai bardo &quot; (Tibetan) in the Bardo article. ] Reginald Ray, writing of the Vajrayana view of the Dharmakaya, defines it as: [ The body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is.&apos; Dr. Reginald Ray, Secret of the Vajra World, Shambhala, Boston, 2001, p. 13 ] [ Rime movement ] According to Jamgon Kongtrul, the founder of the Rime movement, in his 19th century commentary to the Lojong slogan, &quot; To see confusion as the four kayas, the sunyata protection is unsurpassable &quot; (as translated by Ken McLeod ) when one meditates on ultimate bodhicitta and rests in a state where appearances simply appear but there is no clinging to them, the dharmakaya aspect is that all appearances are empty in nature, the sambhogakaya is that they appear with clarity, the nirmanakaya is that this emptiness and clarity occur together, and the svabhavikakaya aspect is that these are inseparable. [ Gyaltrul Rinpoche&apos;s Dharmakaya Organization ] Recently, Dharmakaya has also become the name for an organization founded by H. E. the 4th Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche, and is affiliated with his global organization the United Trungram Buddhist Fellowship (UTBF). [ March 2012 ] Gyaltrul Rinpoche&apos;s Dharmakaya organization was founded for the specific purpose of bringing the teachings and meditation practices from the Trungram Tradition of the Karma Kagyu lineage to North America. [ March 2012 ] [ Iconography ] [ Emptiness ] In the early traditions of Buddhism, depictions of the Shakyamuni Buddha were neither iconic nor aniconic but depictions of empty space and absence: petrosomatoglyph s and footprints, for example. { Huntington, Susan (1990). &quot; Early Buddhist art and the theory of aniconism &quot; in Art Journal, Winter 1990. } This is a worthy visual device to draw attention to the &apos;absence&apos; and &apos;emptiness&apos; of &quot; thus gone &quot; (Sanskrit: Tathāgata ) and the doctrine of Śūnyatā and represent whilst not representing. Later representations of the buddha were introduced as &quot; skillful means &quot; (Sanskrit: upāya ). { For further discussion on this refer } { Buddhist art. } [ March 2012 ] [ Sky-blue ] Thondup &amp; Talbott identify Dharmakaya with the &quot; naked &quot; ( &quot; sky-clad &quot;; Sanskrit: Digāmbara ), unornamented, sky-blue Samantabhadra : [ lower-alpha For further discussion of &apos;Kāmamudrā&apos; (English: &apos;love-seal&apos;) refer: mudra, mahamudra and Yab-Yum. ] Fremantle states: [ Space is simultaneously the first and the last of the great elements. It is the origin and precondition of the other four, and it is also their culmination... The Sanskrit word for space is the same as for the sky: akasha, which means &quot; shining and clear. &quot; What is it that we call the sky? It marks the boundary of our vision, the limit our sight can reach. If we could see more clearly, the sky would extend infinitely into outer space. The sky is an imaginary boundary set by the limitations of our senses, and also by the limitations of our mind, since we find it almost impossible to imagine a totally limitless [U]niverse. Space is the dimension in which everything exists. It is all-encompassing, all-pervading, and boundless. It is synonymous with emptiness: that emptiness which is simultaneously fullness. Fremantle, Francesca (2001). Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Boston: Shambala Publications. ISBN 1-57062-450-X. p.85 ] The colour blue is an iconographic polysemic rendering of the Mahābhūta (Sanskrit) element, the &quot; pure light &quot; of &apos;space&apos; (Sanskrit: Ākāśa ). { Fremantle, Francesca (2001). Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Boston: Shambala Publications. ISBN 1-57062-450-X. p.86 } The conceptually bridging and building poetic device of analogy, as an exemplar where Dharmakaya is evocatively likened to &apos;sky&apos; and &apos;space&apos;, is a persistent and pervasive visual metaphor throughout the early Dzogchen and Nyingma literature and functions as a linkage and conduit between the &apos;conceptual&apos; and &apos;conceivable&apos; and the &apos; ineffable &apos; and &apos;inconceivable&apos; (Sanskrit: acintya ). It is particularly referred to by the Gongpa Zangtal [ lower-alpha Wylie: kun tu bzang po&apos;i dgongs pa zang thal du bstan pa; English: Direct Revelation of Samantabhadra&apos;s Mind ], a terma cycle revealed by Rigdzin Gödem (1337–1408) and part of the &apos;Northern Treasures&apos; or &apos;Jangter&apos; (chang ter; Wylie: byang gter). { Kunsang, Eric Pema (compiler, translator); Tweed, Michael (editor); Schmidt, Marcia Binder (editor); Zanpo, Ngawang (artwork) (2006).
