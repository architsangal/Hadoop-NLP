Martinez P-Nut Tim Mahoney Chad Sexton Jim Watson ] 311 (pronounced &quot; three-eleven &quot; ) is an American rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. The band was formed in 1988 by vocalist/guitarist Nick Hexum, lead guitarist Jim Watson (who would later be replaced by Tim Mahoney ), bassist Aaron &quot; P-Nut &quot; Wills and drummer Chad Sexton. In 1992, Doug &quot; SA &quot; Martinez joined to sing and provide turntables for 311&apos;s later albums, rounding out the current line-up. To date, 311 has released ten studio albums, one live album, four compilation albums, four EPs and four DVDs. After a series of independent releases, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records in 1992 and released the albums Music (1993) and Grassroots (1994) to moderate success. They achieved greater success with their 1995 triple platinum [ http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table%3DSEARCH_RESULTS%26amp%3Bartist%3D311%26amp%3Bformat%3DALBUM%26amp%3Bgo%3DSearch%26amp%3BperPage%3D50 RIAA certifications 2011-04-27 ] self-titled album, which reached #12 on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200 on the strength of the single s &quot; Down &quot; and &quot; All Mixed Up &quot;, the former of which topped the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 1996.

Their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits &apos;93–&apos;03 was also certified gold. The band&apos;s most recent studio album is 2011&apos;s Universal Pulse. As of 2011, 311 has sold over 8.5 million records in the U.S. [ http://www.redlightmanagement.com/artist.php?sect%3Dartist%26amp%3Bnum%3D192 Red Light Management redlightmanagement.com 2011-04-27 ] [ History ] [ Early recordings (1989–1992) ] 311&apos;s first independent release was the Downstairs EP, which was recorded in 1989 in Nick Hexum&apos;s basement. Unlike many of their releases, it had no cover art. [ http://musicmoz.org/Bands_and_Artists/3/311/Discography/Singles/Downstairs_EP/ MusicMoz – Bands and Artists: 3: 311: Discography Musicmoz.org 2011-10-26 ] A copy of this EP can easily be found circulating in bootleg circles and tape trading communities. In 1991, 311 released their second independent release, Unity, recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios, Omaha, which was released with far greater numbers than their first release Dammit!, which was also recorded in 1989 and released in the following year. While Dammit! only printed 300 cassettes, Unity had 1000 CDs and 500 cassettes printed and was distributed through consignment and also sold at shows. [ http://www.311.com/presspack2009 311 Press Pack 311.com 2011-09-11 ] The band began to headline shows in local clubs, such as The Ranch Bowl and Sokol Auditorium, and became a local success. In 1992, S.A. Martinez, who had been making various appearances with 311 over the past years as a vocalist, was officially asked to join the band. 311 recorded a six-track demo, called Hydroponic, and moved to Los Angeles. Within their first few months, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records. 311 considers their first show to be held on June 10, 1990, opening for Fugazi in Omaha, NE, at the Sokol Auditorium. [ Music and Grassroots (1993–1994) ] After taking their name from the police code for indecent exposure in Omaha NE (after the original guitarist for the band was arrested for streaking), their first major record, Music was released in 1993. The single &quot; Do You Right &quot; received airplay on modern rock stations and reached #27 on Billboard &apos;s Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, the album failed to chart at the time. Financing their own tour, the band drove around in an old RV borrowed from Chad&apos;s father, and towed a Volkswagen bus which held their equipment. After tackling a steep incline while en route to an Omaha show, the RV caught fire. The only door out of the vehicle was surrounded by flames so the band jumped through the fire. All of their equipment and possessions were lost, though no one was seriously injured. The band continued their tour, using borrowed equipment. The incident is referenced in various songs, including &quot; Omaha Stylee &quot;, with the lyrics: &apos;&apos;When one girl dreamt a fire in hers and then it happened &apos;&apos;To me and my family my bro&apos;s and I were driving &quot; The RV bleeding flames us leaping through fire surviving Zoned with no home there was fire all on it Umm let me have my life I want it The following year, they released their second studio album, Grassroots. Although none of the singles charted, the album reached #8 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and #193 on the Billboard 200, and tracks from Grassroots began popping up on college charts nationwide. It was during this time that 311&apos;s loyal fan base began to take on the form it remains in today. [ Mainstream breakthrough (1995–2001) ] In 1995, 311 released what was to be their biggest selling CD, the self-titled 311 (also known as The Blue Album). Produced by Ron St. Germain, the album was recorded live in contrast to their previous two albums in which all instruments were recorded separately. The first single &quot; Don&apos;t Stay Home &quot; was a modest success, reaching #29 on Billboard&apos;s Modern Rock Tracks chart. But the follow-up single &quot; Down &quot;, which was released 14 months after the album, received heavy airplay on mainstream radio and the accompanying music video was on MTV &apos;s rotation. The song hit #1 on the Modern Rock chart. The band made their network television debut on Late Night with Conan O&apos;Brien on August 23. The third single, &quot; All Mixed Up &quot;, enjoyed almost identical success, reaching #4 on the Modern Rock chart. These singles propelled the album to platinum status in 1996. The album eventually went triple-platinum. They also appeared on Late Show with David Letterman playing &quot; Down &quot;. In the following years, 311 continued touring and on August 5, 1997 they released Transistor which debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200, their highest position on that chart. While featuring popular tracks like &quot; Beautiful Disaster &quot;, &quot; Transistor &quot;, and &quot; Prisoner, &quot; the album also dealt with more weighty subject matter such as world affairs ( &quot; Borders &quot; ), spirituality ( &quot; Inner Light Spectrum &quot; ), and mysticism ( &quot; The Continuous Life &quot; ). Although not garnering as much fame as some of 311&apos;s previous output, the album quickly went platinum. In 1998, 311 released Live, a live album from a 1997 performance in New Orleans, Louisiana. 311 also released Omaha Sessions, a compilation album from their early independent releases. In 1999, 311 released their fifth major album, Soundsystem. &quot; Come Original &quot; was the album&apos;s first single and had success on radio and MTV. The song reached #6 on Billboard&apos;s Modern Rock Tracks chart. The video was heavily requested on MTV&apos;s TRL, and was #60 on TRL&apos;s Top 99 of &apos;99. The second single, &quot; Flowing &quot;, had American Pie&apos;s Eddie Kaye Thomas featured in the music video. The success of these albums helped the band&apos;s first two major albums, Music and Grassroots, reach certified gold status. In 1995, the band purchased a recording studio in North Hollywood, California called The Hive. The band has recorded every album at The Hive since 2000, beginning with the sessions for From Chaos, 311&apos;s sixth major record release. From Chaos was released in late 2001 and debuted at #10 on the Billboard 200. Its first single, &quot; You Wouldn&apos;t Believe &quot; featured basketball star Shaquille O&apos;Neal in the video and had a solid run of success on MTV. The album is also known for its third single, &quot; Amber &quot;, an ethereal love song with surf guitar and the group&apos;s signature reggae -flavored sound. [ &quot; 311 Day &quot; (First celebrated March 11th, 2000) ] [ 311_Day ] Starting in 2000 the band began celebrating their &quot; holiday &quot; of 311 Day, held on March 11 (3/11). Every other year the band and thousands of their most loyal fans gather to New Orleans and celebrate with an extended concert put on by 311. In 2000 they played 47 songs and in 2002 59 songs were played. In 2004 311 played 68 songs in 5 hours, and later that year a DVD was released of 311 Day 2004, containing 64 of the 68 songs. 311 Day in 2006 was held at the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee. The band played 65 songs, the setlist was cut short from 69, because of a strict curfew of midnight. The band recorded the entire show in high definition. A 2 hour edit of the show aired on HDTV on December 10. 311 Day in 2008 was held in the New Orleans Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana. They played 63 songs total, over three separated sets, to a sold out crowd of 14,000 fans, who represented all 50 states and 13 countries. In 2010, 311 Day took place at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. All 60 songs, 32 of which were different from 311 Day in 2008, [ http://setlist.com/311/311Day/2010.html 311 Day 2010 Setlist.com 2010-03-11 2011-10-26 ] were broadcast live on the web in a video on demand format described as a &quot; professional multi-camera HD production. &quot; [ September 2011 ] In 2012, 311 Day took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and, for the first time, was split into two days. The band performed 79 songs during the two-day concert. [ Evolver and Don&apos;t Tread on Me (2002–2006) ] Their seventh major release, Evolver (Produced By Ron Saint Germain), came in 2003 and marked a return to the straightforward guitar-heavy sound that the band had become known for. Evolver debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200, and the single &quot; Creatures (For A While) &quot; reached #3 on Billboard&apos;s Modern Rock Tracks chart. In 2004, 311 covered The Cure &apos;s &quot; Love Song &quot; which became a #1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also reached #59 on the Hot 100, their first single to reach that chart. It was featured on the soundtrack for the motion picture 50 First Dates and then a few months later on their own Greatest Hits &apos;93-&apos;03. The compilation debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold. The album also featured two new songs. &quot; How Do You Feel? &quot; and &quot; First Straw &quot;. Of these new tracks, &quot; First Straw &quot;, was released as a single and reached #14 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. On August 16, 2005, 311 released their eighth studio album, titled Don&apos;t Tread on Me. &quot; Don&apos;t Tread On Me &quot;, the first single, reached #2 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and #1 at R &amp; R. The next two singles, &quot; Speak Easy &quot; and &quot; Frolic Room &quot;, did not receive the same success as the first, neither of which made it past #20 on the Modern Rock Charts. On July 20, 2006, 311 kicked off their Summer Unity Tour, playing 37 shows in 27 states and featuring opening bands Pepper and the legendary Wailers. Though their album sales have declined in recent years, the band continued to attract record crowds to their shows. Over 18,500 people came to see the band in Atlanta, their largest audience ever in the city. Other cities with high turnouts included New Jersey (17,210 people), Boston (15,276), Washington DC (13,812), Omaha (13,467), Kansas City (11,156), and Colorado (10,000).
