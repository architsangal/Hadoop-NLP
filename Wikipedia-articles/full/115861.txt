The population was 4,866 at the 2000 census. Home to Range Ponds State Park, Poland is a historic resort area. It is included in both the Lewiston - Auburn, Maine metropolitan statistical area and the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. [ History ] It was granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1765 to officers and soldiers who served with Sir William Phipps in the 1690 Battle of Quebec. It replaced a 1736 grant made to them called Bakerstown (now Salisbury, New Hampshire ) which was ruled invalid in 1741 at the separation of New Hampshire from Massachusetts. The new plantation was also called Bakerstown (after Captain Thomas Baker), and included present-day Poland, Minot, Mechanic Falls and the greater part of Auburn. [ Coolidge Austin J. John B.

It was named after Indian Chief Poland, who was killed with two of his warriors on May 14, 1756 during the last Indian raid against New Marblehead Plantation (now Windham ). { Early History of Poland, Maine } At the beginning, Poland was an agricultural town, with [ 600 acre km2 ] of the best land farmed by the Shakers who settled at Poland Hill above the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in New Gloucester. Called the North Family of Shakers, the village was founded by members who removed from Gorham in 1819. It lasted until 1887. { The Sabbathday Lake Shakers and the Rickers of the Poland Spring Hotel } Industry was attracted to Poland&apos;s water power sites. In 1859, when the population was 2,660, it had 4 sawmill s, a gristmill, a tannery and a carriage factory. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad passed through the northeastern corner of the town, spurring development and bringing tourists drawn to its scenic ponds and gentle hills. By 1893, when Mechanic Falls was set off as a separate town, Poland had evolved into a Gilded Age resort. [ Varney George J. Gazetteer of the state of Maine. Poland Boston Russell 1886 http://history.rays-place.com/me/poland-me.htm ] In 1797, The Wentworth Ricker Inn in South Poland opened at the homestead Jabez Ricker acquired from a 1794 land swap with Alfred Shaker Village in Alfred. But when the railroad replaced stage travel, patronage declined and the inn closed. Then a grandson, Hiram Ricker, began proclaiming that the mineral spring on his family&apos;s property had cured his dyspepsia. People began arriving to sample the spring&apos;s curative waters, which flow 8 gallons a minute. Reopened in 1861, the inn was enlarged and renamed The Mansion House. But even that could not handle the crowds, so in 1875 the family built what was dubbed Ricker&apos;s Folly. { History of The Poland Spring House } On July 4, 1876, The Poland Spring House opened atop Ricker&apos;s Hill, an elevation of 800 feet (244 m) above sea level with magnificent views to the White Mountains. The hotel would be augmented over the years by architects John Calvin Stevens, Albert Winslow Cobb and Harry Wilkerson. It became a self-contained and exclusive spa, with guards at gatehouse s instructed to turn away sightseers. With luxurious accommodations for 450 guests, the hotel attracted the rich and famous. Patrons included Gen. Benjamin Butler, Sen. James G. Blaine, Joan Crawford, Jimmy Durante, Jack Paar and Robert Goulet. But following World War II, the era of grand hotels waned. When the Rickers sold The Poland Spring House, its new owners allowed the sprawling facilities to deteriorate. On July 3, 1975, the vacant hotel burned. Today, the famous water is bottled by Poland Spring. View of Poland, looking north, c. 1905 Home of Gov.

Poland was the site of one of the last major accidents involving aircraft from Maine&apos;s Cold War air bases. A United States Navy patrol bomber from Naval Air Station Brunswick Patrol Squadron 8 ( VP-8 ) disintegrated over Poland on 22 September 1978. An over-pressurized fuel tank caused the port wing of the Lockheed P-3 Orion to separate at the outboard engine. [ http://www.vpnavy.com/vp8_mishap.html VP-8 Mishap U.S.Navy Patrol Squadrons 2012-01-21 ] The detached wing sheared off part of the tail; and aerodynamic forces caused the remaining engines and starboard wing to detach from the fuselage. Debris rained down over a wide area near the Tripp Corner intersection on Route 11 shortly after noon. No homes were hit, but an explosive fuel-air fire following impact broke some windows. There were no survivors from the plane&apos;s 8-man crew.
