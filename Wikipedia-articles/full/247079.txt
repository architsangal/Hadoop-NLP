[ April 2011 ] [ Mars 300px Confection Mars, Incorporated 1932 ] Mars (also Mars bar) is a chocolate bar manufactured by Mars, Incorporated. It was first manufactured in Slough, Berkshire in the United Kingdom in 1932 as a sweeter version of the US Milky Way bar which Mars, Inc. produced (not to be confused with the European version of Milky Way, which is similar to the US 3 Musketeers ). It was advertised to the trade as being made with Cadbury&apos;s chocolate as &apos;couverture&apos;. In the United States, a different confection bears the Mars bar name. Featuring nougat, soft caramel, and almonds coated in milk chocolate, the American Mars bar was relaunched in 2010 after being discontinued in 2002.

[ UK Mars bar ] An open bar In 1932, Forrest Mars, son of American candy maker Frank C. Mars, rented a factory in Slough and with a staff of twelve people, began manufacturing a chocolate bar consisting of nougat and caramel covered in milk chocolate, modelled after his father&apos;s Milky Way bar, which was already popular in the US. [ http://www.marsbar.co.uk/history/ The history of Mars can be traced back to 1932 Mars www.marsbar.co.uk 23 June 2010 ] Today the basic recipe is unaltered but the size of the bar and the proportions of the main components have changed over the years. In 2002, the UK Mars bar was reformulated and repackaged. This made it sell for more money. { Guardian Unlimited, &quot; Mars bar &quot;, 18 March 2002, accessed 23 July 2006. } The nougat was made lighter, the chocolate on top became thinner, and the overall weight of the bar was reduced slightly. This was met with outrage from Mars purists, as in a sales pitch to local media in Slough, the change in ingredients was to follow the trend of its sister the Milky Way bar and 5 Star bars. Product designers at The Mars Candy Company in the US put this down to nostalgia over the past hugely popular Starbar, which also contained the same reinvented &apos;light whipped nougatine.&apos; The packaging was also redesigned with a less-bold and a more cursive logo. The slogan &quot; Pleasure you can&apos;t measure &quot;, was intended to appeal to a more feminine, youthful market. { https://www.just-food.com/article.aspx?id=72400 } Various sizes are made: miniature bars called &quot; Fun Size &quot; (19.7 g) and &quot; Snack Time &quot; (36.5 g) (both sold in multiple packs); a larger multi-pack size of 54 g; the regular sized single 58 g bar and a &quot; king-size &quot; 84 g bar which has since been replaced by &quot; Mars Duo &quot; (91 g) - a pack that contains 2 smaller bars instead of 1 large one. The regular 58 gram single bar contains 260 kilocalories. In the second half of 2008, Mars UK reduced the size of regular bars from 62.5 g to the current 58 g. Although the reduction in size was not publicised at the time, Mars claimed the change was designed to help tackle the obesity crisis in the UK. The company later confirmed that the real reason for the change was triggered by rising costs.

[ Canada ] A US Mars bar split Mars bars have been available in Canada for several decades, including numerous limited edition flavours. Because of Canada&apos;s higher chocolate standards, the Canadian &quot; Mars &quot; is not considered a &quot; chocolate bar &quot; and is labelled instead as a &quot; candy bar. &quot; In fact, unlike the American version, which labels the bar as &quot; milk chocolate, &quot; the Canadian version makes no mention of chocolate on the front of the wrapper. Since mid-2006, all Mars bars produced in Canada are peanut-free. Mars is one of the few candy bars in North America for which no size of the product has any trace of peanuts. In February 2008, Mars Canada introduced a new variety of Mars bar called &quot; Mars Caramel &quot; to compete with the Cadbury Caramilk and Nestle Aero Caramel bars.

The extortionist claimed to have poisoned seven Mars and Snickers bars at random stores in New South Wales. As a result Masterfoods Corporation, the company that manufactures Mars bars in Australia, recalled the entire Mars and Snickers product from store shelves in New South Wales. Nineteen people were possibly affected, with two being admitted to hospital. In the later half of August 2005, the threat to the public was deemed negligible and the bars returned to shelves.
