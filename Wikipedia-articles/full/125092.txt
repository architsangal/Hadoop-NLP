As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough population was 4,038. Oaklyn was incorporated as a borough by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 13, 1905, from portions of Haddon Township. { &quot; The Story of New Jersey&apos;s Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968 &quot;, John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 108. } [ Geography ] Oaklyn is located at [ 39.901291 -75.079827 type:city_region:US-NJ dms inline ] (39.901291,-75.079827). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.694 square miles (1.796 km 2 ), of which, 0.628 square miles (1.626 km 2 ) of it is land and 0.066 square miles (0.170 km 2 ) of it (9.48%) is water. [ 1 ] [ History ] Oaklyn was once dense forest land which was inhabited by Lenape Native Americans. In 1681, a group of Quakers seeking religious freedom sailed from Ireland to Fenwick&apos;s Colony at Salem, New Jersey where they spent the winter. { Clement, John (1877). Sketches of the first emigrant settlers of Newton Township. pp. 53-54 } In 1682, they sailed up the Delaware River and settled on Newton Creek. William Bates, their leader, purchased [ 250 acre km2 ] on the south side of Newton Creek from the local Native Americans. The original Quaker settlement, known as Newton Colony, was located in The Manor section of today&apos;s Oaklyn. { Tulini, Bob. &quot; Oaklyn: Small town reflects American image &quot;, } { Courier-Post, October 18, 2006. Accessed November 22, 2011. } The Colony began to grow rapidly and the land was cleared for farming. Eventually two highways were laid out. One, from the Delaware River to Egg Harbor, followed an old Native American trail, which is today the Black Horse Pike. The other was known as the Long-a-coming trail, which extended from Atlantic City to Berlin and then from Berlin to Camden. This trail is now known as the White Horse Pike. After the American Revolutionary War, a group of Virginia sportsmen built a racetrack on the east side of the White Horse Pike. President Ulysses S. Grant visited this track as a young man before it closed in 1846. Samuel Bettle bought the land which was formerly the racetrack and eventually, the land was deeded to Haddon Township. As the years passed, the farms along Newton Creek were divided into lots and the development called &quot; Oakland the Beautiful. &quot; The name was changed to Oaklyn in 1894 to avoid confusion with another Oakland in North Jersey. Finally, in 1905, Oaklyn broke away from Haddon Township and became an independent borough governed by a mayor and six councilmen. Oaklyn borders Audubon, Audubon Park, Collingswood, and Haddon Township.

Accessed January 23, 2012. } [ Emergency services ] The Oaklyn Fire Department (Station 18-3) is responsible for fire protection in the Borough of Oaklyn and until December 2007 was responsible for Haddon Township Fire District 3, which paid the Borough of Oaklyn for fire protection through tax money it collected from its residents. Fire District 3 covers the Bettlewood, Heather Glen, and Heather Woods sections of Haddon Township. This was a long standing agreement that existed since 1905. From 1902 when the Oaklyn fire service was established until 1905, Oaklyn and the Bettlewood section were both in Haddon Twp. Subsequently the Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 of the Oaklyn section of Haddon Township provided fire protection to the whole area, as it was and still is a continuous land mass. When Oaklyn seceded from the Township in 1905 there was an agreement made between Oaklyn Borough and Haddon Township that Oaklyn would still protect the District 3 section since they were much closer and the fire apparatus was horse drawn at the time. This relationship continued for another 102 years until January 2008. Currently, Fire District 3 is protected by Westmont Fire Co. # 1 pursuant to three consecutive one-year agreements. The Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 (Station 18-1) was established in 1902 (predating the borough&apos;s establishment) and was located on Newton Avenue near the Suburban Lumber Company, which ironically has been the site of several famous Camden County fires occurring in the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s. The Oaklyn Fire Co. building still stands today as a private residence. The company was formed by Oaklyn residents who had been volunteering their services at the nearby Defender Fire Company (Station 1-2), which was located in the community of Orston (then another section of Haddon Township, now part of Audubon borough ). Until the formation of the Oaklyn Fire Company, the Defender Fire Company handled firefighting duties in the Borough of Oaklyn (The Defender Fire Company was subsequently taken over by the Audubon Fire Department (Station 1-1) as of 1996). The Welcome Fire Company (Station 18-2) was established in 1906 and was located at the corner of the White Horse Pike and West Clinton Avenue. Today, the building houses the Oaklyn Police Department and Borough Hall and stands next to the current fire station. The Welcome Fire Company was established when residents who wished to volunteer with the Oaklyn Fire Company found they had filled their roster and were not &quot; welcoming &quot; any new members, hence their name. The current incarnation of the Oaklyn Fire Department was established in 1976 when Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 and the Welcome Fire Company consolidated their services. David Aron was the first Chief following the merger, previously serving as Chief of the Welcome Fire Company. The current Fire Chief is Mark Quinter.
