[ 1943 03 17 y ] { Annie Chidzira Muluzi } { Patricia Shanil Muluzi } { 7 } { Islam } { UDF } { http://www.bakilimuluzi.com } Elson Bakili Muluzi (born March 17, 1943) is a Malawi an politician. He was the President of Malawi from 1994 to 2004 and was Chairman of the United Democratic Front (UDF) until 2009. [ Presidency ] Muluzi was the candidate of the opposition UDF in the May 1994 presidential election, the country&apos;s first multiparty election. He won the election with 47% of the vote, defeating Malawi&apos;s leader since independence, Hastings Kamuzu Banda. He was re-elected in June 1999, taking 52.4% of the vote and defeating challenger Gwanda Chakuamba who was the leader of the opposition movement. { Elections in Malawi, African Elections Database. } In 2002 he proposed an amendment to Malawi&apos;s constitution that would have allowed him to run for a third term, but this was abandoned due to the move being blocked by the National Assembly of Malawi Members of Parliament, courts, and demonstrations against him. After serving two terms, he therefore handed over power to his successor after the May 2004 election, in which UDF candidate Bingu wa Mutharika (who was handpicked and groomed by Muluzi) was elected to succeed Muluzi as President. Muluzi came to lead the UDF after leaving the Banda government, and he became an advocate for democracy. Muluzi&apos;s time as President was marred by controversy and scandal, particularly due to the sale of Malawi&apos;s reserves of maize to other countries shortly before the onset of a drought, which resulted in famine throughout the country. Despite international pressure, the millions of dollars realized from the sale of Malawi&apos;s food reserves have never been turned over, and it is widely suspected that it wound up in foreign accounts belonging to Muluzi and his supporters. [ Post-presidency ] Even with the controversy and questionable dealings, Muluzi was a popular leader, particularly in southern part of the country. He remains the Chairman of the UDF, and after a dispute with his successor as President, Mutharika, the latter left the UDF and formed his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in February 2005. { &quot; Malawi president forms new party &quot;, BBC News, February 10, 2005. } In April 2005, Muluzi apologized to Malawians for choosing Mutharika as his successor &quot; and imposing him on the country &quot;. { &quot; Malawi president &apos;a bad choice&apos; &quot;, BBC News, April 5, 2005. } On July 27, 2006, Muluzi was arrested on fraud and corruption charges; { Raphael Tenthani, &quot; Former president held for corruption charges &quot;, Associated Press (IOL), July 27, 2006. } he was released on bail later that day. Hours after his arrest, the chief investigator Gustav Kaliwo was suspended by President Mutharika { &quot; Malawi anti-graft chief suspended &quot;, BBC News, July 28, 2006. } and Director of Public Prosecutions Ishmael Wadi said he had no choice but to drop the charges. Dr. Bakili Muluzi was once more arrested on 26 February 2009 and initially charged with 86 counts of corruption and abuse of office. He is being accused of allegedly diverting 1.7 billion Malawi Kwacha (US$11m) of donor money into his personal account. The said money, among others, came from the Republic of Taiwan, the Kingdom of Morocco and Libya. { &quot; Muluzi appears in court, seeks more time to take plea &quot;, Afrique en ligne. } [ 2009 presidential candidacy ] In early March 2007, with many prominent members of the UDF calling for Muluzi to run for president in 2009, the party said that he would have until March 11 to declare whether he intended to run. { Steven Pembamoyo Banda and Emmanuel Muwamba, &quot; UDF gives Muluzi 7 days to declare candidacy &quot;, The Nation (Malawi), March 5, 2007. } Accordingly, on that date Muluzi announced that he would seek the party&apos;s nomination as its presidential candidate. { Mabvuto Banda, &quot; Muluzi is prepared to run for office again &quot;, Reuters (IOL), March 12, 2007. } The question of whether Muluzi is eligible to run again has raised some controversy. Because the constitution refers to a limit of two consecutive terms, this could be regarded as enabling Muluzi to run again after being out of office for a term. { Anthony Kasunda, &quot; Lawyers divided over Muluzi&apos;s candidacy &quot;, The Nation (Malawi), March 11, 2007. } The Chairman of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), Alex Nampota, announced on March 17, 2008 that the ACB intended to prosecute Muluzi for allegedly diverting about 11 million dollars of donor money into his personal account; Nampota said that the ACB had asked the courts to lift an injunction that prevented it from questioning Muluzi. Kennedy Makwangwala, the Secretary-General of the UDF, denounced this as &quot; political persecution &quot;. { &quot; Malawi gunning for former president &quot;, Reuters (IOL), March 18, 2008. } On April 24, 2008, a UDF convention chose Muluzi as the party&apos;s 2009 presidential candidate. He received 1,950 votes against 38 for Vice-President Cassim Chilumpha. { &quot; Tough times ahead for Muluzi &quot;, Sapa-AFP (IOL), April 25, 2008. } On March 20, 2009 the Malawi Electoral Commission passed a judgement to bar Bakili Muluzi from running for the presidency for the third time. Muluzi challenged this, but on May 16, only three days before the election, the Constitutional Court ruled that Muluzi could not run again. { &quot; Malawi court dismiss ex-president&apos;s bid for office &quot;, AFP, 16 May 2009. } By that point, Muluzi and the UDF had thrown their support behind the candidacy of John Tembo, the President of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP). { &quot; Malawi court delays decision on ex-president&apos;s run &quot;, AFP, May 15, 2009. } Muluzi announced on December 23, 2009, that he was retiring from active politics and that Friday Jumbe was replacing him as UDF leader. { &quot; Muluzi retires from politics &quot;, Sapa-AFP (IOL), December 23, 2009. } [ 2008 arrest ] After Mutharika formed the DPP in 2005, over 70 Members of Parliament joined the DPP; the opposition, including the UDF, has sought to have these MPs expelled from their seats for switching parties. In May 2008, Mutharika said that Muluzi was trying to remove him from office by depriving the DPP MPs of their seats; to press its demand for the removal of the DPP MPs, the opposition had refused to debate any government bills. Mutharika called Muluzi a &quot; coward &quot; and accused him of treason. Speaking on Joy Radio, a station he owns, on May 12, 2008, Muluzi denied any plot against Mutharika and expressed exasperation with threats made by Mutharika. { &quot; Malawi police arrest ex-security, political chiefs over allegations of coup plot &quot;, Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), May 13, 2008. } Eight prominent associates of Muluzi were arrested shortly afterward in connection with the alleged plot to overthrow Mutharika; { &quot; Lawyer says former Malawi president arrested &quot;, Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), May 25, 2008. } an arrest warrant was also issued for Muluzi, who was in the United Kingdom at the time { Mabvuto Banda, &quot; Malawi coup plot: police grill Muluzi &quot;, Reuters (IOL), May 26, 2008. } on holiday. { &quot; Muluzi appears in court &quot;, Sapa-AFP (IOL), May 29, 2008. } In connection with the investigation into this alleged plot, police attempted to search Muluzi&apos;s home on May 14, but his guards barred them from entry. According to an aide to Muluzi, Humphrey Mvula, the police said that they wanted to remove guns from the home, but Mvula said that these guns had been issued by the police themselves for Muluzi&apos;s protection. On the same day, Muluzi said on Joy Radio that he would return to Malawi from the United Kingdom regardless of the alleged plot. { &quot; Malawi police investigating coup plot visit home of former president, turned away by guards &quot;, Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), May 15, 2008. } By May 25, all but one of the eight arrested associates of Muluzi had been released on bail. When Muluzi returned on May 25, 2008, he was arrested at the airport in Lilongwe. Muluzi had planned to address a UDF rally upon his arrival, and police surrounded the stadium where the rally was to be held. Thousands of infuriated supporters of Muluzi clashed with the police and blocked roads following his arrest. Muluzi was promptly flown to Blantyre, placed under house arrest { &quot; Police fail to formally charge Muluzi &quot;, Sapa-AFP (IOL), May 27, 2008. } at his home in Limbe, near Blantyre, and interrogated. His home was also searched by the police. Muluzi was questioned for about two hours and was shown documents which purportedly linked him to the alleged plot. Speaking on Joy Radio on May 27, Muluzi said that the documents were &quot; laughable and fake &quot; and accused the government of attempting to &quot; intimidate and silence the opposition &quot;. His lawyers said on the same day that they would seek bail for Muluzi. According to one lawyer, the only people allowed into Muluzi&apos;s home by the police were four lawyers and a bodyguard, and he had been asked to name family members and lawyers who would be given permission to visit. On May 29, Muluzi, who had still not been charged, appeared at the High Court in Blantyre for his bail application. On his arrival, he declared that the government was &quot; useless &quot;. Fahad Assani, the head of Muluzi&apos;s legal team, described the arrest as &quot; illegal and unconstitutional &quot; and demanded his release from house arrest. According to Assani, because more than 48 hours had passed and Muluzi had not been charged, it was necessary for him to be released &quot; without any conditions &quot;. Wezi Kayira, the Director of Public Prosecutions, urged the court to reject the bail application, stressing that treason was &quot; a very serious offence which carries a heavy penalty &quot;; he said that investigations were continuing and expressed concern that they &quot; would be jeopardised and evidence tampered with &quot;. Kayira also requested that the court impose &quot; very strict conditions &quot; if it chose to grant bail. Judge Joseph Manyumgwa granted Muluzi bail on May 30, saying that in the absence of any charges against Muluzi he had to be released. According to Manyumgwa, Muluzi had the right to bail regardless of &quot; the gravity of the alleged offence &quot;. Kayira said the investigation was ongoing and that charges would follow. { &quot; Muluzi granted bail &quot;, Sapa-Associated Press (IOL), May 30, 2008. } anamuwonongera tsongoro. [ Allegations of intimidation and 2009 legal charges ] Speaking to Capital Radio on 22 February 2009, Muluzi accused the government of using intimidation against his presidential candidacy and warned that such conduct could lead to &quot; problems &quot;. { &quot; Malawi&apos;s former president complains of &apos;intimidation&apos; &quot;, AFP, 22 February 2009. } A few days later, he was charged by the Anti-Corruption Bureau with stealing 12 million dollars of aid money; he appeared before a court in Blantyre and was released on bail. { &quot; Malawi ex-president charged with graft &quot;, AFP, 26 February 2009. } He appeared in court again on 12 March 2009 but failed to enter a plea on the 86 graft charges against him. Kalekeni Kaphale, a lawyer for Muluzi, asked for a delay, arguing that &quot; this is the first time someone has been charged with such a volume of cases &quot; in Malawi and that, since the defense had not seen the charges until early March, it needed &quot; at least 14 days to study them to make proper responses &quot;. { &quot; Muluzi seeks delay in graft case &quot;, Sapa-AFP (IOL), 13 March 2009. } [ Personal life ] Muluzi is Malawi&apos;s first Muslim President. He was married to two wives Annie Chidzira Muluzi and Patricia Shanil Muluzi while in office. He went through a divorce where he married Shanil Muluzi after divorcing Anne Muluzi. { http://www.zodiakmalawi.com/index.php?option=com_content &amp; view=article &amp; id=1633:40-minutes-with-atupele-muluzi &amp; catid=57:true-or-false } He has children, including Austin Atupele Muluzi. He is father-in-law to Angela Zachepa.
