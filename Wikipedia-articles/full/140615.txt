[ March 2012 ] The tropopause is the atmospheric boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. [ Definition ] Schematic showing the different layers of the atmosphere (not to scale). The tropopause locates between the troposphere and the stratosphere. The &apos;&apos;&apos;tropopause&apos;&apos;&apos; lies higher in the tropics than at the poles. Going upward from the surface, it is the point where air ceases to cool with height, and becomes almost completely dry. More formally, the tropopause is the region of the atmosphere where the environmental lapse rate changes from positive, as it behaves in the troposphere, to the stratospheric negative one. Following is the exact definition used by the World Meteorological Organization : [ International Meteorological Vocabulary 2nd 1992 Secretariat of the World Meteorological Organization Geneva 92-63-02182-1 636 ] The tropopause as defined above renders as a first-order discontinuity surface, that is, temperature as a function of height is continuous through the tropopause, but the temperature gradient is not.

The troposphere extends upwards from right above the boundary layer, and ranges in height from an average of [ 9 km mi ft on ] at the poles, to [ 17 km mi ft on ] at the Equator. { 2265 } { American Meteorological Society } [ Distribution and influence of convection in the tropical tropopause region Gettelman A. Salby M. L. Sassi F. 2002 Journal of Geophysical Research 107 American Geophysical Union 10.1029/2001JD001048 ] In the absence of inversion s and not considering moisture, the temperature lapse rate for this layer is 6.5°C per kilometer, on average, according to the U.S. Standard Atmosphere. [ Petty Grant W. A First Course in Atmospheric Thermodynamics 2008 Sundog Publishing Madison, WI 978-0-9729033-2-5 0972903321 ] [ 112 ] A measurement of both the tropospheric and the stratospheric lapse rates helps identifying the location of the tropopause, since temperature increases with height in the stratosphere, and hence the lapse rate becomes negative. The tropopause location coincides with the lowest point at which the lapse rate falls below a prescribed threshold. Since the tropopause responds to the average temperature of the entire layer that lies underneath it, it is at its peak levels over the Equator, and reaches minimum heights over the poles. On account of this, the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17  km over the equator. Due to the variation in starting height, the tropopause extremes are referred to as the equatorial tropopause and the polar tropopause. Given that the lapse rate is not a conservative quantity when the tropopause is considered for stratosphere-troposphere exchanges studies, there exists an alternative definition named dynamic tropopause. [ Andrews D. G. Holton J. R. C. B. Leovy Middle Atmosphere Dynamics Dmowska R. J. R. Holton 1987 Academic Press 0-12-058576-6 371 0120585766 ] It is formed with the aid of potential vorticity, which is defined as the product of the isentropic density, i.e. the density that arises from using potential temperature as the vertical coordinate, and the absolute vorticity, given that this quantity attains quite different values for the troposphere and the stratosphere. { 946 } Instead of using the vertical temperature gradient as the defining variable, the dynamic tropopause surface is expressed in potential vorticity unit s (PVU), with the tropopause layer typically lying within the 1.5–2 PVU surface in the Northern Hemisphere, although no universal values exist. Given that the absolute vorticity is positive (negative) in the Northern ( Southern ) hemisphere, the threshold value should be taken as positive (negative) north (south) of the equator. Theoretically, to define a global tropopause in this way, the two surfaces arising from the positive and negative thresholds need to be matched near the equator using another type of surface such as a constant potential temperature surface. Nevertheless, the dynamic tropopause is useless at equatorial latitudes because the isentropes are almost vertical. { WMO Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project Report No. 16 } { 1 } { 151 240 } { World Meteorological Organization } It is also possible to define the tropopause in terms of chemical composition. For example, the lower stratosphere has much higher ozone concentrations than the upper troposphere, but much lower water vapor concentrations, so appropriate cutoffs can be used. [ Phenomena ] The tropopause is not a &quot; hard &quot; boundary. Vigorous thunderstorm s, for example, particularly those of tropical origin, will overshoot into the lower stratosphere and undergo a brief (hour-order or less) low-frequency vertical oscillation. { 922 } { American Meteorological Society } Such oscillation sets up a low-frequency atmospheric gravity wave capable of affecting both atmospheric and oceanic currents in the region. [ March 2012 ] Most commercial aircraft are flown in the lower stratosphere, just above the tropopause, where clouds are usually absent, as also are significant weather perturbations.
