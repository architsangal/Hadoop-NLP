[ FootballFederationAustralia_logo.svg 1911 1963 AFC 2006 Frank Lowy Ben Buckley ] Football Federation Australia (FFA) is the governing body for the sport of football (soccer) in Australia. Before 1 January 2005, it was known as the Australian Soccer Association (ASA), which succeeded Soccer Australia in this role in 2003. Ben Buckley is currently the CEO of the FFA and Frank Lowy is the chairman. { Ben Buckley appointed as new FFA CEO Football Federation Australia 8 November 2006 } Among other duties, the FFA oversees Australia&apos;s national soccer teams (including the Socceroos (men), the Matildas (women), the Olyroos and other various youth teams); national coaching programmes; coordination with the various state and territory governing bodies; and the national club competition. Until 2004 the national competition was the National Soccer League; the FFA launched a new national league in 2005, the A-League. [ History ] [ A chequered past ] The FFA&apos;s origins lie as far back as 1911, with the formation of the Commonwealth Football Association. { - Brisbane Courier 16 April 1914 } This body was then superseded by the Australian Soccer Association, which was formed in 1921, with its headquarters in Sydney. However this association was suspended from FIFA in 1960 for the poaching of players from overseas. In 1961 the Australian Soccer Federation was formed. However, this association was refused re-admittance with FIFA until outstanding fines had been paid. In 1963 Australia was re-admitted to FIFA after the fines were reduced and paid. Australia first applied to join the Asian Football Confederation in 1964 but were denied, eventually forming the Oceania Football Federation with New Zealand in 1966. Football Federation Australia celebrated their 100th birthday on the 21 December 2011 { Celebrating history has net gains for FFA } [ Rebirth ] { 1995 –2003 } In 2003, following Australia&apos;s failure to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, unfounded allegations of fraud and mismanagement were levelled at Soccer Australia by elements within the Australian Press. Soccer Australia commissioned an independent inquiry known as the Crawford Report as a result of the Australian Government&apos;s threat to withdraw funding to the sport. The Australian Government could not interfere as any political interference would have constituted a breach of FIFA Statutes. The findings of the report were critically analysed by the board of Soccer Australia who believed that the recommendations contained therein [Crawford Report] were not capable of being implemented. This report recommended, among other things, the reconstitution of the body as the Australia Soccer Association (ASA) with an interim board headed by prominent businessman Frank Lowy. Some three months after Mr. Lowy&apos;s appointment Soccer Australia was placed into liquidation and ASA was created without encompassing the Crawford Report recommendations and effectively disenfranchising all parties who had an interest in Soccer Australia. The Australian Government provided approximately 15 million dollars to the ASA. The ASA renamed itself in 2005 to align with the general international usage of the word &quot; football &quot;, in preference to &quot; soccer &quot;, and to also distance itself from the failings of the old National Soccer League and Soccer Australia. It coined the phrase &quot; old soccer, new football &quot; to emphasise this. [ Move to AFC ] On 1 January 2006, the FFA moved from the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), of which it was a founding member, to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The move was unanimously endorsed by the AFC Executive Committee on 23 March 2005, and assented by the OFC in 17 April. The FIFA Executive Committee approved the move on 29 June, noting that &quot; as all of the parties involved... had agreed to the move, the case did not need to be discussed by the FIFA Congress &quot;, and was unanimously ratified by the AFC on 10 September.

The experience in being one of the first countries to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, after completing its qualifying rounds unbeaten and conceding only 1 goal, { http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/asia/standings/index.html } seems to confirm the wisdom of this initiative. The two main reasons for this move were: Improved competition: The strongest footballing nation in Oceania is now New Zealand, with the other teams involved being Papua New Guinea and tiny Pacific Island nations who do not pose any threat against teams of Australian professionals. This led to Australia holding the world record for most goals in a game in its 31-0 annihilation of American Samoa in 2001. http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2002/1271854.stm BBC News Many Asian nations such as Japan, Korea and some Middle Eastern clubs have a club competition equal or better in subjective quality than the Australian A-League, and have many other players in the top European leagues. http://www.iransportspress.com/?c=127 &amp; a=3205. Iran Sports Press Reduced travel time: Many of the top sides in the AFC are from the Middle East, which allows European based players a much shorter journey to away games in, say, Beirut or Riyadh than to those in Tahiti or Auckland. In February 2008, the FFA formally announced their intention to bid for the 2018 FIFA World Cup or 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

FFA failed in its bid for the 2022 World Cup having received only one vote from the FIFA Executive and spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in the process.
