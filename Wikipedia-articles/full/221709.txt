[ October 2011 ] [ Eirin 映倫 ] is the abbreviated name for [ Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai 映画倫理管理委員会 ], Japan &apos;s movie regulator. Eirin was established on the model of the American Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America &apos;s Production Code Administration in June, 1949, on the instructions of the US occupation force. The original name, Eiga Rinri Kitei Kanri Iinkai (Motion Picture Code of Ethics Committee), was condensed after independence, during reorganizations in 1956, to Eirin Kanri Iinkai, but was already colloquially known as Eirin. { Martin, Alex, &quot; EIRIN: All movies subject to rating, even cuts, Independent body screens, and censors, flicks &quot;, } { The Japan Times, March 2, 2010, p. 3. } Eirin is analogous to the Motion Picture Association of America in the United States, and the British Board of Film Classification in the United Kingdom; it classifies films depending on their suitability for minors, depending on whether they contain sexual or violent material. Such classification has been described as censorship by some [ October 2011 ], since a film that is denied certification by Eirin is effectively unreleaseable. In practice, films are nonetheless released, with &quot; offending items &quot; fogged or digitally tiled. This is the source of some bemusement in Japan, which has traditionally been liberal in this area. Just as with equivalent organisations in other countries, Eirin&apos;s defenders argue that its independence shields film makers from the more draconian alternative, political censorship by government. In the case of the controversial film Battle Royale, director Kinji Fukasaku seemed to accept this view, when he withdrew an objection to Eirin&apos;s R-15 rating of his film, to support Eirin against threats from politicians over the film. Eirin has in the past denied the release of certain films to theaters entirely, such as Kei Fujiwara &apos;s grotesque horror film Organ, which was released directly to video amidst protests from family watchdog groups. During the opening credits (or in some cases, on the copyright screen immediately following the ending credits) of an Eirin-approved film, the Eirin logo is displayed prominently underneath the movie&apos;s title.
