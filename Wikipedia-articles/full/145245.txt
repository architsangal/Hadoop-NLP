[ History ] Swarthmore College&apos;s outdoor amphitheater. The name &quot; Swarthmore &quot; has its roots in early Quaker history. In England, Swarthmoor Hall in Cumbria was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when George Fox, fresh from his epiphany atop Pendle Hill in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margaret Fell and the inhabitants of the nearby village of Fenmore of Friendly, and Swarthmoor was used for the first Friends&apos; meetings. The school was founded in 1864 by a committee of Quakers who were members of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, New York Yearly Meeting and Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. Edward Parrish was its first president. Lucretia Mott was among those who insisted that Swarthmore be coeducational. { Margaret Hope Bacon (1980), Valiant Friend: The Life of Lucretia Mott, page 199, ISBN 1-888305-09-6 } By the early 1900s, the college had a big-time sports program (playing Princeton, Columbia, and other larger schools) and an active fraternity and sorority life.

Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students. Students in seminars will usually write at least three ten-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20-30 page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their senior year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Around one student in each discipline is awarded &quot; Highest Honors &quot;; others are either awarded &quot; High Honors &quot; or &quot; Honors &quot;; rarely, a student is denied any Honors altogether by the outside examiner. Each department usually has a grade threshold for admittance to the Honors program.

Swarthmore&apos;s endowment at the end of FY2008 was $1,412,609,000. Endowment per student was $966,631 for 2007–2008, one of the highest in the country. Operating revenue for the 2007-2008 school year was $130,536,000, over 40% of which was provided by the endowment. As is the case with most elite institutions of higher education, actual costs as measured on a per-student basis far exceed revenue from tuition and fees, and so Swarthmore&apos;s endowment serves to offset ever-rising costs of education, subsidizing every student&apos;s education at Swarthmore—even those paying full tuition. For the 2008-2009 year, tuition, fees, and room &amp; board charges ($47,804) fell well short of the actual cost of education per student, which was approximately $81,073 in 2007-2008. Swarthmore ended a $230 million capital campaign on October 6, 2006, when President Bloom declared the project completed, three months ahead of schedule. The campaign, christened the &quot; Meaning of Swarthmore, &quot; had been underway officially since the fall of 2001. 87% of the college&apos;s alumni participated in the effort.

[ Clubs and organizations ] There are more than 100 chartered clubs and organizations at Swarthmore, in addition to many other unchartered groups. Clubs and organizations are a fundamental part of the College, and the center of many students&apos; energies and social life. This extracurricular involvement contributes to the frequent characterization of Swarthmore students as both motivated and overworked. [ Mock Trial ] Founded in 2007, the Swarthmore Mock Trial program has won numerous accolades and boasts a team of over 30 members for the 2011-2012 season. The 2010-2011 competitive season resulted in all three teams competing at Regional Championships, two teams going on to Opening Round Championships, and one team qualifying and competing at the 2011 National Championships held in Des Moines, Iowa, where the team placed 15th in their section.

[ Publications ] The official weekly newspaper of Swarthmore College is The Phoenix. It is published every Thursday, except during final week and vacation time. Some staff positions are paid a token amount. The newspaper was founded in 1881, with online editions beginning in 1995. Its current tabloid format is more similar to a newsmagazine than a newspaper, with a color front cover. Two thousand copies, free of charge, are distributed across the college campus and to the borough of Swarthmore. The newspaper is printed by Bartash printing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The newspaper&apos;s staff runs The Phoenix&apos;s website, with bandwidth provided by the Swarthmore College Information Technology Services. In 2010, The Phoenix was an Online Pacemaker for the Associated Collegiate Press award. The Daily Gazette is another student newspaper. E-mailed daily to 2,500 people, its coverage includes news, arts, and daily sports reporting. The first issues were distributed through e-mail during the fall semester of 1996, with an online edition soon following. It is partially funded through the Student Activity Fee, with additional income from advertising. There are a number of magazines at Swarthmore, most of which are published biannually at the end of each semester. One is Spike, Swarthmore&apos;s humor magazine. The others are literary magazines, including Small Craft Warnings, which publishes poetry, fiction and artwork; Scarlet Letters, which publishes women&apos;s literature; Enie, for Spanish literature; OURstory, for literature relating to diversity issues; Bug-Eyed Magazine, a very limited-run science fiction/fantasy magazine published by Psi Phi, formerly known as SWIL; Remappings (formerly &quot; CelebrASIAN &quot; ), published by the Swarthmore Asian Organization; Alchemy, a collection of academic writings published by the Swarthmore Writing Associates; Mjumbe, published by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society; and a magazine for French literature. An erotica magazine, ! (pronounced &quot; bang &quot; ) was briefly published in 2005 in homage to an earlier publication, Untouchables. Most of the literary magazines print approximately 500 copies, with around 100 pages. There is also a new photography magazine, Pun/ctum, which features work from students and alumni. The school&apos;s yearbook, The Halcyon, has been published annually since 1887. Because Commencement is such an important event, The Halcyon includes professional photos of the ceremony and is therefore printed later, in the fall. The new alumni, however, receive their book in the mail over the summer. The Halcyon is free to all students who attended Swarthmore for at least one semester during the academic year it covers. As a result, The Halcyon is the college&apos;s most costly student publication and there is currently a movement to offer books free only to seniors, and to reallocate money towards subsidizing student textbook costs. [ A Cappella ] Sixteen Feet, Swarthmore&apos;s oldest a cappella group, rehearses for a 30th Reunion Concert in October 2011. As of the 2009-2010 school year, there are five active a cappella groups. Sixteen Feet, founded in 1981, is the College&apos;s oldest group, as well as its first and only all-male group. Grapevine is its corresponding all-female group, and Mixed Company is a co-ed group. Essence of Soul is a group whose music focuses on the music of the African Diaspora. Lastly, Chaverim is a co-ed group that includes students from the Tri-College Consortium and draws on music from cultures around the world for its repertoire. Once every semester, all of the school&apos;s a cappella groups collaborate for a joint concert called Jamboree. [ Radio ] WSRN 91.5 FM is the college radio station. It has a mix of indie, rock, hip-hop, folk, world, jazz, and classical music, as well as a number of radio talk shows. At one time, WSRN had a significant news department, and covered events such as the &quot; Crisis of &apos;69 &quot;, { Crisis of &apos;69 } [ December 2010 ] extensively. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival. { Swarthmore Folk Festival } Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000 { Cuts to athletic programs } [ December 2010 ] and the effects of 11 September 2001 on campus. War News Radio and The Sudan Radio Project (formerly the Darfur Radio Project) do broadcast news on WSRN, however. Currently, the longest running show in WSRN&apos;s lineup is &quot; Oído al Tambor &quot;, which focuses on news and music from Latin America. The show has been running non-stop, on Sundays from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m., since September 2006. After its members graduated in December 2009, the show&apos;s concept was revived by the show &quot; Rayuela &quot;, which has been running since September 2009. [ Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association ] Swarthmore College students are eligible to participate in the local emergency department, the Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association. They are trained as firefighters and as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and are qualified on both the state and national level. The fire department responds to over 200 fire calls and almost 800 EMS calls a year. [ Activism and community service ] Swarthmore is known as a center of social and political activism. The Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility, endowed by philanthropist and Swarthmore alumnus Eugene M. Lang &apos;38 in 2002, prepares students for leadership in civic engagement, public service, advocacy and social action. Swarthmore students are active in the local community, performing outreach programs in nearby Chester. The college has recently received significant coverage due to two student groups founded in 2004, the Genocide Intervention Network (now an independent non-profit organization) and War News Radio. Swarthmore&apos;s political landscape is generally considered almost exclusively far-left, though student activism is far less than it was in the heyday of the protest culture of the 1960s. Recent high-profile campaigns included a living wage organization (Swarthmore Living Wage &amp; Democracy Campaign); actions surrounding the electronic voting machine manufacturer Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions ) by campus groups Students for Free Culture and Why War?; and a &quot; Kick Coke &quot; campaign aimed at replacing soda machines offering Coca-Cola with alternative products. The Kick-Coke campaign had a victory in November 2006 when the College agreed to cut its contract with Coca-Cola. However, after finding that the Kick-Coke campaign&apos;s assertions had been false, and after the company showed that it did indeed do a thorough investigation about the claims, Coca-Cola resigned a contract with the college in early fall of 2009.

[ Impact ] In September 2003, the SCCS servers survived a Slashdotting while hosting a copy of the Diebold memos on behalf of the student group Free Culture Swarthmore, then known as the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons. SCCS staff promptly complied with the relevant DMCA takedown request received by the college&apos;s ITS department.
