Part II is composed of 25 papers pertaining to the origin, administration and personalities of &quot; local universes, &quot; in particular the local universe of &quot; Nebadon &quot; that is said to contain Urantia. It presents narratives on the inhabitants of local universes and their work as it is coordinated with a scheme of spiritual ascension and progression of different orders of beings, including humans. Part III includes 48 papers that compile a broad history of the Earth, presenting a purported explanation of the origin, purpose, evolution, and destiny of our world and its inhabitants. An additional 15 papers cover various topics such as &quot; Religion in Human Experience &quot;, the concept of the Thought Adjuster, &quot; Personality Survival &quot;, and &quot; The Bestowals of Christ Michael &quot;. Part IV is presented in 77 papers and narrates &quot; The Life and Teachings of Jesus &quot;. Included are papers about his childhood, teenage years, family life, public ministry, and the events that led to his crucifixion, death, and resurrection. It continues with papers about appearances after he rose, Pentecost, and finally, &quot; The Faith of Jesus &quot;. Part IV illustrates many of the concepts presented in the first three parts through the story of Jesus&apos; life. [ Authorship ] { William S. Sadler } { Lena K. Sadler } The exact circumstances of the origin of The Urantia Book are unknown. The book and its publishers do not name a human author. Instead, it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an &quot; epochal &quot; religious revelation. For each paper, either a named celestial being, an order of being, or a group of beings is credited as its author. [ http://www.urantiabook.org/archive/history/histumov.htm Notes For A History of The Urantia Movement Urantiabook.org 2012-04-03 ] { &quot; How The Urantia Book Came Into Existence &quot; by William S. Sadler, Jr., February 18, 1962. } As early as 1911, William S. Sadler and his wife Lena Sadler, physicians in Chicago and well known in the community, are said to have been approached by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally. She reported that she was unable to wake him at these times. The Sadlers came to observe the episodes, and over time, the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from &quot; student visitor &quot; spiritual beings. This changed in early 1925 with a &quot; voluminous handwritten document &quot;, which from then on became the regular method of purported communication. The Sadlers were both respected physicians, and William Sadler was a debunker of paranormal claims, who is portrayed as not believing in the supernatural. In 1929, he published a book called The Mind at Mischief, in which he explained the fraudulent methods of mediums and how self-deception leads to psychic claims. He wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction. [ http://www.ubfellowship.org/archive/history/m_at_m.htm Appendix to The Mind at Mischief Ubfellowship.org 2012-04-03 ] [ The other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify, and which I would like very much to narrate more fully; I cannot do so here, however, because of a promise which I feel under obligation to keep sacredly. In other words, I have promised not to publish this case during the lifetime of the individual. I hope sometime to secure a modification of that promise and be able to report this case more fully because of its interesting features. I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance. While the sleep seems to be quite of a natural order, it is very profound, and so far we have never been able to awaken the subject when in this state; but the body is never rigid, and the heart action is never modified, though respiration is sometimes markedly interfered with. This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities. In fact, he is more or less indifferent to the whole proceeding, and shows a surprising lack of interest in these affairs as they occur from time to time. Eighteen years of study and careful investigation have failed to reveal the psychic origin of these messages. I find myself at the present time just where I was when I started. Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence. Its philosophic content is quite new, and we are unable to find where very much of it has ever found human expression. ] In 1924, a group of Sadler&apos;s friends, former patients, and colleagues began meeting for Sunday intellectual discussions, but became interested in the strange communications when Sadler mentioned the case and read samples at their request. Shortly afterwards, a communication reportedly was received that this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the &quot; contact personality &quot;. Sadler presented this development to the group, and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness, but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers. They became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions, until all papers now collected together as The Urantia Book were obtained. The group was known as the Forum. A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material. The Sadlers and others involved, now all deceased, claimed { Affidavit of Dr. Meredith Sprunger on October 24, 1998 regarding the origin of The Urantia Book } that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them, with the first three parts being completed in 1934 and the fourth in 1935. The last Forum gathering was in 1942. Also documented are methods of reception that Sadler denied as the way the papers were received. After the last of Part IV was obtained in 1935, an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions. Sadler and his son William (Bill) Sadler, Jr. at one point wrote a draft introduction and were told that they could not add their introduction because &quot; A city can not be lit by a candle. &quot; [ http://urantiabook.org/archive/history/h_timlin_3.htm Historic Timeline for the Urantia Book Readership Urantiabook.org 2012-04-03 ] [ http://www.freeurantia.org/Chapter6.htm Alternatively: &quot; A candle cannot light the way to the sun. &quot; Freeurantia.org 2012-04-03 ] The Foreword was then &quot; received. &quot; Bill Sadler is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book. [ Ernest P. Moyer The Birth of a Divine Revelation : The Origin of the Urantia Papers February 16, 2000 Moyer Pub 978-0-9678264-0-0 312 22 ] The communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the Forum studied the book in depth, and according to Sadler and others, permission to publish it was given to them in 1955. The Urantia Foundation was formed in 1950 as a tax-exempt educational society in Illinois, { Mather, George A. and Nichols, Larry A. (1993). Dictionary of Cults, Sects, Religions and the Occult. Zondervan Publishing House. ISBN 0-310-53100-4 } and through privately raised funds, the book was published under international copyright on October 12, 1955. Only the members of the Contact Commission witnessed the activities of the sleeping subject, and only they knew his identity. The individual is claimed to have been kept anonymous in order to prevent undesirable future veneration or reverence for him. Martin Gardner states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the Contact Commission, particularly William Sadler, was responsible. Gardner&apos;s conclusion is that a man named Wilfred Kellogg was the sleeping subject and authored the work from his subconscious mind, with William Sadler subsequently editing and authoring parts. A statistical analysis using the Mosteller and Wallace methods of stylometry indicates at least nine authors were involved, and by comparatively analyzing the book against Sadler&apos;s The Mind at Mischief, does not indicate authorship or extensive editing by Sadler, without ruling out the possibility of limited edits. [ Teachings ] [ Nature of God ] According to The Urantia Book, God is the creator and upholder of all reality—an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, infinite, and eternal spirit personality. The most fundamental teaching about God in the book is that he is a Father. &quot; The face which the Infinite turns toward all universe personalities is the face of a Father, the Universal Father of love. &quot; [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-105-deity-and-reality Paper 105, &quot; Deity and Reality &quot; Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] Even during the development of numerous other themes in The Urantia Book, God as a loving Father is emphasized as the central, unifying attitude of God toward the universe. [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-2-nature-god Paper 2, &quot; The Nature of God &quot; Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] God is said to be a mystery though because of the infinite scope of his perfection and his attributes. [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-1-universal-father Paper 1, &quot; The Universal Father &quot; Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] God, according to the book, is one Deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality, both personal and impersonal. God is taught to exist in a Trinity of three perfectly individualized persons who are co-equal: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. These persons are referred to by additional titles in the book, primarily as the &quot; Universal Father &quot;, &quot; Eternal Son &quot;, and &quot; Infinite Spirit &quot;. While stating that the concept of one God in three persons is difficult to fully understand, the book says that the idea &quot; in no manner violates the truth of the divine unity. The three personalities of Paradise Deity are, in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations, as one &quot;. The Father, Son, and Spirit are considered &quot; existential &quot; persons of Deity, those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future. In addition, three persons of Deity are described who are &quot; experiential &quot;, or incomplete and in the process of actualizing: God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and God the Absolute. Of these three, God the Supreme, or &quot; the Supreme Being &quot;, is given the most explanation, as the person of Deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite. The persons of God the Ultimate and God the Absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis. Many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book, and one of particular note is a joint &quot; offspring &quot; of the Universal Father and Eternal Son called a &quot; Creator Son &quot;. A divine Creator Son is considered the full representation of the Universal Father and Eternal Son that is possible to people. Jesus of Nazareth is identified as a Creator Son who incarnated on Earth and whose life and teachings are portrayed as the fullest revelation of the personality and attitude of God ever given to humanity. The final paper states: [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-196-faith-jesus Paper 196, &quot; The Faith of Jesus &quot; Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] [ To &quot; follow Jesus &quot; means to personally share his religious faith and to enter into the spirit of the Master&apos;s life of unselfish service for man. One of the most important things in human living is to find out what Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement of his exalted life purpose. Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it. ] [ God and the individual ] God is described as the Father of each individual, and through the direct gift of a fragment of his eternal spirit, called a Thought Adjuster, is said to be able to guide the individual toward an increased understanding of him. The Thought Adjuster is also called a &quot; Mystery Monitor, &quot; &quot; inner voice, &quot; &quot; divine spark, &quot; and &quot; pilot light &quot;. The concept is in ways comparable to the Hindu atman, the ancient Egyptian ka, and the Quaker inner light. In relation to biblical traditions, the Thought Adjuster is described by the book as the meaning behind the phrases &quot; being made in God&apos;s image &quot; and the &quot; kingdom of God is within you &quot; : [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-108-mission-and-ministry-thought-adjusters Paper 108, Mission and Ministry of Thought Adjusters Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] Each person is said to receive one such fragment at the time of his or her first independent moral decision, on average around the age of five years and ten months. The Adjuster then serves noncoercively as a divine partner in the mind of the individual for the rest of life, and to the extent that a person consents with their free will to want to find God, it leads the person toward more mature, spiritualized thinking. Through the practice of learning how to follow the inner leadings of the Adjuster—choose &quot; God&apos;s will &quot; —the individual progresses to greater God consciousness and spiritual growth. A person&apos;s Thought Adjuster is described as distinct from either the soul or the conscience. In The Urantia Book &apos; s teachings, the degree to which a human mind chooses to accept its Adjuster&apos;s guidance becomes the degree to which a person&apos;s soul &quot; grows &quot; and becomes a reality that can then survive death. The soul is in essence an embryonic spiritual development, one parental factor being the divine Adjuster and the other being the human will. The book many times links the biblical New Testament teachings of becoming like a little child in attitude of trust and sincerity as being the stance each person should have toward God. It says the attitude of open-minded teachability facilitates spiritual growth in liaison with the work of the Thought Adjuster and invariably leads a person to love and serve other people. It also says, &quot; But you yourself are mostly unconscious of this inner ministry. You are quite incapable of distinguishing the product of your own material intellect from that of the conjoint activities of your soul and the Adjuster &quot;. Persistently embracing sin is considered the same as rejecting the leadings of the Adjuster, rejecting the will of God. Constant selfishness and sinful choosing lead eventually to iniquity and full identification with unrighteousness, and since unrighteousness is unreal, it results in the eventual annihilation of the individual&apos;s identity. Personalities like this become &quot; as if they never were &quot;. The book says that &quot; in the last analysis, such sin-identified individuals have destroyed themselves by becoming wholly unreal through their embrace of iniquity &quot;. The concepts of Hell and reincarnation are not taught. From Paper 5, &quot; God&apos;s Relation to the Individual &quot; : [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-5-gods-relation-individual Paper 5 - God&apos;s Relation to the Individual &amp; #124; Urantia Book &amp; #124; Urantia Foundation Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] [ The great God makes direct contact with mortal man and gives a part of his infinite and eternal and incomprehensible self to live and dwell within him. God has embarked upon the eternal adventure with man. If you yield to the leadings of the spiritual forces in you and around you, you cannot fail to attain the high destiny established by a loving God as the universe goal of his ascendant creatures from the evolutionary worlds of space. ] The book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it, if the person chooses to accept the Adjuster&apos;s leadings and become self-identified with it. The act of fusion is the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life, described as typically taking place in the afterlife, but also a possibility during earthly life. The result during human life is a &quot; fusion flash &quot;, with the material body consumed in a fiery light and the soul &quot; translated &quot; to the afterlife. The Hebrew prophet Elijah being taken to heaven without death in &quot; chariots of fire &quot; is said to be a rare example in recorded history of a person who attained fusion. Once fused with his or her fragment of God, a person continues as an ascending citizen in the universe and travels through numerous worlds on a long, adventurous pilgrimage of growth and learning that eventually leads to God and residence on Paradise. Mortals who reach this stage are called &quot; finaliters. &quot; The book goes on to discuss the potential destinies of these &quot; glorified mortals &quot;. The Urantia Book places much emphasis on the idea that all individuals have the same opportunity to know God, and it says nothing can hinder a human being&apos;s spiritual progression if he or she is motivated to be spirit led. The book regards human life on earth as a &quot; short and intense test &quot;, and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life. The &quot; religion of Jesus &quot; is considered to be practiced by way of loving God the Father with a person&apos;s whole being, thereby learning to love each person the way Jesus loves people; that is, recognizing others as brothers and sisters and being of unselfish service to them. [ Cosmology ] The book teaches that the universe is the product of intelligent and purposeful organization. { Gardner, Martin (1995). Urantia: The Great Cult Mystery. Prometheus Books. ISBN 0-87975-955-0 } { Gooch, Brad (2002). Godtalk: Travels in Spiritual America. Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN 0-679-44709-1 } Information about cosmology and astronomy is provided in parts I, II, and III of the book. The book discusses space and time, describes the formation and evolution of galaxies, stars, and planets. The authors claim that the universe is teeming with intelligent life located mainly on the planets of extrasolar planetary systems. The book uses the term “universe” to denote a number of different scales of star groupings, possibly because the book was written at a time when galaxies outside of the Milky Way were still called “island universes.” “Master universe” refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe—all existing matter and space taken as a whole. The book uses “superuniverse” to describe an area comprising a single galaxy or contiguous group of galaxies which together constitute what the authors denote as the “grand universe.” A “local universe” is a superuniverse sub-unit made up of approximately 10 million inhabited worlds when fully developed. It is stated that our solar system is a small part of one of these “local universes.” Because the authors portray the universes as containing billions of inhabited planets, an extensive spiritual administration structure is presented. The book details the original structure of the universe with what is described as the stationary Isle of Paradise, the dwelling place of eternal God, at its center. Malcolm Locke writes: { &quot; The Structure and Meaning of the Universe Explained &quot;, Copyright 2010, Malcolm Locke, Bascom Hill Books, Minneapolis, Minnesota } “The eternal Paradise is the center of the universe and the dwelling place of the persons of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit and their coordinates and associates. Paradise is the geographic center of infinity. It is both material and spiritual and by far the largest organized body in the universe. All of the father’s intelligent creations dwell on material spheres, hence must the model for such spheres be partially material too. Paradise is the model for all the material creation.” Paradise is surrounded by Havona, a created universe containing a billion worlds. The seven groupings of galaxies surrounding Havona constitute the inhabited universe and have been designated in the book as the seven superuniverses. Four outer space levels of uninhabited universes exist beyond the periphery of the seven superuniverses. All the groupings of galaxies of inhabited and uninhabited universes circle around the Isle of Paradise, the gravitational center of the universe, which some Urantia Book readers identify as Great Attractor. [ TruthBook.com - Dr. Stefan H. Tallqvist - Great Attractor http://www.truthbook.com/index.cfm?linkID%3D98 ] The book discusses alternative explanations for the universe’s origin and offers explanations for some observed astronomical phenomena. For example, the book describes the concept of “space respiration” asserting that all of space undergoes “two-billion-year expansion-contraction cycles” and that these cycles provide an explanation for astronomic redshift. The Urantia Book says we are currently almost half way through an expansion cycle. { Urantia Foundation (1955). The Urantia Book. Urantia Foundation. ISBN 0-911560-02-5 } [ Science ] The book attempts to synchronize the religion, science and philosophy and many statements about science appear in the text. “The ideal human estate is that in which philosophy, religion, and science are welded into a meaningful unity..” &quot; Science teaches man to speak the new language of mathematics and trains his thoughts along lines of exacting precision. And science also stabilizes philosophy through the elimination of error, while it purifies religion by the destruction of superstition. &quot; The book hold science in high regard, however opposes the purely materialistic science. About conflict between science and religion the book states: “In reality, true religion cannot become involved in any controversy with science; it is in no way concerned with material things”.The Urantia Book debunks astrology as “pseudo science of Babylon” and also states: “But the frank, honest, and fearless search for true causes gave birth to modern science: It turned astrology into astronomy, alchemy into chemistry, and magic into medicine”. { Urantia Foundation (1955). The Urantia Book. Urantia Foundation. ISBN 0-911560-02-5 } In Paper 101, &quot; The Real Nature of Religion, &quot; [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-101-real-nature-religion Paper 101 - The Real Nature of Religion &amp; #124; Urantia Book &amp; #124; Urantia Foundation Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] the authors write: We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired. The only apparent anticipation of science the book has made, in Gardner&apos;s opinion, is that it says the magnetic sense that homing pigeon s possess is &quot; not wholly wanting as a conscious possession by mankind &quot;. In 1980, a British zoologist, Robin Baker, published evidence that humans have a limited magnetic sense. Kary Mullis a Nobel Prize winning American biochemist indicates on his website [ Kary Mullis website http://www.karymullis.com/urantia.html ] a striking coincidences between The Urantia Book (Copyright 1955) and the articles in “Science”: 309 (2005). According to The Urantia Book: “Adam and Eve arrived on Urantia, from the year A.D. 1934, 37,848 years ago”(Paper 74). The book calls them “biologic uplifters” and states: “The result of the gift of the Adamic life plasm to the mortal races is an immediate upstepping of intellectual capacity…”(Paper 52). { Urantia Foundation (1955). The Urantia Book. Urantia Foundation. ISBN 0-911560-02-5 } Article in “Science” tells: “The gene Microcephalin (MCPH1) regulates brain size and has evolved under strong positive selection in the human evolutionary lineage. We show that one genetic variant of Microcephalin in modern humans, which arose ~37,000 years ago, increased in frequency too rapidly to be compatible with neutral drift. This indicates that it has spread under strong positive selection, although the exact nature of the selection is unknown”. [ Science 9 September 2005 http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5741/1717.short ] Mark McMenamin, a professor of geology, quotes a section of the book describing a billion-year-old supercontinent that subsequently split apart, forming ocean basins where early marine life developed. He says, &quot; This amazing passage, written in the 1930s, anticipates scientific results that did not actually appear in the scientific literature until many decades later. &quot; McMenamin also states, &quot; Of course I am being selective here in my choice of quotations, and there are reams of scientifically untenable material in The Urantia Book. &quot; { McMenamin, Mark A.

The book&apos;s extensive teachings about the history of the world include its physical development about 4.5 billion years ago, the gradual changes in conditions that allowed life to develop, and long ages of organic evolution that started with microscopic marine life and led to plant and animal life in the oceans, later on land. The emergence of humans is presented as having occurred about a million years ago from a branch of superior primate s originating from a lemur ancestor. The Urantia Book says &quot; this story is graphically told within the fossil pages of the vast &apos;stone book&apos; of world record... the pages of this gigantic biogeologic record unfailingly tell the truth if you but acquire skill in their interpretation &quot;. Unlike current scientific views, evolution is said to be orderly and controlled. Primordial life is taught to have been intelligently planned, implanted, and monitored by &quot; Life Carriers &quot;, instead of arising spontaneously. The book says that &quot; mortal man is not an evolutionary accident &quot;, and that the purpose of evolution on a planet such as Urantia is to produce creatures of &quot; will dignity &quot; that can develop spiritual natures and survive material existence, going on to have eternal spiritual careers. The Urantia Book teaches not only biological evolution, but that human society and spiritual understandings evolve by slow progression, subject both to periods of rapid improvement and the possibility of retrogression. Progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers, which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of &quot; light and life &quot; in the far distant future. Though there is the ideal and divine plan, it is said to be fostered and administered by various orders of celestial beings who are not always perfect. Through mistakes or deliberate rebellion, the plan can be wrecked, requiring long spans of time to recoup lost progress. Urantia is said to be a markedly &quot; dark and confused &quot; planet that is &quot; greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment &quot; compared to more typical inhabited worlds, due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors. The Urantia Book describes the successive eras of biologic, intellectual, and spiritual uplifting as “epochal revelations” of God and his ministering agents to man. According to The Urantia Book the Lucifer Rebellion [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-53-lucifer-rebellion Paper 53 - The Lucifer Rebellion &amp; #124; Urantia Book &amp; #124; Urantia Foundation Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] was a disruption of God’s divine plan in the history of Urantia. In the book, Lucifer is classified as a “Primary Lanonandek Son” and head administrator of his attending system. He proposed the concepts of personal liberty, self-autonomy, and self-assertion. These concepts were adopted on Urantia first by the head of its human affairs, Caligastia. By joining Lucifer, Caligastia caused the eventual collapse of the same fragile civilization he had come to guide as “Planetary Prince” of the realm. [ Kelly Elstrott The Fifth Revelation: A collection of key passages from The Urantia Book 1998 Mighty Messenger Press Pub 0-9654301-7-0 55 ] The Urantia Book emphasizes that despite its dark history, Urantia has been the beneficiary of much good. The life of Jesus, designated in The Urantia Book as the “fourth epochal revelation,” is said to have redeemed the planet of the blunders of rebellion. “And when Jesus came down from his sojourn on Mount Hermon, the Lucifer rebellion in Satania and the Caligastia secession on Urantia were virtually settled.” [ God’s Bible: An Epochal Revelation Sponsored by God’s Angels, Part IV, Papers 120-196: The Life and Teachings of Jesus Pathways, Inc 90 ] [ The Life and Teachings of Jesus ] Part IV of the book presents epic story of Jesus life. From the birth in Bethlehem and infancy in Alexandria, the story goes through his hidden years of school in Nazareth, hard work as carpenter after death of Joseph to sustain the family of his widowed mother and eight brothers and sisters. The love of Rebecca, daughter of Ezra, and Jesus rejection of her proposal is narrated too. Then came the story of Jesus travel around the Mediterranean Basin (Alexandria, Rome, Athens etc ) and in the regions of Middle East (today Syria, Iraq, Iran). Next come the story parallel to this depicted in the New Testament, however bringing thousands of details not presented in Scripture. John the Baptist and the twelve Apostles are people of flesh and blood with their virtues and flaws. Genesis and performance of many Jesus miracles are depicted in detail. Jesus teaching, as presented to his apostles and followers, is exhaustive, enlarged and presented in contemporary language. The work of Women’s Evangelistic Corps appointed by Jesus is narrated too. Then follow the final days of Jesus sojourn on earth, the coming to Jerusalem, betrayal and arrest, unjust court, crucifixion, resurrection, appearances to apostles and believers, promise to return and ascension. Jesus mission on Earth the book describes as bestowal. The Michael is the cosmic name of Creator Son – Jesus. Each Creator Son, as there are many of such beings, can rule his part of universe – the local universe – after completing seven bestowals, the final of them is in the likeness of mortal flesh. This is the one of reasons why the Creator Son came to Earth – Urantia. The other purpose of his mission is stated in the book: “A Creator Son did not incarnate in the likeness of mortal flesh and bestow himself upon the humanity of Urantia to reconcile an angry God but rather to win all mankind to the recognition of the Father&apos;s love and to the realization of their sonship with God.” The core of Jesus teaching is that the men are children of God and their fellows are their brethren in one big family; when Jesus is their elder brother: “My Father sent me into the world to proclaim this salvation of sonship to all men”. The idea of kingdom of God as presented by Jesus was the rule of Heavenly Father in the hearts of men, but many of his followers misinterpret this idea as purely earthly kingdom. The book states that today Christianity is rather a religion about Jesus instead religion of Jesus – his original teaching – which the book reinstates. { Urantia Foundation (1955). The Urantia Book. Urantia Foundation. ISBN 0-911560-02-5 } [ Comparisons ] [ Comparison to Christianity ] Of all current major world religions, The Urantia Book &apos; s teachings are most similar to those of Christianity. However, there are numerous and significant differences between it and commonly accepted Christian beliefs. Jesus is held in high regard by The Urantia Book, as he is in the New Testament of the Bible. More than one third of the content of the book (Part IV) is devoted to a narrative about him. Part IV is said to be a restatement of his life and teachings based on a gathering of &quot; superior concepts &quot; from over two thousand individuals who have lived since his times, as well as from &quot; superhuman &quot; and &quot; superplanetary sources of information &quot;. The following are attributed to Jesus in the Urantia Book: He was both human and divine, one of many Creator Sons of God &quot; Creator Sons &quot; in the Urantian mythology are &quot; offspring &quot; of God the Father and the Eternal Son; more than 700,000 currently exist. who became incarnate. Jesus was born to Mary and Joseph by natural means. He lived a perfect life. He performed many of the miracles described in the Bible, such as the resurrection of Lazarus, the turning of water into wine, the feeding of the five thousand, and numerous healings of the blind, diseased, and infirm. He taught twelve apostles, most of whom went on to spread his teachings. He was crucified, and on the third day after his death, rose from the dead. He will return to the world again, many times. Some differences with Christianity include: { House, Dr. H. Wayne (2000). Charts of Cults, Sects, and Religious Movements. Zondervan. ISBN 0-310-38551-2 } Jesus&apos; crucifixion is not considered an atonement for the sins of humanity. The crucifixion is taught to be an outcome of the fears of religious leaders of the day, who regarded his teachings as a threat to their positions of authority. Jesus is the human incarnation of &quot; Michael of Nebadon &quot;, one of more than 700,000 &quot; Paradise Sons &quot; of God, or &quot; Creator Sons &quot;. Jesus is not considered the second person of the Trinity as he is in Christianity. The book refers to the Eternal Son as the second person of the Trinity. Jesus was born on earth through natural means of conception instead of a virgin birth. Jesus did not walk on water or perform some of the miracles that are attributed to him in the Bible. Jesus commissioned twelve women (and later more) as religious teachers, who traveled about with him and his apostles on their preaching missions. The book states that Jesus may return to the world many times. This contrasts with traditional Christian eschatology, in which Jesus returns only once. [ Comparison to Buddhism ] The Urantia Book considers Buddhism one of the &quot; great international, interracial faiths &quot; and says it &quot; has shown an adaptability to the mores of many peoples that has been equaled only by Christianity. &quot; Gautama Siddhartha is called a real prophet whose doctrines were &quot; revolutionary and amazing &quot; for their time. He is credited with being one of the seven outstanding teachers in human history in the matter of combining contemporaneous systems of ethical and religious teachings, a group that includes Moses, Laozi, and the Apostle Paul. The teaching that a divine nature—the Buddha-nature —resides in all people, and that through their own endeavors people can attain a realization of this inner divinity, is cited as one of the clearest presentations of the concept of the Thought Adjuster to be found in non-revelatory religion. The book says Gautama&apos;s experience was tragic, however, in that he was an &quot; orphan prophet &quot; whose philosophy failed early on to envision the reality of a spiritual God. Despite this, the book states: &quot; Buddhism is a living, growing religion today because it succeeds in conserving many of the highest moral values of its adherents. It promotes calmness and self-control, augments serenity and happiness, and does much to prevent sorrow and mourning. Those who believe this philosophy live better lives than many who do not. &quot; [ Comparison to other world religions ] Facets of other world religions are incorporated in the book, including from Islam, Taoism, Judaism, Hinduism, Shinto, and Confucianism. For example, Paper 131, &quot; The World&apos;s Religions &quot; [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-131-worlds-religions Paper 131 - The World&apos;s Religions &amp; #124; Urantia Book &amp; #124; Urantia Foundation Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] discusses in more depth those aspects of different religions that have commonalities with what the book claims is the &quot; religion of Jesus &quot;. There are also numerous other references to the world&apos;s major religions throughout Part III, &quot; The History of Urantia &quot;, beginning with Paper 86, &quot; Early Evolution of Religion &quot;. [ http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-86-early-evolution-religion Paper 86 - Early Evolution of Religion &amp; #124; Urantia Book &amp; #124; Urantia Foundation Urantia.org 2012-04-03 ] The perspective of The Urantia Book is that all religions should be studied to take &quot; the best &quot; from each. [ Consideration as literature ] [ August 2011 ] The Urantia Book has been enjoyed by some as a form of science fiction, historical fiction, or fantasy. The Urantia Book is noted for its high level of internal consistency and an advanced writing style. Parts I, II, and III are chiefly written in expository language. The papers are informational, matter-of-fact, and instructional. Part IV of the book is written as a biography of Jesus&apos; life, and some feel it is a rich narrative with well-developed characters, high attention to detail, woven sub-plots, and realistic dialogue. Considered as literature, Part IV is favorably compared to other retellings of Jesus&apos; life, such as The Gospel According to Jesus Christ by José Saramago and Behold the Man by Michael Moorcock. [ August 2011 ] Martin Gardner [ August 2011 ] considers Part IV to be an especially &quot; well-written, impressive work &quot;, and says, &quot; Either it is accurate in its history, coming directly from higher beings in position to know, or it is a work of fertile imagination by someone who knew the New Testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when Jesus lived. &quot; [ Critical views ] [ Criticisms of claims as a revelation ] In Paper 92, &quot; The Later Evolution of Religion &quot;, the authors refer to the papers as the fifth revelation of &quot; epochal significance &quot; to humankind, the fourth epochal revelation having been the life of Jesus. The claim of revelation in The Urantia Book has been criticized for various reasons. Skeptics such as Martin Gardner say it is a product of human efforts rather than a revelation because some of its science is flawed. Because the book does not support certain tenets of Christianity, such as for example the atonement doctrine, while at the same time presenting an account of parts of Jesus&apos; life absent in the Bible, others with a Christian viewpoint have argued it cannot be genuine. { Larson, Bob (2004). Larson&apos;s Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality. Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. ISBN 0-8423-6417-X } Other critics have felt that at over 2,000 pages, nearly twice the length of the King James Bible, it is too long, complex, and bureaucratic. { &quot; Clergy Evaluate The Urantia Book – I &quot; by Meredith Sprunger, January 1986. } [ Criticism of science ] Skeptics like Martin Gardner see the science in The Urantia Book as clear reflections of the views that prevailed at the time the book is said to have originated. The claim by the authors that no unknown scientific discoveries could be imparted is seen as a ruse to allow mistakes to be dismissed later. That presentation of post-1955 scientific knowledge is avoided is taken to be evidence it was written by humans and not by celestial beings with superior knowledge. Examples of criticisms regarding the science in The Urantia Book include: [ http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/CMplanhypoth.html Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis Daviddarling.info 2007-02-01 2012-04-03 ] [ http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/catashypoth.html catastrophic hypothesis Daviddarling.info 2007-02-01 2012-04-03 ] The described formation of the solar system is consistent with the Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis. Though popular in the early part of the 20th century, by the early 1940s it was discarded by Henry Russell &apos;s argument that it was incompatible with the angular momentum of planets such as Jupiter. The currently accepted scientific explanation for the origin of the solar system is based on the nebular hypothesis. The big bang theory is not supported. A fundamental particle called an &quot; ultimaton &quot; is proposed, with an electron being composed of 100 ultimatons. The particle is not known to be described anywhere else and the concept is not supported by modern particle physics. Some species are said to have evolved suddenly from single mutation s without transitional species. The theory originated with Dutch botanist Hugo De Vries, but was short-lived and is not now supported. The book says that a solar eclipse was predicted in 1808 by the Native American prophet Tenskwatawa. The eclipse was actually predicted in late April 1806 and occurred on June 16, 1806. Controversial statements about human races can be found in the book. Supporters state that criticism has arisen mainly due to reading passages out of context. Gardner believes that William S. Sadler, who wrote some eugenicist works, had a hand in editing or writing the book, and that this is how the ideas were included. While some adherents of the book believe that all of the information in The Urantia Book including its science is literally true, others accept the book&apos;s caveats and do not believe that the science is fully accurate. Meredith Sprunger, a liberal believer in The Urantia Book and retired minister in the United Church of Christ, writes, &quot; research has revealed that virtually all of the scientific material found in The Urantia Book was the accepted scientific knowledge of the period in which the book was written, was held by some scientists of that time, or was about to be discovered or recognized. &quot; He argues against its literal infallibility and that fundamentalism over the book is &quot; just as untenable as Biblical fundamentalism &quot;. Other believers maintain that the book has prophetically anticipated scientific advances already. They believe more of its science — if not all of it — will be proven correct in the future. Gardner evaluated many of these claims as of 1995 and found them unconvincing. Some arise because the book is said to have been indited by the revelators by 1935, but then was not published until 1955. Science discovered during the two intervening decades can be perceived as prophetic by believers, while skeptics think such facts were added prior to publication. For instance, the catalytic role that carbon plays in the sun&apos;s nuclear reactions is described in the book, though Hans Bethe &apos;s announcement of the discovery was not made until 1938. Most criticism of The Urantia Book is based on Martin Gardner&apos;s book, Urantia: The Great Cult Mystery. However this book has also been severely criticized. Sandra Collins, SLIS, Univ. of Pittsburg, wrote in Library Journal: &quot; Given the lack of scholary distance from the subject, the patronizing tone and the gross editorializing, it would be difficult to recommend this book to any library &quot;. { &quot; Gardner Book Review &quot; in the Library Journal, April 15, 1995 Book Reviews } Sarah Lewis, of the Univ. of Wales, stated: “Martin Gardner is one of the few people outside the Urantia Foundation who has undertaken research into the movement. His research is worth noting, although his position as a great skeptic does not allow his conclusions much academic credibility”. [ The Urantia Book and the use of published material ] The Urantia Book states in its Foreword that more than one thousand &quot; human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings &quot; were selected in preparing the papers. The authors say that they were required to &quot; give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented &quot; and would &quot; resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind. &quot; One of the authors wrote in Part IV: &quot; I well know that those concepts which have had origin in the human mind will prove more acceptable and helpful to all other human minds &quot;. In recent years, students of the papers have found that the free use of other sources appears to be true. None of the material allegedly used from other sources is directly cited or referenced within the book. In 1992, a reader of The Urantia Book, Matthew Block, self-published a paper that showed nineteen possible examples of The Urantia Book utilizing material published earlier. { &quot; Some Human Sources of The Urantia Book &quot; by Matthew Block, originally published in 1992. Describes suspected parallels Block found between The Urantia Book and possible human sources of material. } All of the source authors identified in Block&apos;s paper were published in English between 1905 and 1943 by U.S. publishers and are typically scholarly or academic works that contain concepts and wording similar to what is found in The Urantia Book. Block has since claimed to have discovered over 125 source books and articles, written by over 90 authors, which were incorporated into the papers. The use of outside source materials was studied separately by Gardner and Gooch, and they concluded that the book did use many of the sources noted by Block. For instance, Gardner and Block note that Paper 85 appears to have been taken from the first eight chapters of Origin and Evolution of Religion by Edward Washburn Hopkins, published by Yale University Press in 1923. Each section of the paper corresponds to a chapter in the book, with several passages possibly used as direct material. Likewise, much of The Urantia Book material relating to the evolution of mankind appears to have been directly taken from Henry Fairfield Osborn, Man Rises to Parnassus: Critical Epochs in the Prehistory of Man published by Princeton University Press in 1928. Block and many believers do not see the use of human source materials as inappropriate. Block writes: [ One probable reason that the human sources were left undisguised was to enable students to discern, through comparative analysis, how this coordination of planetary knowledge was actually effected. As mentioned above, the initial analyses have already proved tremendously illuminating in this regard. Another reason was to keep us aware of the book’s anchorage in a specific time and place. While a very large part of the book is of timeless value and perennial applicability, some of its discussions directly address and respond to the world situation of the early 20th century. Thus, every generation will have to determine the relevance and applicability of certain of the book’s teachings to its own situation. Emerging from all these discoveries is the gratifying realization that the Urantia Book is exactly what its authors claim it to be. ] Also Meredith Sprunger wrote: [ http://urantiabook.org/archive/mjs_archive/mjs_purpose_of_revelation.htm Response to Martin Gardner&apos;s Urantia: The Great Cult Mystery Urantiabook.org 2012-04-03 ] { &quot; As we mentioned earlier, the authors of The Urantia Book clearly state that they have used human sources and why they are using them. The use of these human sources is often handled in such a way as to arrive at a position differing from that of the human author. To accuse the superhuman authors of plagiarism is a bit far fetched, as they are not concealing the use of human sources and they deliberately avoided reference to specific human personalities—they do not want any St. Peter or St. Paul connected with the Fifth Epochal Revelation. This, in my judgment, is certainly a wise decision &quot;. } David Elders noted in his article: [ http://urantiabook.org/archive/newsletters/herald/Herald-2010.pdf The Fellowship Herald, Vol. II, Summer 2010 Urantiabook.org 2012-05-02 ] The discovery of those human authors whose thinking and expression were used in The Urantia Book should not surprise us. Their existence was forthrightly disclosed by the revelators. In fact, more than one thousand human concepts, reflective of the highest human knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings, were selected for that purpose. Examination of the concepts expressed also tells us about ourselves—like the level of human reality realization at the time The Urantia Book was presented to human consciousness. Or such a study might enable us to distinguish between previously revealed truth and its amplification and correction in this epoch. Even more, comparative textual analysis could help us identify new truths not previously revealed. For example, the fact that personality is a bestowal of the Father himself must be revealed. Such truth is simply not discoverable by human mind. [ Adherents ] There is no way to gauge how many adherents there may be as there is no central organization to census. Informal study groups &quot; tend to sprout, ripen, then vanish or splinter &quot; and have not been counted reliably. Readers sometimes join study groups after reading on their own for years or decades, others join them soon after developing an interest in the book, while &quot; for most, worship remains as individual as the act of reading. &quot; Disagreements over the legal ownership of the book, its interpretation, and the reception of new revelations have led to some splintering, though these disagreements appear to have been settled to the satisfaction of most adherents. The movement generally incorporates a nonsectarian view, contending that individuals with different religious backgrounds can receive the book&apos;s teachings as an enrichment rather than as a contradiction of their faiths. { Melton, J. Gordon. 1990. New Age Encyclopedia (First Edition). Gale Research Inc. } The small movement inspired by The Urantia Book has not developed clergy or institutions such as churches, reading rooms, or temples. { Partridge, Christopher (2004). New Religions: A Guide (2nd Edition). Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-522042-0 } As of 2006, the Urantia Foundation had one office in Chicago and five people on staff. Sarah Lewis notes that, &quot; The Urantia Revelation is not securing legitimacy through historically known and accepted means to any great degree, nor is it even using common language that would increase the likelihood of understanding and therefore acceptance. It introduces new concepts and a new language, and this does not make acceptance any easier. &quot; She assesses that the movement is uncontroversial compared to other ones, &quot; lacking the zealous proselytizing found within many other groups &quot;, and that it is therefore likely to remain small and unaffected by opposing views. Urantia Foundation advocated a &quot; slow growth &quot; policy in the past and had not significantly marketed the book. Sales by Urantia Foundation went from 7,000 in 1990 to 24,700 in 1997, and steadily increased to nearly 38,000 in 2000, an &quot; upturn that seems to represent a genuine trend rather than just some spike on a sales chart &quot;, however in 2011 the Foundation reported worldwide annual sales of 16,000 copies and over 60,000 downloads from various sites. More than half of the books printed by Urantia Foundation are in languages other than English, particularly Spanish and Portuguese. [ From Urantia Foundation News Online March 2012 http://www.urantia.org/sites/default/files/docs/Foundation_2012_March_Newsletter.pdf ] Since the book was determined to be in the public domain in 2001, other organizations, such as The Urantia Book Fellowship under the publishing name Uversa Press, have also published the book. Copies of The Urantia Book are on the Internet in various formats and it has been adapted to more recent platforms such as the Kindle and the iPhone / iPod Touch App Store. Several audio books of the text are also on the Internet. The International Urantia Association had twenty-six reader associations worldwide as of 2002, and the Urantia Book Fellowship (formerly the Urantia Brotherhood, founded in 1955 with Urantia Foundation as the original social fraternal organization of believers) claimed roughly twelve hundred official members, with the highest concentrations in the West of the United States and the Sun Belt, especially California, Colorado, Florida, and Texas. It appears an increasing number of people are forming study groups, participating in Internet discussion groups, and hosting or visiting websites about it. Reader conferences take place around the world. { Urantia Book related Calendar of Events } [ April 2012 ] [ Symbols ] Paradise Trinity One symbol described in The Urantia Book consists of three concentric azure circles on a white background. The circles are said to have symbolized several trinity associations in the history of humankind. The authors of The Urantia Book indicate its revealed meaning as being &quot; the infinity, eternity, and universality of the Paradise Trinity of divine maintenance and direction. &quot; Urantia logo Urantia Foundation, the original publisher, placed the concentric circles on the cover of The Urantia Book and has a United States trademark.
