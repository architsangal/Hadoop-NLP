[ Cadwallader ] Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon ( [ Cadwaladr son of Cadwallon ], also Cadwallader or Cadwalader) was King of Gwynedd (reigned c. 655 – 682). Two devastating plagues happened during his reign, one in 664 and the other in 682, with himself a victim of the second one. Little else is known of his reign. Cadwaladr is most widely recognised as a prominent character in the romantic stories of Geoffrey of Monmouth, where he is portrayed as the last in a line of legendary kings of Britain. Y Ddraig Goch ( [ The Red Dragon ] ) has long been known as a Welsh symbol, appearing in the Mabinogion, the Historia Brittonum, and the stories of Geoffrey of Monmouth. It has commonly been referred to as &apos;The Red Dragon of Cadwaladr&apos;, and since the accession of Henry VII to the English throne, it has often been referred to as &apos;The Red Dragon of Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon&apos;. The association with Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon is a traditional one, without a firm historical provenance. Cadwaladr&apos;s name appears without the identifying patronymic &apos;ap Cadwallon&apos; in a number of historical and literary works, such as in the Armes Prydein. Without additional corroborating information it cannot be assumed that Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon is the person referred to, rather than a different person with the same name. [ Historical record ] { cantref i &apos;&apos;. } Cadwaladr&apos;s name appears in passing in serious historical works, such as those by Davies [ Davies 1990 63 ] {, A History of Wales } and Lloyd, [ Lloyd 1911 230 ] {, A History of Wales, Vol I } and then only to mention that he was the son of a famous father, Cadwallon ap Cadfan, and the successor to King Cadafael. His name appears in the pedigrees of the Jesus College MS. 20 [ Phillimore 1887 87 ] { — he is in his descendant&apos;s pedigree, given as:... Cynan tintaeth6y. M. Rodri mol6yna6c. M. Idwal I6rch. M.

Cadwaladr&apos;s name appears as &apos;Catgualart&apos; in a section of the Historia Brittonum, where it says he died of a dreadful mortality while he was king. [ 1841 Giles J. A. (translator) III.

Idwal, who fathered the later king Rhodri Molwynog, may have been his successor. [ Geoffrey of Monmouth ] The name of the historical Cadwalladr ap Cadwallon figures prominently in Geoffrey of Monmouth &apos;s romantic account of the Historia Regum Britanniae ( [ History of the Kings of Britain ] ). As such, the Cadwaladr of Geoffrey is a literary invention that used the name of a historical person in order to advance the plot of the story. In Book XII, Chapter XIV of the Historia, Cadwaladr is given as the last in a line of kings that began with Brutus of Troy. Chapters XV – XVIII have him leaving a depopulated Britain for Brittany, then traveling to Rome, where he dies after meeting the pope. [ 1842 Giles J. A. Thompson A. The British History of Geoffrey of Monmouth: In Twelve Books New James Bohn 1842 London http://books.google.com/?id%3DFUoMAAAAIAAJ%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dtitlepage ] Also traced to Geoffrey&apos;s fertile imagination are stories of Ivor ap Alan and Ynyr traveling from Brittany to Britain. [ Stephens Thomas Thomas Stephens (historian) 12 November 1857 The Book of Aberpergwm, Improperly Called the Chronicle of Caradoc http://books.google.com/books?id%3DjZkVAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA77 Archaeologia Cambrensis IV Third Cambrian Archaeological Association 1858 London 81 –82 ] The choice of names for Ivor and Ynyr in the stories may be a consequence of spurious additions to the Laws of Edward the Confessor, which inaccurately speak of good relations between Wessex and the Welsh in the reign of King Ine of Wessex (reigned 688 – 726). From there emerges a conflation of Cadwaladr or Cadwallon with Cædwalla of Wessex (reigned 685 – 688), and a conflation of Cadwaladr&apos;s son Ivor with Cædwalla&apos;s son Ine.
