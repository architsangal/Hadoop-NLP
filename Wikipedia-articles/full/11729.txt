The actual fuel cell stack is the layered cube shape in the center of the image Scheme of a proton conducting fuel cell A fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. [ Khurmi R.S Material Science http://www.biblio.com/books/436308472.html ] Hydrogen is the most common fuel, but hydrocarbons such as natural gas and alcohols like methanol are sometimes used. Fuel cells are different from batteries in that they require a constant source of fuel and oxygen to run, but they can produce electricity continually for as long as these inputs are supplied. Welsh Physicist William Grove developed the first crude fuel cells in 1839. The first commercial use of fuel cells was in NASA space programs to generate power for probes, satellites and space capsules. Since then, fuel cells have been used in many other applications. Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial, industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas. They are used to power fuel cell vehicle s, including automobiles, buses, forklifts, airplanes, boats, motorcycles and submarines. There are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of an anode (negative side), a cathode (positive side) and an electrolyte that allows charges to move between the two sides of the fuel cell. Electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing direct current electricity. As the main difference among fuel cell types is the electrolyte, fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use. Fuel cells come in a variety of sizes. Individual fuel cells produce very small amounts of electricity, about 0.7 volts, so cells are &quot; stacked &quot;, or placed in series or parallel circuits, to increase the voltage and current output to meet an application’s power generation requirements. { Nice, Karim and Strickland,Jonathan. &quot; How Fuel Cells Work: Polymer Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells &quot;. How Stuff Works, accessed August 4, 2011 } In addition to electricity, fuel cells produce water, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions. The energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40-60%, or up to 85% efficient if waste heat is captured for use. [ History ] [ Timeline of hydrogen technologies ] Sketch of William Grove&apos;s 1839 fuel cell The principle of the fuel cell was discovered by German scientist Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1838 and published in one of the scientific magazines of the time. [ Fuel Cells History, part 1 George Wand Johnson Matthey plc http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/pdf/archive/Article_1104_Fuel%20Cell%20History%20Part%201.pdf PDF 14 2008-10-06 In January 1839 the German/Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein wrote an article in one of the scientific magazines of the time about his discovery of ozone and about the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. But it was no other than William Grove to document just one month later, in February of 1839, his observations in the &quot; Philosophical Magazine &quot;. He had conducted a series of experiments with his second invention which he termed a “gas voltaic battery”. ] Based on this work, the first fuel cell was demonstrated by Welsh scientist and barrister Sir William Robert Grove in the February 1839 edition of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science { Grove, William Robert &quot; On Voltaic Series and the Combination of Gases by Platinum &quot;, Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science vol. XIV (1839), pp 127-130. } and later sketched, in 1842, in the same journal. { Grove, William Robert &quot; On a Gaseous Voltaic Battery &quot;, Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science vol. XXI (1842), pp 417-420. } The fuel cell he made used similar materials to today&apos;s phosphoric-acid fuel cell. In 1955, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist working for the General Electric Company ( GE ), further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Three years later another GE chemist, Leonard Niedrach, devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane, which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. This became known as the &apos;Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell&apos;. [ December 2011 ] GE went on to develop this technology with NASA and McDonnell Aircraft, leading to its use during Project Gemini. This was the first commercial use of a fuel cell. In 1959, British engineer Francis Thomas Bacon successfully developed a 5  kW stationary fuel cell. In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15  kW fuel cell tractor for Allis-Chalmers which was demonstrated across the US at state fairs. This system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and compressed hydrogen and oxygen as the reactants. Later in 1959, Bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine. In the 1960s, Pratt and Whitney licensed Bacon&apos;s U.S. patents for use in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks). In 1991, the first hydrogen fuel cell automobile was developed by Roger Billings. [ Roger Billings Biography International Association for Hydrogen Energy http://www.iahe.org/advisory.asp?did%3D2 2011-03-08 ] United Technologies Corporation &apos;s UTC Power subsidiary was the first company to manufacture and commercialize a large, stationary fuel cell system for use as a co-generation power plant in hospitals, universities and large office buildings. UTC Power marketed their fuel cell, the PureCell 200, a 200  kW system, now replaced by a 400  kW version, the PureCell Model 400. [ The PureCell Model 400 - Product Overview UTC Power http://www.utcpower.com/products/purecell400 2011-12-22 ] UTC Power continues to be the sole supplier of fuel cells to NASA for use in space vehicles, having supplied fuel cells for the Apollo mission s, [ http://www.spaceaholic.com/apollo_artifacts.htm Apollo Space Program Hydrogen Fuel Cells Spaceaholic.com 2009-09-21 ] and the Space Shuttle program, and is developing fuel cells for automobiles, buses, and cell phone towers. The company has demonstrated the first fuel cell capable of starting under freezing conditions with its proton exchange membrane. [ Types of fuel cells; design ] Fuel cells come in many varieties; however, they all work in the same general manner. They are made up of three adjacent segments: the anode, the electrolyte, and the cathode. Two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments. The net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed, water or carbon dioxide is created, and an electric current is created, which can be used to power electrical devices, normally referred to as the load. At the anode a catalyst oxidizes the fuel, usually hydrogen, turning the fuel into a positively charged ion and a negatively charged electron. The electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it, but the electrons cannot. The freed electrons travel through a wire creating the electric current. The ions travel through the electrolyte to the cathode. Once reaching the cathode, the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical, usually oxygen, to create water or carbon dioxide. A block diagram of a fuel cell The most important design features in a fuel cell are [ December 2011 ] : The electrolyte substance. The electrolyte substance usually defines the type of fuel cell. The fuel that is used. The most common fuel is hydrogen. The anode catalyst, which breaks down the fuel into electrons and ions. The anode catalyst is usually made up of very fine platinum powder. The cathode catalyst, which turns the ions into the waste chemicals like water or carbon dioxide. The cathode catalyst is often made up of nickel but it can also be a nanomaterial-based catalyst. A typical fuel cell produces a voltage from 0.6 V to 0.7 V at full rated load. Voltage decreases as current increases, due to several factors: [ Larminie James Fuel Cell Systems Explained, Second Edition SAE International 1 May 2003 0-7680-1259-7 ] Activation loss Ohmic loss ( voltage drop due to resistance of the cell components and interconnects) Mass transport loss (depletion of reactants at catalyst sites under high loads, causing rapid loss of voltage). To deliver the desired amount of energy, the fuel cells can be combined in series and parallel circuits, where series yields higher voltage, and parallel allows a higher current to be supplied. Such a design is called a fuel cell stack. The cell surface area can be increased, to allow stronger current from each cell. [ Proton exchange membrane fuel cells ] In the archetypical hydrogen –oxygen proton exchange membrane fuel cell { Anne-Claire Dupuis, Progress in Materials Science, Volume 56, Issue 3, March 2011, Pages 289-327 } (PEMFC) design, a proton-conducting polymer membrane, (the electrolyte ), separates the anode and cathode sides. This was called a &quot; solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell &quot; (SPEFC) in the early 1970s, before the proton exchange mechanism was well-understood. (Notice that the synonyms &quot; polymer electrolyte membrane &quot; and &quot; proton exchange mechanism &quot; result in the same acronym.) On the anode side, hydrogen diffuses to the anode catalyst where it later dissociates into protons and electrons. These protons often react with oxidants causing them to become what is commonly referred to as multi-facilitated proton membranes. The protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode, but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit (supplying power) because the membrane is electrically insulating. On the cathode catalyst, oxygen molecule s react with the electrons (which have traveled through the external circuit) and protons to form water — in this example, the only waste product, either liquid or vapor. In addition to this pure hydrogen type, there are hydrocarbon fuels for fuel cells, including diesel, methanol (see: direct-methanol fuel cell s and indirect methanol fuel cell s ) and chemical hydrides. The waste products with these types of fuel are carbon dioxide and water. { PEMFC : Bipolar plate as } { electrode with in-milled gas channel structure, fabricated from conductive } { composite s (enhanced with } { graphite, } { carbon black, } { carbon fiber, and/or } { carbon nanotube s for more conductivity); Kakati, B.K., Deka, D., “Effect of resin matrix precursor on the properties of graphite composite bipolar plate for PEM fuel cell”, Energy &amp; Fuels 2007, 21 (3):1681–1687. } { Porous carbon papers; reactive layer, usually on the } { polymer membrane applied; polymer membrane. } [[Image:condensation.jpg|400px|thumb|Condensation of water produced by a PEMFC on the air channel wall.

The bipolar plates may be made of different types of materials, such as, metal, coated metal, graphite, flexible graphite, C –C composite, carbon – polymer composites etc. { Kakati B.K., Deka D., “Differences in physico-mechanical behaviors of resol and novolac type phenolic resin based composite bipolar plate for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell”, Electrochimica Acta 2007, 52 (25): 7330–7336. } The membrane electrode assembly (MEA), is referred as the heart of the PEMFC and usually made of a proton exchange membrane sandwiched between two catalyst coated carbon paper s. Platinum and/or similar type of noble metal s are usually used as the catalyst for PEMFC. The electrolyte could be a polymer membrane.

In 2009, the Department of Energy reported that 80-kW automotive fuel cell system costs in volume production (projected to 500,000 units per year) are per kilowatt. Fuel cell system cost The goal is per kilowatt. Cost reduction over a ramp-up period of about 20 years is needed in order for PEM fuel cells to compete with current market technologies, including gasoline internal combustion engines. Meyers, Jeremy P. &quot; Getting Back Into Gear: Fuel Cell Development After the Hype &quot;. The Electrochemical Society Interface, Winter 2008, pp. 36–39, accessed August 7, 2011 Many companies are working on techniques to reduce cost in a variety of ways including reducing the amount of platinum needed in each individual cell. Ballard Power Systems has experiments with a catalyst enhanced with carbon silk which allows a 30% reduction (1  mg/cm² to 0.7  mg/cm²) in platinum usage without reduction in performance. Monash University, Melbourne uses PEDOT as a cathode. A 2011 published study http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja1112904?journalCode=jacsat documented the first metal-free electrocatalyst using relatively inexpensive doped carbon nanotube s that are less than 1% the cost of platinum and are of equal or superior performance. Water and air management (in PEMFCs). In this type of fuel cell, the membrane must be hydrated, requiring water to be evaporated at precisely the same rate that it is produced. If water is evaporated too quickly, the membrane dries, resistance across it increases, and eventually it will crack, creating a gas &quot; short circuit &quot; where hydrogen and oxygen combine directly, generating heat that will damage the fuel cell. If the water is evaporated too slowly, the electrodes will flood, preventing the reactants from reaching the catalyst and stopping the reaction. Methods to manage water in cells are being developed like electroosmotic pump s focusing on flow control. Just as in a combustion engine, a steady ratio between the reactant and oxygen is necessary to keep the fuel cell operating efficiently. Temperature management. The same temperature must be maintained throughout the cell in order to prevent destruction of the cell through thermal loading. This is particularly challenging as the 2H 2 + O 2 - &gt; 2H 2 O reaction is highly exothermic, so a large quantity of heat is generated within the fuel cell. Durability, service life, and special requirements for some type of cells. Stationary fuel cell applications typically require more than 40,000 hours of reliable operation at a temperature of -35 °C to 40 °C (-31 °F to 104 °F), while automotive fuel cells require a 5,000 hour lifespan (the equivalent of ) under extreme temperatures. Current service life is 7,300 hours under cycling conditions. Automotive engines must also be able to start reliably at -30 °C (-22 °F) and have a high power to volume ratio (typically 2.5  kW per liter). Limited carbon monoxide tolerance of some (non-PEDOT) cathodes. [ High temperature fuel cells ] [ SOFC ] [ Solid oxide fuel cell ] Solid oxide fuel cell s use a solid material, most commonly a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), as the electrolyte. Because SOFCs are made entirely of solid materials, they are not limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes. They require high operating temperatures (800°C to 1000°C) and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas. { &quot; Types of Fuel Cells &quot;. Department of Energy EERE website, accessed August 4, 2011 } SOFCs are unique in that negatively charged oxygen ion s travel from the cathode (negative side of the fuel cell) to the anode (positive side of the fuel cell) instead of positively charged hydrogen ions travelling from the anode to the cathode, as is the case in all other types of fuel cells. Oxygen gas is fed through the cathode, where it reacts with electrons to create oxygen ions. The oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode. The reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products. Carbon dioxide may also be a by-product depending on the fuel, but the carbon emissions from an SOFC system are less than those from a fossil fuel combustion plant. { Stambouli, A. Boudghene. &quot; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs): a review of an environmentally clean and efficient source of energy &quot;. “Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews&apos;&apos;, Vol. 6, Issue 5, Pages 433-455, October 2002. } The chemical reactions for the SOFC system can be expressed as follows: { &gt; &quot; Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) &quot;. FCTec website&apos;, accessed August 4, 2011 } Anode Reaction: 2H 2 + 2O –2 → 2H 2 O + 4e – Cathode Reaction: O 2 + 4e – → 2O –2 Overall Cell Reaction: 2H 2 + O 2 → 2H 2 O SOFC systems can run on fuels other than pure hydrogen gas. However, since hydrogen is necessary for the reactions listed above, the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms. In order for the fuel cell to operate, the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas. SOFCs are capable of internally reforming light hydrocarbons such as methane (natural gas), propane and butane. Heavier hydrocarbons including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and biofuels can serve as fuels in a SOFC system, but an external reformer is required. Challenges exist in SOFC systems due to their high operating temperatures. One such challenge is the potential for carbon dust to build up on the anode, which slows down the internal reforming process. Research to address this “carbon coking” issue at the University of Pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based cermet (heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal) can reduce coking and the loss of performance. { Hill, Michael. &quot; Ceramic Energy: Material Trends in SOFC Systems &quot;. “Ceramic Industry&apos;&apos;, September 1, 2005. } Another disadvantage of SOFC systems is slow start-up time, making SOFCs less useful for mobile applications. Despite these disadvantages, a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum, thereby reducing cost. Additionally, waste heat from SOFC systems may be captured and reused, increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 80%-85%. The high operating temperature is largely due to the physical properties of the YSZ electrolyte. As temperature decreases, so does the ionic conductivity of YSZ. Therefore, to obtain optimum performance of the fuel cell, a high operating temperature is required. According to their website, Ceres Power, a UK SOFC fuel cell manufacturer, has developed a method of reducing the operating temperature of their SOFC system to 500-600 degrees Celsius. They replaced the commonly used YSZ electrolyte with a CGO (cerium gadolinium oxide) electrolyte. The lower operating temperature allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate, which reduces cost and start-up time of the system. { &quot; The Ceres Cell &quot;. “Ceres Power website&apos;&apos;, accessed August 4, 2011 } [ MCFC ] [ Molten carbonate fuel cell ] Molten carbonate fuel cell s (MCFCs) require a high operating temperature, [ 650 °C on -1 ], similar to SOFC s. MCFCs use lithium potassium carbonate salt as an electrolyte, and at high temperatures, this salt melts into a molten state that allows for the movement of charge (in this case, negative carbonate ions) within the cell. { &quot; Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell Technology &quot;. U.S. Department of Energy, accessed August 9, 2011 } Like SOFCs, MCFCs are capable of converting fossil fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas in the anode, eliminating the need to produce hydrogen externally. The reforming process creates emissions. MCFC-compatible fuels include natural gas, biogas and gas produced from coal. The hydrogen in the gas reacts with carbonate ions from the electrolyte to produce water, carbon dioxide, electrons and small amounts of other chemicals. The electrons travel through an external circuit creating electricity and return to the cathode. There, oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that replenish the electrolyte, completing the circuit. The chemical reactions for an MCFC system can be expressed as follows: { “Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC)”. FCTec.com, accessed August 9, 2011 } Anode Reaction: CO 3 -2 + H 2 → H 2 O + CO 2 + 2e - Cathode Reaction: CO 2 + ½O 2 + 2e - → CO 3 -2 Overall Cell Reaction: H 2 + ½O 2 → H 2 O As with SOFCs, MCFC disadvantages include slow start-up times because of their high operating temperature. This makes MCFC systems not suitable for mobile applications, and this technology will most likely be used for stationary fuel cell purposes. The main challenge of MCFC technology is the cells&apos; short life span. The high temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode. These factors accelerate the degradation of MCFC components, decreasing the durability and cell life. Researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance. MCFCs hold several advantages over other fuel cell technologies, including their resistance to impurities. They are not prone to “carbon coking”, which refers to carbon build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel reforming process. Therefore, carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system. The Department of Energy claims that coal, itself, might even be a fuel option in the future, assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen. MCFCs also have relatively high efficiencies. They can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50%, considerably higher than the 37-42% efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant. Efficiencies can be as high as 65% when the fuel cell is paired with a turbine, and 85% if heat is captured and used in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. FuelCell Energy, a Connecticut-based fuel cell manufacturer, develops and sells MCFC fuel cells. The company says that their MCFC products range from 300  kW to 2.8  MW systems that achieve 47% electrical efficiency and can utilize CHP technology to obtain higher overall efficiencies. One product, the DFC-ERG, is combined with a gas turbine and, according to the company, it achieves an electrical efficiency of 65%. { &quot; Products &quot;.

Merriam-Webster Free Online Dictionary For more information see Glossary of fuel cell terms [ Theoretical maximum efficiency ] The energy efficiency of a system or device that converts energy is measured by the ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system ( &quot; output energy &quot; ) to the total amount of energy that is put in ( &quot; input energy &quot; ) or by useful output energy as a percentage of the total input energy. In the case of fuel cells, useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system. Input energy is the energy stored in the fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells are generally between 40–60% energy efficient. { &quot; Comparison of Fuel Cell Technologies &quot;. U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Fuel Cell Technologies Program, February 2011, accessed August 4, 2011 } This is higher than some other systems for energy generation. For example, the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25% energy efficient. { &quot; Fuel Economy: Where The Energy Goes &quot;. U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Effciency and Renewable Energy, accessed August 3, 2011 } In combined heat and power (CHP) systems, the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use, increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85–90%. The theoretical maximum efficiency of any type of power generation system is rarely reached in practice, and it does not consider other steps in power generation, such as production, transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power. However, this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation. The maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83%, operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants (assuming no heat recapture) { &quot; Fuel Cell Efficiency &quot;. World Energy Council, July 17, 2007, accessed August 4, 2011 } According to the World Energy Council, this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58% for internal combustion engines. While these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications, high temperature fuel cells ( solid oxide fuel cell s or molten carbonate fuel cell s ) can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit. A gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell’s operational efficiency. This solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 70%. { Milewski, J., A. Miller and K.

Solid-oxide fuel cells produce exothermic heat from the recombination of the oxygen and hydrogen. The ceramic can run as hot as 800 degrees Celsius. This heat can be captured and used to heat water in a micro combined heat and power (m-CHP) application. When the heat is captured, total efficiency can reach 80-90% at the unit, but does not consider production and distribution losses. CHP units are being developed today for the European home market. Professor Jeremy P. Meyers, in the Electrochemical Society journal Interface in 2008, wrote, &quot; While fuel cells are efficient relative to combustion engines, they are not as efficient as batteries, due primarily to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction (and... the oxygen evolution reaction, should the hydrogen be formed by electrolysis of water).... [T]hey make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid, or when fuel can be provided continuously.

Fuel cells are very useful as power sources in remote locations, such as spacecraft, remote weather stations, large parks, communications centers, rural locations including research stations, and in certain military applications. A fuel cell system running on hydrogen can be compact and lightweight, and have no major moving parts. Because fuel cells have no moving parts and do not involve combustion, in ideal conditions they can achieve up to 99.9999% reliability.

U.S. Department of Energy Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Alternative Fuel &amp; Advance Vehicle Center. 01/14/2010. } The National Research Council estimated that creating the infrastructure to supply fuel for 10 million FCVs through 2025 would cost the government [ 8 billion ] over 16 years. { Transitions to Alternative Transportation Technologies: A Focus on Hydrogen, NRC 2008, table 6.5 } The first public hydrogen refueling station was opened in Reykjavík, Iceland in April 2003. This station serves three buses built by DaimlerChrysler that are in service in the public transport net of Reykjavík. The station produces the hydrogen it needs by itself, with an electrolyzing unit (produced by Norsk Hydro ), and does not need refilling: all that enters is electricity and water. Royal Dutch Shell is also a partner in the project. The station has no roof, in order to allow any leaked hydrogen to escape to the atmosphere. [ August 2011 ] As part of the California Hydrogen Highway initiative California has the most extensive hydrogen refueling infrastructure in the U.S.A. As of June 2011 California had 22 hydrogen refueling stations in operation. Honda announced plans in March 2011 to open the first station that would generate hydrogen through solar-powered renewable electrolysis. [ August 2011 ] South Carolina also has two hydrogen fueling stations, in Aiken and Columbia, SC. According to the South Carolina Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Alliance, the Columbia station has a current capacity of 120  kg a day, with future plans to develop on-site hydrogen production from electrolysis and reformation. The Aiken station has a current capacity of 80  kg. The University of South Carolina, a founding member of the South Carolina Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Alliance, received 12.5 million dollars from the United States Department of Energy for its Future Fuels Program. { &quot; Cluster Successes in South Carolina &quot;. South Carolina Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Alliance. 200 } Japan also has a hydrogen highway, as part of the Japan hydrogen fuel cell project. Twelve hydrogen fueling stations have been built in 11 cities in Japan. Canada, Sweden and Norway also have hydrogen highway s implemented. [ Markets and economics ] In 2010, fuel cell industry revenues exceeded a $750 million market value worldwide, { &quot; Fuel Cell Industry is Poised for Major Change and Development in 2011 &quot;, Pike Research, February 2, 2011, accessed August 1, 2011 } although, as of 2010, no public company in the industry had yet become profitable. { Wesoff, Eric. &quot; Year-End Reflections on the Fuel Cell Industry in 2010 &quot;. Greentech Media, January 5, 2011, accessed August 3, 2011 } There were 140,000 fuel cell stacks shipped globally in 2010, up from 11 thousand shipments in 2007, and in 2010 worldwide fuel cell shipments had an annual growth rate of 115%. { &quot; Global Fuel Cell Market by Technology, Application, Component, Installation, Cost, Geography, Trends and Forecasts (2011 – 2016) &quot;. May 2011, MarketsandMarkets.com, accessed August 1, 2011 } Approximately 50% of fuel cell shipments in 2010 were stationary fuel cells, up from about a third in 2009, and the four dominant producers in the Fuel Cell Industry remain the United States, Germany, Japan and South Korea. { Adamson, Karry-Ann and Clint Wheelock. &quot; Fuel Cell Annual Report 2011 &quot;. 2Q 2011, Pike Research, accessed August 1, 2011 } The Department of Energy Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance found that, as of January 2011, stationary fuel cells generated power at approximately $724 to $775 per kilowatt installed. { &quot; Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance SECA Cost Reduction &quot;. U.S. Dept. of Energy, January 31, 2011, accessed August 1, 2011 } Bloom Energy, a major fuel cell supplier, says its fuel cells will meet a return on investment in 3–5 years, as its fuel cells generate power at 9-11 cents per kilowatt-hour, including the price of fuel, maintenance, and hardware. { &quot; Lower &amp; Lock-In Energy Costs &quot;. Bloom Energy, accessed August 3, 2011 } { Wesoff, Eric. &quot; Bloom Energy Plays the Subsidy Game Like a Pro &quot;, April 13, 2011, accessed August 1, 2011 } Low temperature fuel cell stacks proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) use a platinum catalyst. Impurities create catalyst poisoning (reducing activity and efficiency) in these low-temperature fuel cells, thus high hydrogen purity or higher catalyst densities are required. [ Fuel Processing Catalysts for Hydrogen Reformate Generation for PEM Fuel Cells Anca Faur-Ghenciu FuelCell Magazine April/May 2003 http://www.fuelcell-magazine.com/eprints/free/johnsonmattheyapril03.pdf PDF 2007-05-27 ] [ September 2009 ] Although there are sufficient platinum resources for future demand, { International Platinum Group Metals Association-FAQ } most predictions of platinum running out and/or platinum prices soaring do not take into account effects of reduction in catalyst loading and recycling. Recent research at Brookhaven National Laboratory could lead to the replacement of platinum by a gold - palladium coating which may be less susceptible to poisoning and thereby improve fuel cell lifetime considerably. [ Gold is key to ending platinum dissolution in fuel cells EETimes.com 2007-01-22 R. Colin Johnson http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID%3D196901214 2007-05-27 ] Another method would use iron and sulphur instead of platinum. This is possible through an intermediate conversion by bacteria. This would lower the cost of a fuel cell substantially (as the platinum in a regular fuel cell costs around [ 1500 ], and the same amount of iron costs only around [ 1.50 ] ). The concept is being developed by a coalition of the John Innes Centre and the University of Milan-Bicocca. { Replacement of platinum by iron-sulpher } PEDOT cathodes are immune to monoxide poisoning. { Fuel cell improvements raise hopes for clean, cheap energy } Current targets for a transport PEM fuel cells are 0.2 g/kW Pt – which is a factor of 5 decrease over current loadings – and recent comments from major original equipment manufacturer s (OEMs) indicate that this is possible. Recycling of fuel cells components, including platinum, will conserve supplies. High-temperature fuel cells, including molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC&apos;s) and solid oxide fuel cell s (SOFC&apos;s), do not use platinum as catalysts, but instead use cheaper materials such as nickel and nickel oxide. They also do not experience catalyst poisoning by carbon monoxide, and so they do not require high-purity hydrogen to operate. They can use fuels with an existing and extensive infrastructure, such as natural gas, directly, without having to first reform it externally to hydrogen and CO followed by CO removal. [ Research and development ] [ Chemical Could Revolutionize Polymer Fuel Cells Georgia Institute of Technology 2005-08-24 http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id%3D618 2007-05-27 ] August 2005: Georgia Institute of Technology researchers use triazole to raise the operating temperature of PEM fuel cells from below 100 °C to over 125 °C, claiming this will require less carbon-monoxide purification of the hydrogen fuel. 2008 Monash University, Melbourne uses PEDOT as a cathode. 2009 Researchers at the University of Dayton, in Ohio, show that arrays of vertically grown carbon nanotubes could be used as the catalyst in fuel cells.
