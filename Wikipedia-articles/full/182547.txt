The Kennet and Avon canal runs to the north of Trowbridge and played a large part in the development of the town as it allowed coal to be transported from the Somerset Coalfield. The town was also a major centre in the textile industry in south west England in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and was described as &quot; The Manchester of the West &quot;. [ http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id%3D228 Wiltshire Council – Wiltshire Community History Get Community Information history.wiltshire.gov.uk 4 March 2011 ] Trowbridge has a railway station on the Wessex Main Line. The civil parish of Trowbridge had a population of 28,163 at the 2001 census, making it the third largest settlement in the county after the town of Swindon and the city of Salisbury. Neighbouring towns and villages include Bradford on Avon, Westbury, Melksham, Devizes, Hilperton, Southwick and Semington. [ History ] [ Name ] The origin of the name Trowbridge is uncertain; one source claims derivation from treow-brycg, meaning &quot; Tree Bridge &quot;, referring to the first bridge over the Biss, { Town Official Guide, Trowbridge Town Council, 2008 } { Origins of the name Trowbridge : Strum.co.uk website. Retrieved on 25 January 2008. } while another states that the true meaning is the bridge by Trowle, the name of a hamlet and a common to the west of the town. [ Lewis Harold The Church Rambler, Volume 2 Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co. 1978 199–226 ] On John Speed &apos;s map of Wiltshire (1611), the name is spelt Trubridge. [ Ancient history and the Domesday Book ] There is evidence that the land on which Trowbridge is built was being farmed more than 3,000 years ago. In the 10th century there is clear evidence of Trowbridge&apos;s existence and in the Domesday Book the village of Straburg, as Trowbridge was then known, was recorded as having 100 residents. [ Castle ] The first mention of Trowbridge Castle was in 1139 { First mention of Trowbridge Castle : Local Authority Publishing website. Retrieved on 25 January 2008. } while it was besieged – so it must have been built before this. The castle is thought to have been a motte-and-bailey castle, and its influences can still be seen in the town today. Fore Street follows the path of the castle ditch, [ Graham, Alan H. and Susan M. Davies Excavations in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, 1977 and 1986–1988: The Prehistoric, Saxon, and Saxo-Norman Settlements and the Anarchy Period Castle 1993 Wessex Archaeology Salisbury 1 ] and its name is given to Castle Street and the Castle Place Shopping Centre. [ Wool industry ] From the 13th century onwards Trowbridge developed a clothing industry, increasingly becoming industrialised from the 17th century onwards. However increasing mechanisation was resisted by workers in traditional trades and there were riots in 1785, 1792 and in the era of luddism due to the introduction of the flying shuttle. [ http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/55/horn.html Machine-breaking in England and France during the Age of Revolution 16 March 2008 ] Thomas Helliker, a shearman&apos;s apprentice, became one of the martyrs of the Industrial Revolution in 1803 when he was hanged at Salisbury. Nevertheless at one point in 1820 Trowbridge was being described as the &quot; Manchester of the West &quot; as it had over 2,000 wool-producing factories, comparable to Northern industrial towns such as Rochdale. [ http://www.trowbridge.gov.uk/business.asp?id%3D222 Economic History 16 March 2008 ] The wool industry declined in the late 19th century with the advent of ring-spinning and this decline continued throughout the 20th century. The last mill, Salter&apos;s Home Mill, closed in 1982 and is now the home of Trowbridge Museum, { The Trowbridge Woollen Industry as Illustrated by the Stock Books of John and Thomas Clark, 1804–1824, John Clark &amp; Thomas Clark &amp; R.

Clark&apos;s Mill is now home to offices and the County Court; straddling the nearby River Biss is &quot; The Handle House &quot;, formerly used for drying and storage of teazle s used to raise the nap of cloth. This is one of very few such buildings still known to exist in the United Kingdom.

Food production also developed in the town when Abraham Bowyer started his business in 1805 which eventually, as Pork Farms Bowyers, became one of the largest employers in the town until closure in April 2008 when production moved to the Shaftesbury and Nottingham factories. The town became the county town of Wiltshire in 1889 when Wiltshire County Council was formed and needed a place where representatives from Swindon and Salisbury, among others, could reach and return home in one day. Trowbridge fulfilled this criterion by dint of its railway connections and thus evolved as the county town, further reinforced by the construction of the county hall in 1939. { http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=51 } The brewing company Ushers of Trowbridge opened in 1824, and developed the brewery in the town – this was finally shut in 2000 following several changes of ownership. Food production continues in the town through companies such as frozen food processor Apetito. The largest employers in the town are Wiltshire Council, and Apetito.
