[ May 2012 ] { World Can&apos;t Wait rally in Washington D.C. } Flag desecration (or flag abuse) is a term applied to various acts that intentionally destroy, damage or mutilate a flag in public, most often a national flag. Often, such action is intended to make a political point against a country or its policies. Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country&apos;s own national flag and flags of other countries. Some countries have laws protecting the right to burn a flag as free speech. [ Background ] Actions that may be treated as flag desecration include: [ Charney Evan Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Voices, and Viewpoints [ 2009 M.E. Sharpe 978-0-7656-1761-3 180 Vol 1 Roger Chapman ] [ Goldstein Robert Justin Burning the Flag: The Great 1989–1990 American Flag Desecration Controversy 2006 Kent State University Press 978-0-87338-598-5 293 ] Hanging it upside down or reversed. In some countries, however, this is also conventional protocol to indicate an emergency or problem. Making toilet paper, napkins, doormats, and other such items bearing the image of the flag, so that the flag&apos;s image will be destroyed or soiled in the course of everyday activities. It is increasingly common to see clothing with the image of the flags forming a substantial part of the piece. Views vary as to whether some of this is an act of national pride or disrespect. Such actions may be undertaken for a variety of reasons: As a protest against a country&apos;s foreign policy. To distance oneself from the foreign or domestic policies of one&apos;s home country. As a protest at the very laws prohibiting the actions in question. As a protest against nationalism. As a protest against the government in power in the country, or against the country&apos;s form of government. A symbolic insult to the people of that country. In common usage, the phrase &apos;flag burning&apos; refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest. However the United States Flag Code states that &quot; the flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning &quot;. [ http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/flagetiq.html Flag Rules and Regulations Ushistory.org 1 September 2010 ] As described below burning or defacing a flag is a crime in some countries. In countries where it is not a crime the act may still be prosecuted as disorderly conduct, arson or theft if conducted against someone else&apos;s property. [ Flag desecration by country ] [ Australia ] [ Flag of Australia ] During the 2005 Cronulla riots, a Lebanese-Australian youth, whose name has been kept secret, climbed an RSL club building and tore down its flag before setting it on fire.

Flemish nationalists have burned Belgian flags on at least one occasion. { See this article in french-speaking La Libre Belgique } [ Canada ] [ Flag of Canada ] Flag desecration is not forbidden by Canadian law [ January 2012 ]. In 1990, during heated political times around the Meech Lake Accord, the flag of Quebec was desecrated by protestors in Brockville, Ontario opposed to Quebec&apos;s language laws after the Canadian flag had been burnt in protests in Quebec. Televised images of individuals stepping on the Quebec flag were played in Quebec and contributed to the deterioration in relations between Quebec and English Canada. The incident, seen as a metaphor of Canada&apos;s perceived rejection of Quebec (and of Quebec&apos;s distinctiveness in the demise of the Meech Lake Accord) was invoked by Quebec nationalists during the run-up to the 1995 referendum on Quebec independence and is still remembered today [ January 2012 ]. In 1999, members of the Westboro Baptist Church from the United States staged a burning of the Canadian Flag outside of the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. This was to protest legalization of same-sex marriage which was being adjudicated by the Canadian court [ January 2012 ]. [ China ] Flag desecration is prohibited in China. The penal code { Criminal Law of the People&apos;s Republic of China } provides for an imprisonment up to three years, criminal detention, public surveillance, or deprivation of political rights for anyone who &quot; desecrate[s] the National Flag or the National Emblem of the People&apos;s Republic of China by intentionally burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling upon it in public &quot;. [ Hong Kong ] The national laws about flag desecration were incorporated into local laws as the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance and the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance in 1997 as required by Annex III of the region&apos;s Basic Law. The ordinances ban desecration of the regional and national flag. In 1999 Ng Kung Siu and Lee Kin Yun were convicted for desecration of the regional flag of Hong Kong and the National flag.

In modern Croatia it is illegal to desecrate or to treat any flag in a disrespecting manner. Offenders are punished with up to 3 years of imprisonment [ January 2012 ]. [ Denmark ] It is illegal in Denmark, under section 110 (e) of the Danish penal code, to desecrate the flags or national symbols of foreign nations, while legal to burn the Dannebrog, Denmark&apos;s national flag. The reasoning of parliament was: the burning of foreign flags falls into the realm of foreign policy, as the burning of the flag of another country could be understood as a threat to that country. The burning of the Dannebrog, on the other hand, does not concern foreign countries, does not fall under foreign affairs, and so remains legal. According to Danish tradition, burning is also the proper way to dispose of a worn flag.

Flying the flag after sundown is also inappropriate behaviour.

[ France ] According to French law, { Loi n°2003-239 du 18 mars 2003 pour la sécurité intérieure De l&apos;outrage } outraging the French national anthem or the French flag during an event organized or regulated by public authorities is liable for a fine of €7,500 (and six months&apos; imprisonment if performed in a gathering). The law targets outrageous behaviour during public ceremonies and major sports events. This clause was added as an amendment to a large bill dealing with internal security, in reaction to a football match during which there had been whistles against La Marseillaise, but also to similar actions during public ceremonies. { Proceedings of the French national assembly, second sitting of 23 January 2003 } The amendment initially prohibiting such outrage regardless of the context, but a parliamentary commission later restricted its scope to events organized or regulated by public authorities, { Report from the mixed National Assembly/Senate commission } — which is to be understood, according to the ruling of the Constitutional Council as events organized by public authorities, mass sport matches and other mass events taking place in enclosures, but not private speech, literary or artistic works, or speech during events not organized or regulated by public authorities. { The } { Constitutional Council considered that the events regulated by public authorities consist in public events of a sportive, recreative or cultural character organized in enclosures that law and regulations submit to health and safety rules because of their size. See Decision 2003-467 DC, section 104. } In 2006, a man who had publicly burnt a French flag stolen from the façade of the city hall of Aurillac during a public festival, organized and regulated by public authorities, was sentenced to a €300 fine. { Ruling of 14 June 2006 by the Court of Appeal of } { Riom } A July 2010 law makes it a crime to desecrate the French national flag in a public place, but also to distribute images of a flag desecration, even when done in a private setting. { Décret n° 2010-835 du 21 juillet 2010 relatif à l&apos;incrimination de l&apos;outrage au drapeau tricolore } On 22 December 2010, an Algerian national was the first person to be convicted under the new status, and ordered to pay a €750 after breaking the pole of a flag hung in the Alpes-Maritimes prefecture a day prior. { Un Algérien condamné pour outrage au drapeau français, &apos;&apos;Le Monde&apos;&apos;, 12 December 2010 } [ Germany ] German flags being burned during a protest in Nuremberg, 2006. Under German criminal code (§90a Strafgesetzbuch (StGB)) it is illegal to revile or damage the German federal flag as well as any flags of its states in public. Offenders can be fined or sentenced for a maximum of three years in prison. Offenders can be fined or sentenced for a maximum of five years in prison if the act was intentionally used to support the eradication of the Federal Republic of Germany or to violate constitutional rights. Actual convictions because of a violation of the criminal code need to be balanced against the constitutional right of the freedom of expressions, as ruled multiple times by German&apos;s constitutional court. As for flags of foreign countries, it is illegal to damage or revile them, if they are shown publicly by tradition, event or routinely by representatives of the foreign entity (§104 StGB). On the other hand it is not illegal to desecrate such flags that serve no official purpose (especially including any the one willing to desecrate them brings by himself for that purpose). During the 2006 World Cup the anti-German German musician Torsun (half of the group Egotronic ) recorded a techno cover of the song &quot; Ten German Bombers &quot;. The song and its accompanying YouTube video (featuring footage of German planes being shot down, the Wembley goal, a burning German flag, etc.) attracted media attention in Germany, as well as from the British tabloid News of the World. The song was eventually included in the World Cup themed compilation Weltmeister Hits 2006. { http://www.amazon.de/Ballermann-Balneario-Pr%C3%A4s-Weltmeister-Hits-2006/dp/B000FDFXMM } { http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite &amp; dig=2006/06/02/a0118 } { http://www.laut.de/vorlaut/news/2006/04/12/01854/index.htm } [ Nazi flag ] On 26 July 1935 in New York a group of demonstrators boarded the SS Bremen, tore the Nazi party flag from the jackstaff and threw it into the Hudson River. The German ambassador sharply protested, but the protest was resent claiming only a party symbol was harmed and the national flag was not affected. On 15 September 1935 the Reichsflaggengesetz (Reichs flag law) (RGBl. I S. 1145) came into effect, declaring the Nazi flag to be the exclusive national flag of Germany in response to this incident, removing the status of the original flag of the Weimar Republic as co-national flag. In January 1941, the Flag of Nazi Germany flying from the German consulate in San Francisco was slashed and torn down by two United States Navy sailors. They were arrested, tried and convicted of malicious mischief. { WAR &amp; PEACE: Liberty Cabbage, } { Time Magazine, 27 January 1941 } The German government protested the incident and the United States Department of State expressed their regrets. { German Protest Over Flag Incident is Made Public, } { St. Petersburg Times, 22 January 1941 } Later that year, after Germany declared war on the United States, one of the sailors, Harold Sturtevant, reenlisted in the Navy after having been dismissed because of the incident. { Pardoned Sailer Reassigned to Ship, } { Milwaukee Journal, 22 December 1941 } Today Nazism and Nazi symbols are rejected by Germany and, according to the criminal code Strafgesetzbuch section 86a, the public use or dissemination of Nazi symbols like the flag is illegal in Germany. [ Hungary ] { Hungarian Parliament Building } During a demonstration at the beginning of the Hungarian revolution of 1956 someone in the crowd cut out the communist coat of arms from the Hungarian flag, leaving a distinctive hole and others quickly followed suit.

The Bureau of Indian Standards is in charge of the enforcement of the manufacture of the flag according to the guidelines. Violation of the code may invite severe punishments and penalties. The code was written in 2002 and merged the following acts: provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 (No.12 of 1950) and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 (No. 69 of 1971). The Indian Flag Code was often criticized for being too rigid and prevented ordinary citizens from displaying the flag on homes and other buildings. For many years, only government officials and other government buildings could unfurl the flag. That changed in 2001 when Naveen Jindal won a court case in the Supreme Court of India to give Indians the right to unfurl the flag publicly. The Indian cricket batsman Sachin Tendulkar was accused of sporting the flag on his cricket helmet below the BCCI emblem. He later changed it and placed the flag above BCCI emblem. The flag code was updated in 2005; some new provisions include that the flag cannot be worn under the waist or on undergarments.

In May 1958, Flag of the People&apos;s Republic of China at a postage stamp convention was pulled down and damaged, but as Japan did not recognize People&apos;s Republic of China at the time, the law was not applied. In February 2011, Japanese ultra-rightists held a protest over the Kuril islands dispute outside of the Russian embassy in Tokyo, during which they dragged a Russian flag on the ground; Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov stated that his ministry had asked the Japanese government to launch a criminal case over the incident. { Rian.ru: Russia calls for probe into provocative actions of Japanese extremists } However, there has never been a law explicitly prohibiting desecration of Flag of Japan. Absent such law, the act of desecration is implicitly protected by Article 21 &quot; Freedom of speech &quot; of Constitution of Japan.

The Ministry that overlooks the use of National Symbols had requested 4 years in jail. The judge only applied a small fine and a public warning. [ New Zealand ] In New Zealand, under the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 it is illegal to destroy the New Zealand flag with the intent of dishonouring it. In 2003, Paul Hopkinson, a Wellington schoolteacher, burned the Flag of New Zealand as part of a protest in Parliament grounds at the New Zealand Government&apos;s hosting of the Prime Minister of Australia, against the background of Australia&apos;s support of the United States in its war in Iraq. Hopkinson was initially convicted under Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 of destroying a New Zealand flag with intent to dishonour it, but appealed against his conviction. On appeal, his conviction was overturned on the grounds that the law had to be read consistently with the right to freedom of expression under the Bill of Rights. This meant that his actions were not unlawful because the word dishonour in the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act had many shades of meaning, and when the least restrictive meaning of that word was adopted Hopkinson&apos;s actions did not meet that standard. This somewhat unusual result was due in part to the fact that the Bill of Rights does not overrule other laws ( Hopkinson v. Police ). In 2011 the New Zealand Supreme Court ruled that burning the flag at an ANZAC day dawn service was not offensive behaviour.

During the scuffle a Panamanian flag carried by Panamanian students was torn. This sparked four days of riots that ended with 22 Panamanians and four Americans dead, and with Panama breaking diplomatic relations with the United States. This event is considered to be very important in the decision to negotiate and sign the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, that allowed that the Panama Canal administration was handed over to the Panamanian Government on 31 December 1999. 9 January is known as Martyrs&apos; Day and it is commemorated in Panama as a day of mourning [ January 2012 ].

In the case of the regional symbols, the person shall be punished with up to one year imprisonment or a fine of up to 120 days (fines are calculated based on the defendant&apos;s income). The Portuguese Penal Code (article 323) also forbids the desecration of foreign symbols: &quot; Who publicly, by means of words, gestures or print publication, or by other means of public communication, insults the official flag or other symbol of sovereignty of a foreign State or of an international organization of which Portugal is a member shall be punished with up to one year imprisonment or a fine of up to 120 days. &quot; This article applies under two conditions (article 324): that Portugal maintains diplomatic relations with the insulted country, and that there is reciprocity (i.e., that the insulted country would also punish any insult against Portuguese symbols of sovereignty, should they occur there). [ Romania ] In Romania, according to the article 236 of the penal code, any manifestation which expresses contempt for the Romanian symbols (according to the constitution, these are the flag, national day, anthem and coat-of-arms) is punished by imprisonment, from 6 months to 3 years, while the contempt for the symbols of Romanian authorities is also punished by imprisonment, from 3 months to 1 year, or by fine. { Romanian Penal Code (2008) } This law has been seen in a report of the Press Monitoring Agency, a project financed by the Open Society Institute, as being a potential danger to the freedom of expression because of its vague terms, because it can incriminate opinions. { Agenţia de Monitorizare a Presei – } { Academia Caţavencu, &quot; Programul FreeEx – Libertatea presei în România în anul 2003 &quot;, March 2004 } During the 1989 Romanian Revolution, the Communist era flag was flown with a hole on the coat of arms [ January 2012 ]. [ Saudi Arabia ] The flag of Saudi Arabia bears the shahada or Islamic declaration of faith. Because the shahada is considered holy, Saudi Arabia&apos;s flag code is extremely strict and even the slightest violation amounts to desecration not only of the flag but also of Islam itself. This has led to several incidents of controversy. In 1994, McDonald&apos;s printed carry-out bags bearing the flags of all nations participating in the FIFA World Cup (with a green flag with Saudi Arabia&apos;s coat of arms superimposed, rather than the Saudi flag), while Coca-Cola did the same on cans of soda. Because of Saudi outrage, the companies stopped producing those items. { Paul A. Herbig, Handbook of Cross-Cultural Marketing, pg. 20 } Also during the FIFA World Cup, in 2002, Saudi officials protested against printing the flag on a football on the belief that kicking the creed with the foot was totally unacceptable. [ Soviet Union ] The flag of the Soviet Union has been burned many times by protestors against its government&apos;s policies. For instance in Brazil by those protesting the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia of 1968, { Protest against Czech invasions mounts in capitals of the world, } { UPI, 22 August 1968 } and in New York City in 1985 by protesters against the Soviet War in Afghanistan. { Afghans Protest Soviet Presence, } { New York Times, 22 March 1985 } [ Serbia ] In Serbia, flag desecration is illegal and on 20 May 2009 secretary general of the International Workers&apos; Association Ratibor Trivunac was arrested and punished with 10 days in prison for burning an American flag during the visit of the US Vice President Joe Biden. Due to the mass demonstrations and protests, he was freed from prison two days later [ January 2012 ]. [ Sweden ] The desecration of national symbols is not specifically criminal, but flag desecration is prosecuted under the more general clauses against disorderly conduct [ January 2012 ]. [ Switzerland ] Destruction, removal or desecration of national emblems installed by a public authority (i.e., the Swiss flag, the Swiss coat of arms, the cantonal or municipal flags and coats of arms) is punishable by a monetary penalty or imprisonment of up to three years according to the Swiss federal penal code. [ 311.0 311_0 270 Swiss Penal Code ] The destruction or desecration of privately owned flags or coats of arms is legal [ January 2012 ]. [ Turkey ] The flag of Turkey bears the star and crescent over a field of color red that represents the blood of martyrs which is considered sacred. Under the 1983 Turkish flag law, burning the flag is strictly forbidden, punishable by a prison sentence of three years. Displaying or pulling a torn or discolored flag to flagpole is also illegal. Taking down the flag is prohibited and punishable by a prison sentence of eighteen years [ January 2012 ]. [ United Kingdom ] { Ulster loyalists prepare to burn the } { Irish tricolour on a bonfire on the eve of } { The Twelfth in } { Belfast } Neither the law of England and Wales nor the law of Scotland has a concept of &quot; flag desecration. &quot; In May 1998, in a protest by 2000 ex-PoWs, a Burma Railway veteran torched the Rising Sun banner before both Emperor Akihito and the Queen. Police were moved by the crowd not to arrest him. { Macaskill, Jamie. A BURNING FURY } { Daily Record Glasgow (UK) 27 May 1998 } A year later, two &quot; committed socialists &quot; threw a burning Union flag in the direction of the Queen &apos;s motor vehicle. They were arrested under breach of the peace, subsequently pleaded guilty and were fined a total £450. { Evening News Edinburgh (UK) Burning flag socialists fined GBP 450 13 Oct 1999 } In 2001 at RAF Feltwell, home of United States Air Force &apos;s 5th Space Surveillance Squadron, a protestor defaced the US Flag with the words &quot; Stop Star Wars &quot; before stepping in front of a vehicle and stamping on the flag. Her conviction under S5 Public Order Act 1986, was overturned as incompatible with article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. { The Times Conviction for defacing flag is incompatible 21 Jan 2002 } In 2011, a republican core of c. 20/30 [ September 2011 ] King&apos;s College, Cambridge students influenced the burning of a large Union flag, the centrepiece of the Student Union &apos;s decorations to celebrate the royal wedding.

Cambridge students mark Duke&apos;s wedding by burning Union flag: Protest } { The Daily Telegraph 2 May 2011 } In 2006, to allow greater police control over extremist Muslim protesters, 17 MPs signed a House of Commons motion calling for burning of the Union Flag to be made a criminal offence. { Walker, Jonathan. Burning issue for MPs } { Birmingham Mail 1 Dec 2006 } [ Northern Ireland ] [ Northern Ireland flags issue ] Unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, the law in Northern Ireland has varied since its foundation in 1921. The Union Flag of the United Kingdom, the former Flag of Northern Ireland, and the tricolour of the Republic of Ireland are often defaced or burnt in Northern Ireland as a political provocation or as a protest. [ NI ] [ British military colours ] The Queen&apos;s Colour s and Regimental Colour s are a very important symbol for a British Army regiment and for many regiments in the Commonwealth which have inherited the British Army&apos;s traditions. In a Line Regiment the Colour stand consists of these two flags, and damage to such a symbol would be a considered a great insult to the regiment by its members. In the British armed forces, it is usual for flag-bearers to lower flags and standards, even Queen&apos;s and Regimental Colours, so that they are draped on the ground, as part of a Royal Salute or during the two-minute silence on Remembrance Sunday. This mark of respect, known as vailing, is not considered to be a desecration of the colours. [ United States ] The flag of the United States is sometimes symbolically burnt, often in protest of the policies of the American government, both within the country and abroad. The United States Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson, [ 491 397 1989 ], and reaffirmed in U.S. v. Eichman, [ 496 310 1990 ], has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipality) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as &quot; symbolic speech. &quot; However, content-neutral restrictions may still be imposed to regulate the time, place, and manner of such expression. In 1862, during the Union army&apos;s occupation of New Orleans in the American Civil War, the military governor, Benjamin Franklin Butler, sentenced William B. Mumford to death for removing an American flag. In 1864 John Greenleaf Whittier wrote the poem Barbara Frietchie, which told of a (probably fictional) incident in which Confederate soldiers were deterred from defacing an American flag. The poem contains the famous lines: &quot; Shoot, if you must, this old gray head, But spare your country&apos;s flag, &quot; she said. During the United States involvement in the Vietnam War American flags were sometimes burned during anti-war protest demonstrations. { Forget Flag Burning, } { Time, 25 June 2006 } After the Johnson and Eichman decisions, several flag burning amendments to the Constitution were proposed. On 22 June 2005, a Flag Desecration Amendment was passed by the House with the needed two-thirds majority. On 27 June 2006, another attempt to pass a ban on flag burning was rejected by the Senate in a close vote of 65 in favor, 34 opposed, one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to send the amendment to be voted on by the states.

In 2000 protesters from the Jewish Defense League burned Confederate and Nazi flags to protest an arson attempt against a Reno, Nevada synagogue. This was criticized by a representative of the Anti-Defamation League who said that it was more effective to work with the police and other authorities rather than to engage in &quot; tactics which inflame and exacerbate situations. &quot; { Counter-protest in Reno by right-wing Jews angers ADL, } { J., 21 July 2000. } [ Rainbow Flag ] In 1999, three protesters tore down and burned a Rainbow Flag, standing for gay rights, from the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. The flag had been flying in honor of Gay and Lesbian Pride Month which had just been declared by President Bill Clinton. The flag burners were arrested by the Ohio State Highway Patrol and charged with misdemeanor counts of arson and disorderly conduct. { Gay Flag Burned; Charges Filed, CNSNews.com, 29 June 1999 } [ Venezuela ] Since the demonstrations against the refusal by the government to renew the broadcasting license of RCTV (a major TV network), the upside-down flag of Venezuela has been adopted as a symbol of protest for this and other alleged threats to civil liberties. Demonstrators claim that it is a sign of distress and a call for help. However, government and ruling-party officials insist that these demonstrators are desecrating the flag, manipulated by the enemies of the people. An official video sharply criticizing this practice as disrespectful and traitorous was produced, and private TV networks have been ordered to transmit it for free. { Official Venezuelan propaganda criticizing flag turning, with notice of protest prepended by } { Globovisión } Globovisión prepended to the video a statement denouncing the message as violative of the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television, &quot; for constituting anonymous official propaganda &quot; [ January 2012 ]. [ United Nations ] In 2006 a United Nations flag was burned during a political campaign in Austin, Texas, USA in protest against United Nations policy. The other candidate later claimed that it was an American flag that was burned. { Voter apathy plays part in Pflugerville runoff, KVUE, 8 April 2006 } In 2009 a UN flag was dragged on the ground to show disrespect in a Tea Party protest in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. { Tax Protesters Gather, Jackson Hole Daily, 16 April 2009 } [ See also ] Flag protocol Flag disposal Flag Desecration Amendment [ Notes ] [ Gillingham ] [ ChrisRyder ] [ NI ] [ FinnishFlagLaw ] Flagging concern: the controversy over flags and emblems by Robin Wilson, Democratic Dialogue July 2000 &quot;.DOC &quot; format: Flags Regulations [ References ] [ 30em ] [ External links ] [ Flag burning ] The Flag Burning Page USA Flag Burning Archive Flag amendment fails by one vote Flag burning online Citizen&apos;s Flag alliance; reports of flag burning in 2006 The Pros and Cons of Flag Burning Category:Flags Category:Protest tactics Category:Civil disobedience Category:Flag controversies ca:Ultratge a la bandera de:Flaggenverbrennung es:Profanación de bandera hr:Spaljivanje zastave it:Vilipendio alla bandiera mk:Сквернавење на знаме no:Flaggskjending ru:Надругательство над флагом sv:Flaggbränning
