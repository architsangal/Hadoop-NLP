It was, for many years, Puerto Rico&apos;s largest indoor event facility, and it continues being one of the largest. [ General information ] The Coliseum is named after baseball hall of famer Roberto Clemente, who died in a plane crash off Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Carolina in 1972, while flying with relief articles to be given to victims of the Nicaragua earthquake. Construction of the facility began in the early 1970s, it was finished in January 1973, and inaugurated in February of that year by the Fania All-Stars. The coliseum has been host to a variety of events, including world championship boxing and basketball, business expos, circus, concerts and other things. Many Puerto Rican and international performers have been there, among others. Here are some concerts that have been held there: Saga/FM: Silent Knight/City Of Fear Tour - January 10, 1981 (The photo that appears on the Worlds Apart Album was shot there) Judas Priest: Point Of Entry Tour - December 15, 1981 Quiet Riot: Metal Health Tour - December 3, 1983 Chicago - August 17, 1984 Bon Jovi/Ratt: The World Infestation Tour &apos;85 - December 13, 1985 W.A.S.P./Kiss: Asylum Tour - January 12, 1986 John Butcher Axis/Night Ranger: Seven Wishes Tour - February 8, 1986 Hall &amp; Oates - May 16, 1986 Loverboy/Dokken: Under Lock And Key Tour - July 26, 1986 Rough Cutt/Dio: Sacred Heart Tour - October 11, 1986 Cyndi Lauper: True Colors Tour - January 3, 1987 38 Special/Kansas: Drastic Measures Tour - January 31, 1987 Duran Duran: Strange Behavior Tour - August 7, 1987 Def Leppard: Hysteria Tour - January 2, 1988 Triumph: A Sport Of Kings Tour - March 25, 1988 Saga - April 22, 1988 R.E.O.

It has been the home of three different BSN professional basketball teams and the BSN has also used it as a neutral site for their most important games, including game 7 of the championship finals, several times. The Coliseum has also been used by religious leaders for conferences and religious services. Most of the world championship boxing bouts fought in Puerto Rico during the late 1970s and early 1980s were fought at the Roberto Clemente coliseum, including Roberto Durán &apos;s world title defense versus Mexican Leoncio Ortiz, Wilfredo Gómez &apos;s knockout win against Carlos Zarate, many of Samuel Serrano &apos;s title defenses, and the fight where Muhammad Ali defended his title against Jean Pierre Coopman, the only time a world Heavyweight championship fight has been held in Puerto Rico. George Foreman had his last fight (and experienced the vision that led him to become a born-again Christian in one of its dressing rooms) before announcing his first retirement there, and Julio César Chávez had one of his first important fights there, on the undercard of Edwin Rosario &apos;s world Lightweight championship win against José Luis Ramírez. Because of all the boxing action going on during that era, many observers call the period from the middle &apos;70s to the middle &apos;80s as the golden age of boxing in Puerto Rico. The arena also hosted the final phase of the 1974 World Basketball championship { NBA.com, Puerto Rico, sede del Pre-Olímpico Américas 2003, 9 December 2002 } The Clemente coliseum has also been the place of large political rallies, and Puerto Rico&apos;s electoral commission uses its facilities to count votes after each election. It also hosted Miss Universe 2002, won by Justine Pasek of Panama. [ Notes ] [ See also ] [ Puerto Rico Sports Architecture ] List of notable Puerto Rican buildings and structures.
