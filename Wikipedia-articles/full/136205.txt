[ 1 ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of [ 5.9 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. [ Origin ] Hebbronville is located on land which once formed part of Las Noriecitas, one of the earliest ranches founded in the area. The town&apos;s namesake, James Richard Hebbron, acquired land, in about 1880, from the descendants of the original grantee, Ingacio Benavides. With two others, he bought 18,000 acres, in the then Duval County, just above Peña. One of his sons, Arthur Hebbron, came down from California and took charge of running his ranch. Hebbronville itself was created in 1883, when the Texas-Mexican Railway Company built a railroad through the area. Francisco P. Peña, operator of Peña Station on this route, refused to sell any land to the Texas-Mexican for a townsite. The company then approached J. R. Hebbron, who arranged for the sale of land for the new townsite, near Peñitas. The old train station at Peñitas was then loaded onto a flatcar, moved 1½ miles west and named Hebbronville. For a time, Hebbronville ranked as the largest cattle-shipping center in the country and it continues to be a hub of ranching activity. A photograph of James R. Hebbron hangs in the Jim Hogg County Courthouse, 102, East Tilley Street, Hebbronville.
