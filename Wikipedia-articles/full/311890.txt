Medill Reports Chicago. http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=79817 } [ Signs and symptoms ] The disorder is characterized by episodes of intense facial pain that last from a few seconds to several minutes or hours. The episodes of intense pain may occur paroxysm ally. To describe the pain sensation, patients may describe a trigger area on the face so sensitive that touching or even air currents can trigger an episode; however, in many patients the pain is generated spontaneously without any apparent stimulation. It affects lifestyle as it can be triggered by common activities such as eating, talking, shaving and brushing teeth. Wind, high pitched sounds, loud noises such as concerts or crowds, chewing, and talking can aggravate the condition in many patients. The attacks are said by those affected to feel like stabbing electric shock s, burning, pressing, crushing, exploding or shooting pain that becomes intractable. Individual attacks usually affect one side of the face at a time, lasting from several seconds to a few minutes and repeat up to hundreds of times throughout the day. The pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years. 10-12% of cases are bilateral, or occurring on both sides. This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves since one serves strictly the left side of the face and the other serves the right side. Pain attacks are known to worsen in frequency or severity over time, in some patients. Many patients develop the pain in one branch, then over years the pain will travel through the other nerve branches. Some patients also experience pain in the index finger. [ Bayer DB, Stenger TG Trigeminal neuralgia: an overview Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol 48 5 393–9 1979 226915 10.1016/0030-4220(79)90064-1 ] It may slowly spread to involve more extensive portions of the trigeminal nerve. The spread may even affect all divisions of the nerve, and sometimes simultaneously. Cases with bilateral involvement have not indicated simultaneous activity. The following suggest a systemic development: rapid spreading, bilateral involvement or simultaneous participation with other major nerve trunks. Examples of systemic involvement include multiple sclerosis or expanding cranial tumor. Examples of simultaneous involvement include tic convulsive (of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves) and occurrence of symptoms in the fifth and ninth cranial nerve areas. [ Okeson JP Bell&apos;s orofacial pains: the clinical management of orofacial pain 2005 Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc 0-86715-439-X 453 http://www.quintpub.com/display_detail.php3?psku%3DB439X Lindsay Harmon 17 ] Outwardly visible signs of TN can sometimes be seen in males who may deliberately miss an area of their face when shaving, in order to avoid triggering an episode. Successive recurrences are incapacitating and the dread of provoking an attack may make sufferers unable to engage in normal daily activities. Some patients report continuous pain or continuous pain during waking hours; for reasons that are not yet known, TN sufferers rarely have pain attacks or are awakened due to pain while they are sleeping. In fact, most patients have a very brief window of reprieve upon awakening from sleep, though that window can sometimes last only minutes. The mechanisms as to why one feels no pain while they are asleep, or in a slumber state, even though a pillow may be in contact with a &quot; trigger point &quot; on one&apos;s face, remains a mystery to physicians and dentists. There is also a variant of TN called atypical trigeminal neuralgia (also referred to as &quot; trigeminal neuralgia, type 2 &quot; ), [ http://www.ohsu.edu/facialpain/facial_pain-dx.shtml Neurological surgery: facial pain Oregon Health &amp; Science University 2011-08-01 ] based on a recent classification of facial pain.

In other cases, the pain is stabbing and intense but may feel like burning or prickling, rather than a shock. Sometimes the pain is a combination of shock-like sensations, migraine -like pain and burning or prickling pain. It can also manifest as an unrelenting, boring, piercing pain. [ Causes ] The trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve responsible for sensory data such as tactition (pressure), thermoception (temperature), and nociception (pain) originating from the face above the jawline; it is also responsible for the motor function of the muscles of mastication, the muscles involved in chewing but not facial expression. Several theories exist to explain the possible causes of this pain syndrome. It was once believed that the nerve was compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but newer leading research indicates that it is an enlarged blood vessel - possibly the superior cerebellar artery - compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the pons. Such a compression can injure the nerve&apos;s protective myelin sheath and cause erratic and hyperactive functioning of the nerve. This can lead to pain attacks at the slightest stimulation of any area served by the nerve as well as hinder the nerve&apos;s ability to shut off the pain signals after the stimulation ends. This type of injury may rarely be caused by an aneurysm (an outpouching of a blood vessel ); by a tumor; by an arachnoid cyst in the cerebellopontine angle; [ Babu R, Murali R Arachnoid cyst of the cerebellopontine angle manifesting as contralateral trigeminal neuralgia: case report Neurosurgery 28 6 886–7 1991 2067614 10.1097/00006123-199106000-00018 ] or by a traumatic event such as a car accident or even a tongue piercing. [ http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061017.wtongues1017/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth/home Tongue piercing brings on &quot; suicide disease &quot; The Globe and Mail Toronto ] [ May 2011 RjwilmsiBot ] Short-term peripheral compression is often painless, with pain attacks lasting no more than a few seconds. Persistent compression results in local demyelination with no loss of axon potential continuity. Chronic nerve entrapment results in demyelination primarily, with progressive axonal degeneration subsequently. It is, &quot; therefore widely accepted that trigeminal neuralgia is associated with demyelination of axons in the gasserion ganglion, the dorsal root, or both. &quot; [ Okeson JP Bell&apos;s orofacial pains: the clinical management of orofacial pain 2005 Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc 0-86715-439-X 115 http://www.quintpub.com/display_detail.php3?psku%3DB439X Lindsay Harmon 6 ] It has been suggested that this compression may be related to an aberrant branch of the superior cerebellar artery that lies on the trigeminal nerve. Further causes, besides an aneurysm, multiple sclerosis or cerebellopontine angle tumor, include: a posterior fossa tumor, any other expanding lesion or even brainstem diseases from strokes. A large portion of multiple sclerosis patients have TN, but is not a symptom of MS. Only two to four percent of patients with TN, [ July 2009 ] usually younger, [ July 2009 ] have evidence of multiple sclerosis, which may damage either the trigeminal nerve or other related parts of the brain. It has been theorized that this is due to damage to the spinal trigeminal complex. [ Cruccu G Trigeminal neuralgia and pain related to multiple sclerosis Pain 143 3 186–91 2009 19171430 10.1016/j.pain.2008.12.026 http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304-3959%2808%2900760-4, Biasiotta A Di Rezze S 3 Fiorelli M Galeotti F Innocenti P Mameli S Millefiorini E Truini A. ] Trigeminal pain has a similar presentation in patients with and without MS.

When there is no [apparent] structural cause, the syndrome is called idiopathic. [ Management ] As with many conditions without clear physical or laboratory diagnosis, TN is unfortunately sometimes misdiagnosed. A TN sufferer will sometimes seek the help of numerous clinicians before a firm diagnosis is made. There is evidence that points towards the need to quickly treat and diagnose TN. It is thought that the longer a patient suffers from TN, the harder it may be to reverse the neural pathways associated with the pain. The dentist must ensure a correct diagnosis does not mistake TN as a temporomandibular disorder. [ Drangsholt M Truelove EL Trigeminal neuralgia mistaken as temporomandibular disorder J Evid Base Dent Pract 2001 1 1 41–50 10.1067/med.2001.116846 http://www.jebdp.com/article/S1532-3382%2801%2970082-6/abstract ] Since triggering may be caused by movements of the tongue or facial muscles, TN must be differentiated from masticatory pain that has the clinical characteristics of deep somatic rather than neuropathic pain. Masticatory pain will not be arrested by a conventional mandibular local anesthetic block. Dentists who suspect TN should proceed in the most conservative manner possible and should ensure that all tooth structures are &quot; truly &quot; compromised before performing extractions or other procedures.

Uncontrolled trials have suggested that clonazepam and lidocaine may be effective. Low doses of some antidepressant s such as amitriptyline are thought to be effective in treating neuropathic pain, but a tremendous amount of controversy exists on this topic, and their use is often limited to treating the depression that is associated with chronic pain, rather than the actual sensation of pain from the trigeminal nerve. Antidepressants are also used to counteract a medication side effect. Duloxetine can also be used in some cases of neuropathic pain, and as it is also an antidepressant can be particularly helpful where neuropathic pain and depression are combined. Opiates such as morphine and oxycodone can be prescribed, and there is evidence of their effectiveness on neuropathic pain, especially if combined with gabapentin. http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200611/000020061106A0262339.php http://www.ukmicentral.nhs.uk/headline/database/story.asp?offset=200 &amp; NewsID=4098 [ Surgical ] The evidence for surgical therapy is poor [ Zakrzewska JM Akram, H Neurosurgical interventions for the treatment of classical trigeminal neuralgia.

Some have excellent success rates using a cost-effective percutaneous surgical procedure known as balloon compression have been reported. [ Natarajan M Percutaneous trigeminal ganglion balloon compression: experience in 40 patients Neurology (Neurological Society of India) 2000 48 4 330–2 11146595 ] This technique has been helpful in treating the elderly for whom surgery may not be an option due to coexisting health conditions. Balloon compression is also the best choice for patients who have ophthalmic nerve pain or have experienced recurrent pain after microvascular decompression. Glycerol injections involve injecting an alcohol-like substance into the cavern that bathes the nerve near its junction. This liquid is corrosive to the nerve fibers and can mildly injure the nerve enough to hinder the errant pain signals. In a radiofrequency rhizotomy, the surgeon uses an electrode to heat the selected division or divisions of the nerve. Done well, this procedure can target the exact regions of the errant pain triggers and disable them with minimal numbness.
