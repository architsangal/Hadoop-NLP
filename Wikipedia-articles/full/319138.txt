[ yes ] { Brie de Meaux, } { Appellation d&apos;origine contrôlée (AOC) } The French paradox is the observation that French people suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease, despite having a diet relatively rich in saturated fat s. [ Ferrieres, J. 2004 http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/90/1/107 The French Paradox; Lessons for other countries Heart 90 107–111 10.1136/heart.90.1.107 14676260 1 1768013 ] The term French paradox was coined by Serge Renaud, a scientist from Bordeaux University in France. [ Serge Renaud: from French paradox to Cretan miracle The Lancet 355 9197 48 B. Simini 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71990-5 2000 10615898 ] When a description of this paradox was aired in the United States on 60 Minutes in 1991 with the speculation that red wine decreases the incidence of cardiac diseases, the consumption of red wine increased 44% and some wineries began lobbying for the right to label their products &quot; health food. &quot; { Drink Like the French, Die Like the French, marininstitute.org } The authors of a review of dietary studies concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease risk, [ http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/169/7/659 A Systematic Review of the Evidence Supporting a Causal Link Between Dietary Factors and Coronary Heart Disease Andrew Mente; Lawrence de Koning; Harry S.

Anand Arch Intern Med 2009 169 7 659–669 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.38 19364995 ] and statistics collected by the World Health Organization from 1990–2000 show that the incidence of heart disease in France may have been underestimated, and may in fact be similar to that of neighboring countries. [ Overview ] { cheese } According to FAO data, { FAOSTAT } [ March 2010 ] the average French person consumed 108  grams per day of fat from animal sources in 2002 while the average American consumed only 72. The French eat four times as much butter, 60 percent more cheese and nearly three times as much pork. Although the French consume only slightly more total fat (171 g/d vs 157 g/d), they consume much more saturated fat because Americans consume a much larger proportion of fat in the form of vegetable oil, with most of that being soybean oil. { FAOSTAT } [ March 2010 ] However, according to data from the British Heart Foundation, { Tab 3.5 RSD web08: Age-standardised rate of finished consultant episodes for operations for CHD by sex and local authority, all ages and under 75 years, 2001/06, England (Table) } [ March 2010 ] in 1999, rates of death from coronary heart disease among males aged 35–74 years were 115 per 100,000 people in the U.S. but only 83 per 100,000 in France. [ Wine ] It has been suggested that France&apos;s high red wine consumption is a primary factor in the trend. This hypothesis was expounded in a 60 Minutes broadcast in 1991. The program catalysed a large increase in North American demand for red wines from around the world. It is believed that one of the components of red wine potentially related to this effect is resveratrol; { Potentially Universal Mechanism Of Aging Identified, ScienceDaily, Nov. 27, 2008 } However, the authors of a 2003 study concluded that the amount of resveratrol absorbed by drinkers of red wine is small enough that it is unlikely to explain the paradox. [ 10.1016/S0009-9120(02)00397-1 Absorption of three wine-related polyphenols in three different matrices by healthy subjects 2003 Goldberg David M. Yan Joseph Soleas George J. Clinical Biochemistry 36 79–87 12554065 1 ] [ Alcohol in wine ] [ Alcohol and cardiovascular disease ] Research suggests that moderate drinkers are less likely to suffer heart attack s than are abstainers or heavy drinkers (see alcohol and cardiovascular disease for details). Therefore, the alcohol in wine might be a factor in the French paradox. However, the difference between U.S. annual per capita alcohol consumption (8.6 litres per year) { WHO Core Health Indicators: United States of America } and French consumption (11.4 litres per year) is only 2.8 litres per year more. { WHO Core Health Indicators: France } Alcohol consumption in France is lower than in Luxembourg (15.6 litres), the Czech Republic (13.0 litres), Hungary (13.6 litres), Germany (12.0 litres), and Croatia (12.3 litres) where no similar paradoxes are observed. There is a lack of medical consensus about whether moderate consumption of beer, wine, or distilled spirits has a stronger association with longevity. Of ten major studies, three found stronger evidence for wine, three for beer, three for liquor, and one study found no difference between alcoholic beverages. [ Edell D. Eat, Drink and be Merry: America’s Doctor Tells You Why the Health Experts are Wrong HarperCollins 1999 191–192 0-06-019155-4 ] [ Resveratrol ] [ Resveratrol ] Wines, particularly red wines, are a source of low levels of resveratrol. High doses of resveratrol have been linked to longevity and cancer prevention in other species. { &quot; Scientists Identify a Potentially Universal Mechanism of Aging &quot; } In 2008, a study found that high doses of resveratrol (a constituent of red wine) mimicked some of the benefits of caloric restriction (including reduced effects of aging) in mice. [ Barger JL, Kayo T, Vann JM, Arias EB, Wang J, et al. 2008 A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice 3 6 e2264 10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 PLoS ONE 18523577 2386967 Tomé Daniel ] [ Procyanidins and polyphenols ] Although research continues on resveratrol, the concentration in wine seems too low to account for the French paradox. Professor Roger Corder and team have identified a particular group of polyphenols, known as oligomeric procyanidins, which they believe offer the greatest degree of protection to human blood-vessel cells. Tests with 165 wines showed that these are found in greatest concentration in European red wines from certain areas, which correlates with longevity in those regions. [ 10.1038/444566a Oenology: Red wine procyanidins and vascular health 2006 Corder R. Mullen W. Khan N. Q. Marks S. C. Wood E. G. Carrier M. J. Crozier A. Nature 444 7119 566 17136085 ] The highest procyanidins are found in wines from the Tannat grape, grown in the Gers area of southwest France. [ March 2012 ] Unlike resveratrol, procyanidins are present in wine in quantities that seem to be high enough to be significant: &quot; Procyanidins are the most abundant flavonoid polyphenols in red wine – up to one gram per litre is found in some traditional style red wines. &quot; { Real Link Between Drinking Red Wine and Increased Longevity – Food and Health } &quot; … clinical trials of grape seed extract, which have shown that 200–300 mg per day will lower blood pressure. Two small glasses (125 ml glass) of a procyanidin-rich red wine, such as a Madiran wine from southwest France, would provide this amount. &quot; However, more than 200  mg of procyanidin can also be consumed by eating a Red Delicious apple. [ 10917927 2000 Hammerstone JF Lazarus SA Schmitz HH Procyanidin content and variation in some commonly consumed foods 130 8S Suppl 2086S–92S The Journal of nutrition ] Other research suggests that polyphenols in wine reduce the absorption of malondialdehyde, which is implicated in arteriosclerosis, cancer, diabetes and other diseases. { Red wine exercises its benefits before it enters the bloodstream } { The Stomach as a “Bioreactor”: When Red Meat Meets Red Wine } [ French diet comparisons ] In his book, The Fat Fallacy, Will Clower suggests the French paradox may be narrowed down to a few key factors, namely: Good fats versus bad fats — French people get up to 80% of their fat intake from dairy and vegetable sources, including whole milk, cheeses, and whole milk yogurt. Higher quantities of fish (at least three times a week). Smaller portions, eaten more slowly and divided among courses that let the body begin to digest food already consumed before more food is added. Lower sugar intake — American low-fat and no-fat foods often contain high concentrations of sugar. French diets avoid these products preferring full-fat versions without added sugar. Low incidence of snacks between meals. Avoidance of common American food items, such as soda, deep-fried foods, snack foods, and especially prepared foods which can typically make up a large percentage of the foods found in American grocery stores. Clower tends to downplay the common beliefs that wine consumption and smoking are greatly responsible for the French paradox. The French diet tends to cause Americans to lose weight while visiting even if they are not wine drinkers. While a higher percentage of French people smoke, this is not greatly higher than the U.S. (35% in France vs. 25% in U.S.) and is unlikely to account for the weight difference between countries. Mireille Guiliano, author of the #1 bestseller French Women Don&apos;t Get Fat, { Paperback best sellers, } { The New York Times, April 9, 2006 } agrees that the weight differences are not due to French smoking habits. She points out that the smoking rates for women in France and the U.S. are virtually identical. { Arhive.org } Guiliano explains the key factors to the French woman&apos;s ability to stay slim as: Smaller portion sizes Savoring food to increase the feeling of satisfaction, choosing a small amount of high quality food rather than larger amounts of low quality food Eating 3 meals a day and not snacking Taking in plenty of liquid such as water, herbal tea and soup Sitting down and eating mindfully (no multitasking and eating while standing up, watching TV, or reading) Emphasizing freshness, variety, balance, and, above all, pleasure In the book Cholesterol and The French Paradox, Frank Cooper argues that the French paradox is due to the lack of hydrogenated and trans fats in the French diet. { Cooper, Frank A. Cholesterol and The French Paradox. Lulu.com Publishing, 2009, pp 136–149. } The French diet is based on natural saturated fats such as butter, cheese and cream that the human body finds easy to metabolize, because they are rich in shorter saturated fatty acids ranging from the 4-carbon butyric acid to the 16-carbon palmitic acid. But the American diet includes greater amounts saturated fats made via hydrogenating vegetable oils which include longer 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids. In addition, these hydrogenated fats include small quantities of trans fats which may have associated health risks.

[ Law, M. &amp; Wald, N. 1999 Why heart disease mortality is low in France: the time lag explanation British Medical Journal 318 1471–1480 10.1136/bmj.318.7196.1471 7196 ] Law and Wald (1999) used Criqui and Ringel&apos;s (1994) study of alcohol and diet in explaining the French paradox. On analyzing past and recent data of serum cholesterol and fat consumption (when earlier data were entered and adjustment was made for under-certification of CHD), they found that France fits in with the trend of other countries with similar cholesterol and fat intake. Also, recent data prediction for CHD mortality rates showed that France was similar to other countries. [ Whole diet ] In the book In Defense of Food, Michael Pollan suggests the explanation is not any single nutrient, but the combination of nutrients found in unprocessed food; not any one nutrient, nor the amount of carbohydrates or fats or proteins, but the whole length and breadth of nutrients found in &quot; natural &quot; foods as opposed to &quot; processed &quot; foods. { Pollan, Michael In Defense of Food. Penguin Press, 2008. } [ Validity questioned ] Nevertheless, the medical causes of the French paradox are still not entirely clear and research continues. Meanwhile, some researchers have questioned the validity of this paradox altogether, particularly the connection between natural saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease. This view has recently received broad support through the results of the Nurses&apos; Health Study run by the Women&apos;s Health Initiative. After accumulating approximately 8 years of data on the diet and health of 49,000 post-menopausal American women, the researchers found that the balance of saturated versus unsaturated fats does not affect heart disease risk, while the consumption of trans fat results in significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
