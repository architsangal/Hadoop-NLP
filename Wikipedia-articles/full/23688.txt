[ the 1978 book Perjury: The Hiss–Chambers Case ] [ article USA the United States United Kingdom the United Kingdom July 2010 ] Perjury, also known as forswearing, is the willful act of swearing a false oath or affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to a judicial proceeding. [ Perjury - What is it? Law Advice: White Collar Crimes FreeAdvice 2008-12 http://criminal-law.freeadvice.com/white_collar_crimes/perjury.htm 2009-03-02 ] That is, the witness falsely promises to tell the truth about matters which affect the outcome of the case. For example, it is not considered perjury to lie about one&apos;s age unless age is a factor in determining the legal result, such as eligibility for old age retirement benefits. Perjury is considered a serious offense as it can be used to usurp the power of the courts, resulting in miscarriages of justice. In the United States, for example, the general perjury statute under Federal law classifies perjury as a felony and provides for a prison sentence of up to five years. { See: } [ 18 1621 ] {; } [ 28 1746 ] {. } On the other hand, the California Penal Code allows for perjury to be a capital offense in cases causing wrongful execution. However prosecutions for perjury are rare. [ http://www.criminal-law-lawyer-source.com/terms/perjury.html Perjury Criminal Law Lawyer Source April 8, 2010 ] In some countries such as France and Italy, suspects cannot be heard under oath or affirmation and thus cannot commit perjury, regardless of what they say during their trial. The rules for perjury also apply when a person has made a statement under penalty of perjury, even if the person has not been sworn or affirmed as a witness before an appropriate official. An example of this is the United States&apos; income tax return, which, by law, must be signed as true and correct under penalty of perjury (see [ 26 6065 ] ). Federal tax law provides criminal penalties of up to three years in prison for violation of the tax return perjury statute. See: [ 26 7206 1 ] Statements which entail an interpretation of fact are not perjury because people often draw inaccurate conclusions unwittingly, or make honest mistakes without the intent to deceive. Individuals may have honest but mistaken beliefs about certain facts, or their recollection may be inaccurate, or may have a different perception of what is the accurate way to state the truth. Like most other crimes in the common law system, to be convicted of perjury one must have had the intention ( mens rea ) to commit the act, and to have actually committed the act ( actus reus ). Further, statements that are facts cannot be considered perjury, even if they might arguably constitute an omission, and it is not perjury to lie about matters immaterial to the legal proceeding. Subornation of perjury, attempting to induce another person to perjure themselves, is itself a crime. [ Nigeria ] See Perjury in Nigeria. [ Republic of Ireland ] A person who before the Court of Justice of the European Communities swears anything which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true is, whatever his nationality, guilty of perjury. { The } { Court of Justice of the European Communities (Perjury) Act 1975, section 1 } Proceedings for this offence may be taken in any place in the State and the offence may for all incidental purposes be treated as having been committed in that place. { The } { Court of Justice of the European Communities (Perjury) Act 1975, section 2 } [ United Kingdom ] [ England and Wales ] Perjury is a statutory offence in England and Wales. It is created by section 1(1) of the Perjury Act 1911. Section 1 of that Act reads: [ (1) If any person lawfully sworn as a witness or as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding wilfully makes a statement material in that proceeding, which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true, he shall be guilty of perjury, and shall, on conviction thereof on indictment, be liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding seven years, or to imprisonment... for a term not exceeding two years, or to a fine or to both such penal servitude or imprisonment and fine. (2) The expression &quot; judicial proceeding &quot; includes a proceeding before any court, tribunal, or person having by law power to hear, receive, and examine evidence on oath. (3) Where a statement made for the purposes of a judicial proceeding is not made before the tribunal itself, but is made on oath before a person authorised by law to administer an oath to the person who makes the statement, and to record or authenticate the statement, it shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as having been made in a judicial proceeding. (4) A statement made by a person lawfully sworn in England for the purposes of a judicial proceeding- :(a) in another part of His Majesty’s dominions; or :(b) in a British tribunal lawfully constituted in any place by sea or land outside His Majesty’s dominions; or :(c) in a tribunal of any foreign state, shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a statement made in a judicial proceeding in England. (5) Where, for the purposes of a judicial proceeding in England, a person is lawfully sworn under the authority of an Act of Parliament- :(a) in any other part of His Majesty’s dominions; or :(b) before a British tribunal or a British officer in a foreign country, or within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England; a statement made by such person so sworn as aforesaid (unless the Act of Parliament under which it was made otherwise specifically provides) shall be treated for the purposes of this section as having been made in the judicial proceeding in England for the purposes whereof it was made. (6) The question whether a statement on which perjury is assigned was material is a question of law to be determined by the court of trial. Digital copy of section 1 from Legislation.gov.uk ] The words omitted from section 1(1) were repealed by section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948. A person guilty of an offence under section 11(1) of the European Communities Act 1972 may be proceeded against and punished in England and Wales as for an offence under section 1(1). { The } { European Communities Act 1972, section 11(1)(a) } Section 1(4) has effect in relation to proceedings in the Court of Justice of the European Communities as it has effect in relation to a judicial proceeding in a tribunal of a foreign state. { The } { Evidence (European Court) Order 1976 (S.I. 1976/428), article 3, as read with article 2 } Section 1(4) applies in relation to proceedings before a relevant convention court under the European Patent Convention as it applies to a judicial proceeding in a tribunal of a foreign state. { The } { Patents Act 1977, section 92(5) } A statement made on oath by a witness outside the United Kingdom and given in evidence through a live television link by virtue of section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 must be treated for the purposes of section 1 as having been made in the proceedings in which it is given in evidence. { The } { Criminal Justice Act 1988, section 32(3) } Section 1 applies in relation to a person acting as an intermediary as it applies in relation to a person lawfully sworn as an interpreter in a judicial proceeding; and for this purpose, where a person acts as an intermediary in any proceeding which is not a judicial proceeding for the purposes of section 1, that proceeding must be taken to be part of the judicial proceeding in which the witness’s evidence is given. { The } { Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, section 29(7) } Where any statement made by a person on oath in any proceeding which is not a judicial proceeding for the purposes of section 1 is received in evidence in pursuance of a special measures direction, that proceeding must be taken for the purposes of section 1 to be part of the judicial proceeding in which the statement is so received in evidence. { The } { Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, section 31(6) } Judicial proceeding The definition in section 1(2) is not &quot; comprehensive &quot;. { Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice. 1999. Paragraph 28-159 at page 2303. } The book &quot; Archbold &quot; said that it appears to be immaterial whether the court, before which the statement is made, has jurisdiction in the particular cause in which the statement is made, because there is no express requirement in the Act that the court be one of &quot; competent jurisdiction &quot; and because the definition in section 1(2) does not appear to require this by implication either. { Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice. 1999.

[ History ] In Anglo-Saxon legal procedure, the offence of perjury could only be committed by both jurors and by compurgator s. { Turner, J.W.C: Kenny Outlines on Criminal Law (Cambridge at University, Press: London, 1964) (18th edition), p.421. } With time witnesses began to appear in court they were not so treated despite the fact that their functions were akin to that of modern witnesses. This was due to the fact that their role were not yet differentiated from those of the juror – hence false evidence or perjury by witnesses was not made a crime. Even in the fourteenth century when witnesses started appearing before the jury to testify, perjury by them was not made a punishable offence. The maxim then was that every witness’s evidence on oath was true. Perjury by witnesses began to be punished before the end of fifteen century by the Star Chamber. The immunity enjoyed by witnesses began also to be whittled down or interfered with by the parliament in England in 1540 with subornation of perjury and, in 1562, with perjury proper. The punishment for the offence then was in the nature of monetary penalty, recoverable in a civil action and, not by penal sanction. In 1613, the Star Chamber, declared perjury by a witness to be a punishable offence at common law. See section 3 of the Maintenance and Embracery Act 1540, the 5 Eliz 1 c 9 (An Act for the Punyshement of suche persones as shall procure or comit any wyllful Perjurye) and the Perjury Act 1728. Materiality The requirement that the statement be material can be traced back to, { Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice. 1999. Paragraph 28-160 at page 2303. They cite 3 Inst 167. } and has been credited to, { Smith, J.C, and Hogan, Brian. Criminal Law. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1965. Second Edition. Page 506. } Coke. He said: [ For if it be not material, then though it be false, yet it is no perjury, because it concerneth not the point in suit, and therefore in effect it is extra-judicial. Also this act giveth remedy to the party grieved, and if the deposition be not material, he cannot be grieved thereby. 3 Inst 167. This passage is quoted by Smith, J.C, and Hogan, Brian, Criminal Law (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1965) (2nd Edition), p. 506. ] [ Northern Ireland ] Perjury is a statutory offence in Northern Ireland. It is created by article 3(1) of the Perjury (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 (S.I. 1979/1714 (N.I. 19)). This replaces the Perjury Act (Northern Ireland) 1946 (c. 13) (N.I.). [ United States of America ] Perjury operates in American Law as an inherited principle of the common law of England, which defined the act as the &quot; willful and corrupt giving, upon a lawful oath, or in any form allowed by law to be substituted for an oath, in a judicial proceeding or course of justice, of a false testimony material to the issue or matter of inquiry. &quot; [ Clark William Hand-Book of Criminal Law 1894 West Publishing Company ] William Blackstone touched on the subject in his Commentaries on the Laws of England, establishing perjury as &quot; a crime committed when a lawful oath is administered, in some judicial proceeding, to a person who swears willfully, absolutely, and falsely, in a matter material to the issue or point in question. &quot; [ Blackstone William Commentaries on the Law of England 1765 ] The punishment for perjury under the common law has varied from death to banishment and has included such grotesque penalties as severing the tongue of the perjurer. [ Doyle Charles Perjury Under Federal Law: A Brief Overview Congressional Research Service 2010 ] The definitional structure of perjury provides an important framework for legal proceedings, as the component parts of this definition have permeated jurisdictional lines, finding a home in American legal constructs. As such, the main tenets of perjury, including mens rea, a lawful oath, occurring during a judicial proceeding, a false testimony have remained necessary pieces of perjury’s definition in the United States. [ Livingston Edward A System of Penal Law for the United States of America 1828 ] Perjury’s current position in America’s legal takes the form of state and federal statutes. Most notably, the United States Code prohibits perjury, which is defined in two senses for federal purposes as someone who: [ United States Code, Title 18, Part 1, Section 1621 ] The above statute provides for a fine and/or up to five years in prison as punishment. Within federal jurisdiction, statements made in two broad categories of judicial proceedings may qualify as perjurious: 1) Federal official proceedings, and 2) Federal Court or Grand Jury proceedings. A third type of perjury entails the procurement of perjurious statements from another person. [ Doyle Charles Perjury Under Federal Law: A Brief Overview Congressional Research Service 2010 ] More generally, the statement must occur in the &quot; course of justice, &quot; but this definition leaves room open for interpretation. [ cLARK William Hand-Book of Criminal Law 1894 West Publishing Co. ] One particularly precarious aspect of this phrasing is that it entails knowledge of the accused person’s perception of the truthful nature of events and not necessarily the actual truth of those events. It is important to note the distinction here, between giving a false statement under oath and merely misstating a fact accidentally, though this distinction can be especially difficult to discern in court of law. [ Shuy Roger he Language of Perjury Cases 2011 Oxford University Press ] The development of perjury law in the United States centers on United States v. Dunnigan, a seminal case that set out the parameters of perjury within United States law. The court uses the Dunnigan based legal standard to determine if an accused person, &quot; [T]estifying under oath or affirmation violates this section if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. &quot; [ United States v. Dunnigan 507 U.S. 87 (1993) ] However, a defendant shown to be willfully ignorant may in fact be eligible for perjury prosecution. [ United States v. Fawley (1998) ] The Dunnigan distinction manifests its importance in with regard to the relation between two component parts of perjury’s definition: in willfully giving a false statement, a person must understand that she is giving a false statement to be considered a perjurer under the Dunnigan framework. Deliberation on the part of the defendant is required for a statement to constitute perjury. [ cLARK William Hand-Book of Criminal Law 1894 West Publishing Co. ] Jurisprudential developments in the American law of perjury have revolved around the facilitation of &quot; perjury prosecutions and thereby enhance the reliability of testimony before federal courts and grand juries. &quot; [ Dunn v. United States 480 U.S. 294 (1987) ] With this goal in mind, congress has sometimes expanded the grounds on which an individual may be prosecuted for perjury, with section 1623 of the United States Code recognizing the utterance of two mutually incompatible statements as grounds for perjury indictment even if neither can unequivocally be proven false. [ United States Code, Title 18, Part 1, Section 1623 (c) ] However, the two statements must be so mutually incompatible that at least one must necessarily be false; it is irrelevant whether the false statement can be specifically identified from among the two. [ United States v. McAfee 971 F.2d 755 (1992) ] It thus falls on the government to show that a defendant (a) knowingly made a (b) false (c) material statement (d) under oath (e) in a legal proceeding. [ United States v. Gorman ] These proceedings can be ancillary to normal court proceedings, and thus, even such menial interactions as bail hearings can qualify as protected proceedings under this statute. [ United States v. Greene 355 U.S. 184 (1957) ] Perjury law’s evolution in the United States has experience the most debate with regards to the materiality requirement. Fundamentally, statements that are literally true cannot provide the basis for a perjury charge [ Bronston v. United States 409 U.S. 352 (1973) ] (as they do not meet the falsehood requirement) just as answers to truly ambiguous statements cannot constitute perjury. [ United States v. Richardson 418 U.S. 166 (1974) ] However, such fundamental truths of perjury law become muddled when discerning the materiality of a given statement and the way in which it was material to the given case. In United States v. Brown, the court defined material statements as those with &quot; a natural tendency to influence, or is capable of influencing, the decision of the decision-making body to be addressed, &quot; such as a jury or grand jury. [ United States v. Brown 381 U.S. 437 (1965) ] While courts have specifically made clear certain instances which have succeeded or failed to meet the nebulous threshold for materiality, the topic remains unresolved in large part, except in certain legal areas where intent manifests itself in an abundantly clear fashion, such as with the so-called perjury trap, a specific situation in which a prosecutor calls a person to testify before a grand jury with the intent of drawing a perjurious statement from the person being questioned. [ Gershman Bennett The &quot; Perjury Trap &quot; Pace Law Faculty Publications 1981 ] One significant legal distinction lies in the specific realm of knowledge necessarily possessed by a defendant for her statements to be properly called perjury. Though the defendant must knowingly render a false statement in a legal proceeding or under federal jurisdiction, the defendant need not know that they are speaking under such conditions for the statement to constitute perjury. [ United States v. Yermian 468 U.S. 63 (1984) ] All tenets of perjury qualification persist- the “knowingly” aspect of telling the false statement simply does not apply to the defendant’s knowledge about the person she intends to deceive. Despite a tendency of American perjury law toward broad prosecutory power under perjury statutes, American perjury law has afforded potential defendants a new form of defense not found in the British Common Law. This defense requires that an individual admit to making a perjuious statement during that same proceeding and recanting the statement. [ United States Code, Title 18, Part 1, Section 1623 (d) ] Though this defensive loophole slightly narrows the types of cases which may be prosecuted for perjury, the effect of this statutory defense is to promote a truthful retelling of facts by witnesses, thus helping to ensure the reliability of American court proceedings just as broadened perjury statutes aimed to do. Subornation of Perjury Subornation of perjury stands as a subset of American perjury laws and prohibits an individual from inducing another to commit perjury. [ United States Code, Title 18, Part 1, Section 1622 ] Subornation of perjury entails equivalent possible punishments as perjury on the federal level. This crime requires an extra level of satisfactory proof, as prosecutors must show not only that perjury occurred, but also that the defendant positively induced said perjury. Furthermore, the inducing defendant must know that the suborned statement is a false, perjurious statement. [ Rosen v.
