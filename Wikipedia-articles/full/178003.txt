The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Kvalsund. Kvalsund was separated from the municipality of Sørøysund on 1 July 1869. The Kvalsund Bridge (Kvalsundbrua) is a suspension bridge that crosses Kvalsundet from the mainland to the island of Kvaløya. Since 2011, the mayor of Kvalsund is Ragnar Olsen, who represents the Labour Party. [ General information ] [ Name ] The Old Norse form of the name was Hvalsund. The first element is hvalr which means &quot; whale &quot; and the last element is sund which means &quot; strait &quot; or &quot; sound &quot;. The Sámi name also translates to Whale (fáles) Strait (nuorri). [ Coat-of-arms ] The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 27 March 1987. The arms show three silver-colored salmon arranged in a pall on a blue background. The salmon represents fishing in various forms: as a traditional way of living and source of income, as modern fish farming, and as a recreational activity.

[ Settlements ] The main village is also called Kvalsund, but was earlier called Finnbyen - a name meaning simply &quot; Coast Sámi settlement &quot;. The Sámi name is Ráhkkerávju, which is untranslatable. Other villages in the municipality include Skáidi ( &quot; rivers&apos; meeting-place &quot; in Sámi), Stállugárgu ( &quot; troll beach &quot;, commonly written Stallogargo in Norwegian), Næverfjord old writing and pronounced (dialect), written form today Neverfjord (bokmål) - the Sámi name of which is Návvuotna - and Kokelv (Sámi: Guoikejohka). Regarding the latter toponyms, the Næverfjord translates to &quot; tinder fiord &quot; and Návvuotna to &quot; cowshed fiord &quot;; while Kokelv is &quot; boiling river &quot; in Norwegian and Guiokejohka means &quot; rushing river &quot; in Sámi. Lakes in the region include Bjørnstadvatnet. [ Culture ] { Roland Bonaparte in 1884 } [ Aboriginal culture ] Until a few hundred years ago, Coast Sámi culture was completely dominant in Kvalsund. Norwegian and Kven immigration soon made the area multicultural. During Norwegianization much of the traditional culture was lost. Kokelv is the village that has most successfully preserved elements of Sámi culture, and today has a Coast Sámi museum. The gakti of the Kvalsund region is easily recognizable by dots and jags on the collars (for men) and sleeves (for women). [ Fægstock ] The municipality hosts an annual rock festival known as Fægstock, which takes place in Fægfjord (Sámi: Veaigesvuotna, &quot; twilight fiord &quot; ). [ Nature ] [ Birdlife ] 200px The municipality of Kvalsund has several localities that have a rich and varied bird fauna. One of these is Repparfjordbotn with its large colony of Arctic Tern s and its autumn numbers of Goosander.
