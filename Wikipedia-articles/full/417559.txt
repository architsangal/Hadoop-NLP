In The Apprentice (2009), Sugar revealed &quot; I was in the Jewish Lads Brigade, Stamford Hill Division, Trainee Bugler, but it didn&apos;t make me sell computers! &quot; After leaving school at 16, he worked briefly for the civil service as a statistician at the Ministry of Education. He started selling car aerials and electrical goods out of a van he had bought with his savings of £100. [ Personal life ] Sugar met his wife Ann (née Simons) when he was 17. They married on 28 April 1968; they have two sons and a daughter. Sugar and his wife live in Chigwell, Essex.

He is a fan of and the former owner of Tottenham Hotspur. In February 2009, it was reported that Sugar had initiated legal proceedings against The Sun newspaper following a report that he had been named on a &quot; hit list &quot; of British Jews in response to Israel&apos;s ongoing military operation in Gaza. The threats are alleged to have been made by Glen Jenvey, the source of the original story in The Sun, who posted to a Muslim website under a false identity. [ Political involvement ] In February 2009, the Evening Standard journalist Andrew Gilligan claimed that Sugar had been approached to be the Labour candidate for Mayor of London in 2012. Sugar subsequently ridiculed the claim in an interview with The Guardian. But, during Prime Minister Gordon Brown &apos;s cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009, the BBC reported that Sugar would become Lord Sugar and had been offered a job as the government&apos;s &quot; Enterprise Champion &quot;. On 7 June 2009 Sugar sought to clarify the non-political nature of his appointment. He stated that he would not be joining the government, that the appointment was politically neutral, and that all he wanted to do was help businesses and entrepreneurs. { Sugar: I&apos;m not joining government www.bbc.co.uk } [ Ventures ] [ Amstrad ] [ Amstrad ] Sugar founded Amstrad in 1968, the name being an acronym of his initials – A&apos;lan Michael Sugar Trad&apos;ing. Despite this acronym, Sugar also trades under other business names, see below. The company began as a general importer/exporter and wholesaler, but soon specialised in consumer electronics. By 1970, the first manufacturing venture was underway. He achieved lower production prices by using injection moulding plastics for hi-fi turntable covers, severely undercutting competitors who used vacuum-forming processes. Manufacturing capacity was soon expanded to include the production of audio amplifiers and tuners. Amstrad&apos;s CPC 464 Computer In 1980, Amstrad was listed on the London Stock Exchange and during the 1980s, Amstrad doubled its profit and market value every year. [ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/the-big-question-the-apprentice-is-a-hit--but-how-good-a-businessman-is-sir-alan-sugar-477500.html The Big Question: &apos;The Apprentice&apos; is a hit – but how good a businessman is Sir Alan Sugar? Sean O&apos;Grady The Independent 10 May 2006 21 January 2011 ] By 1984, recognising the opportunity of the home computer era, Amstrad launched an 8-bit machine Amstrad CPC 464. Although the CPC range were attractive machines, with CP/M -capability and a good BASIC interpreter, it had to compete with its arch-rivals, the more graphically complex Commodore 64 and the popular Sinclair ZX Spectrum, not to mention the highly sophisticated BBC Micro. Despite this, three million units were sold worldwide with a long production life of eight years. It inspired an East German version with Russian Z80 clone processors. In 1985, Sugar had another major breakthrough with the launch of the Amstrad PCW 8256 word processor which, although made of cheap components, retailed at over £300. In 1986 Amstrad bought the rights to the Sinclair computer product line and produced two more ZX Spectrum models in a similar style to their CPC machines. It also developed the PC1512, a PC compatible computer, which became quite popular in Europe and was the first in a line of Amstrad PCs. At its peak, Amstrad achieved a stock market value of £1.2 billion, but the 1990s proved a difficult time for the company. The launch of a range of business PCs was marred by unreliable hard disks (supplied by Seagate ), which occasioned a high level of customer dissatisfaction and damage to Amstrad&apos;s reputation in the personal computer market, from which it never recovered. Subsequently, Amstrad sued Seagate for $100 million for lost revenue. In the early 1990s, Amstrad began to focus on portable computers rather than desktop computers. Also, in 1990, Amstrad entered the gaming market with the Amstrad GX4000, but it was a commercial failure, largely because there was only a poor selection of games available on it. Additionally, it was immediately superseded by the Japanese consoles: Mega Drive and Super Nintendo, which both had a much more comprehensive selection of games. In 1993, Amstrad released the PenPad, a PDA, and bought into Betacom and Viglen, so as to focus more on telecommunications rather than computers. Amstrad released the first of its combined telephony and e-mail devices, called the e-m@iler, followed by the e-m@ilerplus in 2002, neither of which is sold extensively. [ Amstrad dumps e-m@iler phone VNUnet http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2142725/amstrad-dumps-iler-phone 10 June 2007 10 June 2007 ] On 31 July 2007 it was announced that broadcaster BSkyB had agreed to buy Amstrad for about £125m. At the time of the takeover, Sugar commented that he wished to play a part in the business, saying: &quot; I turn 60 this year and I have had 40 years of hustling in the business, but now I have to start thinking about my team of loyal staff, many of whom have been with me for many years. &quot; On 2 July 2008 it was announced that Sugar was standing down from Amstrad as chairman, to focus solely on his other business interests. [ Tottenham Hotspur ] [ Tottenham Hotspur F.C. ] After a take-over battle with Robert Maxwell, Sugar teamed up with Terry Venables and bought Tottenham Hotspur football club in June 1991. Although Sugar&apos;s initial investment helped ease the financial troubles the club was suffering at the time, his treatment of Tottenham as a business venture and not a footballing one made him an unpopular figure among the Spurs fans. In Sugar&apos;s nine years as chairman, Tottenham Hotspur did not finish in the top six in the league and won just one trophy, the 1999 Football League Cup. Sugar sacked Venables the night before the 1993 FA Cup Final, a decision which led to Venables appealing to the high courts for reinstatement. A legal battle for the club took place over the summer, which Sugar won (see Re Tottenham Hotspur plc [1994] 1 BCLC 655). The decision to sack Venables angered many of Tottenham fans, and Sugar later said, &quot; I felt as though I&apos;d killed Bambi. &quot; In 1992 he was the only representative of the then big five ( Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham) who voted in favour of SKY &apos;s bid for Premier League television rights. The other four voted in favour of ITV &apos;s bid, as it had promised to show big fives games more often. At the time of the vote, Sugar&apos;s company Amstrad was developing satellite dishes for SKY. In 1994 Sugar financed the transfers of three stars of the 1994 World Cup : Ilie Dumitrescu, Gica Popescu, and most notably Jürgen Klinsmann, who had an excellent first season in English football, being named Footballer of the Year. Because Spurs had not qualified for the UEFA Cup, Klinsmann decided to invoke an opt-out clause in his contract and left for Bayern Munich in the summer of 1995. Sugar appeared on television holding the last shirt Klinsmann wore for Spurs and said he wouldn&apos;t wash his car with it. He called foreigners coming into the Premier League at high wages as &quot; Carlos Kickaballs &quot;. Klinsmann retaliated by calling Sugar &quot; a man without honour &quot;, and said: &quot; He only ever talks about money. He never talks about the game. I would say there is a big question mark over whether Sugar&apos;s heart is in the club and in football. The big question is what he likes more, the business or the football? &quot; Klinsmann re-signed for Tottenham on loan in December 1997. In October 1998, former Tottenham striker Teddy Sheringham released his autobiography, in which he attacked Sugar as the reason he left Tottenham in 1997. Sheringham said Sugar had accused him of feigning injury during a long spell on the sidelines during the 1993/1994 season. He wrote that Sugar had refused to give him the five-year contract he wanted, as he had not believed Sheringham would still get into the Tottenham team when he was 36. Sheringham returned to Tottenham after his spell at Manchester United and continued to start for the first team until he was released in the summer of 2003, at age 37. Sheringham said that Sugar lacked ambition and was hypocritical. As an example, Sugar asked him for recommendations of players; when Sheringham suggested England midfielder Paul Ince, Sugar refused because he did not want to spend £4 million on a player who would soon be 30. After Sheringham left Spurs, Sugar approved the signing of Les Ferdinand, aged 31, for a club record £6 million, on higher wages than Sheringham had wanted. { Teddy Sheringham, My Autobiography } Sugar appointed seven managers in his time at Spurs. The first was Peter Shreeves, followed by the dual management team of Doug Livermore and Ray Clemence, former Spurs midfielder Osvaldo Ardiles, and up and coming young manager Gerry Francis. In 1997 Sugar stunned the footballing world by appointing the relatively unknown Swiss manager Christian Gross. Gross lasted 9 months as Spurs finished in 14th place in 1998, and began the next season with just 3 points from their opening three games. Sugar next appointed George Graham, a former player and manager of bitter rivals Arsenal. Despite his earning Tottenham&apos;s first trophy in 8 years, the Spurs fans never warmed to Graham, partly because of his Arsenal connections. They disliked the negative, defensive style of football which he had Spurs playing; fans claimed it was not the &quot; Tottenham way &quot;. In February 2001, Sugar sold his majority stake at Tottenham to leisure group ENIC, selling 27% of the club for £22 million.

Sugar fires a candidate each week until one candidate is left, who is then employed in his company or (since the 2011 series) wins a partnership with Sugar, including his investment of £250,000 to establish their own business. As a condition for appearing in the third series, Sugar placed a requirement that the show be more business-orientated rather than just entertainment and that he should be portrayed in a less harsh light, to counter his somewhat belligerent reputation. He also expressed a desire that the calibre of the candidates should be higher than those who had appeared in the second series (who had come across as manifestly lacklustre) and that the motives of the candidates for participating are scrutinised more carefully, given that certain of the candidates in previous series had used their successful experience in the show as a springboard to advance their own careers (as occurred with Michelle Dewberry, the winner of the second series, who left Amstrad&apos;s employment only 8 months after taking up the job). Sugar has criticised the US version of The Apprentice because &quot; they’ve made the fatal error of trying to change things just for the sake of it and it backfired. &quot; [ Young Apprentice ] [ Young Apprentice ] Young Apprentice (Junior Apprentice in series 1) is a British reality television programme in which a group of twelve young people, aged 16 and 17, compete to win a £25,000 prize from the British business magnate Lord Sugar. The six-part series began on BBC One and BBC HD on Wednesday, 12 May 2010, concluding on Thursday, 10 June of the same year, and also featured Nick Hewer and Karren Brady as Sugar&apos;s advisors. Karren Brady made her debut on Junior Apprentice, because it aired before she appeared on the adult version. The programme concluded with Sugar awarding the prize fund to 17-year-old Arjun Rajyagor and Tim Ankers finished in second place. The second series started in October 2011, and this time featured eight episodes and twelve contestants. The series was won by Zara Brownless, with James McCullough as runner-up. Originally proposed in March 2008 and confirmed in June 2009, Junior Apprentice received mostly positive reviews from critics. The programme is a spin-off from the series The Apprentice, which was in turn spawned from an American series of the same name, which stars the entrepreneur Donald Trump. Sugar&apos;s role under Gordon Brown&apos;s government sparked a debate over the BBC&apos;s political impartiality regulations in the run-up to the UK 2010 election, resulting in both Junior Apprentice and the sixth regular edition of The Apprentice being delayed.

Regarding the 1970s UK law which states that it is discriminatory and hence illegal for women to be asked at interview whether they plan to have children, { Section 6 of the Act determines general illegality of discrimination against women in obtaining employment. } Sugar is quoted as saying, &quot; These laws are counter-productive for women, that&apos;s the bottom line. You&apos;re not allowed to ask, so it&apos;s easy – just don&apos;t employ them.
