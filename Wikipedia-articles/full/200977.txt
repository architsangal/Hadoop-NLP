&quot; Sex object &quot; redirects here. For other uses, see Sex object (disambiguation) Sexual objectification refers to the practice of regarding or treating another person merely as an instrument (object) towards one&apos;s sexual pleasure, and a sex object is a person who is regarded simply as an object of sexual gratification or who is sexually attractive. Objectification more broadly is an attitude that regards a person as a commodity or as an object for use, with little or no regard for a person&apos;s personality or sentience. { LeMoncheck, Linda, Loose Women, Lecherous Men: A Feminist Philosophy of Sex (Oxford University press, 1997), ISBN 978-0-19-510556-8, p. 133 } Objectification is most commonly examined at a societal level, but can also arise at an individual level. The concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of women, is an important idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from feminism. { Barry, Kathleen, Female Sexual Slavery (NYU Press, 1994), ISBN 978-0-8147-1069-2, p.247 } { Goldenberg, Jamie L., and Tomi-Ann Roberts, &apos;The Beast within the Beauty: An Existential Perspective on the Objectification and Condemnation of Women&apos; in Jeff Greenberg, Sander Leon Koole, Thomas A.

Chapters 13–16. } [ Sexual objectification of women ] Feminist scholars say that the objectification of women involves the act of disregarding the personal and intellectual abilities and capabilities of a female; and reducing a woman&apos;s worth or role in society to that of an instrument for the sexual pleasure that she can produce in the mind of another. Although opinions differ as to which situations are objectionable, some feminists see objectification of women taking place in the sexually oriented depictions of women in advertising and media, women being portrayed as weak or submissive through pornography, images in more mainstream media such as advertising and art, stripping and prostitution, men brazenly evaluating or judging women sexually or aesthetically in public spaces, and the presumed need for cosmetic surgery, particularly breast enlargement and labiaplasty. [ April 2008 ] Feminists argue that women have historically been valued mainly for their physical attributes. Some feminists and psychologists argue that such objectification can lead to negative psychological effects including depression and hope lessness, and can give women negative self-image s because of the belief that their intelligence and competence are currently not being, or will never be, acknowledged by society.

Such claims include: girls&apos; understanding of the importance of appearance in society may contribute to feelings of fear, shame, and disgust that some experience during the transition from girlhood to womanhood because they sense that they are becoming more visible to society as sexual objects; { Lee, Janet. 1994. Menarche and the (hetero)sexualization of the female body. Gender &amp; Society 8(3):343–362. } [ 10.1177/089124394008003004 ] and that young women are especially susceptible to objectification, as they are often taught that power, respect, and wealth can be derived from one&apos;s outward appearance.

In the French Enlightenment, for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman&apos;s breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy &apos;s 1771 play The True Mother (La Vraie Mère), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: &quot; Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women? &quot; { Simon Schama. Citizens. A Chronicle of the French Revolution, p. 147. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1989. ISBN 0-394-55948-7. } Recently, sexual-objectification has been reported as a national epidemic. A society filled with people experiencing sexual objectification and self-objectification is considered to have low political efficacy. The minimal self-worth of citizens leads them to doubt themselves in having the ability to understand and influence political affairs. As people lose their political efficacy, they stop having motivation to participate in society, and the result could be a society void of any enthusiasm, intellect, or advancement, or only input from one ruling power.Low political efficacy, or self-worth, also gives rise to sexual violence and its acceptance by society. Dehumanization through objectification has historically been a first step in justifying violence against a specific people. Today, 1 in 6 women are rape survivors, however 27% of women whose sexual assault cases matched the legal definition of rape actually considered themselves rape victims. Statistics like these acceptance of sexual violence by both men and women due to objectification and low self-worth. { [“Campus Sexual Violence.” Health.arizona. Campus Health, n.d.

While some women see such behaviour as a form of empowerment, critics contend that it has led to greater emphasis on a physical criterion or sexualization for women&apos;s perceived self worth, which Levy calls &quot; raunch culture &quot;. { &apos;Save the males&apos;: Ho culture lights fuses, but confuses, By KATHLEEN PARKER, NY Daily News, June 30th 2008.

Levy followed the camera crew from the Girls Gone Wild video series, and argues that contemporary America&apos;s sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves. [ http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article2523264.ece The Times London Yes we are bovvered Ginny Dougary September 25, 2007 May 23, 2010 ] In today&apos;s culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit pornography has become a symbol of feminist strength; she says that she was surprised at how many people, both men and women, working for programs such as Girls Gone Wild told her that this new &quot; raunchy &quot; culture marked not the downfall of feminism but its triumph, because it proved that U.S. women have become strong enough to express their sexuality publicly. [ Sexual objectification of men ] Feminist authors Christina Hoff Sommers and Naomi Wolf write that women&apos;s sexual liberation has led many women to a role reversal, whereby they view men as sex objects, { Sommers, Christina Hoff. 1994. Who Stole Feminism: How Women Have Betrayed Women. New York. Simon and Schuster (pp.264-265), ISBN 0-671-7924-8 (hc), ISBN 0-684-80156-6 (pb) } { Wolf, Naomi. 1994.

February 1994 } in a manner similar to what they criticize men&apos;s treatment of women. Research has suggested that the psychological effects of objectification on men are similar to those of women, leading to negative body image among men. { The Beefcaking of America } Instances where men are being presented as sex objects include advertising, music videos, movies and television shows, { Eating the Eye Candy } { Female Gaze } { Shirtless Scene } { Female Friendly Advertising } beefcake calendars, women&apos;s magazines, male strip shows, and clothed female nude male (CFNM) events. { Sports, Gym Classes, Team Initiations and Events } { Tale of the Dancing Bear } Also, more women are purchasing and consuming pornography. { McElroy, Wendy. 1995.

New York: St. Martin&apos;s Press (p.36) } { 66% of women watch porn } { A &apos;Playgirl &quot; for Adult TV } [ Views on sexual objectification ] [ The gaze ] While the concept of sexual objectification is important within feminist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification and what are the ethical implications of such objectification. Some feminists such as Naomi Wolf find the concept of physical attractiveness itself to be problematic, { Wolf, Naomi. (1992). The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women. New York: William Morrow and Co. (Reprinted, 2002. New York: Harper Perennial) ISBN 0-06-051218-0 } with some radical feminists being opposed to any evaluation of another person&apos;s sexual attractiveness based on physical characteristics. John Stoltenberg goes so far as to condemn as wrongfully objectifying any sexual fantasy that involves visualization of a woman. { Stoltenberg, John. 1989. Refusing to be a man: Essays on sex and justice. Portland, OR: Breitenbush Books. (Reprinted, 2000. Oxford: Routledge) ISBN 1-84142-041-7 } Radical feminists view objectification as playing a central role in reducing women to what they refer to as the &quot; sex class &quot;. While some feminists view mass media in societies that they argue are patriarchal to be objectifying, they often focus on pornography as playing an egregious role in habituating men to objectify women. [ MacKinnon Catharine Only Words 1992 Harvard University Press 978-0-674-63934-8 ] Other feminists, particularly those identified with sex-positive feminism, take a different view of sexual objectification and see it as a problem when it is not counterbalanced by women&apos;s sense of their own sexual subjectivity. [ April 2008 ] Some social conservatives have taken up aspects of the feminist critique of sexual objectification. In their view however, the increase in the sexual objectification of both sexes in Western culture is one of the negative legacies of the sexual revolution. { &quot; Dr. Dobson &quot;.

Is Average the New Ugly? } { Plugged In Online } { Subtle Dangers of Pornogaphy } These critics, notably Wendy Shalit, advocate a return to pre-sexual revolution standards of sexual morality, which Shalit refers to as a &quot; return to modesty &quot;, as an antidote to sexual objectification. { Shalit, Wendy. 2000. Modesty revisited. } { Boundless webzine. } Other feminists contest feminist claims about the objectification of women. Camille Paglia holds that &quot; Turning people into sex objects is one of the specialties of our species. &quot; In her view, objectification is closely tied to (and may even be identical with) the highest human faculties toward conceptualization and aesthetics. [ Paglia Camille Sexual Personae: Art &amp; Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson Vintage August 20, 1991 0-679-73579-8 ISBN 978-0-6797-3579-3 ] Individualist feminist Wendy McElroy holds that the label &quot; sex object &quot; means nothing because inanimate objects are not sexual. She continues that women are their bodies as well as their minds and souls. { McElroy, Wendy. 2006. A feminist overview of pornography, ending in a defense thereof. WendyMcElroy.com. } [ Objectification theory ] Objectification Theory is based on the principle that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observations of others. These observations can take place in the media or through personal experience. { Bartky, Sandra Lee. (1990). Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression. Routledge. ISBN 978-0-415-90186-4. p 26. } Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, females are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a third person perception, which is identified as self-objectification. { Kaschak, Edward. (1992). Engendered Lives: A new Psychology of Women&apos;s Experience (Basic Books). ISBN 0-465-01349-X. p 12. } Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self objectification of women is believed to influence social gender roles and inequalities between the sexes. { Goldenberg, Jamie L., and Tomi-Ann Roberts. (2004). The beast within the beauty: An existential perspective on the objectification and condemnation of women. In: J Greenberg, SL Koole, T Pyszczynski (eds), Handbook of experimental existential psychology; p 71–85. (Guilford Press). ISBN 978-1-59385-040-1. } Some research questions the existence of sexual objectification. Some research shows that people do not so much objectify others but redistributes mental states in others { http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/mind-body.pdf } [ Self-objectification ] Self-objectification can increase in elicit situations which heightens the awareness of an individual’s physical appearance. { Fredrickson, Barbara L. and Kristen Harrison. (2005). Throwing like a girl: Self-objectification predicts adolescent girl&apos;s motor performance. Journal of Sport and Social Issues 29(1):79–101. } [ 10.1177/0193723504269878 ] {. p 82. } Here, the presence of a third person observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are looking at them, or will be looking at them, they are more likely to care about their physical appearance. Examples of enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer. [ Women, girls, and self-objectification ] Primarily, objectification theory describes how women and girls are influenced as a result of expected social and gender roles. Research indicates not all women are influenced equally, due to the anatomical, hormonal, and genetic differences of the female body; however, women’s bodies are often objectified and evaluated more frequently. { Fredrickson and Harrison (2005), p 90–95. } Females learn that their physical appearance is important to themselves and society. As a result, females consider their physical appearance often, expecting that others will also. Sexual objectification occurs when a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body. The purpose of this recognition is to bring enjoyment to others, or to serve as a sexual object for society. { LeMoncheck, Linda. (1997). Loose Women, Lecherous Men: A Feminist Philosophy of Sex (Oxford University Press). ISBN 978-0-19-510556-8. p 133. } Sexual objectification can occur as a social construct among individuals. [ Psychological consequences ] Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. { Fredrickson, Barbara L.; Tomi-Ann Roberts. (1997). &quot; Objectification Theory: Toward understanding women&apos;s lived experiences and mental health risks &quot;. Psychology of Women Quarterly 21(2):173–206. } [ 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x ] {. Retrieved on 2009-4-11. } These include increased self consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats ( depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction ), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels. { Allen Jones which incorporates a woman in the furniture } [ Sexual fetishism ] Sexual fetishism can be considered sexual objectification when a person is assigned or adopts the status of the fetish object. In BDSM activities, even though it is consensual, subjecting a submissive to erotic humiliation can be regarded as sexual objectification. Human furniture is a form of fetishism and sexual objectification. Allen Jones &apos; &quot; Hat Stand and Table Sculpture &quot; incorporates semi-naked women into furniture, and are regarded as sexual objectification.
