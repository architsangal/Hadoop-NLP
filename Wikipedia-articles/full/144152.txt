Traveling Light Media, 2003. Media Review Digest, MRD05052940. [5 Sep 2010] ] He has stated that a viewing of the film How the West Was Won at the age of seven had &quot; formed &quot; his childhood. Spending his teenage years in various parts of California as his father&apos;s career progressed, Costner has described this as a period when he &quot; lost a lot of confidence &quot;, having to make new friends often. Costner lived in Orange County, then in Visalia ( Tulare County ), attending Mt. Whitney High School, and then back to Ventura, graduating from Buena High School in 1973. He went on to earn a B.A. in marketing and finance from California State University, Fullerton, in 1978. [ Post-graduation ] Costner became interested in acting while in his last year of college, and on graduation married Cindy Silva. The couple honeymooned in Puerto Vallarta and on the return plane journey had a chance encounter with actor and fellow passenger Richard Burton, who had purchased all the seats around him for solitude. Burton agreed to speak to Costner after he finished his book. Costner, who had been taking acting classes, but had not told his wife about his desire to be an actor, watched Burton closely and approached when Burton gestured. Costner told Burton that he would prefer that his life was not filled with the type of drama that had followed Burton and asked if he would have to tolerate that if he became an actor. Burton replied, &quot; You have green eyes. I have green eyes. I think you&apos;ll be fine. &quot; After landing, Burton&apos;s limousine pulled up to the curb where Costner and Cindy were waiting for a taxi, where Burton wished Costner luck. Costner would never see Burton again, but credits Burton with partially contributing to his career.

His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took work which allowed him to develop his acting skills via tuition, including working on fishing boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of stars&apos; Hollywood homes to support the couple while he also made the audition rounds. [ Career ] [ Acting ] Costner in 2003 Costner allegedly made his film debut in the film Sizzle Beach, U.S.A. Although a biography claims it was actually filmed in the winter of 1978-1979, the film was not released until 1986. Costner made a very brief cameo in the 1982 Ron Howard film Night Shift, he is listed in the credits as &apos;Frat Boy #1&apos; and appears at the climax of a frat-style, blow-out party in the New York City morgue, when the music is suddenly stopped by a frantic Henry Winkler, Costner can be seen holding a beer and looking surprised at the sudden halt of celebration. He appeared in a commercial for the Apple Lisa and Table for Five in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the nuclear holocaust film Testament. Later, he was cast in The Big Chill and filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed from the final cut. His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together. All that is seen of him are his hair and his slashed wrists as the mortician dresses his corpse in the movie&apos;s opening scenes. { The Big Chill at IMDB, trivia } Costner was a friend of director Lawrence Kasdan, who promised the actor a role in a future project. That became 1985&apos;s Silverado and a breakout role for Costner. He also starred that year in the smaller films Fandango and American Flyers. Full-blown movie star status for Costner arrived in 1987, when he starred as federal agent Eliot Ness in The Untouchables and in the leading role of the thriller No Way Out. He solidified his A-list status in the baseball-themed films Bull Durham (1988) and Field of Dreams (1989). Costner&apos;s next success came with the epic Dances with Wolves (1990). He directed and starred in the film and served as one of its producers. The film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including two for him personally ( Best Picture and Best Director ). The same year saw the release of Revenge, in which he starred along with Anthony Quinn and Madeleine Stowe, directed by Tony Scott (Costner had wanted to direct it himself). He followed this with Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), the Oliver Stone -directed JFK (1991), The Bodyguard (1992), and Clint Eastwood &apos;s A Perfect World (1993), all of which provided box office or critical acclaim. He then took the title role in the biopic Wyatt Earp (1994), directed by Kasdan. It received bad reviews and flopped [ September 2011 ] at the box office. The science fiction - post-apocalyptic epics Waterworld (1995) and The Postman (1997), the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures. However, The Postman results were worse than Waterworld and ended up &quot; winning &quot; five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner. [ http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1998 18th Annual Golden Raspeberry Awards Internet Movie Database 2010-11-02 ] Costner then starred in the golf comedy Tin Cup (1996) for Ron Shelton, who had previously directed him in Bull Durham. He developed the film Air Force One and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing The Postman instead. He personally offered the project to Harrison Ford. His career revived somewhat in 2000 with Thirteen Days, in which he portrayed a top adviser to John F. Kennedy. The western Open Range, which he directed and starred in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially. He received some of his best reviews for his supporting role as retired professional baseball player Denny Davies in The Upside of Anger, for which he received a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association and won the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. After that, Costner starred in The Guardian and in Mr. Brooks, in which he portrayed a serial killer. In 2008, Costner starred in Swing Vote. Costner was honored on September 6, 2006 when his hand and foot prints were set in concrete in front of Grauman&apos;s Chinese Theatre alongside those of other celebrated actors and entertainers. In 2010, The Company Men debuted on the Sundance Festival starring Costner with Ben Affleck. It had good reviews. It was released in cinemas worldwide in January 2011. The film was considered to be an Oscar contender, but did not get a nomination. Costner announced that he would be returning to the director&apos;s chair for the first time in seven years in 2011 with A Little War of Our Own. The film is about a local sheriff who must keep his town from erupting into violence during World War II. The other lead role is that of a German U-boat captain. The screenplay is by Dan Gordon, who co-wrote another sheriff movie for Costner, 1994&apos;s Wyatt Earp. In January 2012 Costner had to admit funding did not come through, and that he still hopes to make it in 2013. He was also about to team up again with director Kevin Reynolds in Learning Italian. Costner would play a CIA agent stationed in a coastal Italian town in order to keep an eye on a KGB operative. However, the movie did not get past pre-production phase because they could not get the money together and it is currently not known if the movie will ever be made. He also appears, as a special cameo, in Funny or Die &apos;s &quot; Field of Dreams 2: Lockout &quot;. Warner Bros. confirmed that Costner would portray Jonathan Kent in the upcoming rebooted Superman film, Man of Steel, directed by Zack Snyder. { Kevin Costner Confirmed for Superman! | Superhero Hype } In 2011, Costner confirmed his role in Quentin Tarantino &apos;s Django Unchained.

The casino, its sports bar Diamond Lil&apos;s, and its restaurant Jake&apos;s are named after characters and locations from the movie Silverado. The facility contains posters, costumes, and other memorabilia from Costner&apos;s films. In July 2004, Costner fired Francis and Carla Caneva, who managed the Midnight Star. A judge subsequently ordered Costner to pay a percentage of $6.1 million to buy out the Canevas as his business partners. In October 2006, Costner asked the South Dakota Supreme Court to re-examine the ruling, as an accountant hired by the actor had determined the market value of the casino to be $3.1 million. { Costner appeals in casino wrangle, BBC } In 1995, Costner began developing oil separation machines based on a patent he purchased from the US government. The machines developed by the company were of little commercial interest until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when BP took six of the machines from a company in which Costner owned an interest, Ocean Therapy Solutions, for testing in late May 2010.

The suit claims that Costner kept a meeting with BP secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18 million down payment on a $52 million purchase and that after the down payment but before any announcement another investor used part of the downpayment to buy out their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from the total sale.
