They are the sole living members of the family Platanaceae. All members of Platanus are tall, reaching 30 to 50 meters in height. All except for P. kerrii are deciduous, and most are found in riparian or other wetland habitats in the wild, though proving drought -tolerant in cultivation. The hybrid London Plane has proved particularly tolerant of urban conditions. They are often known in English as planes or plane trees. Some North American species are called sycamores (especially Platanus occidentalis [ Merriam Webster ] ), although that term also refers to either the fig Ficus sycomorus, the plant originally so named, or the Great, or Sycamore Maple, Acer pseudoplatanus. [ Merriam Webster ] [ Botany ] { Dubrovnik, Croatia } The flowers are reduced and are borne in balls (globose heads); 3–7 hairy sepal s may be fused at the base, and the petals are 3–7 and are spatulate. Male and female flowers are separate, but borne on the same plant ( monoecious ). The number of heads in one cluster ( inflorescence ) is indicative of the species (see table below). The male flower has 3–8 stamen s; the female has a superior ovary with 3–7 carpel s. Plane trees are wind-pollinated. Male flower-heads fall off after shedding their pollen. After being pollinated, the female flowers become achene s that form an aggregate ball. Typically, the core of the ball is 1  cm in diameter and is covered with a net of mesh 1  mm, which can be peeled off. The ball is 2.5–4  cm in diameter and contains several hundred achenes, each of which has a single seed and is conical, with the point attached downward to the net at the surface of the ball. There is also a tuft of many thin stiff yellow-green bristle fibers attached to the base of each achene. These bristles help in wind dispersion of the fruits as in the dandelion. The leaves are simple. In the subgenus Platanus they have a palmate outline. The base of the leaf stalk (petiole) is enlarged and completely wraps around the young stem bud in its axil. The axillary bud is exposed only after the leaf falls off. The mature bark peels off or exfoliates easily in irregularly shaped patches, producing a mottled, scaly appearance. On old trunks, bark may not flake off, but thickens and cracks instead. [ Phylogeny ] { Prince Miloš&apos;s Residence in } { Belgrade, } { Serbia. } Avenue of plane trees { Bayeux, Normandie, France } { Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert } { South America. } There are two subgenera, subgenus Castaneophyllum containing the anomalous P. kerrii, and subgenus Platanus, with all the others; recent studies in Mexico [ Nixon Poole 2003 ] have increased the number of accepted species in this subgenus. Within subgenus Platanus, genetic evidence suggests that P. racemosa is more closely related to P. orientalis than it is to the other North American species. [ Feng Oh Manos 2005 ] There are fossil records of plane trees as early as 115 million years (the Lower Cretaceous). Despite the geographic separation between North America and Old World, species from these continents will cross readily resulting in fertile hybrid s such as the London Plane.

The worst infections are associated with cold, wet spring weather. P. occidentalis and the other American species are the most susceptible, with P. orientalis the most resistant. The hybrid London Plane is intermediate in resistance. Ceratocystis platani, a wilt disease, has become a significant problem in recent years in much of Europe. [ Pathology note 7 2008 ] Other diseases such as powdery mildew occur frequently, but are of lesser importance. Platanus species are used as food plants by the larva e of some Lepidoptera species including Phyllonorycter platani and Setaceous Hebrew Character. [ Uses ] The principal use of these trees is as ornamental trees, especially in urban areas and by roadsides. The London plane is particularly popular for this purpose. The American plane is cultivated sometimes for timber and investigations have been made into its use as a biomass crop. The oriental plane is widely used as an ornamental and also has a number of minor medicinal uses. [ Cultural history ] Most significant aspects of cultural history apply to Platanus orientalis in the Old World.
