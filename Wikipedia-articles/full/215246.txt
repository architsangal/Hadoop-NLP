Produced by frontman Billy Corgan with Flood and Alan Moulder, the twenty-eight-track album was released as a two-disc CD and triple LP. The album features a wide array of styles, as well as greater musical input from bassist D&apos;arcy Wretzky and second guitarist James Iha. Led by the single &quot; Bullet with Butterfly Wings &quot;, the record debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the first and only such occurrence for the group. The album spawned five more singles— &quot; 1979 &quot;, &quot; Zero &quot;, &quot; Tonight, Tonight &quot;, the promotional &quot; Muzzle &quot;, and &quot; Thirty-Three &quot; —over the course of 1996, and has been certified nine times platinum by the RIAA. Praised by critics for its ambition and scope, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness earned the band seven Grammy Award nominations in 1997. [ Recording and production ] After the thirteen-month tour in support of The Smashing Pumpkins&apos; second album Siamese Dream (1993), Billy Corgan immediately began writing songs for the band&apos;s next record. [ Kot, Greg Double Take: Smashing Pumpkins raises the stakes with &apos;Mellon Collie&apos; Chicago Tribune October 22, 1995 http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-22/news/9510220139_1_siamese-dream-lollapalooza-tour-pumpkins October 4, 2011 ] From the outset, the band intended the new record to be a double album, partly inspired by The Beatles &apos; White Album. { Alexander, Phil. Interview with Billy Corgan. } { Mojo Magazine. February 2012. } Corgan said, &quot; We almost had enough material to make Siamese Dream a double album. With this new album, I really liked the notion that we would create a wider scope in which to put other kinds of material we were writing. &quot; { di Perna, Alan. &quot; Zero Worship &quot;. Guitar World. December 1995. } Corgan felt that the band&apos;s musical approach was running its course, and wanted the band to approach the album as if it were its last. [ Fricke, David November 16, 1995 The Rolling Stone Interview: Billy Corgan Rolling Stone 721 October 4, 2011 http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/smashingpumpkins/articles/story/5938710/smashing_pumpkins http://www.webcitation.org/62C60juaJ December 31, 2008 ] Corgan described the album at the time to the music press as &quot; The Wall for Generation X &quot;, a comparison with Pink Floyd &apos;s 1979 album, one of the highest selling and best known concept albums of all time. { DeRogatis, Jim. Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90&apos;s. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. ISBN 0-306-81271-1, p. 46, 80 } The band decided to forgo working with Butch Vig, who had produced the group&apos;s previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as co-producers. Corgan explained, &quot; To be completely honest, I think it was a situation where we&apos;d become so close to Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... I just felt we had to force the situation, sonically, and take ourselves out of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn&apos;t want to repeat past Pumpkin work. &quot; Flood immediately pushed the band to change its recording practices. Corgan later said, &quot; Flood felt like the band he would see live wasn&apos;t really captured on record &quot; and attempted to capture that sound on record. In April 1995, the band began recording in a rehearsal space, instead of entering the studio straight away. [ Corgan Billy Billy Corgan Iha James James Iha Wretzky D&apos;arcy D&apos;arcy Wretzky Chamberlin Jimmy Jimmy Chamberlin Smashing Pumpkins Rockumentary MTV October 17, 1995 ] At these sessions, the band recorded rough rhythm tracks with Flood. Originally designed to create a rough draft for the record, the rehearsal space sessions ended up yielding much of the new album&apos;s rhythm section parts. Flood also insisted the band set aside time each day devoted to jamming or songwriting, practices the band had never engaged in before during recording sessions. Corgan said, &quot; Working like that kept the whole process very interesting—kept it from becoming a grind. &quot; Corgan sought to eliminate the tension that permeated the Siamese Dream recording sessions. Corgan said regarding the problems with recording Siamese Dream, &quot; [T]o me, the biggest offender was the insidious amounts of time that everyone spends waiting for guitar parts to be overdubbed. There were literally weeks where no one had anything to do but sit and wait. &quot; The band decided to counter idleness by using two recording rooms at the same time. This tactic allowed Corgan to work on vocals and song arrangements while recording was done in the other. During these sessions, Flood and Corgan would work in one room as Moulder, guitarist James Iha, and bassist D&apos;arcy Wretzky worked in a second. { Thomas, Richard. &quot; Signal to Noise: The Sonic Diary of the Smashing Pumpkins &quot;. EQ Magazine. October 2008. } Iha and Wretzky had a much greater role in the recording of the album, unlike the prior albums where Corgan was rumored to have recorded all the bass and guitar parts himself. [ Browne, David http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C299271%2C00.html Pumpkin Batch EW.com October 27, 1995 May 11, 2008 ] James Iha commented about the recording sessions, The big change is that Billy is not being the big &apos;I do this-I do that&apos;. It&apos;s much better. The band arranged a lot of songs for this record, and the song writing process was organic. The circumstances of the last record and the way that we worked was really bad. { Kelly, Christina. &quot; Smashing Pumpkins-The Multi-Platinum Band is over the infighting but can the harmony last? &quot; US. December 1995. } Following the rehearsal space sessions, the band recorded overdubs at the Chicago Recording Company. Pro Tools was used for recording guitar overdubs as well as for post-production electronic looping and sampling. { &quot; No More Guitars. &quot; BigO Magazine, 1995. } Wretzky also recorded numerous backup vocal parts, but all were cut except the one recorded for &quot; Beautiful &quot;. { Evans, Liz. &quot; The Last Word &quot;. Kerrang. May/June 1996. } When the recording sessions concluded, the band had 57 completed songs which were up for contention to be included on Mellon Collie. [ Corgan Billy Billy Corgan Iha James James Iha Wretzky D&apos;arcy D&apos;arcy Wretzky Hora Prima MTV Latin America December 19, 1996 ] The album was going to have 32 songs, but this was cut back to 28 songs. { Corgan, Billy. &quot; King B&apos;s &quot;. Guitar World. January 1997. } [ Music ] [ BulletWithButterflyWings.ogg &quot; Bullet with Butterfly Wings &quot; One of the album&apos;s more aggressive songs, &quot; Bullet with Butterfly Wings &quot; was the first single from Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness 1979.ogg &quot; 1979 &quot; &quot; 1979 &quot; from Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness ] The songs of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are intended to hang together conceptually, with the two halves of the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more &quot; loose &quot; and &quot; vague &quot; than the band&apos;s previous records. [ C.

[ http://www.spfc.org/online/qualityposts.html?content_id%3D542 Listessa Interviews Billy Corgan Daher, Karl SPFC.org May 29, 1998 April 18, 2007 ] Corgan aimed the album&apos;s message at people aged 14 to 24 years, hoping &quot; to sum up all the things I felt as a youth but was never able to voice articulately. &quot; He summed up by stating, &quot; I&apos;m waving goodbye to me in the rear view mirror, tying a knot around my youth and putting it under the bed. &quot; The sprawling nature of the album means that it utilizes several different diverse styles amongst the songs, contrasting what some critics felt was the &quot; one dimensional flavor &quot; of the previous two albums. A much wider variety of instrumentation is used, such as piano ( &quot; Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness &quot; ), synthesizers and drum loops ( &quot; 1979 &quot; ), a live orchestra ( &quot; Tonight, Tonight &quot; ), and even salt shakers and scissors ( &quot; Cupid de Locke &quot; ). All guitars on the album were tuned down a semitone in order to &quot; make the music a little lower &quot;, according to Corgan. On some songs, like &quot; Jellybelly &quot;, the sixth string was tuned down an additional tone to C# (referred to by Corgan as &quot; the &apos; grunge tuning&apos; &quot; ). There was a greater variety to the number of guitar overdubs utilized than on previous albums. Iha said, &quot; [I]n the past, everything had to be overdubbed and layered—guitar overkill. That wasn&apos;t really the train of thought this time, although we did that too. &quot; &quot; To Forgive &quot; consists of only one live guitar take, while &quot; Thru the Eyes of Ruby &quot; contains approximately 70  guitar tracks. The various sections of &quot; Porcelina of the Vast Oceans” were recorded at various times, with different instruments and recording setups, and were digitally composited in Pro Tools. Corgan and Iha shared soloing duties; Iha estimated that the guitar solo duties were divided &quot; half and half &quot; on the record. All but two songs on the album were written by Corgan. The closing track from the first disc, &quot; Take Me Down &quot;, was written and sung by Iha, while the album&apos;s final track, &quot; Farewell and Goodnight &quot;, features lead vocals by all four band members and, according to the BMI database, was written solely by Iha, { &quot; BMI Publishing Database for Farewell and Goodnight &quot; www.bmi.com. Access date: November 30, 2011. } despite being credited on the album liner notes as being written by both Iha and Corgan. Iha wrote additional songs during the making of the album, but they did not make the final cut. Corgan said in a 1995 Rolling Stone interview, &quot; [T]here are some B sides that James did that are really good. They just don&apos;t fit in the context of the album. And part of me feels bad. But over the seven years we&apos;ve been together, the least uptight part of the band has been the music. &quot; [ Release and reception ] Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was released on October 24, 1995. The night before, the band played a release party show at the Riviera Theater in Chicago and took part in a live FM broadcast across the U.S. The following week, Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200, an unusual feat for a double-disc album that cost over US$ 20.

Christopher John Farley of Time called the album &quot; the group&apos;s most ambitious and accomplished work yet &quot;. Farley wrote, &quot; One gets the feeling that the band [...] charged ahead on gut instincts; the sheer scope of the album (28 songs) didn&apos;t allow for second-guessing or contrivance. &quot; { Farley, Christopher John. &quot; A Journey, Not a Joyride &quot;. Time. November 13, 1995. } Time selected Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness as the best album of the year in its year-end &quot; Best of 1995 &quot; list. [ The Best of 1995 Time.com December 25, 1995 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C983899%2C00.html January 8, 2008 ] Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A rating; reviewer David Browne praised the group&apos;s ambition and wrote, &quot; Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is more than just the work of a tortured, finicky pop obsessive. Corgan presents himself as one of the last true believers: someone for whom spewing out this much music results in some sort of high art for the ages. He doesn&apos;t seem concerned with persistent alterna-rock questions of &apos;selling out&apos;, and good for him: He&apos;s aiming for something bigger and all-conquering. &quot; [ Browne, David &quot; Pumpkin Batch &quot; [Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadnessreview &amp; #93; EW.com October 27, 1995 http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C299271%2C00.html January 8, 2008 ] Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars. Reviewer Jim DeRogatis praised the album as &quot; one of the rare epic rock releases whose bulk is justified in the grooves &quot;. The writer stated that the album&apos;s main flaw was Corgan&apos;s lyrics, describing the songwriter as &quot; wallowing in his own misery and grousing about everyone and everything not meeting his expectations. &quot; DeRogatis contended that while Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness &quot; may even match The Wall in its sonic accomplishments &quot;, Corgan&apos;s lyrics lacked in comparison. { DeRogatis, p. 80-82 } Mojo reviewer Ben Edmunds also praised the music while criticizing Corgan&apos;s lyrics. Edmunds wrote, &quot; [Corgan&apos;s] lyrics appear to be the repository for the worst aspects of his most treasured influences. He writes with a heavy metal aptitude for wordplay and an inflated prog-rock conviction of its worth, a deadening combination. But there&apos;s a sliver of distance in his rage-mongering now that comments as well as expresses. &quot; { Edmunds, Ben. &quot; Smashing Pumpkins: Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness &quot;. Mojo. December 1995. } [ Singles ] The album spawned five singles. While Corgan considered issuing &quot; Jellybelly &quot; as the album&apos;s first single, he told Chart it was passed over in favor of &quot; Bullet with Butterfly Wings &quot; because &quot; &apos;Bullet&apos;s one of those songs where, you know, it&apos;s easy to sing along to and [he affects a drawl] ya gotta sell them records. &quot; { Meredith, Amber.

November 1995. } &quot; Bullet with Butterfly Wings &quot; was The Smashing Pumpkins&apos; first single to reach the Top 40 on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; Hot 100, peaking at number 22. &quot; 1979 &quot;, the album&apos;s second single, charted at number 12, becoming the band&apos;s highest-charting American hit.
