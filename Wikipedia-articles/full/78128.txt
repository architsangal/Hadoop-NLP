According to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, the Turnpike is the nation&apos;s sixth-busiest toll road and is among one of the most heavily traveled highways in the United States. [ Dennis Cauchon http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-01-27-tolls_N.htm Drivers to see major toll hikes June 2, 2009 January 27, 2008 USA Today http://www.webcitation.org/600PIUX4s July 7, 2011 ] Having a total of [ 122.40 mi km 2 on ], the Turnpike&apos;s southern terminus begins at Interstate 295 (I-295) near the border of Pennsville and Carneys Point Townships in Salem County, one mile east of the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Its northern terminus is located at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, Bergen County. The Turnpike is a major thoroughfare providing access to various localities in New Jersey, as well as Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York. The route divides into four roadways at Exit 8A, with lanes restricted to carrying only car s, and with lanes for cars, truck s and bus es. The northern part of the mainline turnpike, along with the entirety of its extensions and spurs, is part of the Interstate Highway System, designated as Interstate 95 (I-95) between Exit 6 and its northern end. South of Exit  6, it has the unsigned Route  700 designation. There are two extensions and one spur, including the Newark Bay Extension, which carries Interstate 78 (I-78); the Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension (officially the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension); and the Western Spur. Construction of the mainline from conceptualization to completion took 23  months, from 1950 to 1952. It was officially opened to traffic in November 1951, between its southern terminus and Exit  10.

[ Route description ] Changeable signage in the northbound cars-only lanes for the split into the Eastern and Western Spurs 250px { Hightstown, facing south } The main road of the New Jersey Turnpike splits from I-295 in Carneys Point Township and runs a north-northeast route to Ridgefield Park, where the road continues as I-95. It is designated Route 700, an unsigned route, from Exit 1 ( Delaware Memorial Bridge ) to Exit 6, and as I-95 from Exit 6 ( Mansfield Township ) to Exit 18 ( Secaucus / Carlstadt ). The number of lanes ranges from 4 lanes south of Exit 4 ( Mount Laurel Township ), 6 lanes between Exit 4 and Exit 8A ( Monroe Township ), 10 lanes between Exit 8A and Exit 9 ( East Brunswick ), 12 lanes between Exit 9 and Exit 11 ( Woodbridge Township ), and 14 lanes between Exit 11 and Exit 14 ( Newark ). Before the advent of the Interstate Highways, the entire Turnpike was designated by the New Jersey Department of Transportation as Route 700, with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension being Route 700P and the Newark Bay Hudson County Extension being Route 700N. None of these state highway designations have ever been signed. Beginning just south of Exit 8A, the Turnpike splits into a &quot; dual-dual &quot; configuration similar to a local-express configuration, with the outer lanes open to all vehicles and the inner lanes limited to cars only, unless signed otherwise because of unusual conditions. Specifically, starting in Monroe Township (going north), the Turnpike has a total of 10 lanes, 5 in each direction (2-3-3-2). From East Brunswick, the Turnpike has a total of 12 lanes, 6 in each direction (3-3-3-3). From Woodbridge Township to Newark, High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes exist on the outer roadway (outer truck lanes), thereby making it 7 lanes in each direction (4-3-3-4). The HOV lanes are in effect on weekdays, from 6:00 a.m. –9:00 a.m. northbound, and 4 p.m. –7 p.m. southbound (at times, the Turnpike Authority might suspend the HOV restrictions entirely during peaks hours in case of unusual conditions).

Both spurs are signed as I-95. The Western Spur is posted for through traffic on I-95 seeking Interstate 280 (I-280) and the George Washington Bridge, while traffic seeking U.S. Route 46 (U.S. 46), Interstate 80 (I-80), and the Lincoln Tunnel is routed via the Eastern Spur. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), which calls every class of highway Route, calls the western spur Route 95W. { Delta Air Lines } { Boeing 757 flies very low over the Turnpike, just north of } { Newark Liberty International Airport. } The Turnpike also has two extensions; the first, the Newark Bay Extension, was opened in 1956 and is a part of I-78. It connects Newark with Lower Manhattan via the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City and intersects the mainline near Newark Liberty International Airport. This extension contains three exits (Exits 14A, 14B, and 14C) and due to its design (four lanes with a shoulderless Jersey barrier divider), it has a [ 50 mi/h km/h -1 on ] speed limit. The second extension, known as the Pearl Harbor Extension, connects the mainline of the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 6 with the Pennsylvania Turnpike. A [ 6 mi km 0 on ] long six-lane highway, it not only connects the Pennsylvania Turnpike with the mainline, but also has an exit to U.S. Route 130 (U.S. 130) near Florence. It was formerly designated as Route 700P, but is currently designated I-95 in anticipation of the completion of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project in 2017. [ PA Turnpike / I-95 Interchange Project http://www.paturnpikei95.com/construction/ConstructionHome.htm PA Turnpike May 1, 2012 ] A [ 4 mi km 0 on ] stretch of I-95 north of U.S. 46 came under Turnpike Authority jurisdiction in 1992, as NJDOT sold the road in order to balance the state budget. This section of the road travels past the interchange for I-80 and through a cut in the Hudson Palisades at GWB Plaza. This portion of the Turnpike is also &quot; dual-dual &quot;, split into local and express lanes, as it approaches the George Washington Bridge. A section of the Turnpike and the surrounding land in Elizabeth and Newark, New Jersey has been called &quot; the most dangerous two miles in America &quot; by New Jersey Homeland Security officials due to the high volume of traffic in conjunction with the density of potential terrorist targets in the surrounding area.

The Newark Bay Bridge (officially the Vincent R. Casciano Memorial Bridge) is a steel cantilever bridge spanning Newark Bay and connecting Newark and Bayonne. It was completed April 4, 1956, as part of the Turnpike&apos;s Newark Bay Extension. The Chaplain Washington Bridge and the Harry Laderman Bridge are steel girder spans that carry the Turnpike&apos;s eastern and western spurs, respectively, over the Passaic River at Newark. The Lewandowski Hackensack River Bridge carrying the Eastern Spur over the Hackensack River was named in honor of the three Lewandowski brothers, who were killed in action during World War II within 18 months of each other. The Luke A. Lovely Memorial Bridge carries the Turnpike over the Rahway River immediately north of Exit 12. Luke Lovely was the first soldier from New Jersey to die in World War I. He died on November 30, 1917 near Cambrai, France. [ Tolls ] A toll ticket received at Exit 11 in 2012. { Monroe Township } { VMS sign displaying a warning about road construction ahead.

The New Jersey Turnpike is a closed-system toll road, using a system of long-distance tickets, obtained once by a motorist upon entering and surrendered upon exiting at toll gates. The toll gates exist at all exits and entrances (except for the Meadowlands Sports Complex and the highway extension toward the Hudson River). The toll fee depends on the distance traveled between entrance and exit, and longer distances result in higher tolls. [ 2012 ], the automobile toll from Exit 1 to Exit 18 is $13.85. If the ticket is lost, one must pay the highest toll fee upon exiting. In September 2000, the Turnpike introduced E-ZPass electronic toll collection.

One of these high-speed toll gates is located at the northern terminus of the road, as southbound I-95 traffic enters the Turnpike. The newest one is located at the southern terminus in Carneys Point. There is also a high-speed E-ZPass entry point on the Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension. At each location, traditional E-ZPass and cash lanes are also available. As of 2011, every toll lane on the Turnpike accepts E-ZPass. When traveling from the North, users who exit at the Meadowlands Sports Complex pay no toll, but the Turnpike Authority counts cars electronically and is paid a fee for each vehicle by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. The non-tolled I-295, which parallels the Turnpike for much of its southern length, is often used as an alternate route for shunpiking by locals and through travelers alike; prior to the expansion of the Exit 1 toll plaza, this route was promoted through signage and radio announcements from the New Jersey State Police as a bypass of summer congestion at the plaza. On January 8, 2008, Governor Jon Corzine proposed a 50 percent increase in tolls on New Jersey&apos;s three toll roads in 2010, with increases of a similar percentage every four years after that, in order to help pay state debt. Each times tolls increased, there would be an additional increase for inflation since the last toll increase (for the first, since 2006). The roads would be maintained by a nonprofit corporation that would pay back bonds to the state. Under this plan, and without considering the inflation increases, tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike would have risen from $6.45 to $42.92 in 2022. [ McCoy Craig R.

Most rest stops also include a Sunoco, with gas price signs posted about half a mile before reaching the rest stop. There was a service area on the northbound side where Exit 13A is located, before it opened in 1982. The service area usage overlapped the existence of Exit 13A (where northbound drivers who took Exit 13A missed the service area, and vice versa) but is no longer in existence. Today, it can be seen by motorists when exiting at 13A from the northbound car lanes since there is a temporary concrete barrier that is obstructing an open asphalt lot.

[ Headquarters and operations facilities ] [ New Jersey Turnpike Authority ] [ History ] right right Route 100 and Route 300 were two state highway s proposed in the 1930s by the New Jersey Department of Transportation as precursors to the New Jersey Turnpike. The road that is now the New Jersey Turnpike was first planned by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (then known as the State Highway Department) as two untolled freeways in 1938. Route 100 was the route from New Brunswick to the George Washington Bridge, plus a spur to the Holland Tunnel (now the Newark Bay Extension of the Turnpike). Route 300 was the southern part of Turnpike from the Delaware Memorial Bridge to New Brunswick. However, NJDOT did not have the funds to complete the two freeways, and very little of the road was built under its auspices.

Route S100 was a proposed spur of Route 100 in Elizabeth. It was never built, although Route 81 follows a similar alignment. Hackensack Run bridge under construction in 1951 According to a letter to the editor written by the daughter of Paul L. Troast, the first chairman of the NJ Turnpike Authority, Kathleen Troast Pitney: [ http://www.nj.com/specialprojects/index.ssf?%2Fspecialprojects%2Fturnpike%2Ftpletters.html Love/hate letters Letter to the Editor Kathleen Troast Pitney The Star-Ledger Newark, New Jersey November 2, 2001 July 7, 2011 ] A brochure &quot; Interesting Facts about the New Jersey Turnpike, &quot; dating from soon after the road&apos;s opening, states that when the Turnpike&apos;s bonds are paid off, &quot; The law provides that the Turnpike be turned over to the State for inclusion in the public highway system. &quot; Due to new construction, and the expectation that the Turnpike pay for policing and maintenance, this has never come to pass. The task of building the Turnpike was not an easy one. One major problem was the construction in the city of Elizabeth, where either 450 homes or 32 businesses would be destroyed, depending on the chosen route. The engineers decided to go through the residential area, since they considered it the grittiest and the closest route to both Newark Airport and the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal seaport. { Meadowlands, near New York City } When construction finally got to Newark, there was a new challenge: deciding to build either over or under the Pulaski Skyway. If construction went above the Skyway, the costs would be much higher. If they went under, the costs would be lower, but the roadway would be very close to the Passaic River, making it harder for ships to pass through. The Turnpike was ultimately built to pass under. While continuing up to the New Jersey Meadowlands, the crossings were harder because of the fertile marsh land of silt and mud. Near the shallow mud, the mud was filled with crushed stone, and the roadway was built above the water table. In the deeper mud, caissons were sunk down to a firm stratum and filled with sand, then both the caissons and the surrounding areas were covered with blankets of sand. Gradually, the water was brought up, and drained into adjacent meadows. Then, the construction of the two major bridges over the Passaic River and Hackensack River were completed. The bridges were built to give motorists a clear view of the New York City skyline, but with high retaining walls to create the illusion of not being on a river crossing. The [ 6955 ft m on ] Passaic River (Chaplain Washington) Bridge cost $13.7 million to construct and the [ 5623 ft m on ] Hackensack River Bridge cost $9.5 million. { Linden, New Jersey } After the Turnpike was built in 1952, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the New York State Thruway Authority proposed a [ 13 mi km on ] extension of the New Jersey Turnpike that would go from its end (at U.S. 46 in Ridgefield Park at the time) up to West Nyack, New York at Interstate 87 (I-87), the New York State Thruway. The portion through New Jersey was to be constructed and maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, while the portion in New York was to be built and maintained by the New York Thruway Authority. The purpose of this extension was to give motorists a &quot; more direct bypass of the New York City area &quot; to New England, by using the Tappan Zee Bridge. The extension was to parallel NY Route 303 and the present-day CSX River Line, and have limited interchanges. It was to have an interchange with the Palisades Interstate Parkway and at I-87/ New York State Thruway in West Nyack. This project did not survive; by 1970, it became too expensive to buy right-of-way access, and community opposition was fierce. Therefore the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the New York State Thruway Authority cancelled the project. Approaching the Exit 11 tollbooths at night in 1992, in the days before E-ZPass With the Turnpike completed, traffic began to increase, which prompted the Turnpike Authority&apos;s first widening project. In 1955, the Authority proposed two widening projects: From four lanes to six lanes (three in each direction) between Exit 4 in Mt. Laurel Township and Exit 10 in Woodbridge Township From four lanes to an eight lane ‘dual-dual’ setup (2-2-2-2, two express carriageways and two local carriageways in each direction) between Exit 10 and Exit 14 in Newark In 1966, the Turnpike was widened between Exit 10 and Exit 14 under a new expansion plan. This abolished the ‘express-local’ roadway plan and created the car and truck-buses lane configuration (3-3-3-3). This project also included closing the old Exit 10 at Woodbridge and replacing it with a new Exit 10 in Edison Township; Exit 11 was also rebuilt to provide complete access to the Garden State Parkway. This dual-dual setup was widened south to Exit 9 in East Brunswick Township in 1973, and extended again further south in 1990 to Exit 8A in Monroe Township. [ http://www.nycroads.com/roads/nj-turnpike/ New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) Steve Anderson Eastern Roads July 7, 2011 ] The widening between Exit 8A-9 created some problems in the East Brunswick area in the late 1980s during the proposed widening from six to twelve lanes. Analysis of noise (Shadely, 1973) and air quality impacts were made in a lawsuit decided in New Jersey Superior Court. This case in the early 1970s was one of the early U.S. examples of environmental scientist s playing a role in the design of a major highway. The computer model s allowed the court to understand the effects of roadway geometry (width in this case), vehicle speeds, proposed noise barrier s, residential setback and pavement types. The outcome was a compromise that involved substantial mitigation of noise pollution and air pollution impacts. The New Jersey Turnpike smog accident was a series of roadway accidents that occurred on the New Jersey Turnpike in the town of Kearny, on October 23 and 24, 1973. The first collision occurred at 11:20 PM EDT on on the 23, and further accidents continued to occur until 2:45 AM the next day as cars plowed into the unseen accident ahead of them. Sixty-six vehicles were involved and nine people died as a result. Thirty-nine suffered non-fatal injuries. The primary cause of the accident was related to a fire consisting of burning garbage, aggravated by foggy conditions.

The delay in closing the affected roadways by the New Jersey State Police contributed to the number of accidents. ] This produced an area of extremely poor visibility. In 1971, the Turnpike Authority proposed to build the Alfred E. Driscoll Expressway. It was to start at the Garden State Parkway south of exit 80 in Dover Township (now Toms River ) and end at the Turnpike approximately 3 miles north of exit 8A in South Brunswick. As a proposed part of the Turnpike system, its seven interchanges would have included toll plazas except at the northern end at the Turnpike. By 1972, the proposed road met fierce opposition from Ocean, Monmouth and Middlesex counties with quality of life being the main concern. The Turnpike Authority proceeded anyway by selling bonds. But by December 1973, the proposal was hit hard when governor-elect Brendan Byrne decided to stop the project altogether. Despite this, the Authority continued with its plan. It wasn&apos;t until February 1977, that the Authority ended its plan to build the road. { Turnpike Drops Cross-State Road } The rights-of-way were sold in 1979, indefinitely shelving the project.
