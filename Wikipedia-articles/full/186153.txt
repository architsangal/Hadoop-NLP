Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds to create internal rhyming within phrase s or sentences, and together with alliteration and consonance { Khurana, Ajeet &quot; Assonance and Consonance &quot; Outstanding Writing. } serves as one of the building blocks of verse. For example, in the phrase &quot; Do you like blue? &quot;, the [ /uː/ ] ( &quot; o &quot; / &quot; ou &quot; / &quot; ue &quot; sound) is repeated within the sentence and is assonant. Assonance is found more often in verse than in prose. It is used in (mainly modern) English-language poetry, and is particularly important in Old French, Spanish and the Celtic languages. The eponym ous student of Willy Russell&apos;s Educating Rita described it as &quot; getting the rhyme wrong &quot;.
