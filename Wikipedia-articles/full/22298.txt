The organization was founded in February 1998, by Bruce Perens and Eric S. Raymond, prompted by Netscape Communications Corporation publishing the source code for its flagship Netscape Communicator product. Later, in August 1998 the organization added a board of directors. Raymond was president from its founding until February 2005. In May 2012 the new board elected Simon Phipps as president.

Nevertheless, he describes his free software movement and the Open Source Initiative as separate camps within the same free software community. According to Stallman, &quot; We disagree with the open source camp on the basic goals and values, but their views and ours lead in many cases to the same practical behavior—such as developing free software. As a result, people from the free software movement and the open source camp often work together on practical projects such as software development. &quot; [ History ] The movement was launched in 1998 by Jon &quot; maddog &quot; Hall, Larry Augustin, Eric S. Raymond, Bruce Perens, and others. { History of the OSI } { A Look Back at 10 Years of OSI } The group adopted the Open Source Definition for open-source software, based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines. They also established the Open Source Initiative (OSI) as a steward organization for the movement. However, they were unsuccessful in their attempt to secure a trademark for &apos;open source&apos; to control the use of the term. { http://opensource2.usrbinruby.net/pressreleases/certified-open-source.html|title=OSI Announcement of losing &apos;open source&apos; trademark } In 2009, the organization was temporarily suspended from operation as a California corporation, apparently in response to a complaint concerning tax paperwork from earlier years.
