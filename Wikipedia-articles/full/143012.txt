A land value tax (or site valuation tax) is a levy on the unimproved value of land. It is an ad valorem tax on land that disregards the value of buildings, personal property and other improvements. A land value tax (LVT) is different from other property tax es, because these are taxes on the whole value of real estate : the combination of land, buildings, and improvements to the site. Although the efficiency of a land value tax has been established knowledge since Adam Smith, [ Smith Adam The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Chapter 2, Article I: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses 1776 Ground-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of houses. A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses. It would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use of his ground. ] it was perhaps most famously promoted by Henry George. In his best selling work ‘’ Progress and Poverty ’’ (1879), George argued that the value of land was created by the community, and therefore its rent belonged to the community. [ Progress and Poverty George Henry 1879 http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp19.htm ] { The often cited passage is titled “The unbound Savannah.” } Land value taxes have been implemented in Taiwan ( Republic of China ), Hong Kong, Singapore, Russia and Estonia, as well as in some localities in the American state of Pennsylvania, the Australian state of New South Wales and Mexicali, in Mexico. The government of the Republic of Ireland is currently considering the introduction of an LVT, among other options for taxing property. [ Economic effects ] The value of the land (and many other macro-economic quantities too) can be expressed using two independent concepts: The value, or, strictly speaking, the price, of a particular site of land is what a fair exchange brings in terms of money during an agreed trade or transaction between two parties, one of whom is the landowner. (This definition is conditional on no LVT being applied, because when it does apply, the exchange value is affected.) The land value of the site is also directly related to its demandable ground-rent, which is its potential for use in either production or residential capacities. The capitalization of this rent gives the land value too. Land which is not useful has no value and is called marginal land, as explained by British economist David Ricardo in 1816. [ Efficiency ] { supply and demand diagram showing the effects of land value taxation. If the supply of land is fixed, the } { burden of the tax will fall entirely on the land owner, with no } { deadweight loss. } Most taxes distort economic decisions. { Coughlin (1999) p.263-4 } If labor, buildings or machinery and plant are taxed, people are dissuaded from constructive and beneficial activities, and enterprise and efficiency are penalized due to the excess burden of taxation. This does not apply to LVT, which is payable regardless of whether or how well the land is actually used. Because the supply of land is inelastic, market land rents depend on what tenants are prepared to pay, rather than on the expenses of landlords, and so LVT cannot be directly passed on to tenants. { Adam Smith, } { The Wealth of Nations } { Book V, Chapter 2, Part 2, Article I: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses } The direct beneficiaries of incremental improvements to the surrounding neighborhood by others would be the land&apos;s occupants, and absentee landlords would benefit only by virtue of price competition amongst present and prospective tenants for those incremental benefits; the only direct effect of LVT on prices in this case is to lower the unearned increment (reduce the amount of the socially generated benefit that is privately captured as an increase in the market price of the land). Put another way, LVT is often said to be justified for economic reasons because if it is implemented properly, it will not deter production, distort market mechanisms or otherwise create deadweight loss es the way other taxes do.

[ Smith Jeffery J. Property Tax Shift Successes The Progress Report 2001 http://www.progress.org/archive/geono05.htm 2008-06-13 ] Proponents, such as Fred Foldvary, state that the necessity to pay the tax encourages landowners to develop vacant and underused land properly or to make way for others who will. They state that because LVT deters speculative land holding, dilapidated inner city areas are returned to productive use, reducing the pressure to build on undeveloped sites and so reducing urban sprawl. [ Foldvary Fred E. Geo-Rent: A Plea to Public Economists Econ Journal Watch 2005 http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-1-april-2005 2 106–132 1 ] For example Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States has taxed land at a rate six times that on improvements since 1975, and this policy has been credited by its long time mayor, Stephen R. Reed with reducing the number of vacant structures in downtown Harrisburg from around 4,200 in 1982 to fewer than 500. LVT is an ecotax because it ostensibly discourages the waste of locations, which are a finite natural resource. [ Mills David E.

Advocates of the land tax claim that it reduces the speculative element in land pricing, thereby leaving more money for productive capital investment and making the economy more stable. [ Wetzel Dave The case for taxing land New Statesman 2004-09-20 http://www.newstatesman.com/200409200007 2008-06-13 ] If the value to landowners were reduced to zero or near zero by recovering effectively all its rent, total privately held asset values could decline as the land value element was stripped out, representing a shift in apparent private sector wealth. Since landowners often possess significant political influence, this has significantly deterred the adoption of land value taxes. [ Julie P.

Most notably, it needs to be: Calculated fairly and accurately, High enough to raise sufficient revenue without causing land abandonment, and Billed to the correct person or business entity. [ Assessments/Appraisals ] [ Compare to Real estate appraisal ] [ Land (economics) ] In theory, levying a land value tax is straightforward, requiring only a valuation of the land and a register of the identities of the landholders. There is no need for the tax payers to deal with complicated forms or to give up personal information as with an income tax. Because land cannot be hidden, removed to a tax haven or concealed in an electronic data system, [ http://www.feasta.org/documents/landhousing/ppleaflet.pdf Land Value Tax FAQ, Feasta 2009-02-13 ] the tax cannot be evaded. However, critics point out that determining the value of land can be difficult in practice. In a 1796 United States Supreme Court opinion, Justice William Paterson noted that leaving the valuation process up to assessors would cause numerous bureaucratic complexities, as well as non-uniform assessments due to imperfect policies and their interpretations. { Hylton, 3 U.S. 171(1796) } Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard later raised similar concerns, stating that no government can fairly assess value, which can only be determined by a free market. [ http://www.mises.org/rothbard/georgism.pdf The Single Tax: Economic and Moral Implications and A Reply to Georgist Criticisms Murray Rothbard 2009-02-13 The Mises Institute ] However, as Steven Spadijer has pointed out, the free market is already determining the taxable value of the land. For example, valuators in the home and contents insurance industry are already performing such a function on a daily basis when, in order to calculate an insurance premium, the valuator must separate the value of the home from the indestructible value of the land beneath the home itself. Secondly, when compared to modern day property tax evaluations, valuations of land involve fewer variables and have smoother gradient s than valuations that include improvements. This is due to variation of building style, quality and size between lot s. Modern computerization and statistical techniques have eased the process; in the 1960s and 1970s, multivariate analysis was introduced as a method of assessing land. [ http://books.google.com/?id%3DSsizAAAAIAAJ%26amp%3Bq%3D%22Estimating%2BResidential%2BLand%2BValue%2Bby%2BMultivariate%2BAnalysis%22%2Bintitle%3A%22The%2BAssessment%2Bof%2BLand%2BValue%22%26amp%3Bdq%3D%22Estimating%2BResidential%2BLand%2BValue%2Bby%2BMultivariate%2BAnalysis%22%2Bintitle%3A%22The%2BAssessment%2Bof%2BLand%2BValue%22 Downing Paul B. &quot; Estimating Residential Land Value by Multivariate Analysis &quot; 1970 2009-02-13 Published for the Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development by the University of Wisconsin Press ] Finally, land value for LVT purposes is assessed using market evidence. Such evidence may comprise both selling prices and rentals. Where development already exists on a site, the value of the site can be discovered by various means, of which the most easily understood is the residual method: the value of the site is the total value of the property minus the depreciated value of buildings and other structures. This may explain why the system involves little fuss and relative ease in the places where it has been implemented. Usually, the valuation process commences with a measurement of the most and least valuable land within the taxation area. A few sites of intermediate value are then identified and used as &quot; landmark &quot; values. Other values are filled in between the landmark values. The data is then collated on a database and linked to a unique property reference number, [ http://www.landreg.gov.hk/en/form/property.htm Property Reference Number The Land Registry 2008-12-22 ] &quot; smoothed &quot; and mapped using a geographical information system (GIS). Thus, even if the initial valuation is difficult, once the system is in use, successive valuations become easier. [ Limited revenue ] In this case, land is taxed at 100% of its rental value, eliminating the landowner surplus completely. Land tax revenues cannot be raised beyond this point. In the context of land value taxation as a single tax (replacing all other taxes), some have argued that LVT alone cannot raise large enough revenues. { Posner, Richard A. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW 458-59 (3rd ed. 1986) } However, this is to ignore the fact that other taxes have the effect of reducing land values and hence the amount of revenue that can be raised from them. The Physiocrats argued that all taxes are ultimately at the expense of land rental values. Most modern LVT systems are alongside other taxes, and thus only reduce their impact without removing them completely. In a case or event where a jurisdiction attempted to levy a land tax that was higher than the entire landowner surplus, it would result in landowner abandonment and a sharp decline in tax revenue. { Coughlin (1999) p.265-266. } [ Requires clear ownership ] In some countries, LVT is nearly impossible to implement because of lack of certainty regarding land titles and clearly established land ownership and tenure. For instance a parcel of grazing land may be communally owned by the inhabitants of a nearby village and administered by the village elders. In these situations, the land in question would need to be vested in a trust or similar body for taxation purposes. If the government can not accurately define ownership boundaries and ascertain the proper owners, it cannot know from whom to collect the tax. The phenomenon of lack of clear titles is found worldwide in developing countries [ Mika-Petteri Törhönen Sustainable Land Tenure and Land Registration in Developing Countries, Including a Historical Comparison with an Industrialised Country Final version Elsevier Science Ltd 2003-01-15 http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512264919/article4.pdf PDF 2008-05-22 ] and is in part the subject of the work of the Peru vian economist Hernando de Soto. In African countries with imperfect land registration, boundaries may be poorly surveyed, the landlord can be elusive and would have to be identified, or made to identify himself, otherwise it would be significantly more difficult to tax than occupants. Most governments require that tax collectors track owners down nonetheless so that the burden of the tax does not fall on the poor. [ Keith Simon H.

According to proponents, [ A Study in Land Value Taxation http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/post-louis_on-land-value-taxation.html Louis F. Post The School of Cooperative Individualism 2008-11-17 ] the unimproved value of land owes nothing to the individual efforts of the landowner and everything to the community at large. These supporters suggest that the value of land belongs justly and uniquely to the community. A land value tax does take into account the effect on land value of location, or of improvements made to neighbouring land, such as proximity to roads, public works or a shopping complex. LVT is said to act as value capture tax. { Coughlin (1999), p.263 } A new public works project may make adjacent land go up considerably in value, and thus, with a tax on land values, the tax on adjacent land goes up. Thus, the new public improvements would be paid for by those most benefited by the new public improvements — those whose land value went up most. { Rick Rybeck, Using Value Capture to Finance Infrastructure and Encourage Compact Development, PUBLIC WORKS MANAGEMENT &amp; POLICY, Vol. 8 No. 4, April 2004, pp.249-260, DOI: 10.1177/1087724X03262828, © 2004 Sage Publications. http://pwm.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/4/249 } [ History ] [ Pre-modern ] [ February 2009 ] Land value taxation has ancient roots, tracing back to after the introduction of agriculture. One of the oldest forms of taxation, it was originally based on crop yield. This early version of the tax required simply sharing the yield at the time of the harvest, akin to paying a yearly rent.

[ Physiocrats ] { Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, one of the leading physiocrats. } The physiocrats were a group of economists who believed that the wealth of nations was derived solely from the value of land agriculture or land development. Physiocracy is considered one of the &quot; early modern &quot; schools of economics.

The movement was particularly dominated by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727–1781) and François Quesnay (1694–1774). { Steiner, Phillippe (2003) Physiocracy and French Pre-Classical Political Economy in eds.

Blackwell Publishing, 2003. } It immediately preceded the first modern school, classical economics, which began with the publication of Adam Smith&apos;s The Wealth of Nations in 1776. The Physiocrats were also highly influential in the early history of land value taxation in the United States. Thomas Paine contended in his Agrarian Justice pamphlet that all citizens should be paid 15 pounds at age 21 &quot; as a compensation in part for the loss of his or her natural inheritance by the introduction of the system of landed property. &quot; This proposal was the origin of the citizen&apos;s dividend advocated by Geolibertarianism. [ Classical economists ] It was Adam Smith, in his book The Wealth of Nations, who first rigorously analyzed the effects of a land value tax, pointing out how it would not hurt economic activity, and how it would not raise land rents. [ Ground-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of houses. A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses. It would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use of his ground. More or less can be got for it according as the competitors happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their fancy for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expense. In every country the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital, and it is there accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be found. As the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be increased by a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be disposed to pay more for the use of the ground. Whether the tax was to be advanced by the inhabitant, or by the owner of the ground, would be of little importance. The more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the tax, the less he would incline to pay for the ground; so that the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent.

In 1879 he authored Progress and Poverty, which significantly influenced land taxation in the United States.

The Review’s 2007 Report { IPP.org.nz } [ September 2010 ] concludes that “although land value taxation meets a number of our criteria, we question whether the public would accept the upheaval involved in radical reform of this nature, unless they could clearly understand the nature of the change and the benefits involved…. We considered at length the many positive features of a land value tax which are consistent with our recommended local property tax [LPT], particularly its progressive nature.” However, “[h] aving considered both rateable value and land value as the basis for taxation, we concur with Layfield [UK Committee of Inquiry, 1976)] who recommended that any local property tax should be based on capital values.” { see &apos;SLGFR news: a fairer way’, ‘‘Land &amp; Liberty’’, vol. 112, no. 1216, winter 2006-7 } In 2009, Glasgow City Council resolved that it wished to introduce a tax based on land values: “the idea could become the blueprint for Scotland’s future local taxation” [ Maddox David Scotland&apos;s biggest city backs plan to replace council tax The Scotsman 2009-06-26 http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/politics/Scotland39s-biggest-city-backs-plan.5404468.jp ] The Council has agreed { Glasgow.gov.uk, Print 3, 2009-10 } a “long term move to a local property tax / land value tax hybrid tax”: its Local Taxation Working Group also states that simple [non-hybrid] land value taxation should itself “not be discounted as an option for local taxation reform: it potentially holds many benefits and addresses many existing concerns”.

There are local campaigns to introduce it in many other countries, including South Korea and the United Kingdom (where a broad assembly of independent and politically-aligned groups { Many active organisations are partners in the Coalition for Economic Justice CoalitionForEconomicJustice.com } advocate and advance the case for land value taxation). { see, for instance, SquareEye.com } The IU works internationally and at the United Nations in support of the policy. In 1990, several economists wrote { Wikisource:Open letter to Mikhail Gorbachev (1990) } to then President Mikhail Gorbachev suggesting that Russia use Land Value Taxation in its transition towards a free market economy: its failure to do so has been argued as causal in the rise of the Oligarchs.
