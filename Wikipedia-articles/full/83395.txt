It is located on the Tay River, [ 83 km ] southwest of Ottawa, and is the seat of Lanark County. [ History ] The town was established as a military settlement in 1816, shortly after the War of 1812. Many of the first settlers were military veterans on half pay, while others were military veterans from France, Germany, Poland. Italy, Scotland or Ireland who were offered land in return for their service. The Rev. William Bell, who arrived in June 1817, noted in his diaries that the settlement was more European than the Scottish settlement described to him. A wave of Scottish and Irish immigrants quickly followed. Many of the Scottish immigrants were stonemason s; their work can be seen in many area buildings and in the locks of the Rideau Canal. The first secretary/stores-keeper (and eventually postmaster and superintendent) of the settlement was Daniel Daverne, brought up from the Quarter Masters General Department in Kingston, Ontario to assume these positions. Perth is home to Canada&apos;s oldest pioneer burial ground, St. Paul&apos;s United Church Cemetery, formerly The Old Methodist Burying Ground. This cemetery is at the south-east end of the Last Duel Park on Robinson Street. The Craig Street Cemetery, sometimes referred to as the &quot; Old Burying Grounds &quot; also contains many historic graves and saw use from 1820-1873. The Town&apos;s motto is &quot; Pro Rege, Lege et Grege &quot; which was adopted in 1980 along with a new crest. The previous motto, &quot; Festina lente sed certo &quot;, and original town crest appears on the uniforms of the Perth Citizen&apos;s Band. Founded in 1850, this band continues a tradition of community music with numerous concerts each season. Near the town is the home of world show jumping champion Ian Millar and Millar Brooke Farm where his great horse Big Ben (1976–1999) is buried. The town has erected a bronze life-sized statue of the horse and Ian Millar, in John A. Stewart Park, across from the Code&apos;s Mill building. This town was the site of the last fatal duel in Upper Canada. Robert Lyon, a law student, was killed on June 13, 1833 after fighting over a woman (Elizabeth Hughes) with a former friend, John Wilson. Perth is also the site of the first installation of a telephone other than Bell&apos;s experimental installations. A town dentist, Dr. J. F. Kennedy, a friend of Alexander Graham Bell, installed a direct telephone connection between his home and office. By 1887, there were 19 telephones in Perth, with a switchboard in Dr. Kennedy&apos;s office. In 2010 Perth held the historic &quot; Kilt Run &quot; in which 1067 kilt-clad runners crossed the finish line. Recently the race was recognized by the Guinness World Records as the &quot; largest run while runners are wearing kilts &quot;. Another race was run July 2, 2011 with 1094 entrants. [ http://perthkiltrun.ca The official website for the Kilt Run 2011-07-16 ] In 1893 a 22,000 pound cheese known as the &apos;Mammoth Cheese&apos; was produced in Perth to be exhibited in Chicago at the World&apos;s Columbian Exposition to promote Canadian Cheese around the world.. { See a history of the mammoth cheese.

Most of these operate out of the century old stone buildings in town. The drugstore on Foster Street in the downtown core (now called Perth Pharmasave, formerly Girdwood&apos;s Drug Store) is the oldest continually operating pharmacy in Canada. The Perth Courier is the second-oldest weekly newspaper in Canada. It was independently owned for 155 years until sold in 2006 to a larger publisher. The Links O&apos;Tay Golf course, walking distance from the downtown core, began its trek through golfing history in 1890 and is now Canada&apos;s oldest continuously operating golf course. The Perth Citizens Band, still giving concerts on the band stand behind City Hall, is a tradition dating back over 150 years. The band is Canada&apos;s oldest active town band. The Perth Citizens Band played &quot; The Maple Leaf Forever &quot; as the Mammoth Cheese departed to the Chicago World&apos;s Fair in 1893. The bandstand has been behind the Town Hall since it was moved there in 1901 and free summer concerts have taken place there ever since. An interesting feature of the downtown core is the Crystal Palace, constructed from the discarded remnants of the glass street enclosures that used to be on Rideau Street in nearby Ottawa. This structure houses the Perth Farmers&apos; and Craft Markets on summer Saturdays. Perth is also home to the summer theatre company, the Classic Theatre Festival (www.classictheatre.ca), presenting classic hits from the Golden Age of Broadway and the London Stage at the centrally located Studio Theatre. An interactive GIS Map of the town of Perth is available on the Town of Perth Site: GIS Map of Perth The Tay River splits into two main channels for much of its course through Perth. Much of downtown Perth, including the town hall, are on the island formed by the two channels.
