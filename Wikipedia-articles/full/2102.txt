They are currently members of the Western Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Cardinals were founded in 1898, and are the oldest continuously run professional American football club in the United States. { Arizona Cardinals team history, azcardinals.com } The team was established in Chicago in 1898 and was a charter member of the NFL in [ 1920 ]. Along with the Chicago Bears, the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in operation since the league&apos;s founding. (The Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). The club moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in [ 1960 ] and played in that city through [ 1987 ] (sometimes referred to as the &quot; Football Cardinals &quot; and / or the &quot; Big Red &quot; to avoid confusion with the Major League Baseball St. Louis Cardinals ). Other less commonly used nicknames were the &quot; Gridbirds &quot; (used only by a local newspaper columnist) or &quot; Cardiac Cards &quot; (used only to refer to the 1975 team ). Before the 1988 NFL season, the team moved to Tempe, Arizona, a college town suburb of Phoenix, and played their home games for the next 18 years at Arizona State University &apos;s Sun Devil Stadium. In [ 2006 ], the club began playing all home games at the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium in the northwestern suburb of Glendale. The franchise has two NFL championships, both while it was based in Chicago. The first occurred in [ 1925 ], but is the subject of controversy, with supporters of the Pottsville Maroons believing that Pottsville should have gotten the title. Their second title, and the first to be received through a championship game, came in [ 1947 ], two decades before the first Super Bowl game was played. In the six-plus decades since winning the championship in 1947, the team suffered many losing seasons. They have been to the playoffs six times and have won six playoff games, three of which were victories during their run in the 2008-09 NFL Playoffs. During that season, they reached Super Bowl XLIII. The team has also won four division titles ( [ 1974 ], [ 1975 ], [ 2008 ], and [ 2009 ] ) since their 1947 –1948 NFL championship game appearances. In addition, the club won one NFC Championship Game in 2008. The Cardinals conduct their annual summer training camp at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. [ Franchise history ] [ History of the Arizona Cardinals ] [ Logo and uniforms ] { Phoenix Cardinals uniform: 1989 –1995 } Arizona Cardinals uniform: 1996 –2004 The team has used cardinal red jerseys since Chris O&apos;Brien bought them for the club in 1898. For most of their history, the Cardinals have used the same basic uniform design of white helmets, white pants with red stripes on the sides, and either red or white jerseys. Chicago Cardinals logo. Starting in [ 1947 ], the team had a logo of a cardinal bird perched on the stitches of a football. However, the club did not attach a logo to their helmets until they debuted a cardinal-head logo in [ 1960 ], the year the franchise moved from Chicago to St. Louis. The Cardinals moved to Arizona in [ 1988 ], and the flag of Arizona was added to the sleeves the following year. In [ 1990 ], the team began wearing red pants with their white jerseys. In [ 1994 ], the Cardinals participated in the NFL&apos;s 75th anniversary throwback uniform program. The jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s Chicago Cardinals, with an interlocking &quot; CC &quot; logo and three stripes on each sleeve. The uniform numbers were relocated to the right chest. The pants were khaki to simulate the color and material used in that era. The Cardinals also stripped the logos from their helmets for the two games, at Cleveland (Sept. 18) and home vs. Pittsburgh (Oct. 30). In [ 2005 ], the team unveiled its first major changes in a century. The cardinal-head logo was updated to be a more aggressive version of its predecessor, making it look meaner. Numerous fans had called the previous version a &quot; parakeet &quot;. { &quot; Arizona brushes up logo of outdated bird &quot;, MSNBC.com January 29, 2005 } Black again became an accent color after an eight-year absence, while trim lines were added to the outside shoulders, sleeves, and sides of the jerseys and pants. Both the red and white jerseys have the option of red or white pants. Hoping to break a six-game losing streak, the Cardinals wore the red pants for the first time on October 29, 2006, in a game at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay Packers. The Packers won 31 –14, and the Cards headed into their bye week with a 1 –7 mark. Following the bye week, the Cardinals came out in an all-red combination at home against the Dallas Cowboys and lost, 27 –10. Arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and won four of their last seven games. However, the following season, in [ 2007 ], the Cardinals again wore their red pants for their final 3 home games. They wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks. They paired red pants with red jerseys, the all-red combination, for home games against the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, and St. Louis Rams. The red pants were not worn at all in [ 2008 ], but they were used in home games vs. Seattle, Minnesota, and St. Louis in [ 2009 ]. They have yet to be paired with the white road jerseys since the 2007 game at Seattle. The Cardinals&apos; first home game in Arizona, in 1988, saw them play in red jerseys. Thereafter, for the next 18 years in Arizona, the Cardinals, like a few other NFL teams in warm climates, wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season —forcing opponents to suffer in darker-colored jerseys during Arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C). However, this tradition did not continue when the Cardinals moved from Sun Devil Stadium to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006, as early-season games (and some home games late in the season) were played with the roof closed. With the temperature inside at a comfortable 70°F (21°C), the team opted wear red jerseys at home full-time. The Cardinals wore white jerseys at home for the first time in University of Phoenix Stadium on August 29, 2008, in a preseason game against the Denver Broncos. The Cardinals wore white at home for the first time in a regular season game at University of Phoenix Stadium against the Houston Texans on October 11, [ 2009 ]. In October 2009, the NFL recognized Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and players wore pink-accented items, including gloves, wristbands, and shoes. The team thought the pink accents looked better with white uniforms than with red. { http://www.azcentral.com/members/Blog/KentSomers/66308 } The [ 2010 ] season saw the Cardinals debut a new, alternate black jersey. Prior to its introduction, the Cardinals were the only NFL team without an alternate jersey or throwback kit, save for the NFL&apos;s 75th anniversary program in 1994.
