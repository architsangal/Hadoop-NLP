The islands are geographically part of the Virgin Islands archipelago and are located in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles. The U.S. Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of Saint Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas, along with the much smaller but historically distinct Water Island, and many other surrounding minor islands. The total land area of the territory is [ 133.73 sqmi ]. [ https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vq.html CIA - The World Factbook-US Virgin Islands 2012-03-25 ] As of the 2000 census the population was 108,612, { 2000 Population Counts for the U.S. Virgin Islands, U.S. Census Bureau. } mostly composed by those of Afro-Caribbean descent. Tourism is the primary economic activity, although there is a significant manufacturing sector. Formerly the Danish West Indies, they were sold to the United States by Denmark in the Treaty of the Danish West Indies of 1916. They are classified by the UN as a Non-Self-Governing Territory, and are currently an organized, unincorporated United States territory. The U.S. Virgin Islands are organized under the Revised Organic Act of 1954, and have since held five constitutional conventions. The last and only proposed Constitution adopted by the Fifth Constitutional Convention in 2009 was rejected by the U.S. Congress in 2010, which urged the convention to reconvene to address the concerns Congress has had with the proposed document. [ History ] [ History of the United States Virgin Islands ] The Virgin Islands were originally inhabited by the Ciboney, Carib, and Arawak s. The islands were named by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over the next two hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark-Norway. The Danish West India Company settled on Saint Thomas in 1672, on Saint John in 1694, and purchased Saint Croix from France in 1733. [ April 2010 ] The islands became royal Danish colonies in 1754, named the Danish-Westindian islands ( [ De dansk-vestindiske øer ] ). { Danish Wikipedia entry. } Sugarcane, produced by slave labor, drove the islands&apos; economy during the 18th and early 19th centuries, until the abolition of slavery by Governor Peter von Scholten on July 3, 1848. For the remainder of the period of Danish rule, the islands were not economically viable and significant transfers were made from the Danish state budgets to the authorities in the islands. In 1867 a treaty to sell Saint Thomas and Saint John to the United States was agreed, but the sale was never effected. { A Brief History of the Danish West Indies, 1666–1917, Danish National Archives } A number of reforms aimed at reviving the islands&apos; economy were attempted, but none had great success. A second draft treaty to sell the islands to the United States was negotiated in 1902 but was narrowly defeated in the Danish parliament. The onset of World War I brought the reforms to a close and again left the islands isolated and exposed. During the submarine warfare phases of the First World War, the United States, fearing that the islands might be seized by Germany as a submarine base, again approached Denmark with a view to buying them. After a few months of negotiations, a selling price of $25  million (This is equivalent to $ [ US 25000000 1917 2010 -6 ] in 2010 dollars [ US ] ) was agreed. [ December 2008 ] At the same time the economics of continued possession weighed heavily on the minds of Danish decision makers, and a bipartisan consensus in favor of selling emerged in the Danish parliament. The Treaty of the Danish West Indies was signed in August 1916, { Convention between the United States and Denmark for cession of the Danish West Indies, } [ 39 1706 ] with a Danish referendum held in December 1916 to confirm the decision. The deal was finalized on January 17, 1917, when the United States and Denmark exchanged their respective treaty ratifications. The United States took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 and the territory was renamed the Virgin Islands of the United States. [ April 2010 ] U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927. The aftermath of Hurricane Marilyn, 1995 [ Effects of Hurricane Marilyn in the US Virgin Islands ] Water Island, a small island to the south of Saint Thomas, was initially administered by the U.S. federal government and did not become a part of the U.S. Virgin Islands territory until 1996, when [ 50 acre m2 ] of land was transferred to the territorial government. The remaining [ 200 acre ha ] of the island were purchased from the U.S. Department of the Interior in May 2005 for $10, a transaction which marked the official change in jurisdiction. { Poinski, Megan. &quot; Water Island appears frozen in time, but big plans run under the surface – V.I. says land acquired from the feds is about to undergo large-scale improvements &quot;. The Virgin Islands Daily News, November 18, 2005, online edition. Retrieved September 6, 2007. } Hurricane Marilyn struck the Virgin islands in 1995, killing eight people and causing more than $2 billion in damages. [ Geography ] [ Geography of the United States Virgin Islands ] [ January 2012 ] Map of the US Virgin Islands The U.S. Virgin Islands are in the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, about [ 40 mi km ] east of Puerto Rico and immediately west of the British Virgin Islands. The territory consists of four main islands: Saint Thomas, Saint John, Saint Croix, and Water Island, as well as several dozen smaller islands. The main islands have nicknames often used by locals: &quot; Twin City &quot; (St. Croix), &quot; Rock City &quot; (St. Thomas) and &quot; Love City &quot; (St. John). [ CANOE.ca Slawych Diane Love is in the air January 25, 2008 http://travel.canoe.ca/Travel/Activities/Romantic/2004/02/11/343943.html ] The combined land area of the islands is roughly twice the size of Washington, D.C. The U.S. Virgin Islands are known for their white sand beaches, including Magens Bay and Trunk Bay, and strategic harbors, including Charlotte Amalie and Christiansted. Most of the islands, including Saint Thomas, are volcanic in origin and hilly. The highest point is Crown Mountain, Saint Thomas ( [ 1555 ft m 0 s on ] ). Saint Croix, the largest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, lies to the south and has a flatter terrain. The National Park Service owns more than half of Saint John, nearly all of Hassel Island, and many acres of coral reef. (See also Virgin Islands National Park, Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, Buck Island Reef National Monument, Christiansted National Historic Site, and Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve.) The U.S. Virgin Islands lie on the boundary of the North American plate and the Caribbean Plate. Natural hazards include earthquake s and tropical cyclone s (including hurricanes).

Even though they are U.S. citizens, U.S. Virgin Islands residents cannot vote in presidential elections. U.S. Virgin Islands residents, however, are able to vote in presidential primary elections for delegates to the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention. The main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the Independent Citizens Movement, and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Additional candidates run as independents. At the national level, the U.S. Virgin Islands elect a delegate to Congress from their at-large [ United States Virgin Islands AL congressional district ]. However, the elected delegate, while able to vote in committee, cannot participate in floor votes. The current House of Representatives delegate is Donna Christensen (D). At the territorial level, 15 senators – seven from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large who must be a resident of Saint John – are elected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature. The U.S. Virgin Islands have elected a territorial governor every four years since 1970. Previous governors were appointed by the President of the United States. The U.S. Virgin Islands have a District Court, Superior Court and the Supreme Court. The District Court is responsible for federal law, while the Superior Court is responsible for U.S. Virgin Islands law at the trial level and the Supreme Court is responsible for appeals from the Superior Court for all appeals filed on or after January 29, 2007. Appeals filed prior to that date are heard by the Appellate Division of the District Court. Appeals from the federal District Court are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. District Court judges are appointed by the President, while Superior Court and Supreme Court judges are appointed by the Governor. [ Self-determination ] The U.S. Virgin Islands are on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. A 1993 referendum on status attracted only 31.4% turnout, and so its results (in favor of the status quo) were considered void. No further referenda have been scheduled since. In 2004, the 25th legislature established the Fifth Constitutional Convention. In June 2009, Governor John deJongh, Jr. rejected the resulting draft constitution, saying that the document &quot; violates federal law, fails to defer to federal sovereignty and disregards basic civil rights &quot;. { Poinski, Megan, &quot; Governor Rejects Constitution Draft &quot;, article in &apos;&apos; } { The Virgin Islands Daily News, June 13, 2009. Retrieved July 29, 2009. } However, a lawsuit filed by members of the Fifth Constitutional Convention to force Governor deJongh to forward the document to President Barack Obama was ultimately successful. The president forwarded the proposal to Congress – which then had 60 days to approve or reject the document – in May 2010, along with a report noting concerns raised by the Justice Department and restating the issues noted by Governor deJongh. A Congressional resolution disapproving of the proposed constitution and requesting that the Fifth Constitutional Convention reconvene to consider changes to address these issues was signed into law by President Obama on June 30, 2010.

The case is Civil No. 3:11-cv-110, Charles v. U.S. Federal Elections Commission. [ January 2012 ] The case alleges it was racial discrimination present in an all-white and segregated Congress of 1917 that was the impetus to deny the right to vote to a majority non-white constituency. [ Economy ] [ Economy of the United States Virgin Islands ] [ April 2010 ] { Magens Bay, } { St. Thomas. } Tourism is the primary economic activity. The islands normally host 2  million visitors a year, many of whom visit on cruise ship s. The manufacturing sector consists of petroleum refining, textiles, electronics, rum distilling, pharmaceuticals, and watch assembly. The agricultural sector is small, with most food being imported. International business and financial services are a small but growing component of the economy. Most energy is also generated from imported oil, leading to electricity costs four to five times higher than the U.S. mainland. { http://cleantechnica.com/2012/02/19/us-virgin-islands-launches-15-year-energy-initiative-to-reduce-fossil-fuel-use-60/ } The Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority { http://www.viwapa.vi } also uses imported energy to operate its desalination facilities to provide fresh water. Until February 2012, the Hovensa plant located on St. Croix was one of the world&apos;s largest petroleum refineries, and contributed about 20% of the territory&apos;s GDP. It largely shut down and is being operated as an oil storage facility, provoking a local economic crisis. { http://virginislandsdailynews.com/news/hovensa-closing-1.1259790#axzz1nXpo7wFr } { http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120222-714220.html } The U.S. Virgin Islands are located in the Atlantic Standard Time zone and do not participate in daylight saving time. When the mainland United States is on Standard Time, the U.S. Virgin Islands are one hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time. When the mainland United States is on daylight saving time, Eastern Daylight Time is the same as Atlantic Standard Time. To draw more technology-focused companies and expand this segment of the economy, the government founded and launched University of the Virgin Islands Research and Technology Park in conjunction with private businesses and the University of the Virgin Islands. The U.S. Virgin Islands are an independent customs territory from the mainland United States, but operate largely as a free port. U.S. citizens thus do not have to clear customs when arriving, but do when returning to the mainland.

The racial makeup of the territory as of 2010, was: Black or Afro-Caribbean : 79.7% White : 7.1% Asian: 0.5% Mixed or Other: 12.7% Hispanics of any race represent 22.3% of the total population. Of the Hispanic community, 57% were racially mixed, 27% were black, and 16% were white. The Hispanic population is predominantly of Puerto Rican descent, while Dominicans make up most of the remainder. Many residents can trace their ancestry to other Caribbean islands, especially Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles. The territory is largely Afro-Caribbean in origin. There were 40,648 households out of which 34.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 33.2% were married couples living together, 24.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.5% were non-families. 30.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.34. In the territory the population was spread out with 31.6% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 27.1% from 25 to 44, 24.9% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.7 males. The annual population growth is −0.12%. The median income for a household in the territory was $24,704, and the median income for a family was $28,553. Males had a median income of $28,309 versus $22,601 for females.

About 28.7% of families and 32.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 41.7% of those under age 18 and 29.8% of those age 65 or over. [ Ethnicity ] Most U.S. Virgin Islanders descend from Africans, who were enslaved and brought to the Caribbean by Europeans to labor on sugar plantations. Most of the residents were born in the islands, although many migrated to the U.S. Virgin Islands from other islands in the West Indies, the United States and other countries. [ Language ] The official language is English, although Virgin Islands Creole, an English-based dialect, is spoken in informal situations. The Virgin Islands Creole spoken on St. Croix, known as Crucian, is slightly different from that spoken on St. Thomas and St. John. Because the U.S. Virgin Islands are home to thousands of immigrants from across the Caribbean, Spanish and various French creole languages are also widely spoken. As of the 2000 census, 25.3% of persons over the age of five speak a language other than English at home. { Detailed Tables – American FactFinder } { United States Census Bureau Retrieved January 11, 2011. } [ Religion ] As in most Caribbean countries, Christianity is the dominant religion in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
