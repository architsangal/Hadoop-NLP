Maier. Inspired by his visit to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, Maier envisioned a similar ethnic-themed festival in Milwaukee, and in 1962 formed a panel of business and civic leaders to study the feasibility of a large-scale summer festival. By the middle of the decade, the panel drew up a proposal for a 10-day multi-event festival with the proposed name of &quot; Milwaukee World Festival, &quot; which was changed briefly in 1966 to &quot; Juli Spaß &quot; (German for &quot; July Fun &quot; ) and then to &quot; Summerfest &quot;. [ May 2012 ] The inaugural Summerfest was held in July 1968 at 35 different locations throughout the city (including Milwaukee County Stadium and Milwaukee Arena ), and its events ranged from concerts to a film festival, an air show, and even a pageant. The first Summerfest was regarded as a success; the second event in 1969, was less successful, as it was plagued by additional venues, inclement weather, and severe financial debt. In 1970, a permanent central location was decided upon, and Summerfest moved to a former Nike missile site on the lakefront, where it continues to be held to this day. Also that year, Summerfest introduced its red &quot; smiley face &quot; logo, an insignia that has become synonymous with the event. The logo was designed by local graphic artist Noel Spangler. [ May 2012 ] It was also in 1970 that Henry Jordan became executive director of Summerfest, a title he held during the event&apos;s early years until his death in 1977. Another public face in that position was Elizabeth &quot; Bo &quot; Black, { http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=568531 } who became executive director in 1984. Through her fundraising and organizing, she became a local celebrity (and almost as much a recognizable part of Summerfest as the smiley face logo) until her departure in September 2003. [ http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20030913/ai_n10907152 ] [ October 2010 RjwilmsiBot ] Summerfest celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007. The event&apos;s history was the subject of &quot; Summerfest Stories &quot;, a documentary that aired in June 2007 on Milwaukee Public Television. { http://www.mptv.org/insidemptv/news/detail.php?n=185 } [ New stages ] Harley-Davidson teamed up with Summerfest to completely renovate their stage and area footprint for the 2008 festival season. The renovation improved sight lines, sound and lighting, while also increasing the area&apos;s capacity and providing for improved traffic flow in and around the stage area. Upgrades included large video screens for image magnification of performances and a comfortable seating area at the lakefront. { http://www.summerfest.com/history/harley-davidson.cfm } In 2011, a renovated Briggs &amp; Stratton Big Backyard stage opened. [ May 2012 ] [ Concert history ] Summerfest has been most famous for its music, ever since the first festival in 1968, when acts such as Ronnie Dove, The New Colony Six, and Up With People performed. In 1969, Led Zeppelin performed (see Midwest Rock Festival ). Since then, musical acts from Bob Dylan, The Jonas Brothers, Tina Turner, and James Taylor to Christina Aguilera, Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Mary J. Blige, Wiz Khalifa, and Nine Inch Nails have graced the Summerfest stages. Acts with Milwaukee and Wisconsin connections have had a prominent history at Summerfest, most notably the BoDeans, The Gufs, Danny Gokey, and Violent Femmes. [ May 2012 ] The concerts have been mostly civil events, with two notable exceptions. In 1970, a performance by the late-arriving Sly &amp; the Family Stone nearly resulted in a riot. In 1973, a performance by Humble Pie &amp; the Blackberries resulted in a riot, a bonfire, and about 300 arrests. As a result of the latter concert, organizers shied away from rock bands for several years, and established guidelines for &quot; family-friendly &quot; acts and a ban on alcohol brought in by patrons.

Sandra Bernhard did TV and radio promos for its 1986 season when she was a performer there. Lewis Black has become a frequent performer at Summerfest, making near-annual performances since his first appearance in 1991.

Some of these events include Polish Fest, Festa Italiana, German Fest, African World Festival, Irish Fest, Mexican Fiesta, Indian Summer, Asian Moon Festival, Arab World Fest, PrideFest, and several run/walk charity events. [ May 2012 ] [ Winterfest ] 1997-1998 web banner for Winterfest Beginning in the winter of 1989-1990, Summerfest organizers staged a colder (in the literal sense) version of Summerfest, known as Winterfest. Rather than being chiefly set at Henry Maier Festival Park, the event took inspiration from Summerfest&apos;s early days and spread its music, comedy, and other events throughout several downtown Milwaukee locations, the central spot being an ice skating rink near Cathedral Square. Winterfest was never as profitable as its older summer counterpart, and ceased operations after the 1997-98 event.
