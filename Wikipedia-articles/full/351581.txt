[ October 2010 ]. Electronic patient chart from a health information system Health informatics (also called Health Information Systems,health care informatics, healthcare informatics, medical informatics, nursing informatics, clinical informatics, or biomedical informatics) is a discipline at the intersection of information science, computer science, and health care. It deals with the resources, devices, and methods required to optimize the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health and biomedicine. Health informatics tools include not only computers but also clinical guidelines, formal medical terminologies, and information and communication systems. It is applied to the areas of nursing, clinical care, dentistry, pharmacy, public health, occupational therapy, and (bio)medical research.

Molecular bioinformatics and clinical informatics have converged into the field of translational bioinformatics. [ History ] World wide use of computer technology in medicine began in the early 1950s with the rise of the computers. In 1949, Gustav Wager established the first professional organization for informatics in Germany.

K. 2009 The engines of Hippocrates: From the Dawn of Medicine to Medical and Pharmaceutical Informatics Hoboken, NJ John Wiley &amp; Sons 978-0-470-28953-2 ] Specialized university departments and Informatics training programs began during the 1960s in France, Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands. Medical informatics research units began to appear during the 1970s in Poland and in the U.S. Since then the development of high-quality health informatics research, education and infrastructure has been the goal of the U.S. and the European Union. Early names for health informatics included medical computing, biomedical computing, medical computer science, computer medicine, medical electronic data processing, medical automatic data processing, medical information processing, medical information science, medical software engineering, and medical computer technology. [ October 2010 ] The health informatics community is still growing, it is by no means a mature profession, but work in the UK by the voluntary registration body, the UK Council of Health Informatics Professions has suggested eight key constituencies within the domain - information management, knowledge management, portfolio/programme/project management, ICT, education and research, clinical informatics, health records(service and business-related), health informatics service management. These constituencies accommodate professionals in and for the NHS, in academia and commercial service and solution providers. Since the 1970s the most prominent international coordinating body has been the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). [ Haux Reinhold Medical informatics: Past, present, future international journal of medical informatics 2010 79 599–610 ] [ Medical informatics in the United States ] Even though the idea of using computers in medicine emerged as technology advanced in the early twentieth century, it was not until the 1950s that informatics began to make a significant impact in the United States. [ http://healthinformatics.uic.edu/history-of-health-informatics The History of Health Informatics Health Informatics, Nursing Informatics and Health Information Management Degrees University of Illinois at Chicago ] The earliest use of electronic digital computers for medicine was for dental projects in the 1950s at the United States National Bureau of Standards by Robert Ledley. [ Sittig DF, Ash JS, Ledley RS The story behind the development of the first whole-body computerized tomography scanner as told by Robert S.

[ November Joseph Biomedical Computing: Digitizing Life in the United States Baltimore Johns Hopkins University Press 2012 1421404680 ] In 1959, Ledley and Lee B. Lusted published “Reasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis,” a widely-read article in Science, which introduced computing (especially operations research) techniques to medical workers. Ledley and Lusted’s article has remained influential for decades, especially within the field of medical decision making. [ Pyle Kathryn I. Lobel Robert W. Beck J.Robert Citation Analysis of the Field of Medical Decision Making Medical Decision Making 8 155-164 1988 10.1177/0272989X8800800302 http://mdm.sagepub.com/content/8/3/155 ] Guided by Ledley&apos;s late 1950s survey of computer use in biology and medicine (carried out for the NAS-NRC), and by his and Lusted&apos;s articles, the NIH undertook the first major effort to introduce computers to biology and medicine. This effort, carried out initially by the NIH&apos;s Advisory Committee on Computers in Research (ACCR), chaired by Lusted, spent over $40 million between 1960 and 1964 in order to establish dozens of large and small biomedical research centers in the US. The next step in the mid-1960s were the development (sponsored largely by the NIH) of expert systems such as MYCIN and Internist-I. In 1965, the National Library of Medicine started to use MEDLINE and MEDLARS. Around this time, Neil Pappalardo, Curtis Marble, and Robert Greenes developed MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System) in Octo Barnett &apos;s Laboratory of Computer Science { MGH - Laboratory of Computer Science } at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, another center of biomedical computing that received significant support from the NIH. [ 161 Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology Edwin D. Reilly 2003 978-1-57356-521-9 Greenwood Press ] In the 1970s and 1980s it was the most commonly used programming language for clinical applications. The MUMPS operating system was used to support MUMPS language specifications. [ 2004 ], a descendent of this system is being used in the United States Veterans Affairs hospital system. The VA has the largest enterprise-wide health information system that includes an electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). A graphical user interface known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient’s electronic medical record at any of the VA&apos;s over 1,000 health care facilities. During the 1960s, Morris Collen, a physician working for Kaiser Permanente &apos;s Division of Research, developed computerized systems to automate many aspects of multiphasic health checkups. These system became the basis the larger medical databases Kaiser Permanente developed during the 1970s and 1980s. [ Collen Morris F. A History of Medical Informatics in the United States, 1950 to 1990 Bethesda, MD American Medical Informatics Association 0964774305 ] The American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) has since 1993 annually bestowed the Morris F. Collen, MD Medal for Outstanding Contributions to the Field of Medical Informatics. [ Dr. Morris Collen Tribute Kaiser Permanente 2008 http://www.dor.kaiser.org/external/DORExternal/research_report/collen_tribute.aspx May 21, 2012 ] In the 1970s a growing number of commercial vendors began to market practice management and electronic medical records systems. Although many products exist, only a small number of health practitioners use fully featured electronic health care records systems. Homer R. Warner, one of the fathers of medical informatics, [ Patton GA, Gardner RM Medical informatics education: the University of Utah experience Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 6 6 457–65 1999 10579604 61389 ] founded the Department of Medical Informatics at the University of Utah in 1968. The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) has an award named after him on application of informatics to medicine. [ Medical informatics in the UK ] The broad history of health informatics has been captured in the book UK Health Computing : Recollections and reflections, Hayes G, Barnett D (Eds.), BCS (May 2008) by those active in the field, predominantly members of BCS Health and its constituent groups. The book describes the path taken as ‘early development of health informatics was unorganized and idiosyncratic’. In the early -1950s it was prompted by those involved in NHS finance and only in the early 1960s did solutions including those in pathology (1960), radiotherapy (1962), immunization (1963), and primary care (1968) emerge. Many of these solutions, even in the early 1970s were developed in-house by pioneers in the field to meet their own requirements. In part this was due to some areas of health services (for example the immunization and vaccination of children) still being provided by Local Authorities. Interesting, this is a situation which the coalition government propose broadly to return to in the 2010 strategy Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS (July 2010); stating: &quot; We will put patients at the heart of the NHS, through an information revolution and greater choice and control’ with shared decision-making becoming the norm: ‘no decision about me without me’ and patients having accessto the information they want, to make choices about their care. They will have increased control over their own care records. &quot; These types of statements present a significant opportunity for health informaticians to come out of the back-office and take up a front-line role supporting clinical practice, and the business of care delivery.The UK health informatics community has long played a key role in international activity, joining TC4 of the International Federation of Information Processing (1969) which became IMIA (1979). Under the aegis of BCS Health, Cambridge was the host for the first EFMI Medical Informatics Europe (1974) conference and London was the location for IMIA’s tenth global congress (MEDINFO2001). [ Current state of health informatics and policy initiatives ] [ August 2009 ] [ Americas ] [ Argentina ] Since 1997, the Buenos Aires Biomedical Informatics Group, a nonprofit group, represents the interests of a broad range of clinical and non-clinical professionals working within the Health Informatics sphere.Its purposes are: Promote the implementation of the computer tool in the healthcare activity, scientific research, health administration and in all areas related to health sciences and biomedical research. Support, promote and disseminate content related activities with the management of health information and tools they used to do under the name of Biomedical informatics. Promote cooperation and exchange of actions generated in the field of biomedical informatics, both in the public and private, national and international level. Interact with all scientists, recognized academic stimulating the creation of new instances that have the same goal and be inspired by the same purpose. To promote, organize, sponsor and participate in events and activities for training in computer and information and disseminating developments in this area that might be useful for team members and health related activities. The Argentinian health system is very heterogeneous, because of that the informatics developments show a heterogeneous stage. Lots of private Health Care center have developed systems, such as the German Hospital of Buenos Aires, which was one of the first in developing an electronic health records system. [ Brazil ] [ Brazilian Society of Health Informatics ] The first applications of computers to medicine and healthcare in Brazil started around 1968, with the installation of the first mainframes in public university hospitals, and the use of programmable calculators in scientific research applications. Minicomputers, such as the IBM 1130 were installed in several universities, and the first applications were developed for them, such as the hospital census in the School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto and patient master files, in the Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo, respectively at the cities of Ribeirão Preto and São Paulo campi of the University of São Paulo. In the 1970s, several Digital Corporation and Hewlett Packard minicomputers were acquired for public and Armed Forces hospitals, and more intensively used for intensive-care unit, cardiology diagnostics, patient monitoring and other applications. In the early 1980s, with the arrival of cheaper microcomputer s, a great upsurge of computer applications in health ensued, and in 1986 the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics was founded, the first Brazilian Congress of Health Informatics was held, and the first Brazilian Journal of Health Informatics was published. In Brazil, two universities are pioneers in teaching and research in Medical Informatics, both the University of Sao Paulo and the Federal University of Sao Paulo offer undergraduate programs highly qualified in the area as well as extensive graduate programs (MSc and PhD) [ Canada ] Health Informatics projects in Canada are implemented provincially, with different provinces creating different systems. A national, federally-funded, not-for-profit organization called Canada Health Infoway was created in 2001 to foster the development and adoption of electronic health records across Canada. As of December 31, 2008 there were 276 EHR projects under way in Canadian hospitals, other health-care facilities, pharmacies and laboratories, with an investment value of $1.5-billion from Canada Health Infoway.

It has been plagued by delays and its CEO was fired over a multimillion-dollar contracts scandal in 2009. Alberta Netcare was created in 2003 by the Government of Alberta. Today the netCARE portal is used daily by thousands of clinicians. It provides access to demographic data, prescribed/dispensed drugs, known allergies/intolerances, immunizations, laboratory test results, diagnostic imaging reports, the diabetes registry and other medical reports. netCARE interface capabilities are being included in electronic medical record products which are being funded by the provincial government. [ United States ] In 2004 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) formed the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT). The mission of this office is widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) in the US within 10 years. See quality improvement organizations for more information on federal initiatives in this area. The Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT), a private nonprofit group, was funded in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a set of standards for electronic health record s (EHR) and supporting networks, and certify vendors who meet them. In July, 2006 CCHIT released its first list of 22 certified ambulatory EHR products, in two different announcements. { Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (July 18, 2006): CCHIT Announces First Certified Electronic Health Record Products. Retrieved July 26, 2006. } [ Europe ] [ European Federation for Medical Informatics ] The European Union&apos;s Member States are committed to sharing their best practices and experiences to create a European eHealth Area, thereby improving access to and quality health care at the same time as stimulating growth in a promising new industrial sector. The European eHealth Action Plan plays a fundamental role in the European Union&apos;s strategy. Work on this initiative involves a collaborative approach among several parts of the Commission services. { European eHealth Action Plan } { European eHealth Action Plan i2010 } The European Institute for Health Records is involved in the promotion of high quality electronic health record systems in the European Union. [ Electronic Health Records for Europe 2005 http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Telemedicine_Alliance/SEMWC7SMD6E_0.html European Space Agency 2009-01-13 ] [ UK ] There are different models of health informatics delivery in each of the home countries (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) but some bodies like UKCHIP (see below) operate for those &apos;in and for&apos; all the home countries and beyond. [ England ] The NHS in England has contracted out to several vendors for a national health informatics system &apos;NPFIT&apos; that originally divided the country into five regions and is to be united by a central electronic medical record system nicknamed &quot; the spine &quot;.[16] The project, in 2010, is seriously behind schedule and its scope and design are being revised in real time. In 2010 a wide consultation was launched as part of a wider ‘Liberating the NHS’ plan. Many organisations and bodies (look on their own websites, as most have made their responses public in detail for information) responded to the consultation and a new strategy is expected in the second quarter of 2011. The degree of computerisation in NHS secondary care was quite high before NPfIT and that programme has had the unfortunate effect of largely stalling further development of the installed base.Almost all general practices in England and Wales are computerised and patients have relatively extensive computerised primary care clinical records. Computerisation is the responsibility of individual practices and there is no single, standardised GP system. Interoperation between primary and secondary care systems is rather primitive. A focus on interworking (for interfacing and integration) standards is hoped will stimulate synergy between primary and secondary care in sharing necessary information to support the care of individuals.Scotland has an approach to central connection under way which is more advanced than the English one in some ways. Scotland has the GPASS system whose source code is owned by the State, and controlled and developed by NHS Scotland. GPASS was accepted in 1984. It has been provided free to all GPs in Scotland but has developed poorly. [ September 2011 ] Discussion of open sourcing it as a remedy is occurring. = [ Emerging Direction (European R &amp; amp;D) ] The European Commission&apos;s preference, as exemplified in the 5th Framework { Cordis FP5web } as well as currently pursued pilot projects, { European Patient Smart Open Services } is for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) for healthcare. [ Asia and Oceania ] In Asia and Australia-New Zealand, the regional group called the Asia Pacific Association for Medical Informatics (APAMI) [ http://www.apami.org Asia Pacific Association of Medical Informatics ] was established in 1994 and now consists of more than 15 member regions in the Asia Pacific Region.

[ China ] [ Health informatics in China ] [ Hong Kong ] In Hong Kong a computerized patient record system called the Clinical Management System (CMS) has been developed by the Hospital Authority since 1994. This system has been deployed at all the sites of the Authority (40 hospitals and 120 clinics), and is used by all 30,000 clinical staff on a daily basis, with a daily transaction of up to 2 millions. The comprehensive records of 7 million patients are available on-line in the Electronic Patient Record (ePR), with data integrated from all sites. Since 2004 radiology image viewing has been added to the ePR, with radiography images from any HA site being available as part of the ePR. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority placed particular attention to the governance of clinical systems development, with input from hundreds of clinicians being incorporated through a structured process. The Health Informatics Section in Hong Kong Hospital Authority { Health Informatics Section in Hong Kong Hospital Authority } has close relationship with Information Technology Department and clinicians to develop healthcare systems for the organization to support the service to all public hospitals and clinics in the region. The Hong Kong Society of Medical Informatics (HKSMI) was established in 1987 to promote the use of information technology in healthcare.

It addresses the privacy, ethical and operational issues that invariably arise when electronic tools, information and media are used in health care delivery. Health Informatics Law also applies to all matters that involve information technology, health care and the interaction of information. It deals with the circumstances under which data and records are shared with other fields or areas that support and enhance patient care. [ Clinical Informatics ] Clinical Informatics is concerned with the use of information in health care by clinicians. [ Gardner RM, Overhage JM, Steen EB, et al.

Computational health informatics is also a branch of Health Informatics, but is orthogonal to much of the work going on in health informatics because computer scientist&apos;s interest is mainly in understanding fundamental properties of computation. Health informatics, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with understanding fundamental properties of medicine that allow for the intervention of computers. The health domain provides an extremely wide variety of problems that can be tackled using computational techniques, and computer scientists are attempting to make a difference in medicine by studying the underlying principles of computer science that will allow for meaningful (to medicine) algorithms and systems to be developed. Thus, computer scientists working in computational health informatics and health scientists working in medical health informatics combine to develop the next generation of healthcare technologies.
