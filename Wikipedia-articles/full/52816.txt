First released by Sierra Studios, the game was also released for the PlayStation 2. In Half-Life, players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong. Valve, set up by former Microsoft employees, had difficulty finding a publisher for the game, with many believing that it was &quot; too ambitious &quot; a project. Sierra On-Line eventually signed the game after expressing interest in making a 3D action game. The game had its first major public appearance at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Designed for Windows, the game uses a heavily modified version of the Quake engine called GoldSrc.

Half-Life has had a notable cultural impact with its community mods and sequels spawning a large fanbase and cult following. [ Gameplay ] { Apache helicopter, a group of soldiers, and a cannon emplacement. } Half-Life is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike its peers at the time, Half-Life used scripted sequences, such as a Bullsquid ramming down a door, to advance major plot points. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, on which relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines, Half-Life s story is told entirely by means of scripted sequences, keeping the player in control of the first-person viewpoint. In line with this, the game has no cut-scenes, and the player rarely loses the ability to control Gordon, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees &quot; through his eyes &quot; for the entire length of the game. Half-Life has no &quot; levels &quot;; it instead divides the game by chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game. Progress through the world is continuous, except for breaks for loading.

Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning on a steam valve to spray hot steam at their enemies. There are few &quot; bosses &quot; in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation. Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the &quot; boss &quot;. Late in the game, the player receives a &quot; long jump module &quot; for the HEV suit, which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping. The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer-style jumping puzzles in Xen toward the end of the game. For the most part the player battles through the game alone, but is occasionally assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player, the former who will fight alongside and both who can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information.

The game also features numerous conventional weapons, such as the Glock 17 pistol, Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun, MP5 submachine gun with an attached M203 grenade launcher, Colt Python.357 Magnum revolver, and rocket launcher as well as unusual weapons ranging from a crossbow to weapons from Xen and genetically engineered weapons; such as an organic homing gun and flesh-eating parasites called &quot; Snarks &quot;. Two experimental weapons, the tau cannon (nicknamed the Gauss gun) and the Gluon Gun, are built by the scientists in the facility and are acquired by the player late in the game. [ Synopsis ] [ Setting ] Most of the game is set in a remote desert area of New Mexico in the Black Mesa Research Facility, a fictional complex that bears many similarities to both the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Area 51, at some point between the years 2000 and 2009. The game&apos;s protagonist is the theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman, an MIT graduate. Freeman becomes one of the survivors of an experiment at Black Mesa that goes horribly wrong, when an unexpected &quot; resonance cascade &quot; —a fictitious phenomenon —rips dimension al seams, devastating the facility. Aliens from another dimension known as Xen subsequently enter the facility through these dimensional seams (an event known as the &quot; Black Mesa incident &quot; ). As Freeman tries to make his way out of the ruined facility, he soon discovers that he is caught between two sides: the hostile aliens and the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, a United States Marine Corps Special Operations division dispatched to cover up the incident by eliminating the organisms, as well as Dr. Freeman and the other surviving Black Mesa personnel. Throughout the game, a mysterious figure known (but not actually referred to in-game) as the &quot; G-Man &quot; regularly appears, and seems to be monitoring Freeman&apos;s progress. Ultimately, Freeman uses the cooperation of surviving scientists and security officers to work his way towards the mysterious &quot; Lambda Complex &quot; of Black Mesa (signified with the Greek &quot; λ &quot; character), where a team of survivors teleport him to the alien world Xen to kill the Nihilanth, the semi-physical entity keeping Xen&apos;s side of the dimensional rift open. The game&apos;s plot was originally inspired by the video game s Doom, Quake (both PC games produced by id Software ), and Resident Evil (published by Capcom ), Stephen King &apos;s short story / novella The Mist, and an episode of The Outer Limits called &quot; The Borderland &quot;.

Finding survivors, Freeman learns that communication lines to the outside world are completely cut and is encouraged to head to the surface for help because of his suit. His journey consists of sidestepping Black Mesa&apos;s structural damage and defending himself against hostile Xen creatures suddenly teleporting into the area.

Valve initially struggled to find a publisher, many believing their project too ambitious for a studio headed by newcomers to the video game industry; however, Sierra On-Line had been very interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on the Quake engine, and signed Valve for a one-game deal. [ http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part24.html The Final Hours of Half-Life: The Right E-mail, the Right Time GameSpot 2006-09-14 ] The original code name for Half-Life was Quiver, after the Arrowhead military base from Stephen King &apos;s novella The Mist, an early inspiration for the game. [ http://uk.gamespot.com/features/halflife_final/part3.html The Final Hours of Half-Life: The Valve Difference GameSpot 2006-09-14 ] Gabe Newell explained that the name Half-Life was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the Greek letter λ (lower-case lambda ), which represents the decay constant in the half-life equation. According to one of the game&apos;s designers, Harry Teasley, Doom was a huge influence on most of the team working on Half-Life.

[ http://5years.doomworld.com/interviews/harryteasley/page3.shtml Five Years of Doom at Doomworld Doomworld 2008-02-11 ] Newell felt that &quot; Half-Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization of the experience of the first person genre. Many of us had fallen in love with videogames because of the phenomenological possibilities of the field, and felt like the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities.

This single level inspired the studio to press on with the game. As a result, the studio completely reworked the game&apos;s artificial intelligence and levels in the year leading up to its release. At E3 1998 it was given Game Critics Awards for &quot; Best PC Game &quot; and &quot; Best Action Game &quot;. The release date was delayed several times in 1998 before the game was finally released in November of that year.

The first demo, Half-Life: Day One, contained the first one-fifth of the full game, and was meant only for distribution with certain graphic cards. { Download Half-Life: Day One Demo } The second demo was released on February 12, 1999. Entitled Half-Life: Uplink, the demonstration featured many of the weapons and non-player characters in Half-Life. Set 48 hours into the game, Uplink &apos; s levels are heavily revised variations of levels cut during Half-Life &apos; s development phase, and are not present in the end version of the full game. [ Name ] The titles of Half-Life and its expansion packs are all named after scientific terms. Half-Life itself is a reference to the half-life of a quantity (such as a radioactive material), the amount of time required for the quantity to decay to half of its initial mass. The Greek letter lambda, which features prominently on the game&apos;s packaging and story, represents the related decay constant, as well as the Lambda Complex featured in the game. Opposing Force, while it could be named because the player assumes the role of one of the enemies in the original game, is also a reference to Newton&apos;s third law of motion, while Blue Shift refers to the blue shift ing of the frequency of radiation caused by the Doppler effect or special relativity, in a similar parallel reference to the name of the work shift your character takes (as stated in the manual included with the retail version of the game). In Half-Life: Decay, the title again references the half-life equation with the lambda symbol being the decay constant. It has also been speculated that the Lambda symbol was chosen as it somewhat resembles a very simple picture of an arm holding a crowbar, the first weapon acquired by Gordon Freeman, and a weapon for which the Half Life series is famous. [ Ports ] Half-Life was ported to the PlayStation 2 by Gearbox Software and released in 2001.

Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update the look of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.
