The film was based on the Men in Black comic book series by Lowell Cunningham, originally published by Marvel Comics. The film featured the creature effects and makeup of Rick Baker. The film was released on July  2, 1997, by Columbia Pictures and grossed $589,390,539 worldwide against a $90  million budget. An animated series based on the film, titled Men in Black: The Series, ran from 1997 to 2001. A live-action sequel, Men in Black II, was released in 2002. This was followed by Men in Black 3 in 2012. [ Plot ] In 1997, Agent K ( Tommy Lee Jones ) is a member of the Men in Black (MIB), a secret agency without ties to any government, whose goal is to maintain Earth as a &quot; neutral zone &quot; for extraterrestrial aliens, whom they disguise as humans around New York City. The agency maintains its secrecy by using a neuralyzer to wipe the memories of those that encounter either them or the aliens, and also the memories of former agents when they retire. Operating from an underground base at a Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority ventilation station, they fund themselves by obtaining patents on alien technologies released for consumer consumption. K&apos;s former partner D has just retired after an incident at a border line between the U.S and Mexico where an alien disguised as a human almost killed an INS Officer, so K is forced to find a new partner. Agent Zed ( Rip Torn ), the Agency&apos;s current leader, suggests that he should find a new recruit, someone &quot; fresh &quot;. Meanwhile, James Darrell Edwards III ( Will Smith ) is a rookie police officer who is pursuing a man through the streets of Manhattan. He is catching him with his mentor officers, but due to their weight (as he calls them &quot; donut &quot; officers), he is forced to apprehend him alone. Edwards is surprised as the man has the ability to jump and climb very high. After some chase, he manages to corner him on the roof. The man smiles at Edwards and blinks very unusually (his eyelids are placed horizontally instead of vertically), as he falls down to his death. Edwards explains to his supervisor the chase, but he is surprised by this and mocks him off. Just then, K arrives to the office and neuralyzes his superior and the two cops, and he also neuralyzes Edwards. After that, K talks to Edwards and offers him a &quot; new life &quot;, gives him the MIB address, and tells him to arrive at the address the next day. In the base, after Edwards completes several tests in unconventional ways, K offers him the chance to join the MIB. Edwards&apos; identity is erased, and he becomes Agent J, K&apos;s partner. K onboards J into the MIB but during this, they learn that numerous alien refugees are fleeing the Earth. MIB is contacted by an Arquillian fleet in Earth orbit; the fleet warns that a &quot; Bug, &quot; a member of a giant cockroach-like species that are at war with several alien races, has come to Earth searching for an object known as the Galaxy. Its infinite power could turn the tide of war in favor of the Bugs. To prevent this, they are willing to destroy the Earth unless the MIB can secure the Galaxy before their deadline, only hours away. Agent K and Agent J find the Bug is disguised using the skin of farmer Edgar ( Vincent D&apos;Onofrio ) after killing the human. It already killed two Arquillians it believed had the Galaxy. The two bodies, along with a cat that refuses to leave its owner, are taken to the city morgue. There, Dr. Laurel Weaver ( Linda Fiorentino ) discovers one of the tiny Arquillians is barely alive inside its human looking robot; struggling with English, it whispers to her that &quot; The Galaxy is on Orion&apos;s belt &quot; before it expires. K and J arrive to help remove the alien bodies and wipe Laurel&apos;s mind, but not before learning about this message, and Laurel suffers a déjà vu when she spots J (while J was working as an officer, she was examinating the body of a man J was chasing and she arrived at the station and questioned J but K erased her memory). They return back to the base, where Zed explains that there are no galaxies on Orion&apos;s belt. Agent K, still suspicious about J&apos;s words, goes to Frank the Pug ( Tim Blaney ), an Remoonian talking dog, who explains to K that the galaxy doesn&apos;t have to be in space and enormous to actually be a galaxy. Suspicious about this, J and K head to the jewelry store Rosenberg owned. They find the store broken in, but it&apos;s empty. Noticing the Bug, they proceed to chase and lose it. They then look at the picture of Rosenberg and his cat and realize that Orion refers to Rosenberg&apos;s pet and that the belt would mean the cat&apos;s collar. Racing back to the morgue, they encounter the Bug who has figured out the same thing. It steals the Galaxy, which hangs in a small charm, and kidnaps Laurel - escaping while the MIB secure its spacecraft to prevent it from leaving the planet. As the Arquillian deadline looms, the MIB tries to figure out how Edgar will leave. J then recalls from his initial briefing that the observation towers of the New York State Pavilion at Flushing Meadows are disguised spacecraft. Agents K and J race there, finding Edgar climbing one of the structures. Their arrival distracts the Bug but it enters the craft and starts the engines. The agents fire on the ship, forcing it to crash. As the two face off against Edgar, it rips through its disguise, swallows their guns and knocks them across the field. K tells J to keep the Bug from getting to the second ship by creating a distraction. K goads the Bug to eat him, which it does by swallowing him whole. J keeps the Bug distracted by stepping on cockroaches around a nearby dumpster. Before J can be eaten by the enraged Bug he tells the Bug to get out of his face before something bad happens. K having found his gun in the Bug&apos;s stomach, then blasts his way out, ripping the alien in half. K is slime covered but safe and J picks up the Galaxy from among the contents of the Bug&apos;s stomach. The news is then relayed to the Arquillian fleet, saving the Earth. While J and K are recovering from their battle, the top-half of the Bug suddenly rears up behind them, but Laurel shoots the Bug with J&apos;s gun which was ejected from the Bug&apos;s stomach. As MIB cleans up the situation, and K apparently prepares to neuralyze Laurel, he admits that he was not training J as a partner but as his replacement, as he is ready to retire from the agency, thinking about the words D said to him. K gives him the neuralzer and explains the device, showing the 4 buttons, with one as the activator, the three others being &quot; Days, Months, Years &quot;. He also tells J &quot; I&apos;ll see you around &quot;, to which J responds; &quot; No you won&apos;t. &quot;, and neuralyzes him. In the epilogue, Laurel is Agent J&apos;s new partner Agent L, while K (now Kevin Brown) has returned to civilian life and the girl he left behind (after apparently 35 years spent in a coma after an accident), and J and L began to investigate more aliens disguised as humans as they drive away to the headquarters. As the camera pans out, showing the Earth, solar system and eventually the galaxy, it is revealed that the galaxy is itself in a marble. A pair of alien hands finish playing with it and place it inside a sack with other such galaxies (verifying Frank&apos;s earlier statement). [ Cast ] [ Summer Movie Preview Entertainment Weekly 1997-05-16 http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C287928%2C00.html 2007-09-17 ] Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K/Kevin Brown : J&apos;s grizzled and humorless mentor. Clint Eastwood turned down the part, while Jones only accepted the role after Steven Spielberg promised the script would improve, based on his respect for Spielberg&apos;s track record. He had been disappointed with the first draft, which he reportedly said &quot; stank &quot;; he felt it did not capture the tone of the comic. Will Smith as James Darrell Edwards III/Agent J : A former NYPD member, newly recruited to the MIB. Smith was cast because Barry Sonnenfeld &apos;s wife was a fan of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Sonnenfeld also liked his performance in Six Degrees of Separation. Chris O&apos;Donnell turned down the role because he found the role of a new recruit too similar to Dick Grayson, whom he played in Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin. David Schwimmer also turned down the part. Like Jones, Smith said he accepted the role after meeting with Spielberg and cited his success as a producer. Vincent D&apos;Onofrio as Edgar the Bug: A giant alien insect who eats a farmer and uses his skin as a disguise. He comes to earth to kidnap the galaxy and use it to destroy the Arquillians. He is the main antagonist of the film. John Turturro and Bruce Campbell were both offered the role. Linda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel Weaver/Agent L: A deputy medical examiner who has had a few run-ins with the MIB in the past. Rip Torn as Chief Z (Zed): The head of the MIB. Tony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs: An alien, posing as a pawn shop owner, who deals in illegal weapons. Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Beatrice: Edgar&apos;s wife. Mike Nussbaum as Gentle Rosenberg, Arquillian Jeweler: Guardian of the galaxy, which he has attached to his pet cat&apos;s collar. Jon Gries as Van Driver Sergio Calderón as Jose Carel Struycken as Arquillian Fredric Lehne as INS Agent Janus Kent Faulcon as 2nd Lt. Jake Jensen Richard Hamilton as Agent D: K&apos;s partner at the start of the film, he decides he is too old for the job and has K erase his memory so he can retire. David Cross as Newton the Morgue Attendant Tim Blaney as Frank the Pug (voice): A smart-talking pug -like alien. [ Production ] [ December 2011 ] The film is based upon the comic book The Men in Black by Lowell Cunningham. Producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald optioned the rights to The Men in Black in 1992, and hired Ed Solomon to write a very faithful script. Parkes and MacDonald wanted Barry Sonnenfeld as director because he had helmed the darkly humorous The Addams Family and its sequel Addams Family Values. Sonnenfeld was attached to Get Shorty (1995), so they approached Les Mayfield to direct, as they had heard about the positive reception to his remake of Miracle on 34th Street. They actually saw the film later and decided he was inappropriate. [ December 2011 ] Men in Black was delayed so as to allow Sonnenfeld to make it his next project after Get Shorty. [ David Hughes Comic Book Movies Virgin Books 2003 London 123–129 0-7535-0767-6 ] Much of the initial script drafts were set underground, with locations ranging from Kansas to Washington DC and Nevada. Sonnenfeld decided to change the location to New York City, because the director felt New Yorkers would be tolerant of aliens who behaved oddly while disguised. He also felt much of the city&apos;s structures resembled flying saucers and rocket ships. Production designer Bo Welch designed the MIB headquarters with a 1960s tone in mind, because that was when their organization is formed. He cited influences from Finnish architect Eero Saarinen, who designed a terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Being the arrival point of aliens on Earth, Welch felt MIB HQ had to resemble an airport. ILM provided most of the special effects. Rick Baker led the special effects of the film, which was the most complex in his career to date. He had to have approval from both director Barry Sonnenfeld and executive producer Steven Spielberg: &quot; It was like, &apos;Steven likes the head on this one and Barry really likes the body on this one, so why don&apos;t you do a mix and match?&apos; And I&apos;d say, because it wouldn&apos;t make any sense. &quot; Sonnenfeld also changed a lot of the film&apos;s aesthetic during pre-production: &quot; I started out saying aliens shouldn&apos;t be what humans perceive them to be. Why do they need eyes? So Rick did these great designs, and I&apos;d say, &apos;That&apos;s great — but how do we know where he&apos;s looking?&apos; I ended up where everyone else did, only I took three months. &quot; [ Steve Daly Men in Black: How&apos;d they do that? Entertainment Weekly 1997-07-18 http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C288677%2C00.html 2007-09-17 ] Filming began in March 1996. Five months into the shoot, the crew realized their ending was unexciting. It was originally meant to be a humorous existential debate between Agent J and the Bug, and five potential replacements were discussed. One of these had Laurel Weaver being neuralyzed and K remaining an agent. The change to a fight sequence annoyed Rick Baker, as their animatronic Bug had to be replaced with computer-generated imagery. Further changes were made during post-production to simplify the plotline involving the possession of the tiny galaxy. The Arquillians would hand over the galaxy to the Baltians, ending a long war. The Bugs need to feed on the casualties and steal the galaxy in order to continue the war. Through changing of subtitles, the images on MIB&apos;s main computer and Frank the Pug&apos;s dialogue, the Baltians were eliminated from the plot. Earth goes from being potentially destroyed in the crossfire between the two races into being possibly destroyed by the Arquillians themselves to prevent the Bugs from getting the galaxy. These changes to the plot were carried out when only two weeks remained in the film&apos;s post-production.

In the UK only the album was released. Danny Elfman composed the score for the film, making use of his usual combination of orchestra and electronics. The score also makes prominent use of jazz for the M.I.B. theme, which consists of an ostinato, usually played on lower instruments. In the trailer, it played Confronting The Chief by Elliot Goldenthal from the film Demolition Man. [ Promotion ] [ December 2011 ] Galoob released various action figures of characters and aliens in the film. An official comic adaptation was released by Marvel Comics. The official Men in Black game is a third-person shooter developed by Gremlin Interactive and released to lackluster reviews in October &apos;97 for the PC and the following year for the PlayStation. Also a very rare promotional PlayStation video game system was released in 1997 with the Men in Black logo on the CD lid. Men in Black: The Animated Series was created by Sony Pictures Television, and also inspired several games. Men in Black was the inspiration behind the Men in Black: Alien Attack ride at Universal Studios Orlando, in which Will Smith and Rip Torn reprised their roles. A Men in Black role-playing game was also released in 1997 by West End Games. Will Smith released a single concurrent with the film, also called &quot; Men in Black &quot;. [ Reception ] Men in Black won the Academy Award for Best Makeup, and was also nominated for Best Original Score and Best Art Direction. It was also nominated for the Golden Globe of Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. [ Men in Black (1997) — Awards and Nominations Yahoo! http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800023362/awards 2007-09-17 ] The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, having a 91% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes film critic website.
