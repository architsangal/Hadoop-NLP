He is the host of comedy chat programme The Graham Norton Show on BBC One in the UK and BBC America in the US. Hot Press has described him as &quot; the 21st century&apos;s answer to Terry Wogan &quot;, with both men sharing an Irish background and the common link of being a BBC Radio 2 presenter and the BBC television commentator of the Eurovision Song Contest. [ http://hotpress.com/archive/2931306.html Reasons to be cheerful 20 June 2007 20 June 2007 Bootboy Hot Press ] Norton has won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Entertainment Performance on five occassions. [ Early life and career ] Norton was born in Clondalkin, a suburb of Dublin, but grew up in Bandon, County Cork, Ireland to a Protestant family. He was educated at Bandon Grammar School, in County Cork and then University College Cork but did not complete his studies. In 1992 his stand-up comedy drag act in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe as a tea-towel clad Mother Teresa of Calcutta made the press when Scottish Television &apos;s religious affairs department mistakenly thought he represented the real Mother Teresa. [ Festival Eye Adrian Turpin 20 August 1992 The Independent 24 ] His first appearances in broadcasting were in his spot as a regular comedian and panellist on the BBC Radio 4 show Loose Ends, when the show ran on Saturday mornings, in the early 1990s. His rise to fame began as one of the early successes of Channel 5, when he won an award for his performance as the stand-in host of a late-night TV talk show usually presented by Jack Docherty.

In 1996, Norton co-hosted the late-night quiz show Carnal Knowledge on ITV with Maria McErlane. In 1996, Norton played the part of Father Noel Furlong in three episodes ( &quot; Hell &quot;, &quot; Flight Into Terror &quot;, &quot; The Mainland &quot; ) of the Channel 4 series Father Ted. Father Noel Furlong was often seen taking charge of a small youth folk-group. [ Channel 4 ] After this early success, Norton moved to Channel 4 to host his own chat shows including So Graham Norton and V Graham Norton. As a performer who is not only openly gay, { Cohen, Benjamin (27 April 2006). &quot; Graham Norton: “I’m too old to be attractive to gay men”. Pink News. Retrieved 14 June 2011. } but also camp and flamboyant, it was here that Norton&apos;s act was fully honed as a cheeky, innuendo -laden joker. In 2003, he was the subject of controversy when, on his show on Channel 4, he made a comedic reference to the recent death of Bee Gees singer Maurice Gibb. The Independent Television Commission investigated after complaints about this insensitivity were forwarded to it and eventually Channel 4 had to make two apologies: one in the form of a caption slide before the show, another from Norton in person. Also in 2003, he was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. (Though Norton is Irish, the bulk of his television career has been in the UK.) In the summer of 2004, Norton moved across the Atlantic to start a new venture in American television. The Graham Norton Effect debuted on 24 June 2004 on Comedy Central, and was also broadcast in the UK on BBC Three. In the midst of controversy surrounding Janet Jackson&apos;s Super Bowl performance, Norton was wary of moving into the market.

Norton&apos;s jokes during his debut received some positive reviews from the British media. The Guardian noted his comments on Iceland &apos;s entry, which finished in second place, had &quot; rooted around in a cupboard and found an old bridesmaid dress from 1987 &quot; and the Armenian singers, who finished in tenth place, were sporting traditional dress, &quot; which would be true if you come from the village where Liberace is the mayor. &quot; The Times noted his highlighting of the arrest of thirty gay rights protesters in Moscow – &quot; heavy-handed policing has really marred what has been a fantastic Eurovision. &quot; { &quot; Norton&apos;s Eurovision debut reviewed &quot;.

Why didn’t she step in and say no?” which was made just before Albanian singer Kejsi Tola was set to take the stage dubbed an insult by many, sent ripples of outrage through not only Albania, but also the Albanian population in Britain. He then announced that Albania should get no points and that he didn&apos;t care what anybody else thought. There was a petition circling the net calling for a formal apology from Norton. The petition, which called his comment “very rude and insulting,” had drawn over 1,000 signatures. He never responded. { &quot; Graham Norton Albanian Eurovision Insult &quot;. } In 2011, he snarked that if Jedward &apos;s entry into the competition that year won, the twins would never sleep again.

Norton took part in the TV programme, &apos;&apos;Who Do You Think You Are?&apos;&apos;, to trace his ancestry. It was discovered that his family were originally planters sent over from England to take over Irish land. Some members of his family had fought for the British Monarchy during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and taken part in a massacre of Catholics in Carnew Castle. Another member of his family was later killed in battle by the United Irishmen.
