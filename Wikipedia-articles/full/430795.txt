He is best known for his life-size bronze statues, which actually are casting s of living people of all ages depicting them engaged in day-to-day activities. A large staff of technicians perform the fabrication. { Sydney, } { Australia } [ Early life ] Johnson was born in New Jersey. His father was John Seward Johnson I, and his mother was Ruth Dill, the sister of actress Diana Dill, therefore making him a first cousin of actor Michael Douglas. Johnson grew up with five siblings: Mary Lea Johnson Richards, Elaine Johnson, Diana Melville Johnson, Jennifer Underwood Johnson, and James Loring &quot; Jimmy &quot; Johnson. His parents divorced around 1937, and his father remarried two years later, producing his only brother Jimmy Johnson, making him an uncle to film director Jamie Johnson. { http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093724,00.html } Johnson attended Forman School for dyslexics [ http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/30/nyregion/seward-s-follies.html?pagewanted%3D2 The New York Times Seward&apos;s Follies J.

Examples of his statues include: [ 70 ft m on ] The Awakening (1980), his largest and most dramatic work, a five-part statue that depicts a giant trying to free himself from underground. The sculpture was located at Hains Point in Washington, D.C. for nearly twenty-eight years while still owned by Johnson. It was moved to Prince George&apos;s County, Maryland in February 2008, and an attempt was made by the new curator to correct some of the scale distortions of the original installation by altering some implied underground connections and placing the parts in different relationships to each other. [ November 2011 ] Double Check (1982), a statue of a man checking his briefcase, formerly located in Liberty Plaza Park across from the World Trade Center. Photographs of the damaged and dust-covered statue, part of a building developer&apos;s required display, were among the photographs taken following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. A restored statue has been returned to the now-renamed Zuccotti Park and the area has been opened to the public. The statue has been decorated by Occupy Wall Street protesters. Hitchhiker (1983), a statue along the side of a road leading away from the campus of Hofstra University. Allow Me (1984), a statue of man holding an umbrella, in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon. Competition (1984), A sculpture of Julie Wier, Fairview Heights, Illinois. Chosen to represent the spirit of the people of St. Louis as winner of the picture yourself as a work of art contest. Dedicated on June 16, 1984 unsigned St. Louis County Library in St. Louis, MO. Déjeuner Déjà Vu (1994), at Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, a facility founded by Johnson, is a three-dimensional imitation of Edouard Manet &apos;s painting, Le déjeuner sur l&apos;herbe. Page on Johnson&apos;s site Copyright Infringement (1994), at Grounds for Sculpture, a facility founded by Johnson, is a sculpture named to flaunt his disdain for criticism of his copies of the iconic works of fine art artists with international recognition, representing the fine artist, Manet, whose work he has copied. Unconditional Surrender (a series with several versions begun in 2005), a spokesperson for Johnson has stated that this series is based on a photograph that is in the public-domain, Kissing the War Goodbye, by Victor Jorgensen, Robert L. Pincus, &quot; Port surrenders in the battle against kitsch &quot;, San Diego Union-Tribune, March 11, 2007. however, the Jorgensen photographic image does not extend low enough to include the lower legs and shoes of the subjects, revealed in Alfred Eisenstaedt &apos;s famous photograph, V–J day in Times Square, that are represented identically in the statue. A spokesperson for Life has called it a copyright infringement of the latter image. Nonetheless, the first version, a bronze statue of life-size, was placed on temporary exhibition during the 2005 anniversary of V-J Day at the Times Square Information Center near where the original photographs were taken in Manhattan. &quot; V-J Day Is Replayed, but the Lip-Lock&apos;s Tamer This Time &quot;, New York Times, August 15, 2005. Several slightly differing twenty-five-foot-versions have been constructed in styrofoam and aluminum with little detail, painted, and put on display by Johnson in San Diego, California, comparison with other statues placed at San Diego Key West, Florida, Snug Harbor in New York, and Sarasota, Florida. Their immensity has drawn crowds of viewers at each site although the view of them from nearby is severely limited, essentially allowing a vista of the legs and up the skirt. The statues are described as kitsch by an art critic. A proposal to establish a permanent location for a copy on the Sarasota bay front has generated a heated controversy about the suitability of the statue to the location, suitability as a military service memorial, http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090822/LETTERS/908219932/2163/OPINION?Title=Reject-copycat-sailor-statue criticism by veteran and former Life magazine editor, Sarasota Herald Tribune, August 22, 2009 the permanent placement of any statue on that public property, as well as the particular issues of unoriginality, mechanical construction, and alleged kitsch iness of the statue. http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090713/VIDEO/907132002 &amp; template=video Unconditional Surrender Statue In final agreement documents, Johnson committed the purchase price to cover copyright liability damages in order to have the statue placed. The city was wary of accepting a gift that might result in a financial loss from a possible legal battle that evidenced merit, according to the city attorney. http://www.srqmagazine.com/JMailer/showMassMail.cfm?masID=1967 Ogles, Jacob, Unconditional Surrender Deal to Be Finalized Today, SRQ Daily, June 11, 2010 { Unconditional Surrender &apos;&apos;, which is cited as an unauthorized derivative of the photograph &quot; } { V–J day in Times Square &quot; by Alfred Eisenstaedt by its copyright holder } First Ride (2006), a statue of a father helping his young daughter learn to ride a bike, in Carmel, Indiana.

Until 2012, the sculpture was located at Pioneer Plaza in Chicago, where it has attracted many visitors and some degree of controversy. Marilyn Monroe Statue Protects Chicagoans in the Rain It was moved to downtown Palm Springs, California in 2012. For statues made recently in a series named, Iconic, by Johnson, { http://www.sewardjohnson.com/site/index.html biographical information on web site of the subject } many of which are very large, a computer program is employed that translates two-dimensional images into statues that are constructed by a machine driven by the program. Often, these subjects are images that already are well known as the works of others, generating heated ethical controversies regarding copyright infringement and derivative works due to substantial similarity issues. Johnson&apos;s works were selected by the United States Information Agency to represent the freedoms of the United States in a public and private partnership enterprise representation sponsored by General Motors and many other U.S. corporations at the World EXPO celebration in Seville, Spain during 1992. [ Criticism ] As early as 1984 Johnson&apos;s work was labeled as &quot; kitsch &quot; by an art professor and critic at Princeton University, who explained its rejection as he was commenting on a controversy raging about the work in New Haven, Connecticut, [ Neuhaus Cable http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0%2C%2C20087432%2C00.html Cast in Bronze and Controversy, Sculptor J. Seward Johnson&apos;s Works Find No Haven in New Haven People.com 1984-03-26 2010-06-08 ] and the label has dogged him throughout his career. His cast statues and imitations of famous creations by others have not been well received in professional art circles. [ August 2010 ] Some of them include the use of computer-driven designs from images of original artworks by others that are being presented as Johnson&apos;s original artwork. Software such as Maya is capable of producing such designs and greatly enlarging them mechanically, without artistic modeling. They can be cut into styrofoam, plastic, and other materials. Inexpensive metals such as aluminum now are being used in Asia for second-generation copies of works he first had executed in bronze from casts of living people and later statues that are computer generated. [ August 2009 ] Robert Hughes, the art critic of the New York Times, and numerous other art critics [ August 2010 ] claim that his work is not art. [ August 2010 ] His 2003 show at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, &quot; Beyond the Frame: Impressionism Revisited, &quot; which presented his statues imitating famous Impressionist paintings, was a success with audiences, but was panned by professional art critics of national stature and drew strong criticism from curators at other museums about a prominent museum of fine art presenting an exhibit of his kitschy work. { Blake Gopnik, Washington Post. &quot; A Bad Impression. At the Corcoran Gallery, Seward Johnson&apos;s Travesty in Three Dimensions &quot; } { Lynette Clemonson, &quot; Corcoran, After Dispute, Casts About for New Path &quot; } [ Philanthropy ] Johnson is a very wealthy man who has made contributions to the appreciation of art by way of providing venues for art { http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-21840.html } and supporting technical facilities that could help other artists learn techniques he applied to build some of his own statues. The foundry he established provides professional service to others as well as for his own works. Although they are pointedly self-serving, most have become identified as nonprofit facilities, organizations, and foundations. Frequently he funds completely the exhibits of his work. He often donates his statues to contribute to fund raising efforts by worthy charities. Johnson created the Johnson Atelier Technical Institute of Sculpture, an educational, nonprofit casting and fabrication facility in 1974 as a means of fostering young sculptors&apos; talents, while creating a foundry designed to construct his statues that is so well-equipped and staffed that it is chosen by many renowned sculptors. Johnson has stopped using it, however, having his own large statues made in China. He also founded an organization called The Sculpture Foundation, to promote his works. In 1987, he published Celebrating the Familiar: The Sculpture of J. Seward Johnson, Jr. (ISBN 0-912383-57-7) Johnson purchased the old New Jersey Fairgrounds in Hamilton, New Jersey and in 1992 founded the Grounds for Sculpture to display his works and to provide a venue for outdoor displays. In 2000 it was converted to a nonprofit organization with the same intent. He is former president of the International Sculpture Center of Hamilton, New Jersey, which publishes a magazine out of offices in Washington, D.C. Johnson also is the former president of a large oceanographic research institution in Florida founded by his father, the publisher of a science magazine, and the founder of an off-Broadway theater in New York. [ Personal life ] Johnson was excluded from his father&apos;s will, which left the bulk of his fortune to Barbara Piasecka Johnson, his father&apos;s wife and former chambermaid. He and his siblings sued on grounds that their father wasn&apos;t mentally competent at the time he signed the will. It was settled out of court, and the children were granted about 12% of the fortune.
