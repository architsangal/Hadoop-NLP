The Boxster is Porsche&apos;s first road vehicle to be originally designed as a roadster since the 550 Spyder. The first-generation Boxster (the 986) was introduced in late 1996; it was powered by a 2.5 litre flat six-cylinder engine. In 2000, the new Boxster S variant was introduced with a larger 3.2 litre motor, and the base model received a more powerful 2.7 litre engine. In 2003, styling and engine output was upgraded on both variants. In 2005, Porsche unveiled the second generation of Boxster: the type 987. The 987 is more powerful than its predecessor and featured styling inspired by the Carrera GT. Engine output increased in 2007, when both Boxster models received the engines from their corresponding Porsche Cayman variants. In 2009, the Boxster models received several new cosmetic and mechanical upgrades, further increasing engine output and performance. The third generation Boxster (type 981) was launched at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. Production of the 986 began at the former Porsche 928 facility in Stuttgart, Germany in 1996. Valmet Automotive also manufactured Boxsters under contract to Porsche at a facility in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The Boxster was Porsche&apos;s biggest volume seller from its introduction in 1996 until the company introduced the Cayenne sport utility vehicle in 2003. The Boxster&apos;s name is a portmanteau of the word &quot; boxer &quot;, referring to the vehicle&apos;s horizontally opposed or &quot; boxer &quot; engine, and the word &quot; roadster &quot;, referring to the vehicle&apos;s two-seat capacity and convertible top.

Harm Lagaay &apos;s design, inspired by the 356 Cabriolet, Speedster, and 550 Spyder, stimulated a commercial turnaround for Porsche. Through consultation with Toyota, Porsche began widely sharing parts among models and slashed costs. The 986 Boxster had the same bonnet, front wings, headlights, and engine architecture as the 996. Many believe the introduction of the Boxster helped save Porsche from acquisition. All 986 and 987 Boxsters use the M96, a water-cooled, horizontally opposed ( &quot; flat &quot; ), six-cylinder engine. It was Porsche&apos;s first water-cooled non-front engine. In the Boxster, it is placed mid-engine, while in the 911, rear-engine. The mid-engine layout provides smoothness throughout the rev range, a low center of gravity, near-perfect weight distribution, and neutral handling. Early engines had a small number of failures, due to cracked or slipped cylinder liners, which were resolved by a minor redesign in 2000. Other failures have been reported, most notably involving the intermediate shaft (IMS) bearing, but affecting less than 5% of all cars.

The plastic rear window was replaced by a smaller glass window. The interior received a glove compartment, new electro-mechanical hood and trunk release mechanism (with an electronic emergency release in the fuse box panel) and an updated steering wheel. Porsche installed a reworked exhaust pipe and air intake. In addition, the often disliked amber &quot; fried egg &quot; front indicators were replaced with clear indicators. The rear light cluster was also changed with translucent grey turn signals replacing the amber ones. The side marker lights on the front wings were changed as well from amber to clear, except on American market cars where they remained amber. The bumpers were also changed slightly for a more defined, chiselled appearance, and new wheel designs were made available. [ Limited Editions ] [ 550 Spyder 50th Anniversary Edition ] In 2004 the 550 Spyder 50th Anniversary Edition was released, with a production run of just 1953 cars. These were all painted GT Silver Metallic, the same color as the car-show version of the Carrera GT supercar, and had unique cocoa-brown full-leather interior as standard with grey natural leather as a no-cost option. Each car also had special interior paintwork, a high-end BOSE sound system, two-tone grey and silver 18 &quot; Carrera wheels (unpainted as another zero-cost option), [ 5 mm in 1 on ] wheel spacers, the Boxster S sport exhaust, the M030 option sports suspension, and a plate on the center console piece commonly known as the &quot; batwing &quot; showing the production number. Only on the American market cars were the rear turn signals red rather than clear. 50th Anniversary 550 Nose 50th Anniversary 550 Front 3/4 50th Anniversary 550 Rear 3/4 50th Anniversary 550 Cocoa Interior [ 987 ] [ 95.1 in mm 0 on ] [ http://www.roadandtrack.com/assets/download/0503_best_sports_car_data_panel.pdf Best All-Around Sports Car 2008-03-18 2005 March PDF Road &amp; Track Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc. ] { 2005–08: } [ 171.6 in mm 0 on ] { 2009– : } [ 172.0 in mm 0 on ] { 2005–08: } [ 70.9 in mm 0 on ] { 2009– : } [ 71.5 in mm 0 on ] [ 51.0 in mm 0 on ] [ 3130 lb kg 0 on ] [ 16.9 USgal L 1 on ] { Porsche Cayman } { 5-speed } { automatic 5-speed } { manual 6-speed manual 7-speed } { PDK } The second generation of the Boxster (internally known as the 987) made its debut at the 2004 Paris Motor Show alongside the new 911 (997). The car became available in 2005. 2005–2008 Porsche Boxster S In appearance the car remains very similar to the previous generation. The most obvious styling change is to the headlights, which now have a profile similar to those of the Carrera GT, Porsche&apos;s mid-engined supercar. The intake vents on the sides of the Boxster are now larger, with more pronounced horizontal slats and are coloured metallic silver, irrespective of the paint colour on the rest of the car. The wheel arches have been enlarged to allow wheels up to 19  inches in diameter, a first for the Boxster series. The most significant updates from the 986 series are in the interior, with a more prominent circular theme evident in the instrument cluster and cooling vents. Porsche claims that the 987 Boxster shares only 20% of its components with its predecessor, despite their being almost identical from the outside. The base engine is a 2.7  L 176  kW (240  hp) flat-6, with the Boxster S getting a 3.2  L 206  kW (280  hp) engine. The Cayman series is derived from the 987. For 2007 the base Boxster received a revised engine featuring VarioCam Plus to provide a [ 5 hp kW on ] boost ( [ 245 hp kW on ] the same as the Cayman). The Boxster S engine was upgraded from 3.2L to 3.4L, resulting in the production of [ 15 hp kW on ] more ( [ 295 hp kW on ] the same as the Cayman S). These upgrades made the Boxster series and the Cayman series equivalent in terms of power.

Both models feature greater power due to an increase in engine displacement for the Boxster and the incorporation of Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) for the Boxster S. Both models are now available with Porsche&apos;s new 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) dual clutch gearbox but come standard with a new 6-speed manual gearbox. Displacement in the standard Boxster&apos;s flat-six engine increased from 2.7 to 2.9 liters, increasing power from [ 245 hp kW on ] to [ 255 hp kW on ]. Use of DFI in the Boxster S raised the output of the 3.4 liter engine from [ 295 hp kW on ] to [ 310 hp kW on ]. Cosmetic changes to the 2009 Boxster and Boxster S include new head and tail lights, larger front air intakes with incorporated day time running lights, and an altered lower rear end flanked by twin diffusers. The interior includes the redesigned Porsche Communication Management System as an option with a touchscreen interface to reduce button clutter.

The base price for the PDE2 Boxster was US$66,900. [ Boxster Spyder ] Boxster Spyder On November 5, 2009, Porsche officially announced the creation of a new production Boxster which was officially unveiled at the 2009 Los Angeles Motor Show. To be positioned above the Boxster S, the Boxster Spyder will be the lightest Porsche on the market, weighing [ 2811 lbs ], a full [ 176 lbs ] lighter than a Boxster S. This has been achieved through the elimination of the conventional soft top&apos;s operating mechanism, the radio/PCM unit, air conditioning, storage compartments, handles, cupholders and large LED light modules on the front fascia, although some of these can be re-added to the car in the form of options. The vehicle will ride on a firmer suspension than the other Boxster models, and will also be almost one inch lower in order to have firmer handling. A manually operated canvas top, sports bucket seats and two signature humps running along the back of the vehicle provide characteristic design elements. It will offer a six-cylinder boxer engine with [ 320 hp kW PS 0 ] and [ 273 lbft Nm on ] of torque (a [ 10 hp kW on ] increase over the engine in the Boxster S and the same engine used in the related Cayman S), with manual transmission as standard and Porsche&apos;s PDK dual-clutch gearbox as an option. The vehicle was released worldwide in February 2010 as a 2011 model with a base price of US$61,200.
