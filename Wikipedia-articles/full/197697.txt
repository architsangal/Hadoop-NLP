Photo by writer } { Mario Biondi, July 7, 2006&apos;&apos; } The Gelug or Gelug-pa (or dGe Lugs Pa, dge-lugs-pa, or Dgelugspa), also known as the Yellow Hat sect, is a school of Buddhism founded by Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), a philosopher and Tibet an religious leader. The first monastery he established was at Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. Allying themselves with the Mongols as a powerful patron, the Gelug emerged as the pre-eminent Buddhist school in Tibet since the end of the 16th century. [ Origins and development ] [ Tsongkhapa ] The Gelu-school was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419). A great admirer of the Kadampa (Bka&apos;-gdams-pa) teachings, Tsongkhapa was a promoter of the Kadam School&apos;s emphasis on the mahāyāna principle of universal compassion as the fundamental spiritual orientation. He combined this with a strong emphasis on the cultivation of in-depth insight into the doctrine of emptiness as propounded by the Indian Madhyamaka masters Nāgārjuna (2nd century) and Candrakīrti (7th century). Tsongkhapa said that these two aspects of the spiritual path, compassion and insight into wisdom, must be rooted in a wholehearted wish for liberation impelled by a genuine sense of renunciation. He called these the &quot; Three Principal Aspects of the Path &quot;, and asserted that it is on the basis of these three that one must embark on the profound path of vajrayāna Buddhism. [ Establishment of the Dalai Lamas ] In 1577 Sonam Gyatso, who was considered to be the third incarnation of Gyalwa Gendün Drup, [ McKay 2003 18 ] formed an alliance with the then most powerful Mongol leader, Altan Khan. [ McKay 2003 18 ] As a result, Sonam Gyatso was designated as &quot; Dalai &quot; (a translation into Mongolian of the name Gyatso, meaning ocean), [ McKay 2003 18 ] and Gyalwa Gendün Drup and Gendun Gyatso were posthumously recognized as the 1st and 2nd Dalai Lamas. [ McKay 2003 19 ] Sonam Gyatso was very active in proselytizing among the Mongols, [ McKay 2003 19 ] and the Gelug tradition was to become the main spiritual orientations of the Mongols in the ensuing centuries. [ McKay 2003 19 ] This brought the Gelugpas powerful patrons who were to propel them to pre-eminence in Tibet. [ McKay 2003 19 ] The Gelug-Mongol alliance was further strengthened as after Sonam Gyatso&apos;s death, his incarnation was found to be Altan Khan&apos;s great-grandson. [ McKay 2003 19 ] [ Emergence as dominant school ] By the end of the 16th century, following violent strife among the sects of Tibetan Buddhism, the Gelug school emerged as the dominant one. According to Tibetan historian Samten Karmay, Sonam Chophel { also Sonam Choephel or Sonam Rabten } (1595-1657), treasurer of the Ganden Palace, was the prime architect of the Gelug&apos;s rise to political power. Later he received the title Desi [Wylie: sde-sris], meaning &quot; Regent &quot;, which he would earn through his efforts to establish Gelugpa power. { Samten G. Karmay, &apos;&apos;The Great Fifth &apos;&apos; } From the period of Lozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century, the Dalai Lama s held political control over central Tibet. [ Teachings ] [ Lamrim and Sunyata ] The central teachings of the Gelug School are the Stages of the Path (lamrim), based on the teachings of the Indian master Atiśa (c. 11th century), and the systematic cultivation of the view of emptiness. [ Vajrayāna Practice ] This is combined with the yoga s of highest yoga tantra deities such as Guhyasamāja, Cakrasaṃvara, Yamāntaka and Kālacakra, where the key focus is the direct experience of the indivisible union of bliss and emptiness. Guhyasamāja is the principal one. As the Dalai Lama remarks, [ There is a saying in the Gelug, &apos;If one is on the move it is Guhyasamāja. If one is still, it is Guhyasamāja. If one is meditating, it should be upon Guhyasamāja.&apos; Therefore, whether one is engaged in study or practice, Guhyasamāja should be one&apos;s focus. &quot; Speech to the Second Gelug Conference by the Dalai Lama (06-12-2000), retrieved 03-23-2010). ] [ Vinaya ] The Gelug school focuses on ethics and monastic discipline of the vinaya as the central plank of spiritual practice. In particular, the need to pursue spiritual practice in a graded, sequential manner is emphasized. Arguably, Gelug is the only school of vajrayāna Buddhism that prescribes monastic ordination as a necessary qualification and basis in its teachers (lamas / gurus). [ March 2010 ] Lay people are usually not permitted to give initiations if there are teachers with monastic vows within close proximity. [ Texts ] Six commentaries by Tsongkhapa are the prime source for the studies of the Gelug tradition, as follows: The Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path (Lam-rim chen-mo), The Great Exposition of Tantras (sNgag-rim chenmo), The Essence of Eloquence on the Interpretive and Definitive Teachings (Drnng-nges legs-bshad snying-po), The Praise of Relativity (rTen-&apos;brel bstodpa), The Clear Exposition of the Five Stages of Guhyasamāja (gSang-&apos;dus rim-lnga gsal-sgron) and The Golden Rosary (gSer-phreng). Each Gelug monastery uses its own set of commentarial texts by different authors, known as monastic manuals (Tib. yigcha). The teachings of Tsongkhapa are seen as a protection against developing misconceptions in understanding and practice of mahāyāna and vajrayāna Buddhism. It is said that his true followers take The Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path as their heart teaching. [ Monasteries and Lineage Holders ] { Spituk Monastery during the Gustor Festival } [ Monasteries ] Tsongkhapa founded the monastery of Ganden in 1409 as his main seat. Drepung Monastery was founded by Jamyang Choje, Sera Monastery was founded by Chöje Shakya Yeshe and the Gyalwa Gendün Drup founded Tashi Lhunpo Monastery. Labrang Monastery, in Xiahe County in Gansu province (and in the traditional Tibetan province of Amdo), was founded in 1709 by the first Jamyang Zhaypa, Ngawang Tsondru. Many Gelug monasteries were built throughout Tibet as well as in China and Mongolia. [ Lineage holders ] Tsongkhapa had many students, his two main disciples being Gyaltsab Je (1364–1431) and Khedrub Je (1385–1438). Other outstanding disciples were Togden Jampal Gyatso, Jamyang Choje, Jamchenpa Sherap Senge and Gyalwa Gendün Drup, the &apos;first&apos; Dalai Lama (1391–1474). After Tsongkhapa&apos;s passing, his teachings were held and spread by Gyaltsab Je and Khedrub Je who were his successors as abbots of Ganden monastery. The lineage is still held by the Ganden Tripa s – the throne-holders of Ganden Monastery – among whom the present holder is Thubten Nyima Lungtok Tenzin Norbu, the 102nd Ganden Tripa (and not, as often misunderstood, by the Dalai Lama). Among the main lineage holders of the Gelug are: The successive incarnations of the Dalai Lama (also commonly referred to as &apos;Gyalwa Rinpoche&apos;), The succession of the Panchen Lama, the Chagkya Dorje Chang, Ngachen Könchok Gyaltsen, Kyishö Tulku Tenzin Thrinly, Jamyang Shepa, Phurchok Jampa Rinpoche, Jamyang Dewe Dorje, Takphu Rinpoche, Khachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, Successive incarnations of Kyabje Yongzin Ling Rinpoche, Successive incarnations of Kyabje Yongzin Trijang Rinpoche. [ Criticism ] [ Mekong Valley ] Scottish Botanist George Forrest, who witnessed the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion led by the Gelug Lamas, wrote that the majority of the people in the Mekong valley in Yunnan were Tibetan. According to his accounts, the Gelugpas were the dominant power in the region, with their Lamas effectively governing the area. Forrest accused them of using &quot; force and fraud &quot; to &quot; terrorise the... peasantry &quot;.
