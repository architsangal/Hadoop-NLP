Three 360° turnings of one arm of an Archimedean spiral The Archimedean spiral (also known as the arithmetic spiral) is a spiral named after the 3rd century BC Greek mathematician Archimedes. It is the locus of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant angular velocity. Equivalently, in polar coordinates (r, θ) it can be described by the equation \, r=a+b\theta with real numbers a and b. Changing the parameter a will turn the spiral, while b controls the distance between successive turnings. Archimedes described such a spiral in his book On Spirals. [ Characteristics ] The Archimedean spiral has the property that any ray from the origin intersects successive turnings of the spiral in points with a constant separation distance (equal to 2 π b if θ is measured in radian s ), hence the name &quot; arithmetic spiral &quot;. In contrast to this, in a logarithmic spiral these distances, as well as the distances of the intersection points measured from the origin, form a geometric progression. The Archimedean spiral has two arms, one for &amp; theta;   &gt;  0 and one for &amp; theta;   &lt;  0. The two arms are smoothly connected at the origin. Only one arm is shown on the accompanying graph. Taking the mirror image of this arm across the y-axis will yield the other arm. [ Separation distance between turns ] Some sources describe the Archimedean spiral as a spiral with a &quot; constant separation distance &quot; between successive turns. { &quot; successive turnings of the Archimedean spiral have a constant separation distance &quot; } [ Havil Julian Nonplussed! Mathematical Proof of Implausible Ideas Princeton Universoty Press Princeton, New Jersey 2007 109 978-0-691-12056-0 ] This is somewhat misleading. The constant distances in the Archimedean spiral are measured along rays from the origin which do not cross the curve at right angles, whereas a distance between parallel curve s is measured orthogonally to both curves. There is a curve slightly different from the Archimedean spiral, the involute of a circle, whose turns have constant separation distance in the latter sense of parallel curve s. [ General Archimedean spiral ] Sometimes the term Archimedean spiral is used for the more general group of spirals r=a+b\theta^{1\!/\!x}. The normal Archimedean spiral occurs when x  =  1. Other spirals falling into this group include the hyperbolic spiral, Fermat&apos;s spiral, and the lituus. Virtually all static spirals appearing in nature are logarithmic spiral s, not Archimedean ones. Many dynamic spirals (such as the Parker spiral of the solar wind, or the pattern made by a Catherine&apos;s wheel ) are Archimedean. [ Applications ] One method of squaring the circle, by relaxing the strict limitations on the use of straightedge and compass in ancient Greek geometric proofs, makes use of an Archimedean spiral. Mechanism of a scroll pump The Archimedean spiral has a variety of real-world applications. Scroll compressor s, made from two interleaved Archimedean spirals of the same size, are used for compressing liquids and gases.

Archimedean spirals are also used in digital light processing (DLP) projection systems to minimize the &quot; rainbow effect &quot; [ July 2011 ], making it look as if multiple colors are displayed at the same time, when in reality red, green, and blue are being cycled extremely quickly.
