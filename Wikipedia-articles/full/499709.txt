[ December 2008 ] [ 2000 2 12 ] [ 2000 11 18 ] { Power Rangers Lost Galaxy } { Power Rangers Time Force } Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue (often abbreviated as PRLR and often simply called Lightspeed Rescue) is the 2000 incarnation of the Power Rangers TV franchise, based on the Super Sentai series Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFive. It was the first incarnation of Power Rangers to have the Rangers&apos; identities to be known to the public from the outset, as opposed to previous incarnations where a Ranger&apos;s identity was to be kept secret, revealed only in extreme circumstances. The series was also the first where the Rangers&apos; powers, Zords, and weapons were manmade and had no mystical or extraterrestrial origin whatsoever. Lightspeed Rescue also had, for the first time, a Power Ranger with no Super Sentai counterpart in the Titanium Ranger, as there was no regular sixth Ranger in GoGo V. It is the last Saban Entertainment-produced Power Rangers series to feature the main villain from its Super Sentai counterpart, until the premiere of Power Rangers Samurai. The next series to feature the main villain from its Super Sentai counterpart would be the Disney-produced Power Rangers Mystic Force, which premiered six years later. [ Synopsis ] The series takes place in the fictitious city of Mariner Bay, California, which was built on an ancient demon burial ground. When the demons were accidentally released from their tomb in the desert, they threaten to destroy Mariner Bay. Therefore, a government organization called Lightspeed Rescue, headed by Captain William Mitchell, recruits four civilians and his own daughter to defend the city. Each of the four civilians chosen had a special area of expertise: Carter Grayson, the Red Lightspeed Ranger, was a fire fighter in the local fire department; Chad Lee, the Blue Lightspeed Ranger, worked as a lifeguard and marine animal trainer at a local aquarium and a marine amusement park; Joel Rawlings, the Green Lightspeed Ranger, was a stunt pilot; Kelsey Winslow, the Yellow Lightspeed Ranger, was an extreme sports athlete; and Dana Mitchell, the Captain&apos;s daughter, who agreed to become the Pink Lightspeed Ranger, was a nurse and practiced medical arts. The five Power Rangers were aided by a team of scientists and engineers led by Miss Angela Fairweather, and operated out of the Lightspeed Aquabase, an underwater military compound that also deters the hydrophobic demons from directly attacking the base. The five Rangers would be joined by Captain Mitchell&apos;s (long thought to be dead) son, Ryan Mitchell, who would become the Titanium Ranger. Together, the six Rangers would prevail against the demon forces time after time, culminating in a final showdown where, in the Power Rangers tradition, all of the Zords and much of the weapons and other equipment that was used by the Power Rangers over the series was destroyed. In addition, Lightspeed Rescue featured a reunion reappearance of characters from Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, when the villainess Trakeena comes to Earth to destroy it and the Lightspeed Rangers team up with the Galaxy Rangers. [ Characters ] [ The Lightspeed Rangers ] [ Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers ] The Lightspeed Rangers Carter Grayson The main character and the leader of the team.

He was portrayed by Michael Chaturantabut. Joel Rawlings Known as the &quot; Sky Cowboy &quot; for his acrobatic stunts in the air, he was the most reluctant to join, wanting to leave immediately after he was taken to the Lightspeed Rescue base. However, after seeing people getting hurt, he joined the team, becoming the Green Lightspeed Ranger. He also has a massive crush on Ms. Fairweather, the scientist who developed the Lightspeed weapons. He also provides most of the comic relief during the series. He was portrayed by Keith Robinson.

Diabolico came and told Captain Mitchell he&apos;d save Ryan, but wouldn&apos;t see Ryan until his 20th birthday. At first Captain Mitchell refused, but then agreed and Diabolico saved Ryan and took him away, telling Ryan that his father let him fall. Ryan makes his entrance as the Titanium Ranger, having stolen the test morpher. However, Ryan remembers the past, has a change of heart, and joins the Lightspeed team. Portrayed by Rhett Fisher.

Attempted to open gateway to the Shadow World to unleash all of its fallen monsters but ended up becoming a resident herself after Carter kicked her into the gate and fell through because of Diabolico&apos;s doing. (voiced by Diane Salinger ) Prince Olympius The son of Queen Bansheera. At the beginning of the series, he was an infant called Impus. But he gained Diabolico&apos;s star power and used it to mature into his current form. This sparked a rivalry between them after Diabolico returned. Later, in order to escape the Shadow World, was forced to absorb fallen monsters to gain another mutated form. He was reverted back to adult form when defeated by Rangers. He gained a super-powerful draconic final form near the finale and along with Diabolico, was successful in destroying nearly all of Rangers&apos; zords. He was destroyed for good by Lifeforce Megazord. (voiced by Michael Forest ) Diabolico Original antagonist of the 1st half of Lightspeed; he is a demon equipped with the Star Power. He first appeared to save Ryan from death and took him into custody. Was destroyed twice in the series, first time was when he fought the Rangers in the Lightspeed Solarzord (in episode 16), and again when facing Olympius.

(voiced by David Lodge ) Jinxer Monster-maker demon, creates monsters using magical cards and incantations. His fate was unknown as he was last seen piloting the Omega Megazord in placing the six stones for Bansheera&apos;s ceremony. The Omega Megazord was destroyed, but it is unknown if Jinxer survived or not. (voiced by Kim Strauss.) In &quot; Olympius Unbound &quot; Jinxer assumes the disguise of hypnotist Mister Mesmer and during a carnival show plants an evil suggestion in Captain Mitchell&apos;s subconscious. (Mesmer played by Benton Jennings.) Batlings Putty Patroller like henchmen of Bansheera. They had round black heads with bat wings protruding out of either side. They were also clad in black spandex and had bat wings coming out of their backs. Their weapons were swords. Ghouls: henchmen of Triskull and Trakeena, who appeared in the crossover episode Trakeena&apos;s Revenge. they were very powerful and loyal to Triskull. Nothing is heard of them after that episode. Cyborg Rangers: robotic counterparts to the rangers. They originally fought monsters in place of the rangers, but when a monster they were fighting struck them with lightning, they turned against the rangers and did battle with each of their respective counterparts. Each ranger eventually destroyed their respective cyborg counterpart. [ Zords ] [ Zords in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue ] The first Zords in Lightspeed Rescue were all based on rescue vehicles. The Rail Rescues carried these Zords out of the holding bay, and could also form their own Megazord. The Max Solarzord was a space shuttle-zord that was piloted by the Titanium Ranger. The Omegazords were space vehicles that were also created by Lightspeed Rescue. The Lifeforce Megazord was similar to the Lightspeed Solarzord, but required the energy of the Lightspeed Rangers as power. [ Video game ] [ Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue (video game) ] A video game based on Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue was also developed. It was available for Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, PlayStation, and PC. The PlayStation and N64 versions were 3D beat-em up games, the Game Boy version was a 2D side-scrolling platformer, and the PC version was actually an activity center.
