The airport is in Mangere, a suburb of Auckland 21  km south of the city centre. It is the central hub for Air New Zealand, and a New Zealand hub of Virgin Australia and Jetstar Airways. Auckland Airport is one of New Zealand’s most important infrastructure assets, providing thousands of jobs for the region, and is the country’s second largest cargo &apos;port&apos; by value, contributing around $14 billion to the economy, and catering for over four million visitors each year, resulting in a 70% share of New Zealand&apos;s international travellers. { Air passengers and flights (from Statistics New Zealand) } The airport is the fourth busiest in Australasia after Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane airports. However, internationally, the airport is the second busiest in Australasia, being a third busier than Melbourne Airport in terms of international passengers. { Prime Minister’s Statement to Parliament (from the New Zealand Parliament website. Retrieved Tuesday 2006-02-14.) } (Dead Link). The airport has been rated in the top 3 worldwide for airports handling 5–15 million passengers annually. { Auckland Airport rated in the top 3 worldwide for service quality (from the Auckland Airport website Retrieved Thursday 2008-03-27) } It was also voted the 8th best airport in the world by in 2011 at the world airport awards. { http://www.worldairportawards.com/ } It has a capacity of about 45 flight movements per hour, using a single runway which is fully Cat IIIb capable (at a reduced rate of movements). A close by taxiway was upgraded for use as a runway when the main runway requires maintenance or for use during emergencies, { Summary (from the &apos;Masterplan: 2005-2025&apos; document of Auckland Airport. Retrieved 2007-10-08.) } but it does not have sufficient separation distance to operate simultaneously with the main runway. In November 2007 work began on a new northern runway, to be built in several stages and to be used mainly by smaller airplanes, freeing up capacity on the main runway. However, the project was put on hold for at least 12 months in October 2009, and deferred for a further few years in August 2010 following consultation with airlines and a review of capacity management options. The timing of the recommencement of construction of the second runway will be demand driven relative to the capacity of the existing runway. [ History ] [ Overview ] The site of the airport was first used as an airfield by the Auckland Aero Club. In 1928, the club leased some land from a dairy farmer to accommodate the club&apos;s three De Havilland Gypsy Moth s. The club president noted at the time that the site &quot; has many advantages of vital importance for an aerodrome and training ground. It has good approaches, is well drained and is free from power lines, buildings and fogs. &quot; In 1960 work started to transform the site into Auckland&apos;s main airport, taking over from Whenuapai in the north-west of the city. Much of the runway is on land reclaimed from the Manukau Harbour. The first flight to leave was an Air New Zealand DC-8 in November 1965, bound for Sydney. The airport was officially opened the following year, with a &apos;grand air pageant&apos; on Auckland Anniversary weekend, 29 January to 31 January 1966. A new international terminal, named after Jean Batten, was built in 1977. [ http://www.auckland-airport.co.nz/~/media/21992090C8F345D1A9F50C0EDEA187D2.ashx?sc_database%3Dmaster Expanded Arrivals Processing Auckland Airport 2008-12-15 ] The most recent substantial upgrade was in 2005, separating arriving and departing passengers in response to the terrorism fears after 11 September 2001, which caused concerns that passengers arriving from &apos;unsafe&apos; airports (i.e. those considered to have insufficient screening procedures) could transfer bombs or weapons in the mixed zone, passing them to other passengers departing for, for example, the USA. [ Expansion ] { Emirates A380 at Auckland Airport. } The airport has commenced building a second main runway [ 1950 m ] north of the current runway to allow all weather simultaneous operations. Major earthworks have been completed however the project has been put on temporary hold to ensure timing of eventual delivery is not ahead of demand. The project&apos;s initial NZ$32 million stage is to provide a [ 1200 m on ] strip for use by smaller regional-connection planes. The new runway is expected to substantially increase the international-flight capacity of the airport, as smaller planes can be removed from the main runway. These require long safety distances from the air turbulence wakes of preceding jet airliners, causing associated additional delays. [ http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id%3D1%26amp%3Bobjectid%3D10467994%26amp%3Bpnum%3D0 Stage one begins for second runway The New Zealand Herald 5 October 2007 A7 Mathew Dearnaley ] Construction for Stage One started in November 2007. However, Stage Two will likely see the runway lengthened to [ 1650 m ] which will enable domestic jet flights to use it. Stage Three (final stage) will lengthen the runway to [ 2150 m ], allowing medium sized international jet flights to land there, from destinations such as the Pacific Islands or Australia. Eventually a new domestic terminal will also be built to the north to better utilize the new runway. The new runway will thus free up the longer southern runway to handle more heavy jet operations. { Event marks start of new runway for Auckland Airport (Auckland Airport Media Release, Thursday 4 October 2007. Retrieved 2008-01-09.) } The 10-year project would cost NZ$120 million, not including substantial extensions planned for the airport arrivals/departure buildings and associated structures. An extension to the international terminal has recently been completed to allow the Airbus A380 to dock. Emirates has started flying one of its A380s on the Auckland  — Dubai via Sydney route which commenced in May 2009.Emirates announced in December 2011 that they will replace their current B777-300ER aircraft used on the daily Dubai-Melbourne-Auckland route with a A380-800 from 1 October 2012. [ Terminals ] [ International Terminal ] Check-in counters are at the eastern end of the international terminal building on the ground level. Gates 1–10 are single-airbridge gates Gates 15 and 16 in the new pier extension are served by twin airbridges for wide-body aircraft; and are capable of handling A380 aircraft with simultaneous double-deck boarding Gates 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D and 5A are bus transportation gates Aerial view of the airport, 2008 [ Passenger separation ] Prior to 2006 Auckland Airport arriving and departing passengers were allowed to mingle airside. After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the airport operated with a CAA exemption that allowed this to continue, although flights to the US and all Qantas-operated flights (and for a short while Cathay Pacific flights) were restricted to leaving from gates where a secondary X-ray and metal detector inspection had been set up. This exemption expired in 2006. [ October 2007 ] Auckland Airport decided that rather than building a new sub-top level to stream arriving passengers (as at Beijing, Vancouver or Heathrow), they would build a new departures floor for passengers to &quot; drop down &quot; into the existing gate lounges on the first floor, which would be closed off from a central arrivals corridor by glass. [ Domestic Terminal ] The two previously separate domestic terminal buildings have now been connected by a common retail area. Jetstar has taken over the old Ansett New Zealand/Qantas/Pacific Blue domestic terminal with two check-in counters between the Jetstar and Air New Zealand check-in areas. Jetstar domestic services operate from gates 20, 21 and 23 (airbridge service). Air New Zealand mainline services operate from gates 28-33 (airbridge service with the exceptions of gates 24 and 28 which are tarmac gates. 31 is both airbridge and tarmac); its regional services operated by propeller aircraft from the regional section of the domestic terminal gates 34-48 (excluding gate numbers 35 37 38 41 and 44 which do not exist) at the eastern end. These gates are linked by covered walkways to the terminal, and passengers walk across the apron to the aircraft.

It had previously been run by the Auckland Regional Authority, covering the five councils in the Auckland region. The Government was AIAL’s majority shareholder, the rest being held by the local councils. In 1998 the Government sold its shareholding, and AIAL became the fifth airport company in the world to be publicly listed. At that time the major shareholders were Auckland City Council (25.8%), Manukau City Council (9.6%) and North Shore City Council (7.1%). North Shore City Council sold its shares in 1999 and Auckland City Council sold its share down to 12.8% in 2002. AIAL appears on the New Zealand Stock Exchange ( [ AIA ] ) and Australian Stock Exchange ( [ AIA ] ). International shareholders hold around 40% of the shares, domestic approximately 60%. [ November 2007 ] The company has a Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s credit rating of A+/Stable/A-1. [ http://www.standardandpoors.com Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s ] AIAL enjoys diverse revenue streams, and operates a &apos;dual-till&apos; approach, whereby its finances are split into aeronautical and non-aeronautical balance sheets. Aeronautical income is derived from airfield charges, terminal services charge and the airport development charge (or departure fee). Non-aeronautical revenue comes from its significant property portfolio, car park, and retail income. Income from the non-aeronautical side of the business accounts for just over half of its revenue. The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high landing charges. However research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below the average of the 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand. Further research by aviation consultants Airbiz conducted in August 2010 indicates that Auckland Airport domestic landing charges are amongst the lowest in Australasia. The diversity in revenue was of benefit during the downturn in international aviation following the events of 11  September 2001, and subsequently the 2002 Bali bombings, SARS outbreak and the Iraq War. The airport was able to rely on steady income from the non-aeronautical side of the business, which softened the blow of international events. In addition, New Zealand retained favour among the world’s travellers as a safe destination. In July 2009 Auckland Airport elected to delay a scheduled increase in its landing charges from 1 July 2009 to assist its airline customers during the recession. The scheduled increase was put in place on 1 March 2010. The company has in the past reportedly been singled out by airline lobby group IATA for its consistent excessive level of profits. Airlines such as Air New Zealand complain of excessive landing charges. { Remarks by Giovanni Bisignani - Global Press Briefing, Geneva: Auckland is an example (from an } { IATA press release, 2006-12-01. Retrieved 2007-11-11.) } On 5 June 2007, the airport&apos;s 60% profit margin was criticised by IATA director general and CEO Giovanni Bisignani. He said the airport had a &quot; happy monopoly &quot; and that IATA would ask the New Zealand government to investigate.

This has been replaced with a passenger services charge levied on the airlines for each arriving and departing international passenger. This charge has commenced at $13 and will rise by 50 cents a year for two years to $14.

The shareholding will cost NZ$27.7 million, through the issue of new shares. The alliance is expected to generate an extra 176,000 passengers through Queenstown Airport. AIAL has an option to increase its shareholding in Queenstown Airport to 30-35% at any time up to 30 June 2011, subject to the approval of the Queenstown Lakes District Council. The new share capital from would allow Queenstown Airport to fund growth of the airport&apos;s operating capacity and to pay regular dividends back to the community via the Queenstown Lakes District Council shareholding.

A free shuttle bus connects the international and domestic terminals to each other; they are also linked by a walkway. Two state highways connect to the airport: State Highway 20A and State Highway 20B. State Highway 20A leaves the airport to the north and allows access to central Auckland, the western and northern suburbs, and Northland. State Highway 20B leaves the airport to the east and allows access to southern and eastern Auckland, and the rest of the North Island. Currently, there is no direct motorway access to the airport, and at some point, airport traffic must use Auckland city streets. The completion of the State Highway 20 Manukau Extension in 2010 has allowed motorway access to the State Highway 1 via State Highway 20B. In light traffic, a trip to the central city takes around 40 – 45 minutes. Taxis and shuttles are available at both terminals.
