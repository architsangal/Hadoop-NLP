In reference to the visible spectrum cyan is used to refer to the color obtained by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light or the removal of red from white light. As such, cyan is the complement of red in RGB and CMYK color model s : cyan pigment s absorb red light. Cyan is also called aqua or blue-green, and was formerly known as &quot; cyan blue &quot;.

Hatt D.

[ Electric cyan vs. process cyan ] [ Electric cyan (web color aqua) ] [ Cyan (additive secondary) 00FFFF 0 255 255 100 0 0 0 180 100 100 ] The vivid cyan that is seen on an electronic display device (shown at right) is also referred to as electric cyan to distinguish it from the less vivid turquoise blue-like process cyan used in CMYK color printing (shown below). (Note: while the color is defined by definite RGB values, the display of the color will vary depending on the absolute color space used and the nature of the physical display device, e.g. computer monitor, and if this page is printed it is likely that the color shown will be far from representative.) The web color aqua is an alias for electric cyan, that is, it is exactly the same color shown here as electric cyan. To reproduce electric cyan in inks, it is necessary to add some white ink to the printer&apos;s cyan below, so when it is reproduced in printing, it is not a primary subtractive color. It is called aqua (a name in use since 1598) because it is a color commonly associated with water, such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach. { Maerz and Paul The Dictionary of Color 1930 (see under Aqua in Index, page 189) } [ Process cyan (pigment cyan) (printer&apos;s cyan) ] [ Cyan (subtractive primary) 00B7EB 0 183 235 100 22 0 8 193 100 92 Using HSL color space#Conversion from RGB to HSL or HSV, v=247/255 ] Cyan is also one of the common inks used in four-color printing, along with magenta, yellow, and black; this set of colors is referred to as CMYK as in spectrum(s). While both the additive secondary and the subtractive primary are called cyan, they can be substantially different from one another. Cyan printing ink can be more saturated or less saturated than the RGB secondary cyan, depending on what RGB color space and ink are considered. Process cyan is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer&apos;s ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure cyan ink. A typical formulation of process cyan is shown in the color box at right.

However, it does absorb slightly more red light than blue, giving large volumes of water a bluish tint; increased scattering of blue light due to fine particles in the water shifts the blue color toward green, for a typically cyan net color. Cyanide derives its name from Prussian blue, a blue pigment containing the cyanide ion.
