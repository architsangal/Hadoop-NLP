[ African bush elephant ] [ 11500010 91 ] { VU } { iucn3.1 } { Loxodonta cyclotis } { Loxodonta cyclotis } { ( } { Matschie, 1900) } { Loxodonta cyclotis map.svg } { African forest elephant range } The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is a forest dwelling elephant of the Congo Basin. Formerly considered either a synonym or a subspecies of the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana), a 2010 study established that the two are distinct species. The disputed pygmy elephant s of the Congo basin, often assumed to be a separate species (Loxodonta pumilio) by cryptozoologists, are probably forest elephants whose diminutive size and/or early maturity is due to environmental conditions.

Differences include the African forest elephant&apos;s long, narrow mandible (the African bush elephant&apos;s is short and wide), its rounded ears (an African bush elephant&apos;s ears are more pointed), straighter and downward tusk s, considerably smaller size, and number of toenails. The male African forest elephant rarely exceeds 2.5 metres (8  ft) in height, while the African bush elephant is usually over 3 metres (just under 10 feet) and sometimes almost 4 metres (13  ft) tall. With regard to the number of toenails: the African Bush Elephant normally has 4 toenails on the frontfoot and 3 on the hindfoot, the African forest elephant normally has 5 toenails on the frontfoot and 4 on the hindfoot (like the Asian elephant ), but hybrids between the two species occur. The African forest elephant is a herbivore and commonly eats leaves, fruit, and bark, with occasional visits to mineral lick s. It eats a high proportion of fruit and is sometimes the only disperser of some tree species such as Balanites wilsoniana and Omphalocarpum spp. Owing to poaching and the high demand for ivory, the African forest elephant population approached critical levels in the 1990s and early 2000s.

It had long been known that the ivory of the African forest elephant was particularly hard, with a pinkish tinge, and straight (whereas that of the African bush elephant is curved). The DNA tests, however, indicated that the two populations were much more different than previously appreciated — indeed, in its genetic makeup, the African forest elephant is almost two-thirds as distinct from the African bush elephant as the Asian elephant is.
