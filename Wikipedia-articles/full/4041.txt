Bede&apos;s monastery had access to a superb library which included works by Eusebius and Orosius among many others. He is well known as an author and scholar, and his most famous work, Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) gained him the title &quot; The Father of English History &quot;. In 1899, Bede was made a Doctor of the Church by Leo XIII, a position of theological significance; he is the only native of Great Britain to achieve this designation ( Anselm of Canterbury, also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from Italy). Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, and his work with the Latin and Greek writings of the early Church Fathers contributed significantly to English Christianity, making the writings much more accessible to his fellow Anglo-Saxons. [ Life ] { St. Bede&apos;s school, Chennai ) } Almost everything that is known of Bede&apos;s life is contained in the last chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica, a history of the church in England. It was completed in about 731, { Brooks &quot; From British to English Christianity &quot; Conversion and Colonization p. 5 } and Bede implies that he was then in his fifty-ninth year, which would give a likely birth date of about 672–673. [ Ray 2001 57–59 ] { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, p.  xix. } { Campbell &quot; Bede &quot; Oxford Dictionary of National Biography } [ Bede&apos;s words are &quot; Ex quo tempore accepti presbyteratus usque ad annum aetatis meae LVIIII... &quot;; which means &quot; From the time I became a priest until the fifty-ninth year of my life I have made it my business... to make brief extracts from the works of the venerable fathers on the holy Scriptures... &quot; Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  566 –567. Other, less plausible, interpretations of this passage have been suggested —for example that it means Bede stopped writing about scripture in his fifty-ninth year. Whiting, &quot; The Life of the Venerable Bede &quot;, in Thompson, &quot; Bede: His Life, Times and Writing &quot;, p.  4. notes ] A minor source of information is the letter by his disciple Cuthbert [ not the Saint Cuthbert, who Bede writes about in book IV of his Ecclesiastical History notes ] which relates Bede&apos;s death. [ Cuthbert is probably the same person as the later abbot of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, but this is not entirely certain. notes ] Bede, in the Historia, gives his birthplace as &quot; on the lands of this monastery &quot;. { Bede, Ecclesiastical History, V.24, p.  329. } He is referring to the twinned monasteries of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow, [ Farmer 1978 19–20 ] near modern-day Newcastle, claimed as his birthplace, there is also a tradition that he was born at Monkton, two miles from the monastery at Jarrow. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  xix –xx. } Bede says nothing of his origins, but his connections with men of noble ancestry suggest that his own family was well-to-do. [ Blair 1990 4 ] Bede&apos;s first abbot was Benedict Biscop, and the names &quot; Biscop &quot; and &quot; Beda &quot; both appear in a king list of the kings of Lindsey from around 800, further suggesting that Bede came from a noble family. The name &quot; Bede &quot; was not a common one at the time. The Liber Vitae of Durham Cathedral includes a list of priests; two are named Bede, and one of these is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the Life of Cuthbert, one of Bede&apos;s own works, mention that Cuthbert&apos;s own priest was named Bede; it is possible that this priest is the other name listed in the Liber Vitae. These occurrences, along with a Bieda who is mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle under the year 501, are the only appearances of the name in early sources. { Swanton Anglo-Saxon Chronicle pp. 14 –15 } The name probably derives from the Old English bēd, or prayer; if Bede was given the name at his birth, then his family had probably always planned for him to enter the clergy. At the age of seven, he was sent to the monastery of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. [ Blair 1990 178 ] Bede does not say whether it was already intended at that point that he would be a monk. [ Blair 1990 241 ] It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, p.  xx. } Monkwearmouth&apos;s sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. [ Farmer 1978 20 ] The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The Life of Ceolfrith, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith and was &quot; now a priest of the same monastery &quot;. After a week of singing the psalms without the usual antiphon s, Ceolfrith &quot; could not bear it any longer &quot;, and the two managed to restore the usual service, &quot; with no little labour &quot;. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14. { Plummer, Bedae Opera Historica, vol. I, p.  xii. } When Bede was about 17 years old, Adomnan, the abbot of Iona Abbey, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would probably have met the abbot during this visit, and it may be that Adomnan sparked Bede&apos;s interest in the Easter dating controversy. [ Blair 1990 181 ] In about 692, in Bede&apos;s nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a deacon by his diocesan bishop, John, who was bishop of Hexham. The canonical age for the ordination of a deacon was 25; Bede&apos;s early ordination may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional, but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded. [ Blair 1990 5 ] There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices. [ Blair 1990 253 ] { notes } In Bede&apos;s thirtieth year (about 702) Bede became a priest, with the ordination again performed by Bishop John. In about 701 Bede wrote his first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were intended for use in the classroom. He continued to write for the rest of his life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all of his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library; it is known as the Codex Laudianus. [ Blair 1990 234 ] [ http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley/library/specialcollections/western_rarebooks/medieval Classical and Medieval MSS 30 December 2010 Bodleian Library ] Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. { A few pages from another copy are held by the } { British Museum. } [ Farmer 1978 20 ] Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; [ Ray 2001 57 ] he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment of some kind, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is quite uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint&apos;s works. { Whiting, &quot; The Life of the Venerable Bede &quot;, in Thompson, &quot; Bede: His Life, Times and Writing &quot;, pp.  5 –6. } { Dorothy Whitelock, &quot; Bede and his Teachers and Friends &quot;, in Bonner, Famulus Christi, p.  21. } [ The key phrase is per linguae curationem, which is variously translated as &quot; how his tongue was healed &quot;, &quot; [a] canker on the tongue &quot;, or, following a different interpretation of curationem, &quot; the guidance of my tongue &quot;. notes ] In 708, some monks at Hexham accused Bede of having committed heresy in his work De Temporibus. [ Blair 1990 267 ] The standard theological view of world history at the time was known as the six ages of the world; in his book, Bede calculated the age of the world for himself, rather than accepting the authority of Isidore of Seville, and came to the conclusion that Christ had been born 3,952 years after the creation of the world, rather than the figure of over 5,000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians. { Hurst, Bede the Venerable, p.  38. } The accusation occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham of the time, Wilfrid, who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made the accusation. Wilfrid did not respond to the accusation, but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede, who replied within a few days to the monk, writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter be read to Wilfrid also. [ The letter itself is in Bedae Opera de Temporibusedited by C. W. Jones, pp. 307 –315 notes ] Bede had another brush with Wilfrid, for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid, sometime between 706 and 709, and discussed Æthelthryth, the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor. { Goffart Narrators p. 322 } Bede&apos;s tomb in Durham Cathedral In 733, Bede travelled to York, to visit Ecgbert, who was then bishop of York. The see of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, and it is likely that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey. [ Blair 1990 305 ] Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne, and at some point visited the otherwise unknown monastery of a monk named [ y Wicthed ], a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and due to the fact that many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed. [ Higham 2006 15 ] It seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, as he would have mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, p.  566, n. } Nothhelm, a correspondent of Bede&apos;s who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm&apos;s visit to Rome. { Plummer, Bedae Opera Historica, vol. II, p.  3. } Bede died on Thursday, 26 May 735 ( Ascension Day ) and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede&apos;s, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), describing Bede&apos;s last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill &quot; with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain &quot;, before Easter. On the Tuesday before Acension Day (26 May) his breathing became worse, and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o&apos;clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery &quot; a few treasures &quot; of his: &quot; some pepper, and napkins, and some incense &quot;. That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  580 –587. } Cuthbert&apos;s letter also relates a five-line poem in the vernacular that Bede composed on his deathbed, known as &quot; Bede&apos;s Death Song &quot;. It is the most widely copied Old English poem, and appears in 45 manuscripts, but its attribution to Bede is not absolutely certain —not all manuscripts name Bede as the author, and the ones that do are of later origin than those that do not. { Donald Scragg, &quot; Bede&apos;s Death Song &quot;, in Lapidge, Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.  59. } { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  580 –581, note. } Bede&apos;s remains may have been transferred to Durham Cathedral in the 11th century; his tomb there was looted in 1541, but the contents were probably re-interred in the Galilee chapel at the cathedral. One further oddity in his writings is that in one of his works, the Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles, he writes in a manner that gives the impression he was married. [ Higham 2006 8–9 ] The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first-person view. Bede says: &quot; Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray. &quot; { Quoted in Ward Venerable Bede p. 57 } Another passage, in the Commentary on Luke, also mentions a wife in the first person: &quot; Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ. &quot; The historian Benedicta Ward argues that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device. { Ward Venerable Baede p. 57 } [ Works ] [ List of works by Bede ] Depiction of the Venerable Bede (on CLVIIIv) from the Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493 Bede wrote scientific, historical and theological works, reflecting the range of his writings from music and metrics to exegetical Scripture commentaries. He knew patristic literature, as well as Pliny the Elder, Virgil, Lucretius, Ovid, Horace and other classical writers. He knew some Greek and Hebrew [ November 2010 ]. His Latin is generally clear, but his Biblical commentaries are more technical. Bede&apos;s scriptural commentaries employed the allegorical method of interpretation { Holder (trans.), Bede: On the Tabernacle, (Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 1994), pp. xvii –xx. } and his history includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the materials in his history. Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of Early Medieval scholars. { McClure and Collins, The Ecclesiastical History, pp. xviii –xix. } He dedicated his work on the Apocalypse and the De Temporum Ratione to the successor of Ceolfrid as abbot, Hwaetbert. [ Blair 1990 187 ] Modern historians have completed many studies of Bede&apos;s works. His life and work have been celebrated by a series of annual scholarly lectures at St. Paul&apos;s Church, Jarrow from 1958 to the present. { The Jarrow Lecture } The historian Walter Goffart says of Bede that he &quot; holds a privileged and unrivalled place among first historians of Christian Europe &quot;. { Goffart Narrators p. 236 } Although Bede is mainly studied as a historian now, in his time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works. The non-historical works contributed greatly to the Carolingian renaissance. { Goffart Narrators pp. 242 –243 } [ Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ] [ Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ] Bede&apos;s best-known work is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, or An Ecclesiastical History of the English People. [ Farmer 1978 21 ] Completed in about 731, [ The traditional date is 731, which Bede gives himself. However, a Muslim defeat in Gaul that took place in 732 appears to be recorded, which gives some fuzziness to the ending date. Goffart Narrators p. 242 and footnote 36 notes ], Bede was aided in writing this book by Albinus, abbot of St Augustine&apos;s Abbey, Canterbury. [ Albinus ] The first of the five books begins with some geographical background, and then sketches the history of England, beginning with Caesar&apos;s invasion in 55 BC. [ Farmer 1978 22 ] A brief account of Christianity in Roman Britain, including the martyrdom of St Alban, is followed by the story of Augustine &apos;s mission to England in 597, which brought Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons. The second book begins with the death of Gregory the Great in 604, and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria. [ Farmer 1978 31 ] These ended in disaster when Penda, the pagan king of Mercia, killed the newly Christian Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in about 632. The setback was temporary, and the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings Oswald of Northumbria and Oswy. [ Farmer 1978 31–32 ] The climax of the third book is the account of the Council of Whitby, traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history. [ Abels 1983 1–2 ] The fourth book begins with the consecration of Theodore as Archbishop of Canterbury, and recounts Wilfrid &apos;s efforts to bring Christianity to the kingdom of Sussex. [ Farmer 1978 32 ] The fifth book brings the story up to Bede&apos;s day, and includes an account of missionary work in Frisia, and of the conflict with the British church over the correct dating of Easter. Bede wrote a preface for the work, in which he dedicates it to Ceolwulf, king of Northumbria. { Bede, &quot; Preface &quot;, Historia Ecclesiastica, p.  41. } The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book; presumably Ceolwulf knew enough Latin to understand it, and he may even have been able to read it. The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy, and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf&apos;s approval; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede&apos;s monastery had excellent connections among the Northumbrian nobility. [ Sources ] The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an excellent library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede&apos;s day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning. { Cramp, &quot; Monkwearmouth (or Wearmouth) and Jarrow &quot;, pp.  325–326. } It has been estimated that there were about 200 books in the monastic library. { Michael Lapidge, &quot; Libraries &quot;, in Lapidge, Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, pp.  286 –287. } For the period prior to Augustine&apos;s arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, including Solinus. [ Farmer 1978 25 ] He had access to two works of Eusebius : the Historia Ecclesiastica, and also the Chronicon, though he had neither in the original Greek; instead he had a Latin translation of the Historia, by Rufinus, and Saint Jerome&apos;s translation of the Chronicon. { Campbell, &quot; Bede &quot;, in Dorey, Latin Historians, p.  162. } He also knew Orosius &apos;s Adversus Paganus, and Gregory of Tours &apos; Historia Francorum, both Christian histories, as well as the work of Eutropius, a pagan historian. { Campbell, &quot; Bede &quot;, in Dorey, Latin Historians, p.  163. } He used Constantius &apos;s Life of Germanus as a source for Germanus &apos;s visits to Britain. Bede&apos;s account of the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons is drawn largely from Gildas &apos;s De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae. { Lapidge, &quot; Gildas &quot;, p.  204. } Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as Eddius Stephanus &apos;s Life of Wilfrid, and anonymous Lives of Gregory the Great and Cuthbert. He also drew on Josephus &apos;s Antiquities, and the works of Cassiodorus, { Meyvaert &quot; Bede &quot; Speculum p. 831 } and there was a copy of the Liber Pontificalis in Bede&apos;s monastery. { Meyvaert &quot; Bede &quot; Speculum p. 843 } Bede quotes from several classical authors, including Cicero, Plautus, and Terence, but he may have had access to their work via a Latin grammar rather than directly. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  xxv –xxvi. } However, it is clear he was familiar with the works of Virgil and with Pliny the Elder &apos;s Natural History, and his monastery also owned copies of the works of Dionysius Exiguus. He probably drew his account of St. Alban from a life of that saint which has not survived. He acknowledges two other lives of saints directly; one is a life of Fursa, and the other of St. Æthelburh; the latter no longer survives. { Plummer, Bedae Opera Historic, vol. I, p. xxiv. } He also had access to a life of Ceolfrith. { Campbell, &quot; Bede &quot;, in Dorey, Latin Historians, p.  164. } Some of Bede&apos;s material came from oral traditions, including a description of the physical appearance of Paulinus of York, who had died nearly 90 years before Bede&apos;s Historia Ecclesiastica was written. Bede also had correspondents who supplied him with material. Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great &apos;s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine&apos;s mission. { Keynes, &quot; Nothhelm &quot;, pp.  335  336. } Almost all of Bede&apos;s information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the Historia Ecclesiastica; { Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, Preface, p.  42. } he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey. The historian Walter Goffart argues that Bede based the structure of the Historia on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used Gildas &apos;s De excidio. The second section, detailing the Gregorian mission of Augustine of Canterbury was framed on the anonymous Life of Gregory the Great written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on Stephen of Ripon &apos;s Life of Wilfrid. { Goffart Narrators pp. 296 –307 } Most of Bede&apos;s informants for information after Augustine&apos;s mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence. { Brooks &quot; From British to English Christianity &quot; Conversion and Colonization pp. 7 –10 } { Brooks &quot; From British to English Christianity &quot; Conversion and Colonization pp. 12 –14 } [ Models and style ] Bede&apos;s stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius, and his title is an echo of Eusebius&apos;s Historia Ecclesiastica. Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the Acts of the Apostles as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the Acts as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church. [ Farmer 1978 26 ] Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done. Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms &quot; Australes &quot; and &quot; Occidentales &quot; for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses &quot; Meridiani &quot; and &quot; Occidui &quot; instead, as perhaps his informant had done. At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from Gregory of Tours &apos; earlier History of the Franks. [ Farmer 1978 27 ] Bede&apos;s work as a hagiographer, and his detailed attention to dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the Historia Ecclesiastica. His interest in computus, the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date. Bede&apos;s Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the Historia Ecclesiastica is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as Aldhelm, whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede&apos;s own text is easy to read. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  xxxvii –xxxviii. } In the words of Charles Plummer, one of the best-known editors of the Historia Ecclesiastica, Bede&apos;s Latin is &quot; clear and limpid... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style. &quot; { Plummer, Bedae Opera Historica, vol. I, pp.  liii –liv. } [ Intent ] Bede&apos;s primary intention in writing the Historia Ecclesiastica was to show the growth of the united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede&apos;s ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; by the end of the Historia the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  xxx –xxxi. } This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede&apos;s animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the Historia is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote. Bede&apos;s extensive use of miracles is disconcerting to the modern reader who thinks of Bede as a more or less reliable historian, but men of the time accepted miracles as a matter of course. However, Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the Historia, felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  xxxiv –xxxvi. } [ Omissions and biases ] Bede is somewhat reticent about the career of Wilfrid, a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid&apos;s opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede&apos;s monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid&apos;s life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede&apos;s theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church. Bede&apos;s account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the channel from Britain to Brittany described by Procopius, who was writing in the sixth century. Frank Stenton describes this omission as &quot; a scholar&apos;s dislike of the indefinite &quot;; traditional material that could not be dated or used for the Bede&apos;s didactic purposes had no interest for him. { Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp.  8 –9. } Bede was a Northumbrian, and this tinged his work with a local bias. { Wallace-Hadrill, Historical Commentary, p.  xxxi. } The sources he had access to gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas. { Yorke, The Conversion of Britain, p.  119. } He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of Boniface, a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm, a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held imperium, or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, Ceawlin, is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. { Yorke, The Conversion of Britain, pp.  21 –22. } Bede relates the story of Augustine&apos;s mission from Rome, and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. This, combined with Gildas&apos;s negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, led Bede to a very critical view of the native church. However, Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine&apos;s mission, the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest, which, in the words of Barbara Yorke, would have naturally &quot; curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British clergy. &quot; { Yorke, The Conversion of Britain, p.  118. } [ Use of Anno Domini ] At the time Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, there were two common ways of referring to dates. One was to use indiction s, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years —the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the anno domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. { Colgrave &amp; Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp.  xviii –xix. } Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. { Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.  186. } [ Assessment ] The Historia Ecclesiastica was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than on the British Isles. Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede&apos;s Historia come from the northern parts of the Carolingian Empire. [ Higham 2006 21 ] This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at Strasbourg, France. { Wright Companion to Bede pp. 4 –5 } Modern historians have studied the Historia extensively, and a number of editions have been produced. For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the Historia, but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the Historia was the culmination of Bede&apos;s works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars. { Goffart Narrators pp. 238 –9 } Modern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the Historia Ecclesiastica. Stenton regarded it as one of the &quot; small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place &quot;, and regarded its quality as dependent on Bede&apos;s &quot; astonishing power of co-ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition, the relation of friends, or documentary evidence... In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact, he had reached the conception of history. &quot; { Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.  187. } The Historia Ecclesiastica has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history. His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church. Besides the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the medieval writers William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, and Geoffrey of Monmouth used his works as sources and inspirations. [ Higham 2006 27 ] Early modern writers, such as Polydore Virgil and Matthew Parker, the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the Historia, and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion. [ Higham 2006 33 ] Some historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede&apos;s accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the Historia&apos;s account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede&apos;s time. { Behr &quot; Origins of Kingship &quot; Early Medieval Europe pp. 25 –52 } It is likely that Bede&apos;s work, because it was so widely copied, discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works. { Plummer, Bedae Opera Historica, vol. I, p.  xlvii and note. } [ Other historical works ] { King Athelstan presenting the work to the saint. This manuscript was given to St. Cuthbert&apos;s shrine in 934. Cannon Oxford Illustrated History pp. 42 –43 } [ Chronicles ] As Chapter 66 of his On the Reckoning of Time, in 725 Bede wrote the Greater Chronicle (chronica maiora), which sometimes circulated as a separate work. For recent events the Chronicle, like his Ecclesiastical History, relied upon Gildas, upon a version of the Liber pontificalis current at least to the papacy of Pope Sergius I (687 –701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on Eusebius &apos;s Chronikoi Kanones. The dating of events in the Chronicle is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the anno mundi. { Wallis (trans.), The Reckoning of Time, pp. lxvii –lxxi, 157 –237, 353 –66 } [ Lives ] His other historical works included lives of the abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow, as well as verse and prose lives of Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, an adaptation of Paulinus of Nola &apos;s Life of St Felix, and a translation of the Greek Passion of St Anastasius. He also created a listing of saints, the Martyrology. { Goffart Narrators pp. 245 –246 } [ Theological works ] In his own time, Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, as well as other theological works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost. [ Brown 1987 42 ] It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum, and why he was made a saint. { Ward &quot; Bede the Theologian &quot; The Medieval Theologians pp. 57 –64 } Bede was not an innovative religious thinker. He made no original writings or thoughts on the beliefs of the church, instead working to synthesise and transmit the learning from his predecessors. In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of Jerome &apos;s Vulgate, which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by Basil, Cassian, John Chrysostom, Isidore of Seville, Origen, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, Pope Gregory I, Ambrose of Milan, Cassiodorus, and Cyprian. He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works. He had a Latin translation by Evagrius of Athanasius &apos;s Life of Antony, and a copy of Sulpicius Severus &apos; Life of St. Martin. He also used lesser known writers, such as Fulgentius, Julian of Eclanum, Tyconius, and Prosperius. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin Fathers of the Church. { Ward Venerable Bede p. 44 } It is clear from Bede&apos;s own comments that he felt his job was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers. { Meyvaert &quot; Bede &quot; Speculum p. 827 } Bede also wrote homilies, works written to explain theology used in worship services. Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian seasons such as Advent, Lent, or Easter, but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events. Both types of Bede&apos;s theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the Glossa Ordinaria, an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries. Some of Bede&apos;s homilies were collected by Paul the Deacon, and they were used in that form in the Monastic Office. Saint Boniface used Bede&apos;s homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent. Bede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave the details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books that he must have had access to by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers –he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny&apos;s Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione. { M.L.W. Laistner, &quot; The Library of the Venerable Bede &quot;, in A.H. Thompson, &quot; Bede: His Life, Times and Writings &quot;, pp.  237 –262. } [ Laistner provides a list of works definitely or tentatively identified as in Bede&apos;s library. M.L.W. Laistner, &quot; The Library of the Venerable Bede &quot;, in A.H. Thompson, &quot; Bede: His Life, Times and Writings &quot;, pp.  263 –266. notes ] [ Works on the Old Testament ] The works dealing with the Old Testament included Commentary on Samuel, { Ward Venerable Bede p. 67 } Commentary on Genesis, { Ward Venerable Bede p. 68 } Commentaries on Ezra and Nehemiah, On the Temple, On the Tabernacle, { Ward Venerable Bede p. 72 } Commentaries on Tobit, Commentaries on Proverbs, Commentaries on the Song of Songs, Commentaries on the Canticle of Habakkuk, { Ward Venerable Bede p. 74 } The works on Ezra, the Tabernacle and the Temple were especially influenced by Gregory the Great&apos;s writings. [ Thacker 1998 80 ] He was also the one responsible for replacing the title God in the Hebrew texts to read &apos;Lord of Hosts.&apos; [ July 2010 ] [ Works on the New Testament ] Bede&apos;s works included Commentary on Revelation, { Ward Venerable Bede p. 51 } Commentary on the Catholic Epistles, { Ward Venerable Bede p. 56 } Commentary on Acts, Reconsideration on the Books of Acts, { Ward Venerable Bede pp. 58 –59 } On the Gospel of Mark, On the Gospel of Luke, and Homilies on the Gospels. { Ward Venerable Bede p. 60 } At the tme of his death he was working on a translation of the Gospel of St. John into English. { Loyn Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest p. 270 } [ Works on historical and astronomical chronology ] De temporibus, or On Time, written in about 703, provides an introduction to the principles of Easter computus. [ Brown 1987 37 ] This was based on parts of Isidore of Seville &apos;s Etymologies, and Bede also include a chronology of the world which was derived from Eusebius, with some revisions based on Jerome&apos;s translation of the bible. In about 723, Bede wrote a longer work on the same subject, On the Reckoning of Time, which was influential throughout the Middle Ages. [ Brown 1987 38–41 ] He also wrote several shorter letters and essays discussing specific aspects of computus. On the Reckoning of Time ( De temporum ratione ) included an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the cosmos, including an explanation of how the spherical earth influenced the changing length of day light, of how the season al motion of the Sun and Moon influenced the changing appearance of the New Moon at evening twilight, and a quantitative relation between the changes of the Tides at a given place and the daily motion of the moon. { Wallis (trans.), The Reckoning of Time, pp. 82 –85, 307 –312 } Since the focus of his book was calculation, Bede gave instructions for computing the date of Easter and the related time of the Easter Full Moon, for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the zodiac, and for many other calculations related to the calendar. He gives some information about the months of the Anglo-Saxon calendar in chapter XV. { Wallis (trans.), The Reckoning of Time 15, pp. 53 –4, 285 –7; see also } Any codex of Bede&apos;s Easter cycle is normally found together with a codex of his &quot; De Temporum Ratione &quot;. For calendric purposes, Bede made a new calculation of the age of the world since the creation, which he dated as 3952 BC. Due to his innovations in computing the age of the world, he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfrid, his chronology being contrary to accepted calculations. Once informed of the accusations of these &quot; lewd rustics, &quot; Bede refuted them in his Letter to Plegwin. { Wallis (trans.),, The Reckoning of Time, pp. xxx, 405 –415 } In addition to these works on astronomical timekeeping, he also wrote De natura rerum, or On the Nature of Things, modelled in part after the work of the same title by Isidore of Seville. [ Brown 1987 36 ] His works were so influential that late in the 9th century Notker the Stammerer, a monk of the Monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland, wrote that &quot; God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth &quot;. { Wallis (trans.), The Reckoning of Time, p. lxxxv } [ Educational works ] Bede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school. One of these was his De arte metrica, a discussion of the composition of Latin verse, drawing on previous grammarians work. It was based on Donatus&apos; De pedibus and Servius&apos; De finalibus, and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil. It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries. Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert, apparently a student, for he is named &quot; beloved son &quot; in the dedication, and Bede says &quot; I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes &quot; [ Brown 1987 31–32 ] Another textbook of Bede&apos;s is the De orthographia, a work on orthography, designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works. Although it could serve as a textbook, it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work. The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown. [ Brown 1987 35–36 ] Another educational work is De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae, which discusses the Bible&apos;s use of rhetoric. Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil, but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in De schematibus... Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. { Colgrave gives the example of Desiderius of Vienne, who was reprimanded by Gregory the Great for using &quot; heathen &quot; authors in his teaching. } Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples. [ Vernacular poetry ] According to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was also doctus in nostris carminibus ( &quot; learned in our songs &quot; ). Cuthbert&apos;s letter on Bede&apos;s death, the Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae, moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as Bede’s Death Song And he used to repeat that sentence from St. Paul “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,” and many other verses of Scripture, urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour. And in our own language,—for he was familiar with English poetry,—speaking of the soul’s dread departure from the body: Facing that enforced journey, no man can be More prudent than he has good call to be, If he consider, before his going hence, What for his spirit of good hap or of evil After his day of death shall be determined. Fore ðæm nedfere nænig wiorðe ðonc snottora ðon him ðearf siæ to ymbhycgenne ær his hinionge hwæt his gastæ godes oððe yfles æfter deað dæge doemed wiorðe.: Colgrave and Mynors, Bede&apos;s Ecclesiastical History, pp. 580 –3 As Opland notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the letter do not use a finite verb to describe Bede&apos;s presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert&apos;s description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts. { Opland, Anglo-Saxon Oral Poetry, pp. 140 –141 } On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert’s Latin letter, the observation that Bede &quot; was learned in our song, &quot; and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment { McCready, Miracles and the Venerable Bede, pp. 14 –19 } or because it is a direct quotation of Bede’s last original composition. { See Jeff Opland, Anglo-Saxon Oral Poetry, pp. 140 –141 for a discussion } [ Veneration ] There is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. One reason for this may be that he died on the feast day of Augustine of Canterbury. Later, when he was venerated in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly through the efforts of Saint Boniface and Alcuin, both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede&apos;s theological works. Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede&apos;s pupil Egbert, praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede&apos;s works to all of Alcuin&apos;s friends. { Ward Venerable Bede pp. 136 –138 } Bede&apos;s cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism, and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester (c. 1008 –1095) was a particular devotee of Bede&apos;s, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan&apos;s first undertaking after his consecration as bishop. { Ward Venerable Bede p. 139 } His body was stolen from Jarrow and transferred to Durham Cathedral around 1020, where it was placed in the same tomb with Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne. Later they were moved to a shrine in Galilee Chapel at Durham Cathedral in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation, but the bones were reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the bones were dug up and then reburied in a new tomb, which is still there. { Wright Companion to Bede p. 4 caption of the picture. } Other relic s were claimed by York, Glastonbury [ February 2009 ] and Fulda. [ Higham 2006 24 ] His scholarship and importance to Catholicism were recognised in 1899 when he was declared a Doctor of the Church, and was declared a sanctus in 1935. He is the only Englishman named a Doctor of the Church. He is also the only Englishman in Dante &apos;s Paradise ( Paradiso X.130), mentioned among theologians and doctors of the church in the same canto as Isidore of Seville and the Scot Richard of St. Victor. His feast day was included in the General Roman Calendar in 1899, for celebration on 27 May rather than on his date of death, 26 May which was then the feast day of Pope Saint Gregory VII; however, the 1969 calendar reforms allowed Bede&apos;s feast day to move to its proper day. [ January 2009 ] He is venerated in both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day of 25 May. Bede became known as Venerable Bede (Lat.: Beda Venerabilis) by the 9th century, { Wright Companion to Bede p. 3 } but this was not linked to consideration for sainthood by the Roman Catholic Church. According to a legend the epithet was miraculously supplied by angels, thus completing his unfinished epitaph. { Catholic Encyclopedia article &apos;&apos;The Venerable Bede&apos;&apos; } It is first utilised in connection with Bede in the 9th century, where Bede was grouped with others who were called &quot; venerable &quot; at two ecclesiastical councils held at Aix in 816 and 836. Paul the Deacon then referred to him as venerable consistently. By the 11th and 12th century, it had become commonplace. However, there are no descriptions of Bede by that term right after his death.
