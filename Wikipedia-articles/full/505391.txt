It has its headquarters in Swindon, England, and maintains significant administration centres in Bournemouth and Northampton. Until mid-2009, when it announced the withdrawal of the service, it had been the only UK financial institution to offer completely fee-free transactions (both electronic and cash withdrawals) worldwide with its VISA debit cards. Nationwide was by far the largest British building society that did not convert to a bank in the wave of demutualisation s that occurred from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. As of 2008, it is larger than all the other remaining British building societies combined, measured by total assets. { KPMG Building Societies Database 2008, page 3. } It is a member of the Building Societies Association, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and Co-operatives UK. Nationwide Building Society provides financial services both directly, and through around 700 branches. Nationwide is a major provider of both mortgage loan s and savings in the UK, as well as personal banking such as loans, credit cards, bank accounts and insurance products. Nationwide.co.uk is the main website and sells most products and has around 4.5 million monthly visitors and 1.9 million active internet bankers. The Society&apos;s origins lie in Wiltshire (1846), Northampton (1848) and within the co-operative movement in London (1883).

More significantly, it is the largest building society in the world and committed to staying mutual. The society is keen to emphasise that it does not have shareholders, it has members. In August 2007 the Society merged with Portman Building Society, creating a mutual body with assets of more than £160bn. In the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the Nationwide has acted to safeguard the mutual sector, acquiring the ailing Cheshire and Derbyshire building societies in September 2008 { Nationwide rescues small lenders BBC News, 8 September 2008 } { Nationwide, Derbyshire and Cheshire merger announcement Nationwide Building Society, 9 September 2008 } { Nationwide, Derbyshire and Cheshire merger announcement Derbyshire Building Society, 9 September 2008 } { Nationwide, Derbyshire and Cheshire merger announcement Cheshire Building Society, 9 September 2008 } and the Dunfermline Building Society on 30 March 2009.

The resolution is rejected by the Nationwide board on legal grounds. Cash machine surcharge campaigning in 1999 results in withdrawals from most cash machines owned by UK banks becoming free for customers of all banks and building societies throughout the UK. Nationwide Building Society, together with various UK tabloid newspaper s and media, launches a campaign against controversial cash machine fees. The campaign reaches a peak when Barclays Bank announces a plan to charge all customers of rival banks and financial providers, including those of Nationwide, £1 for every cash machine withdrawal made from a Barclays-owned cash machine. This prompts Nationwide Building Society to warn Barclays that it would take legal action against the bank if it did not back down. Nationwide claims Barclays has broken the rules of the LINK network of cash machines, which the bank had joined earlier the same year. Society members seeking a windfall, branded as carpetbaggers by the UK media, meant Nationwide members go to vote on whether to demutualise the society and float on the London Stock Exchange. The attempt fails, despite media reports of possible pay-outs to members of around £1,000 to £1,500 each, as Nationwide members vote by a narrow margin of 33,700 against converting the building society into a bank.
