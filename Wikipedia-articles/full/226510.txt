Greenblatt is regarded by many as one of the founders of New Historicism, a set of critical practices that he often refers to as &quot; cultural poetics &quot;; his works have been influential since the early 1980s when he introduced the term. Greenblatt has written and edited numerous books and articles relevant to new historicism, the study of culture, Renaissance studies and Shakespeare studies and is considered to be an expert in these fields. He is also co-founder of the literary-cultural journal Representations, which often publishes articles by new historicists. His most popular work is Will in the World, a biography of Shakespeare that was on the New York Times Best Seller List for nine weeks.

Rachel Donadio January 23, 2005 New York Times 2 March 2012 ] [ Life and career ] [ Education and career ] Greenblatt was born in Boston and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After graduating from Newton North High School, he was educated at Yale University ( B.A. 1964, M.Phil 1968, Ph.D. 1969) and Pembroke College, Cambridge ( B.A. 1966, M.A. 1968). Greenblatt has since taught at University of California, Berkeley and Harvard University. He was Class of 1932 Professor at Berkeley (he became a full professor in 1980) and taught there for 28 years before taking a position at Harvard University, where in 1997 Greenblatt became the Harry Levin Professor of Literature. He was named John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities in 2000. Greenblatt is considered &quot; a key figure in the shift from literary to cultural poetics and from textual to contextual interpretation in U.S. English departments in the 1980s and 1990s. &quot; [ Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism Vincent Leitch 2001 W. W. Norton New York 0-393-97429-4 2250 ] Greenblatt is a permanent fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin. As a visiting professor and lecturer, Greenblatt has taught at such institutions as the École des Hautes Études, the University of Florence, Kyoto University, the University of Oxford and Peking University. He was a resident fellow at the American Academy of Rome, and is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and has been president of the Modern Language Association. [ Family ] Greenblatt has three children. He was married to Ellen Schmidt from 1969–96; they have two sons (Joshua, an attorney, and Aaron, a doctor). In 1998 he married fellow academic Ramie Targoff, also a Renaissance expert and a professor at Brandeis University; they have one son (Harry). [ Work ] Greenblatt has written extensively on Shakespeare, the Renaissance, culture and new historicism (which he often refers to as &quot; cultural poetics &quot; ). Much of his work has been &quot; part of a collective project &quot;, such as his work as co-editor of the Berkeley-based literary-cultural journal Representations (which he co-founded in 1983), as editor of publications such as the Norton Anthology of English Literature and as co-author of books such as Practicing New Historicism (2000), which he wrote with Catherine Gallagher. Greenblatt has also written on such subjects as travelling in Laos and China, story-telling and miracle s. Greenblatt&apos;s collaboration with Charles L. Mee, Cardenio, premiered on May 8, 2008 at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While the critical response to Cardenio was mixed, audiences responded quite positively. The American Repertory Theatre has posted audience responses on the organization&apos;s blog. Cardenio has been adapted for performance in ten countries, with additional international productions planned. [ New Historicism ] Greenblatt first used the term “ new historicism ” in his 1982 introduction to The Power of Forms in the English Renaissance wherein he uses Queen Elizabeth&apos;s “bitter reaction to the revival of Shakespeare’s Richard II on the eve of the Essex rebellion &quot; to illustrate the “mutual permeability of the literary and the historical”. [ Greenblatt Stephen The Greenblatt Reader 2005 Wiley-Blackwell Hoboken 978-1-4051-1566-7 1–3 ] New historicism is regarded by many to have had an impact on &quot; every traditional period of English literary history”. [ http://litguide.press.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/view.cgi?eid%3D194%26amp%3Bquery%3Dgreenblatt#top New Historicism Cadzow Hunter Conway Alison Traister Bryce 2005 Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism 2 March 2012 ] Some critics have charged that it is “antithetical to literary and aesthetic value, that it reduces the historical to the literary or the literary to the historical, that it denies human agency and creativity, that it is somehow out to subvert the politics of cultural and critical theory [and] that it is anti-theoretical”. Others praise new historicism as “a collection of practices” employed by critics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of literature by considering it in historical context while treating history itself as “historically contingent on the present in which [it is] constructed”. In an interview with Matthew Norris, Greenblatt said that &quot; I didn’t imagine [New Historicism] as a program, or a long-range ten-year plan. Or a twenty-year plan. It was a way of trying to do a new kind of work. Of course, I hoped it would have an impact, but I wasn’t trying to start a school or imagining myself as founding a new movement. I imagined it as expressing this powerful sense that we need to try to do things differently. &quot; [ March 2012 ] When told that several American job advertisements were requesting responses from experts in new historicism, he remembered thinking &quot; &apos;You&apos;ve got to be kidding. You know it was just something we made up!&apos; I began to see there were institutional consequences to what seemed like a not particularly deeply thought-out term. &quot; [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/feb/26/biography The human factor Lucasta Miller 26 February 2005 The Guardian 2 March 2012 ] He has also said that “My deep, ongoing interest is in the relation between literature and history, the process through which certain remarkable works of art are at once embedded in a highly specific life-world and seem to pull free of that life-world. I am constantly struck by the strangeness of reading works that seem addressed, personally and intimately, to me, and yet were written by people who crumbled to dust long ago &quot;. [ http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2000/09.21/greenblatt.html Greenblatt Named University Professor of the Humanities 21 September 2000 Harvard University Gazette 2 March 2012 ] Greenblatt&apos;s works on new historicism and “cultural poetics” include Practicing New Historicism (2000) (with Catherine Gallagher ), in which Greenblatt discusses how “the anecdote… appears as the ‘touch of the real’” andTowards a Poetics of Culture (1987), in which Greenblatt asserts that the question of “how art and society are interrelated,” as posed by Jean-François Lyotard and Fredric Jameson, “cannot be answered by appealing to a single theoretical stance”. Renaissance Self-Fashioning and the Introduction to the Norton Shakespeare are regarded as good examples of Greenblatt&apos;s application of new historicist practices. [ Shakespeare and Renaissance studies ] &apos;&apos;Will in the World&apos;&apos; &quot; I believe that nothing comes of nothing, even in Shakespeare. I wanted to know where he got the matter he was working with and what he did with that matter &quot;. [ Greenblatt Stephen Hamlet in Purgatory 2002 Princeton University Press Princeton 978-0-691-10257-3 4 ] Greenblatt states in &quot; King Lear and Harsnett&apos;s &apos;Double-Fiction&apos; &quot; that &quot; Shakespeare&apos;s self-consciousness is in significant ways bound up with the institutions and the symbology of power it anatomizes &quot;. [ David Richter The Critical Tradition: Classic Texts and Contemporary Trends 1988 Bedford Books Boston 0-312-10106-6 1295 ] His work on Shakespeare has addressed such topics as ghosts, purgatory, anxiety, exorcists and revenge. He is also a general editor of the Norton Shakespeare. Greenblatt&apos;s new historicism opposes the ways in which new criticism “[consigns] texts to an autonomous aesthetic realm that [dissociates] Renaissance writing from other forms of cultural production” and the historicist notion that Renaissance texts “[mirror]… a coherent world-view that was held by a whole population,” asserting instead “that critics who [wish] to understand sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writing must delineate the ways the texts they [study] were linked to the network of institutions, practices, and beliefs that constituted Renaissance culture in its entirety”. Greenblatt’s work in Renaissance studies includes Renaissance Self-Fashioning (1980), which “had a transformative impact on Renaissance studies”. [ Norton Anthology of English Literature ] Greenblatt joined M. H. Abrams as general editor of the Norton Anthology of English Literature published by W.W. Norton during the 1990s. { Donadio, Rachel, The New York Times, January 8, 2006, &quot; Keeper of the Canon, &quot; } He is also the co-editor of the anthology&apos;s section on Renaissance literature. [ http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/02.02/05-anth.html Greenblatt Edits &apos;Norton Anthology&apos; Ken Gewertz 2 February 2006 Harvard University Gazette 2 March 2012 ] and the general editor of the Norton Shakespeare, “currently his most influential piece of public pedagogy &quot;. [ Literary interests, influences and personal favourites ] Greenblatt’s scholarly interests are listed as “Shakespeare; Early Modern Literature and Culture; Literature of Travel and Exploration; Religion and Literature; Literature and Anthropology; [and] Literary and Cultural Theory” on his faculty profile. His critical work is deeply indebted to &quot; Foucauldian and Marxist theories of history &quot;. [ Julie Rivkin Michael Ryan Literary Theory: An Anthology 2004 Blackwell Malden 1-4051-0696-4 506 ] In one interview, Greenblatt stated that the book which most influenced his life and career as a writer was Friedrich Nietzsche&apos;s On the Genealogy of Morals. Though he hated the book, it made him aware that some books have the power to challenge one’s beliefs.

Some of his favourite films are M, The Third Man and Shakespeare in Love (Greenblatt, Interview). He enjoys classical music, including Verdi&apos;s opera Don Carlo and Mozart&apos;s opera Così fan tutte, but does not listen to music while writing. &quot; At a certain point I passed from the naïve to what Schiller calls the sentimental—that is, I stopped reading books of marvels and began reading ethnographies and novels—but my childhood interests have survived in a passionate curiosity about other cultures and a fascination with tales &quot;. [ Greenblatt Stephen Marvelous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World 1992 University of Chicago Press Chicago 978-0-226-30652-0 2 ] &quot; My students... have had a profound influence upon everything I have written. And at the center of my intellectual life at Berkeley is the group of colleagues who have... shared ideas, argued, criticized, and given of themselves with remarkable generosity &quot;.

No one had heard of him. But when he and I arrived at the lecture room we were greeted by a grumpy porter who complained that the event was a fire hazard. The audience was hanging from the rafters. That was Stephen Greenblatt. The faculty hadn&apos;t heard of him, but the students were in there. &quot; [ See also ] New Historicism Cultural Materialism (often contrasted with) Discourse Episteme Marxism Historicism Literary theory [ Bibliography ] [ http://litguide.press.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/view.cgi?eid%3D194%26amp%3Bquery%3Dgreenblatt#top New Historicism Cadzow Hunter Conway Alison Traister Bryce 2005 Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism 2 March 2012 ] [ http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/1155 A conversation with author Stephen Greenblatt December 1, 2004 Charlie Rose PBS 2 March 2012 ] [ http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/02.02/05-anth.html Greenblatt Edits &apos;Norton Anthology&apos; Gewertz Ken 2 February 2006 Harvard University Gazette 2 March 2012 ] [ http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2000/09.21/greenblatt.html Greenblatt Named University Professor of the Humanities 21 September 2000 Harvard University Gazette ] [ Greenblatt Stephen The Greenblatt Reader 2005 Wiley-Blackwell Hoboken 978-1-4051-1566-7 ] [ Greenblatt Stephen Hamlet in Purgatory 2002 Princeton University Press Princeton 978-0-691-10257-3 ] [ Greenblatt Stephen Marvelous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World 1992 University of Chicago Press Chicago 978-0-226-30652-0 ] [ Greenblatt Stephen Shakespearean Negotiations: The Circulation of Social Energy in Renaissance England 1989 University of California Press Berkeley 978-0-520-06160-6 ] [ http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/183799-1/Stephen%2BGreenblatt.aspx Interview: Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare November 14, 2004 Booknotes C-SPAN 2 March 2012 ] [ Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism Vincent Leitch 2001 W.
