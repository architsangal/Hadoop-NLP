[ November 2010 ] Middle Eastern, Central Asian, South Asian, and Sikh turban wearers usually wind it anew for each wearing, using long strips of cloth. The cloth is usually not longer than five meters. Some elaborate South Asian turbans may be permanently formed and sewn to a foundation. Turbans can be very large or quite modest depending upon region, culture, and religion. Traditionally, &quot; turban &quot; has been the name of a type of headwear worn by women in Western countries. The wear of such turbans by women in Western societies is less common than it was earlier in the 20th century. They are usually sewn to a foundation, so that they can be donned or removed easily. Women in many parts of Africa and the West Indies often cover their heads with intricately tied scarves which may be called scarves, head wraps, or turbans.

[ Afghan turbans ] { Kandahar Province, } { Afghanistan. } Turbans are part of the national dress in Afghanistan, they are used more widely than elsewhere in the Muslim world, and are worn in a wide range of styles and colors. The turbans worn by the Taliban are either black (for descendants of Muhammad) or white, and have particularly long tails, while most other Afghans prefer shades of gray, green and brown. In the country&apos;s southeast, turbans are wrapped loosely and largely, whereas in Kabul turbans tend to be smaller and tighter. In traditional Afghan society, Turbans also serve practical purposes such as for wrapping oneself against the cold, to sit on, to tie up an animal or to carry water in the cap. [ Rubin Alyssa J.

[ Indian turbans ] [ Pagri (turban) Pagri ] { Hugo Salmson, Sweden } In India the turban is referred to as a pagri, meaning the headdress that is worn by men and is manually tied. There are several styles, specific to the wearer&apos;s region or religion, and they vary in shape, size and colour. The pagri is a symbol of honour and respect everywhere it is worn; it is a common practice to honour important guests by offering them one to wear. Colours are often chosen to suit the occasion or circumstance: for example saffron, associated with valour, is worn during rallies; white, associated with peace, is worn by elders; and pink, associated with spring, is worn during that season or for marriage ceremonies. During the British period the Muslim elites of South Asia, especially in western Punjab, used to wear a long pagri which was also a symbol of nobility, honour and respect. In the Muslim majority regions of Punjab and Sindh members of the land aristocracy always wore elaborate turbans known as the pagri. It was a part of the full formal dress that included the sherwani.

Examples include ( [ عمامة ] ) in Arabic, ( [ دستار ] ) in Persian. In Shi&apos;a Islam, a black head wrap around a small white cap is worn by descendants of Muhammad, and black turbans by well-educated persons and scholars. Black or white turbans are worn by the Taliban symbolizing they are descendants of Muhammad [ October 2011 ], although there is no evidence that any members of the Taliban are actually descended from Muhammad.

[ January 2012 ] [ Sikh turbans ] Sikh wearing a Dumalla The Sikh turban, known as the Dastar or a Dumalla, is mandatory for all Khalsa Sikhs to wear. (In the West, many Sikhs who wear pagri are sometimes mistaken for Muslims or Arabs. { Hoang, Lien. &quot; Mistaken for Muslims, Sikhs hit by hate crimes &quot; &quot; msnbc.com &quot;, May 8, 2011 } ). The Rajastan i turban is also commonly called the pagari. The Sikhs have a long history of being warriors and refer to themselves as saint-soldiers since their rise in the 1600-1700s. Their turban style and attire gives the identity of a warrior religion. All Sikh Gurus since Guru Nanak Dev Ji have worn turbans. However, covering one&apos;s hair with a turban was made an official policy by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of the Sikhs. The main reasons to wear turban are to take care of the hair, promote equality, and preserve the Sikh identity. Sikh women may wear a turban if they wish. Sikhs do not cut their hair, as a religious observance. The turban protects the hair and keeps it clean. As Sikhs only form 2% of India’s population, their turbans help identify them. When he institutionalized the turban as a part of the Sikh identity, Guru Gobind Singh said, &quot; My Sikh will be recognized among millions. &quot; The Dumalla (full name Chand Tora Dumalla) is the style of turban generally worn by Sikhs in battle. The &quot; Chand Tora &quot; is a metal symbol consisting of a crescent sword and a double edged sword, held in place at the front of the turban by a woven chainmail cord tied in a pattern within the turban to protect the head from slashing weapons. The Chand actually is a symbol of Shiva, who is always shown with a crescent in his hair. Shiva is considered a very powerful mythological figure. The purpose of the Tora is to keep the dastaar together. It goes over the bunga to protect it and protect the dasam dwar. Also used for keeping shastars together. In the past every Sikh man wore this type of turban, known as a Dumalla; it is still often worn in the Punjab. Turbans were formerly [ April 2012 ] associated with the upper class, and many men in the cultural elite still wear turbans. This distinction between the turban-wearing upper class (Sardars) and commoners promoted segregation and elitism. In order to eliminate the class system associated with turbans, Guru Gobind Singh Ji declared each and every Sikh a Sardar. He also rejected the class system by giving all Sikhs the last names Singh and Kaur. The most common turban colors worn by Sikh men are blue, orange, white and black. Sikh men decorate their turbans or Dumalla by wearing small weapons known as Shastars in them. [ Rastafari turbans ] Members of the Bobo Shanti mansion of the Rastafari movement keep their hair and beards, mainly keeping their hair in dreadlocks, they have been wearing turbans over their dreadlocks protecting and keeping their dreadlocks clean, along with wearing robes since their founding in the 1950s, { ROOTS RASTA RUNWAY } being a small population it makes them more distinctive in appearance in Jamaica and elsewhere. { Bobo Shanti (Bobo Shanti Congress or Ethiopia Black International Congress) } [ Western countries ] { Camila Batmanghelidjh wearing a turban and matching robe } { Piedad Cordoba Colombian Politician } Turbans have been worn by men and women since the 17th century, without ever becoming very common.

Some women wear them to make a statement of individuality, such as the British social entrepreneur Camila Batmanghelidjh, who usually wears a colourful matching turban and robe. Ethiopian Orthodox Christians usually wear short white turbans made of thin cotton, as do the Ethiopian Muslims [ April 2010 ].
