This concept album of P Funk mythology is usually rated as one of Parliament&apos;s best. Mothership Connection was the first P-funk album to feature Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley, who had left The J.B.&apos;s, James Brown &apos;s backing band. &quot; Mothership Connection &quot; became Parliament&apos;s first album to be certified gold and later platinum. [ United States Parliament album ] The Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry in 2011, declaring &quot; [t]he album has had an enormous influence on jazz, rock and dance music. &quot; { http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2011reg.html } [ Themes ] The Mothership Connection also reappropriates the image of the slave ship, transforming it into a spaceship. { Corbett, John. &quot; Brothers From Another Planet. &quot; Extended Play: Sounding Off from John Cage to Dr. Funkenstein. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1994. } The Mothership Connection draws on the imagery linking Black people and space travel pioneered by Sun Ra and that is important for Afrofuturism. [ History ] Describing the album, George Clinton said &quot; We had put black people in situations nobody ever thought they would be in, like the White House. I figured another place you wouldn&apos;t think black people would be was in outer space. I was a big fan of Star Trek, so we did a thing with a pimp sitting in a spaceship shaped like a Cadillac, and we did all these James Brown-type grooves, but with street talk and ghetto slang. &quot; { Cleveland - Music - Turn This Mutha Out } Dr. Dre prominently sampled the songs &quot; Mothership Connection (Star Child) &quot; and &quot; P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up) &quot; on his album The Chronic.
