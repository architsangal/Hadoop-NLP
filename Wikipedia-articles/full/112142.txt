[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 0446483 } [ 3 ] { http://www.zionsville-in.gov/ } Zionsville is an affluent town located in the extreme southeast area of Boone County, Indiana, in Eagle Township. The population was 14,160 at the 2010 census. Nearby communities include Brownsburg, Carmel, Whitestown, Westfield and Indianapolis. Zionsville promotes itself as a tourist attraction around its village-styled downtown area. This area primarily consists of Main Street, paved entirely in brick, which is lined with small stores and restaurants. [ History ] The historical marker near the corner of Main and Cedar streets. The current town of Zionsville began as a promotion by railway speculator William Zion, who partnered with Boone County landowner Elijah Cross to build a railway station on Cross&apos;s land in Eagle Township. The town was chartered in 1852, and the first resident was John Miller, who built and lived in a boarding house. By the 1860 census, the population was counted at 364. In this period, local businesses and houses of worship, specifically the local Methodist and Church of Christ congregations, relocated from nearby Eagle Village, which had also been platted on land originally owned by Cross. According to the local Chamber of Commerce Abraham Lincoln made a whistle-stop speech in Zionsville in 1861 when traveling to his inauguration. For much of the rest of its history, Zionsville has led a quiet existence, relying primarily upon its existence as a stop on passenger rail lines and later as a shopping destination or bedroom community. While white flight and other demographic changes in nearby Indianapolis greatly enlarged the city of Carmel and the town of Fishers in Hamilton County, especially since the imposition of Unigov in 1970, Zionsville had remained a much smaller locale until growth began to pick up into the mid to late 1990s. [ Consolidation ] As of January 2, 2010, Zionsville grew to around [ 50 sqmi km2 ] when its government consolidated with Eagle Township and Union Township of Boone County. Voters in the three areas passed a referendum Nov. 4, 2008 to institute the Plan of Government Reorganization. The town shares the Zionsville Community Schools district with the townships. In May 2007, the legislative bodies of the three areas authorized a nine-member committee to craft a government plan in accordance with the Government Modernization Act (Ind. Code 36-1.5), which was enacted by the Indiana General Assembly in 2006. The entities sought a new government in southeastern Boone County for two reasons: 1) to lock in a border around Zionsville and the townships to prevent annexation from outside communities; 2) to gain control over land development planning and zoning from the Boone County Plan Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals. The plan will affect the structure of the Zionsville Plan Commission, Zionsville Board of Zoning Appeals and the Zionsville Town Council. The town council, specifically, will increase from five members to seven members. Although the entire [ 50 sqmi km2 on ] area will become incorporated Zionsville, residents will fall under two distinct taxation/service districts — urban and rural. The urban district (the current Town of Zionsville) will maintain its Zionsville Police Department protection, as well as other municipal services like road maintenance. The rural district (the current Eagle and Union township residents in unincorporated Zionsville) will continue to receive police protection from the Boone County Sheriff&apos;s Department, and will maintain all current services. Every two years, a panel will determine whether a property in the rural district shall be absorbed into the urban district. The Eagle Township Advisory Board and Union Township Advisory Board will dissolve when the plan or reorganization goes into effect, and the Zionsville Town Council will take over the services they provide — like cemetery upkeep and resident assistance.
