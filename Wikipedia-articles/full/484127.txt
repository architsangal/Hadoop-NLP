The album wasn&apos;t released in the United States.

Room Service is an exciting, immediate, high-gloss pop gem that contains very little filler indeed. &quot;. Chili Paddy from MTV Asia also praised the album, &quot; There are many potential hit singles here such as the glorious chirpy sing-along &apos;Real Sugar&apos; &quot;. Carol Sullivan from UK newspaper The Guardian disliked the album, and wrote, &quot; Fredriksson&apos;s vocals are compelling yet curiously unengaged as she tries to negotiate Per Gessle&apos;s lyrics. &quot; Per Bjurman, from Swedish newspaper, Aftonbladet, bluntly put &quot; It (the album) is not very good. &quot;, and thought the album was not original, &quot; Many songs sound like covers of old Roxette material. Perhaps inevitable when you return to &apos;roots&apos;, but a little more imagination may be required. &quot; He did praise the three singles, &quot; Real Sugar &quot;, &quot; The Centre of the Heart &quot; and &quot; Milk and Toast and Honey &quot;, which he called &quot; Roxette&apos;s strongest ballad since &apos;It Must Have Been Love&apos; and &apos;Listen to Your Heart&apos; &quot;, but ended the review with &quot; Roxette is not finished. But soon, I suspect. &quot; The verse from &quot; Jefferson &quot; : &quot; Jefferson was always out of luck/I remember when we both grew up/ Jefferson got hit by a westbound truck/I guess that didn&apos;t make him look like a million bucks. &quot;, also brought a mixed response. Simon P. Ward from Yahoo! Music called the verse a &quot; lyrical gem &quot;, while Carol Sullivan from The Guardian put &quot; one of the worst first verses in history. &quot; Ward additionally noted that &quot; You Make My Head Go Pop &quot;, &quot;...has everything and the kitchen sink thrown into it - keyboards, techno beats, the guitar riff from the Stones &apos; &apos; Satisfaction &apos; and strings. &quot; In more recent years, Anders Nunstedt from Expressen gave more critical overviews to the album. In one article while talking about all of Roxette&apos;s studio albums, he said it was, &quot; Outdated, unattractive and also relatively unmusical. &quot; [ http://www.expressen.se/noje/1.2313664/nunstedt-om-roxettes-studioalbum Nunstedt om Roxettes studioalbum 2011-02-01 Anders Nunstedt Expressen 2012-01-14 ] While in another comment he stated &quot; On Have a Nice Day, you heard a band that has lost it&apos;s compass. You do not have to listen carefully to Room Service to hear the sound of a duo who have been lost in the woods so long that the search ended.

[ January 2009 ] [ European tour ] The Room Service World Tour 2001 was Roxette&apos;s first tour in over six years, and saw the duo perform live in many parts of Europe except the UK.
