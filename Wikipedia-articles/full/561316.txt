[ Biography ] [ Origins ] Krestinsky was born in the town of Mogilev, { Roginsky, A.B. (Ed.). &quot; 1938. March &quot;. 1998. The Communarka Memorial.

According to Russian archivist A. B. Roginsky, Krestinsky was of ethnic Russian origin. { Roginsky, A.B. (Ed.). &quot; 1938. March &quot;. 1998. The Communarka Memorial.

(Russian) http://www.memo.ru/memory/communarka/Chapter5.htm } Other sources suggest ethnic Ukrainian origins, while according to Felix Chuev, Vyacheslav Molotov maintained that Krestinsky&apos;s family had converted from Judaism to Eastern Orthodoxy. { Chuev, Felix (ed), Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics, 1993, Dee Ivan Inc } [ Rise to the top ] Krestinsky joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1903 and sided with its Bolshevik faction. After the February Revolution, which overthrew monarchy in Russia, he proved to be a capable organizer and was elected to the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party on August 3, 1917 ( Old Style ). He was made a member of the first Soviet Orgburo on January 16, 1919 and the first Politburo on March 25, 1919. He was also made a member of the Central Committee Secretariat on November 29, 1919 and served as the party&apos;s Responsible Secretary for the next 1.5 years. [ Fall from power ] In late 1920-early 1921, after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War, Krestinsky supported Leon Trotsky &apos;s faction in an increasingly bitter dispute over the direction of the country. After Vladimir Lenin &apos;s victory at the X Party Congress in March 1921, Krestinsky lost his Politburo, Orgburo and Secretariat posts and became Soviet ambassador to Germany. The post was an important and sensitive one because of Soviet Russia&apos;s crucial and delicate relationship with Germany at the time, but not nearly as important as his previous posts. Krestinsky supported Trotsky and the Left Opposition in 1923-early 1927, but distanced himself from Trotsky later in 1927. He completely broke with the opposition { Gus Fagan Biographical Introduction to Christian Rakovsky, 1980 } in April 1928. [ The show trial ] Krestinsky continued working as a diplomat until 1937 when he was arrested during the Great Purges. He was put on trial (as part of the Trial of the Twenty One ) on March 12, 1938. While almost all other defendants admitted their guilt during the Moscow Show Trials, Krestinsky at first denied everything, but reversed himself the following day: On March  12, he said to the presiding judge, Vasili Ulrikh : I do not recognize that I am guilty. I am not a Trotskyite. I was never a member of the &quot; right-winger and Trotskyite bloc &quot;, which I did not know to exist. Nor have I committed a single one of the crimes imputed to me, personally; and in particular I am not guilty of having maintained relations with the German Secret Service. The following day, he made a total reversal on his position: Yesterday, under the influence of a momentary keen feeling of false shame,evoked by the atmosphere of the dock and the painful impression created bythe public reading of the indictment, which was aggravated by my poor health,I could not bring myself to tell the truth, I could not bring myself to say that Iwas guilty. And instead of saying, &quot; Yes, I am guilty, &quot; I almost mechanically answered, &quot; No, I am not guilty. &quot; Such a reversion was a rare episode in the show trials of the late 1930s. Krestinsky was sentenced to death and executed in March 1938 [ July 2010 ]. He was partially exonerated during Nikita Khrushchev &apos;s partial destalinization and was cleared of all charges during perestroika [ July 2010 ].
