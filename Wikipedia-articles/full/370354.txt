It is a seaside resort that attracted many tourists in the summer months between the 1950s and 1970s, but which like many other British sea-side resorts went into decline as a holiday destination since holidays abroad became more affordable. These days it is more popular as a retirement location. [ Geography ] It is located between Jaywick and Holland-on-sea along the coastline and Great Clacton to the north. The relevant local authority is Tendring District Council. It is situated at the eastern end of the A133, accessed via a largely improved road from the A120 junction at Hare Green, four miles east of Colchester. Nearby to the north-east is the neighbouring resort of Frinton-on-Sea. [ Amenities ] Clacton has a pleasure pier, arcades, a golf course, caravan parks and an airfield.

[ History ] Clacton was the site of the lower Palaeolithic Clactonian industry of flint tool manufacture [ July 2009 ]. Great Clacton was founded by the Celts in c.100BC [ July 2009 ]. There are some vague traces of Romans using the Clacton area as a seaside resort. The name Clacton dates from c.500 AD when the area was settled by Saxons. The original name, Claccingaton, means &apos;the village of Clacc&apos;s people&apos;. The Domesday Book records the village as Clachintuna.

Henry VIII handed over the land to Thomas Cromwell 1539–1545 Henry VIII appointed himself Lord of Manors of Great and Little Clacton and Cann Hall after execution of Thomas Cromwell. 1645–1832 Smugglers Headquarters in Great Clacton, many tunnels are said to exist between St John&apos;s church and the Ship Inn as well as other places. One runs from the north side of the church towards St. John&apos;s square. Others are reputed to run from the Ship&apos;s Inn, Geddy Hall (Home of the Webb family), the Queen&apos;s head and at Eaglehurst, a house in Valley Road. The smugglers were a rough lot, sometimes taking captive the revenue men while they completed their work of loading cargo from the unguarded beach at Clacton and storing it, ready for &quot; Gentlemen &quot; to transport it to London. Clacton Beach was also situated between two noxious marshes: Little Holland to the east and Jaywick to the west. 7 December 1830 Luddites smashed up farm machinery on nearby farms. Sophia Crosskey, a local publican, calmed down the riot with promises of free drink and food. 1911 Archaeologist, J. Hazzledine Warren discovered a wooden spear, dating back at least 400,000 years. This is the oldest known man-made wooden artifact found on the British Isles&apos;. [ Seaside resort ] The modern day Clacton-on-Sea was founded by Peter Bruff in 1871 as a seaside resort. Originally the main means of access was by sea; Steamships operated by the Woolwich Steam Packet Company docked from 1871 at Clacton Pier which opened the same year. The pier now offers an amusement arcade and many other forms of entertainment. People who wanted to come by road had to go through Great Clacton. In the 1920s, London Road was built to cope with the influx of holidaymakers. Later, in the 1970s, the eastern section of the A120 was opened obviating the need for Clacton visitors to go through Colchester. [ Former Butlins ] [ Clacton (holiday camp) ] In 1936, Billy Butlin bought and refurbished the West Clacton Estate, an amusement park to the west of the town. He opened a new amusement park on the site in 1937 and then, a year later on 11 June 1938, he opened the second of his holiday camps. This camp was open until 1983 when due to package holiday s and changing tastes Butlins decided to close the camp. It was bought by former managers at the camp who reopened it as a short-lived theme park called Atlas Park. The land was then sold and redeveloped with housing.

A steam powered mill was built in 1867 to replace the windmill, which was eventually demolished in 1918. Nowadays, the town&apos;s main industrial area is in the northeast of the town (Gorse Lane Industrial Estate and Oakwood Business Park) which contain a variety of businesses and industrial units. [ Landmarks ] [ St John&apos;s Church ] St John&apos;s Church is the oldest surviving building in Clacton.
