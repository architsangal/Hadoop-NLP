The population was 9,263 at the 2010 census. { Colorado Trend Report 2: State and Complete Places (Sub-state 2010 Census Data). Missouri Census Data Center. Accessed 2011-02-25. } Gunbarrel is a developed (built-up) area of Boulder County, but it is not an incorporated town or village. Gunbarrel locations may have postal addresses indicating Boulder, Niwot, or Longmont as the city. The term Gunbarrel is also used colloquially to refer to a larger area, which includes parts of the city of Boulder and rural portions of Boulder County in addition to the CDP. However, this article is about the CDP specifically. [ Geography ] Gunbarrel is located at [ 40 3 56 N 105 11 15 W type:city ] (40.065482, -105.187523) [ 1 ]. It is northeast of the city of Boulder proper, separated by a buffer area of private agricultural lands and publicly owned open space. The buffer areas provide over two miles (3  km) of separation over changing elevations. { Boulder County Open Space Maps, accessed 30 May 2007 } This reduces the impact of the Boulder Municipal Airport and the Boulder County Sheriff&apos;s Department facilities (including the county jail), which are located on the southern side of the buffer. Two reservoirs operated by the Boulder and Left Hand Irrigation Company { Twin Lakes Open Space information page, Boulder County Parks and Open Space Department, accessed 30 May 2007 } are located in central Gunbarrel. Irrigation ditches and canals, including the Boulder and Whiterock Ditch, pass though this primarily residential area. The Twin Lakes Open Space, a large park which includes the two reservoirs and extends west along the ditch, is operated by the Boulder County Parks and Open Space Department. The park brings protected wetlands, jogging trails and green spaces directly into the urban area. The City of Boulder operates Eaton Park, adjacent to the west lake. Eaton Park includes picnic facilities, BMX jumps and additional protected wetland. Flood control facilities are integral to the reservoir and canal systems, but they do not eliminate the flood risk to adjacent development. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of [ 6.4 sqmi km2 ], of which, [ 6.4 sqmi km2 ] of it is land and [ 0.04 sqmi km2 ] of it (0.47%) is water.

[ Government ] The Gunbarrel Public Improvement District (GPID), formerly the Gunbarrel General Improvement District, was formed by residents of Gunbarrel in 1993. At the time, county residents were concerned about the negative effects of development in the adjacent neighborhoods of the city of Boulder. { GPID History and Current Status, Gunbarrel Community Association website, accessed 19 June 2007 } They felt they needed to counterbalance the city&apos;s annexation and development powers and better manage the traffic city development was creating. The GPID is administered by the Boulder County commissioners. The GPID is a &apos;special district&apos; under Colorado law, with the ability to levy taxes and incur debt. GPID uses this money to purchase open space and improve roads in the unincorporated subdivisions, consistent with their primary mission of maintaining quality of life and property values in unincorporated Gunbarrel. GPID open space lands are managed by Boulder County Parks and Open Space. A map of GPID lands can be found at the Gunbarrel Community Association website. This map also depicts the boundaries of the District&apos;s taxation area. [ Transportation ] The 205 bus of the RTD bus system gives service throughout Gunbarrel and into Boulder.
