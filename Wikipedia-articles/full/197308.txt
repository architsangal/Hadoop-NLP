It acts as a local station on the North Kent Line between London and Gillingham, served by Southeastern, and is the southern terminus of the Woolwich Arsenal branch of the Docklands Light Railway. The station faces General Gordon Square and is named after the nearby Woolwich Arsenal. It is the only DLR station to be located in Travelcard Zone 4. [ History ] The station opened in 1849, serving the North Kent Line from London to Gillingham. The station building was rebuilt in 1906 with a London brick -built structure, very typical of southeast London. The current station building dates from 1996, and has a modern design in steel and glass. It has a circular theme, quite different from what existed before. Woolwich Arsenal was expanded in 2009, when Transport for London completed the construction of an extension of the London City Airport branch of the Docklands Light Railway from King George V to Woolwich Arsenal, which is the branch&apos;s new terminus. The official opening took place on 12 January 2009. [ Design ] DLR train awaiting departure to Bank The National Rail part of the station consists of two above-ground platforms. The up platform for London has a refreshment facility. The down platform serves trains going east, towards north Kent, via Plumstead, Abbey Wood and Slade Green. The Docklands Light Railway part of the station is underground, and consists of two platforms in an island platform configuration. As Woolwich Arsenal is a terminus, both platforms serve an up line to Bank via London City Airport, Canning Town and Poplar. Trains depart in the eastbound direction due to the curve under the River Thames.
