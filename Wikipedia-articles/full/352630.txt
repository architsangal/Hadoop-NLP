[ 1926 10 23 y ] [ 2002 9 6 1926 10 23 y ] { Conservative } { Yale University } { St Anne&apos;s College, Oxford } Janet Mary Baker Young, Baroness Young PC (23 October 1926 – 6 September 2002), was a British Conservative politician. She served as the first ever female Leader of the House of Lords from 1981 to 1983, first as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and from 1982 as Lord Privy Seal. She was the only woman ever appointed to the Cabinet by Margaret Thatcher. Born Janet Mary Baker in 1926, she went to the mainly boys Dragon School in Oxford where she played rugby and cricket, and then to Headington School. During World War II she studied at Yale, and then took an MA in philosophy, politics and economics at St Anne&apos;s College, Oxford. She married Geoffrey Tyndale Young, and had three daughters. { Obituary, BBC 6 September 2002 } She became a councillor for Oxford City Council in 1957 and was leader by 1967. Not long after she was made a peer on the advice of Edward Heath, as Baroness Young, of Farnworth in the County Palatine of Lancaster. As the Lady Young she was appointed Leader of the House of Lords, and sat on the boards of large corporations such as NatWest and Marks and Spencer. In later life she was mainly known for her staunch opposition to gay rights. She worked to try to stop legislation going through that would allow unmarried couples (including gay men and women) to adopt children, and also led campaigns in the House of Lords to prevent equalisation of the age of consent for homosexual men with that of heterosexual s, and also fought the repeal of Section 28. She was ultimately defeated on all counts. Although she managed to delay the repeal of Section 28 in England and Wales in 2000, Section 28 was finally removed from the statute book in 2003. She died at the age of 75 following a long battle with cancer. Following her death, gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell declared that she had &quot; poisoned society with prejudice and intolerance &quot; and that &quot; future historians will rank her alongside the defenders of apartheid. She supported homophobic discrimination to the last. &quot; &apos;&apos; { &apos;&apos;The Independent&apos;&apos;, 7 September 2002 } Tim Montgomerie, then Chairman of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, said that &quot; Baroness Young led a life of great service to Christian causes. She defended marriage and the family against an onslaught of damaging legislation in recent years. Unlike many of today&apos;s politicians and churchleaders, she refused to accept that the breakdown of the family was inevitable and she invested every effort into standing up for the interests of vulnerable children. If only more Christians followed her example and sought political office, the country would, perhaps, not face the same difficulties that it does. She will be sadly missed. &quot; { Christian Institute tribute to Baroness Young } [ References ] [ The Lord Soames ] [ Leader of the House of Lords 1981–1983 ] [ The Viscount Whitelaw ] |- [ Francis Pym ] [ Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 1981–1982 ] [ Cecil Parkinson ] |- [ Humphrey Atkins ] [ Lord Privy Seal 1982–1983 ] [ John Biffen ] |- [ The Lord Soames ] [ Leader of the Conservative Party in the House of Lords 1981–1983 ] [ The Viscount Whitelaw ] [ Young, Janet British politician 23 October 1926 6 September 2002 ] Category:1926 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Cancer deaths in England Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Chancellors of the Duchy of Lancaster Category:Conservative Party (UK) life peers Category:Female life peers Category:Female members of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom Category:Leaders of the House of Lords Category:LGBT history in the United Kingdom Category:LGBT law in the United Kingdom Category:Lords Privy Seal Category:People educated at The Dragon School Category:Members of Oxford City Council Category:People educated at Headington School, Oxford de:Janet Young, Baroness Young pl:Janet Young
