{ Berlin Sportpalast. The sign says &quot; } [ de Totaler Krieg – Kürzester Krieg ] { &quot; (Total War – Shortest War). } The Sportpalast speech ( [ Sportpalastrede ], Sports-Palace speech) or total war speech was a speech delivered by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels at the Berlin Sportpalast to a large but carefully selected audience on 18 February 1943 calling for a total war, as the tide of World War II had turned against Nazi Germany and its Axis allies. It is considered the most famous of Joseph Goebbels&apos;s speeches. The speech was the first public admission by the Nazi leadership that Germany faced serious dangers. Goebbels exhorted the German people to continue the war even though it would be long and difficult because he asserted that both Germany&apos;s survival and the survival of a non-Bolshevist Europe were at stake. [ Background ] Compared to the previous year, 1943 started with Germany suffering major military problems on all fronts. On 2 February the Battle of Stalingrad ended with the surrender of Field Marshal Paulus and the German 6th Army to the Soviets. At the Casablanca Conference, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill demanded Germany&apos;s unconditional surrender, and the Soviets, spurred by their victory, were beginning to retake territory, including Kursk (8 February), Rostov (14 February), and Kharkiv (16 February). In North Africa, the Afrika Korps under Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was beginning to face setbacks, when German supply ships sailing to Tripoli were sunk by the Allies during January. The Western Desert Campaign had ended with British victory and the Axis were in Tunisia between two Allied forces—one advancing from Algeria and one from Libya. The fortunes of Germany&apos;s Axis allies were turning as well. Italy&apos;s military collapse had made the war in Africa a largely German operation, and in the Pacific, the Americans had just completed their months-long reconquest of Guadalcanal after the victories at Midway and the Coral Sea. Adolf Hitler responded with the first measures that would lead to the all-out mobilization of Germany. On 2 February, 100,000 restaurants and clubs were closed throughout the country so that the civilian population could contribute more to the war. Millions of Germans listened to Goebbels on the radio as he delivered this speech about the &quot; misfortune of the past weeks &quot; and an &quot; unvarnished picture of the situation. &quot; The audience reacted fanatically, causing an even bigger impact; they were selected by Goebbels to perform appropriately, showing one of his many skills as propaganda minister. Goebbels also wanted, by amassing such popular enthusiasm, to convince Hitler to give him greater powers in running the war economy. [ Details ] Goebbels cited three theses in the speech: { Michael Balfour, Propaganda in War 1939-1945: Organisation, Policies and Publics in Britain and Germany, p322 ISBN 0-7100-0193-2 } If the Wehrmacht was not in a position to break the danger from the Eastern front, then the German Reich would fall to Bolshevism, and all of Europe shortly afterwards; The Wehrmacht, the German people, and the Axis Powers alone had the strength to save Europe from this threat; Danger was at hand. Germany had to act quickly and decisively, or it would be too late. Goebbels concluded that &quot; Two thousand years of Western history are in danger, &quot; and blamed Germany&apos;s failures on the Jew s. While Goebbels referred to Soviet mobilization nationwide as &quot; devilish, &quot; he explained that &quot; We cannot overcome the Bolshevist danger unless we use equivalent, though not identical, methods [in a] total war. &quot; He then justified the austerity measures enacted, explaining them as temporary measures. Historically, the speech is important in that it marks the first admission by the Party leadership that they were facing problems, and launched the mobilization campaign that, arguably, prolonged the war, under the slogan: &quot; And storm, break loose! &quot; ( [ de Und Sturm, brich los! ] ).Goebbels claimed that no German was thinking of any compromise and instead that &quot; the entire nation is only thinking about a hard war &quot;. Goebbels attempted to counter reports in the Allied press that German civilians had lost faith in victory by asking the audience a number of questions at the end, such as: Do you believe with the Führer and us in the final total victory of the German people?Are you and the German people willing to work, if the Führer orders, 10, 12 and if necessary 14 hours a day and to give everything for victory?Do you want total war? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything that we can even imagine today? [ Setting and audience ] The setting of the speech in the Sportpalast placed the audience behind and under a big banner with the all-capitals German words &quot; TOTALER KRIEG — KÜRZESTER KRIEG &quot; (total war — briefest war) along with Nazi banners and Nazi swastika s. Although Goebbels claimed that the audience included people from &quot; all classes and occupations &quot; (including &quot; soldiers, doctors, scientists, artists, engineers and architects, teachers, white collars &quot; ) it was evident to outsiders that the propagandist had carefully selected his listeners. After the speech, Goebbels said to Albert Speer that it was the best-trained audience one could find in Germany. [ Quotes ] [ de Ich frage euch: Wollt ihr den totalen Krieg? Wollt ihr ihn, wenn nötig, totaler und radikaler, als wir ihn uns heute überhaupt erst vorstellen können? ] [ de Nun, Volk, steh auf und Sturm brich los! ] Original German English Translation &quot; I ask you: Do you want total war ? If necessary, do you want a war more total and radical than anything that we can even yet imagine? &quot; […] […] &quot; The last line originated in the poem Männer und Buben (Men and Boys) by Carl Theodor Körner during the Napoleonic Wars. Körner&apos;s words had been quoted by Adolf Hitler in his 1920 speech &quot; What We Want &quot; delivered at Munich&apos;s Hofbräuhaus, but also by Goebbels himself in older speeches, including his 6 July 1932 campaign speech before the Nazis took power in Germany. { calvin.edu German propaganda archive } [ References ] [ External links ] Complete Sportpalast speech: Complete Sportpalast speech English translation, in German Category:Nazi Germany Category:World War II speeches Category:1943 in Germany Category:Speeches Category:1943 in international relations da:Sportpalasttalen de:Sportpalastrede fr:Discours du Sportpalast id:Pidato Sportpalast ja:総力戦演説 ru:Речь о тотальной войне sr:Гебелсов говор у Спортпаласту fi:Urheilupalatsipuhe sv:Sportpalatstalet th:สุนทรพจน์สพอร์ทพาลัสท์ zh:體育宮講話
