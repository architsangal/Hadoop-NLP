[ December 2007 ] Winfield Scott Schley (9 October 1839 - 2 October 1911) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy and the hero of the Battle of Santiago Bay during the Spanish-American War.

On his return in 1861, the American Civil War was in progress. He was made master, and was assigned to the &apos;&apos;Potomac&apos;&apos; of the Western Gulf Squadron until 1862. He then served on the sidewheel gunboat &apos;&apos;Winona&apos;&apos; of that Squadron, and later on the sloop s &apos;&apos;Monongahela&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Richmond&apos;&apos;, and participated in all the engagements that led to the capture of Port Hudson, Louisiana, in 1863, having been promoted to lieutenant on 16 July 1862. [ Chincha Island War and San Salvador Revolution ] He was ordered from the waters of the South in 1864 to the Pacific Squadron, where he served on the &apos;&apos;Wateree&apos;&apos; as executive officer until 1866. He suppressed an insurrection of Chinese workers on the Chincha Islands in 1865, and later in the same year landed at La Union, San Salvador, to protect American interests during a revolution. He was promoted lieutenant-commander in 1866. [ Korean Expedition ] [ Korean Expedition ] From 1866 to 1869, he was an instructor in the United States Naval Academy. He was then assigned to the Asiatic Station, and served there on the screw sloop &apos;&apos;Benicia&apos;&apos; until 1872 and was adjutant of the land forces during the attack by Rear Admiral John Rodgers &apos;s expedition on the Korean forts on Ganghwa Island on 10 June and 11 June 1871. He then participated in the following Battle of Gangwha which caused the destruction of the Korean fortifications. [ Between conflicts, 1870s-1890s ] From 1872 to 1875, he was head of the department of modern languages in the Naval Academy. He was promoted commander in June 1874. After serving in Europe and on the west coast of Africa, he commanded &apos;&apos;Essex&apos;&apos; from 1876 to 1879, most of the time in the South Atlantic on the Brazil Station. During the cruise he sailed Essex to the vicinity of the South Shetland Islands in search of a missing sealer, and rescued a shipwrecked crew on the islands of Tristan da Cunha. From 1879 until October 1883, he was inspector of the Second Lighthouse District. After re-supply and relief missions repeatedly failed to reach Lieutenant Adolphus Greely &apos;s Lady Franklin Bay Expedition in the Arctic, Schley was appointed in February 1884 to command the next relief expedition. On 22 June, near Cape Sabine in Grinnell Land, Schley rescued Greely and six (of his twenty-four) companions, after passing through 1400 miles of ice during the voyage.

Scribner&apos;s Sons 424–430 670878 ] Schley was commissioned chief of the bureau of equipment and recruiting at the United States Department of the Navy in 1885, and promoted captain in March 1888. He commanded &apos;&apos;Baltimore&apos;&apos; (C-3) in Rear Admiral George Brown&apos;s squadron off the coast of Chile in 1891. Going to the port of Valparaiso, Chile, when a number of American sailors there were stoned by a mob. In August 1891, the Baltimore, still under his command was detailed to convey the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden. Early in 1892 he was again transferred to the Lighthouse Bureau, and until February 1895 was inspector of the Third Lighthouse District. In 1895, he was placed in command of the &apos;&apos;New York&apos;&apos;. From 1897 to 1898, he was a member (and chairman) of the Lighthouse Board. [ Spanish War ] Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley during the Spanish-American war Schley was commissioned commodore on 6 February 1898, and on 24 March, although lowest on the list of commodores, he was put in command of the Flying Squadron, with &apos;&apos;Brooklyn&apos;&apos; (CA-3) as his flagship, for service in the Spanish-American War. On 18 May 1898, Schley&apos;s Flying Squadron was sent by Acting Rear Admiral William T. Sampson to Cienfuegos to pursue the Spanish Squadron under the command of Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete. When Sampson received news that Cervera was in Santiago de Cuba, not Cienfuegos, he initially vacillated, at first informing Schley of the rumor, yet requesting him to stay at Cienfuegos, then later changing his orders to have Schley investigate the situation at Santiago. Although Schley was subordinate to Sampson, he was accustomed to exercising independent command of his ship. Schley decided to stay at Cienfuegos, feeling that all signs indicated that Cervera was there in the harbor. After hearing from Cuba n insurgents that Cervera was definitely not at Cienfuegos, Schley decided to obey Sampson&apos;s orders three days after receiving them and go to Santiago. When the crew of three American cruiser s he encountered denied knowledge of Cervera&apos;s whereabouts, Schley decided to return to Key West, Florida, to get coal for his ship. The Navy Department sent a dispatch to Schley asking him to stay at Santiago, but he replied that he was unable to obey these orders. Inexplicably, Schley decided mid-voyage to return to Santiago on 28 May, where the following day it was confirmed that the Spanish Squadron was there. Sampson arrived on 1 June and assumed command. The American ships formed a reverse crescent from West to South to East to blockade the narrow south facing harbor entrance channel to trap the Spanish ships. Generally, the crescent would be made up of the faster Brooklyn and Texas to the West and south and the heavier Oregon, Iowa, and Massachusetts to the South and East. The concept was that the bigger but slower warships would shield the Daiquiri beachhead and supply ships to supporting the land invasion to the East and the faster ships to the West would be able to converge on the Spanish fleet as it came out. Clearly the greatest concern to the Navy was protecting the Army beachhead from a Spanish sortie. Of less concern was the Spanish ships running to the West to escape. There was one other ship, the armored cruiser New York, as fast as the Brooklyn but less heavily armed, which Sampson used as his own personal flagship. On 3 July, while Sampson in New York was en route to meet General Shafter onshore and Massachusetts off coaling at Guantanamo, the wily and courageous Admiral Cervera attempted to force his squadron through the blockade coming out of the channel to Santiago harbor with guns blazing and then turning West. Schley had assumed control in Sampson&apos;s absence and Brooklyn was his flagship and placed on the extreme Western side of the American crescent. As part of his plan, Cervera intentionally steered the Maria Teresa, his flagship and lead ship of the Spanish Squadron and already significantly damaged as it passed by the Iowa which caught it with two 12 inch shells, directly at &quot; Brooklyn &quot; with the intent to ram and/or launch bow torpedoes (which had very short range). Cevera&apos;s intent was to sacrifice the Teresa to make a hole to the West for the rest of the Spanish ships, which had followed the Teresa out of the narrow channel in single file and through the gauntlet of Indiana and Iowa to the East and Texas and Oregon to the South,and take out Brooklyn, the fastest ship in the American fleet. The Brooklyn and Texas rushed forward initially at the Spanish (this was the general plan, to close with the enemy as quickly as possible, but as the Teresa turned west the Texas matched its direction to offer its broadside and run with the Spanish fleet, as did Oregon behind it. The firing was continuous from all ships, with the Americans somewhat blinded by the smoke, more so than the Spaniards. Schley, in Brooklyn, moving East, suddenly realizing that the Teresa was not going to veer off but was going to ram or launch torpedoes, ordered the Brooklyn to steer away from the surprisingly aggressive Maria Teresa back towards the path of the rest of the squadron. This action caused the &apos;&apos;Texas&apos;&apos;, which was just getting up to full speed, to suddenly reverse its engines for three minutes, bringing it to a near stop. The Texas stopped because it could no longer see the Brooklyn after it had noted the start of the latter&apos;s turn in its general direction. This action byTexas was precautionary but clearly prudent, as a collision would have been a disaster. It is not documented how close the Brooklyn crossed to the bow of the Texas. A newspaper artist later put it very close and Captain Philip stated later that the Brooklyn was quite large in appearance as it crossed in front of the Texas as the massive armored cruiser appeared out of the smoke. Subsequently, the now stationary Texas was also forced to cease firing, as the USS Oregon, now moving at a surprising speed for a pre-dreadnought battleship, ran up aft of the Texas and properly, due to its greater firepower, passed to the inside towards the Spanish fleet, effectively masking the fire of Texas for a few minutes. This was not particularly grave as the Texas, an obsolescent design, could not put out near the rate of firepower of the other battleships. When the Olympia passed, the Texas found itself engaged by the Oquendo, the fourth ship in the Spanish line, and received four hits, the Spaniard firing the last of its &quot; good &quot; ammunition (the Spanish vessels were handicapped because their otherwise rapid-firing 5.5 inch guns only had a limited supply of properly-made ammunition, which they expended very quickly). Ironically, because the Texas had already to some extent engaged the Teresa, the Vizcaya, and the Colon, and now the Oquendo more closely and even the trailing Spanish torpedo boats, and had been involved with the excitement of the maneuvers by Brooklyn and Oregon, it received excellent press, far more than it actually deserved, and this to some extent may have exacerbated the negative impression arising from it having to first stop to avoid potential collision and then having its fire masked. The Texas had also already earned laurels during the taking of the Guantanamo, and would gain more in its engagement with the Reina Mercedes after the battle, and this may have increased its perceived importance. There is no doubt that Schley&apos;s turn gave the Spanish ships added time to get out of the mouth of Santiago harbor, but the American fleet, including Schley&apos;s Brooklyn, which had completed its turn and was still ahead of the Oregon, closed and at only about 1,000 yards engaged the Vizcaya in a running fight. It was fortunate for Schley that the Vizcaya, ordinarily a fast ship, was very slow due to having an extremely fouled hull and could not match the speed of the Colon which was now clear of the fight. Had the hull of the Vizcaya been clean, Schley would have found himself chasing two ships and not fighting one. The Teresa was now on fire and was so damaged that it had to turn north and beach itself. The battle between the Brooklyn and the Vizcaya was ferocious for a time as the ships steamed west, but the quality weaponry of the Brooklyn overwhelmed it, not to mention the Oregon which was astern and firing. The Vizcaya, terribly damaged after a torpedo exploded internally and on fire, was forced to also beach itself. By this time the Oquendo and the Spanish destroyers had also been overwhelmed by American fire. Now Schley steamed after the Colon with Oregon trailing and the Texas following further behind, while the Iowa and Indiana and auxiliary vessels saw to the aftermath of the rest of the disabled Spanish fleet. The race with the Colon was dramatic, but the Colon eventually slowed as its small supply of English coal ran out and it had to rely on lower quality fuel; eventually it was forced to try to turn South and make a break. However, the long range 13 &quot; guns of the Oregon dissuaded it and with the Brooklyn immediately behind the Captain of the Colon decided to beach and scuttle his ship. The capture of the Colon was an exciting end to the battle. Captain Philip of the Texas, who expressed no present or later ill will at the temporary discomfiture of Texas during the battle due to the Brooklyn&apos;s turn, stated that when he was going to the Brooklyn in a small boat to report to Schley, the Commodore happily shouted down to him from the bridge, &quot; Some fight, eh, Jack? &quot; All the while, Sampson in the New York, too far to the East at his meeting, tried mightily to catch up to the battle. By the time the New York reached the bulk of the Spanish fleet the battle was over and New York also could not catch the beaching of the Colon. The New York had not been able to fire a single shot, depriving Sampson of any participation in the battle. When the victory message from Sampson, who was of course in overall command of the naval campaign, was reported, it contained no reference to any officer other than himself, even though he was not involved in the actual fighting. Sampson was loath to praise Schley&apos;s role in the battle, a fact which derived from professional jealousy, as was evidenced later by Sampson&apos;s own conduct at the subsequent court of inquiry. Sampson was of the opinion that had it not been for the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, Schley would have been court-martialed. The public, however, regarded Schley as the hero not only of the battle, but also of the war, while Sampson was seen (accurately) as indecorous for not acknowledging Schley&apos;s role. [ July 2010 ] In August 1898, Schley was raised to the rank of rear admiral. [ After Cuba ] On 14 April 1899, Schley was commissioned rear admiral, ranking as major general. In November 1899, he was put in command of the South Atlantic Squadron, and, on 9 October 1901, he retired from active service upon reaching the age limit. [ Controversy ] A controversy arose between partisans of Schley and those of Sampson over their respective claims to the credit of the victory over Cervera&apos;s fleet during the recent war. Of that discussion neither officer personally took public notice until after the appearance of a work by Edgar Stanton Maclay entitled History of the United States Navy. In that book, the author referred to Commodore Schley as a “caitiff, poltroon and coward.” The proofs of the book had been read and approved by various naval officers, among them Rear Admiral Sampson. At Schley&apos;s request, because of the charges made against him in the book, a court of inquiry was opened on September 12, 1901, composed of Admiral George Dewey, Rear Admiral Andrew E. K. Benham and Rear Admiral Francis Munroe Ramsay, which investigated Schley&apos;s conduct before and during the Battle of Santiago. On 13 December 1901, the court reported its proceedings and the testimony taken, with a full and detailed statement of all the pertinent facts which it deemed to be established, together with its opinion and recommendations. Various officers gave conflicting testimony as to Schley&apos;s conduct, with one, Captain Templin Potts, directly accusing Schley of cowardice. [ Conflicting Testimony in the Schley Court http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res%3DF30C16FC355D1A728DDDA90994D8415B818CF1D3 11 November 2010 The New York Times 10 October 1901 The New York Times Company New York City ] The majority report of the court found that Commodore Schley failed to proceed to Santiago with due despatch, that the squadron should not have been delayed by the Eagle, that he should not have turned westward, that he should have obeyed the Navy Department&apos;s order of May 25, 1898, that he did not do his utmost to capture the Colon, that the turn of the Brooklyn caused the Texas to stop, for carelessness in endangering Texas, for blanketing the fire of other American vessels (the Texas&apos;s fire was blanketed when stopped as the USS Olympia dashed past her), that he did injustice to lieutenant-commander Hodgson (Navigation officer of the Brooklyn at the time of the incident), that his conduct in the Santiago campaign was characterized by vacillation, dilatoriness, and &quot; lack of enterprise, &quot; and that his coal reports were inaccurate and misleading. Admiral Dewey, however, presented a minority report, in which he praised Schley for promptness and efficient service, and gave him the credit for the destruction of Cervera&apos;s fleet. The court recommended that no action be taken in view of the length of time which had elapsed. Rear Admiral Schley filed a protest against the court&apos;s findings, which, however, were approved by the Secretary of the Navy Long, who (expectedly) supported Sampson on grounds of rank and seniority. Nonetheless, the public press, and particularly the Hearst newspapers, saw the outcome as vindicating Schley, whose status as a war hero was enhanced by the exposure. { Record of proceedings of a court of inquiry in the case of Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley } In January 1902, Rear Admiral Schley appealed from the verdict to President Theodore Roosevelt, who, however, confirmed Secretary Long&apos;s approval. Schley wrote, with James Russell Soley, The Rescue of Greely (New York, 1885). He also wrote and published his autobiography, Forty-five Years under the Flag (New York, 1904).

B. Conkey, 1902). Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley died on October 2, 1911, nine years after Rear Admiral Sampson, who barely survived his retirement in 1902. Rear Admiral Schley was buried with all military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, where he also has a street named for him. There is a memorial to Schley in the lobby of the Maryland state house, [ http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/speccol/sc1500/sc1545/e_catalog_2002/keyserern.html The Annapolis Complex Collection Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley (1839-1909) 2007-12-16 ] and a bust of him by Ernest Keyser in Annapolis. { Proske, Beatrice Gilman, Brookgreen Gardens Sculpture, Brookgreen Gardens, South Carolina, 1968, p. 301 } [ Namesake ] [ November 2010 ] USS &apos;&apos;Schley&apos;&apos; (DD-103/APD-14) was named in his honor.
