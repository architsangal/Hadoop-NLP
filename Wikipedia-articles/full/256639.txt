The town of Galaţi is the capital of Galați County.Galaţi lies in the historical region of Moldavia, near to Brăila. Galați is the largest port and the largest sea port on the Danube River. It is the second largest port in Romania. { Port Galati Informations } { Inland Romanian Ports } In 2011, census data recorded 231204 inhabitants in the city of Galaţi. At that time it was the seventh most populous city in Romania. Galaţi is an industrial city based around the Naval Shipyard, the Arcelor-Mittal steel plant and the Port. [ Etymology and names ] The name &quot; Galaţi &quot; is derived from the Cuman word galat. This word is borrowed from the Arabic word qal&apos;at, meaning a fortress. Other etymologies have been proposed, such as the Serbian galac. However, the galat root appears in nearby toponyms, some of which show clearly a Cuman origin, for example Gălățui Lake, which has the typical Cuman -ui suffix for &quot; water &quot;. Another toponym in the region is the Galicia, with its town of Halych, locally associated with the jackdaw (Kawka, Halka). Other similar place names are Galich, Russia and Galatia in Turkey. Gaul might be a derivation from Galatia, thus suggesting a Celtic origin. A similar pattern occurs with the celtic sounding word, Ligures referring to &quot; Caladaa &quot; being a city of the Ligurian or Genoan territories. Although possible, a celtic origin is, however, unlikely. Names in other languages: [ Γκαλάτσι ] [ Galatz ] [ Galac ] [ Gałacz ] [ Kalas ] [ Галац ] [ Галац ] [ Галац ] (Galatsi) (Galats) (Galats) (Galats) [ History ] Galați, 1826 Domnească Street, 1905 [ Ancient origins ] Archeological evidence points to occupation of the region in the neolithic period. For example, north west of the town of Galați, on the eastern shores of the Malina marshes, fragments of ceramic-type Stoicani Aldeni, stilex and tools made of bone were found. A stone sceptre, from the late bronze age, belonging to the Coslogeni culture was found on the marshes&apos; southern bank.Galați town itself developed from an ancient Dacia n settlement of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE where there was a ford across the Danube river.In 101 to 102 and 105 to 106, the Dacians fought wars against the Romans. The area became part of the Roman empire. From the 300s a Daco-Roman settlement developed at the ford, south of the site of the Church of the Virgin. [ Medieval period ] There is evidence of continuous inhabitation of Galați since the 600s. A treasure hoard consisting of 12 silver coins issued between 613 and 685 was found in a Byzantine tomb near the Church of the Virgin. Western and Byzantine coins from the time of Emperor Michael IV (1034–1041) were also found. At one time, the city became part of the Republic of Genoa Territories and was called &quot; Caladda &quot; { http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Repubblica_di_Genova.png [map of Repubblica di Genova] }.In 1445, a document signed by Stephen II of Moldavia mentions Galați.In July and August 1484, Chilia and Kishinev were conquered by Turkey. Galați township remained an important port not only for domestic trade but for trade with Turkey and Poland as well. [ Modern times ] In 1789, during the Russo-Turkish war of 1789-1791, Galați was burned by the armies of the Russian general Mikhail Kamensky. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, various wars raged across this part of Europe. Despite this, Galați was of such importance for trade that in 1775, Russia created the first local consulate. French and English vice-consuls followed in 1805. In 1850, James Buchanan, the U.S. president, sent a vice-consul to Galați and opened a consulate in 1858. Austrian steamships were making scheduled arrivals in Galați after 1834. Galați was also a trading port for German lands. The port became a site for the construction of large warships. Abbot Boskov, a Romanian traveller stated: &quot; I saw a large boat, the way those who say Turks caravels, which is on site, ready to be launched into the water. He was commissioned by Isaac-aga, big tax collector of Constantinople. The ship was huge, seventeen seventy steps, and loaded with eighty-four bronze cannons. &quot; [ Burial of Hetman Mazeppa ] The Ukranian folk hero, Ivan Stepanovich Mazeppa was born in 1644 in Podolia Palatinate. He became a Hetman in 1687. He died on October 2, 1709 in Varna, then in Bessarabia, Turkey and was buried in Galați. This came about because Mazeppa&apos;s family had obtained a firman or decree for Mazeppa&apos;s body to be taken to Jerusalem. However, when his body reached Galați, Mazeppa was buried at the St George church. This was because, the St George church, built by a local merchant from old Roman masonry, was dedicated to the Church of the holy sepulchre in Jerusalem. The St George church is inscribed &quot; Hagi Mihalachi osârdia during his Istrati Dabija voivode, in 7172 &quot; therefore dating to 1 April, 1664. { [16] } Hetman Mazeppa was buried, in a brick tomb. The traces of Its inscription containing an eagle with one head [ April 2012 ] indicate Mazeppa and the Unkraine. The church was plundered in Tartar raids but two Galați suburbs, &quot; Mazeppa 1 and 2 &quot; are named for this man. [ Massacre of 1821 ] In the Greek-Turkish war of 1821, Ottomen subjects were killed in Galați (and in other towns). This was the result of a series of episodes of unrest among members of port workers&apos; association and city clerks. [ April 2012 ] [ Creation of Romania ] In 1837, Galați acquired the status of a free port. After the Crimean War of 1854-1856, the Danube European Commission created headquarters in Galați and Sulina.The governor of Galați, prior to 1859, was the chief magistrate Alexandru Ioan Cuza, (born Bârlad, 1820-1873). He was Prince of Wallachia and Moldavia and later, Domnitor (ruler) of the united Romanian principalities. His residence in Galați is now a museum. It is located on Al.I. Cuza street near the railway station. After the union of the Romanian principalities, development in Galați increased. A primary school opened on 26 October 1864: the École Superieure de Commerce &quot; Alexandru Ioan I &quot;. In 1867, the High School Alecsandri opened. From 1870 to 1908, the number of factories increased from a few to around 41. The historian, Stephen Zeletin wrote in his work, Romanian bourgeoisie that &quot; The birth of the modern Romanian must distinguish two main current, one noisy but superficial, ie the liberal ideas which depart from Paris to Bucharest and Iași, another silent but deep, leaving from London to Galați and Brăila: English is the current capitalist economy. &quot; [ Trade in the nineteenth century ] In the nineteenth century, commercial activity continued in Galați, for example, in grain exports. This was helped by the port&apos;s &quot; free &quot; status but on 22 December 1882 this status was revoked. Between 1900–1914, however, the city continued its trade in grain and also in timber. At the time, Galați hosted sixteen consulates. [ Twentieth century ] In 1907, unrest of the peasant classes precipitated the intervention of the Romanian army. In 1911, a statue of the poet Mihai Eminescu was erected.Prior to World War I, Galați was part of Covurlui county. (the county then re fascist Danube with Charles 2nd, after the Italian model.) [ April 2012 ] The 1930 census recorded approximately 112000 inhabitants of Galați. After Bucharest, Chișinău, Lași and Chernivtsi, Galați was Romania&apos;s fifth city.During the World War II, Galați was bombed by the German Luftwaffe. One building, inaugurated on 13 September 1872, was destroyed as were many other historic buildings and most of the old town. [ Mogosoaia boating tragedy ] On September 11, 1989, a Bulgarian ship collided with a cruise ship near Galati. All but sixteen passengers and crew perished. The &quot; Los Angeles Times &quot; reported, &quot; VIENNA — A Romanian ship collided with a Bulgarian tugboat and sank in the Danube River on Sunday, and 151 people were missing, Romania&apos;s official Agerpres news agency reported. A British newspaper said many of the passengers aboard were Western tourists. The collision occurred upstream of the port city of Galati, about 125 miles northeast of the Romanian capital of Bucharest, the report said, adding that the ship sank &quot; in conditions of poor visibility. &quot; http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-11/news/mn-1478_1_bulgarian-ship (from Associated Press) [ Historic events ] 1445: The first documentation of Galați. 1484: Galați remains Moldova&apos;s only port. 1590: Jewish cemetery opened. 1709: Hetman Ivan Stepanovich Mazeppa is buried in Galați. 1710: Tatars destroy Galați after battle of Stanilesti. 1775: Russian Empire establishes local consulate. 1789: Russian general Mikhail Kamensky burns Galați. 1805: France and England vice-consulates established. 1821: Galați massacre 1832: School of Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel opens. 1834: Austrian ships have scheduled arrivals. 1837: Galați is declared a free port. 1850: The United States establishes a vice-consulate. 1856: Galați becomes the seat of the Danube Commission. 1858: The United States establishes a consulate. 1864: Alexandru Ioan I. high school is opened. 1867: Alecsandri School is established (the National College). 1869: Mihai Eminescu municiple park opened. 1870: Factories open. 1872: King Charles I railway station and northern city rail tunnel opened.
