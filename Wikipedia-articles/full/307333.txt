[ the video game the series Banjo-Kazooie (series) ] [ June 30, 1998 July 17, 1998 July 24, 1998 ] { Xbox Live Arcade } [ December 3, 2008 December 3, 2008 December 3, 2008 ] { Platforming, } { action-adventure } { Single-player } [ G 3+ E B ] Banjo-Kazooie is a platform video game developed and published by Rare for the Nintendo 64 video game console. It was first released on June 30, 1998 in North America and on July 17, 1998 in Europe, and later re-released as an Xbox Live Arcade game for the Xbox 360 on December 3, 2008. The game was under development for more than two and a half years and was originally intended to be an adventure game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the first installment in the Banjo Kazooie series, and chronicles the titular characters&apos; encounter with series antagonist Gruntilda. The game&apos;s story focuses on Banjo and Kazooie&apos;s efforts to stop Gruntilda&apos;s plans to switch her beauty with Banjo&apos;s sister Tooty. The gameplay is very similar to that of Super Mario 64, even though Banjo-Kazooie has less emphasis on the platforming and more on exploration. Banjo-Kazooie was a critical and commercial success, selling nearly two million copies in the United States and receiving aggregated scores of 92% and 93% from Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. The game was praised for its detailed graphics, immersive sound, and intricate level design. In 1999, it received two awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences : &quot; Console Action Game of the Year &quot; and &quot; Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics &quot;. The critical and commercial success of Banjo-Kazooie led to the release of a sequel, Banjo-Tooie, which was also developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64. [ Plot ] Set in Spiral Mountain, Banjo-Kazooie follows the story of Banjo, a brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a red female bird who is always kept in Banjo&apos;s backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her cauldron that she is not the most beautiful girl of all, but instead a bear named Tooty, who is Banjo&apos;s sister. [ Banjo-Kazooie Rare Nintendo June 30, 1998 Nintendo 64 Opening sequence Dingpot:Err.. but there is this girl... / Gruntilda:What d&apos;you mean, this cannot be, there&apos;s no one prettier than me! / Dingpot:Why, it&apos;s Tooty, young and small, she&apos;s the prettiest girl of all! ] In retaliation, Gruntilda creates a machine which can transfer a person&apos;s level of beauty to another, with which she intends to use with Tooty.

[ Banjo-Kazooie Rare Nintendo June 30, 1998 Nintendo 64 Opening sequence Gruntilda:Come to me, my little pretty, you&apos;ll soon be ugly, what a pity! (swoops down and catches Tooty) ] In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from their friend, Bottles the mole, that Tooty was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda&apos;s lair.

Where did she go? / Bottles:She flew up to her mountain lair! It&apos;s really dangerous, so you&apos;ll probably need some training before you go up there! ] By the time most of the musical notes and jigsaw pieces are gathered, Banjo and Kazooie face Gruntilda in a trivia game show named &quot; Grunty&apos;s Furnace Fun &quot;. The game presents questions and challenges related to certain aspects of the game. After going through several game boards, the two win the game and Gruntilda flees. [ Banjo-Kazooie Rare Nintendo June 30, 1998 Nintendo 64 Grunty&apos;s Furnace Fun ] Reunited with Tooty, Banjo and Kazooie return home and celebrate with their friends with a barbecue. However, Tooty reminds everyone that Gruntilda has fled and tells Banjo and Kazooie to defeat her. [ Banjo-Kazooie Rare Nintendo June 30, 1998 Nintendo 64 Spiral Mountain Tooty:What&apos;s the party for? Grunty got away, so get back up there and finish the job! ] The pair return to Gruntilda&apos;s lair and use her cauldron to get to the top of the tower, where they confront the witch. Gruntilda attacks Banjo and Kazooie with her broom and energy blasts, but they summon five giant Jinjos, some friendly creatures, and destroy Gruntilda&apos;s broom. Banjo and Kazooie then use another giant Jinjo robot called the Jinjonator to send Gruntilda falling to her demise. [ Banjo-Kazooie Rare Nintendo June 30, 1998 Nintendo 64 Gruntilda&apos;s Lair ] Returning to their home, Banjo and Kazooie visit a beach with their friends and celebrate their victory. The game ends with Gruntilda swearing revenge against Banjo and Kazooie while her henchman Klungo tries to move the boulder covering her.

Collecting musical notes grants players access to new inner sections of the game&apos;s overworld. Banjo-Kazooie is a single-player platform game in which the player controls the protagonists Banjo and Kazooie. The game is split into nine open levels where the player must gather musical notes and jigsaw pieces, or &quot; Jiggies &quot;, in order to progress. [ Banjo-Kazooie Instruction Booklet Rare Staff NUS-NBKE-USA Nintendo 1998 ] Players transit from one level to another through Gruntilda&apos;s lair, which acts as the game&apos;s central overworld. Jiggies allow the player to complete jigsaw puzzles which open doors to new levels, while musical notes grant players access to new inner sections of the overworld. Like Super Mario 64, the gameplay is designed in a way that is very nonlinear, [ http://web.archive.org/web/20000303114356/www.next-generation.com/jsmid/previews/1922_2.html 2000-03-03 http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/previews/1922_2.html Banjo-Kazooie Next Generation Magazine 1998-04-07 2012-01-14 yes ] since players are not forced to collect all the jiggies and all the musical notes of one particular level to proceed through the next one. It is also possible to skip certain levels as long as the player has enough of these items to reach a farther one. Each level is composed of a number of challenges that include solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure game s. Players often have to speak with NPCs and then figure out a way to help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie&apos;s energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels. Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be executed; for instance, red feathers are used for Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers shield them from all damages. There are other items that allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment; for instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time. Banjo and Kazooie are occasionally aided by their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who can use magical powers to transform them into other creatures, such as a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a walrus, or a crocodile. These transformations have their own special features and allow the player to access areas that were previously inaccessible; for instance, the walrus can resist the effects of icy-cold water. Mumbo Tokens that are scattered throughout the game allow the transformation process. The game also includes cheats that the player can unlock by collecting spellbooks from Gruntilda&apos;s book Cheato. [ Development ] Banjo-Kazooie was developed by the same team that developed Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&apos;s Kong Quest. [ 2012-01-10 The Making of Banjo-Kazooie Retro Gamer 36 18–25 2007 March ] Development of the game began in late 1995 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System under the project name Dream and used Rare&apos;s &quot; ACM &quot; (Advanced Computer Modeling) graphics technology, first used in Donkey Kong Country, to a very advanced level. Dream was originally suggested as an adventure game that starred a boy named Edison, who owned a wooden sword and got into trouble with a group of pirates led by a captain named Blackeye. However, Edison was eventually replaced as Rare felt he was &quot; too generic &quot;. The developers first tried with a rabbit and later a bear, who became Banjo. The development was then transferred to the Nintendo 64. Around the same time, Rare was interested in making a more action-based game that focused totally on Banjo and his abilities. To this end, the team created Kazooie. &quot; We came up with the idea that a pair of wings could appear from [Banjo&apos;s] backpack to help him perform a &apos;double-jump&apos;, &quot; Gregg Mayles, director of the game, explained. &quot; We also wanted [him] to be able to run very fast when required... so we added a pair of &apos;fast-running&apos; legs that appeared from the bottom of the backpack... and soon [...] we came up with the logical conclusion that these could belong to another character, one that actually lived in Banjo&apos;s backpack. &quot; Instead of actual dialogue, the characters feature &quot; mumbling &quot; voices. This choice was made to convey their personalities without them actually speaking, as Rare believed the actual speech &quot; could ruin the player&apos;s perception of the characters. &quot; The game&apos;s soundtrack was composed by Grant Kirkhope, who also penned the music of GoldenEye 007. [ 2012-01-24 http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/919/919276p1.html 9 Videogame Composers to Watch IGN IGN Music 2008-10-13 ] The themes heard in the game were designed to be very interactive, which dynamically change to reflect the player&apos;s location. For example, whenever the player submerges in water, the music changes into a harp arrangement of the main world theme for an aquatic ambiance. The music gradually fades from one style to the next without pause, while the overall composition loops continuously. A soundtrack album of the game was later released in 1998. [ 2012-01-24 http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/b/banjo.shtml Banjo-Kazooie Game Soundtrack Square Enix Music ] Banjo-Kazooie also employed a very advanced technique to render the graphics. The characters were created with minimal amounts of texturing in order to give them a sharp and clean look, while the backgrounds often used very large textures split into 64*64 pieces, which was the largest texture size the Nintendo 64 could render. As a result, this technique caused significant memory fragmentation issues. However, the development team managed to create a proprietary system that could &quot; reshuffle &quot; memory as players played through the game to solve the fragmentation. According to lead programmer Chris Sutherland, &quot; I&apos;d doubt many N64 games of the time did anything like that &quot;. Rare also planned to include an additional game mode as well as more worlds to the game&apos;s current content, but time constraints dictated otherwise. In addition, a feature called &quot; Stop &apos;N&apos; Swop &quot;, which would apparently have allowed data to be transferred between both Banjo-Kazooie and its then-future sequel Banjo-Tooie, remains incomplete in the original version of the game. It was later revealed that one of the reasons the feature was never fully implemented was due to technical difficulties in the Nintendo 64 hardware.

It&apos;s all very Disney -esque. &quot; The sound effects received similar praise, with many editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters. The game was often called a Super Mario 64 clone for its similarity in gameplay. Gerstmann compared it favorably to Mario, saying that &quot; it doesn&apos;t stray too far from the formula, but it makes the logical progressions you would expect Nintendo to make. &quot; Game Informer observed that, while both games are very similar, Banjo-Kazooie has less emphasis on the platforming and more on exploration.
