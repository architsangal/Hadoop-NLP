[ For the video game, see Xenophobe (video game). ] Xenophobia is defined as &quot; an unreasonable Fear or hatred of foreigners or strangers or of that which is foreign or strange. &quot; { http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia } It comes from the Greek words ξένος (xenos), meaning &quot; stranger, &quot; &quot; foreigner, &quot; and φόβος (phobos), meaning &quot; fear. &quot; { Oxford Standard English Dictionary&apos; (OED). Oxford Press, 2004, CDROM version. } Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup, including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity. { Guido Bolaffi. Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. Pp. 332. } Xenophobia can also be exhibited in the form of an &quot; uncritical exaltation of another culture &quot; in which a culture is ascribed &quot; an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality &quot;. { Guido Bolaffi. Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. Pp. 332. } ↔==Definitions==Dictionary definitions of xenophobia include: deep-rooted, irrational hatred towards foreigners (Oxford English Dictionary; OED),unreasonable fear or hatred of the unfamiliar, especially people of other races (Webster&apos;s) { Webster&apos;s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, Dorset and Baber, Simon and Schuster } A clinical definition is: [ August 2010 ] An irrational fear of members of a certain race foreign to one&apos;s own, often adjunct and secondary to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Also: One of the attitude groupings characteristic of The Authoritarian Personality. { http://courses.ed.asu.edu/nelsen/edp530/pdf/Lect03Psychoanalysis.pdf } A Vietnam veteran witnessed members of the Viet Cong skinning his fellow soldiers alive. He developed hatred of people with Mongol eyelids. In both cases, the xenophobia was adjunct to PTSD. { 17 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 381 (1993-1994), From Agoraphobia to Xenophobia: Phobias and Other Anxiety Disorders under the Americans with Disabilities Act, John M. Casey } A xenophobic person has to genuinely think or believe at some level that the target is in fact a foreigner. This arguably separates xenophobia from racism and ordinary prejudice in that someone of a different race does not necessarily have to be of a different nationality. In various contexts, the terms &quot; xenophobia &quot; and &quot; racism &quot; seem to be used interchangeably, though they can have wholly different meanings (xenophobia can be based on various aspects, racism being based solely on race, ethnicity, and ancestry ). Xenophobia can also be directed simply to anyone outside a culture, not necessarily one particular race or people. [ Two forms ] The first is a population group present within a society that is not considered part of that society. [ July 2011 ] Often they are recent immigrants, but xenophobia may be directed against a group which has been present for centuries, or became part of this society through conquest and territorial expansion. This form of xenophobia can elicit or facilitate hostile and violent reactions, such as mass expulsion of immigrants, pogroms or in other cases, genocide. The second form of xenophobia is primarily cultural, and the objects of the phobia are cultural elements which are considered alien. All cultures are subject to external influences, but cultural xenophobia is often narrowly directed, for instance, at foreign loan words in a national language. It rarely leads to aggression against individual persons, but can result in political campaigns for cultural or linguistic purification. In addition, entire xenophobic societies tend not to be open to interactions from anything &quot; outside &quot; themselves, resulting in isolationism that can further xenophobia. [ Ways of acquiring ] the following is a list of way for develop a general, but most time specific type of Xenophobia: bad emotional experience with other groups or specific alien populist group. allegedly rational, or, analytical reasons for the revulsion. Classical conditioning, that is when someone is conditioned to having a fear or repulse from aliens generally, or, from specific group. ways to instill it would be Dehumanization, mostly by propaganda, for example: a video containing group members shown distorted, erroneous, and in proportional phases of horror sounding. imitating others, mainly these that are close to the individual, or, in many cases, societal norms of a nation.
