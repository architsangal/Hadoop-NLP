{ International Space Station } A space station (or orbital station) is a spacecraft capable of supporting a crew which is designed to remain in space (most commonly in low Earth orbit ) for an extended period of time, and to which other spacecraft can dock. A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems. Instead other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station. [ 2011 10 ] two space stations are in orbit; the International Space Station, and China&apos;s Tiangong 1. { (successfully launched on September 29, 2011 after a delay) } [ http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/09/china-major-human-space-flight-milestone-tiangong-1s-launch/ China launches TianGong-1 to mark next human space flight milestone Rui Barbosa NASASpaceflight.com ] Previous stations include the Almaz and Salyut series, Skylab and most recently Mir. Space stations are used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body as well as to provide platforms for greater number and length of scientific studies than available on other space vehicles. All space stations have been designed with the intention of rotating multiple crews, with each crew member staying aboard the station for weeks or months, but rarely more than a year. Since the ill-fated flight of Soyuz 11 to Salyut 1, all manned spaceflight duration records have been set aboard space stations. The duration record for a single spaceflight is 437.7 days, set by Valeriy Polyakov aboard Mir from 1994 to 1995. [ 2011 ], three astronauts have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard Mir. Space stations have been used for both military and civilian purposes. The last military-use space station was Salyut 5, which was used by the Almaz program of the Soviet Union in 1976 and 1977. { Russian Space Stations (wikisource) } [ History ] [ Early concepts ] The Brick Moon, first known depiction of a space station. [ History of spaceflight ] Space stations have been envisaged since at least 1869 when Everett Hale wrote about a &apos;brick moon&apos; in Atlantic monthly magazine. { The First Space Station, Boy&apos;s Life, September 1989. } Space stations were also later envisaged by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Hermann Oberth. In 1929 Herman Potočnik &apos;s The Problem of Space Travel was published, and remained popular for over 30 years. In 1951, in Collier&apos;s weekly, Wernher von Braun published his design for a wheel-shaped space station. During the Second World War German scientists researched an orbital weapon that could utilize the sun&apos;s energy. This so-called &quot; sun gun &quot; would be part of a space station orbiting Earth at a height of [ 5,100 mi km ]. [ July 09, 1945 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C852344-1%2C00.html Science: Sun Gun Time Magazine ] With the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon in July 1969, the United States won the race to the Moon over the world&apos;s other superpower of the era, the Soviet Union. { Ivanovich, p.5 } This caused the Soviet Union to seek other ways to display their spaceflight capabilities. [ Salyut, Almaz, and Skylab (1971–1986) ] [ Salyut program Almaz Skylab ] The first space station was Salyut 1, which was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971. Like all the early space stations, it was &quot; monolithic &quot;, intended to be constructed and launched in one piece, and then manned by a crew later. As such, monolithic stations generally contained all their supplies and experimental equipment when launched, and were considered &quot; expended &quot;, and then abandoned, when these were used up. The earlier Soviet stations were all designated &quot; Salyut &quot;, but among these there were two distinct types: civilian and military. The military stations, Salyut 2, Salyut 3, and Salyut 5, were also known as Almaz stations. The civilian stations Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 were built with two docking ports, which allowed a second crew to visit, bringing a new spacecraft with them; the Soyuz ferry could spend 90 days in space, after which point it needed to be replaced by a fresh Soyuz spacecraft. [ http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf Mir Hardware Heritage D.S.F. Portree NASA 1995 30 November 2010 ] This allowed for a crew to man the station continually. Skylab was also equipped with two docking ports, like second-generation stations, but the extra port was never utilized. The presence of a second port on the new stations allowed Progress supply vehicles to be docked to the station, meaning that fresh supplies could be brought to aid long-duration missions. This concept was expanded on Salyut 7, which &quot; hard docked &quot; with a TKS tug shortly before it was abandoned; this served as a proof-of-concept for the use of modular space stations. The later Salyuts may reasonably be seen as a transition between the two groups. [ Mir (1986–1998) ] [ Mir ] Earth and the &apos;&apos;Mir&apos;&apos; station Unlike previous stations, the Soviet space station Mir had a modular design; a core unit was launched, and additional modules, generally with a specific role, were later added to that. This method allows for greater flexibility in operation, as well as removing the need for a single immensely powerful launch vehicle. Modular stations are also designed from the outset to have their supplies provided by logistical support, which allows for a longer lifetime at the cost of requiring regular support launches. [ ISS (1998–present) ] [ International Space Station ] The core module of the International Space Station was launched in 1998. The ISS is divided into two main sections, the Russian orbital segment (ROS), and the United States operational segment (USOS). USOS modules were brought to the station by the Space Shuttle and manually attached to the ISS by crews during EVAs. Connections are made manually for electrical, data, propulsion and cooling fluids. This results in a single piece which is not designed for disassembly. [ http://search.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id%3D9794%26amp%3Bpage%3D28 0-309-06938-6 National Academies Press 2000 28–30 Thomas Kelly, et al. Engineering Challenges to the Long-Term Operation of the International Space Station ] The Russian orbital segment&apos;s modules are able to launch, fly and dock themselves without human intervention using Proton rockets. { http://www.usu.edu/mae/aerospace/publications/JDSC_RoadToAutonomy.pdf } Connections are automatically made for power, data and propulsion fluids and gases. The Russian approach allows assembly of space stations orbiting other worlds in preparation for manned missions. The Nauka module of the ISS will be used in the 12th Russian(/Soviet) space station, OPSEK, whose main goal is supporting manned deep space exploration. Russian Modular or &apos;next generation&apos; space stations differ from &apos;Monolithic&apos; single piece stations by allowing reconfiguration of the station to suit changing needs. According to a 2009 report, RKK Energia is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the Russian Orbital Segment when the end of mission is reached for the ISS and use them as a basis for a new station, known as the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex. None of these modules would have reached the end of their useful lives in 2016 or 2020. The report presents a statement from an unnamed Russian engineer who believes that, based on the experience from Mir, a thirty-year life should be possible, except for micrometeorite damage, because the Russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind.

The unmanned Shenzhou 8 then successfully performed an automatic rendezvous and docking in November 2011. The manned Shenzhou 9 and Shenzhou 10 are expected to visit Tiangong-1 in 2012. Two more space stations, Tiangong 2 and Tiangong 3 are expected to be launched in subsequent years, paving the way for the construction of a larger space station around 2020. [ Habitability ] [ Effect of spaceflight on the human body ] These stations have various issues that limit their long-term habitability, such as very low recycling rates, relatively high radiation levels and a lack of gravity. Some of these problems cause discomfort and long-term health effects. In the case of solar flares, all current habitats are protected by the Earth&apos;s magnetic field, and are below the Van Allen belts. Future space habitat s may attempt to address these issues, and are intended for long-term occupation. Some designs might even accommodate large numbers of people, essentially &quot; cities in space &quot; where people would make their homes. No such design has yet been constructed, since even for a small station, the current (2010) launch costs are not economically or politically viable. Possible ways to deal with these costs would be to build a large number of rockets (economies of scale), employ reusable rockets, In Situ Resource Utilisation, or non-rocket spacelaunch methods such as space elevator s. For example, in 1975, proposing to seek long-term habitability through artificial gravity and enough mass in space to allow high radiation shielding, the most ambitious historical NASA study, a conceptual 10000-person spacestation, envisioned a future mass driver base launching 600 times its own mass in lunar material cumulatively over years. { NASA, 1975: Space Settlements: A Design Study.

The U.S. Space Station Freedom program, which, despite being under development for ten years, was never launched, instead evolving into the International Space Station The Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, which was never constructed, had some of its elements incorporated into the International Space Station. [ Houston Chronicle Space station idea was far-out at the time http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/5083015.html Kaplan David August 25, 2007 2007-08-26 ] The Industrial Space Facility was a station proposed in the 1980s that was to be privately funded. The project was canceled when the company created to build it, Space Industries Incorporated, was unable to secure funding from the United States government. The European Columbus project planned to create a small space station serviced by the Hermes shuttle. It evolved into the ISS Columbus module. [ Future developments ] The People&apos;s Republic of China is expected to launch two more space labs called Tiangong 2 and Tiangong 3 before 2016. It will then launch a three module 60-ton space station by 2022. Project 921-2 is the working name given by the People&apos;s Republic of China for plans to create a manned space station. The public is being asked to submit suggestions for names and symbols to adorn the planned Chinese space station.
