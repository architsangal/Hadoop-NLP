His name was spelled Ryuduan bin Isomuddin by Scott McClellan during a press briefing. McClellan spelled his name letter by letter. His name is spelled Riduan Isamuddin in the report of the 9-11 Commission. His name was spelled Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin by the US Treasury. [ Jemaah Islamiah ] [ March 2009 ] He returned to Cianjur for one week, before going to Malaysia, in 1991 where he met the two co-founders of JI, Abdullah Sungkar and Abubakar Bashir, who fled President Suharto &apos;s &quot; New Order &quot; in 1985. Nurjaman internationalized the terrorist group&apos;s activities. Nurjaman then took a new name in his permanent residence permit. He now was Riduan Isamuddin. The three lived in a housing compound in Kampung Sungai Manggis, Banting, Selangor. His nickname, Hambali, is after Hanbali, a school of religious law started by a revered Islam ic imam from the 8th century. The two co-founders sent their students to &quot; study &quot; in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The students actually fought the Soviets until the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan. A woman named Noralwizah Lee Abdullah had gone to Malaysia for religious schooling. She secretly married Isamuddin after meeting him at the Luqmanul Hakiem School in Ulu Tiram, Johor. The school was founded by Sungkar and Bashir. Initially, Isamuddin struggled to make a living for his family. He switched from selling kebabs to patenting medicines. He soon disappeared from his home for weeks at a time, and he received many visitors at home. He eventually came to own a red hatchback and several cell phones. Investigators say that many calls on those cell phones were made to Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, Osama bin Laden&apos;s brother in law, who had arrived back in Manila, Philippines in 1991. After Arab visitors gave his family lots of money, he founded a shell company, Konsojaya, in June 1994. Ostensibly an import-export company trading in palm oil between Malaysia and Afghanistan, it was essentially a front company for terrorism. [ February 2008 ] Wali Khan Amin Shah, who would become the financier of Operation Bojinka, was a director of Konsojaya. The company provided financial assistance to the project until it was discovered by investigators on a laptop computer after an apartment fire on January 6, 1995. Shah was arrested in the Philippines but escaped on a short order. Shah was arrested in Malaysia in December 1995. Both Shah and mastermind Ramzi Yousef, who escaped the Philippines but was arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, were extradited to the United States. They were both convicted and sentenced to life in prison for participating in the project. [ Hambali goes underground ] Hambali&apos;s company attracted attention of investigators so his dealings went quiet for a while. [ February 2008 ] He decided to preach, raise money, and recruit for his cause. He went underground in 2000 and started a wave of church-bombings in Indonesia. He always had a &quot; hands-on &quot; technique; he met his foot soldiers and came to them &quot; with detailed plans, plenty of cash and two of his own bombmakers. &quot; He always fled before the bombing commenced. Meanwhile, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, Abu Bakr Bashir, was preaching jihad at his schools while denying links to Islamic militants. [ February 2008 ] Hambali planned and attended the January 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Among the others present were two September 11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. This gathering in Kuala Lumpur was observed by the CIA and Malaysian authorities, but what specifically was being said at the meetings was not picked up. Hambali also provided money and documents to Zacarias Moussaoui in October of that year. After the Bali nightclub bombing, in which 202 people were killed, Hambali received more attention from the United States. In the years leading up to the attack, the Indonesian government&apos;s action against Islamic militants had been minimal. Following the attack, Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested as part of a crack down on Jemaah Islamiah. He was wanted in Indonesia [ http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/16/1034561203790.html Hunt for Hambali - the Osama of the Far East Sydney Morning Herald 16 October 2002 2008-03-01 ] for the bombings of several churches in the region, and wanted for the Bali bombing and a failed plot on several targets in Singapore. [ Capture ] Hambali used a series of safe-houses throughout Southeast Asia, especially Thailand and Cambodia, to move around. While he was in Ayutthaya, Thailand, 75 kilometers north of Bangkok, he was planning a terrorist attack against several Thai hotels and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (APEC) in Bangkok on October 2003. Hambali had used a false Spanish passport to enter Thailand while his wife used her Malaysian passport. Thai police found him as part of a joint operation between the Thai police and the CIA on August 11, 2003. The twenty uniformed and undercover police smashed down the door to his one bedroom apartment in Ayutthaya, and arrested him and 33-year-old Noralwizah Lee Abdullah, a Chinese Malaysia n who was considered to be his wife. Hambali was wearing a pair of jeans, a t-shirt, a baseball cap, and a pair of sunglasses. Police also seized explosive s and firearm s in the property. It marked the end of a 20-month hunt for Hambali, who was 37 years of age when he was captured. A 2006 Human Rights Watch report stated that Hambali was imprisoned in Jordan for the account of the CIA. [ February 2007 ] On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush confirmed that Hambali had been held by the CIA and revealed that he had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay.

[ February 2007 ] Hambali is also wanted in the Philippines for the transfer of explosives on Filipino soil in an attempt to transport them to Singapore. [ Detention ] Following his capture the USA would not confirm or deny that he was in their custody. But on September 6, 2006, President Bush acknowledged { Bush: CIA holds terror suspects in secret prisons, CNN, 7 September 2006. } the existence of covert, overseas CIA interrogation centres (colloquially known as black site s ) and announced that 14 high-profile members al Qaeda and related groups had been transported from those sites to Guantanamo Bay. { Biographies of 14 Guantanamo Bay detainees, } { Office of the Director of National Intelligence } Those 14 include Hambali and an alleged lieutenant of his called Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep alias Lillie or Li-Li.
