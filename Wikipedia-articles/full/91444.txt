The former ignited fence cutting wars in the county, and the latter of which bankrupted the Half Circle S ranch. Fence Cutting War s in Texas lasted for approximately five years, 1883-1888. As open range areas gave way to farming homesteaders who fenced their land, cattlemen found it more difficult to feed their herds. In some cases, large land owners would also fence public land as their property. As water and grass became more scarce in a drought, cowboys cut through fences. Newspapers condemned the fence cutters, and property owners employed their own armed security forces. Texas Governor John Ireland prodded a special assembly to order the fence cutters to cease. In response, the legislature made fence-cutting and pasture-burning crimes punishable with prison time, while at the same time regulating fencing While the practice abated, sporadic incidents of related violence continued through 1888.
