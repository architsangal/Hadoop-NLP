It was named after the Chickasaw tribe, which lived in the Southern United States at the time. The first white settlers came in 1848 and the first county seat was from 1854 in Bradford, in the southwestern corner of the county. In the spring of 1857, the seat was moved to New Hampton, located near the geographic center, and was then called Chickasaw Center. The first offices needed of the county government were housed in private houses and the school building. In 1865, the first courthouse was erected, which was expanded in 1876, and completely destroyed by a fire on March 26, 1880. { Chickasaw County } [ Demographics ] [ http://www.iowadatacenter.org/archive/2011/02/feb10 Data from the 2010 Census State Data Center of Iowa March 9, 2011 ] [ 2010 census ] The 2010 census recorded a population of 12,439 in the county, with a population density of [ 12439 505 sqmi km2 ].
