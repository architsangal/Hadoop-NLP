As of the United States 2010 Census, the population was 783,969, a decrease of 9,664 (-1.2%) from the 793,633 enumerated in the 2000 Census, making it the third-most populous county in the state and one of only two counties in the state to see a decline in population during the decade ( Cape May County was the other). { Table 1. The Counties and Most Populous Cities and Townships in 2010 in New Jersey: 2000 and 2010, } { United States Census Bureau. Accessed April 9, 2012. } Its county seat is Newark. [ 6 ] It is part of the New York Metropolitan Area. The Bureau of Economic Analysis ranked the county as having the 94th-highest per capita income of all 3,113 counties in the United States (and the seventh-highest in New Jersey) as of 2009. { 250 Highest Per Capita Personal Incomes of the 3113 Counties in the United States, 2009, } { Bureau of Economic Analysis. Accessed April 9, 2012. } [ Overview ] The county is named after Essex, a county in east England. Essex County is the second most densely populated county in the state after Hudson County. { Buying a Home in Jersey City, New Jersey – Real Estate Agents in Jersey City – Homes in Jersey City } Newark, with a population density of 11,400 people/square mile, is the largest municipality in the county both in terms of area (24.14 square miles) and population (280,000). Meanwhile, Caldwell is the smallest in terms of land area (1.2 square miles) and Essex Fells has the smallest population (2,071); nevertheless, even these small municipalities have population densities (6,396 people/square mile and 1,534 people/square mile, respectively) that rival many big cities, and are well above the state&apos;s average, which in turn is the highest in the nation. Like many of the counties of Northern New Jersey near New York City — which tend to have sharp divides between relatively rich suburban neighborhoods and less wealthy, more densely-populated cities nearby — the eastern region of Essex County tends to be poorer and more urbanized, while the western parts tend to be more affluent and suburban. Eastern Essex This wide area has significant pockets of areas that qualify as inner-city : high building density, high poverty and high crime rates and underperforming school systems. Within this general area however are many stable, mixed and middle-income areas of diverse populations. For example, north and west sides of Newark have well-kept suburban areas such as Vailsburg and Forest Hill, Newark, New Jersey. The east side of Newark is the Ironbound, a thriving Brazilian and Portuguese community. East Orange has the Presidential Estate neighborhood full of large one family homes. Belleville and Bloomfield are old Italian cities that, in spite of retaining a core Italian-American population, now have many immigrants from Latin America and Asia. According to Epodunk, as of 2009, Nutley was 36% Italian. Beginning at about the turn of the century, this region led the state in the rebuilding and rehab of its housing stock. In the 2000s, Newark led the state in the issuance of building permits. Many reasons were cited: city-wide incentives to encourage construction development, an improving local economy, the rising demand of low-cost housing so close to Manhattan. Newark has since then become one of the fastest growing cities in the entire Northeast. { Roberts, Sam. &quot; Biggest Urban Growth Is in South and West &quot;, June 28, 2007. Accessed November 13, 2007. } { Census data for Newark, New Jersey, accessed November 14, 2006 } and reported a gain in median income and drop in poverty rate. { Newark city, New Jersey – Fact Sheet – American FactFinder } This is a welcome turnaround to the deterioration and abandonment, experienced in the post-riot 70s, 80s and early part of the 90s. Crime in this part of the county has traditionally been among the highest in the state and the country as well, but recently has also seen significant declines, mirroring its large neighbor to the east, New York City. { Wang, Katie. &quot; County reports largest drop is in violent crime &quot;, } { The Star-Ledger, October 17, 2007. Accessed November 13, 2007. &quot; For the second year in a row, overall crime in Essex County dropped by 10 percent, according to the annual crime statistics released by the State Police yesterday.

In 2008, Newark had 67 homicides, down from 105 in 2007 and the record of 161 murders set in 1981. { Lueck, Thomas J. &quot; As Newark Mayor Readies Crime Fight, Toll Rises &quot;, } { The New York Times, January 8, 2007.

Within this region are some of the most diverse and racially integrated municipalities in the state and nation, including Montclair, South Orange and Maplewood. As well, many neighborhoods are well-known magnets for New Yorkers such as Glen Ridge, Montclair, Verona and the Oranges. The communities of Livingston, Roseland, South Orange, Millburn, North Caldwell, and Essex Fells are some of the wealthiest towns in America. Short Hills, South Orange, and Livingston are regionally well known as affluent Jewish-American suburbs. Livingston also has a burgeoning Taiwanese-American population, many of whom are highly educated white collar professionals with Ivy League degrees. Short Hills has a popular upscale shopping mall, the Short Hills Mall.
