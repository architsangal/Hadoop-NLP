Production started in 1996 and the first aircraft entered service in 2000. The first 76 aircraft entered service in 2008, with a total of 94 airframes under contract. In FY2005, Ministry of Defense changed the category from Support Fighter to Fighter. } [ Development ] Work started in the FS-X program, and began in earnest with a memorandum of understanding between Japan and the United States. It would lead to a new fighter based on the General Dynamics (post 1993, Lockheed Martin ) F-16 Fighting Falcon, and in particular the F-16 Agile Falcon proposal. Lockheed Martin was chosen as the major subcontractor to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and the two companies co-developed and co-produced the aircraft. Some of the early developmental works were actually done under General Dynamics, who sold its aircraft division to Lockheed Martin in 1993. It is essentially an execution of the F-16 Agile Falcon proposal: a late-1980s plan for an enlarged F-16 which was passed over by the U.S. in favor of an all-new fighter program ( Joint Strike Fighter ). The F-2 used the wing design of the F-16 Agile Falcon, but much of the electronics were further updated to 1990s standards. The overall concept of the enlarged F-16 by General Dynamics was intended as a cheap counter to the then emerging threat of Su-27 / MiG-29. In October 1987, Japan selected the F-16 as the basis of its new secondary fighter, { Aoki 1999, p.40. } to replace the aging Mitsubishi F-1 and supplement its main air superiority fighter, the F-15J as well as the F-4EJ. The programme involved technology transfer from the USA to Japan, and responsibility for cost sharing was split 60% by Japan and 40% by USA. { http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/f2/ } Also during the 1980s, General Dynamics (who developed the F-16) had proposed its F-16 Agile Falcon to the USAF. While the US would pass over the design concept in favor of all-new types ( F-22 /JSF) and upgrades to its existing fleet, the enlarged F-16 would find a home in Japan. { Mitsubishi AAM-4 air-to-air missile } The F-2 program was controversial, because the unit cost, which includes development costs, is roughly four times that of a Block 50/52 F-16, which does not include development costs. Inclusion of development costs distorts the incremental unit cost (this happens with most modern military aircraft), though even at the planned procurement levels, the price per aircraft was somewhat high. The initial plan of 141 F-2s would have reduced the unit cost by up to [ 10 million ] per unit, not including reduced cost from mass production. As of 2008, 94 aircraft were planned. Also controversial is the amounts claimed to be paid to American side as various licensing fees, although making use of the pre-existing technology was much cheaper than trying to develop it from scratch. The Japanese may eventually make up to 94, at a cost of roughly US$ 110 million each in 2004 dollars. Much of the F-16 technology used in the F-2 was the subject of some political debate in the U.S. and Japan in the early 1990s. The technology transfers were authorized however, and the project proceeded. The F-2&apos;s maiden flight was on 7 October 1995. Later that year, the Japanese government approved an order for 141 (but that was soon cut to 130), to enter service by 1999; structural problems resulted in service entry being delayed until 2000. Because of issues with cost-efficiency, orders for the aircraft were curtailed to 98 in 2004. The last of 94 aircraft ordered under contract was delivered to the Defense Ministry on 27 September 2011. { Jiji Press, &quot; Final F-2 fighter delivered to ASDF &quot;, } { Japan Times, 29 September 2011, p. 2. } During the roll-out ceremony of the last production F-2 fighter jet, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries confirmed that production of the F-2 would end and no more F-2 fighters will be produced by the manufacturer.

Lockheed Martin supplies the aft fuselage, leading edge slats, stores management system, a large portion of wing boxes (as part of two-way technology transfer agreements), [ http://airforceworld.com/fighter/eng/f2.htm Mitsubishi F-2 Fighter Japan Technology Transfer Agreement AirForceWorld.com 1 July 2011 ] and other components. { Lockheed Martin Press Release April 8, 2008 } Kawasaki builds the midsection of the fuselage, as well as the doors to the main wheel and the engine, while forward fuselage and wings are built by Mitsubishi. Avionics are supplied by Lockheed Martin, and the digital fly-by-wire system has been jointly developed by Japan Aviation Electric and Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal). Contractors for communication systems and IFF interrogators include Raytheon, NEC, Hazeltine, and Kokusai Electric. Final assembly is done in Japan, by MHI at its Komaki-South facility in Nagoya. Larger wings give better payload and maneuverability, but also tend to add weight to the airframe in various ways. More weight can have negative effects on acceleration, climbing, payload, and range. To make the larger wings lighter the skin, spars, ribs and cap of the wings were made from graphite-epoxy composite and co-cured together in an autoclave. This was the first application of co-cured technology to a production tactical fighter. [ http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/f2/ F-2 Attack Fighter, Japan Airforce-technology.com 22 Apr 2012 ] This technology for the wings encountered some teething problems, but proved to be a leading-edge use of a technology that provides weight savings, improved range, and some stealth benefits. This technology was then transferred back to America, as part of the program’s industrial partnership.

F-2 platform compared to F-16 Some differences in the F-2 from the F-16A: a 25% larger wing area composite materials used to reduce overall weight and radar signature longer and wider nose to accommodate a phased-array radar larger tailplane larger air intake three-piece cockpit canopy capabilities for four ASM-1 or ASM-2 anti-ship missiles, four AAMs, and additional fuel tank s Also, the F-2 is equipped with a drogue parachute, like the version of the F-16 used by Netherlands, Norway, Greece, Turkey, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Venezuela.

The jet was being taken up on a test flight by Mitsubishi employees, after major maintenance and before being delivered to the JSDF. Both test pilots survived the incident with only minor injuries. http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071101a2.html Japan Times It was eventually determined that improper wiring caused the crash. http://huhcanitbetrue.blogspot.com/2008/01/f2mhi.html http://www.f-16.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2 &amp; file=viewtopic &amp; p=112537 As a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, 18 F-2Bs belonging to the 21st Fighter Squadron at Matsushima Air Base were damaged or destroyed. http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0312/TKY201103110818.html http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/03/earthquake-devastates-japan-f-.html Of these 18, 12 were deemed beyond repair and will be scrapped. The remaining 6 F-2s will be repaired at the estimated cost of ¥ 80 billion yen. http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201109150442.html In the meantime, training duties carried out by the 21st Fighter Squadron have been transferred to other air bases.
