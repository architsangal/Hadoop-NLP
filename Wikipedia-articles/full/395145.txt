He is remembered as a proto- anthropologist for his detailed accounts of the many tribes of American Indians, first published in 1542 as La Relación (The Report), and later known as Naufragios (Shipwrecks). [ Early life and education ] Cabeza de Vaca was born around 1490 into a hidalgo family, and as such was a member of the Spanish nobility without economic resources. Cabeza de Vaca was the son of Teresa Cabeza de Vaca y de Zurita. In 16th-century documents, his name appeared as &quot; Alvar nuñez cabeza de vaca &quot;. Cabeza de Vaca means &quot; head of cow &quot;. This surname was granted to his mother&apos;s family in the 13th century, when his ancestor Martín Alhaja aided a Christian army attacking Moors by leaving a cow&apos;s head to point out a small secret mountain pass for their use. (In the prologue to La Relación, his account of his shipwreck and travels in North America, Cabeza de Vaca refers to his forefather&apos;s service to the King, and regrets that his own deeds could not be as great. as he thought [ Narváez Expedition and early Indian relations ] In early 1527, Cabeza de Vaca departed Spain as a part of a royal expedition to occupy the mainland of North America. As treasurer, he was one of the chief officers on the Narváez expedition. [ Reséndez Andrés Andrés Reséndez Fall 2008 A Desperate Trek Across America American Heritage 58 5 American Heritage Publishing http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2008/5/2008_5_19.shtml 2010-07-26 ] Within several months of their landing near Tampa Bay, Florida on April 15, 1528, he and three other men would be the only survivors of the expedition party of 600 men. [ Cabeza de, Vaca 1542 Chap&apos;s II-III ] As the navigators were unsure of their location, Cabeza de Vaca thought it prudent to keep the land and sea forces together. Narváez and the other officers, excited by rumors of gold, overruled him and started off on a march through Florida, promptly getting lost. After several months of fighting native inhabitants through wilderness and swamp, the party reached Apalachee Bay with 242 men. They believed they were near other Spaniards in Mexico, but there were in fact 1500 miles of coast between them. The men were starving, wounded, sick, and lost in swampy terrain, but came up with a plan for escape. Slaughtering and eating their horses, they melted down stirrups, spurs, horseshoes and other metal items, and fashioned a bellows from deerhide to make a fire hot enough to forge tools and nails. They constructed five primitive boats to use in search of Mexico. Cabeza de Vaca commanded one of these vessels, each of which had room for only 50 men. Depleted of food and water, they followed the coast westward, until they reached the mouth of the Mississippi River. The current swept them into the Gulf and the five rafts were separated by a hurricane, some lost forever, including that of Narváez. Two craft with about 40 survivors, including Cabeza de Vaca, wrecked on or near Galveston Island. The explorers called it Malhado ( &quot; Misfortune &quot; ), or the Island of Doom. [ MM/rrm1 Malhado Island Donald E. Chipman 2008-08-07 ] They made an attempt to repair the rafts, using what remained of their own clothes as oakum to plug holes, but they lost the rafts to a large wave. As the number of survivors dwindled rapidly, they were enslaved for a few years by various American Indian tribes of the upper Gulf Coast. These included the Hans and the Capoques, and tribes later called the Karankawa and Coahuiltecan s. Only four men, Cabeza de Vaca, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, and an enslaved Moroccan Berber named Esteban (later called Estevanico ), survived and escaped to reach Mexico City. Traveling mostly in this small group, Cabeza de Vaca explored what is now the U.S. state of Texas, as well as the northeastern Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, and possibly smaller portions of New Mexico and Arizona. He traveled on foot along the then-Spanish territories of Texas and the coast. He continued through Coahuila and Nueva Vizcaya; then down the Gulf of California coast to what is now Sinaloa, Mexico, over a period of roughly eight years. He lived in conditions of abject poverty and, occasionally, in slavery. During his wanderings, passing from tribe to tribe, Cabeza de Vaca developed sympathies for the indigenous population. He became a trader, which allowed him freedom to travel among the tribes. Cabeza de Vaca comprehended his survival and journey in religious terms, in that he claimed to have been guided by God to learn to heal the sick. He gained such notoriety as a faith healer that he and his companions gathered a large following of natives who regarded them as &quot; children of the sun &quot;, endowed with the power to both heal and destroy. Many natives accompanied the men across what is now the American Southwest and Northern Mexico. After finally reaching the colonized lands of New Spain where he encountered fellow Spaniards near modern-day Culiacán, Cabeza de Vaca went on to Mexico City. From there he sailed back to Europe in 1537. Numerous researchers have struggled to trace the exact route travelled by Cabeza de Vaca. As he did not begin writing his chronicle until back in Spain, he had to rely on memory. Cabeza de Vaca was uncertain of the route he traversed. Historians realize that his account has numerous errors in chronology and geography, but many have tried to put together pieces of the puzzle to discern his paths. [ Return to America ] In 1540, Cabeza de Vaca was appointed adelantado of the Río de la Plata in South America. His mission was to re-establish the settlement of Buenos Aires in present-day Argentina. { Iguazu Falls. } En route, he disembarked from his fleet at Santa Catarina Island in modern Brazil. With an indigenous force, 250 musketeers and 26 horses, he followed native trails { p. 128, Caminhos da Conquista: Formação do Espaço Brasileiro, Vallandro Keating and Ricardo Maranhão, ed. Terceiro Nome, São Paulo, 2008 } discovered by Aleixo Garcia overland to the district&apos;s Spanish capital, Asunción, far inland on the great Paraguay River. Cabeza de Vaca is thought to have been the first European to see the Iguaçu Falls. The honor probably belongs to his scouts. Cabeza de Vaca had an unusually benevolent attitude for his time toward the American Indians. The elite settlers, known as encomenderos, generally did not share this attitude and simply wanted to use the natives for labor. His loss of the elite support, together with the failure of Buenos Aires as a settlement, prompted the former governor Domingo Martínez de Irala to arrest Cabeza de Vaca for poor administration in 1544 and return him to Spain for trial in 1545. Although eventually exonerated, Cabeza de Vaca never returned to the colony. He wrote an extensive report on South America, which was highly critical of Martínez de Irala. The report was bound with his earlier La Relación and published under the title Comentarios (Commentary). He died poor in Seville around the year 1558. [ &quot; The Relation of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca &quot; ] “The Relation of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vadca” is Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his experiences on what is now known as Galveston Island, Texas. In November of 1528, Cabeza de Vaca and his depleted crew of three men wrecked on Galveston Island and were forced to fight for survival. {, Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. } They wandered along the Texas coast as prisoners of the Han and Capoque American Indians for two years, while Cabeza de Vaca observed the people, picking up on their ways of life and customs. { Baym, Nina. &quot; Álvar Núñez Cabeza De Vaca. &quot; The Norton Anthology of American Literature. 7th ed. Vol. A. New York: W.W. Norton, 2007. 40-48. Print. } In 1537, Cabeza de Vaca returned to Spain, writing down his narratives of the expedition. These narratives were collected and published in 1542 in Spain. Collectively, they are now known as “The Relation of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca.” The narrative of Cabeza de Vaca is the “first European book devoted completely to North America.” Cabeza de Vaca showed compassion and respect for the native peoples and more details, which distinguished this account from others. His account shows a detailed look into the lives of the American Indians at the time. [ Role of Watcher ] In the narrative, Cabeza de Vaca serves as a reporter on the customs and ways of American Indian life. Being one of the first explorers stranded on the so-called Island of Doom, Cabeza de Vaca takes it upon himself to watch the people and make observations on their lifestyles. He spent eight years with various groups of people, including the Capoque, Han, Avavares, and Arbadaos people. He reveals details about the culture of the Malhado people, the Capoque and Han American Indians, such as their treatment of offspring, wedding rites, and their main sources of food. Cabeza de Vaca and his other three explorers are said to have served as slaves to the American Indians so as to be cared for by these American Indians. In this manner, he was better able to observe as he did not have to concern himself with matters of survival. Cabeza de Vaca serves as guide to the ways of early American Indian life near the Mexico-Texas border. [ Persona ] Cabeza de Vaca wrote this narrative to Charles V to literally “transmit what I saw and heard in the nine years I wandered lost and miserable over many remote lands.” He says he wants to convey “not merely a report of positions and distances, flora and fauna, but of the customs of the numerous indigenous people I talked with and dwelt among, as well as any other matters I could hear of or observe.” He attempts to be factual in the manner of an accountant, which was his job in this expedition. “The Relation of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca.” is the only account we have of many details about indigenous people that he encountered and things these people spoke about to him but they have been sufficiently validated by reports of the experiences of others and in the oral tradition of the tribes. [ American Indian nations noted by name in the Relacion ] Cabeza De Vaca wrote about native tribes with whom he stayed during his journey from the place now known as Galveston Island, Texas in 1528, to present day, Culiacán, Mexico in 1536. Below is a list from his record. Shown with the names he used for them are the names given to these indigenous tribes by those who studied them in 1919. { &quot; The First Europeans in Texas &quot;, Southwestern Historical Quarterly Vol 22 1919 } Possible Karankawa n groups: Capoques - Cocos Deaguanes - Cujanes Quevenes - Copanes Guaycones - Guapites Camones - Karankaguases ?
