Dahmer murdered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991, with the majority of the murders occurring between 1987 and 1991. His murders involved rape, dismemberment, necrophilia and cannibalism. On November 28, 1994, he was beaten to death by an inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution, where he had been incarcerated. [ Early life ] Dahmer was born in West Allis, Wisconsin, the son of Joyce Annette (née Flint) and Lionel Herbert Dahmer, an analytical chemist. [ JEFFREY DAHMER Beacon Journal November 29, 1994 http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product%3DAK%26amp%3Bs_site%3Dohio%26amp%3Bp_multi%3DAK%26amp%3Bp_theme%3Drealcities%26amp%3Bp_action%3Dsearch%26amp%3Bp_maxdocs%3D200%26amp%3Bp_topdoc%3D1%26amp%3Bp_text_direct-0%3D0EB63121D18F8CA5%26amp%3Bp_field_direct-0%3Ddocument_id%26amp%3Bp_perpage%3D10%26amp%3Bp_sort%3DYMD_date%3AD%26amp%3Bs_trackval%3DGooglePM May 25, 2010 ] Seven years later, his brother David was born. [ Dahmer 1994 61 ] Joyce Dahmer reportedly had a difficult pregnancy with her elder son. When Jeffrey was eight years old, he moved with his family to Bath, Ohio. Dahmer grew increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative between the ages of 10 and 15, showing little interest in any hobbies or social interactions. [ Dahmer 1994 76–79 ] He biked around his neighborhood looking for dead animals, which he dissected at home (or in the woods near his home). In one instance, he went so far as to put a dog&apos;s head on a stake. [ Dahmer 1994 80 ] Dahmer began drinking in his teens and was an alcoholic by the time of his high school graduation. [ Dahmer 1994 82 ] In 1977, Lionel and Joyce Dahmer divorced. [ Dahmer 1994 90 ] Dahmer attended The Ohio State University, but dropped out after one quarter, having failed to attend most of his classes. [ Dahmer 1994 103–104 ] He was drunk for the majority of the term. [ Dahmer 1994 105 ] Dahmer&apos;s father then forced him to enlist in the Army. [ Dahmer 1994 107 ] Dahmer did well at first, [ Dahmer 1994 108–109 ] but he was discharged after two years because of his alcoholism. [ Dahmer 1994 110–111 ] When the Army discharged Dahmer in 1981, he was provided with a plane ticket to anywhere in the country. Dahmer later told police he could not go home to face his father, so he headed to Miami Beach, Florida, because he was &quot; tired of the cold &quot;. He spent most of his time there at a hospital, but was soon kicked out for drinking. After coming home, he continued to drink heavily, and he was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct later in 1981. [ Dahmer 1994 114 ] In 1982, Dahmer moved in with his grandmother in West Allis, [ Dahmer 1994 115 ] where he lived for six years. [ Dahmer 1994 117 ] During this time, his behavior grew increasingly strange. His grandmother once found a fully dressed male mannequin in his closet; Dahmer had stolen it from a store. [ Dahmer 1994 119–120 ] On another occasion, she found a.357 Magnum under his bed. [ Dahmer 1994 122–123 ] Terrible smells came from the basement; Dahmer told his father that he had brought home a dead squirrel and dissolved it with chemicals. [ Dahmer 1994 124–126 ] He was arrested twice for indecent exposure, in 1982 and 1986; [ Dahmer 1994 131 ] in his second offense, he masturbated in front of two boys. In summer 1988, Dahmer&apos;s grandmother asked him to move out because of his late nights, his strange behavior, and the foul smells from the basement. He then found an apartment on Milwaukee &apos;s West side, closer to his job at the Ambrosia Chocolate Factory. [ Dahmer 1994 132 ] On September 26, 1988, one day after moving into his apartment, he was arrested for drugging and sexually fondling a 13-year-old boy in Milwaukee named Somsack Sinthasomphone. [ Dahmer 1994 133–135 ] He was sentenced to five years probation and one year in a work release camp. He was required to register as a sex offender. [ Dahmer 1994 138 ] Dahmer was paroled from the work release camp two months early, and he soon moved into a new apartment. [ Dahmer 1994 143–144 ] Shortly thereafter, he began a string of murders that ended with his arrest in 1991. [ Murders ] Jeffrey Dahmer committed his first murder in the summer of 1978, at the age of 18. His father was away on business and his mother had moved out, taking his brother with her; Dahmer was left behind, alone. That June, Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Stephen Hicks and offered to drink beer with him back at his father&apos;s house, planning to eventually have sex with him. When Hicks tried to leave, Dahmer bludgeoned Hicks to death with a 10  lb. dumbbell, striking the back of his head, later saying he had committed the crime because &quot; the guy wanted to leave and [he] didn&apos;t want him to &quot;. [ Purcell Catherine E. A. Arrigo, Bruce The Psychology of Lust Murder: Paraphilia, Sexual Killing, and Serial Homicide Academic Press 2006 77 5 0-12-370510-X http://books.google.ca/books?id%3DagmkfIgbQxUC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA77%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA77%26amp%3Bdq%3DJeffery%2BDahmer%2Bhicks%26amp%3Bsource%3Dbl%26amp%3Bots%3DymRSt4IgrO%26amp%3Bsig%3DIi6-iUCiSsMv8xSyTk3xhNY2Jg8%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bei%3D_yI5SoOuLo7qsQPc6aX-Bg%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Boi%3Dbook_result%26amp%3Bct%3Dresult%26amp%3Bresnum%3D4 ] Dahmer buried the body in the backyard. { Roy, Jody M. Love to Hate NY: Columbia Univ. Press, 2002; pp. 102 et seq. } Nine years passed before he killed again; in September 1987, Dahmer picked up 26-year-old Steven Tuomi at a bar and killed him on impulse; he later said he had no memory of committing the crime. After the Tuomi murder, Dahmer continued to kill sporadically: two more murders in 1988, and another in early 1989, usually picking up his victims in gay bar s and having sex with them before killing them. { Roy, Jody M. Love to Hate NY: Columbia Univ. Press, 2002; pp. 103 et seq. } He kept the skull of one of his victims, Anthony Sears, until he was caught. In May 1990, he moved out of his grandmother&apos;s house for the last time and into the apartment that later became infamous: Apartment 213, 924 North 25th Street, Milwaukee. Dahmer picked up the pace of his killing: four more murders before the end of 1990, two more in February and April 1991, and another in May 1991. In the early morning hours of May 27, 1991, 14-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone (the younger brother of the boy whom Dahmer had molested in 1988) was discovered on the street, wandering naked, heavily under the influence of drugs and bleeding from his rectum. Two young women from the neighborhood found the dazed boy and called 911. Dahmer chased his victim down and tried to take him away, but the women stopped him. [ Davis 1991 7 ] Dahmer told John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish, police officers dispatched to the scene, that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, and that they had an argument while drinking. Against the protests of the two women who had called 911, who recognized him from the neighborhood and insisted that he was a child and couldn&apos;t speak English, the officers turned him over to Dahmer. They later reported smelling a strange scent while inside Dahmer&apos;s apartment, but did not investigate it. The smell was the body of Tony Hughes, Dahmer&apos;s previous victim, decomposing in the bedroom. The officers did not make any attempt to verify Sinthasomphone&apos;s age, identity or locate someone who could communicate with him and failed to run a background check that would have revealed Dahmer was a convicted child molester still under probation. Later that night, Dahmer killed and dismembered Sinthasomphone, keeping his skull as a souvenir. By summer 1991, Dahmer was murdering approximately one person each week. He killed Matt Turner on June 30, Jeremiah Weinberger on July 5, Oliver Lacy on July 12, and finally Joseph Brandehoft on July 19. Dahmer got the idea that he could turn his victims into &quot; zombie s &quot; — completely submissive, eternally youthful sexual partners – and attempted to do so by drilling holes into their skulls and injecting hydrochloric acid or boiling water into the frontal lobe area of their brains with a large syringe, usually while the victim was still alive. [ Dahmer 1994 211 ] Other residents of the Oxford Apartments complex noticed terrible smells coming from Apartment 213, as well as the thumps of falling objects and the occasional buzzing of a power saw. { &quot; The Little Flat of Horrors &quot;, &apos;&apos;TIME Magazine&apos;&apos;, August 5, 1991 } Unlike many serial killers, Dahmer killed victims from a variety of racial backgrounds. [ Arrest ] On July 22, 1991, Dahmer lured another man, Tracy Edwards, into his home. According to the would-be victim, Dahmer struggled with Edwards in order to handcuff him, but ultimately failed to cuff his wrists together. [ Davis 1991 151 ] Wielding a large butcher knife, Dahmer forced Edwards into the bedroom, where Edwards saw pictures of mangled bodies on the wall and noticed the terrible smell coming from a large blue barrel. [ Davis 1991 152 ] Edwards punched Dahmer in the face, kicked him in the stomach, ran for the door and escaped. [ Davis 1991 153–154 ] Running through the streets with handcuffs still hanging from one hand, Edwards waved for help to a police car driven by Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller of the Milwaukee police department. [ Davis 1991 154 ] Edwards led police back to Dahmer&apos;s apartment, where Dahmer at first acted friendly to the officers. However, Edwards remembered that the knife Dahmer had threatened him with was in the bedroom. When one of the officers checked the bedroom, he saw the photographs of mangled bodies and called for his partner to arrest Dahmer. As one officer subdued Dahmer, the other opened the refrigerator and found a human head. Further searching of the apartment revealed three more severed heads, multiple photographs of murdered victims and human remains, severed hands and penises, and photographs of dismembered victims and human remains in his refrigerator. The story of Dahmer&apos;s arrest and the inventory in his apartment quickly gained notoriety: several corpses were stored in acid-filled vats, and implements for the construction of an altar of candles and human skulls were found in his closet. Accusations soon surfaced that Dahmer had practiced necrophilia and cannibalism. Seven skulls were found in the apartment. [ Davis 1991 157 ] A human heart was found in the freezer. [ Davis 1991 158 ] [ Trial ] { Dateline NBC &apos;&apos; with } { Stone Phillips, 1994. } Jeffrey Dahmer was indicted on 17 murder charges, later reduced to 15. Dahmer was not charged in the attempted murder of Edwards. [ October 2010 ] His trial began on January 30, 1992. [ Dahmer 1994 207 ] With evidence overwhelmingly against him, Dahmer pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. [ Dahmer 1994 209–210 ] The trial lasted two weeks. [ Dahmer 1994 211 ] The court found Dahmer sane and guilty on 15 counts of murder and sentenced him to 15 life term s, { &quot; Guilty! &quot;, &apos;&apos;TIME Magazine, May 18, 1992 } totaling 957 years in prison, which was the maximum penalty available as Wisconsin does not have capital punishment. At his sentencing hearing, Dahmer expressed remorse for his actions, and said that he wished for his own death. In May of that year, Dahmer was extradited to Ohio, where he entered a plea of guilty for the murder of his first victim, Stephen Hicks. [ Dahmer 1994 241 ] [ Imprisonment and death ] Dahmer served his time at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin, where he ultimately declared himself a born-again Christian. This conversion occurred after viewing evangelical material sent to him by his father. { &quot; &apos;Creation Science&apos; Makes a Difference. &quot; CSE Ministry. October 18, 2007. archived from original } Roy Ratcliff, a local preacher from the Churches of Christ, met with Dahmer and agreed to baptize him. [ If you don&apos;t... if a person doesn&apos;t think that there is a God to be accountable to, then... then what&apos;s... what&apos;s the point of... of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges? That&apos;s how I thought anyway. I always believed the theory of evolution as truth, that we all just came from the slime. When we... when we died, you know, that was it, there is nothing, and I&apos;ve since come to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is truly God, and I believe that I, as well as everyone else, will be accountable to him. 15px 15px ] Dahmer was attacked twice in prison, the first time in July 1994. An inmate attempted to slash Dahmer&apos;s throat with a razor blade while Dahmer was returning to his cell from a church service in the prison chapel. Dahmer escaped the incident with superficial wounds. { Wisconsin Inmate help in Slaying of Dahmer. &quot; Deseret News. November 29, 1994. } While doing janitorial work in the prison gym, Dahmer and another inmate, Jesse Anderson, were severely beaten by fellow inmate Christopher Scarver with a broomstick handle on November 28, 1994. { &quot; Jeffrey Dahmer, Multiple Killer, Is Bludgeoned to Death in Prison. &quot; The New York Times. November } Dahmer died of severe head trauma while on his way to the hospital in an ambulance. Anderson died two days later from his wounds. { &quot; Dahmer Killer Charged &quot;, TIME Magazine, December 15, 1994 } [ Aftermath ] Upon learning of his death, Dahmer&apos;s mother, Joyce Flint, responded angrily to the media, &quot; Now is everybody happy? Now that he&apos;s bludgeoned to death, is that good enough for everyone? &quot; The response of the families of Dahmer&apos;s victims was mixed, although it appears most were pleased with his death. The district attorney who prosecuted Dahmer cautioned against turning Scarver into a folk hero, noting that Dahmer&apos;s death was still murder.

Plans to convert the site into a memorial garden failed to materialize. In 1994, Lionel Dahmer published a book, A Father&apos;s Story, and donated a portion of the proceeds from his book to the victims&apos; families. Most of the families showed support for Lionel Dahmer and his wife, Shari. He has retired from his career as an analytical chemist and resides with his wife in Medina County, Ohio. Lionel Dahmer is an advocate for creationism, and his wife was a member of the board of the Medina County Ohio Horseman&apos;s Council. [ http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/ Some modern scientists who have accepted the biblical account of creation Answers in Genesis ] Both continue to carry the name Dahmer and say they love Jeffrey despite his crimes. Lionel Dahmer&apos;s first wife, Joyce (Flint), died of cancer in 2000 at the age of 64. She was later buried in Atlanta, Georgia. Jeffrey&apos;s younger brother David changed his last name and lives in anonymity. Dahmer&apos;s estate was awarded to the families of 11 of his victims who had sued for damages. In 1996, Thomas Jacobson, a lawyer representing eight of the families, announced a planned auction of Dahmer&apos;s estate to raise up to $1 million, sparking controversy. { Serial killer&apos;s property set to go on the auction block. &quot; CNN.com. May 8, 1996. } { Johnson, Dirk. &quot; Bid to Auction Killer&apos;s Tools Provokes Disgust. &quot; The New York Times. May 20, 1996. } A civic group, Milwaukee Civic Pride, was quickly established in an effort to raise the funds to purchase and destroy Dahmer&apos;s possessions. The group pledged $407,225, including a $100,000 gift by Milwaukee real estate developer Joseph Zilber, for purchase of Dahmer&apos;s estate; five of the eight families represented by Jacobson agreed to the terms, and Dahmer&apos;s possessions were destroyed and buried in an undisclosed Illinois landfill. { &quot; Auction of Dahmer Items Is Apparently Off. &quot; The New York Times.

February 7, 2007. } When interviewed about Adam Walsh in the early 1990s, Dahmer repeatedly denied involvement in the crime.
