It is the largest incorporated community in the county, but is smaller than the unincorporated community of Rosebud, which is the capital of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe.

On episodes of The Price is Right, the host Bob Barker — who is 1/8 Sioux — noted that Mission was the town in which he spent his childhood while his mother worked as a teacher on the Indian reservation. Another notable resident of Mission is Neal Wanless, who won a South Dakota–record $232.1 million (annuity value; he chose the cash option) in the Powerball drawing of May 27, 2009.
