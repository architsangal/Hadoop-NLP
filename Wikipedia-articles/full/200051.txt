It was recorded at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan, during the heyday of that arena&apos;s time as an important rock concert venue. [ History ] &apos;Live&apos; Bullet became a staple of FM rock radio in Detroit. Classics such as the live version of &quot; Nutbush City Limits &quot; and the connected song rendition of &quot; Travelin&apos; Man &quot; and &quot; Beautiful Loser &quot; were among the most widely played live tracks on Detroit stations such as WWWW (quad), WRIF, and WABX. Other tracks such as &quot; Let It Rock &quot;, &quot; Turn the Page &quot;, and &quot; Get Out of Denver &quot; also received wide airplay in Detroit. The success of Seger&apos;s music at this time, however, was highly regional, with Seger still remaining quite unknown even in adjacent media markets such as Chicago. In June 1976, for example, Seger played the Pontiac Silverdome in metropolitan Detroit at a historic concert that also included Point Blank, Elvin Bishop, and Todd Rundgren. 78,000 people were in attendance and the concert lasted until nearly 1:30 a.m. The next night, Seger played before less than a thousand people in Chicago. { Campbell, Mary. &quot; Bob Seger to storm into Poplar Creek with rock poetry &quot; Chicago Sun-Times July 25, 1986. } However, it was only in the following winter that the release of his next recording, Night Moves, launched Seger into more national markets. Over time, the life-on-the-road tale &quot; Turn the Page &quot; would become the most nationally played song from &apos;Live&apos; Bullet, and a perennial favorite on album-oriented rock and classic rock stations. For Detroit fans, however, the entire Live&apos; Bullet recording captured a Detroit artist at the height of his energy and creativity, in front of a highly appreciative hometown crowd. &apos;Live&apos; Bullet also captured the wild and free spirit of rock concert s in the seventies, and has great historic value in that regard. Critic Dave Marsh called it &quot; one of the best live albums ever made. &quot; { The New Rolling Stone Record Guide. Ed. Dave Marsh and John Swenson. New York: Random House, 1983. ISBN 0-394-72107-1 } The 8-track tape version of this album has the distinction of being one of the few 8-tracks that is arranged exactly like the album, with no song breaks.

The live version of the song &quot; Katmandu &quot; was also featured as the sole Bob Seger track as part of a promotional-only compilation album issued by Capitol records entitled The Greatest Music Ever Sold, which was distributed to record stores during the 1976 holiday season as part of Capitol&apos;s &quot; Greatest Music Ever Sold &quot; campaign, promoting 15 &quot; best of &quot; albums released by the record label. &apos;Live&apos; Bullet is a live album and not a &quot; best of &quot; compilation, though several tracks were major regional hits ( &quot; Lookin&apos; Back &quot; #2 in Detroit, etc.). Many songs from the album such as &quot; Nutbush City Limits &quot;, &quot; Lookin&apos; Back &quot;, and &quot; Turn the Page &quot; became hit singles off the album, whereas their original studio versions were overlooked. &quot; Lookin Back &quot; was released as a single in 1971, but had very short lived success as it was not on an actual Seger album. It was originally performed by Seger&apos;s first band, The Bob Seger System, whereas the Live Bullet version featured The Silver Bullet Band. Two of the songs on the album are actually medleys. &quot; Bo Diddley &quot; is a medley of &quot; Bo Diddley &quot; and &quot; Who Do You Love? &quot;, while &quot; Let It Rock &quot; is a medley of &quot; Let It Rock &quot; and &quot; Little Queenie &quot; with some minor lyrical changes.
