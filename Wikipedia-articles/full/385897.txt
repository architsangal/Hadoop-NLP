[ people with similar names Kevin MacDonald (disambiguation) ] Kevin B. MacDonald (born January 24, 1944) is a professor of psychology at California State University, Long Beach, best known for his use of evolutionary psychology to support his theory that Judaism is a &quot; group evolutionary strategy. &quot; MacDonald&apos;s most controversial claim is that a suite of traits that he attributes to Jew s, including higher-than-average verbal intelligence and ethnocentricism, have eugenically evolved to enhance the ability of Jews to conspire to out-compete non-Jews for resources while undermining the power and self-confidence of the white majorities in Europe and America whom he insists Jews seek to disposess.

He went to parochial schools and played basketball in high school. He entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison and became an activist in the anti-war movement from about 1965 to 1975. During this period, he perceived the East Coast Jewish origins of the majority of the movement there ( Culture of Critique, p.  104), which motivated his interest in Jewish intellectual movements. MacDonald became a philosophy major and abandoned leftist radicalism. He embarked on a career as a Jazz pianist, but by the late 1970s had abandoned it in favour of academia. While in graduate school, he became attracted to E. O. Wilson &apos;s theory of sociobiology. [ Professional background ] MacDonald is the author of seven books on evolutionary psychology and child development and is the author or editor of over thirty academic articles in refereed journals. He received his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1966, and M.S. in biology from the University of Connecticut in 1976. He earned a Ph.D. in 1981 (Biobehavioral Sciences) from the University of Connecticut where he studied under Professor Benson E. Ginsburg, one of the founders and leaders of modern behavior genetics, as his advisor. His thesis was on the behavioral development of wolves and resulted in two publications:MacDonald, K. B., and Ginsburg, B. E. (1981). &quot; Induction of normal behavior in wolves with restricted rearing. &quot; Behavioral and Neural Biology, 33, 133-162;MacDonald, K. B. (1983). &quot; Development and stability of personality characteristics in prepubertal wolves. &quot; Journal of Comparative Psychology, 97, 99-106, 1983. He completed a post-doctoral fellowship with Ross Parke at the psychology department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1983. His work there concerned rough and tumble play in children (he had two small boys at home at the time as well) and resulted in three publications: MacDonald, K. B., &amp; Parke, R. D. (1984). &quot; Bridging the gap: Parent-child play interactions and peer interactive competence. &quot; Child Development, 55, 1265-1277; MacDonald, K. B., &amp; Parke, R. D.

(1987). &quot; Parent-child physical play with rejected, neglected and popular boys. &quot; Developmental Psychology, 23, 705-711. He served as Secretary-Archivist of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society and was elected as a member of the executive board from 1995 to 2001. He was an editor of Population and Environment and is an associate editor of the journal Sexuality &amp; Culture. He serves on the Advisory Board of The Occidental Quarterly, a journal that has been described by Max Blumenthal on the website of liberal magazine The American Prospect as &quot; the premier voice of the white-nationalist movement &quot;, { Max Blumenthal: White Noise. He has since become the editor of its blog. The American Prospect. August 31, 2004. Retrieved on 2007-09-04. } and makes occasional contributions to VDARE.com, an immigration reduction ist webzine. Peter Brimelow of VDARE denies it being a white nationalist webzine, but acknowledges having white nationalist writers amongst its contributors. { Peter Brimelow: &quot; Is VDARE.COM &apos;White Nationalist&apos;? &quot;. VDARE.com. July 24, 2006. Retrieved on 2007-09-04. } Brimelow does not list MacDonald as one of these. He has been with the Department of Psychology at California State University-Long Beach since 1985 and as a full professor since 1995. [ Theory of Judaism as a &quot; Group Evolutionary Strategy &quot; ] thumb [ The Culture of Critique series ] MacDonald is best known for his trilogy that analyzes Judaism and Jewish culture from the perspective of evolutionary psychology, comprising A People That Shall Dwell Alone (1994), Separation and Its Discontents (1998), and The Culture of Critique (1998). He proposes that Judaism is a group evolutionary strategy to enhance the ability of Jew s to out-compete non-Jews for resources. Using the term Jewish ethnocentrism, he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald repeatedly emphasizes that he does not argue that all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies; for example, his Understanding Jewish Influence argues that neoconservatism is a Jewish intellectual movement, while in the 2000 US Presidential Election about 80% of the Jewish vote went to Vice President Al Gore, who was campaigning against George W. Bush whose campaign was heavily staffed with and influenced by neoconservatives. [ On Jews and immigration policies ] MacDonald says that &quot; the organized Jewish community &quot; has been the single most important and powerful group in favor of unrestricted immigration to the United States, and that the community has been acting in its &quot; own perceived collective interests, &quot; regardless of whether these are in conflict with the interests of other Americans. { Kevin MacDonald: &quot; Was the 1924 Immigration Cut-off &apos;Racist&apos;? &quot;. VDARE.com. June 19, 2004. Retrieved on 2007-09-04. } MacDonald&apos;s main thesis centers on the period preceding the 1965 Immigration Act when strict, country-of-origin based quotas existed, mostly favoring immigration from Europe. According to MacDonald, while most of the ethnic communities in that period were somewhat active in trying to affect the increase of immigration quotas from their own countries of origin (i.e., the Irish for immigration from Ireland, Greeks for immigration from Greece, etc.), only the Jewish community activists were requesting (and ultimately obtained in 1965) the dismantling of country-of-origin quotas and an increase in immigration across the board. [ March 2007 ] This policy shift benefited primarily non-European immigration and had a profound impact on the U.S. demographics in the following decades. [ March 2007 ] MacDonald says that Jews opposed immigration quotas because a diverse America was safer for Jews. [ Race, culture, and intelligence ] See also Race and intelligence Like some of his fellow contributors to VDARE, MacDonald discusses racial differences and cultural assimilation. He disagrees with some contentions of popular scientists such as Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin, Leon Kamin, Steven Rose, and Jared Diamond. [ Neoconservatism ] MacDonald published a series of three articles in The Occidental Quarterly on the alleged similarities between neoconservatism and several other influential intellectual and political movements that he claims are Jewish-dominated. He argues that &quot; Taken as a whole, neoconservatism is an excellent illustration of the key traits behind the success of Jewish activism: ethnocentrism, intelligence and wealth, psychological intensity, and aggressiveness. &quot; His general conclusions are that neoconservatism fits into a general pattern of twentieth-century Jewish intellectual and political activism. Since Leo Strauss, a philosophy professor, taught several of the putative founders of the neoconservatism movement, MacDonald concludes he is a central figure in the neoconservative movement and sees him as &quot; the quintessential rabbinical guru with devoted disciples &quot;. { Kevin MacDonald: &quot; Thinking About Neoconservatism &quot;. VDARE.com. September 18, 2003. Retrieved on 2007-09-04. } MacDonald contends that, like Freudian psychoanalysis and Marxism, neoconservatism uses arguments that appeal to non-Jews, rather than appealing explicitly to Jewish interests. MacDonald argues that non-Jewish neoconservatives like Jeane Kirkpatrick and Donald Rumsfeld are examples of an ability to recruit prominent non-Jews while nevertheless preserving a Jewish core and an intense commitment to Jewish interests: &quot; it makes excellent psychological sense to have the spokespeople for any movement resemble the people they are trying to convince. &quot; He considers it significant that neoconservatism&apos;s supposed commitment to mass immigration is uncharacteristic of past conservative thought and is identical to liberal Jewish opinion.

Masters. { Politics and Life Sciences, 15, 355-358, 1996 } However, a number of other responses, especially after publication of the second and third books of MacDonald&apos;s trilogy, were more negative. MacDonald has been accused of employing scapegoating techniques that resemble classical Nazism.

(Jul. – Oct., 1995), pp. 198 –201. } Eugen Schoenfeld states the book contains &quot; sloppy scholarship &quot; and that MacDonald&apos;s comparison of Jewish collectivism during the biblical period with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English individualism &quot; indicates a total ignorance of the impact of industrialization on Western societies. &quot; { Eugen Schoenfeld. &quot; Review: A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy by Kevin MacDonald. &quot; Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion.

Spring 2007. } The SPLC also criticized MacDonald for publishing in, and receiving a 10,000 dollar grant from, the &quot; white supremacist &quot; publication The Occidental Quarterly. MacDonald is now a member of the publication&apos;s Editorial Advisory Board as well as the main contributor to its website and editor of its blog. In October 2004, he accepted the Jack London Literary Prize from The Occidental Quarterly, using the award ceremony as an occasion to argue for the need for a &quot; white ethnostate &quot; to maintain high racial birthrates. In his acceptance speech, he stated, &quot; The best way to preserve ethnic interests is to defend an ethnostate —a nation that is explicitly intended to preserve the ethnic interests of its citizens. &quot; According to MacDonald, one of the functions of such a state would be to exclude non-European immigrants who are attracted to the state by its wealth and prosperity. At the conclusion of his speech, he remarked: The alternative faced by Europeans throughout the Western world is to place themselves in a position of enormous vulnerability in which their destinies will be determined by other peoples, many of whom hold deep historically conditioned hatreds toward them. Europeans&apos; promotion of their own displacement is the ultimate foolishness —an historical mistake of catastrophic proportions.

Max Blumenthal writes that MacDonald has an extensive following among white nationalists and neo-Nazis. { Max Blumenthal. &quot; Republicanizing the Race Card. &quot; The Nation, March 23, 2006: &quot; The journal contained Long Beach State University evolutionary psychology professor Kevin MacDonald&apos;s article &apos;Understanding Jewish Influence: A Study in Ethnic Activism&apos;, which contends that Jews have special psychological traits that allow them to out-compete white Gentiles for resources and power.

In 2005, Kelso told The Occidental Report that he was meeting up with MacDonald to conduct business. MacDonald is also featured in the Stormfront member Brian Jost&apos;s anti-immigration film The Line in the Sand, where he &quot; blam[ed] Jews for destroying America by supporting immigration from developing countries. &quot; Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center told the Los Angeles Times, &quot; Not since Hitler &apos;s Mein Kampf have anti-Semites had such a comprehensive reference guide to what&apos;s &apos;wrong with Jews.&apos; His work is widely advertised and touted on white supremacist websites and sold by neo-Nazi outfits like National Vanguard Books, which considers them &apos;the most important books of the last 100 years. In January 2010, MacDonald began acting as director of the newly-founded political party American Third Position, which declares America a white Christian nation and advocates for limiting &quot; non-white &quot; immigration into the United States. A statement on their website reads, &quot; If current demographic trends persist, European-Americans will become a minority in America in only a few decades time. The American Third Position will not allow this to happen. To safeguard our identity and culture, and to secure an American future for our people, we will immediately put an indefinite moratorium on all immigration. &quot; { Butler, Kevin (January 5, 2010). &quot; Controversial CSULB professor MacDonald is director of new political party &quot;, Long Beach Press-Telegram. Retrieved on January 6, 2010. } James Edwards, who has interviewed MacDonald on his radio show The Political Cesspool, serves on the American Third Position Party&apos;s Board of Directors. [ CSULB comments ] MacDonald has been highly critical of the SPLC&apos;s investigation of him, including the November 2006 visit to his university&apos;s campus by the SPLC&apos;s Beirich. Shortly after the visit, the University issued a statement supporting MacDonald&apos;s academic freedom. Beirich acknowledges that the University supports MacDonald &quot; unequivocally &quot;. In reply to Beirich, University spokeswoman Toni Beron replied, &quot; The university will support MacDonald&apos;s academic freedom and freedom of speech. &quot; In response to this controversy, MacDonald was initially pressured to post a disclaimer on his website stating &quot; nothing on this website should be interpreted to suggest that I condone white racial superiority, genocide, Nazism, or Holocaust denial. I advocate none of these and strongly dissociate myself and my work from groups that do. Nor should my opinions be used to support discrimination against Jews or any other group. &quot; { SPLCenter.org: Promoting Hate } He has since removed that disclaimer. In addition, the Psychology Department on December 4, and 6th, issued three statements: a &quot; Statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility in Research &quot;, { Psychology Faculty Position Announcements } a &quot; Statement on Diversity &quot;, { Psychology Faculty Position Announcements } and a &quot; Statement on Misuse of Psychologists&apos; Work &quot;. { Psychology Faculty Position Announcements } Toni Beron, a spokeswoman for CSULB, said that at least two classes a year taught by all professors—including MacDonald—have student evaluations, and that some of the questions on those evaluations are open-ended, allowing students to raise any issue. &quot; Nothing has come through &quot; to suggest bias in class, she said. &quot; We don&apos;t see it. &quot; { Professor of Hate? :: Inside Higher Ed. } Jonathan Knight, who handles academic freedom issues for the American Association of University Professors said that if there are no indications that MacDonald shares his views in class, &quot; I don&apos;t see a basis for an investigation &quot; into what goes on in his courses. [ Responses to MacDonald&apos;s critics ] [ Overall ] MacDonald has written that his critics have not judged his work on its merits, but instead believe &quot; the subject is taboo and discussing it should be forbidden. &quot; { &quot; Heidi Does Long Beach: The SPLC vs. Academic Freedom &quot;. November 14, 2006. VDARE.com. } &lt; /blockquote &gt; Similarly, Frank Salter { p. 801 } has argued that much criticism of MacDonald is rooted in &quot; ignorance of his scholarship and a confounding of political and scientific issues. &quot; [ Southern Poverty Law Center ] MacDonald says on his website that he has been the target of a campaign against him by the Southern Poverty Law Center, { kevinmacdonald.net: &quot; Campaign Against Me by the Southern Poverty Law Center &quot;. Retrieved 2008-04-05. } and others. MacDonald holds, among other complaints, that the SPLC&apos;s publicity on MacDonald such as &quot; The Thirteen Scariest People in America &quot; { AlterNet: The Thirteen Scariest People in America } and &quot; Promoting Hate —California Professor is Font of Anti-Semitism, &quot; { SPLCenter.org: Promoting Hate } contain severe misrepresentations and distortions of his work. Heidi Beirich, the author of the reports, had traveled to California State University–Long Beach to interview students, faculty, and administrators about MacDonald. Among the claims MacDonald takes issue with is Beirich&apos;s claim in her report for the SPLC that he &quot; suggest[s] that colleges restrict Jewish admission and Jews be heavily taxed &apos;to counter the Jewish advantage in the possession of wealth. In his rebuttal, MacDonald reproduces the full passage as follows: Moreover, achieving parity between Jews and other ethnic groups would entail a high level of discrimination against individual Jews for admission to universities or access to employment opportunities and even entail a large taxation on Jews to counter the Jewish advantage in the possession of wealth, since at present Jews are vastly overrepresented among the wealthy and the successful in the United States. MacDonald claims that he was simply discussing a hypothetical ethnic spoils system. He writes, &quot; There is a big difference between advocating something and discussing this as a grim likelihood. I am discussing the possible consequences of a hypothetical ethnicity-based spoils system. &quot; Beirich also claimed that MacDonald blames the deaths of &quot; millions of people &quot; on &quot; the failure of Jewish assimilation into European societies. &quot; In his rebuttal, MacDonald argues that he is contending that inter-group competition is at the root of anti-Semitism and bloody conflicts between Jews and non-Jews throughout history: &quot; I think that my critics essentially want me to assert that Jewish behavior is utterly irrelevant to anti-Semitism, and I cannot accept that point of view. I am hardly alone in supposing that Jewish behavior —very often Jewish success —must be taken into account in any adequate theory of anti-Semitism. &quot; MacDonald summarized what he considered the prospect of a fair representation by the SPLC&apos;s Beirich: &quot; Given Ms Beirich&apos;s poor record in accurately portraying my writings, I had no confidence that she would conduct and report on an interview with me in a non-biased way. Nevertheless, I offered to be interviewed by her if she would answer my concerns about her previous writing about me. She has not responded to this offer. &quot; MacDonald specifically names six points he demands Beirich address before he offers her an interview, in a series of emails between himself and her, published on his website. [ CSULB dissociates from MacDonald&apos;s views ] In late 2007 the Cal State Long Beach Psychology Department began the process of formally dissociating itself from MacDonald&apos;s views on Judaism, which in some cases are &quot; used by publications considered to publicize neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology. &quot; The department&apos;s move to dissociate followed a discussion of MacDonald&apos;s December forum presentation at meeting of the department&apos;s advisory committee that concerned his ethics and methodologies. Late in 2006, a report issued by the Southern Poverty Law Center after an on-campus investigation labeled his work antisemitic and neo-Nazi propaganda, and described increasing concern about Macdonald&apos;s views by CSULB faculty members (see above). In an e-mail sent to the college&apos;s Daily Forty-Niner newspaper, MacDonald noted that he had already pledged not to teach about race differences in intelligence as a requirement for teaching his psychology class, and expressed that he was &quot; not happy &quot; about the dissociation. The newspaper also reported that in the e-mail, MacDonald confirmed that his books contained what the paper described as &quot; his claims that the Jewish race was having a negative effect on Western civilization. &quot; In an April 28, 2008 statement, the CSULB anthropology department noted that it had no wish to interfere with MacDonald&apos;s First Amendment rights. However, it noted in the statement that &quot; we have the right, if not the obligation, to denounce his writings on race, ethnicity and intelligence that promote intolerance, as not only inaccurate, but as professionally irresponsible and morally untenable. &quot; { Brad A.
