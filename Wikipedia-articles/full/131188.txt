[ West View Park ] From 1906 to 1977, West View was home to one of the most remembered Pittsburgh amusement parks, West View Park. Located in the neighborhood&apos;s valley on Perry Highway/U.S. 19, this one-midway trolley park featured two beloved roller coaster s : The Dips, with its unique banked turn-around curve, and the Racing Whippet, which featured two coasters on a strategically placed single track so that the train that started on the left of the loading platform came back on the right side and vice-versa. Another popular park attraction was &quot; Danceland &quot;, an entertainment hall that featured many performers from big band to rock and roll over the years, most notably The Rolling Stones in 1964. Danceland burned to the ground in 1973 and was not rebuilt. West View Park closed at the end of the 1977 season. Its competing amusement park, Kennywood, was continuously expanding with bigger attractions, which West View was unable to do because of its location. Today, West View Park Shopping Center (with a unique sign featuring a roller coaster resembling the Dips), occupies the amusement park site. The shopping center opened in 1981. There are no traces of the park left, but several nearby businesses feature old memorabilia (such as signs, photos, and tickets).The Wendy&apos;s fast-food restaurant in the West View Plaza was just remodeled, and there are several new pictures that are on their walls that show the old Park.
