It became independent from New Zealand in 1962. The two main islands of Samoa are Upolu and one of the biggest islands in Polynesia, Savai&apos;i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu. Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976. [ List of Member States: S http://www.un.org/members/list.shtml United Nations 27 November 2007 ] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, was called Navigators Islands by European explorers before the 20th century because of the Samoans&apos; seafaring skills.

Leach Journal of the Polynesian Society 98 3 1989 319–330 30 January 2011 ] The origins of the Samoans is closely linked to modern research about Polynesia in various scientific disciplines such as genetics, linguistics and anthropology. Scientific research is ongoing although a number of different theories exist; including one proposing that the Samoans originated from Austronesian predecessors during the terminal eastward Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia and Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE. { The Political Economy of Ancient Samoa: Basalt Adze Production and Linkages to Social Status” (Winterhoff 2007) } The Samoan origins are currently being reassessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards. Intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained between the eastern Lapita colonies and the archaeological record supports oral tradition and native genealogies that indicate inter-island voyaging and intermarriage between prehistoric Samoans, Fijians, and Tongans. { Samoa &apos;ava ceremony c. 1911. } Interior of Samoan house, Apia, Urville 1842. Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century. Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first known European to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by a French explorer by the name of Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), the man who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when English missionaries and traders began arriving. Mission work in Samoa had begun in late 1830 by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali&apos;i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti. [ Watson R.M.

(1830.1839) 1919 Chapter III http://www.samoa.co.uk/books/history-of-samoa/history-of-samoa-3.html true ] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike, as violent altercations had occurred between natives and French, British, German and American forces, who, by the late nineteenth century, valued Samoa as a refueling station for coal-fired shipping and whaling. According to Barbara A. West, &quot; The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a ritual of war in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus proving his bravery. &quot; { Barbara A. West (2008). &quot; Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania &quot;. Infobase Publishing. p.704.

Britain also sent troops to protect British business enterprise, harbour rights, and consulate office. There followed an eight-year civil war, where each of the three powers supplied arms, training, and in some cases, combat troops to the warring Samoan parties. The Samoan crisis came to a critical juncture in March 1889 when all three colonial contenders sent warships into Apia harbour, and a larger-scale war seemed imminent, until a massive storm on the 15th March 1889 damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict. [ Stevenson, Robert Louis A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa 1892 BiblioBazaar 1-4264-0754-8 ] The Second Samoan Civil War was a conflict that reached a head in 1898 when Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States were locked in dispute over who should have control over the Samoa Islands. The Siege of Apia occurred during the Second Samoan Civil War in March 1899 at Apia. Samoan forces loyal to Prince Tanu were besieged by a larger force of Samoan rebels loyal to Mata&apos;afa Iosefo. Supporting Prince Tanu were landing parties from four British and American warships. Over the course of several days of fighting, the Samoan rebels were defeated. { Mains, P. John; McCarty, Louis Philippe (1906). The Statistician and Economist: Volume 23. pg. 249 } American and British warships shelled Apia on March 15, 1899; including the USS &apos;&apos;Philadelphia&apos;&apos;. Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States quickly resolved to end the hostilities; with the partitioning of the island chain at the Tripartite Convention of 1899. { Ryden, George Herbert. The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa. New York: Octagon Books, 1975. (Reprint by special arrangement with Yale University Press. Originally published at New Haven: Yale University Press, 1928), p. 574; the Tripartite Convention (United States, Germany, Great Britain) was signed at Washington on 2 December 1899 with ratifications exchanged on 16 February 1900 } [ 20th century ] The Tripartite Convention of 1899 partitioned the Samoan Islands into two parts: the eastern island group became a territory of the United States (the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu&apos;a in 1904) and is today known as American Samoa; the western islands, by far the greater landmass, became known as German Samoa after Britain vacated all claims to Samoa and accepted termination of German rights in Tonga and certain areas in the Solomon Islands and West Africa. { Ryden, p. 571 } By 1912 the German administration had apparently achieved its long-term objective of understanding the traditional forces in Samoa politics while maintaining a semblance of local participation in government. There was no more Tupu (King), nor even alii sili (similar to a governor), but the two Fautua (Advisors) were appointed. Tumua and Pule (traditional governments of Upolu and Savaii) were for a time silent; all decisions on matters affecting lands and titles were under the control of the Governor. To complete the process, the Fa’alupega for all Samoa was revised. In a culture based on oratory, the Fa’alupega is a formal greeting which acknowledges those being greeted and their status. The Fa’alupega, which had been nationally accepted from at least the late 19th century (and probably for much longer than that), was as follows: &quot; Tulouna a Tumua ma Pule, Tulouna a Itu’au ma Alataua, Tulouna a Aiga-i-le-Tai, Ma le Va’a-o-Fonoti, Tulouna a Tama ma a latou aiga Po’o aiga ma a latou tama &quot;. This firstly recognized the authority and identity of principal districts of Samoa through their spokesmen – Tumua ma Pule, Itu’au ma Alataua, Aiga-i-le-Tai, and the Va&apos;a-o-Fonoti – and the highest titles which were bestowed by these groups. It concludes with the recognition of the great maximal descent groups of Samoa and their “sons” who had been chosen to hold the highest titles. The new Fa’alupega of German Samoa, which in its first line recognises the Kaiser (Kaisa), apparently required Malietoa Tanunafili and Tupua Tamasese to be sworn on oath to become advisors to the governing council: &quot; Tulouna a lana Maiesitete le Kaisa o le tupu mamalu o lo tatou malo kasialika aoao. Tulouna a lana afioga le kovana kasialika o le sui o le kaisa I Samoa nei. Susu mai Malietoa, Afio mai Tupua Ua fa’amanatuiana ai aiga e lua I o oulua tofiga Kasialika o le Fautua. Tulouna a le vasega a Faipule Kasialika o e lagolago malosi I le Malo. Afifio mai le nofo a vasega o tofiga Kasialika o e usu fita I le tautua I le malo &quot;. The first German Governor, Wilhelm Solf, later went on to become Secretary for the Colonies of Imperial Germany. New Zealand troops landed on &apos;Upolu unopposed on 29 August 1914 and seized control from the German authorities, following a request by Britain for New Zealand to perform their &quot; great and urgent imperial service. &quot; [ New Zealand goes to war: The Capture of German Samoa http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/new-zealand-goes-to-war-first-world-war nzhistory.net.nz 27 November 2007 ] Exiled orator Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe From the end of World War I until 1962, New Zealand controlled Samoa as a Class C Mandate under trusteeship through the League of Nations.

The second major incident arose out of an initially peaceful protest by the Mau (which literally translates as &quot; strongly held opinion &quot; ), a non-violent popular movement which had its beginnings in the early 1900s on Savai&apos;i, led by Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe, an orator chief deposed by Solf. In 1909, Lauaki was exiled to Saipan and died en route back to Samoa in 1915. By 1918, Samoa had population of some 38,000 Samoans and 1,500 Europeans.

Within the ecoregion about 28% of plants and 84% of land birds are endemic. { WWF: &apos;&apos;Samoan tropical moist forests&apos;&apos;, retrieved 30 December 2011 } [ Economy ] [ Economy of Samoa ] { Savaii. } Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2006 was estimated at $1.218 billion USD. [ May 2008 ] The industrial sector is the largest component of GDP at 58.4%, followed by the services sector at 30.2% (2004 est.). Agriculture represents only 11.4% of GDP (2004 est.). Samoan labor force is estimated at 90,000. [ May 2008 ] The country currency is the Samoan tālā, issued and regulated by the Central Bank of Samoa. [ http://www.cbs.gov.ws/about/intro/index.html Introduction Central Bank of Samoa website 18 November 2010 ] The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on agriculture and fishing at the local level. In modern times, development aid, private family remittances from overseas, and agricultural exports have become key factors in the nation&apos;s economy. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labour force, and furnishes 90% of export s, featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, noni (juice of the nonu fruit, as it is known in Samoan), and copra. [ Samoa: Economy https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ws.html#Econ CIA World Factbook 26 November 2007 ] Outside of a large automotive wire harness factory ( Yazaki Corporation ), the manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. Tourism is an expanding sector which now accounts for 25% of GDP. Tourist arrivals have been increasing over the years with more than 100,000 tourists visiting the islands in 2005, up from 70,000 in 1996. The Samoan government has called for deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline. [ October 2008 ] Observers point to the flexibility of the labour market as a basic strength for future economic advances. [ October 2008 ] The sector has been helped enormously by major capital investment in hotel infrastructure, political instability in neighboring Pacific countries, and the 2005 launch of Virgin Samoa a joint-venture between the government and Virgin Australia (then Virgin Blue). { Taro, a root crop, traditionally was Samoa&apos;s largest export, generating more than half of all export revenue in 1993. But a fungal blight decimated the plants, and in each year since 1994 taro exports have accounted for less than 1% of export revenue. } In the period before German colonization, Samoa produced mostly copra. German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale plantation operations and developing new industries, notably cocoa bean and rubber, relying on imported labourers from China and Melanesia. When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of banana s, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. [ October 2008 ] Because of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interests. Of the total land area of 2,934  km² (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable. About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC). [ July 2008 ] The staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), cocoa bean (for chocolate), and banana s. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the rhinoceros beetle in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are Criollo -Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy. [ October 2008 ] Other agricultural industries have been less successful. Sugarcane production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of Apia. Pineapple s grow well in Samoa, but beyond local consumption have not been a major export. [ Demographics ] A Samoan family. [ Demographics of Samoa ] Samoa has a population of 182,265 of which 92.6% are Samoans, 7% Euronesian s (people of mixed, European and Polynesian ancestors) and 0.4% are Europeans, per the CIA World Factbook. About three-quarters of the population live on the main island of Upolu. Only the Māori of New Zealand outnumber Samoans among Polynesian groups. Samoans&apos; religious adherence includes the following: Christian Congregational Church of Samoa 35.5%, Roman Catholic 19.6%, Methodist 15%, Latter-day Saint s 12.7%, Samoan Assemblies of God 10.6%, Seventh-day Adventist 3.5%, Worship Centre 1.3%, unspecified 0.8% (2001 census). [ Samoa: People; Religions https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ws.html#People CIA World Factbook 26 November 2007 ] The Head of State until 2007, His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II, was a Bahá&apos;í convert. Samoa hosts one of seven Bahá&apos;í Houses of Worship in the world; completed in 1984 and dedicated by the Head of State, it is located in Tiapapata, 8  km (5  mi) from Apia. [ Culture ] Roman Catholic cathedral Immaculate Conception of Mary, now demolished. A Samoan fire dancer. [ Culture of Samoa ] [ Music of Samoa ] The fa&apos;a Samoa, or traditional Samoan way, remains a strong force in Samoan life and politics. Despite centuries of European influence, Samoa maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and language. Cultural customs such as the Samoa &apos;ava ceremony are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of matai chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven &apos;ie toga. Samoan mythology includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as Tagaloa and the goddess of war Nafanua, the daughter of Saveasi&apos;uleo, ruler of the spirit realm Pulotu. Other legends include the well known story of Sina and the Eel which explains the origins of the first coconut tree. Some Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to &apos;fit in&apos; with fa&apos;a Samoa and vice versa. As such, ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side-by-side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa&apos;a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centered around the principle of vāfealoa&apos;i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or fa&apos;aaloalo. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian. The other 2 percent either identify themselves as irreligious, or do not belong to any congregation. Some Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan fale (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather. The Samoan word for dance is siva with unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and which tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more physical and snappy. [ Dance: Siva http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html Samoa.co.uk 26 November 2007 ] The sasa is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid synchronised movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ( pate ) or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the fa&apos;ataupati or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. This is believed to have been derived from slapping insect s on the body. The form and construction of traditional architecture of Samoa was a specialised skill by Tufuga fai fale that was also linked to other cultural artforms. [ Tattooing ] { Pe&apos;a, a male Samoan tattoo. } { malu. } As with other Polynesian cultures ( Hawai&apos;ian, Tahitian and Māori ) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos. For males, it is called the Pe&apos;a and consists of intricate and geometrical patterns tattoo ed that cover areas from the knees up towards the ribs. A male who possesses such a tatau is called a soga&apos;imiti. A Samoan girl or teine is given a malu, which covers the area from just below her knees to her upper thighs.

Her first book of poetry Wild Dogs Under My Skirt was published by Victoria University Press in 2004. International influences like hip hop impact on Samoan culture. According to Katerina Martina Teaiwa, PhD from the University of Hawai&apos;i at Manoa, &quot; Hip hop culture in particular is popular amongst Samoan youth. &quot; { Dances of Life | American Samoa } [ June 2010 ] This is not surprising considering the large amounts of migration between Samoa, Hawaii, and the United States mainland, specifically California. In addition, the integration of hip hop elements into Samoan tradition also &quot; testifies to the transferability of the dance forms themselves, &quot; and to the &quot; circuits through which people and all their embodied knowledge travel. &quot; { Henderson, April K. “Dancing Between Islands: Hip Hop and the Samoan Diaspora.” In The Vinyl Ain’t Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 180-199. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press, 2000 } Dance both in its traditional form and its more modern forms has remained a central cultural currency to Samoans, especially youths. [ Sport ] [ Sport in Samoa ] Samoa (blue) vs. South Africa in June 2007. The main sports played in Samoa are rugby union, Samoan cricket and netball. Rugby union is the national football code of Samoa. In Samoan villages, volleyball is also popular. Rugby union is the national sport in Samoa and the national team, nicknamed the Manu Samoa, is consistently competitive against teams from vastly more populous nations. Samoa has competed at every Rugby World Cup since 1991, and made the quarter finals in 1991, 1995 and the second round of the 1999 world cup. [ Rugby in Samoa http://www.manusamoa.net/history.htm ManuSamoa.net 26 November 2007 ] At the 2003 world cup, Manu Samoa came close to beating eventual world champions, England. Samoa also played in the Pacific Nations Cup and the Pacific Tri-Nations The sport is governed by the Samoa Rugby Football Union, who are members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance, and thus, also contribute to the international Pacific Islanders rugby union team. At club level there is the National Provincial Championship and Pacific Rugby Cup Prominent Samoan players include Pat Lam and Brian Lima. In addition many Samoans have played for or are playing for the New Zealand All Blacks. They also took home the cup at Wellington and the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in 2007—for which the Prime Minister of Samoa, also Chairman of the national rugby union, Tuila’epa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi, declared a national holiday. They also were the IRB World Sevens Series Champions in 2010 capping a year of achievement for the Samoans, following wins in the USA, Australia, Hong Kong and Scotland Sevens tournaments. Rugby league is mostly played by Samoans living in New Zealand and Australia, with Samoa reaching the quarter finals of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup made of players playing in the NRL and Superleague. Many Samoans and New Zealanders or Australians of Samoan descent play in the Super League and National Leagues in Britain.

American football is occasionally played in Samoa, reflecting its wide popularity in American Samoa, where the sport is played under high school sanction. About 30 ethnic Samoans, many from American Samoa, currently play in the National Football League. A 2002 article from ESPN estimated that a Samoan male (either an American Samoan, or a Samoan living in the mainland United States) is 40 times more likely to play in the NFL than a non-Samoan American.
