Operation Yoav (also called Operation Ten Plagues or Operation Yo&apos;av) was an Israel i military operation carried out from 15–22 October 1948 in the Negev Desert, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Its goal was to drive a wedge between the Egypt ian forces along the coast and the Beersheba – Hebron – Jerusalem road and ultimately to conquer the whole Negev. Operation Yoav was headed by the Southern Front commander Yigal Allon. The operation was named after Yitzhak Dubnow, codenamed &quot; Yoav &quot; by his commanders in the Palmach. Dubnow, a senior Palmach officer, was charged with planning and leading the defense of the kibbutzim Negba and Yad Mordechai. Dubnow was killed in an air raid on Kibbutz Negba shortly after Egyptian forces began their offensive on Israel&apos;s southern front. { Beersheba } [ Background ] In the central and northern parts of Palestine, the Israelis had managed to make substantial territorial gains before the second truce of the war went into effect. But the southern Negev Desert, allocated to a Jewish state in the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, was still under Egyptian control. Despite the second truce, the Egyptians denied Jewish convoys passage through to the Negev, and captured positions beyond the truce demarcation lines. Operation Ten Plagues (after the punishment God sent to the Egyptians for holding the Israelis captive in the Hebrew Bible ) was made and approved at a Cabinet Session 6 October 1948. The operation came after at 14 October 1948 when a convoy consisting of 16 trucks was fired on as it passed through Egyptian positions. Ralph Bunche, who had become UN mediator after the assassination of Count Folke Bernadotte, said: [The Israeli] military action of the last few days has been on a scale which could only be undertaken after considerable preparation, and could scarcely be explained as simple retaliatory action for an attack on a [Israeli] convoy. [ History ] The force consisted of three infantry brigades, the Negev Brigade, the Givati Brigade, and the Yiftach Brigade, an armored battalion from the 8th Armored Brigade and the largest artillery formation that had been available to the IDF at the time. On October 18 the Oded Brigade also joined in the operation. In the evening of October 15 the Israeli Air Force bombed Gaza, al-Majdal (now Ashkelon ), Beersheba and Beit Hanoun. A battalion of the Yiftach Brigade mined the railroad between El-Arish and Rafah and various roads in the Gaza area, also driving a wedge into the road. Two battalions of the Givati Brigade drove south east of Iraq al-Manshiyya, thus cutting the road between al-Faluja and Beit Jibrin. Beit Jibrin was captured by the 52 Battalion of Givati and the 8th Brigade on October 23.

Another force joined them from the north. Even though in the city proper, the Egyptian forces outnumbered the Israeli 500 to 60, they surrendered after being shelled by an anti-tank gun which was smuggled into the city at 08:00. The conquest of Beersheba was named Operation Moshe, after Moshe Albert, who fell defending the besieged Beit Eshel.

[ Israeli History: War of Independence Israeli Weapons 2007-12-06 http://www.israeli-weapons.com/history/war_of_independance/WarofIndependance.html ] According to Jewish historian Benny Morris, soldiers from the 8th Brigade carried out a massacre at al-Dawayima. { Khalidi, Walid (1991). &quot; All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948 &quot;, The Institute of Palestine Studies, Washington, D.C.

On 9 November, the Iraq Suwaydan fortress was captured and renamed the Yoav Fortress in honor of the operation. Towards the end of the operation General Allon sought permission to launch an attack on the Hebron hills and into the Jericho valley. David Ben-Gurion refused, mainly due to a tacit agreement with King Abdullah on the division of the West Bank and the need to avoid British involvement. { Peri, Yoram (1983) Between battles and ballots.
