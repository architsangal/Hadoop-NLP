It is the third-youngest and the third most active of the five volcanoes that form the island of Hawai i, following Kīlauea and the much larger Mauna Loa, and also the westernmost. Its peak is [ 8,271 ft m ] above sea level. Hualālai is estimated to have risen above sea level about 300,000  years ago. Despite maintaining a very low level of activity since its last eruption in 1801, Hualālai is still considered active, and is expected to erupt again some time within the next century. The relative unpreparedness of the residents in the area caused by the lull in activity would worsen the consequences of such an event. The volcano has been inhabited for centuries by Hawaiian natives, dating back to before recorded history. The coast west of Hualālai in particular had several royal complexes. The volcano is also important ecologically, is home to many rare species and several nature reserve s near the summit, and is a popular hiking attraction. Today the coast near Hualālai is pocketed by multiple vacation resorts, some built on historic flows, and a National historic park. [ Geology ] [ Structural features ] An expedition down a lava conduit in Hualālai volcano Hualālai stands at [ 8271 ft m 0 on ] with a prominence of [ 2473 m 0 on ]. It is the westernmost of the five major volcanoes which form the island of Hawai i. { i&apos;s Third Active Volcano } { USGS } { 18 June 2001 } Being in the post-shield stage of development, Hualālai is overall much rougher in shape and structure than the more youthful Mauna Loa and Kīlauea.

[ Rubin Ken Hualalai Volcano http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/hualalai.html Hawaiian Center for Volcanology 15 June 2010 ] { i Press } { 441 } There are over 100 cinder and spatter cones arranged along these rift zones. Hualālai has no summit caldera, although there is a collapse crater about [ 0.3 mi km on ] across atop a small lava shield. Much of the southern slope (above the modern town of Kailua-Kona ) consists of lava flows covered by a layer of volcanic ash from [ 10 to 100 cm in 0 on ] thick. [ Volcano Information: Hualalai http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/about/volcanoes/hawaii/hualalai.php USGS 16 June 2010 2 June 2008 ] In comparison with the other volcanoes of the island of Hawai i, it is the third tallest, third oldest, third most active, and second smallest, making up just 7% of the island. A major subfeature of Hualālai is Pu u Wa awa a, Hawaiian for &quot; many-furrowed hill &quot;, a volcanic cone standing [ 372 m ft 0 on ] tall and measuring over [ 1.6 km mi 0 on ] in diameter. It extends for [ 9 km 0 on ], and has a prominence of [ 275 m ft 0 on ], north of the summit at [ 19 46 15 N 155 49 56 W inline type:landmark_region:US-HI Puu Waa Waa ]. The cone is constructed of trachyte, a type of volcanic lava that exists at no other volcano on Hawai i. Trachyte flows move more slowly than the typically &quot; runny &quot; Hawaiian lavas, a characteristic caused by its high (over 62%) silicon composition (typical basalt is only 50% silicon). Geologists hypothesize that Pu u Wa awa a originally formed during a pumice eruption a little over 100,000  years ago, and has continued to build itself since then, with at least three distinct trachyte flows recognized. The eruptions, although partially covered by flows from Hualālai and Mauna Loa, have built a distinctive structure known as the Pu u Anahulu ridge. The westward-facing flank of Hualālai forms a large underwater slump known as the North Kona slump. An area of about [ 1000 km2 sqmi on ], the slump consists of an intricate formation of beaches and scarps [ 2000 to 4500 m ft -2 on ] below the waterline. This area was explored more closely in a 2001 joint Japan - USA project to explore the volcano&apos;s flanks, utilizing the Remotely operated vehicle ROV &apos;&apos;Kaikō&apos;&apos;. Data collected showed that the lava flows there originated in shallow water [ 500 to 1000 m ft -2 on ] deep, and that unlike similar slumps at other volcanoes, the slump at Hualālai formed gradually.

Many prehistoric deposits, as well as those from the 1801 event, contain xenoliths of large size and abundant quantity. [ History ] { Hawai i island; it is westernmost of the five. } Lava attributed to a shield-stage Hualālai has been found just offshore of the volcano&apos;s northwest rift zone. Tholeiitic basalt, indicative of the submarine subphase of the volcano&apos;s construction, has been found in wells driven into the volcano at a depth of [ 75 ft 0 on ]. These lavas persisted until an estimated 130,000  years ago. [ http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1089/Hawaii_expl_pamphlet.pdf Geological Map of the State of Hawaii David R. Sherrod, John M.

Pumice and trachyte eruptions at Pu u Wa awa a may be a sign of this change. [ When Hualalai Turned Viscous http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2004/04_08_12.html Volcano Watch USGS 16 June 2010 August 12, 2004 ] Geological mapping of the volcano has indicated that as much as 80% of the volcano&apos;s surface has been topped by lava flows during the last 5,000  years, entirely composed of post-shield alkalic basalt. More than half of this is under 3,000  years old, and about 12% is less than 1,000  years of age. Between the years 1700 and 1801, eruptions originated from six different vents. Two of these lava flows poured into the sea to the west coast of the dog. [ Eruptive history ] Hualālai is the third most active volcano making up the island of Hawai i, behind Kīlauea and Mauna Loa. Although the two larger volcanos have each erupted over 150  times in the last 1,000  years, Hualālai has done so but 3  times. The recurrence of activity at the volcano seems to be every 200 to 300  years. [ Lucas Carolyn Hualalai – Kona&apos;s sleeping giant http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/articles/2010/01/17/local/local01.txt West Hawaii Today 16 June 2010 January 17, 2010 ] [ May 2011 ] A recent calm period, with almost no earthquake or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain&apos;s flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano&apos;s peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, and is expected to erupt again within the next 100  years. [ Lava stratigraphy ] The USGS has divided the exposed lava flows and tephra erupted by Hualālai volcano during the last 112,000  years into 419  rock units of 8   chronostratigraphic age groups.

The two gray areas are the two major outflows from the 1800–1801 event. Hualālai last erupted in 1800–1801. This eruption produced very fluid alkalic basalt lava flows that entered the ocean off the western tip of Hawai i island. Although five vents were active at the time, only two produced flows that eventually reached the ocean. The total output volume of the flow is estimated at over [ 300,000,000 m3 cumi on ]. One volcanic vent, situated high on the slope, produced a large a&apos;a flow, dubbed the Kaʻūpūlehu flow, that reached the ocean as two distinct lobes. On its way down, it overran a village and a valuable [ 3 mi km 0 on ] fishing pond. There is a local legend that after the failure of several offerings of animals and other items to the gods, the flow was finally stopped when Kamehameha I threw a lock of his own hair into the fire. The Ka&apos;ūpūlehu flow is also known for the particularly large quantity of mafic and ultramafic xenolith s that came up with it. The other major outflow from the event reached the sea south of Kiholo Bay, destroying the village of Kaʻūpūlehu. [ Watson John Lava Flow Hazard Zone Maps:Hualalai http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hazards/hualalai.html USGS 16 June 2010 July 18, 1997 ] This 1801 flow, known as the Hu ehu e flow, formed Keahole Point where Kona International Airport is now located, [ 11 km mi on ] north of Kailua-Kona. [ McCoy Floyd Grant Heiken Volcanic hazards and disasters in human antiquity The Geological Society of America 2000 ] The eruption at Hualālai was concurrent with an eruption at the nearby Mauna Loa. It is theorized that, in the near past, Hualālai has had synchronous eruptions with both Mauna Loa and Kilauea. [ Recent activity ] Although Hualālai itself last erupted in 1800–1801, it has been indirectly involved in three events since. Pu u Wa awa a, an offshoot of Hualālai, last erupted in 1859, creating a [ 900 ft m 0 on ] thick flow, dubbed the Pu u Anahulu flow, that entered the ocean at Kiholo Bay. There was also a submarine eruption in Kealakekua Bay in 1877. In addition, a severe earthquake swarm shook the volcano in 1929, lasting about a month. This caused $100,000 worth of damage to the Kona district ($1.2 million as of 2010), and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 and 6.5 were felt as far away as Honolulu. This was probably caused by magma movement near the surface, but there was no surface activity or eruption. The 2006 Hawaii earthquake, with epicenter just to the north in Kiholo Bay near Māhukona, caused much damage in the area. [ M6.7 – Island of Hawaii, Hawaii USGS http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/events/us/2006twbh/us/index.html July 26, 2010 ] [ Future monitoring ] Although Hualālai last erupted over 200 years ago, it will almost certainly erupt again in the near future, as a 200–300  year estimated pause in activity is coming to an end. It presents a distinct hazard to the communities around it as well; for example, in the event of an eruption similar to the 1801 event, Kailua-Kona, which is [ 15 mi km on ] from the volcano&apos;s summit, could be covered completely in a matter of hours. According to the USGS Lava Flow Hazard Zones, on a scale of 1 to 9, all of Hualālai is listed as threat level 4. For comparison, almost all of Kīlauea and Mauna Loa is listed as threat levels 1 through 3. [ Watson John Lava Flow Hazard Zone Maps http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hazards/maps.html USGS 16 June 2010 December 18, 1997 ] The flanks of the volcano do not pose a lower threat to the population than the area near the rift zones because the distance is short and the slopes are steep; lava poses as much of a threat as it does near its source. Since 1971, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) has maintained a seismic recording station [ 3 km mi on ] east of Hualālai&apos;s summit to monitor the volcano. During this time, not a single earthquake swarm or harmonic tremor, indicative of activity at the volcano, has been observed. Although Hualālai does experience several magnitude 4 earthquakes per year, these are attributed to a deep source off the coast of the northwestern rift zone and are not related to the movement of magma. The USGS is currently in the process of upgrading its aging monitoring and telemetry equipment, using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds. The agency plans to add another seismometer and three more sensors to help monitor activity. In addition, the HVO uses GPS to measure slight changes in tilt and slope of Hualālai, indicative of magmatic movement. A survey has been conducted every two years since 1984, but [ 2010 on ] no changes have been recorded.
