Built by Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland, she was completed with Exocet launchers in &apos;B&apos; position. [ Falklands War service ] Arrow participated in the Falklands War, and had the dual distinction of being both the first British warship to fire on the enemy (whilst firing on land forces at Port Stanley), and the first British warship to be hit by enemy fire, after being straffed by an Argentine Air Force fighter. { Both incidents are referenced in the Guardian newspaper report of the death of the ship&apos;s commander. } On 4 May 1982 she assisted in extinguishing the fires and evacuating the crew of the Type 42 destroyer &apos;&apos;Sheffield&apos;&apos;, which had been struck by an Exocet missile. The crew showed conspicuous bravery in this rescue effort, saving 225 of the crew of HMS Sheffield, and Arrow&apos;s captain, Commander (later Captain ) Paul Bootherstone was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for gallantry during the action. { Fully referenced in Bootherstone&apos;s Daily Telegraph obituary report. } Arrow also helped extinguish the fires on the &apos;&apos;Rothesay&apos;&apos; class frigate &apos;&apos;Plymouth&apos;&apos;, on 8 June 1982. The silhouette of HMS Arrow is to be found, along with the date 1 May, painted on the side of Argentine Air Force Dassault Mirage 5 /IAI Finger serial number C-412, along with a similar silhouette representation of HMS &apos;&apos;Brilliant&apos;&apos; and the date 21 May, implying a successful action by the aircrew against these vessels. These kill markings are however overstated, and refer merely to damage which both ships suffered during the conflict, which may or may not have been caused by this particular aircraft. HMS Arrow was slightly damaged by cannon fire on 1 May 1982, and HMS Brilliant was slightly damaged by cannon fire on 21 May 1982 outside San Carlos Water. The aircraft was reportedly observed still bearing these distinguishing marks as late as November 2005 (twenty-three years after the conflict) at the multi-national Exercise Ceibo in Argentina. Arrow also supported troops of the Second Battalion the Parachute Regiment (2 Para) in the successful landing at Goose Green, which eventually led to the recapture of Port Stanley from the enemy. { Referenced in this report. } [ Later Royal Navy service ] By the mid-1980s Arrow was suffering from cracking in her hull. Much of this had first arisen during the Falklands conflict, when engineers were obliged to weld steel plates and girders to parts of the ship where cracks were opening up in the aluminium superstructure. { These facts are fully referenced, with photographs, by the wartime crew at this location. } After the war she was taken in for refitting, with a large steel plate being welded down each side of the ship. At the same time modifications were made to reduce hull noise. The vessel continued in service until 1994, and was decommissioned and removed from the fleet on 1 March that year. [ Pakistan Navy service ] Following decommissioning Arrow was transferred to Pakistan and renamed PNS Khaibar. { D-183 PNS Khaibar } The Exocet missile system was not transferred to Pakistan and Khaibar had her obsolete Sea Cat missile launcher removed. A quadruple Harpoon missile launcher was fitted in place of the Exocet launchers and a Phalanx CIWS was fitted in place of the Sea Cat launcher. SRBOC chaff launchers and 20  mm and 30  mm guns were fitted. Khaibar remains in service with the Pakistan Navy, who purchased from the United Kingdom Government all six surviving Type 21 frigates of the eight originally built (two were lost in the Falklands). { Referenced at this site. } [ References ] AirForces Monthly Magazine February 2006, page 61.
