[ Bishop of Worcester Bishop of Cornwall ] { 1027 } { 20, 23 or 25 March 1046 } { English } { Roman Catholic } { Abbot of Tavistock } Lyfing of Winchester (died March 1046), also known as Livingus or Lifing, was an Anglo-Saxon prelate who served as Bishop of Worcester, Bishop of Crediton and Bishop of Cornwall. [ Life ] His uncle was Burhweald, Bishop of Cornwall, { Lawson Cnut pp. 116–117 } according to the medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury. { King &quot; Ealdred &quot; Anglo-Norman Studies XVIII p. 124 } He was probably a monk either at Winchester Abbey { Barlow &quot; Lyfing (d. 1046) &quot; Oxford Dictionary of National Biography } or at Glastonbury Abbey. In 1009, he became Abbot of Tavistock, { Knowles Heads of Religious Houses pp. 72, 255 } and that was always his favourite of the offices he held. [ April 2008 ] In 1027, he became the Bishop of Crediton, and about the same time he became Bishop of Cornwall on the death of his uncle Brihtwold, so he united those two sees, with the seat at Crediton. { Fryde Handbook of British Chronology p. 215 } { Barlow English Church 1000–1066 p. 73 } His elevation probably was due both to his family and to his assistance to Cnut in Rome. { Lawson Cnut p. 137 } There is also some indication he may have been a protege of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. In 1038 or 1039, Lyfing also became Bishop of Worcester, but was deprived of the see in 1040. { Fryde Handbook of British Chronology p. 224 } King Harold Harefoot gave Worcester to Lyfing because of Lyfing&apos;s support of Harold. His deprivation was due to King Harthacnut &apos;s belief that Lyfing was involved in the death of Harthacnut&apos;s half brother Alfred Atheling. { Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 422-423 } Lyfing was accused by Aelfric Puttoc, the archbishop of York, who briefly replaced Lyfing at Worcester. { Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 80 } Lyfing seems to have claimed that he was merely following the orders of Harold Harefoot. { Mason House of Godwine p. 41 } However, he was restored to Worcester in 1041 and held the three sees until his death on either March 20, March 23 or March 25, 1046. Bishop Lyfing was a close friend and trusted counsellor of King Canute the Dane and accompanied him on a pilgrimage to Rome in 1027. Florence of Worcester, the medieval chronicler, claims that Lyfing, along with Godwin, was instrumental in securing the succession of Edward the Confessor to the throne of England on Harthacnut&apos;s death. { Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 86 } A tradition at Worcester also recorded that it was Lyfing, along with Archbishop Eadsige of Canterbury, who forced Sweyn to release Eadgifu, the abbess of Leominster who Sweyn had kidnapped. { Barlow Godwins p. 53 } In revenge, Sweyn raided the lands of the diocese of Worcester. { Barlow English Church 1000–1066 p. 58 } Before Lyfing&apos;s death, Aldred, who succeeded him at Worcester, had probably been acting as his suffragan or co-bishop. { Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 86 } When Lyfing died, he chose to be buried at Tavistock Abbey. Lyfing was a pluralist and never enjoyed a good reputation. However, the D version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes him as &quot; the eloquent bishop &quot;, which may imply that he was noted as an important preacher. { Lawson Cnut p. 66 } Tavistock monks also remembered him as a great benefactor to their monastery. { Barlow English Church 1000–1066 p. 74 } [ Notes ] [ 40em ] [ References ] [ 60em ] [ Barlow, Frank Frank Barlow (historian) Edward the Confessor University of California Press Berkeley 1970 0-520-01671-8 ] [ Barlow, Frank Frank Barlow (historian) The English Church 1000–1066: A History of the Later Anglo-Saxon Church Longman New York 1979 0-582-49049-9 Second Edition ] [ Barlow Frank Frank Barlow (historian) Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Lyfing (d. 1046) http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16799 2008-04-07 2004 Oxford University Press ] [ Barlow, Frank Frank Barlow (historian) The Godwins: The Rise and Fall of a Noble Dynasty Pearson/Longman London 2003 0-582-78440-9 ] [ Fryde, E.
