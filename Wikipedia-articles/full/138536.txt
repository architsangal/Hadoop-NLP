It is the county seat of Monongalia County. Placed along the banks of the Monongahela River, Morgantown is the largest city in North-Central West Virginia, and the base of the Morgantown metropolitan area. It has a permanent population of 29,660 per the 2010 census, with West Virginia University adding several thousand seasonal residents to the city and surrounding area from September through May. Morgantown is best known as the home of both West Virginia University and the one-of-a-kind Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit system. [ History ] Morgantown is closely tied to the Anglo-French struggle for this territory. Until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, what is now known as Morgantown was greatly contested among settlers and Native Americans, as well as the British and the French. The treaty decided the issue in favor of the British, but Indian fighting continued almost to the beginning of the American Revolution. Zackquill Morgan, son of Morgan Morgan, and his brother David entered the area of Virginia that would become Morgantown in about 1767, although others such as Thomas Decker are recorded as attempting settlements in the area earlier or at about the same time. As well, several forts were built in the area during this time: Fort Pierpont near the Cheat River, in 1769; Fort Coburn, near Dorsey&apos;s Knob, in 1770. Fort Morgan, at the present site of Morgantown, in 1772; Fort Dinwiddle, north several miles at Stewartstown, in 1772; Fort Martin, several miles north on the Monongahela River, in 1773; Fort Burris in the present-day Suncrest area of Morgantown, in 1774; and Fort Kern in the present-day Greenmont area of Morgantown, in 1774, in addition to other, smaller forts. Zackquill Morgan settled the area about 1772 by establishing a homestead near present-day Fayette Street and University Avenue. Morgan fought in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of colonel. By 1783, following his wartime duties, Colonel Morgan commissioned Major William Haymond to survey his land and divide it into streets and lots. Colonel Morgan then received a legal certificate for [ 400 acre km2 ] in the area of his settlement near the mouth of Decker&apos;s Creek. [ 50 acre m2 ] were appropriated for Morgan&apos;s Town by the Virginia General Assembly in October 1785. On February 3, 1838, the Virginia General Assembly enacted a municipal charter incorporating the city, now with a population of about 700, as Morgantown, Virginia. The town became part of the newly created state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863, through the Reorganized Government of Virginia.

The Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) has been in use since 1975. [ Geography and climate ] Morgantown is located at [ 39 38 1 N 79 57 2 W type:city ] (39.633696, -79.950670) [ 1 ]. The city is located [ 75 mi km ] south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, [ 208 mi km ] west of Washington, D.C., [ 204 mi km ] east of Columbus, Ohio, and [ 156 mi km ] northeast of Charleston, West Virginia. Morgantown is just south of the Mason-Dixon Line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.1  square miles (26.2  km²), of which 9.8  square miles (25.4  km²) is land and 0.3  square miles (0.8  km²) (3.16%) is water. [ Climate ] [ http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/wv/466212.pdf NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration October 2011 ] { October 2011 } [ Transportation ] [ Airport ] Morgantown Municipal Airport is one of West Virginia&apos;s few commercial airports. It is located approximately [ 3 mi ] northeast of the downtown along U.S. Route 119. [ Rail ] The only active rail line in Morgantown is owned by Norfolk Southern with CSX trackage rights and serves a mine located northwest of Rivesville, West Virginia. Coal is the major commodity with a train serving local chemical industries such as Tanner and Chemtura that require tank cars. Recently the railroad has begun to receive untreated crossties. These are trucked in and then loaded onto high side gondolas or bulkhead flat cars. The current railroad situation came about when Conrail was split by Norfolk Southern and CSX in 1999. CSX pays for half of the cost of maintenance for the line. CSX uses it mostly to quickly bring trains from Grafton to load at Consol&apos;s Bailey Mine and for direct access to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. [ River ] Morgantown relies heavily on the Monongahela River for shipping coal and other products. The river is fully navigable from its mouth at the Ohio River in Pittsburgh past Morgantown upstream to Fairmont. Morgantown Lock and Dam, located in the southern part of the city, provides a pool heading upstream towards Fairmont. Point Marion Lock and Dam, the next downstream dam, is responsible for most of the river&apos;s pool in Morgantown.

[ Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit ] Most of Morgantown is accessible by Mountain Line Transit Authority bus system. { Busride.org } Most service operates Monday-Saturday from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a very limited service operating on Sunday during the WVU school year. MountainLine&apos;s Grey Line bus operates every day of the year between Clarksburg, West Virginia and the Pittsburgh Airport. Morgantown also has the Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system. The system has five stations (Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical) covering 8.65 miles (13.9 km). [ Neighborhoods ] [ section November 2009 ] [ section November 2009 ] Morgantown is made up of several neighborhoods, some of which were previously independent towns that were annexed by the city as it continued to grow. Neighborhoods include First Ward, Woodburn, South Park, Jerome Park, South Hills, Second Ward, Greenmont, Suncrest, Evandales, Wiles Hill, Sunnyside, Sabraton, the Mileground, and North Hills. While some of these, such as the Mileground, Easton, and Sabraton, are in part or entirely outside the city limits, they are still considered part of Morgantown. The Morgantown MSA contains roughly 117,000 [ May 2012 ] permanent residents, excluding nearly 30,000 [ May 2012 ] full-time students at West Virginia University. [ Suncrest ] { Fort Burris was erected in 1774 in what became the Suncrest area of Morgantown. The fort was a settler&apos;s blockhouse located in what as of 2010 is the Summers Masonic Lodge at the intersection of Burroughs and Windsor streets. } During 1885-1888, the land in the Evansdale/Suncrest area was agricultural, with farms of [ 400 - 1000 acre km2 ]. Drummond&apos;s Chapel was named after a minister who then moved to Missouri. The Evans Farm was located on land near Riverview Drive and 8th Street and was named for Colonel John Evans, who fought in the American Revolution with Morgantown founder Zack Morgan. The Krepps farmhouse was located on land where the West Virginia University Creative Arts Center, Engineering and Agricultural buildings would later be built. Dilley Farm was located on the other side of 8th street. The Van Voorhis Farm was large. Down Collins Ferry Road was the Anderson Farm. The Jacobs Farm was below Elmhurst and Mulberry. Trolley cars determined how far people lived outside of the city, and did not reach to what is now Suncrest. By 1920, however, cars were becoming common. In 1923, the Monongahela Development Company bought land from Krepps and most others else in the area. Suncrest Park bought Sears Roebuck house plans and divided Suncrest into three areas: Fairfield Street, Suncrest Park and Suncrest. No African-American s, Jew s or immigrants were permitted to buy land there. In 1928, the Suncrest Home Association developers gave [ 30 acre m2 ] for what became Krepps Park. A civic group built facilities and the park was given to Morgantown, which made some improvements. By 1937, Suncrest needed a town government to pave streets and provide water and sewer. Dr. Julian Leach, a WVU plant pathologist, was elected mayor; Bill Hart was a later mayor. Suncrest finally became part of Morgantown. In 1940 the Dupont industrial park around the Kenmore Street area built 100 homes with six different floor plans. From 1947 to 1950, Gunnison homes were built in the Mulberry and Lake Street areas. The development of the DuPont Ordinance Works during World War II in Westover resulted in a large number of prefabricated homes being constructed in Suncrest. Old Suncrest and Suncrest Addition were among the names given to various subsections of this growing community. The names of some streets reflected the community’s participation in various service organizations, such as Civitan, Kiwanis, Lions and Rotary. Before Suncrest became part of Morgantown in 1949, it had first been incorporated in 1937 as the town of Suncrest; the name came from a developer who looked out one morning and saw the sun crest over a hill. The area from University Avenue to the university&apos;s medical school held a racetrack at one point. When there was talk of building a medical school in West Virginia, Charleston and Huntington vied for it, but Morgantown offered to give [ 60 acre m2 ] and provide a county hospital. A cemetery with 200 graves near what is now Ruby Memorial Hospital had to be relocated to the West Run area. Around 1928, there was an airport near where the West Virginia University Coliseum was later built. Suncrest students attend three or four schools throughout their K-12 education, starting at Suncrest Primary School or North Elementary School, Suncrest Middle School and Morgantown High School depending on where they live. In 2000, the White House Millennium Council designated Suncrest as a Millennium Community. [ August 2011 ] [ Sunnyside ] Sunnyside, located just north of downtown Morgantown, is an older neighborhood adjacent to West Virginia University&apos;s downtown campus. The neighborhood, which covers [ 130 acre ], is roughly bounded by University Avenue to the east, Campus Drive to the south, the Monongahela River to the west, and 8th Street to the north. Many students live there because it is affordable and is in close proximity to campus. Since 2003, Sunnyside has been classified as a &quot; blighted district. &quot; Sunnyside is also the scene of many off-campus parties and post-game celebrations centered on Grant Avenue. To combat the problems facing Sunnyside, the City of Morgantown and West Virginia University teamed up to establish the Sunnyside Up Project: Campus Neighborhoods Revitalization Corporation, dedicated to the redevelopment of this area. The first step was to create a comprehensive revitalization plan, which was published in Fall of 2004. The University&apos;s Summit Hall Dormitory and the new Honors Hall Dormitory are located in the southern part of the neighborhood. [ First Ward ] First Ward is located south of High Street in Morgantown. First Ward Elementary School was formerly located there; however, it was demolished and the playground area converted to Jack Roberts Park, one of two parks in the area long with White Park. Both include recreational facilities. The city&apos;s reservoir is in this neighborhood and sports several biking and hiking trails on almost all sides. The Mountaineer Mall, Morgantown&apos;s first mall, is located here, as are South Middle School and the Monongalia County Technical Eduction Center. The Wharf District is located along the west side of First Ward, on the banks of the Monongahela River. [ South Park ] South Park is across Deckers Creek from downtown Morgantown. Originally farmland, it was one of the first suburbs of Morgantown. In the early 20th century, South Park saw a housing boom, with wealthy and influential citizens settling there. The neighborhood is home to Morgantown High School, built in 1924 and recently expanded. The neighborhood is designated a historic district by the National Register of Historic Places. [ Woodburn ] Woodburn was originally farmland on the hills to the east of downtown Morgantown. It encompasses the area enclosed by Richwood Avenue in the south and Willey Street in the north. Monongalia Avenue serves as the western boundary and the eastern boundary begins in the south at the intersection of Richwood Avenue and Darst Street, and continues north until Darst intersects with Willey Street at the beginning of the Mileground. While originally home to small hillside farmsteads, Woodburn in the late 19th century grew into a typical city neighborhood. Many of the street names, such as Louise Avenue, James Street, and Ridgeway Avenue, are named for early farm families, and many of the original farmhouses remain standing in the first decade of the 21st century. The area saw a rapid growth in population at the beginning of the 20th century as home to tinsmiths from Wales who came to work in the tinplate mill that later became the Sterling Faucet plant in Sabraton. A trolley line ran the length of Richwood Avenue and originally connected downtown with Sabraton. The Welsh community was active in the Methodist Church at the intersection of High Street and Willey Street, and held picnics in Whitmore Park, the main green space in Woodburn. { Boparc.org } Many of these immigrants retained the Welsh language, and as late as the 1930s it was common to hear Welsh spoken on the streets of Woodburn and the community was known for carrying on a traditional eisteddfod every year. Woodburn Elementary School was the neighborhood school built in 1910. Following World War II, many new families came to Woodburn, attracted by the parkland, close proximity to downtown, community atmosphere, and nearby school. Actor David Selby spent his childhood living in Woodburn. [ November 2009 ] In 1950, Tom and Anna Torch opened the Richwood Avenue Confectionary, a corner store and lunch counter that served beer in large Weiss goblets from the Morgantown Glassworks. When they sold the operation in 1963 to Mario and Rose Spina, the establishment was nicknamed &quot; Marios Fishbowl &quot; in honor of the goblets. A neighborhood newspaper was published here in the 1980s. [ Demographics ] [ http://www.polsci.wvu.edu/wv/Monongalia/monhistory.html Monongalia County History Dr. Robert Jay Dilger West Virginia University 28 November 2011 ] [ http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/index.html CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING (1790-2000) U.S. Census Bureau 2012-03-10 ] As of the census [ 2 ] of 2000, there were 26,809 people, 10,782 households, and 4,183 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,736.0 people per square mile (1,056.2/km²). There were 11,721 housing units at an average density of 1,196.2 per square mile (461.8/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 89.48% White, 4.15% African American, 0.17% Native American, 4.15% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 0.51% from other races, and 1.48% from two or more races.

The average household size was 2.08 and the average family size was 2.76. Morgantown&apos;s age distribution, which is heavily influenced by the presence of West Virginia University, is: 11.1% under the age of 18, 44.7% from 18 to 24, 20.4% from 25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 23 years. For every 100 females there were 104.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.0 males. The median income for a household in the city was $20,649, and the median income for a family was $44,622. Males had a median income of $33,268 versus $24,944 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,459. About 15.0% of families and 38.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 23.3% of those under age 18 and 8.3% of those age 65 or over. Following Census 2000, Monongalia County (with county seat Morgantown) and neighboring Preston County were acknowledged as a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) by the United States government. Estimates from 2004 put the Metropolitan Statistical Area population at 113,500; as of July 2005, the estimate was 114,501. Of the 10 largest cities in West Virginia, only Morgantown and Martinsburg have shown positive population growth since the 2000 census, with Morgantown growing from 26,809 to a 2007 estimate of 29,361. { City-Data.com: Morgantown, West Virginia } West Virginia University constitutes [ 913 acre km2 ] of the city and vicinity, and with the fall 2005 enrollment added an additional population of 27,115 students. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Morgantown has amongst the lowest unemployment rates in the United States as of early 2009. [ Education ] The city is served by Monongalia County Schools. Public elementary schools in Morgantown and its surrounding area include Cheat Lake, North, Brookhaven, Ridgedale, Mountainview, Mylan Park, and Skyview. There are four middle schools: Mountaineer Middle, South, Westwood, and Suncrest. [ Middle Schools http://boe.mono.k12.wv.us/schools/midschools.html Monongalia County Schools January 8, 2011 ] The city&apos;s two high schools are University High School, the mascot of which is the Hawks, and Morgantown High School, whose mascot is the Mohigans. The latter&apos;s name is that of a non-existent Native American tribe whose name is a combination of the words Morgantown (MO) High (HIG) Annual (AN), which was the school&apos;s yearbook. The Native American mascot and logo were adopted because of the close relation to the name Mohican, a real Native American tribe.

As of April 2005, Monongalia County Schools employs 897 professional personnel and 490 service personnel, and carries an enrollment of 10,076 students, including 156 adult students at the Monongalia County Technical Education Center. Three of Monongalia County&apos;s 23 schools have earned Exemplary Achievement status, according to the West Virginia Office of Educational Performance Audits&apos; (OEPA) report issued November 2004. In 2004, Suncrest Middle became a National Blue Ribbon School for the No Child Left Behind Act. Other private schools include: Covenant Christian School, Maranatha Christian Academy, Morgantown Christian Academy, Trinity Christian School, St. Francis Elementary/Middle School, and the alternative, non-religious Morgantown Learning Academy. [ Early schools ] While informal schools existed from Morgantown&apos;s earliest days, { Core, Earl L., The Monongalia Story: A Bicentennial History, Vol. 3: Discord (Parsons, W.Va., McClain Printing Co., 1979), p. 97 } the town established a one-story, coeducational, Virginia common school in July 1803, that students attended on a tuition basis. { Ambler, Charles Henry. A History of Education in West Virginia from Early Colonial Times to 1949 (Huntington, W.Va., Standard Printing and Publishing Co., 1951), p. 2 } On Nov. 29, 1814, the Virginia General Assembly incorporated Monongalia Academy, the county&apos;s first public school. { Core, pp. 26-27 } Supported by obligatory surveyor s &apos; fees, the male-only institution was the equivalent of a modern-day high school. { Core, p. 45 } The Academy moved to a new two-story building in 1830, with principal Jonathan Haddock offering courses in geography, surveying, and navigation in addition to traditional subjects. Presbyterian minister Reverend James Robertson Moore was principal during the Academy&apos;s 1852-1864 heyday, when its enrollment included students from 14 states. { Core, p. 384 } In 1867, the Academy closed, and donated its land toward the establishment of West Virginia University. The Virginia Assembly in March 1831 authorized the creation of the Morgantown Female Academy. Proceeds from the sale of the original Monongalia Academy building funded construction of a two-story school at Bumbo Lane (the modern-day Fayette Street) and Long Alley (the modern-day Chestnut Street). This school opened April 1, 1834. { Core, p. 114 } After the Assembly approved a charter change in 1838, the school became known as the Methodist Academy. { Core, p. 230 } This prompted local Presbyterians to create the Woodburn Female Seminary, for which the Monongalia Academy&apos;s Rev. Moore also served as principal. The seminary closed in 1866, and its assets, like those of the Monongalia Academy, were donated toward the future university. Following the 1863 creation of West Virginia, the new state&apos;s first legislature created a public-school system. The act provided for the education of &quot; free colored children &quot;, and was adapted three years later to mandate education for all African-American children. However, a two-tier system was created: White children attended a regular term (at the second former Monongalia Academy building, purchased in 1867 from West Virginia Agricultural College, the future West Virginia University), only a short term was provided for African-Americans, who met at St. Paul&apos;s African Methodist Episcopal Church, on Beechurst Avenue. { Core, pp. 54, 632 } [ Roman Catholic schools ] St. Francis High School building, 2006 A Roman Catholic elementary school, Saint Francis de Sales, began sometime prior to 1915 as a two-room school in a house on McLane Avenue in the Seneca neighborhood, and run by lay teacher Miss Sterbutsal, who became Sister M. Isabelle of the Sisters of St. Joseph. In October 1915, the pastorate of Father Peter Flynn arranged for Ursuline nuns from Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1918, under principal Sister M. Isadore, the school moved to a new building on Beechurst Avenue, adjacent to St. Theresa &apos;s Church. On June 9, 1990, the grade school moved into the former St. Francis Central High School building, [ http://falcon.sfcc.pvt.k12.wv.us/history.shtm History St Francis de Sales Central Catholic School http://web.archive.org/web/20070606080033/http%3A//falcon.sfcc.pvt.k12.wv.us/history.shtm June 6, 2007 ] and eventually into newly built facility at 41 Guthrie Lane. { &apos;&apos;Morgantown Times&apos;&apos;: &quot; St. Francis de Sales Central Catholic School Dedication: Bishop Michael Bransfield to Bless New Building &quot; (press release, no date) } Its mascot is the Falcon. The Beechurst Avenue building was demolished in 2003. [ August 2011 ] St. Francis Central High School existed for several decades on Birch Street in the Evansdale neighborhood until that campus was taken over by the elementary school on June 9, 1990. Its mascot was the Trojans, [ August 2011 ] and its football field was named for Father Flynn. [ August 2011 ] The West Virginia University Foundation purchased its building and land in July 2003, formally selling it to WVU for $11 million in August 2004, with the university then announcing it intended to use the football and adjacent baseball fields as intramural recreation area. { WVU Today: (Sept. 2, 2004): &quot; WVU board authorizes salary increase package, facility plans &quot; (press release) } Through January 2006, the building housed the St. Francis middle and elementary schools.
