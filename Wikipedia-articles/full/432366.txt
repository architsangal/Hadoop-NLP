Founded by Carl Stotz in 1939 as a three- team league in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Little League Baseball encourages local volunteers to organize and operate Little League programs that are annually chartered through Little League International. Each league can structure itself to best serve the children in the area in which the league operates. Several specific divisions of Little League baseball and softball are available to children ages 5 to 18. The organization holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. { 36 U.S.C. §§ 130501-130513, Chapter 1305—Little League Baseball, Incorporated } The organization&apos;s administrative office is located in South Williamsport. The first Little League Baseball World Series was played in Williamsport in 1947. The Little League International Complex hosts the annual Little League Baseball World Series at Howard J. Lamade Stadium and Little League Volunteer Stadium, and is also the site of the Peter J. McGovern Little League Museum, which provides a history of Little League Baseball and Softball through interactive exhibits for children. [ History ] Carl Stotz, a resident of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, founded Little League Baseball in 1939. He began experimenting with his idea in the summer of 1938 when he gathered his nephews, Jimmy and Major Gehron and their neighborhood friends. They tried different field dimensions over the course of the summer and played several informal games. The following summer Stotz felt that he was ready to establish what later became Little League Baseball. The first league in Williamsport had just three teams, each sponsored by a different business. The first teams, Jumbo Pretzel, Lycoming Dairy, and Lundy Lumber were managed by Carl Stotz and two of his friends, George and Bert Bebble. The men, joined by their wives and another couple, formed the first-ever Little League Board of Directors. Stotz&apos; dream of establishing a baseball league for boys to teach fair play and teamwork had come true.

Lundy Lumber defeated Lycoming Dairy, 23-8. Lycoming Dairy came back to claim the league championship. They, the first-half-season champion s, defeated Lundy Lumber, the second-half champs, in a best-of-three season-ending series. The following year a second league was formed in Williamsport, and from there Little League Baseball grew to become an international organization of nearly 200,000 teams in every U.S. state and over 80 countries around the world. From 1951 through 1974, Little League was for boys only. In 1974, Little League rules were revised to allow participation by girls in the baseball program following the result of a lawsuit filed by the National Organization for Women on behalf of Maria Pepe. { Little League: History and Mission: Chronology } [ http://www.littleleague.org/media/newsarchive/05_2004/04mariapepeopening.htm Little League World Series Opening Ceremony to Mark 30th Anniversary of Decision Allowing Girls to Play August 9, 2004 2009-09-13 ] According to the Little League Baseball and Softball participation statistics following the 2008 season, there were nearly 2.6 million players in Little League Baseball world wide, including both boys and girls, including 400,000 registered in Softball (also including both boys and girls). For tournament purposes, Little League Baseball is divided into 16 geographic region s; eight National and eight international. Each summer, Little League operates seven World Series tournaments at various locations throughout the U.S. (Little League softball and Junior, Senior, and Big League baseball and softball).

[ http://www.littleleague.org/learn/about/divisions/baseball/llbb.htm Little League Baseball (or the Major Division) Little League Baseball, Incorporated May 12, 2010 ] [ Tee-Ball ] &quot; Tee Ball Baseball is for boys and girls 5–6 years old (with a local option for 7- and/or 8-year-olds) who want to learn the fundamentals of hitting and fielding. In Tee Ball, players hit a ball off a batting tee. Rules of the game may be varied to accommodate the need for teaching. The primary goals of Tee Ball are to instruct children in the fundamentals of baseball and to allow them to experience the value of teamwork. Rosters may be composed of between 12 and 20 players, but most leagues have rosters in the 12-15 range. No live pitching is permitted in this division, although leagues may adopt &quot; coach pitching &quot; in which the coach lightly pitches the ball. Generally, the diamond used is a 60-foot diamond, but the league has the option to use a 50-foot diamond. &quot; [ Minor Leagues ] Minor League Baseball programs for boys and girls may be operated within each division for younger players with less experience. The minor league may be players ages 7–12. Divisions may be established within the Minor League targeting various age groups, and are typically named using terms like &quot; Farm &quot;, &quot; AA &quot; or &quot; AAA &quot;. Typically the lowest level is machine pitch, and the top level is player pitch. In-between may be a coach pitch level, or a level with a faster machines. The rules of baseball are increasingly complete as the play level advances. Unlike other youth sports leagues, the levels are not strictly by age, but by try-outs. Advanced plays can &quot; play up &quot; if they can get selected. Similarly, less advanced players can petition to &quot; play down &quot;. A local league target 9-year olds in a division, but some 8-year olds will be in the division playing up and some 10-year olds might be there playing down. In this system, playing down does not carry a stigma and many choose to play down and get more experience at key positions. This is entirely the choice of the local league board of directors. Rosters may be composed of between 12 and 20 players, but most leagues have rosters in the 12-15 range. The diamond used is a 60-foot diamond and the pitching distance is 46 feet. &quot; [ 9-10 Year Olds ] &quot; The 9-10 Year Old Baseball Division for boys and girls was established as a tournament program in 1994. It gives children of this age the opportunity to experience tournament competition, up to state level. Players on these teams can be chosen from among Major Division and/or Minor Division teams. The diamond used is a 60-foot diamond and the pitching distance is 46 feet. &quot; [ Little League (or the Major Division) ] [ Little League World Series ] &quot; The Little League Baseball Division (sometimes known as the Major Division) is for boys and girls ages 9–12. A local league may choose to limit its Major Division to 10-, 11- and 12-year-olds, or 11-12-year-olds. The diamond used is a 60-foot diamond and the pitching distance is 46 feet. The local league has an option to choose a Tournament Team (or &quot; All Stars &quot; ) of 11-12-year-olds from within this division, and the team may enter the International Tournament. The culmination of the International Tournament is the Little League Baseball World Series, featuring teams from around the globe. All expenses for the teams advancing to the World Series (travel, meals and housing) are paid by Little League Baseball. &quot; [ &quot; Pilot &quot; division for ages 12–13 ] In 2010, Little League announced plans to add a &quot; pilot &quot; division in baseball for ages 12–13, to help baseball Little Leaguers make the transition to regulation-size fields in Junior League Baseball. [ Junior League ] [ Junior, Senior &amp; Big League Baseball ] &quot; The Junior League Baseball Division is a program for boys and girls ages 13–14, using a conventional 90-foot diamond with a pitching distance of 60 feet, 6 inches.

All expenses for the teams advancing to the World Series (travel, meals and housing) are paid by Little League Baseball. &quot; [ Challenger Division ] Little League introduced the Challenger Division in 1989 to provide opportunities for children with physical and developmental challenges to participate in the Little League program. The Challenger Division utilizes a &quot; buddy system &quot; in which Little Leaguers assist Challenger participants in the areas of batting, running and fielding. Challenger Division games are typically non-competitive in nature.. [ http://www.LittleLeagueChallenger.org Little League Challenger Division Little League Baseball, Incorporated March 3, 2012 ] As of 2011, nearly 1,000 Little Leagues around the world offered the Challenger Division providing an opportunity for more than 30,000 children with physical or developmental challenges to participate in the Little League program.

Little League has been criticized for requiring payment to view its rules. However, the organization counters by claiming it has been exposed to lawsuits in the past in cases involving organizations not officially affiliated with Little League but which nonetheless use its rules. [ Length of Game ] A regulation game is six innings. If the game is called prior to the completion of six innings, it is considered an official game if four innings have been completed (three and a half, if the home team leads); otherwise, if at least one inning has been completed, it is a suspended game. In the Junior, Senior, and Big League levels (ages 13–18), a game is seven innings and is official if five innings have been completed. [ Mandatory Play Rule ] In all divisions except Senior and Big League, every player on the team roster must have at least one plate appearance and play three consecutive outs on defense in each game. The penalty for a manager violating the rule is a two-game suspension. This rule is waived if the game is completed prior to the usual duration of the game (six innings in Little League and below, seven innings in Junior League). [ Playing Field ] The size of the field is dependent on the division of play. { Little League Rule Summary } Tee Ball The distance between the bases is generally 50 feet. Minor League and Little League The distance between the bases is 60 feet and the distance from the pitcher’s mound to home plate is 46 feet. Outfield fences must be at least 165 feet from home plate, but are usually 200 feet or more (the fields at the Williamsport complex have fences 225 feet away). The bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball. Also, unlike fields at almost all levels of competitive baseball for teenagers and adults, the distance between home plate and the outfield fence is constant throughout fair territory. Junior League, Senior League, and Big League The distance between the bases is 90 feet, the same as for regulation Major League Baseball fields. The distance between the pitcher&apos;s mound to home plate is 60.5 feet, also identical to that of MLB. The minimum outfield distance in the upper divisions is 300 feet (compare with MLB&apos;s official but not strictly enforced minimum of 325 feet at the foul lines), while the maximum for Big League is 425 feet. (Base paths of 80 feet are optional for Junior League regular season play.) [ Equipment ] A Little Leaguer executing a bunt Bats (all levels) may be made from material other than wood (such as aluminum ) and must be approved for use in Little League Baseball. The maximum bat length is thirty-three (33) inches and maximum barrel diameter may not exceed 2 [ 1 4 ]  inches. Beginning in 2009 all Little League bats must be labeled with a Bat Performance Factor (BPF) of 1.15 or lower. Bats for the Junior League level may have a maximum length of thirty-four (34) inches and a maximum barrel diameter of 2 [ 5 8 ]  inches. Bats for the Big and Senior League levels may have a maximum length of thirty-six (36) inches and a maximum barrel diameter of 2 [ 3 4 ]  inches for wood bats and 2 [ 5 8 ]  inches for non-wood bats. Big and Senior League bats must meet the Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitution (BBCOR) testing standards that are currently used in the NCAA and NFHS (high school). { The BESR (Ball Exit Speed Ratio) } [ Base running ] When the pitcher is ready to pitch, a baserunner may not leave the bag until the pitch reaches the batter. If a fielder is waiting at the base with the ball, an advancing runner must attempt to avoid contact. A runner may not slide head-first except when retreating to a previously held base. In the upper levels, runners must still make an attempt to avoid contact if possible, and may not maliciously initiate contact with a fielder. [ Batting ] The upper limit of the strike zone extends to the batter&apos;s armpits. { THE STRIKE ZONE: Location, Location, Location, Little League &amp; copy; Online } In Tee-Ball, Minor League, and Little League (if &apos;uncaught third strike&apos; rule is waived by the local league), the batter is out after the third strike regardless of whether the pitched ball is held by the catcher. In Little League, Junior, Senior, and Big League, a batter may attempt to advance to first base on a dropped third strike. [ Substitution ] Players who have been substituted for may return to the game under certain conditions, though a pitcher who has left the game may not return to pitch. [ Pitchers ] Pitcher s in all divisions are limited to a specific pitch count per game and a mandatory rest period between outings. These vary with age and the rest period also depends on the number of pitches thrown. { Pitch Count Resource Page, Little League &amp; copy; Online } Also, prior to 2008 a pitcher could intentionally walk a batter by simply announcing his intent to do so and not have to actually throw any pitches; however, beginning in 2008 the pitcher must now actually pitch the required four balls (which are counted against the pitch count). [ Local options ] Local leagues have a certain amount of flexibility. For example, a league may opt to use the &quot; continuous batting order &quot; rule (4.04), under which each player on the team’s roster bats, even when not in the defensive lineup. Leagues may also waive the &quot; ten-run rule &quot; (4.10(e)) which ends the game if one team is ahead by ten or more runs after four innings. { Rules of Little League, Seattle Community Network (scn.org) } { Little League Rules and Interpretations of Note, Western Maine Board of Baseball Umpires (wmbumpires.com) } [ See also ] Amateur baseball in the United States Major League Baseball List of organized baseball leagues Baseball awards#World Baseball awards#U.S. youth baseball Baseball clothing and equipment Going To Bat Foundation [ References ] [ General ] Van Auken, Lance and Robin.
