Pospelov, Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira (Moscow, 1998), p. 82. } Alternative explanations derive it from a Slavic verb brniti (to armor or to fortify) or a Celtic language spoken in the area before it was overrun by Germanic peoples and later Slavic peoples (this theory would make it cognate with other Celtic words for hill, such as the Welsh word bryn). Throughout its history, Brno&apos;s locals also used to refer to the town in other languages, including Brünn in German, ברין (Brin) in Yiddish and Bruna in Latin. The Asteroid 2889 Brno was named after the city, as well as the Bren light machine gun (Brno + &apos;&apos;&apos;En&apos;&apos;&apos;field ), a famous gun of World War II.

In the 11th century a chapel was founded on the Petrov hill, since then, the chapel has undergone many changes which after centuries resulted in the current Gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul.

[ http://www.opatbrno.cz/opat_hist_en.htm Opatství svatého Tomáše na Starém Brně 3 October 2011 ] In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century the Spilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia (Moravian rulers), one of them was elected the King of the Romans. In the 1641 Brno became the sole capital of Moravia. During the 17th century Spilberk Castle was rebuild into a huge baroque citadel. In 1777 the Brno Bishopric was established.

But both attempts to conquer the city failed. In the 17th century Swedish army under the leadership of General Lennart Torstenson laid siege to the city in 1643 and in 1645. This was an important part of the Thirty Years&apos; War, and Brno was the only city in Moravia which succeeded in defending itself against Swedish sieges. In the 18th century Brno was besieged by Prussians in 1742 under the leadership of Frederick the Great, but also without success. In December 1805, Battle of Austerlitz, took place nearby the city, the battle is also known as the &quot; Battle of the Three Emperors &quot;. Brno itself didn&apos;t interfere with the battle but the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte spent several nights here and again in 1809. In the year 1945 Brno was conquered by the Red Army under the leadership of Rodion Malinovsky, ending seven years of occupation by Nazi Germany. [ The capital city of Moravia ] Coat of arms of the margraviate In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each one of them had its own ruler independent of the other two. Seats of these rulers and thus &quot; capitals &quot; of these territories were castles/towns of Brno, Olomouc, Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. Since then, until the mid 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was therefore &quot; evenly &quot; divided between Brno and Olomouc but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet (cz: zemský sněm), the Moravian Land Tables (cz: zemské desky), and the Moravian Supreme Court (cz: zemský soud) were all seated in both cities at once. Brno was the seat of Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its position closer to Vienna also became important. While Olomouc was larger than Brno, and it was the seat of the only bishopric in Moravia. [ Since 1573, Olomouc was also the seat of the only Moravian university at that time. &quot; note &quot; ] In 1641, in the midst of the Thirty Years&apos; War, the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia Ferdinand III commanded permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno, as Olomouc&apos;s Collegium Nordicum made it one of the primary targets of Swedish armies. [ Rome and the Counter-Reformation in Scandinavia: The age of Gustavus Adolphus and Queen Christina of Sweden, 1622-1656 Oskar Garstein BRILL 1992 ] In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish army which then stayed there for 8 years, [ This led to decline in population of Olomouc from over 30.000 people to mere 1.675 and total devastation of the city. &quot; note &quot; ] Meanwhile Brno, as the only Moravian city which managed to defend itself, served as the sole capital of the state (Margaviate of Moravia). After the war (1648), Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution. [ However, Olomouc also had legal status of capital city, although this title was purely a honorary matter rather than a real role, sometimes it was referred to as &quot; the Secondary Capital &quot;. &quot; note &quot; ] In 1948 the communist government of Czechoslovakia abolished Moravian autonomy, stripped Brno of its title, and transferred all political power in the country into one center which is Prague. At the present day, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the Moravian Regional Archive, and ranks among the national cultural sights of the Czech republic.

Seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (cz: země Moravskoslezská). In 1939 Brno was occupied by the army of Nazi Germany, and in 1945 it was conquered by the Red Army. When the First World War ended in 1918, the population of Brno included about 55,000 German speakers. Most of Brno&apos;s Jewish population of about 12,000 was murdered during the Nazi occupation of 1939-45. The Czech university was closed by Nazis in 1939 and university dormitory was used as headquarters of the Gestapo. About 35.000 Czechs and American and British POW´s were arrested and tortured here and about 800 civilians were killed here (incl. kids) and executions were public for local Germans for 3 RM fee. After the end of the Second World War in 1945, the surviving ethnic German residents were forcibly expelled, as was the case throughout Czechoslovakia. In the so-called “Brünn death march,” beginning on May 31, 1945, about 27,000 Brno Germans were marched 40 miles overland to the Austrian border. According to postwar testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them lost their lives in this process. { Bundesministerium für Vertriebene, Flüchtlinge und Kriegsgeschädigte &amp; Theodor Schieder Hgg.: Die Vertreibung der Deutschen aus Ost-Mitteleuropa.

The people had never seen such a beast before so they called it a dragon. They trembled in fear of the dragon until a brave man decided to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime.

Crocodile motifs are common in Brno: a krokodil is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl.Beside the dragon the second town emblem is displayed, a waggon wheel made from a tree fifty miles from the city. For a wager, a local man felled the tree, made the wheel, and rolled it to Brno in a single day.
