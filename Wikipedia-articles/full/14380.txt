It is rare on Earth, and is sought for use in nuclear fusion research. The abundance of helium-3 is thought to be greater on the Moon (embedded in the upper layer of regolith by the solar wind over billions of years) [ October 2011 ] and the solar system &apos;s gas giant s (left over from the original solar nebula ), though still low in quantity (28 ppm of lunar regolith is helium-4 and from 1 ppb to 50 ppb is helium-3).

Its existence was first proposed in 1934 by the Australian nuclear physicist Mark Oliphant while based at Cambridge University &apos;s Cavendish Laboratory, in an experiment in which fast deuteron s were reacted with other deuteron targets (the first demonstration of nuclear fusion). [ Transmutation Effects Observed with Heavy Hydrogen M. L. E. Oliphant Harteck, P.; Rutherford, E. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Alvarez and Robert Cornog in a cyclotron experiment at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in 1939. [ 1981 Newsmagazine Publication http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fepi1.html Lawrence and His Laboratory: Episode: A Productive Error 2009-09-01 ] Although helium-3 was found to be about 10,000 times more rare with respect to helium-4 in helium from wells, its significant presence in underground gas deposits implied that it either did not decay, or else had an extremely long half-life compatible with a primordial isotope. Helium-3 occurs as a primordial nuclide, escaping from the Earth&apos;s crust into the atmosphere and into space, over time. It is also a natural nucleogenic and cosmogenic nuclide, produced when lithium is bombarded by natural neutrons generated by spontaneous fission, and by cosmic rays. Some helium-3 in the atmosphere is also a relic of open air thermonuclear weapon testing. Tritium, with a roughly 12-year half-life, decays into helium-3, which can be recovered. Irradiation of lithium in a nuclear reactor —either a fusion or fission reactor—can also produce tritium, and thus (after decay) helium-3. [ October 2011 ] Helium-3 is proposed as a second-generation fusion fuel for fusion power uses, but such systems are still in very early experimental development phases. Helium-3 is used in neutron detection, and extremely low temperature cryogenics. It has been used as a magnetizable ( hyperpolarized ) gas to carry out nuclear magnetic imaging studies of the lungs. [ October 2011 ] [ Physical properties ] Owing to its lower atomic mass (3.0160293 amu ), helium-3 has significantly different properties from helium-4 (4.0026 amu). Because of the weak, induced dipole-dipole interaction between helium atoms, their macroscopic physical properties are mainly determined by zero point energy (groundstate kinetic energy), and the microscopic properties of helium-3 cause it to have higher zero point energy, which means helium-3 can overcome dipole-dipole interaction with less thermal energy than helium-4. Helium-3 boils at 3.19 kelvin compared to helium-4&apos;s 4.23  K, and its critical point is also lower at 3.35  K, compared to helium-4&apos;s 5.19  K. It has less than half the density when liquid at its boiling point: 0.059  g/ml compared to helium-4&apos;s 0.12473  g/ml at one atmosphere. Its latent heat of vaporization is also considerably lower at 0.026   kJ/mol compared to helium-4&apos;s 0.0829  kJ/mol. { Teragon&apos;s Summary of Cryogen Properties Teragon Research, 2005 } [ Fusion reactions ] [ http://members.tm.net/lapointe/IEC_Fusion.html Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion 2007-05-06 ] [ http://www.lancs.ac.uk/ug/suttond1/#fusion Nuclear Fission and Fusion 2007-05-06 http://web.archive.org/web/20070404153838/http%3A//www.lancs.ac.uk/ug/suttond1/#fusion 2007-04-04 ] [ http://library.thinkquest.org/28383/nowe_teksty/htmla/2_37a.html The Fusion Reaction 2007-05-06 ] [ http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/pdf/fdm1291.pdf PDF A Strategy for D – 3 He Development John Santarius June 2006 2007-05-06 ] [ http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/nucrea.html Nuclear Reactions 2007-05-06 ] Comparison of neutronicity of reactions Reactants Products Q n/MeV First-generation fusion fuels 2 1 H + 2 1 H (D-D) → 3 2 He + 1 0 n 3.268 MeV 0.306 2 1 H + 2 1 H (D-D) → 3 1 H + 1 1 p 4.032 MeV 0 2 1 H + 3 1 H (D-T) → 4 2 He + 1 0 n 17.571 MeV 0.057 Second-generation fusion fuel 2 1 H + 3 2 He (D- 3 He) → 4 2 He + 1 1 p 18.354 MeV 0 Third-generation fusion fuels 3 2 He + 3 2 He → 4 2 He + 2 1 1 p 12.86 MeV 0 11 5 B + 1 1 p → 3 4 2 He 8.68 MeV 0 Net result of D burning (sum of first 4 rows) 6D → 2( 4 He + n + p) 43.225 MeV 0.046 Current nuclear fuel 235 U + n → 2 FP + 2.5n ~200 MeV 0.001 The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70  keV, or 800 million kelvins) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy. Some fusion processes produce highly energetic neutrons which render reactor components radioactive with activation product s through the continuous bombardment of the reactor&apos;s components with emitted neutrons. Because of this bombardment and irradiation, power generation must occur indirectly through thermal means, as in a fission reactor. However, the appeal of helium-3 fusion stems from the aneutronic nature of its reaction products. Helium-3 itself is non-radioactive. The lone high-energy by-product, the proton, can be contained using electric and magnetic fields. The momentum energy of this proton (created in the fusion process) will interact with the containing electromagnetic field, resulting in direct net electricity generation. [ http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/presentations/jfs_ieee0904.pdf PDF Lunar 3 He and Fusion Power John Santarius September 28, 2004 2007-05-06 ] Because of the higher Coulomb barrier, the temperatures required for 2 1 H + 3 2 He fusion are much higher than those of conventional 2 &lt; sub &gt; 1 &lt; /sup &gt; H + 3 1 H ( deuterium + tritium ) fusion. Moreover, since both reactants need to be mixed together to fuse, reactions between nuclei of the same reactant will occur, and the D-D reaction ( 2 1 H + 2 1 H ) does produce a neutron. Reaction rates vary with temperature, but the D- 3 He reaction rate is never greater than 3.56 times the D-D reaction rate (see graph). Therefore fusion using D- 3 He fuel may produce a somewhat lower neutron flux than D-T fusion, but is by no means clean, negating some of its main attraction. A second possibility, fusing 3 2 He with itself ( 3 2 He + 3 2 He), requires even higher temperatures (since now both reactants have a +2 charge), and thus is even more difficult than the D- 3 He reaction. However, it does offer a possible reaction that produces no neutrons; the protons it produces possess charges and can be contained using electric and magnetic fields, which in turn results in direct electricity generation. 3 2 He + 3 2 He fusion has been demonstrated in the laboratory and is thus theoretically feasible and would have immense advantages, but commercial viability is many years in the future. [ http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/19296/ Mining the Moon: Lab experiments suggest that future fusion reactors could use helium-3 gathered from the moon Mark Williams MIT Technology Review August 23, 2007 2011-01-25 ] The amounts of helium-3 needed as a replacement for conventional fuel s are substantial by comparison to amounts currently available. The total amount of energy produced in the 2 1 H  +   3 2 He reaction is 18.4 M eV, which corresponds to some 493 megawatt-hour s (4.93×10 8 W·h) per three gram s (one mole ) of ³He. Even if that total amount of energy could be converted to electrical power with 100% efficiency (a physical impossibility), it would correspond to about 30 minutes of output of a gigawatt electrical plant; a year&apos;s production by the same plant would require some 17.5 kilograms of helium-3. The amount of fuel needed for large-scale applications can also be put in terms of total consumption: According to the US Energy Information Administration, &quot; Electricity consumption by 107 million U.S. households in 2001 totaled 1,140 billion kW·h &quot; (1.14×10 15 W·h). Again assuming 100% conversion efficiency, 6.7 tonne s of helium-3 would be required for that segment of the energy demand of the United States, 15 to 20 tonnes given a more realistic end-to-end conversion efficiency. [ January 2011 ] [ Neutron detection ] Helium-3 is a most important isotope in instrumentation for neutron detection. It has a high absorption cross section for thermal neutron beams and is used as a converter gas in neutron detectors. The neutron is converted through the nuclear reaction n + 3 He → 3 H + 1 H + 0.764 MeV into charged particles tritium (T, 3 H) and protium (p, 1 H) which then are detected by creating a charge cloud in the stopping gas of a proportional counter or a Geiger-Müller tube. { A Modular Neutron Detector | Summer 2003| Los Alamos National Laboratory. Lanl.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-08. } Furthermore, the absorption process is strongly spin -dependent, which allows a spin-polarized helium-3 volume to transmit neutrons with one spin component while absorbing the other. This effect is employed in neutron polarization analysis, a technique which probes for magnetic properties of matter. { NCNR Neutron Spin Filters. Ncnr.nist.gov (2004-04-28).

Retrieved on 2011-11-08. } [ Cryogenics ] A helium-3 refrigerator uses helium-3 to achieve temperatures of 0.2 to 0.3 kelvin. A dilution refrigerator uses a mixture of helium-3 and helium-4 to reach cryogenic temperatures as low as a few thousandths of a kelvin. { Dilution Refrigeration. cern.ch } An important property of helium-3, which distinguishes it from the more common helium-4, is that its nucleus is a fermion since it contains an odd number of spin 1/2 particles. Helium-4 nuclei are boson s, containing an even number of spin 1/2 particles. This is a direct result of the addition rules for quantized angular momentum. At low temperatures (about 2.17 K), helium-4 undergoes a phase transition : A fraction of it enters a superfluid phase that can be roughly understood as a type of Bose-Einstein condensate. Such a mechanism is not available for helium-3 atoms, which are fermions. However, it was widely speculated that helium-3 could also become a superfluid at much lower temperatures, if the atoms formed into pairs analogous to Cooper pair s in the BCS theory of superconductivity. Each Cooper pair, having integer spin, can be thought of as a boson. During the 1970s, David Lee, Douglas Osheroff and Robert Coleman Richardson discovered two phase transitions along the melting curve, which were soon realized to be the two superfluid phases of helium-3. [ Osheroff D. D. Richardson, R. C.; Lee, D. M. 1972 Evidence for a New Phase of Solid He 3 Physical Review Letters 28 14 885–888 10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.885 1972PhRvL..28..885O ] [ Osheroff D. D.

They were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. Tony Leggett won the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on refining understanding of the superfluid phase of helium-3. [ Leggett A. J. 1972 Interpretation of Recent Results on He 3 below 3 mK: A New Liquid Phase? Physical Review Letters 29 18 1227–1230 10.1103/PhysRevLett.29.1227 1972PhRvL..29.1227L ] In zero magnetic field, there are two distinct superfluid phases of 3 He, the A-phase and the B-phase. The B-phase is the low-temperature, low-pressure phase which has an isotropic energy gap. The A-phase is the higher temperature, higher pressure phase that is further stabilized by a magnetic field and has two point nodes in its gap. The presence of two phases is a clear indication that 3 He is an unconventional superfluid (superconductor), since the presence of two phases requires an additional symmetry, other than gauge symmetry, to be broken. In fact, it is a p-wave superfluid, with spin one, S=1, and angular momentum one, L=1. The ground state corresponds to total angular momentum zero, J=S+L=0 (vector addition). Excited states are possible with non-zero total angular momentum, J &gt; 0, which are excited pair collective modes. Because of the extreme purity of superfluid 3 He (since all materials except 4 He have solidified andsunk to the bottom of the liquid 3 He and any 4 He has phase separated entirely, this is the most pure condensed matter state), these collective modes have been studied with much greater precision than in any other unconventional pairing system. [ Medical lung imaging ] Helium-3 nuclei have an intrinsic nuclear spin of ½, and a relatively high magnetogyric ratio. Helium-3 can be hyperpolarized using non-equilibrium means such as spin-exchange optical pumping. [ Hyperpolarized 3He Gas Production and MR Imaging of the Lung Jason C. Leawoods Dmitriy A. Yablonskiy Brian Saam David S. Gierada Mark S. Conradi 2001 Concepts in Magnetic Resonance 13 277-293 ] During this process, circularly polarized infrared laser light, tuned to the appropriate wavelength, is used to excite electrons in an alkali metal, such as caesium or rubidium inside a sealed glass vessel. The angular momentum is transferred from the alkali metal electrons to the noble gas nuclei through collisions. In essence, this process effectively aligns the nuclear spins with the magnetic field in order to enhance the NMR signal. The hyperpolarized gas may then be stored at pressures of 10 atm, for up to 100 hours. Following inhalation, gas mixtures containing the hyperpolarized helium-3 gas can be imaged with an MRI scanner to produce anatomical and functional images of lung ventilation. This technique is also able to produce images of the airway tree, locate unventilated defects, measure the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, and measure the ventilation/perfusion ratio. This technique may be critical for the diagnosis and treatment management of chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and asthma.

Spectrum.ieee.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-08. } Helium-3 is naturally present in small quantities due to radioactive decay, but virtually all helium-3 used in industry is manufactured. Helium-3 is a product of tritium decay, and tritium can be produced through neutron bombardment of deuterium, lithium, boron, or nitrogen targets. Production of tritium in significant quantities requires the high neutron flux of a nuclear reactor; breeding tritium with lithium-6 consumes the neutron, while breeding with lithium-7 produces a low energy neutron as a replacement for the consumed fast neutron. Current supplies of helium-3 come, in part, from the dismantling of nuclear weapons where it accumulates, { Charmian Schaller Accelerator Production of Tritium – That Could Mean 40 Years of Work. Los Alamos Monitor. March 1, 1998 } { Science for Democratic Action Vol. 5 No. 1. IEER. Retrieved on 2011-11-08. } however the need for warhead disassembly is diminishing. Consequently tritium itself is in short supply, and the US Department of Energy recently began producing it by the lithium irradiation method at the Tennessee Valley Authority&apos;s Watts Bar reactor. Substantial quantities of tritium could also be extracted from the heavy water moderator in CANDU nuclear reactors. Production of helium-3 from tritium at a rate sufficient to meet world demand will require significant investment, as tritium must be produced at the same rate as helium-3, and approximately eighteen times as much tritium must be maintained in storage as the amount of helium-3 produced annually by decay (production rate dN/dt from number of moles or other unit mass of tritium N, is N γ = N ln 2/t ½ where the value of t ½ /(ln 2) is about 18 years; see radioactive decay ). If commercial fusion reactors were to use helium-3 as a fuel, they would require tens of tonnes of helium-3 each year to produce a fraction of the world&apos;s power, requiring substantial expansion of facilities for tritium production and storage. { Wittenberg 1994 } [ Abundance ] [ Solar nebula (primordial) abundance ] One early estimate of the primordial ratio of 3 He to 4 He in the solar nebula has been the measurement of their ratio in the atmosphere of Jupiter, measured by the mass spectrometer of the Galileo atmospheric entry probe.

This is roughly the same ratio of the isotopes in lunar regolith, when it contains 28  ppm helium-4 and 2.8  ppb helium-3 (which is at the lower end of actual sample measurements, which vary from about 1.4 to 15  ppb). However, terrestrial ratios of the isotopes are lower by a factor of 100, mainly due to enrichment of helium-4 stocks in the mantle by billions of years of alpha decay from uranium and thorium. [ Terrestrial abundance ] [ isotope geochemistry ] 3 He is a primordial substance in the Earth&apos;s mantle, considered to have become entrapped within the Earth during planetary formation. The ratio of 3 He to 4 He within the Earth&apos;s crust and mantle is less than that for assumptions of solar disk composition as obtained from meteorite and lunar samples, with terrestrial materials generally containing lower 3 He/ 4 He ratios due to ingrowth of 4 He from radioactive decay. 3 He is present within the mantle, in the ratio of 200–300 parts of 3 He to a million parts of 4 He. Ratios of 3 He/ 4 He in excess of atmospheric are indicative of a contribution of 3 He from the mantle. Crustal sources are dominated by the 4 He which is produced by the decay of radioactive elements in the crust and mantle. The ratio of Helium-3 to Helium-4 in natural Earth-bound sources varies greatly. { Aldrich, L.T.; Nier, Alfred O. Phys. Rev. 74, 1590 – 1594 (1948).

Similarly the US 2002 stockpile of 1 billion normal m 3 would have contained about 10 to 100 kilograms of helium-3. 3 He is also present in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. The natural abundance of 3 He in naturally occurring helium gas is 1.38 [ -6 ] (1.38 parts per million). The partial pressure of helium in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere is about 0.52 Pa, and thus helium accounts for 5.2 parts per million of the total pressure (101325 Pa) in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere, and 3 He thus accounts for 7.2 parts per trillion of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere of the Earth has a mass of about 5.14 [ 15 ] tonnes, { The Mass of the Atmosphere: A Constraint on Global Analyses. Ams.allenpress.com (1970-01-01). Retrieved on 2011-11-08. } the mass of 3 He in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere is the product of these numbers, or about 37,000 tonnes of 3 He. 3 He is produced on Earth from three sources: lithium spallation, cosmic rays, and beta decay of tritium ( 3 H). The contribution from cosmic rays is negligible within all except the oldest regolith materials, and lithium spallation reactions are a lesser contributor than the production of 4 He by alpha particle emissions. The total amount of helium-3 in the mantle may be in the range of 0.1–1 million tonne s. However, most of the mantle is not directly accessible. Some helium-3 leaks up through deep-sourced hotspot volcanoes such as those of the Hawaii an islands, but only 300  grams per year is emitted to the atmosphere. Mid-ocean ridge s emit another 3 kilogram per year. Around subduction zone s, various sources produce helium-3 in natural gas deposits which possibly contain a thousand tonnes of helium-3 (although there may be 25 thousand tonnes if all ancient subduction zones have such deposits). Wittenberg estimated that United States crustal natural gas sources may have only half a tonne total. { Wittenberg 1994 p. 3, Table 1; p. 9. } Wittenberg cited Anderson&apos;s estimate of another 1200 metric tonnes in interplanetary dust particles on the ocean floors. { Wittenberg 1994 Page A-1 citing Anderson 1993, &quot; 1200 metric tone &quot; } In the 1994 study, extracting helium-3 from these sources consumes more energy than fusion would release. { Wittenberg 1994 Page A-4 &quot; 1 kg (3He), pumping power would be 1.13 } [ 6 ] { MYyr... fusion power derived... 19 MWyr &quot; } Wittenberg also writes that extraction from US crustal natural gas, consumes ten times the energy available from fusion reactions. { Wittenberg 1994 Page A-4 using Table 1 page A-5 of US crustal natural gas } [ July 2008 ] [ Extraterrestrial supplies ] Materials on the Moon &apos;s surface contain helium-3 at concentrations on the order of between 1.4 and 15 ppb in sunlit areas, { FTI Research Projects :: 3He Lunar Mining.

Associated Press (via space.com). 26 January 2006 } if funding can be found.

Day The Space Review March 5, 2007 ] Mining gas giant s for helium-3 has also been proposed. [ Atmospheric Mining in the Outer Solar System Bryan Palaszewski http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2006/TM-2006-214122.pdf PDF ] { NASA Technical Memorandum 2006-214122. AIAA–2005–4319. Prepared for the 41st Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit cosponsored by AIAA, ASME, SAE, and ASEE, Tucson, Arizona, July 10–13, 2005. } The British Interplanetary Society &apos;s hypothetical Project Daedalus interstellar probe design was fueled by helium-3 mines in the atmosphere of Jupiter, for example. Jupiter&apos;s high gravity makes this a less energetically favorable operation than extracting helium-3 from the other gas giants of the solar system, however. [ Power generation ] A second-generation approach to controlled fusion power involves combining helium-3 ( 3 2 He) and deuterium ( 2 1 H ). This reaction produces a helium-4 ion ( 4 2 He ) (like an alpha particle, but of different origin) and a high-energy proton (positively charged hydrogen ion) ( 1 1 p). The most important potential advantage of this fusion reaction for power production as well as other applications lies in its compatibility with the use of electrostatic fields to control fuel ion s and the fusion protons. Protons, as positively charged particles, can be converted directly into electricity, through use of solid-state conversion materials as well as other techniques. Potential conversion efficiencies of 70% may be possible, as there is no need to convert proton energy to heat in order to drive a turbine -powered electrical generator [ April 2012 ]. There have been many claims about the capabilities of helium-3 power plants. According to proponents, fusion power plants operating on deuterium and helium-3 would offer lower capital and operating cost s than their competitors due to less technical complexity, higher conversion efficiency, smaller size, the absence of radioactive fuel, no air or water pollution, and only low-level radioactive waste disposal requirements. Recent estimates suggest that about $6 billion in investment capital will be required to develop and construct the first helium-3 fusion power plant. Financial breakeven at today&apos;s wholesale electricity prices (5 US cents per kilowatt-hour ) would occur after five 1- gigawatt plants were on line, replacing old conventional plants or meeting new demand.

The most advanced fusion programs in the world are inertial confinement fusion (such as National Ignition Facility ) and magnetic confinement fusion (such as ITER and other tokamak s ). In the case of the former, there is no solid roadmap to power generation. In the case of the latter, commercial power generation is not expected until around 2050. [ http://www.iter.org/proj/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx ITER &amp; Beyond 2009-08-04 ] In both cases, the type of fusion discussed is the simplest: D-T fusion. The reason for this is the very low Coulomb barrier for this reaction; for D+ 3 He, the barrier is much higher, and it is even higher for 3 He– 3 He. The immense cost of reactors like ITER and National Ignition Facility are largely due to their immense size, yet to scale up to higher plasma temperatures would require reactors far larger still. The 14.7 MeV proton and 3.6 MeV alpha particle from D– 3 He fusion, plus the higher conversion efficiency, means that more electricity is obtained per kilogram than with D-T fusion (17.6 MeV), but not that much more. As a further downside, the rates of reaction for helium-3 fusion reactions are not particularly high, requiring a reactor that is larger still or more reactors to produce the same amount of electricity. To attempt to work around this problem of massively large power plants that may not even be economical with D-T fusion, let alone the far more challenging D– 3 He fusion, a number of other reactors have been proposed  – the Fusor, Polywell, Focus fusion, and many more, though many of these concepts have fundamental problems with achieving a net energy gain, and generally attempt to achieve fusion in thermal disequilibrium, something that could potentially prove impossible, [ http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/29869 A general critique of inertial-electrostatic confinement fusion systems Todd Rider 2007-05-07 ] and consequently, these long-shot programs tend to have trouble garnering funding despite their low budgets. Unlike the &quot; big &quot;, &quot; hot &quot; fusion systems, however, if such systems were to work, they could scale to the higher barrier &quot; aneutronic &quot; fuels. However, these systems would scale well enough that their proponents tend to promote p-B fusion, which requires no exotic fuels like helium-3.
