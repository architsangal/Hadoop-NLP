It is the only major airport serving Sydney, and is a primary hub for Qantas, as well as a secondary hub for Virgin Australia and Jetstar Airways. Situated next to Botany Bay, the airport has three runways, colloquially known as the &quot; east–west &quot;, &quot; north–south &quot; and &quot; third &quot; runways. Sydney Airport is one of the oldest continually operated airports in the world, { Fact Sheet } [ February 2012 ] { Sydney Airport } and the busiest airport in Australia, handling 36  million passengers in 2010 { Passenger Traffic 2009 FINAL Airports Council International } and 289,741 aircraft movements in 2009. { Sydney Airport  – An Overview } [ February 2012 ] { Sydney Airport } It was the 27th busiest airport in the world in 2010. The airport is managed by Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) and the current CEO is Kerrie Mather. Flights from Sydney link with all states and territories of Australia. Currently 47 domestic destinations are served to Sydney direct. [ History ] [ Mascot, New South Wales#History ] [ 1920–30: Early history ] The area that the airport was situated was originally a bullock paddock. [ http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/bullock-paddock-grew-to-nations-busiest-air-hub/story-e6frg95x-1225799888484 Bullock paddock grew to nation&apos;s busiest air hub The Australian Steve Creedy 24 November 2009 News Corp 7 February 2010 ] Nigel Love, a former wartime pilot, was looking into the possibilities for aviation in Australia. He was interested in establishing the nation&apos;s first aircraft manufacturing company, this required him to establish a factory and an aerodrome close to the city. His search for a potential site eventually led him to a real estate office in Sydney which was aware of some land owned by the Kensington Race Club (that was kept as a hedge against losing its government-owned site at Randwick). It had been used by a local abattoir, which was closing down, to graze sheep and cattle. This land appealed to Love, the surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass. This grass which had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle running on it that it required little to make it serviceable to land aircraft. In addition, the approaches on all four sides had no obstructions, it was bounded by a racecourse, gardens, a river and Botany Bay. Love established Mascot as a private concern, leasing [ 200 acre km2 2 ] from the Kensington Race Club for three years. It initially had a small canvas structure but was later equipped with an imported Richards hangar. The first flight from Mascot was on 19 November 1919 when Love carried freelance movie photographer Billy Marshall up in an Avro. The official opening flight took place on 9 January 1920, also performed by Love. In 1921 the federal government purchased [ 161 acre km2 2 ] in Mascot for the purpose of creating a public airfield. In 1923, when Love&apos;s three-year lease expired, the Mascot land was compulsorily acquired by the federal government from the racing club. The first regular flights began in 1924. [ 1930–60 ] In 1933, the first gravel runways were built. Cooks River was diverted away from the area in 1947–52 to provide more land for the airport and other small streams were filled. When Mascot was declared an aerodrome in 1920 it was known as Sydney Airport, in 1953 it was renamed Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport [ March 2012 ] in honour of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, MC, AFC who was a pioneering Australian aviator. Up to the early sixties the majority of Sydney-siders referred to the airport as Mascot. The first paved runway was 07/25 and the next one constructed was 16/34 (now 16R/34L), jutting into Botany Bay, starting in 1959, to accommodate large jets. 07/25 is used mainly by lighter aircraft, although large four engine jet aircraft still periodically land on the runway from the east, when south-westerly winds are blowing in Sydney. 16R is presently the longest operational runway in Australia, with [ 14300 ft on ] paved length and [ 12850 ft on ] between the zebra thresholds. [ Modern history ] KLM DC8 at Gate 2 International Terminal in 1972 By the 1960s the need for a new international terminal had become apparent, and work commenced in late 1966. The new terminal was officially opened on 3 May 1970, by Queen Elizabeth II. The first Boeing 747 &quot; Jumbo Jet &quot; to serve the airport, Pan American&apos;s Clipper Flying Cloud (N734PA), arrived on 4 October 1970. In the 1970s the north-south runway was expanded to become one of the longest runways in the southern hemisphere. The international terminal was expanded in 1992 and has undergone several refurbishments since then. The limitations of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent and various governments grappled with Sydney&apos;s airport capacity for decades. Eventually, the controversial decision to build a third runway was made. The third runway was built parallel to the existing runway 18/36, entirely on reclaimed land from Botany Bay. A proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney was shelved indefinitely. [ Curfew ] Following completion, the &quot; third runway &quot; (as it is known to Sydneysiders) remained controversial because of increased aircraft movements, especially over many inner suburbs. The 1990s saw the formation of the No Aircraft Noise Party, although it failed to win a parliamentary seat in any of the elections it contested. There has been general acquiescence in the arrangements for Sydney Airport that were introduced by the Howard government shortly after its election, namely to maintain curfews between 11 pm and 6 am, rotate runway operation and fan flightpaths out, especially over water (especially Botany Bay) wherever possible and continue the use of noise abatement on aircraft on departure. In 1995 the Australian Government passed a law through parliament entitled &quot; The Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995 &quot; which limits the operating hours of the airport. This was done in an effort to curb complaints about aircraft noise. The curfew prevents aircraft from taking off or landing between the hours of 11pm and 6am. A limited number of scheduled and approved take-offs and landings are permitted respectively in the &quot; shoulder periods &quot; of 11pm to midnight and 5am to 6am, by Section 12 of the Act. The Act does not stop all aircraft movements overnight, but limits movements by restricting the types of aircraft that can operate, the runways they can use and the number of flights allowed. { Airport Curfews – General Information } During extreme weather, flights are often delayed and it is often the case that people on late flights are unable to travel on a given day. As of 2009 fines for violating curfew have been levied against four airlines, with a maximum fine of $550 000 applicable. [ Creedy Steve Jetstar fined for airport curfew breach http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0%2C28318%2C25436950-5014090%2C00.html 6 May 2009 31 May 2009 news.com.au News Limited ] In addition to the curfew. Sydney airport also has an 80 aircraft movements per hour cap { Sydney Airport Runway Movement Cap Report for December quarter 2010 } which cannot be exceeded, leading to increased delays during peak hours. [ Expansion ] { Royal Tongan Airlines } { Boeing 757-200 at Sydney Airport with the skyline of Sydney in the background (2004) } In 2002, the Australian Government sold Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (later renamed to Sydney Airport Corporation Limited, SACL), the management authority for the airport, to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd. 82.93 per cent of SACL is owned by MAp Airports International Limited, a subsidiary of Macquarie Bank, Sydney Airport Intervest GmbH own 12.11 per cent and Ontario Teachers&apos; Australia Trust own 4.96 per cent. [ http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Ownership.html Ownership Sydneyairport.com.au 26 October 2010 ] [ February 2012 ] SACL holds a 99 year lease on the airport which remains Crown land. Since the international terminal&apos;s original completion, it has undergone two large expansions. One such expansion is underway and will stretch over twenty years (2005–25). This will include an additional high-rise office block, the construction of a multi-level car park, the expansion of both international and domestic terminals. These expansions—and other plans and policies by Macquarie Bank for airport operations—are seen as controversial, as they are performed without the legal oversight of local councils, which usually act as the local planning authority for such developments. As of April 2006, some of the proposed development has been scaled back. { Sydney Morning Herald. 21 April 2006 issue } Sydney Airport&apos;s International terminal underwent a $500  million renovation that was completed in mid 2010. The upgrade includes a new baggage system, an extra [ 7300 m2 0 on ] of space for shops and passenger waiting areas and other improvements.

The report noted Sydney Airport recorded the highest average prices at $13.63 per passenger, compared to the lowest of $7.96 at Melbourne Airport, while the price of short-term parking had almost doubled in the 2008–09 financial year, from $28 to $50 for four hours. The report also accused the airport of abusing its monopoly power.

The current domestic Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 would be used by Qantas, Jetstar and members of the oneworld airline alliance while today&apos;s international Terminal 1 would be used by Virgin Australia and its international partners. Other international airlines would continue to operate from T1.

The International Terminal is separated from the other two by a runway, therefore connecting passengers need to allow for longer transfer times. Sydney Airport requires minimum connection times: From domestic flight to domestic flight: 30min From domestic flight to international flight: 1hour From international flight to domestic flight: 1hour 15min From international flight to international flight: 1hour The airport provides a shuttle service between the terminals at a cost of A$ 5.50. [ Terminal 1 ] Central International Concourse International Terminal landside Terminal 1 was opened on 3 May 1970, replacing the old Overseas Passenger Terminal (which was located where Terminal 3 stands now) and has been greatly expanded since then. Today it is known as the International Terminal, located in the airport&apos;s north western sector. It has 30 gates (Concourse B with 8–37 and Concourse C with 50–63) served by aerobridges, as well as a number of remote bays. It can accommodate the Airbus A380, which fly routes to Singapore (Singapore Airlines), London via Singapore and Los Angeles (Qantas), Dubai and Auckland (Emirates). The terminal building is split into three levels, one each for arrivals, departures and airline offices. The departure level has 20 rows of check-in desks each with 10 single desks making a total of 200 check-in desks. The terminal also has an observation deck located on the rooftop. The terminal hosts six airline lounges : Two for Qantas, and one each for Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines and Emirates. The terminal underwent a major $500  million redevelopment that was completed in 2010, by which the shopping complex was expanded, outbound customs operations were centralised and the floor space of the terminal increased to 254,000 square metres.

It features 15 parking bays served by aerobridges and a number of non-contact bays. Today it serves Virgin Australia, Jetstar, Tiger Airways, Regional Express Airlines, Aeropelican Air Services and Qantaslink services operated by Eastern Australia Airlines. There are lounges for Qantas, Virgin Australia and Regional Express Airlines. [ Terminal 3 ] Terminal 3 is a domestic terminal, serving Qantas and Qantaslink flights to Canberra. Originally, it was home for Trans Australia Airlines (later named Australian Airlines). Like Terminal 2 it is located in the north-eastern section. The current terminal building is largely the result of extensions made during the late 1990s. There are 14 parking bays served by aerobridges, including two served by dual aerobridges. Terminal 3 features a large Qantas Club lounge, along with a dedicated Business Class and Chairmans lounge. Terminal 3 also has a &apos;Heritage Collection&apos;, dedicated to Qantas, It includes Many collections from the Airlines&apos; 90 years of service, It also has a view of the airports apron and is used commonly by plane-spotters. It is located Adjacent Gate 13. [ Other terminals ] Sydney Airport had a fourth passenger terminal, east of Terminal 2. This was formerly known as Domestic Express and was used by Regional Express Airlines; and low-cost carriers Virgin Blue (now known as Virgin Australia) and the now-defunct Impulse Airlines; during the time Terminal 2 was closed following the collapse of Ansett Australia. It is now used by DHL Express and Tasman Cargo Airlines as an office building. The dedicated Freight Terminal is located north of Terminal 1. It is used for international freight operations, except for Tasman Cargo Airlines&apos; trans-Tasman services.

[ European carriers ] { Austrian Airlines } { Boeing 777-200ER at Sydney Airport in 2006 } In 1935, KLM was the first European airline to fly to Sydney, via its hub in Jakarta and over 20 other stops. They continued to serve Sydney up until early 2001. Many European carriers served Sydney including Lufthansa (Frankfurt), Air France (Paris), KLM (Amsterdam), Olympic (Athens), Austrian Airlines (Vienna), JAT (Belgrade) and Alitalia (Rome), among others. However, these airlines began finding it unprofitable to operate these long routes; and instead now codeshare. QF picked up many of these routes, but has since dropped all except London and Frankfurt. The last carrier to fly to Sydney was Austrian, leaving in early 2007. Gulf Air also flew to Sydney, but due to the distance between Sydney and Bahrain, dropped these flights for the same reason. The only European carriers to fly to Sydney as of 2012 are British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. Reunion-based Air Austral operates direct flights to Sydney from Paris. These flights originate from Nouméa which then fly to Sydney, Reunion and terminating at Paris.

In 1998 the airport handled 45 per cent of international passengers in Australia. [ Philip Laird Where We Are Now Back on Track UNSW Press 2001 29 0-86840-411-X ] The Federal Government has bought most of the required land in a proposed site at Badgerys Creek, west of Sydney. This site would be accessible by the Westlink M7 motorway. There are currently three proposals for the airport layout, featuring different arrangement of terminals in the centre of the proposed three runways. Despite acquiring almost all the land necessary for the building of the Badgerys Creek airport, and multiple studies and reports commissioned that recommend building the airport, in 1995 new airport leasing legislation was blocked in the Australian Senate, and construction was delayed until after the 2000 Sydney Olympics. All the major Australian airlines including Qantas indicated they would prefer additional development of Kingsford-Smith Airport. In 1998 most local authorities reversed their previous support of the new airport and protested against potential noise and pollution impacts. After the 2001 terrorist attacks decimated the air travel industry, the national government announced its belief that the current Sydney airport could accommodate additional air travel demands for at least another decade. Following this, the State Government released land for housing all across Badgerys Creek, effectively eliminating the site as a potential airport. Sydney Airport Carpark Complex International departures drop off area The issue of a second airport for Sydney arose again after the Rudd government was elected in 2007. Convinced that capacity at the current airport will be exhausted, it sought a new site. It is believed that various options, including a freight-only airport operation, will be considered.

[ Transport ] [ Rail ] T3 Airport Link Entrance The airport is accessible via the Airport Link underground rail line. The International railway station is located below the International terminal, while the Domestic railway station is located under the car park between the domestic terminals (Terminal 2 and Terminal 3). While the stations are part of the Cityrail suburban network, they are privately owned and operated by the Airport Link consortium. As a result passengers are required to pay a station access fee or &apos;gate fee&apos; of $11.80. This fee is added to the price of the distance based train ticket or paid for separately in the case of daily or weekly tickets.

Unlike special airport trains at other airports, these do not have special provisions for customers with luggage, do not operate express to the airport and may have all seats occupied by commuters before the trains arrive at the airport. [ Bus ] Sydney Buses operates Route 400 from Burwood to Bondi Junction railway stations and stops at the International and Domestic terminals. It connects the eastern suburbs, Inner West and St George areas to the airport.

[ Road ] Sydney Airport, being located within a dense urban area, has road connections in all directions. Southern Cross Drive ( M1 ), a motorway, is the fastest link with the city centre. The only other motorway, the M5 South Western Motorway (including the M5 East Freeway) links the airport with the south-western suburbs of Sydney. A ring road runs around the airport consisting of Airport Drive, Qantas Drive, General Holmes Drive, M5 East Freeway and Marsh Street. General Holmes Drive features a tunnel under the main north-south runway and three taxiways as well as providing access to an aircraft viewing area. Inside the airport a part-ring road  — Ross Smith Avenue (named after Ross MacPherson Smith )  — connects the Domestic Terminal with the control tower, the general aviation area, car-rental company storage yards, long-term car park, heliport, various retail operations and a hotel. A perimeter road runs inside the secured area for authorised vehicles only. The Airport runs several official car parks—Domestic Short Term, Domestic Remote Long Term, and International Short/Long Term.
