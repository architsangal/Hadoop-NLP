Sociology of sport, alternately referred to as sports sociology, is a sub-discipline of sociology which focuses on sport s as social phenomena. It is an area of study concerned with various socio-cultural structures, patterns, and organization s or groups involved with sport. There are many perspetives through which sport can be viewed. Therefore, very often some binary divisions are stressed, such as: professional — amateur, mass — top-level, active — passive/spectator, men — women, sports - play (as an antithesis to organized and institutionalized activity). Following feminist or other reflexive and tradition-breaking paradigms sports are sometimes studied as contested activities, i.e. as activities in the centre of various people/groups interests (connection of sports and gender, mass media, or state-politics). The emergence of the sociology of sport (though not the name itself) dates from the end of the 19th century, when first social psychological experiments dealing with group effects of competition and pace-making took place. Besides cultural anthropology and its interest in games in the human culture, one of the first efforts to think about sports in more general way was Johan Huizinga &apos;s &quot; Homo Ludens &quot; or Thorstein Veblen &apos;s &quot; Theory of the Leisure Class &quot;. { Lueschen, G. 1980.
