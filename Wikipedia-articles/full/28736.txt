Its value is 299,792,458 metres per second, a figure that is exact since the length of the metre is defined from this constant and the international standard for time. [ Penrose R 2004 The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe 410–1 Vintage Books 978-0-679-77631-4... the most accurate standard for the metre is conveniently definedso that there are exactly 299,792,458 of them to the distance travelled by light in a standard second, giving a value for the metre that very accurately matches the now inadequately precise standard metre rule in Paris. ] In imperial units this speed is approximately 186,282 miles per second. According to special relativity, c is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the universe can travel. It is the speed at which all massless particle s and associated fields (including electromagnetic radiation such as light ) travel in vacuum. It is also the speed of gravity (i.e. of gravitational wave s ) predicted by current theories. Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial frame of reference of the observer. In the Theory of Relativity, c interrelates space and time, and also appears in the famous equation of mass–energy equivalence E  =  mc 2. [ Uzan J-P Leclercq B 2008 The Natural Laws of the Universe: Understanding Fundamental Constants http://books.google.com/?id%3DdSAWX8TNpScC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA43 43–4 Springer 0-387-73454-6 ] The speed at which light propagates through transparent material s, such as glass or air, is less than c. The ratio between c and the speed v at which light travels in a material is called the refractive index n of the material (n  =  c  /  v). For example, for visible light the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at [ 200000 km/s ]; the refractive index of air for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about [ 90 km/s ] slower than c. In most practical cases, light can be thought of as moving &quot; instantaneously &quot;, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements the finite speed of light has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant space probes, it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft or vice versa. The light we see from stars left them many years ago, allowing us to study the history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computer s, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. Finally, the speed of light can be used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high precision. Ole Rømer first demonstrated in 1676 that light travelled at a finite speed (as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of Jupiter &apos;s moon Io. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave, and therefore travelled at the speed c appearing in his theory of electromagnetism. [ How is the speed of light measured? http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html ] In 1905, Albert Einstein postulated that the speed of light with respect to any inertial frame is independent of the motion of the light source, [ Einstein from &quot; B &quot; to &quot; Z &quot; – Volume 9 of Einstein studies JJ Stachel Springer 2002 0-8176-4143-2 226 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DOAsQ_hFjhrAC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA226 ] and explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the special theory of relativity and showing that the parameter c had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism. After centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be [ 299792458 m/s ] with a measurement uncertainty of 4 parts per billion. In 1983, the metre was redefined in the International System of Units (SI) as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in [ 299792458 ] of a second. As a result, the numerical value of c in metres per second is now fixed exactly by the definition of the metre. [ 112 ] [ Numerical value, notation, and units ] The speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by c, for &quot; constant &quot; or the Latin [ la celeritas ] (meaning &quot; swiftness &quot; ). Originally, the symbol V was used, introduced by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865. In 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch used c for a constant later shown to equal [ 2 ] times the speed of light in vacuum. In 1894, Paul Drude redefined c with its modern meaning. Einstein used V in his original German-language papers on special relativity in 1905, but in 1907 he switched to c, which by then had become the standard symbol.

It is only possible to verify experimentally that the two-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a mirror and back again) is frame-independent, because it is impossible to measure the one-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a distant detector) without some convention as to how clocks at the source and at the detector should be synchronized. However, by adopting Einstein synchronization for the clocks, the one-way speed of light becomes equal to the two-way speed of light by definition.

The factor  γ by which lengths contract and times dilate, is known as the Lorentz factor and is given by { (1 − v2 /c2 ) −1/2 }, where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower than  c, such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativity —but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as v approaches c. The results of special relativity can be summarized by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (with  c relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameter  c. [ Hartle JB 2003 Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein&apos;s General Relativity 52–9 Addison-Wesley 981-02-2749-3 ] Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameter  c is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts that  c is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves.

It is generally assumed that fundamental constants such as  c have the same value throughout spacetime, meaning that they do not depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that the speed of light may have changed over time. [ Ellis GFR Uzan J-P 2005 ‘c’ is the speed of light, isn’t it?

When v is zero, γ is equal to one, giving rise to the famous { mc2 } formula for mass-energy equivalence. Since the γ factor approaches infinity as v approaches  c, it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass. This is experimentally established in many tests of relativistic energy and momentum.

A point  B on the green x axis, to the left of  A, has zero ct, positive ct′, and negative ct′′. More generally, it is normally impossible for information or energy to travel faster than  c. One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as the relativity of simultaneity. If the spatial distance between two events  A and  B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied by  c then there are frames of reference in which  A precedes  B, others in which  B precedes  A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster than  c relative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and causality would be violated.

However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speed  c from the laser to the various positions of the spot.

However, this does not represent the speed of any single object as measured in a single inertial frame. Certain quantum effects appear to be transmitted instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum state s of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle&apos;s quantum state is observed, the other particle&apos;s quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, it is impossible to control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.

However, these jets are not moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.

The classical behaviour of the electromagnetic field is described by Maxwell&apos;s equations, which predict that the speed  c with which electromagnetic waves (such as light) propagate through the vacuum is related to the electric constant ε 0 and the magnetic constant μ 0 by the equation { 1/ } [ ε0 μ0 ]. [ Panofsky WKH Phillips M 1962 Classical Electricity and Magnetism Addison-Wesley 182 978-0-201-05702-7 ] In modern quantum physics, the electromagnetic field is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of the electromagnetic field, called photon s. In QED, photons are massless particle s and thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the speed of light in vacuum. Extensions of QED in which the photon has a mass have been considered. In such a theory, its speed would depend on its frequency, and the invariant speed  c of special relativity would then be the upper limit of the speed of light in vacuum.

The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency ) propagate is called the phase velocity  v p. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocity  v g, and its earliest part travels at the front velocity  v f. alt=A modulated wave moves from left to right. There are three points marked with a dot: A blue dot at a node of the carrier wave, a green dot at the maximum of the envelope, and a red dot at the front of the envelope. The phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of a refractive index. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of c to the phase velocity  v p in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light&apos;s frequency, intensity, polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003.

In exotic materials like Bose-Einstein condensates near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few meters per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as does all slower-than-c speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of this, light &quot; slowing &quot; in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a &quot; complete standstill &quot; by passing it through a Bose-Einstein Condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being &quot; stopped &quot; in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had &quot; stopped, &quot; it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which &quot; slow &quot; the speed of light.

In other materials, it is possible for the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative.

A pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various experiments.

It is impossible to transmit information with a light pulse any faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the front velocity ). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always equal to c. It is possible for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than c). When a charged particle does that in a dielectric material, the electromagnetic equivalent of a shock wave, known as Cherenkov radiation, is emitted. [ Cherenkov Pavel A.

In some cases, it is a hindrance: for example, c, being the upper limit of the speed with which signals can be sent, provides a theoretical upper limit for the operating speed of microprocessors. [ Parhami B 1999 Introduction to parallel processing: algorithms and architectures http://books.google.com/?id%3DekBsZkIYfUgC%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bq%3D 5 Plenum Press 978-0-306-45970-2 ] { and } [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dsona_r6dPyQC%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA26%26amp%3Bdq%3D%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA26#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Software Transactional Memories: An Approach for Multicore Programming D Imbs Michel Raynal 2009 10th International Conference, PaCT 2009, Novosibirsk, Russia, August 31 – September 4, 2009 Malyshkin, V Parallel Computing Technologies Springer 978-3-642-03274-5 26 ] On the other hand, some techniques depend on it, for example in distance measurements. Also, earth-based controllers must wait for round-trip communication lag that increases as spacecraft get farther away; NASA must wait several hours for information from a probe orbiting Jupiter, and if it needs to correct a navigation error, the fix will not arrive at the spacecraft for an equal amount of time, creating a risk of the correction not arriving in time. The speed of light is of relevance to communications. For example, given the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about [ 40,075 km ] and c about [ 300,000 km/s ], the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds. When light is travelling around the globe in an optical fibre, the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in an optical fibre, depending on its refractive index n. { A typical value for the refractive index of optical fibre is between 1.518 and 1.538: } [ Midwinter JE 1991 Optical Fibers for Transmission 2nd Krieger Publishing Company 0-89464-595-1 ] Furthermore, straight lines rarely occur in global communications situations, and delays are created when the signal passes through an electronic switch or signal regenerator. [ June 2007 Theoretical vs real-world speed limit of Ping http://royal.pingdom.com/2007/06/01/theoretical-vs-real-world-speed-limit-of-ping/ Royal Pingdom Pingdom 2010-05-05 ] A beam of light is depicted travelling between the Earth and the Moon in the time it takes a light pulse to move between them: 1.255 seconds at their mean orbital (surface-to-surface) distance. The relative sizes and separation of the Earth–Moon system are shown to scale. Another consequence of the finite speed of light is that communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications between ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three  seconds for the answer to arrive. [ http://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/15day4_orbits789.htm Day 4: Lunar Orbits 7, 8 and 9 The Apollo 8 Flight Journal NASA 2010-12-16 ] The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars. The speed of light can also be of concern over very short distances. In supercomputer s, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between processor s. If a processor operates at 1 gigahertz, a signal can only travel a maximum of about [ 30 cm ft 0 ] in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single chips. [ Distance measurement ] Radar systems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: the distance to the target is half the round-trip transit time multiplied by the speed of light. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver measures its distance to GPS satellites based on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver&apos;s position. Because light travels about 300,000 kilometres (186,000 miles) in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise. The Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, radar astronomy and the Deep Space Network determine distances to the Moon, [ Dickey JO et al.

[ Astronomy ] The finite speed of light is important in astronomy. Due to the vast distances involved, it can take a very long time for light to travel from its source to Earth. For example, it has taken 13  billion (13 [ 9 ] ) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. [ 5 January 2010 Hubble Reaches the &quot; Undiscovered Country &quot; of Primeval Galaxies http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/02/full/ Space Telescope Science Institute ] [ The Hubble Ultra Deep Field Lithograph http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/283957main_Hubble_Deep_Field_Lithograph.pdf PDF NASA 2010-02-04 ] Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they appeared 13  billion years ago, when the universe was less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself. Astronomical distances are sometimes expressed in light-year s, especially in popular science publications and media. [ The IAU and astronomical units http://www.iau.org/public/measuring/ International Astronomical Union 2010-10-11 ] A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, around 9461  billion kilometres, 5879  billion miles, or 0.3066 parsec s. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away. { Further discussion can be found at } [ 2000 StarChild Question of the Month for March 2000 http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html StarChild NASA 2009-08-22 ] [ Measurement ] { There are different ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε 0 and μ 0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c. } In 1983 the metre was defined as &quot; the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1⁄299,792,458 of a second &quot;, fixing the value of the speed of light at [ 299792458 m/s ] by definition, as described below. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of c. [ Astronomical measurements ] Outer space is a natural setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth&apos;s orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in astronomical unit s (AU) per day. An astronomical unit is approximately the average distance between the Earth and Sun; it is not based on the International System of Units.

Ole Christensen Rømer used an astronomical measurement to make the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light.

The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth&apos;s orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon&apos;s orbital period is actually the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter &apos;s innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth&apos;s orbit. alt=A star emits a light ray which hits the objective of a telescope. While the light travels down the telescope to its eyepiece, the telescope moves to the right. For the light to stay inside the telescope, the telescope must be tilted to the right, causing the distant source to appear at a different location to the right. Another method is to use the aberration of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. [ Bradley J 1729 Account of a new discoved Motion of the Fix&apos;d Stars http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark%3A/12148/bpt6k55840n.image.f375.langEN Philosophical Transactions 35 637–660 ] This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth&apos;s velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcsecond s ) [ Duffett-Smith P 1988 Practical Astronomy with your Calculator http://books.google.com/?id%3DDwJfCtzaVvYC 62 Cambridge University Press 0-521-35699-7 ] {, Extract of page 62 } it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth&apos;s velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be easily converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8  minutes 12  seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. Nowadays, the &quot; light time for unit distance &quot; —the inverse of  c, expressed in seconds per astronomical unit—is measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in the Solar System, with their position calculated from the gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many such measurements, a best fit value for the light time per unit distance is obtained. [ 2009 ], the best estimate, as approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), is: [ Pitjeva EV Standish EM 2009 Proposals for the masses of the three largest asteroids, the Moon-Earth mass ratio and the Astronomical Unit Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy 103 4 365–372 10.1007/s10569-009-9203-8 2009CeMDA.103..365P ] [ IAU Working Group on Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy IAU WG on NSFA Current Best Estimates http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/CBE.html US Naval Observatory 2009-09-25 ] [ 499.004783836 (10) s ] [ 0.00200398880410 (4) AU/s ] [ 173.144632674 (3) AU/day. ] light time for unit distance: c  =    =   The relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion (2 [ -11 ] ), equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of length by interferometry. [ NPL&apos;s Beginner&apos;s Guide to Length http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/posters/length/length-%28poster%29 UK National Physical Laboratory 2009-10-28 ] [ The value of the speed of light in astronomical units has a measurement uncertainty, unlike the value in SI units, because of the different definitions of the unit of length. Note ] Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light time for unit distance can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU in metres. [ Nevertheless, at this degree of precision, the effects of general relativity must be taken into consideration when interpreting the length. The metre is considered to be a unit of proper length, whereas the AU is usually used as a unit of observed length in a given frame of reference. The values cited here follow the latter convention, and are TDB -compatible. Note ] [ Time of flight techniques ] A method of measuring the speed of light is to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus developed by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault. { Fizeau apparatus } { alt=A light ray passes horizontally through a half-mirror and a rotating cog wheel, is reflected back by a mirror, passes through the cog wheel, and is reflected by the half-mirror into a monocular. } The setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror [ 8 km mi 0 ] away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated. [ Gibbs P 1997 How is the speed of light measured? http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html Usenet Physics FAQ University of California, Riverside 2010-01-13 ] The method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated. [ Fowler M The Speed of Light http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/spedlite.html University of Virginia 2010-04-21 ] Nowadays, using oscilloscopes with time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.

The vacuum permittivity may be determined by measuring the capacitance and dimensions of a capacitor, whereas the value of the vacuum permeability is fixed at exactly [ 4 π -7 H*m-1 ] through the definition of the ampere. Rosa and Dorsey used this method in 1907 to find a value of [ 299710 22 km/s ].

The value of c can then be found by using the relation c  =  fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith establish the frequency for a variety of normal mode s of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8  μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.

The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of the oven, typically 2450  MHz), the value of c can be calculated, &quot; often with less than 5% error &quot;.

By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equation  c  =  λf. Before the advent of laser technology, coherent radio sources were used for interferometry measurements of the speed of light.

The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry.

The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Muslim scholars and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation of the speed of light. Einstein&apos;s Theory of Special Relativity concluded that the speed of light is constant regardless of one&apos;s frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements. [ Early history ] Empedocles was the first to claim that light has a finite speed.

Based on that theory, Heron of Alexandria argued that the speed of light must be infinite because distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the eyes. Early Islamic philosophers initially agreed with the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory in favour of the now accepted intromission theory of vision, in which light moves from an object into the eye.

René Descartes argued that if the speed of light were finite, the Sun, Earth, and Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during a lunar eclipse. Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished. [ First measurement attempts ] In 1629, Isaac Beeckman proposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6  km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei proposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid.

The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microsecond s. alt=A diagram of a planet&apos;s orbit around the Sun and of a moon&apos;s orbit around another planet. The shadow of the latter planet is shaded. The first quantitative estimate of the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer&apos;s determination of the speed of light ). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter&apos;s innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth&apos;s orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth&apos;s orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of [ 220000 km/s ], 26% lower than the actual value. [ Huygens C 1690 Traitée de la Lumière French http://books.google.com/?id%3DNo8PAAAAQAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA9 8–9 Pierre van der Aa ] In his 1704 book Opticks, Isaac Newton reported Rømer&apos;s calculations of the finite speed of light and gave a value of &quot; seven or eight minutes &quot; for the time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value is 8  minutes 19  seconds). [ Newton I 1704 Prop. XI Optiks http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark%3A/12148/bpt6k3362k.image.f235.vignettesnaviguer ] { The text of Prop.  XI is identical between the first (1704) and second (1719) editions. } Newton queried whether Rømer&apos;s eclipse shadows were coloured; hearing that they were not, he concluded the different colours travelled at the same speed. In 1729, James Bradley discovered the aberration of light. From this effect he determined that light must travel 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8  minutes 12  seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. [ Connections with electromagnetism ] [ History of electromagnetic theory History of special relativity ] In the 19th century Hippolyte Fizeau developed a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of [ 315000 km/s ]. His method was improved upon by Léon Foucault who obtained a value of [ 298000 km/s ] in 1862. In the year 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/√ε 0 μ 0, by discharging a Leyden jar, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year Gustav Kirchhoff calculated that an electric signal in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at this speed.

It was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley in 1887. [ Michelson AA Morley EW 1887 On the Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether American Journal of Science 34 333–345 ] The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second. [ French AP 1983 Special relativity 51–57 Van Nostrand Reinhold 0-442-30782-9 ] Because of this experiment Hendrik Lorentz proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ( &quot; local time &quot; ), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz&apos;s aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz&apos;s theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz&apos;s aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity. [ Darrigol O 2000 Electrodynamics from Ampére to Einstein Clarendon Press 0-19-850594-9 ] [ Galison P Peter Galison 2003 Einstein&apos;s Clocks, Poincaré&apos;s Maps: Empires of Time W.W. Norton 0-393-32604-7 ] [ Special relativity ] In 1905 Einstein postulated from the outset that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.
