Native Americans are thought to have buried their dead in a mound structure approximately 1 mile north of Hume, although there is no evidence to support this claim. The first known white settler in the Hume area was Peter Duncan in 1835. The Bleeding Kansas affair and the upcoming Civil War brought John Brown, the famous liberator, to this area with an attack on the Lawrence farm, 5 miles south of Hume, in which slaves were freed. Border warfare fighting began soon after which cost many lives. The Civil War began in 1861, and within a 40-mile radius of Hume, two battles occurred. The battles were the Battle of Mine Creek and the Battle of Drywood Creek. The war came to a head when Order 11 was signed by Gen. Thomas Ewing and lead to a burning of settlements in the Hume area. { Mullies,William A.. Hume... Coal, Corn, and Cattle 1880-1980. 1 ed. HH Kesler. Kes-Print, 1980. } [ Hume&apos;s Early Period 1880-1930 ] It took many years after Order 11 for the Hume area to recover. A plat was drawn up by Leroy Taylor in 1880 for the town of Howard. Howard was not meant to be, due to the Post Office who had a town of Howard Mills, MO registered, and fearful of confusion, Howard had to change its name. The name, even today, is still debated upon. Tradition is that Hume got its name from a whiskey bottle falling off a train; however on Taylor&apos;s original plat, he had a Hume Street drawn on it. The population was about 1,000 at the beginning. { Orear,Lorinda. Bates County Sesquicentennial 1841-1991. 1 ed. Hume. Bates County Commemorative Book Committee. Butler, MO: Bates County Commemorative Book Committee, 1991. } Noah Little had to redraw Taylor&apos;s Plat and designed the town of Hume. Hume has many catalpa trees, due to a nurseryman in trouble for public intoxication who had to plant the trees as part of his punishment. Two railroads lines used to run through, now only one of these exists to this day. As for celebrations, the Hume Stock Show began in 1905, eventually the Hume Stock Show morphs into the Hume Fair, which exists today. Hume was known for being the White City on the Border due to local journalist Lewis Moore who advocated painting fences white in Hume. Many people did paint their fences white after this campaign. { Mullies } [ Hume Peak Coal Mining Period 1930-1950 ] Hume grew immensely due to the coal mining industry and the population peaked at nearly two thousand or more during at the height of coal production. The most prominent coal company in the area was the Hume Sinclair Coal Company. The first public water system was developed in the 1950s. Coal mining did not last past the 50&apos;s and with the loss of coal mines, businesses vanished and people left. [ Hume after Coal, Hume Bank Scandal ] The population of Hume reduced to under 200 by the early 1990s. The old Hume high school was demolished in May 1989 and a new high school wing added to the elementary was completed in 1991. In 2008, nearly a hundred FBI agents and agents of other US departments seized control of the Hume Bank following several claims of embezelment. During the course of three days, the agents siezed banking documents and closed operations of the Hume bank. Soon afterwards, Security Bank of neighboring town Rich Hill, Missouri assumed the insured deposits and re-opened the bank as a branch of Security Bank. The bank scandal in 2008 was completely caused by fiscal mismanagement and embezelment. In 2009, previous Hume Bank president, Jeffrey W. Thompson, 40, of Hume, Mo., plead guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah W. Hays to the charges of making false statements to the FDIC as part of a bank fraud scheme that caused such significant losses that the bank was pushed into insolvency. FDIC losses totalled $5,168,580 and total losses were over 6.6 million US dollars. Hume installed a new water system in 2009. In 2011 Thompson was sentenced to six years six months in Federal prison without the possibility of parole. { http://www.justice.gov/usao/mow/news2011/thompson.sen.html } [ References ] [ External links ] Historic maps of Hume in the Sanborn Maps of Missouri Collection at the University of Missouri Category:Cities in Bates County, Missouri ca:Hume (Missouri) es:Hume (Misuri) kk:Хюм (Миссури) ht:Hume, Missouri nl:Hume (Missouri) pt:Hume (Missouri) vo:Hume (Missouri)
