The population was 20,217 at the 2010 census. [ History ] [ Founding ] Soon after the establishment of a village in the Huntington area, English settlers sought to further expand their territory. On July 30, 1656, land was purchased from Chief Asharoken, head of the Matinecocks Native American tribe, part of which consisted of the land that is today known as East Northport.

The more populous settlement known as Larkfield was located on the northern side, near Vernon Valley (now part of Northport ). Larkfield originally developed near the location of Genola Cemetery, just north of the modern-day junction of Larkfield Road, Vernon Valley Road, and Laurel Road. A second community located on the southern side was known as Clay Pitts, named for its vast deposits of red clay. This clay which had been used by Native Americans to form pottery was used by the Europeans to form bricks for construction.

[ East Northport ] In 1868 the Long Island Railroad opened a station within the village of Northport. [ PRR Chronology, 1868 The Pennsylvania Railroad Technical &amp; Historical Society June 2004 http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1868%20June%2004.wd.pdf PDF 2007-02-12 ] However, just a few years later the LIRR decided to move the Northport station to a new location in Larkfield to facilitate further railway extension to Port Jefferson. The new railway station located at Larkfield Road and Bellerose Avenue opened on January 13, 1873. [ PRR Chronology, 1873 The Pennsylvania Railroad Technical &amp; Historical Society February 2005 http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1873%20Feb%2004.pdf PDF 2007-02-12 ] Although the station retained the name of Northport, train conductors would refer to it as &quot; East of Northport &quot; because the station was located east of the railway junction which used to direct trains north to the old station located in the village of Northport. Despite the fact that East Northport is primarily south of Northport, the area became known thereafter as East Northport. The Larkfield Post Office formally changed its name to East Northport in 1910.
