The Trillium Award is given annually by the government of the Province of Ontario and is open to books in any genre: fiction, non-fiction, drama, children&apos;s books, and poetry. Anthologies, new editions, re-issues and translations are not eligible. Three jury members per language judge the submissions, select the shortlist and the winning title. The jury is composed of writers and other members of the literary community. Canadian citizens and landed immigrants who have lived in Ontario for at least three out of the past five years and who have been published anywhere in the world are eligible. Their publishers are invited to submit titles to the Ministry of Culture for consideration. In 1993 the award was expanded by Premier Bob Rae &apos;s government to also include a French language category; [ http://walrusmagazine.com/trillium/ Trillium Book Award The Walrus 2012-0529 ] it was first awarded in 1994. In 2003, English and French poetry categories were added to the awards. The following year, there were not enough French poetry submissions to present an award; accordingly, the French award is currently divided into poetry and children&apos;s literature awards presented in alternating years, with each award having an eligibility period of two years rather than one. The English poetry award continues to be presented yearly, and an English children&apos;s literature award is not presented; however, English children&apos;s books are eligible to be nominated for the English fiction award.
