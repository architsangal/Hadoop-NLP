Shout Factory, 2005. } Coyne earned money in high school as a fry cook for a Long John Silver&apos;s restaurant in Oklahoma City. During his second year of employment there was a rash of robberies in Oklahoma City. The restaurant was robbed and Coyne and other employees were held at gunpoint and forced to lie on the ground.

Coyne believes &quot; this is really how you die...one minute you&apos;re just cooking up someone&apos;s order of french fries and the next minute you&apos;re laying on the floor and they blow your brains out. There&apos;s no music, there&apos;s no significance, it&apos;s just random. &quot; [ With the Flaming Lips ] { Lollapalooza, 2006 Grant Park, } { Chicago } Coyne formed the Flaming Lips in 1983 with brother Mark singing lead and Michael Ivins on bass guitar. Mark later left the band and Coyne assumed vocal duties. Both Wayne and Michael have been the only two consistent members of the band since its founding.

Coyne has also been known to pour fake blood down his face via a hidden tube during live shows.

Their performances have been likened to psychedelic experience s rather than something so benign as music shows, a tradition that goes back to the band&apos;s formation. [ Experimental art ] In 1996 and 1997, Coyne developed “The Parking Lot Experiments,” where forty different tapes were distributed. The band instructed forty cars to start the tapes at the same time, resulting in a surround sound. Over 1,000 people gathered in a parking lot for this experiment. The parking lot experiments led to the experimental album Zaireeka, which is made up of four stereo tracks, each on four different CDs. The four CDs are meant to be played simultaneously in order to hear the complete tracks. Coyne believes Zaireeka embraces &quot;...a kind of anarchy in art. It was like an art happening – you have to bring four sound systems together. Sometimes you get great synchronicity; other times, it sounds haphazard. You get to hear music in a whole new way. &quot; { Jonathan Takiff.. &quot; All about the Flaming Lips, straight from the psychedelic mouth of Wayne Coyne. &quot; McClatchy – Tribune Business News 23 May 2008 } At the New Year&apos;s Eve Freakout in Oklahoma City on January 1, 2010, Coyne instructed the audience to set their cell phone alarms for 12:55 a.m. When the alarms went off, the alarm sounds were drowned out by cheering.

It has a picture of a skull drawn in a Wes Wilson style, Coyne printed it using his blood collected in a vial. The print will soon go on auction.

It was a low budget project and principal photography was shot on a set in his backyard. The different parts of the spaceship set were built by Coyne. The film tells the story of the first Christmas on a colonized Mars. In the film, Coyne plays a super-being who is curious about a baby being born on Mars. &quot; Christmas on Mars &quot; was shown for the first time at the Sasquatch! Music Festival in a circus tent. The Flaming Lips took the tent with them on tour, showing the movie after each performance. &quot; The concept was to come up with another one of those midnight movies, like &apos;The Rocky Horror Picture Show,&apos; that I went to see as a teenager, all toked up, before the days of cable. &quot; [ Other projects/appearances ] Wayne Coyne in Brighton Centre, UK in 2003 [ http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1532605/20060526/flaming_lips.jhtml Flaming Lips&apos; Wayne Coyne Delivers Bizarre High School Graduation Address 2007-02-12 James Montgomery 2006-05-26 MTV.com ] Bradley Beesley directed a 2005 film about Coyne and the Flaming Lips, The Fearless Freaks, which features much footage of Coyne&apos;s early life, as well as his narration about his experiences in the band.
