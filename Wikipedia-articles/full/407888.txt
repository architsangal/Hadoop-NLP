[ Early political career ] At 28 years old, Rogers became the youngest person and first Republican to join the Calhoun County Commission. While serving on the Commission and working for the United Way, Rogers enrolled at the Birmingham School of Law along with his wife, Beth, and upon graduating with honors began a general law practice in Anniston. Three years later he started his own firm, which grew to become Anniston&apos;s largest. [ June 2008 ] In 1994 he won a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives, and became Minority leader in his second term there. In 2002, Bob Riley successfully ran for governor, leaving the 3rd district vacant. Democrats had reapportioned the seat and the black population of the district had increased from 25% to 32% as a result. Rogers easily won the Republican nomination. In the general election, he faced Democratic veteran Joe Turnham, Jr., who had served three years as state party chairman and had run against Riley in the congressional election in 1998. { &quot; Riley a Rerun in U.S. House, &quot; The Anniston Star, November 4, 1998, p. 1A } [ U.S. House of Representatives ] Earlier photo of Rogers [ Committees ] Subcommittee on Readiness Subcommittee on Strategic Forces { Committee on Homeland Security } Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security (Chairman) Republican Study Committee [ Political positions ] Except on spending, where he earned the dubious title of &quot; April 2012 Porker of the Month &quot; and only a 23% rating from Citizens Against Government Waste { Citizens Against Government Waste: Scorecard } Rogers has a solidly conservative voting record [ August 2010 ].
