It is one of the four chloromethanes. The colorless, sweet-smelling, dense liquid is a trihalomethane, and is considered somewhat hazardous. Several million tons are produced annually as a precursor to Teflon and refrigerants, but its use for refrigerants is being phased out. { M. Rossberg et al. “Chlorinated Hydrocarbons” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. } [ 10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2 ] [ Occurrence ] Chloroform has a multitude of natural sources, both biogenic and abiotic. It is estimated that greater than 90% of atmospheric chloroform is of natural origin. { http://www.eurochlor.org/upload/documents/document56.pdf } [ Marine ] In particular, chloroform is produced by brown seaweeds ( Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina, Fucus serratus, Pelvetia canaliculata, Ascophyllum nodosum ), red seaweeds (Gigartina stellata, Corallina officinalis, Polysiphonia lanosa), and green seaweeds ( Ulva lactuca, Enteromorpha sp., Cladophora albida). [ Nightingale PB, Malin G, Liss PS 1995 Production of Chloroform and Other Low- Molecular-Weight Halocarbons by Some Species of Macroalgae Limnology and Oceanography 40 680 4 American Society of Limnology and Oceanography 2838303 ] Similarly, the macroalga Eucheuma denticulatum, which is cultivated and harvested on a large scale for carrageenan production, produces chloroform, [ 10.1080/09670269600651241 Stress-induced production of volatile halogenated organic compounds in Eucheuma denticulatum (Rhodophyta) caused by elevated pH and high light intensities 1996 Mtolera Matern Collén Jonas Pedersén Marianne Ekdahl Anja Abrahamsson Katarina Semesi Adelaida European Journal of Phycology 31 1 89 ] as do Hypnea spinella, Falkenbergia hillebrandii, and Gracilara cornea along with seven indigenous macroalgae inhabiting a rock pool. [ Ekdahl A, Pedersen M, Abrahamsson K 1998 A Study of the Diurnal Variation of Biogenic Volatile Halocarbons Mar Chem 63 1 ] These studies show increased chloroform production with increased light intensity, presumably when photosynthesis is at a maximum. Chloroform is also produced by the brown algae Fucus vesiculosus, the green algae Cladophora glomerata, Enteromorpha ahlneriana, Enteromorpha flexuosa, and Enteromorpha intestinalis, and the diatom Pleurosira laevis.

Chloroform was reported in 1831 by the French chemist Eugène Soubeiran, who prepared it from acetone (2-propanone) as well as ethanol through the action of chlorine bleach powder ( calcium hypochlorite ). [ Eugène Soubeiran Ann. Chim. 48 131 1831 ] The American physician Samuel Guthrie prepared gallons of the material and described its &quot; deliciousness of flavor. &quot; [ Samuel Guthrie New mode of preparing a spirituous solution of Chloric Ether Am. J. Sci. And Arts 21 64 1832 Samuel Guthrie (U.S. physician) ] Independently, Justus von Liebig also described the same compound. [ Justus Liebig Ueber die Verbindungen, welche durch die Einwirkung des Chlors auf Alkohol, Aether, ölbildendes Gas und Essiggeist entstehen Annalen der Pharmacie 1 2 182–230 1832 10.1002/jlac.18320010203 ] All early preparations used variations of the haloform reaction. Chloroform was named and chemically characterized in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas. [ Jean-Baptiste Dumas Untersuchung über die Wirkung des Chlors auf den Alkohol Annalen der Pharmacie 107 41 650–656 1834 10.1002/andp.18341074103 ] [ Industrial routes ] In industry, chloroform is produced by heating a mixture of chlorine and either chloromethane or methane. At 400–500 °C, a free radical halogenation occurs, converting these precursors to progressively more chlorinated compounds: CH 4 + Cl 2 → CH 3 Cl + HCl CH 3 Cl + Cl 2 → CH 2 Cl 2 + HCl CH 2 Cl 2 + Cl 2 → CHCl 3 + HCl Chloroform undergoes further chlorination to yield carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ): CHCl 3 + Cl 2 → CCl 4 + HCl The output of this process is a mixture of the four chloromethanes (chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride), which can then be separated by distillation. [ Deuterochloroform ] [ Deuterated chloroform ] Deuterated chloroform is an isotopologue of chloroform with a single deuterium atom. CDCl 3 is a common solvent used in NMR Spectroscopy. Deuterochloroform is produced by the haloform reaction [ February 2012 ], the reaction of acetone (or ethanol) with sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite. The haloform process is now obsolete for the production of ordinary chloroform. Deuterochloroform can also be prepared by the reaction of sodium deuteroxide with chloral hydrate, [ December 2007 ] or from ordinary chloroform. { Canadian Patent 1085423 } [ Inadvertent formation of chloroform ] The haloform reaction can also occur inadvertently in domestic settings. [ June 2011 ] Sodium hypochlorite solution ( chlorine bleach ) mixed with common household liquids such as acetone, butanone, ethanol, or isopropyl alcohol can produce some chloroform, in addition to other compounds such as chloroacetone or dichloroacetone. [ June 2011 ] [ Uses ] The major use of chloroform today is in the production of the chlorodifluoromethane (R-22), a major precursor to tetrafluoroethylene : CHCl 3 + 2 HF → CHClF 2 + 2 HCl The reaction is conducted in the presence of a catalytic amount of antimony pentafluoride. Chlorodifluoromethane is then converted into tetrafluoroethylene, the main precursor to Teflon. Before the Montreal Protocol, chlorodifluoromethane (R22) was also a popular refrigerant. [ As a solvent ] Chloroform is a common solvent in the laboratory because it is relatively unreactive, miscible with most organic liquids, and conveniently volatile. Chloroform is used as a solvent in the pharmaceutical industry and for producing dye s and pesticide s. Chloroform is an effective solvent for alkaloid s in their base form and thus plant material is commonly extracted with chloroform for pharmaceutical processing. For example, it is used in commerce to extract morphine from poppies and scopolamine from Datura plants. It can be used to bond pieces of acrylic glass (also known under the trade names Perspex and Plexiglas). A solvent of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1 is used to dissolve non-nucleic acid biomolecules in DNA and RNA extractions. Chloroform containing deuterium (heavy hydrogen), CDCl 3, is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy. [ As a reagent in organic synthesis ] As a reagent, chloroform serves as a source of the dichlorocarbene CCl 2 group. { Srebnik, M.; Laloë, E. &quot; Chloroform &quot; Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis &quot; 2001 John Wiley. } [ 10.1002/047084289X.rc105 ] It reacts with aqueous sodium hydroxide usually in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst to produce dichlorocarbene, CCl 2. [ Vogel, E.; Klug, W.; Breuer. A. 1,6-Methano[10]annulene 6 731 1988 cv6p0731 ] [ Gokel, G. W.; Widera, R. P.; Weber, W. P. Phase-Transfer Hofmann Carbylamine Reaction: tert-Butyl Isocyanide 6 232 1988 cv6p0232 ] This reagent affects ortho-formylation of activated aromatic rings such as phenols, producing aryl aldehyde s in a reaction known as the Reimer-Tiemann reaction. Alternatively the carbene can be trapped by an alkene to form a cyclopropane derivative. In the Kharasch addition chloroform forms the CHCl 2 free radical in addition to alkenes. [ As an anesthetic ] Antique bottles of Chloroform Chloroform was once a widely used anesthetic. Its vapor depresses the central nervous system of a patient, allowing a doctor to perform various otherwise painful procedures. On 4 November 1847, the Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson discovered the anaethestic qualities of chloroform when he and his friends were experimenting with different substances on themselves in search of a replacement for ether as a general anesthesia. He was so astounded by the success of his own trial that the next morning he hired a chemist and within the next few days was administering it to his patients during childbirth. [ Gordon H. Laing Sir James Young Simpson and Chloroform (1811-1870) http://books.google.com/books?id%3DpYer05UwKBYC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA106 11 November 2011 2002-11 The Minerva Group, Inc. 978-1-4102-0291-8 106–109 ] The use of chloroform during surgery expanded rapidly thereafter in Europe. In the 1850s, chloroform was used during the birth of Queen Victoria&apos;s last two children. { Anesthesia and Queen Victoria } In the United States, chloroform began to replace ether as an anesthetic at the beginning of the 20th century; however, it was quickly abandoned in favor of ether upon discovery of its toxicity, especially its tendency to cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia analogous to what is now termed &quot; sudden sniffer&apos;s death &quot;. Ether is still the preferred anesthetic in some developing nation s due to its high therapeutic index, and low price. One possible mechanism of action for chloroform is that it increases movement of potassium ions through certain types of potassium channels in nerve cells. [ Patel Amanda J. Honoré Eric Lesage Florian Fink Michel Romey Georges Lazdunski Michel May 1999 Inhalational anesthetics activate two-pore-domain background K+ channels Nature Neuroscience 2 422–426 10.1038/8084 10321245 5 Honoré Lesage Fink Romey Lazdunski ] Chloroform could also be mixed with other anaesthetic agents such as ether to make C.E. mixture, or ether and alcohol to make A.C.E. mixture. Chloroform has been used by criminals to knock out, daze or even murder their victims. Joseph Harris was charged with using chloroform in 1894 to rob people.

[ http://www.wlwt.com/news/14519857/detail.html Man Uses Chloroform In Sex Attacks Of Teens 6 November 2007 31 March 2011 News 5 ] [ http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-11-06-chloroform-rapes_N.htm Man admits to raping friends&apos; daughters 6 November 2007 31 March 2011 USA Today ] [ Safety ] Fatal oral dose of chloroform may be as low as 10 mL (14.8 g), with death due to respiratory or cardiac arrest. { Chloroform, US Environmental Potection Agency } As might be expected for an anesthetic, chloroform vapors depress the central nervous system. It is immediately dangerous to life and health at approximately 500 ppm, according to the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Breathing about 900 ppm for a short time can cause dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure can damage the liver (where chloroform is metabolized to phosgene ) and the kidney s, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in chloroform. Animal studies have shown that miscarriage s occur in rat s and mice that have breathed air containing 30 to 300 ppm of chloroform during pregnancy and also in rats that have ingested chloroform during pregnancy. Offspring of rats and mice that breathed chloroform during pregnancy have a higher incidence of birth defect s, and abnormal sperm have been found in male mice that have breathed air containing 400 ppm chloroform for a few days. The effect of chloroform on reproduction in humans is unknown. Chloroform once appeared in toothpaste s, cough syrup s, ointment s, and other pharmaceutical s, but it has been banned as a consumer product in the US since 1976. [ The National Toxicology Program: Substance Profiles: Chloroform CAS No. 67-66-3 http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/Chloroform.pdf pdf 2012-05-21 ] Cough syrups containing chloroform can still be legally purchased in pharmacies and supermarkets in the UK. The US National Toxicology Program&apos;s twelfth report on carcinogens [ Substances Listed in the Twelfth Report on Carcinogens http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/ListedSubstancesReasonablyAnticipated.pdf pdf 2012-05-21 ] implicates it as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen, a designation equivalent to International Agency for Research on Cancer class 2A. The IARC itself classifies chloroform as possibly carcinogenic to humans, a Group 2B designation. [ International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - Summaries &amp; Evaluations: Chloroform http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol73/73-05.html 2010-09-02 ] It has been most readily associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. [ http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/1970/78127_9.html Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Current Intelligence Bulletin 9 ] [ National Toxicology Program: Report on the carcinogenesis bioassay of chloroform http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/LT_rpts/trChloroform.pdf ] Caution is mandated during its handling in order to minimize unnecessary exposure; safer alternatives, such as dichloromethane, have resulted in a substantial reduction of its use as a solvent. [ Conversion to phosgene ] During prolonged storage in the presence of oxygen chloroform converts slowly to phosgene. To prevent accidents, commercial chloroform is stabilized with ethanol or amylene, but samples that have been recovered or dried no longer contain any stabilizer. Amylene has been found ineffective, and the phosgene can affect analytes in samples, lipids, and nucleic acids dissolved in or extracted with chloroform. { (Turk, Eric, &quot; Phosgene from Chloroform &quot;, Chemical &amp; Engineering News (2 March 1998) Vol. 76, No. 9, pp.  6.) } Dissolved phosgene cannot be removed by distillation or carbon filters, but it is removed by calcium hydroxide or activated alumina. { (Cone, Edward J., William F. Buckwald, and William D. Darwin, &quot; Analytical controls in Drug Metabolic Studies, II Artifact formation During Chloroform Extraction of Drugs and Metabolites with Amine Substituents &quot;,Drug Metabolism &amp; Disposition November 1982 vol. 10 no. 6 561-567) } Suspected samples can be tested for phosgene using filter paper (treated with 5% diphenylamine, 5% dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in alcohol, and then dried), which turns yellow in phosgene vapor. There are several colorimetric and fluorometric reagents for phosgene, and it can also be quantified with mass spectrometry.
