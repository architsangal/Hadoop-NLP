It occurs naturally in many plants, particularly grape s, banana s, and tamarind s; is commonly combined with baking soda to function as a leavening agent in recipes, and is one of the main acids found in wine. It is added to other foods to give a sour taste, and is used as an antioxidant. Salts of tartaric acid are known as tartrate s. It is a di hydroxyl derivative of succinic acid. Tartaric acid was first isolated from potassium tartrate, known to the ancients as tartar, c. 800 by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan.

Tartaric acid played an important role in the discovery of chemical chirality. This property of tartaric acid was first observed in 1832 by Jean Baptiste Biot, who observed its ability to rotate polarized light. Louis Pasteur continued this research in 1847 by investigating the shapes of ammonium sodium tartrate crystals, which he found to be chiral. By manually sorting the differently shaped crystals under magnification, Pasteur was the first to produce a pure sample of levotartaric acid. { L.

It is a useful raw material in organic chemistry for the synthesis of other chiral molecules. The naturally occurring form of the acid is L-(+)-tartaric  acid or dextrotartaric  acid.The mirror-image (enantiomeric) form, levotartaric  acid or D-(−)-tartaric  acid, and the achiral form, mesotartaric  acid, can be made artificially. Note, that the dextro and levo prefixes are not related to the D/L configuration (which is derived rather indirectly { J. M. McBride&apos;s Yale lecture on history of stereochemistry of tartaric acid, the D/L and R/S systems } from their structural relation to D - or L - glyceraldehyde ), but to the orientation of the optical rotation, (+) = dextrorotatory, (−) = levorotatory. Sometimes, instead of capital letters, small italic d and l are used. They are abbreviations of dextro- and levo- and, nowadays, should not be used. Levotartaric and dextrotartaric acid are enantiomer s, mesotartaric acid is a diastereomer of both of them.

It is distinct from mesotartaric acid and was calledracemic  acid (from Latin racemus – &quot; a bunch of grapes &quot; ). The word racemic later changed its meaning, becoming a general term for 1:1 enantiomeric mixtures – racemate s. Tartaric acid is used to prevent copper(II) ions from reacting with the hydroxide ions present in the preparation of copper(I) oxide. Copper(I) oxide is a reddish brown solid, and is produced by the reduction of a Cu(II) salt with an aldehyde, in an alkaline solution. levotartaric acid (D-(−)-tartaric acid) dextrotartaric acid (L-(+)-tartaric acid) mesotartaric acid File:D-tartaric acid.png File:L-tartaric acid.png 150 px DL -tartaric acid (racemic acid) (when in 1:1 ratio) [ 875 ] [ 439655 ] [ 444305 ] [ 78956 ] [ 5851 ] [ 205-695-6 ] [ 201-766-0 ] [ 205-696-1 ] [ 205-105-7 ] colspan=7| Forms of tartaric acid Common name tartaric acid levotartaric acid dextrotartaric acid mesotartaric acid racemic acid Synonyms D -(S,S)-(−)-tartaric acid unnatural isomer L -(R,R)-(+)-tartaric acid natural isomer (2R,3S)-tartaric acid DL -(S,S/R,R)-(±)-tartaric acid PubChem EINECS number CAS number 526-83-0 147-71-7 87-69-4 147-73-9 133-37-9 [ Derivatives ] Tartar emetic Commercially produced tartaric acid.

Tartaric acid is a muscle toxin, which works by inhibiting the production of malic acid, and in high doses causes paralysis and death.

As a food additive, tartaric acid is used as an antioxidant with E number E334, tartrate s are other additives serving as antioxidants or emulsifier s. When cream of tartar is added to water, a suspension results which serves to clean copper coin s very well, as the tartrate solution can dissolve the layer of copper(II) oxide present on the surface of the coin. The resulting copper(II)-tartrate complex is easily soluble in water. [ Tartaric acid in wine ] [ Acids in wine ] Unpurified potassium bitartarate, separated from grape juice, can take on the color of the grape juice. Tartaric acid may be most immediately recognizable to wine drinkers as the source of &quot; wine diamonds &quot;, the small potassium bitartrate crystals that sometimes form spontaneously on the cork. These &quot; tartrates &quot; are harmless, despite sometimes being mistaken for broken glass, and are prevented in many wines through cold stabilization. The tartrates that remain on the inside of aging barrel s were at one time a major industrial source of potassium bitartrate. However, tartaric acid plays an important role chemically, lowering the pH of fermenting &quot; must &quot; to a level where many undesirable spoilage bacteria cannot live, and acting as a preservative after fermentation. In the mouth, tartaric acid provides some of the tartness in the wine, although citric and malic acid s also play a role.
