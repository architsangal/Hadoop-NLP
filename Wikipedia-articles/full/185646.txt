They built a castle there whose remains can still be visited and are occasionally used for public celebrations. It was completely destroyed in the Seven years war in 1769. In the 12th century, old Arnsberg became the seat of Westphalia n jurisdiction (whose coat of arms is up to the present still used by the Hochsauerlandkreis ). Later, the city lost its independence and belonged to the Cologne area when their archbishops reigned the area. In 1816, it came under Prussia n rule and was made a local administrative centre. The current city of Arnsberg was created in 1975 by merging 14 cities and municipalities into one city. Old Arnsberg itself and Neheim-Hüsten are the two urban parts, while the other parts are very rural. Neheim and Hüsten had been merged in 1941. In the Second World War, Arnsberg first suffered widespread destruction and catastrophic loss of lives when British bombardment breached the dam of the Möhnesee reservoir in the night from 16 to 17 May 1943 ( Operation Chastise ). The nearby Abbey Himmelpforten was completely washed away. Later, dozens of Arnsberg citizens were killed in several British air raids aimed at destroying the railway viaduct. The targets were finally destroyed on March 19, 1945 using a Grand Slam bomb. Also see: Möhne Reservoir.
