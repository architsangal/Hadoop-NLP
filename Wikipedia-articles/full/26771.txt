The Spindletop dome was derived from the Louann Salt evaporite layer of the Jurassic geologic period. { Hyne, Norman J., Nontechnical guide to petroleum geology, exploration, drilling, and production, Pennwell Books, 2nd ed. p. 193 ISBN 978-0-87814-823-3 } On January 10, 1901, a well at Spindletop struck oil ( &quot; came in &quot; ). The new oil field soon produced more than [ 100000 oilbbl m3 ] of oil per day. [ Spindletop Oilfield SS/dos3 Wooster, Robert; Sanders, Christine Moor October 18, 2009 ] {, Texas State Historical Association } Gulf Oil and Texaco, now part of Chevron Corporation, were formed to develop production at Spindletop. { Daniel Yergin, The Prize, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991, pp.75–78. } The strike at Spindletop represented a turning point for Texas and the United States; no oil field in the world had ever been so productive. The frenzy of oil exploration and the economic development it generated in the state became known as the Texas Oil Boom. The United States soon became the world&apos;s leading oil producer. { TOC } [ History ] There had long been suspicions that oil might be under &quot; Spindletop Hill. &quot; The area was known for its vast sulfur springs and bubbling gas seepages that would ignite if lit. In August 1892, George W. O&apos;Brien, George W. Carroll, Pattillo Higgins and others formed the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company to do exploratory drilling on Spindletop Hill. The company drilled many dry holes and ran into trouble, as investors began to balk at pouring more money into drilling with no oil to show for it. Pattillo Higgins left the company and teamed with Captain Anthony F. Lucas, the leading expert in the U.S. on salt dome formations. Lucas made a lease agreement in 1899 with the Gladys City Company and a subsequent agreement with Higgins. Lucas drilled to [ 575 ft m -1 ] before running out of money. He secured additional funding from John H. Galey and James M. Guffey of Pittsburgh, but the deal left Lucas with only a small share of the lease and Higgins with nothing. { Daniel Yergin, The Prize, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991, p.75. } Lucas continued drilling and on January 10, 1901, at a depth of 1,139  ft (347 m), what is known as the Lucas Gusher or the Lucas Geyser blew oil over [ 150 ft m -1 ] in the air at a rate of [ 100000 oilbbl/d m3/d ] (4,200,000 gallons). It took nine days before the well was brought under control. Spindletop was the largest gusher the world had seen and catapulted Beaumont into an oil-fueled boomtown. Beaumont&apos;s population of 10,000 tripled in three months and eventually rose to 50,000. { Daniel Yergin, The Prize, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991, p.69. } Speculation led land prices to increase rapidly. By the end of 1902, more than 500  companies had been formed and 285  wells were in operation. Among those drilling at Spindletop was W. Scott Heywood, a native of Cleveland, Ohio, who in 1901 made the first oil discovery in nearby Jeff Davis Parish in southwestern Louisiana. In 1932, Heywood was elected to a single term in the Louisiana State Senate. [ http://www.lahistory.org/site25.php Heywood, Walter Scott Louisiana Historical Association, A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography January 30, 2011 ] Production at Spindletop began to decline rapidly after 1902, and the wells produced only [ 10000 oilbbl/d m3/d ] by 1904. On November 14, 1925, the Yount-Lee Oil Company brought in its McFaddin No. 2 at a depth of about [ 2500 ft m -2 ], sparking a second boom, which culminated in the field&apos;s peak production year of 1927, during which 21  millions barrels (3.3 GL) were produced. Over the ten years following the McFaddin discovery, more than 72  million barrels (11.4 GL) of oil were produced, mostly from the newer areas of the field. [ March 2009 ] Spindletop continued as a productive source of oil until about 1936. [ March 2009 ] It was then mined for sulfur from the 1950s to about 1975. [ March 2009 ] [ Spindletop-Gladys City Boomtown Museum ] [ Spindletop-Gladys City Boomtown Museum ] In 1976 Lamar University dedicated the Spindletop-Gladys City Boomtown Museum to preserve the history of the Spindletop oil gusher era in Beaumont. The museum features an oil derrick and many reconstructed Gladys City building interiors furnished with authentic artifacts from the Spindletop boomtown period. { http://www.spindletop.org/tour/index.html } [ References ] [ 30em ] McKinley, Fred B., and Greg Riley.
