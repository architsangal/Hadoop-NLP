The following year, a sawmill was constructed near Spring Brook in Spicerville that would provide the lumber used to start Eaton Rapids. In 1837, the Old Red Mill was constructed by the mill company and used the power from the stream to grind corn. The mill company later used wood from Spicerville to construct their own sawmill along the Grand River, as well as a wool carding mill. { A Brief History of Eaton Rapids } In 1852, mineral water was first discovered by E.B. Frost, earning Eaton Rapids world-wide fame and the nickname The Saratoga of the West. { A Brief History of Eaton Rapids } This water was in huge demand and led to a large influx of people seeking mineral water baths as well as cures from all types of ailment. Fourteen wells were drilled in total, only three of which still remain to this day. In 1921, John B. Davidson, Sr. came to Eaton Rapids from Philadelphia. He started the only mill in Michigan spinning its own yarn. The Davidson Mill supplied 95% of the wool yarn for the major league baseball, as well as high grade yarns for other appilications. After 48 years in business the mill burned in 1969. John B. Davidson served as mayor of Eaton Rapids as well as in both the State House and Senate. { A Brief History of Eaton Rapids } In 1927, Oldsmobile President Irving Jacob Reuter and his wife Janet built Meadowvue, an English Tudor mansion, at which they lived for nine years.

The property was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing, and became the home of its first Bishop, the Most Reverend Joseph H. Albers as his private residence. { Archdiocese of Lansing home page and history } The home was later sold to CJ and Mille Sumner who furnished the home with antiques and opened the home as an unusually ornate Adult Foster Care Home which they named &quot; Ivy Manor &quot;. The home was sold again in 1990 and made into a Bed and Breakfast.
