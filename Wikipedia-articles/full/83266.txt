It was formed in October 2004 by the merger of the Victoria University of Manchester (established 1851) and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (established 1824). It is a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive British universities, the N8 Group and a &quot; red brick &quot; university, its Victoria University predecessor having gained a royal charter in 1903. As of 2012, the University of Manchester has around 39,000 students and 10,400 staff, making it the largest single-site university in the United Kingdom. { The University of Manchester is the largest single-site university in the United Kingdom.

The University of Manchester had a total income of £808.6 million in 2010–11, of which £196.2 million was from research grants and contracts. The University of Manchester and its antecedent institutions have 25 Nobel Laureates among their past and present students and staff, the third-highest number of any single university in the United Kingdom (after Cambridge and Oxford ). Four Nobel laureates are currently among its staff – Sir Andre Geim (Physics, 2010), Sir Kostya Novoselov (Physics, 2010), Sir John Sulston (Physiology and Medicine, 2002) and Joseph Stiglitz (Economics, 2001).

[ 3 ] [ History ] [ Origins ] [ UMIST Victoria University of Manchester ] The Old Quadrangle at the University of Manchester&apos;s main campus on Oxford Road. The University of Manchester can trace its roots back to the formation of the Mechanics&apos; Institute (later to become UMIST ) in 1824, and its history is closely linked to Manchester&apos;s emergence as the world&apos;s first industrial city. [ http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/facts/history/ History and Origins The University of Manchester 2011-08-17 ] The English chemist John Dalton, together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the Mechanics&apos; Institute to ensure that workers could learn the basic principles of science. Similarly, John Owens, a Manchester textile merchant, left a bequest of £96,942 in 1846 (~£5.6 million in 2005 prices) [ National Archives Currency Converter ~ 1850 http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid 29 April 2012 ] for the purpose of founding a college for the education of males on non-sectarian lines. His trustee s established Owens College at Manchester in 1851. It was initially housed in a building, complete with Adam staircase, on the corner of Quay Street and Byrom Street which had been the home of the philanthropist Richard Cobden, and subsequently was to house Manchester County Court. In 1873 it moved to new buildings at Oxford Road, Chorlton-on-Medlock and from 1880 it was a constituent college of the federal Victoria University. The university was established and granted a Royal Charter in 1880 to become England&apos;s first civic university; it was renamed the Victoria University of Manchester in 1903 and absorbed Owens College the following year. [ Charlton, H. B. Portrait of a university, 1851-1951 1951 Manchester University Press Manchester, England x, 185 ] By 1905, the two institutions were large and active forces in the area, with the Municipal College of Technology, the forerunner of the later UMIST, forming the Faculty of Technology of the Victoria University of Manchester while continuing as a technical college in parallel with the advanced courses of study in the Faculty. Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the two universities continued to work together. Before the merger, Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST between them counted 23 Nobel Prize winners amongst their former staff and students. Manchester has traditionally been particularly strong in the sciences, with the nuclear nature of the atom being discovered at Manchester by Rutherford, and the world&apos;s first stored-program computer coming into being at the university. Famous scientists associated with the university include the physicist s Osborne Reynolds, Niels Bohr, Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick, Arthur Schuster, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and Balfour Stewart. However, the university has also contributed in many other fields, such as by the work of the mathematician s Paul Erdős, Horace Lamb and Alan Turing; the author Anthony Burgess; philosopher s Samuel Alexander, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre; the Pritzker Prize and RIBA Stirling Prize winning architect Norman Foster and the composer Peter Maxwell Davies all attended, or worked in, Manchester. The Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology formally agreed to merge into a single institution in March 2003.

Stiglitz. [ Campus and facilities ] One Central Park The main site of the University contains the vast majority of its facilities and is often referred to simply as campus. Despite this, Manchester is not a campus university as the concept is commonly understood. It is centrally located and the buildings of the main site are integrated into the fabric of Manchester, with non-university buildings and major roads between them. Campus occupies an area shaped roughly like a boot: the foot of the boot is aligned roughly south-west to north-east and is joined to the broader southern part of the boot by an area of overlap between former UMIST and former VUM buildings; [ 512 &amp; height=528 Campus Map 2009-07-03 ] it comprises two parts: North campus, centred on Sackville Street South campus, centred on Oxford Road. These names are not officially recognised by the University, but are commonly used, including in parts of its website; another usage is Sackville Street Campus and Oxford Road Campus. They roughly correspond to the campuses of the old UMIST and Victoria University respectively, although there was already some overlap before the merger. Fallowfield Campus is the main residential campus of the University. It is located in Fallowfield, approximately 2 miles (3  km) south of the main site. There are a number of other university buildings located throughout the city and the wider region, such as One Central Park (in the northern suburb of Moston ) [ http://www.manchesternti.com/about/one-central.htm Locations--One Central Park Manchester New Technology Institute 5 July 2010 ] and Jodrell Bank Observatory (in the nearby county of Cheshire ). The former is a collaboration between Manchester University and other partners in the region which offers office space to accommodate new start-up firms as well as venues for conferences and workshops.

The first to be built (in 1873) was the John Owens Building (formerly the Main Building: the others were added over the next thirty years. In fact, the Rear Quadrangle is older than the Old Quadrangle. Today, the museum continues to occupy part of one side (including the tower) and the grand setting of the Whitworth Hall is used for the conferment of degrees. Part of the old Christie Library (1898) now houses Christie&apos;s Bistro, and the remainder of the buildings house administrative departments. [ Contact Theatre ] { Contact Theatre } [ Contact Theatre ] The Contact Theatre largely stages modern live performance and participatory work for younger audiences. The present fortress-style building on Devas Street was completed in 1999 but incorporates parts of its 1960s predecessor. { Hartwell, C. (2001) Manchester. London: Penguin (reissued: New Haven: Yale U. P.); p. 311-12 } It features a unique energy-efficient system, using its high towers to naturally ventilate the building without the use of air conditioning. The colourful and curvaceous interior houses three performance spaces, a lounge bar and Hot Air, a reactive public artwork in the foyer. [ Jodrell Bank Observatory ] [ Jodrell Bank Observatory ] The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics is a combination of the astronomical academic staff, situated in Manchester, and the Jodrell Bank Observatory in rural land near Goostrey, about ten miles (16  km) west of Macclesfield away from the lights of Greater Manchester. The observatory boasts the third largest fully movable radio telescope in the world, the Lovell Telescope, constructed in the 1950s. It has played an important role in the research of quasar s, pulsar s and gravitational lens es, and has played a role in confirming Einstein&apos;s theory of General Relativity. [ Chancellors Hotel and Conference Centre ] [ Manchester Conference Centre Chancellors Hotel &amp; Conference Centre ] Chancellors Hotel &amp; Conference Centre Formerly named The Firs, the original house was built in 1850 for Sir Joseph Whitworth by Edward Walters, who was also responsible for Manchester’s Free Trade Hall and Strangeways Prison. Whitworth used The Firs mainly as a social, political and business base, entertaining radicals of the age such as John Bright, Richard Cobden, William Forster and T.H. Huxley at the time of the Reform Bill of 1867. Whitworth, credited with raising the art of machine-tool building to a previously unknown level, supported the new Mechanics Institute in Manchester – the birthplace of UMIST - and helped to found the Manchester School of Design. Whilst living in the house, Whitworth used land to the rear (now the site of the University&apos;s botanical glasshouses) for testing his &quot; Whitworth rifle &quot;. In 1882, The Firs was leased to C.P. Scott, Editor of the Manchester Guardian. After Scott&apos;s death the house became the property of Owens College, and was the Vice-Chancellor&apos;s residence until 1991. The old house now forms the western wing of Chancellors Hotel &amp; Conference Centre at the University. The newer eastern wing houses the circular Flowers Theatre, six individual conference rooms and the majority of the 75 hotel bedrooms. [ Organisation and administration ] { Victoria University of Manchester } [ Faculties and schools ] Despite its size, the University of Manchester is divided into only four faculties, each sub-divided into schools: Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences consisting of the Schools of Medicine; Dentistry; Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work; Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences; and Psychological Sciences. Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences consisting of the Schools of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science; Chemistry; Computer Science; Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Science; Physics and Astronomy; Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering; Materials; Mathematics; and Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering. Faculty of Humanities includes the School of Arts, Histories and Cultures (incorporating Archaeology; Art History &amp; Visual Studies; Classics and Ancient History; Drama; English and American Studies; History; Museology; Music; and Religions and Theology).

The college commissioned Alfred Waterhouse, the architect of London’s Natural History Museum, to design a museum building to house these collections for the benefit of students and the public on a new site in Oxford Road. The Manchester Museum was finally opened to the public in 1888. { The History of The Manchester Museum, University of Manchester.

The year after, the university finished in second place after losing out to the University of Warwick in the final. In 2009, the team battled hard in the final against Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At the gong, the score was 275 - 190 to Corpus Christi College after an extraordinary performance from Gail Trimble. However, the title was eventually given to the University of Manchester after it was discovered that Corpus Christi team member Sam Kay had graduated eight months before the final was broadcast, so that the team was disqualified. Manchester reached the semi-finals in the 2010 competition before being beaten by Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The university did not enter the 2011 series for a unknown reason.

[ http://www.accommodation.manchester.ac.uk/ouraccommodation/areaguide/city/whitworthpark/ Whitworth Park Halls of Residence ] It is most notable for the unique triangular shape of the accommodation blocks which gave rise to the nickname of &quot; Toblerones &quot;, after the chocolate bar. The designer of these unique &apos;Toblerone&apos; shaped buildings took his inspiration from the hill which has been there since 1962, when as a result of a nearby archaeological dig (led by John Gater) the hill was created from the excavated soil. A consequence of this triangular design was a much reduced cost for the contracted construction company. Due to a deal struck between the University and Manchester City Council, which meant that the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area, Allan Pluen&apos;s team is believed to have saved thousands on the final cost of the halls. They were built in the mid 1970s. It is also said by alumni, that the then University of Victoria got a grant for building the halls, and the then government would pay for the roof if they paid for the rest, hence they made very large roofs and not many bricks. [ December 2010 ] Dilworth House, one of the Whitworth Park halls of residence The site of the halls was previously occupied by many small streets whose names have been preserved in the names given to the halls. Grove House is a much older building and has been used by the University for many different purposes over the last sixty years. Its first occupants in 1951 were the Appointments Board and the Manchester University Press. { Charlton, H. B.(1951) Portrait of a University. Manchester: U.

[ Fallowfield and Victoria Park Campuses ] The Fallowfield Campus, situated 2 miles (3.2  km) south of the main university campus (the Oxford Road Campus), is the largest of the university&apos;s residential campuses. The Owens Park group of halls with its landmark tower lies at the centre of it, while Oak House is another large hall of residence. Woolton Hall is also on the Fallowfield campus next to Oak House. Allen Hall is a traditional hall situated near Ashburne Hall (Sheavyn House being annexed to Ashburne). Richmond Park is also a relatively recent addition to the campus. Victoria Park Campus, comprises several halls of residence. Among these are St Anselm Hall with Canterbury Court and Pankhurst Court, Dalton-Ellis Hall, Hulme Hall (including Burkhardt House), St Gabriel&apos;s Hall and Opal Gardens Hall.
