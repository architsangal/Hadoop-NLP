French is the sole official language and is by far the most widely spoken, but several regional language s are also spoken to varying degrees. Owing to immigration, a number of non-indigenous tongues are now also spoken in parts of the country. The map to the right displays the historical areas in which regional languages have been spoken. Some of these languages have also been spoken in neighbouring countries. [ Status ] [ Language policy in France ] The official language of the French Republic is French (art. 2 of the French Constitution ) and the French government is, by law, compelled to communicate primarily in French. The government, furthermore, mandates that commercial advertising be available in French (though it can also use other languages); see Toubon Law. The French government, however, does not mandate the usage of French in non-commercial publications by private individuals or corporations or in any other media. A revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles in July 2008. { Article 75-1: (a new article): &quot; Les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France &quot; ( &quot; Regional languages belong to the patrimony of France &quot; ). See } { Loi constitutionnelle du 23 juillet 2008. } The 1999 Report written for the government by Bernard Cerquiglini identified 75 languages that would qualify for recognition under the government&apos;s proposed ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. 24 of those languages are indigenous to the European territory of the state while all the others are from overseas areas of the French Republic (in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and South America). Although ratification was blocked by the Constitutional Council as contradicting the Fifth Republic&apos;s constitutional provision enshrining French as the language of the Republic, the government continues to recognise regional and minority languages to a limited extent (i.e. without granting them official status) and the Délégation générale à la langue française has acquired the additional function of observing and studying the languages of France and has had et aux langues de France added to its title. The category of languages of France (in French: langues de France) is thus administratively recognised even if this does not go as far as providing any official status. The regional languages of France are sometimes called patois, but this term (roughly meaning &quot; dialect &quot; ) is often considered derogatory. Patois is used to refer to supposedly purely oral languages, [ May 2011 ] but this does not, for instance, take into account that Occitan was already being written at a time when French was not and its literature has continued to thrive, with a Nobel Prize for Frédéric Mistral in 1904. At the time of the French revolution in 1789 it is estimated that only half of the population of France spoke French, and by 1871 only a quarter spoke French. { Professor John Merriman, France Since 1871 - Lecture 4 - A Nation? Peasants, Language, and French Identity [September 17, 2007] - http://oyc.yale.edu/transcript/357/hist-276 } [ Language education ] The topic of the teaching of regional languages in public primary and secondary schools is controversial. Proponents of the measure state that it would be necessary for the preservation of those languages and to show respect to the local culture. Opponents contend that local languages are often non-standardised (thus making curricula difficult), of dubious practical usefulness (since most are spoken by a small number of people, without any sizable corpus of publications) and that the curriculum and funding of public schools are already too strained. The topic also leads to wider controversial questions of autonomy of the région s. Regarding other languages, English, Spanish, Italian and German are the most commonly studied foreign languages in French schools. In April 2001, the Minister of Education, Jack Lang, admitted formally that for more than two centuries, the political powers of the French government had repressed regional languages [ September 2010 ], and announced that bilingual education would, for the first time, be recognised, and bilingual teachers recruited in French public schools. [ Cross-border languages ] Some of the languages of France are also cross-border languages (for example, Basque, Catalan, Picard, Norman, Franco-Provençal, Dutch, Occitan, Franc-Comtois and others), some of which enjoy a recognised or official status in the respective neighbouring state or territory (including French itself in Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and in the &apos;&apos;Val-d&apos;Aoste&apos;&apos; ).

One of the questions was about the languages that their parents spoke with them before the age of 5. This is the first time serious statistics were computed about the proportion of mother tongues in France. The results were published in Enquête familiale, Insee, 1999. Here is a list of the nine most prominent mother tongues in France based on Enquête familiale. Rank Language Mother tongue Percentage of adult population 1 French 39,360,000 86% (note that this figure is an underestimate because people under 18 years of age were not surveyed; see note #2 below the table) 2 German dialects ( Alsatian, Lorraine Franconian, etc.) 970,000 (of whom Alsatian: 660,000; standard German: 210,000; Lorraine Franconian: 100,000) 2.12% (of whom Alsatian: 1.44%; standard German: 0.46%; Lorraine Franconian: 0.22%) 3 Arabic (especially Maghrebi Arabic ) 940,000 2.05% 4 Occitan language ( Languedocian, Gascon, Provençal, etc.) 610,000 (another 1,060,000 had some exposure) 1.33% (another 2.32% had some exposure, see notes) 5 Portuguese 580,000 1.27% 6 Oïl languages ( Picard, Gallo, Poitevin, Saintongeais, etc.) 570,000 (another 850,000 had some exposure) 1.25% (another 1.86% had some exposure, see notes) 7 Italian, Corsican and Ligurian (Niçard) 540,000 1.19% 8 Spanish 485,000 1.06% 9 Breton 280,000 (another 405,000 had some exposure) 0.61% (another 0.87% had some exposure, see notes) 10 About 400 other languages ( Polish, Berber languages, East Asian language s, Catalan, Franco-Provençal, Corsican, Basque, West Flemish, etc.) as well as those who gave no response 2,350,000 (of whom English: 115,000) 5.12% (of whom English: 0.25% of total adult population) Total 45,762,000 (46,680,000 including those with two mother tongues who were counted twice) 102% (2% of people have both French and another language as their mother tongue, thus, they are counted twice) If we add up people with mother tongue and people with some exposure to the language before the age of 5 (see note #3 below), then the five most important languages in metropolitan France are (note that the percentages add up to more than 100, because many people are now counted twice): French: 42,100,000 (92%) Occitan: 1,670,000 (3.65%) German and German dialects: 1,440,000 (3.15%) Oïl languages (excl. French): 1,420,000 (3.10%) Arabic: 1,170,000 (2.55%) [ Notes on the table ] The data in the table are about mother tongue s, and not about actual language practice. It states that 14% of the adult people living in France in 1999 were born and raised up to the age of 5 in families that spoke only (or predominantly) some other languages than French. It does not mean that 14% of adult people in France spoke some other languages than French in 1999. Only adults (i.e. 18 years and older) were surveyed. This means that French people born between 1981 and 1999 are not included in the survey. The mother tongue of the younger generations is more predominantly French than is the case with the older generations, because as the Enquête familiale survey explains, regional and immigrant language transmission decreases dramatically with each new generation, as French replaces the regional and immigrant languages. In the Enquête familiale survey, only 35% of parents whose mother tongue was a regional or immigrant language reported they spoke that language to their children. Thus, the 86% figure of people with French as their mother tongue is an underestimate because the younger generations whose predominant mother tongue is French are not counted. The concept of &quot; mother tongue &quot; may not give a complete idea of the phenomenon of minority languages in France. This is because there are many people who were born and raised in families in which parents spoke to them only (or predominantly) French, but in which some regional or immigration languages were also occasionally used. One example: while the data tell us that 610,000 adults in 1999 had one of the Occitan dialects as their mother tongue, the survey also found out that another 1,060,000 adults were born and raised in families in which one of the Occitan dialects was occasionally spoken. Some of these 1,060,000 people may speak Occitan as fluently as the 610,000 people who have it as a mother tongue, while some other (the majority, probably) have only a limited knowledge of Occitan. We cannot infer from this that 1,670,000 adults are speakers of Occitan, but it may be the case that the total number of people with some form of exposure to Occitan is higher than the 610,000 figure, though some of this number may have abandoned the language since then.
