[ Bar Kokhba (disambiguation) ] Simon bar Kokhba ( [ שמעון בר כוכבא ] ) (died A.D. 135) was the Jewish leader of what is known as the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire in 132 CE, establishing an independent Jewish state of Israel which he ruled for three years as Nasi ( &quot; Ruler &quot; ). His state was conquered by the Romans in 135 following a two-year war. Documents discovered in the modern era { Signatures on documents found in 1951 and later in caves near the Dead Sea indicate that Bar Kochba&apos;s true surname was Bar Kosba, the &quot; son of Kosba &quot; or the &quot; man from Kosba. &quot; Read more: http://www.answers.com/topic/simon-bar-kokhba#ixzz1h1VU5ZPz } give us his original name, Simon ben Kosiba, ( [ שמעון בן כוסבא ] ) he was given the surname Bar Kokhba, ( Aramaic for &quot; Son of a Star &quot;, referring to the Star Prophecy of [ Numbers 24:17 HE ], &quot; there shall step forth a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite through the corners of Moab &quot; ) by his contemporary, the Jewish sage Rabbi Akiva. After the failure of the revolt, the rabbinical writers referred to bar Kokhba as &quot; Simon bar Kozeba &quot; ( [ בר כוזיבא ], &quot; Son of lies &quot; or &quot; Son of deception &quot; ).

The last straw was a series of laws enacted by the Roman Emperor Hadrian, including an attempt to prevent Jews from living in Jerusalem; a new Roman city, Aelia Capitolina, was to be built in its place. The second Jewish rebellion took place 60 years after the first and re-established an independent state lasting three years. For many Jews of the time, this turn of events was heralded as the long hoped for Messianic Age. The excitement was short-lived, however; after a brief span of glory, the revolt was eventually crushed by the Roman legions. The state minted its own coins, known today as Bar Kochba Revolt coinage. These were inscribed &quot; the first (or second) year of the redemption of Israel &quot;. Bar Kokhba ruled with the title of &quot; Nasi &quot;. The Romans fared very poorly during the initial revolt facing a completely unified Jewish force (unlike during the First Jewish-Roman War, where Flavius Josephus records three separate Jewish armies fighting each other for control of the Temple Mount during the three weeks time after the Romans had breached Jerusalem&apos;s walls and were fighting their way to the center). A complete Roman legion with auxiliaries was annihilated. The new state knew only one year of peace. The Romans committed no fewer than twelve legions, amounting to one third to one half of the entire Roman army, to reconquer this now independent state. Being outnumbered and taking heavy casualties, the Romans refused to engage in an open battle and instead adopted a scorched earth policy which reduced and demoralized the Judean populace, slowly grinding away at the will of the Judeans to sustain the war. Bar Kokhba took up refuge in the fortress of Betar. The Romans eventually captured it and killed all the defenders. According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews were killed, 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed. Yet so costly was the Roman victory that the Emperor Hadrian, when reporting to the Roman Senate, did not see fit to begin with the customary greeting &quot; If you and your children are well, all is well. For I and the army are all in good health. &quot; { The Archaeology of the New Testament, E.M. Blaiklock, Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids MI, page 186 } He was the only Roman general known to have refused to celebrate his victory with a triumphal entrance into his capital. In the aftermath of the war, Hadrian consolidated the older political units of Judaea, Galilee and Samaria into the new province of Syria Palaestina, which is commonly interpreted as an attempt to complete the disassociation with Judaea [ http://cojs.org/cojswiki/When_Palestine_Meant_Israel%2C_David_Jacobson%2C_BAR_27%3A03%2C_May/Jun_2001 When Palestine Meant Israel, David Jacobson, BAR 27:03, May/Jun 2001 Cojs.org 2011-08-07 ] [ http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm#135-337 Palestine: History: 135–337: Syria Palaestina and the Tetrarchy 2008-07-06 Lehmann Clayton Miles 1998 Summer The On-line Encyclopedia of the Roman Provinces University of South Dakota ] { Sharon, 1998, p. 4. According to Moshe Sharon: &quot; Eager to obliterate the name of the rebellious } { Judaea &quot;, the Roman authorities renamed it Palaestina or Syria Palaestina. } Over the past few decades, new information about the revolt has come to light, from the discovery of several collections of letters, some possibly by Bar Kokhba himself, in the Cave of Letters overlooking the Dead Sea.
