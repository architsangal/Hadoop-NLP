The oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate can be summarized as follows: CH 3 CHO + NAD + + CoA → acetyl-CoA + NADH + H + In humans, there are three known genes which encode this enzymatic activity, ALDH1A1, ALDH2, and the more recently discovered ALDH1B1 (also known as ALDH5 ). These enzymes are members of the larger class of aldehyde dehydrogenase s. The CAS number for this type of the enzyme is [9028-91-5]. [ Structure ] Cys teine -302 is one of three consecutive Cys residues and is crucial to the enzyme’s catalytic function. The residue is alkylated by iodoacetamide in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes, with modifications to Cys-302 indicative of catalytic activity with other residues. Furthermore, the preceding sequence Gln-Gly-Gln-Cys is conserved in both isozymes for both human and horse, which is consistent with Cys-302 being crucial to catalytic function. [ Hempel J, Kaiser R, Jornvall H. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase from human liver Eur. J. Biochem. 153 1 13–28 1985 4065146 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1985.tb09260.x ] 200px As discovered by site-directed mutagenesis, glutamate -268 is a key component of liver acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and is also critical to catalytic activity. Since activity in mutants could not be restored by addition of general bases, it’s suggested that the residue functions as a general base for activation of the essential Cys-302 residue. [ Wang X, Weiner H. Involvement of glutamate 268 in the active site of human liver mitochondrial (class 2) aldehyde dehydrogenase as probed by site-directed mutagenesis Biochemistry 34 JAN 10 237–243 1995 7819202 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7819202 10.1021/bi00001a028 ] In bacteria, acylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase forms a bifunctional heterodimer with metal-dependent 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase. Utilized in the bacterial degradation of toxic aromatic compounds, the enzyme’s crystal structure indicates that intermediates are shuttled directly between active sites through a hydrophobic intermediary channel, providing an unreactive environment in which to move the reactive acetaldehyde intermediate from the aldolase active site to the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase active site. Such communication between proteins allows for the efficient transfer substrates from one active site to the next. [ Evolution ] Although the two isozymes (ALDH1 and ALDH2) do not share a common subunit, the homology between the human ALDH1 and ALDH2 proteins is 66% at the coding nucleotide level and 69% at the amino acid level, which is found to be lower than the 91% homology between human ALDH1 and horse ALDH1. Such a finding is consistent with evidence suggesting the early evoluationary divergence between cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes, as seen in the 50% homology between pig mitochondrial and cytosolic asparatate aminotransferases.

USA 82 JUNE 3771–3775 1985 http://www.pnas.org/content/82/11/3771.abstract 10.1073/pnas.82.11.3771 397869 2987944 ] [ Role in metabolism of alcohol ] In the liver, the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase oxidize s ethanol into acetaldehyde, which is then further converted into the harmless acetic acid (vinegar) by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde is more toxic than alcohol and is responsible for many hangover symptoms. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is known to assist in processing acetaldehyde in the body and therefore can help to relieve hangover symptoms. Some persons of far-Eastern descent have a dominant mutation in their acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, [ Xiao Q, Weiner H, Crabb DW The mutation in the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) gene responsible for alcohol-induced flushing increases turnover of the enzyme tetramers in a dominant fashion J. Clin. Invest. 98 9 2027–2032 1996 8903321 http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/9/2027 10.1172/JCI119007 507646 ] making this enzyme less effective. A similar mutation is found in about 5-10% of blond-haired blue-eyed people of Northern European descent. In these people, acetaldehyde accumulates after drinking alcohol, leading to symptoms of acetaldehyde poisoning, including the characteristic flushing of the skin and increased heart and respiration rates. Other symptoms can include severe abdominal and urinary tract cramping, hot and cold flashes, profuse sweating, and profound malaise. Individuals with deficient acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity are far less likely to become alcoholic s, but seem to be at a greater risk of liver damage, alcohol-induced asthma, and contracting cancers of the oro-pharynx and esophagus due to acetaldehyde overexposure. 400px ALDH2, which has a lower K M for acetaldhehydes than ALDH1 and acts predominantly in the mitochondrial matrix, is the main enzyme in acetaldehyde metabolism and has three genotypes. A single point mutation (G → A) at exon 12 of the ALDH2 gene causes a replacement of glutamine with lysine at residue 487, resulting in the ALDH2K enzyme. [ 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1998.tb03867.x Crabb D, Xiao Q.

Since ALDH2 is a randomized tetramer, the hetero-mutated genotype is reduced to only 6% activity compared to wild type, while homo-mutated genotypes have virtually zero enzyme activity. [ Lu Y, Morimoto K. Is habitual alcohol drinking associated with reduced electrophoretic DNA migration in peripheral blood leukocytes from ALDH2-deficient male Japanese?

[ Lind PA, Eriksson CJ, Wilhelmsen KC. The role of aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1A1) polymorphisms in harmful alcohol consumption in a Finnish population Human Genomics 3 1 24–35 2008 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19129088 19129088 ] The drug disulfiram (Antabuse) prevents the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid and is used in the treatment of alcoholism. ALDH1 is strongly inhibited by disulfiram, while ALDH2 is resistant to its effect. The cysteine residue at 302 in ALDH1 and 200 in ALDH2 is implicated as a disulfiram binding site on the enzyme and serves as a disfulfiram sensitive thiol site. [ Hempel J, Bahr-Lindstrom, Jornvall Hans. Aldehyde dehydrogenase from human liver European Journal of Biochemistry 141 1 21–35 1985 http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121380089/abstract 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08150.x 6723659 ] Covalent binding of disulfiram to the thiol blocks the binding of one of the cysteine residues with iodoacetamide, thereby inactivating the enzyme and significantly lowering catalytic activity. Activity can be recovered by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, although not with glutathione. [ Vallari RC, Pietruszko R. Human aldehyde dehydrogenase: mechanism of inhibition of disulfiram Science 216 4546 637–639 1982 http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/216/4546/637 10.1126/science.7071604 7071604 ] Metronidazole (Flagyl), which is used to treat certain parasitic infections as well as pseudomembranous colitis, causes similar effects to disulfiram. Coprine (which is an amino acid found in certain coprinoid mushrooms) metabolizes in vivo to 1-aminocyclopropanol which causes similar effects as well.
