[ historical graffiti Graffito (archaeology) ] [ yes ] { Toronto } Graffiti (singular: graffito; the plural is used as a mass noun ) is writing or drawings scribbled, scratched, or sprayed illicitly on a wall or other surface in a public place. [ http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/graffiti Graffiti Oxford Dictionaries 2011-12-05 ] Stickers and other adhesives are not considered graffiti, apparently because they are less common. Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and has existed since ancient times, with examples dating back to Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. [ Graffito Oxford English Dictionary 2 Oxford University Press 2006 ] In modern times, paint, particularly spray paint, and marker pen s have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner&apos;s consent is considered defacement and vandalism, which is a punishable crime.Graffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within hip hop culture, graffiti has evolved alongside hip hop music, b-boying, and other elements. { &quot; Mistery Interview. &quot; Powderbomb. 1 Mar. 2009 } Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities. Controversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials/law enforcement and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations. There are many different types and styles of graffiti and it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested, reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction. [ 3 ] [ Etymology ] { Church of the Holy Sepulcher, } { Jerusalem } Graffiti and graffito are from the Italian word graffiato ( &quot; scratched &quot; ). &quot; Graffiti &quot; is applied in art history to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is &quot; sgraffito &quot;, { Grant, Alison. North Devon Pottery: The Seventeenth Century. University of Exeter Press, 1983, pp. 1–2. } which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti was carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes chalk or coal were used. The word originates from Greek [ el γράφειν ] — graphein — meaning &quot; to write. &quot; [ History ] The term graffiti referred to the inscription s, figure drawings, etc., found on the walls of ancient sepulchers or ruins, as in the Catacombs of Rome or at Pompeii. Usage of the word has evolved to include any graphics applied to surfaces in a manner that constitutes vandalism. The earliest forms of graffiti date back to 30,000 BC in the form of prehistoric cave paintings and pictographs using tools such as Animal bones and pigments. [ Stowers George C. Graffiti Art: An Essay Concerning The Recognition of Some Forms of Graffiti As Art. HipHop-Network 1 March 2009 http://www.hiphop-network.com/articles/graffitiarticles/graffitiart.asp ] These illustrations were often placed in ceremonial and sacred locations inside of the caves. The images drawn on the walls showed scenes of animal wildlife and hunting expeditions in most circumstances. This form of graffiti is subject to disagreement [ Disagreement between whom and concerning what? October 2010 ] considering it is likely that members of prehistoric society endorsed the creation of these illustrations. The only known source of the Safaitic language, a form of proto-Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern Syria, eastern Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia. Safaitic dates from the 1st century BC to the 4th century AD. [ Modern-style graffiti ] The first known example of &quot; modern style &quot; graffiti survives in the ancient Greek city of Ephesus (in modern-day Turkey ). Local guides say it is an advertisement for prostitution. Located near a mosaic and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint and a number. This is believed to indicate that a brothel was nearby, with the handprint symbolizing payment. [ Urbane Guerrillas http://www.state-of-art.org/state-of-art/ISSUE%20FOUR/urbane4.html Mike Von Joel 2006-10-18 ] { Pompeii graffito caricature of a politician. } The ancient Romans carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in Egypt. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than it carries in today&apos;s society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought compared to today&apos;s popular messages of social and political ideals [ Ancelet Jeanine The history of graffiti UCL — London&apos;s Global University 2006 20 Apr. 2009 http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museumstudies/websites06/ancelet/thehistoryofgraffiti.htm ] The eruption of Vesuvius preserved graffiti in Pompeii, including Latin curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a phallus accompanied by the text, &apos;mansueta tene&apos;: &quot; Handle with care &quot;. Disappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity: &apos;&apos;Quisquis amat. veniat. Veneri volo frangere costas &apos;&apos;fustibus et lumbos debilitare deae. &apos;&apos;Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus &apos;&apos; quit ego non possim caput illae frangere fuste? - CIL IV, 1284. { Alexamenos graffito is believed to be the earliest known } { representation of Jesus. } Historic forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in this graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are CIL IV, 7838: Vettium Firmum / aed[ilem] quactiliar[ii] [sic] rog[ant]. Here, &quot; qu &quot; is pronounced &quot; co. &quot; The 83 pieces of graffiti found at CIL IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a peristyle which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect Crescens. The graffiti was left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at CIL VII, 12, 18–20 contains over 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The gladiator ial academy at CIL IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex: &quot; Celadus the Thracian makes the girls sigh. &quot; ) Another piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine: &apos;&apos;Landlord, may your lies malign &apos;&apos;Bring destruction on your head! &apos;&apos;You yourself drink unmixed wine, &apos;&apos;Water sell your guests instead.

It was not only the Greeks and Romans that produced graffiti: the Mayan site of Tikal in Guatemala also contains ancient examples. Viking graffiti survive in Rome and at Newgrange Mound in Ireland, and a Varangian scratched his name (Halvdan) in rune s on a banister in the Hagia Sophia at Constantinople. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Graffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls. { Tacherons on Romanesque churches } When Renaissance artists such as Pinturicchio, Raphael, Michelangelo, Ghirlandaio or Filippino Lippi descended into the ruins of Nero&apos;s Domus Aurea, they carved or painted their names { British Archaeology, June 1999 } { The Atlantic Monthly, April 97. } and returned with the grottesche style of decoration.There are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as Signature Rock, a national landmark along the Oregon Trail. Later, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic campaign of Egypt in the 1790s.

However, there are many other instances of notable graffiti this century. Graffiti has long appeared on railroad boxcar s and subways. The one with the longest history, dating back to the 1920s and continuing into the present day, is Texino. { Youtube.com, Some sort of video about Texino } During World War II and for decades after, the phrase &quot; Kilroy was here &quot; with accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and its filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of Charlie Parker (nicknamed &quot; Yardbird &quot; or &quot; Bird &quot; ), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words &quot; Bird Lives &quot;. { Ross Russell. Bird Lives!: The High Life And Hard Times Of Charlie (yardbird) Parker Da Capo Press. } The student protests and general strike of May 1968 saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchist, and situationist slogans such as L&apos;ennui est contre-révolutionnaire ( &quot; Boredom is counterrevolutionary &quot; ) expressed in painted graffiti, poster art, and stencil art. In the U.S. at the time other political phrases (such as &quot; Free Huey &quot; about Black Panther Huey Newton ) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the 1970s was the legend &quot; Dick Nixon Before He Dicks You &quot;, reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that U.S. president. { Kilroy on the } { World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.. } Rock and roll graffiti is a significant sub genre. A famous graffito of the 20th century was the inscription in the London subway reading &quot; Clapton is God &quot;. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an Islington Underground station in the autumn of 1967. The graffiti was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is urinating on the wall. Graffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment punk rock movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as Black Flag and Crass (and their followers) widely stencil ed their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band Missing Foundation was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan, and copied by hard core punk fans throughout the U.S. and West Germany.

[ Spread of graffiti culture ] A soldier in Italy (1943–1944) In 1979, graffiti artist Lee Quinones and Fab 5 Freddy were given a gallery opening in Rome by art dealer Claudio Bruni. For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with the art form. Fab 5 Freddy&apos;s friendship with Debbie Harry influenced Blondie &apos;s single &quot; Rapture &quot; ( Chrysalis, 1981), the video of which featured Jean-Michel Basquiat, and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with her a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop. { [ &quot; Hip Hop Meets Neue Deutsche Welle: Ja Ja Ja &quot; http://cheshm.org/2011/11/01/hip-hop-meets-neue-deutsche-welle-ja-ja-ja/] } Charlie Ahearn&apos;s independently released fiction film Wild Style (Wild Style, 1983), the early PBS documentary Style Wars (1983), hit songs such as &quot; The Message &quot; and &quot; Planet Rock &quot; and their accompanying music video s (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop. Style Wars depicted not only famous graffiti artists such as Skeme, Dondi, MinOne and Zephyr, but also reinforced graffiti&apos;s role within New York&apos;s emerging hip hop culture by incorporating famous early break dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s. { Labonte, Paul. All City: The book about taking space. Toronto. ECW Press. 2003 } Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983. { David Hershkovits, &quot; London Rocks, Paris Burns and the B-Boys Break a Leg &quot;, Sunday News Magazine, April 3, 1983. } Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers like PHASE 2 as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies like Beat Street ( Orion, 1984). This period also saw the emergence of the new stencil graffiti genre. Some of the first examples were created ca 1981 by graffiti artist Blek le Rat in Paris; by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney and Melbourne, where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis. { Ellis, Rennie, The All New Australian Graffiti (Sun Books, Melbourne, 1985) ISBN 0-7251-0484-8 } [ Graffiti as a memorial ] People often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffiti often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person&apos;s presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffiti is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae. [ Commercialization and entrance into mainstream pop culture ] [ Commercial graffiti ] { video game culture and graffiti culture found on the } { Berlin Wall } With the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant IBM launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a peace symbol, a heart, and a penguin ( Linux mascot), to represent &quot; Peace, Love, and Linux. &quot; However due to illegalities some of the &quot; street artists &quot; were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive and clean-up costs. [ CNN IBM&apos;s graffiti ads run afoul of city officials http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/04/19/ibm.guerilla.idg/index.html 2001-04-19 2006-10-11 James Niccolai ] [ Wired Sony Draws Ire With PSP Graffiti http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/12/69741 2005-12-05 2008-04-08 ] In 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by Sony and executed by TATS CRU in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Miami to market its handheld PSP gaming system. In this campaign, taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings &quot; a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle or a rocking horse. &quot; Along with the commercial growth has come the rise of video game s also depicting graffiti, usually in a positive aspect – for example, the Jet Set Radio series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a totalitarian police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists&apos; freedom of speech. In plotlines mirroring the negative reaction of non-commercial artists to the commercialization of the art form by companies like IBM (and, later, Sony itself) the Rakugaki Ōkoku series (2003–2005) for Sony&apos;s PlayStation 2 revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Following the original roots of modern graffiti as a political force came another game title, Marc Eckō&apos;s Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure (2006), featuring a story line involving fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the Jet Set Radio series. Other games which feature graffiti include Bomb the World (2004), an online graffiti simulation created by graffiti artist Klark Kent where users can virtually paint trains at 20 locations worldwide, and Super Mario Sunshine (2002), in which the hero, Mario must clean the city of graffiti left by the villain, Bowser Jr. in a plotline which evokes the successes of the Anti-Graffiti Task Force of New York&apos;s Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (a manifestation of &quot; broken window theory &quot; ) or those of the &quot; Graffiti Blasters &quot; of Chicago&apos;s Mayor Richard M. Daley. Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti (such as the &apos;&apos;Half-Life&apos;&apos; series, the &apos;&apos;Tony Hawk&apos;s&apos;&apos; series, The Urbz: Sims in the City, Rolling and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas ). Counter-Strike which is a Half-Life mod allows user to create their own and tag in game. Many other titles contain in-game depictions of graffiti (such as The Darkness, Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone, NetHack, Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked, The World Ends with You, The Warriors, Just Cause, Portal, various examples of Virtual Graffiti, etc.). There also exist a host of games where the term &quot; graffiti &quot; is used as a synonym for &quot; drawing &quot; (such as Yahoo! Graffiti, Graffiti, etc.). Marc Ecko, an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that &quot; Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career. &quot; [ SOHH.com Marc Ecko Hosts &quot; Getting Up &quot; Block Party For NYC Graffiti, But Mayor Is A Hater http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/7428 2005-08-17 2006-10-11 ] Keith Haring was another well-known graffiti artist who brought Pop Art and graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works—which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities like bags and t-shirts. Haring explained that &quot; The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It&apos;s about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn&apos;t want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement &quot;. Graffiti has become a common stepping stone for many members of both the art and design community in North America and abroad. Within the United States Graffiti Artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8 Osiris or Circa { Ganz, Nicolas. &quot; Graffiti World &quot;. New York. Abrams. 2004 } Meanwhile there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, The Mac that have made the switch to gallery artists often times not even using their initial medium, spray paint. But perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is by the French crew, 123Klan. 123Klan founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, have gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced, logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for the likes of Nike, Adidas, Lamborghini, Coca Cola, Stussy, Sony, Nasdaq and more.

Laws and taxes change frequently. &quot; Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the &quot; folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised, &quot; that is South American graffiti art. Prominent Brazilian graffiti artists include Os Gêmeos, Boleta, Nunca, Nina, Speto, Tikka and T.Freak. { Revistamarieclaire.globo.com } Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures { Nicekicks.com } has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of pichação and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of grafite. { Revelacaoonline.uniube.br } [ Middle East ] { Tehran, } { Iran } Graffiti in the Middle East is slowly emerging, with pockets of taggers operating in the various &apos;Emirates&apos; of the United Arab Emirates, in Israel, and in Iran. The major Iranian newspaper Hamshahri has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photo coverage of Iranian artist A1one &apos;s works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine PingMag has interviewed A1one and featured photos of his work. { Uleshka, &quot; A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran &quot;, PingMag, 19 January 2005. } The Israeli West Bank barrier has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the Berlin Wall.

New York. Abrams. 2004. } This includes such techniques as scribing. However, spray paint in aerosol cans is the number one necessity for graffiti. From this commodity come different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of visual graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and come in virtually every color. Stencil graffiti, originating in the early 1980s, is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as cardboard or subject folders ) to form an overall design or image. [ Stencil graffiti tutorial — Learn to design graffiti stencils onelegout.com Drupal Stencil Revolution 17 Apr. 2009 http://www.onelegout.com/stencil_tutorial.html ] The stencil is then placed on the canvas gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface. This method of graffiti is popular amongst artists because of its swift technique that requires very little time. Time is always a factor with graffiti due to the constant threat of getting caught by law enforcement. [ Modern experimentation ] Modern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, Graffiti Research Lab has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diode s as new media for graffiti writers. The Italian artist Kaso is pursuing regenerative graffiti through experimentation with abstract shapes and deliberate modification of previous graffiti artworks. Yarnbombing is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification. [ Characteristics of common graffiti ] [ Graffiti terminology Graffiti in the United States ] An example of a tag from Germany [ April 2011 ] Some of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A &quot; tag &quot; is the most basic writing of an artist&apos;s name, it is simply a handstyle. A graffiti writer&apos;s tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and might incorporate the artist&apos;s crew initials or other letters.One form of tagging known as &quot; pissing &quot; is the act of taking a refillable fire extinguisher and replacing the contents inside with paint, allowing for tags as high as around 20 feet. Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy. Another form is the &quot; throw-up &quot;, also known as a &quot; bombing &quot; which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A &quot; piece &quot; is a more elaborate representation of the artist&apos;s name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This of course is more time consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. A &quot; blockbuster &quot; or &quot; roller &quot; is a large piece, almost always done in a block shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colours, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint. { stencil graffiti, a very common style, in } { Toronto } A more complex style is &quot; wildstyle &quot;, a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffiti artists as the letters merge into one another in an often undecipherable manner. Some artists also use stickers as a quick way to catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right, and are often used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly done on blank postage stickers, as these can be easily acquired with no cost on the writers part. Many graffiti artists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for Saber MSK while working on the worlds largest graffiti piece on the LA river. Another graffiti artist can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw up. This was exemplified by the writer &quot; CAP &quot; in the documentary Style Wars, who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as &quot; capping &quot; and is often done when there is &quot; beef &quot;, conflict between writers. { Stencil s by } { John Fekner : Charlotte Street Stencils, } { South Bronx, New York, 1980. } [ Uses ] Theories on the use of graffiti by avant-garde artists have a history dating back at least to the Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism in 1961.Many contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of public art. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social emancipation or in the achievement of a political goal.

[ http://rpmurals.home.att.net/ Pictures of Murals of Los Angeles ] In times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically and/or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus of addressing cleavages in the long run. The Berlin Wall was also extensively covered by Graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive Soviet rule over the GDR. { Montclair, California. } Many artists involved with Graffiti also are concerned with the similar activity of Stencilling. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognised while exhibiting and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and urban Britain in the early 2000s, graffiti artist Mathangi Arulpragasam a.k.a. M.I.A. has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her music videos for singles &quot; Galang &quot; and &quot; Bucky Done Gun &quot;, and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in Brick Lane, stuck to lamp posts and street signs, having herself become a muse for other graffiti artists/painters worldwide in cities including Seville.

Many choose to protect their identities and reputation by remaining anonymous. With the commercialization of graffiti (and hip hop in general), in most cases, even with legally painted &quot; graffiti &quot; art, graffiti artists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the 1 of 4 hip hop elements that is not considered &quot; performance art &quot; despite the image of the &quot; singing and dancing star &quot; that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a form of visual art, it might also be said that many graffiti artists still fall in the category of the introverted archetypal artist. Banksy is one of the world&apos;s most notorious and popular street artist who continues to remain faceless in today&apos;s society. { Banksy. Wall and Piece.

In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy&apos;s artwork can be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, though he has painted pictures around the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel &apos;s controversial West Bank barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of exhibitions have also taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy&apos;s art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while other officials have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it. Pixnit is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public.

It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the anarcho-punk band Crass, who conducted a campaign of stenciling anti-war, anarchist, feminist and anti-consumerist messages around the London Underground system during the late 1970s and early 1980s. [ Southern Records Crass Discography (Christ&apos;s reality asylum) http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09400a.html unknown 2006-10-11 ] In Amsterdam graffiti was a major part of the punk scene.

So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there already was a vibrant graffiti culture. Graffiti on the train line leading to Central Station in Amsterdam. The student protests and general strike of May 1968 saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchist, and situationist slogans such as L&apos;ennui est contre-révolutionnaire ( &quot; Boredom is counterrevolutionary &quot; ) and Lisez moins, vivez plus ( &quot; Read less, live more &quot; ). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the millenarian and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers. [ right 220px &quot; I think graffiti writing is a way of defining what our generation is like. Excuse the French, we&apos;re not a bunch of p---- artists. Traditionally artists have been considered soft and mellow people, a little bit kooky. Maybe we&apos;re a little bit more like pirates that way. We defend our territory, whatever space we steal to paint on, we defend it fiercely. &quot; ] The developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as &quot; on the street &quot; or &quot; underground &quot;, contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the subvertising, culture jamming or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints for a variety of reasons—but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street—such protest are impermanent but effective nevertheless. In some areas where a number of artist share the impermanence ideal, there grows an informal competition. That is, the length of time that a work escapes destruction is related to the amount of respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would invariably be removed immediately. The most talented artist might have works last for days. Artists whose primary object is to assert control over property—and not primarily to create of an expressive work of art, political or otherwise—resist switching to impermanent paints. Contemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as Alexander Brener, have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences forced onto them as a means of further protest. [ Village Voice Border Crossings http://www.villagevoice.com/art/0030%2Clevin%2C16706%2C13.html 2000-08-01 2006-10-11 ] The practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each others&apos; practices. Anti-capitalist art group the Space Hijackers, for example, did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political imagery. On top of the political aspect of graffiti as a movement, political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their point of view. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. far-left or far-right groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money – or sometimes the desire – to buy advertising to get their message across, and that a &quot; ruling class &quot; or &quot; establishment &quot; control the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical/alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example fascist supporters often scrawl swastika s and other Nazi images. One innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of underground press writers such as the poet and playwright Heathcote Williams and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for counterculture propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a John Bull printing set. Although short lived the MLF was representative of London&apos;s Ladbroke Grove centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable anti-establishment and humorous street graffiti much of it also produced by Williams. { Historytalk.org } In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as &quot; Death to the dictator &quot;. In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as &quot; Banks=Robbers &quot;, relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis. { segregated communities in Northern Ireland. } Both sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti include large wall paintings, referred to as murals. Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the Peace Lines, high walls that separate different communities. The murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or iconographic content. Loyalist murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between James II and William III in the late 17th century, whereas Republican murals usually refer to the more recent troubles. Territorial graffiti serves as marking ground to display tags and logos that differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang related graffiti consists of cryptic symbols and initials strictly fashioned with unique calligraphies. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.

In NYC, Bronx-based TATS CRU has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies like Coca Cola, McDonald&apos;s, Toyota, and MTV. In the U.K. Covent Garden&apos;s Boxfresh used stencil images of a Zapatista revolutionary in the hopes of cross referencing would promote their store. Smirnoff hired artists to use reverse graffiti (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. Shepard Fairey rose to fame after his &quot; Andre the Giant Has a Posse &quot; sticker campaign, in which his art was plastered in cities across America. Many graffiti artists see legal advertising as no more than &apos;paid for and legalised graffiti&apos; and have risen against mainstream adverts. The graffiti research lab crew have gone on to target several prominent adverts in New York as a means of making a statement against this criteria. [ Offensive graffiti ] { Millwood, Washington } Peace Sign Graffiti can also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti can be difficult to locate, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils whichhave adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly). [ Halsey M. Young A. The Meanings of Graffiti and Municipal Administration Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology 35 2 165–86 2002 ] Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight not easily recognized as &quot; racist &quot;. It can then only be understood if one knows the relevant &quot; local code &quot; (social, historical, political, temporal and spatial), which is seen as heteroglot and thus an &apos;unique set of conditions&apos;.

Fixing Broken Windows New York: Martin Kessler Books 1996 ] A spatial code could for example be, that there is a certain youth group in an area which is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti only containing the name or abbreviation of this gang is already a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases the herald of more serious criminal activity. A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger. Hence, the lack of obvious racist graffiti does not necessarily mean that there actually is none. By making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints), [ Barker M.

[ United States ] [ Graffiti in the United States ] [ Tracker databases ] Graffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender’s moniker or tag in a simple, effective and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all of the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all of the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them to not only focuses on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.

One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time, there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and the actual removal of it. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided and the action taken.
