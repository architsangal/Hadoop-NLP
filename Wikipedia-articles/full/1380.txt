[ 83 0 ] { Florida Alligator.jpg } { American Alligator Alligator mississippiensis } { Gray, 1844 } { Subfamilies } { * } { Alligatorinae * } { Caimaninae } Alligatoridae is a family of crocodylia ns that includes alligator s and caiman s. [ True alligators ] The lineage including alligators proper ( Alligatorinae ) occur in the fluvial deposits of the age of the Upper Chalk in Europe, where they did not die out until the Pliocene age. The true alligators are today represented to two species, A. mississippiensis in the southeastern United States, which can grow to 4.24  m (14  ft) and weigh 1000  lbs (454.5  kg) { http://www.eparks.org/marine_and_coastal/marine_wildlife/alligator.asp } and the small A. sinensis in the Yangtze River, People&apos;s Republic of China, which grows to an average of 1.5  m (5  ft). Their name derives from the Spanish el lagarto, which means &quot; the lizard &quot;. &apos;&apos;Alligator prenasalis&apos;&apos; fossil [ Caimans ] In Central and South America, the alligator family is represented by five species of the genus Caiman, which differs from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and the ventral armour is composed of overlapping bony scute s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Some authorities further divide this genus into three, splitting off the smooth-fronted caimans into a genus Paleosuchus and the Black Caiman into Melanosuchus. Caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators. [ Guggisberg, C.A.W. Crocodiles: Their Natural History, Folklore, and Conservation 1972 195 0-7153-5272-5 ] C. crocodilus, the Spectacled Caiman, has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about 2.2 meters. The largest is the near-threatened Melanosuchus niger, the Jacare-assu, Large, or Black Caiman of the Amazon River basin. Black Caimans grow to 16.5 feet (5 m), { &lt; http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/cnhc/cbd-faq-q2.htm &gt; } with the largest recorded size 5.79  m (19  ft). The black caiman and American Alligator are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the crocodile family. Although the Caiman has not been studied in-depth, scientists have learned that their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring. [ Differences from crocodiles ] [ Crocodilia#Differences between alligators and crocodiles ] Alligator s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the crocodile; in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips; and an intolerance to salinity, alligators strongly preferring fresh water, while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt. In general, crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators. Another odd trait recently discovered is that both caimans and the American Alligator have been observed taking foliage and fruit into their diet in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat. { &lt; http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/10/alligators_eat_fruit.php &gt; } [ Taxonomy ] { Everglades National Park, } { Florida, } { United States. } &apos;&apos;Alligator olseni&apos;&apos; forelimb Alligator prenasalis (extinct) Alligator mcgrewi (extinct) Alligator olseni (extinct) Chinese Alligator, Alligator sinensis Alligator mefferdi (extinct) American Alligator, &apos;&apos;Alligator mississippiensis { Subfamily } { Caimaninae } Cuvier&apos;s Dwarf Caiman, Paleosuchus palpebrosus Smooth-fronted Caiman, Paleosuchus trigonatus { Genus } { Purussaurus (extinct) } { Genus } { Mourasuchus (extinct) } { Genus } { Orthogenysuchus (extinct) } { Genus } { Caiman } Rio Apaporis Caiman, C. c. apaporiensis Brown Caiman, C. c. fuscus { Caiman lutescans (extinct) } { Caiman sorontans (extinct) - Not reported in the literature, probably a &apos; } { nomen nudum &apos; } { Broad-snouted Caiman, Caiman latirostris } { Genus } { Melanosuchus } Melanosuchus fisheri (extinct) Black Caiman, Melanosuchus niger [ References ] [ External links ] [ A. ] ar:قاطوريات be-x-old:Алігатаравыя bg:Алигаторови br:Alligatoridae ca:Caiman de:Alligatoren es:Alligatoridae eo:Aligatoredoj fr:Alligatoridae gd:Ailigeutair ko:앨리게이터과 hr:Aligatori id:Alligatoridae it:Alligatoridae he:אליגטוריים ka:ალიგატორისებრნი la:Alligatoridae lt:Aligatoriniai hu:Aligátorfélék mk:Alligatoridae nl:Alligators ja:アリゲーター科 pl:Aligatorowate pt:Jacaré ru:Аллигаторовые simple:Alligatoridae sr:Алигатор fi:Alligaattorit sv:Alligatorer och kajmaner th:Alligatoridae tr:Alligatoridae uk:Алігаторові zh-yue:短吻鱷科 zh:短吻鳄科
