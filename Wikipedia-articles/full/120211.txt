[ History ] Since the mid-19th century Minnetonka has evolved from heavily wooded wilderness through extensive farming and thriving industrialization to its present primarily residential suburban character.The Dakota and Ojibway Indians were the first people to settle in the area. They believed the land around Lake Minnetonka (minne meaning water and tonka meaning big) was the legendary home of an extinct race. The first recorded exploration of the area by European settlers was in 1822, when a group from newly constructed Fort Snelling made its way up Minnehaha Creek (then known as Brown&apos;s Creek or Falls Creek) to the lake. In 1851 the Dakotah sold the area including Minnetonka to the United States with the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux. The first census, the Territorial Census of 1857, lists 41 households. Twenty-nine of the heads of households are listed as farmers. The occupations of the remaining twelve are associated with the operations of Minnetonka Mill and a nearby hotel. { A Brief History of Minnetonka, Minnetonka Historical Society } In 1852 a claim was staked on Minnehaha Creek near McGinty Road. The sawmill that was constructed in the thick woods of maple, oak, elm, red cedar and basswood was the first privately-operated mill in Minnesota west of the Mississippi River. Oak timbers from this mill were used to build the first suspension bridge across the Mississippi River at St. Anthony Falls in 1853. The settlement of Minnetonka Mills that grew up around the mill was the first permanent European-American settlement west of Minneapolis in Hennepin County. In 1855 a two-story sawmill was constructed with a furniture factory on the second floor. A building for varnish ing furniture was built on the south side of the creek, at the present Bridge Street. Production consisted mainly of chairs and bedstead s. The Minnetonka Republican at St. Anthony published a short article describing the area. The February 12, 1857 issue said: [ 1000000 board feet m3 ] { of lumber is in the pond, half of it nicely seasoned. Machinery is on the way for a flour mill. J. P. Miller is erecting a new hotel. } { Charles H. Burwell House } The Cargill Lake Office, occupying a former mansion, houses the company&apos;s top executives. In 1860, after only 8 years of operation, the sawmill closed. In 1869 a flour and grist mill were constructed and operated until the late 1880s. In 1874 Charles H. Burwell came to manage the Minnetonka Mill Company, and he built a Victorian home on the north bank of Minnehaha Creek (Minnetonka Boulevard at McGinty Road East) for his family. The Charles H. Burwell House is now on the National Register of Historic Places and is owned by the city. There were two other mills in Minnetonka. The St. Alban&apos;s Mill, which was less than [ 1 mi km 0 ] downstream from Minnetonka Mills on Minnehaha Creek, operated as a flour mill from 1874 to 1881. A grist mill built on Purgatory Creek was washed out in a flood shortly after construction. Minnetonka Mills, with its post office and port for Lake Minnetonka, was the principal business and trading center for a large area until the 1870s. Between 1883 and 1956 the area within the original [ 36 sqmi km2 on ] township grew smaller as Wayzata, Hopkins, Deephaven, Woodland and St. Louis Park incorporated or annexed portions of Minnetonka. Excellent transportation facilities to Hopkins and Minneapolis began to transform Minnetonka township&apos;s economy. Train service to Minneapolis had been available since the 1880s and in 1905 streetcar service began. The attraction to become a city wage earner was great and rapid transit made it possible. In 1956, as a maneuver to prevent neighboring villages from continuing to annex portions of Minnetonka township, residents in 1956 voted to establish a village out of the remaining [ 28 sqmi km2 ] and the area was incorporated as Minnetonka Village. However, Minnetonka Village lasted only thirteen years. The complexities and the heavy demands of administering a rapidly developing community required professional management and larger representation. In 1969 a city charter was approved to serve the 35,000 residents. Ridgedale Center is located in Minnetonka.
