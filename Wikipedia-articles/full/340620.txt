Until 1974 it was in Berkshire, but was transferred to Oxfordshire in that year, and from Wallingford Rural District to the district of South Oxfordshire. It became the largest town in the new South Oxfordshire district, although it is situated right at its edge. [ History and economy ] All Saints&apos; church Didcot dates back to the Iron Age [ August 2009 ] The settlement was situated on the ridge in the town, and the remainder of the surrounding area was marshland. The Romans attempted to drain the marshland by digging the ditch that runs north through what is now known as the Ladygrove area north of the town near Long Wittenham. Didcot first appears in historical records in the 13th century as Dudcotte, Berkshire. The name is believed to be derived from that of the local abbot. Didcot was then a sleepy rural Berkshire village with a population of 100 or so [ August 2009 ] and remained that way for hundreds of years, only occasionally cropping up in records. Parts of the original village still exist in the Lydalls Road area and part of All Saints&apos; Church dates back to the 11th century. [ December 2009 ] It was much smaller than several surrounding villages, which are now dwarfed by modern Didcot. There are a number of major scientific employers nearby including the UKAEA at Culham (and the Joint European Torus (JET) fusion research project), Harwell Laboratory, the Science and Technology Facilities Council (the research council responsible for Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ) and the Diamond Light Source synchrotron, which is the largest UK-funded scientific facility to be built for over 30 years [ August 2009 ] Didcot is also the base of operations for the Baptist Union of Great Britain and BMS World Mission. Didcot also has a nature reserve, Mowbray Fields, where wildlife including a species of common spotted and southern marsh orchids can be found. [ Railways ] { Didcot Power Station and Platform 3 of } { Didcot Parkway } The Great Western Railway, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, reached Didcot in 1839. In 1844 the Brunel-designed Didcot station was opened. The original station burnt down in the later part of 19th century. The more obvious location for the original line to Bristol would have been the town of Abingdon a little further north, but the landowner, Lord Wantage, is reputed to have prevented the railway coming close to the town. [ July 2009 ] This and the junction of the Great Western line to [ Oxford ] created the conditions for the future growth of Didcot. The station&apos;s name also finally fixed the spelling of Didcot. Didcot&apos;s junction of the routes to London, Bristol, Oxford and to Southampton via the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway (DN &amp; S) made the town of strategic importance to military logistics, in particular during the First World War campaign on the Western Front and the Second World War preparations for D-Day. The DN &amp; S line has since closed and the sites of the large Army and Royal Air Force ordnance depots that were built to serve these needs have disappeared beneath the power station and Milton Park Business Park. However the Army still has Vauxhall Barracks on the edge of town. Remains of the DN &amp; S line are still in evidence in the eastern part of town. This line was constructed from 1879-1882 after previous proposals had floundered and was engineered by John Fowler and built by contractors T.H. Falkiner and Sir Thomas Tancred, who together also constructed the Forth Bridge. [ Sands T.B. The Didcot, Newbury &amp; Southampton Railway The Oakwood Library of Railway History 1971 Oakwood Press OL28 6–7 ] It was an extremely expensive line to build due to the heavy engineering challenges of crossing the Berkshire and Hampshire downs, and this over capitalisation coupled with initial traffic barely meeting expectations caused the company financial problems, meaning it never reached Southampton of its own accord but had to join the main LSWR line at Shawford, south of Winchester. But from the outbreak of WW2 such was the growth of wartime traffic to the port of Southampton a decision was made to upgrade the line which included the complete doubling of the northern section between Didcot and Newbury, closing for 5 months in 1942/3 whilst this was carried out. Although passenger trains between Didcot and [ Newbury ] were withdrawn in 1962, the line continued to be used by freight trains for a further four years, mainly oil traffic to the north from the refinery at Fawley near Southampton. In 1966 however, this traffic also was withdrawn, and the line was then dismantled. A section of the abandoned embankment toward Upton has fine views across the town and countryside and is popular with walkers. After World War II technology changed, with steam locomotive s becoming obsolete and the motor car becoming common. The station was renamed [ Didcot Parkway ] in 1985 and the site of the old GWR provender stores which had been demolished in 1976 (the provender pond was kept to maintain the water table) became a large car park so that the station would attract travellers from the surrounding area. The locomotive depot became the Didcot Railway Centre in 1967. [ Power stations ] [ Didcot Power Station ] { Didcot Power Station } The Didcot Power Station s (between Didcot and Sutton Courtenay ) supply electricity to the National Grid. Country Life magazine voted these the third worst eyesore in Britain, but some locals refer to them as &quot; the Cathedral of the Vale &quot; [of White Horse], a title which really belongs to the parish church at Uffington. The power station cooling tower s are visible from up to 30 miles away [ January 2009 ] due to their location, but won an award for reducing visual impact (six towers in two well-separated groups half a mile apart rather than a monolithic 3x2 block), much in the style of what is sometimes known as Didcot&apos;s &apos;sister&apos; station - Fiddlers Ferry Power Station - at Widnes, Lancashire, constructed slightly earlier. The power station has also proved a popular man-made object for local photographers. In October 2010, Didcot Sewage Works became the first in the UK to produce biomethane gas supplied to the national grid, for use in up to 200 homes in Oxfordshire.

Until 1974 it was part of Wallingford Rural District. It is the largest town in the parliamentary constituency of Wantage, which has been represented since 2005 at Westminster by Ed Vaizey, Conservative. Didcot is a parish but has the status of a town. It is administered by Didcot Town Council, which comprises 21 councillors representing the four wards in the town: All Saints&apos; (5 councillors) Park (5 councillors) Ladygrove (6 councillors) Northbourne (5 councillors) Elected town councillors are unpaid and offer their time on a voluntary basis. [ http://www.didcot.gov.uk/council/about.asp Didcot Town Council 2008-02-04 ] The 2009/10 Mayor of Didcot is Margaret Turner.The Town Clerk is Dominic Stapleton. { Didcot Town Council - Monthly Meeting Jan 2009 minutes } One of the many youth projects in the town is the Didcot Youth Council. A group of young people who live in the town meet on a regular basis with the Deputy Town Clerk, Stuart Carter, to organise events for the young people in Didcot as well as to highlight issues that they believe the Didcot Town Council should discuss. [ Town twinning ] Didcot is twinned with the town of Meylan in France. The Didcot-Meylan Twinning Association exists to encourage the building of friendships and relationships between the citizens of Didcot and its surrounding villages with its twin, to encourage the co-operation of local businesses to the economic success of both towns and prosperity of citizens, and to exchange ideas on issues that impact on the lives of the citizens of both towns and those in the wider regional and national arenas. { Didcot-Meylan Twinning Association } [ Current developments ] Didcot is now home to around 24,500 people, with a new town centre, The Orchard Centre { The Orchard Centre: Oxfordshire&apos;s Big Apple } which opened in August 2005. It took a further 2 years or so before nearly all the leases in the centre had been rented out by companies. To this day, there are still some empty shops, due to the economic climate. However, on 5 November 2009 the Orchard Centre saw the opening of the first branch of Alworths in the former Woolworths premises. [ Sloan Liam 11 November 2009 Warm town welcome for the &apos;Son of Woolworths&apos; The Didcot Herald 18 Newsquest (Oxfordshire) Ltd Oxford 0962-8568 http://www.heraldseries.co.uk/archive/2009/11/05/Didcot%2BNews%2B%28om_didcotnews%29/4723914.Crowds_flock_as__son_of_Woolworths__opens/ 13 November 2009 ] The new shop was managed by the manager of Woolworths&apos; former Didcot branch and was staffed by former Didcot Woolworths employees. The shop has since closed. Didcot has been designated as one of the three major growth areas in Oxfordshire with the Ladygrove development set to double the number of dwellings in the town since construction began in the late 1980s to the north and east of the railway line on the former marshland. Originally, the Ladygrove development was planned to be complete by 2001, however, the final section to the east of Abingdon Road only had plans announced in 2006. In anticipation of the completion of the Ladygrove development, a prolonged and contentious planning enquiry decided that a 3,200 dwelling development will now be built to the west of the town, partly overlapping the boundary with the Vale of White Horse. { http://www.southoxon.gov.uk:8123/website/localplan/text/section10.asp#DID2 } The development will contain much needed sports facilities as Didcot is currently amongst the poorest provided towns in Oxfordshire for leisure facilities. In 2008 a new £8million arts and entertainment centre, Cornerstone, was opened adjacent to the Orchard Centre. It contains exhibition and studio spaces, a cafe and an auditorium. Designed by Ellis William Architects, the centre is clad with silvered aluminium panels and features a &apos;Window Wall&apos;, used to connect the building with passing shoppers. { Didcot receives new arts centre http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview &amp; upload_id=10416 } The auditorium seats up to 236 people. [ Health ] The district in England with the highest healthy life expectancy, according to an Office for National Statistics (ONS) study, is the 1990s-built Ladygrove Estate in Didcot. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6985692.stm Regional health gap &apos;is 30 years&apos; 2012-02-09 BBC News 2007-09-09 ] While the average UK healthy lifespan was thought to be 68.8 for women and 67 for men in 2001, people in Ladygrove district of Didcot could expect 86 healthy years. It is believed Ladygrove may have benefited from the local recreation grounds and sports centre. [ Education ] Didcot is served by six primary schools : All Saints&apos; C of E, Ladygrove Park, Manor, Northbourne C of E, Stephen Freeman and Willowcroft. Along with these 6 schools based in Didcot, a further 7 local village schools form the Didcot Primary Partnership: Blewbury Endowed C of E, Cholsey, Hagbourne, Harwell Community, Long Wittenham C of E and South Moreton County. The two state secondary school s in Didcot are St Birinus School and Didcot Girls&apos; School. These two single-sex schools join together at sixth form. Didcot Girls&apos; School has specialist Language College status, and St Birinus has Technology and Language College status, it is also working towards a third college status.The cook of All Saints primary school was voted cook of the year 2009. [ August 2010 ] [ Sport and leisure ] Didcot Town Football Club &apos;s home ground is the RWE nPower Loop Meadow Stadium on Ladygrove Estate. The club won the FA Vase in 2005. Didcot Cricket Club &apos;s current home ground is at Didcot Power Station in Sutton Courtenay. { Didcot Cricket Club } Didcot has three main leisure centres: Didcot Leisure Centre, { Didcot Leisure Centre } Didcot Wave Leisure Pool { Didcot Wave Leisure Pool } and Willowbrook Leisure Centre. { Willowbrook Leisure Centre } Didcot has its own chapter of the Hash House Harriers. { Didcot Hash House Harriers } The club started in 1986 (the first run was on 8 April of that year). Cornerstone, the new 278-seater multi-purpose arts centre, opened on 29 August 2008.
