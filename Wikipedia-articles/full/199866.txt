[ December 2007 ] The village of Biyara, main base of the Ansar al-Islam 2001–2003 Ansar al-Islam (AAI) (Supporters or Partisans of Islam) was a Sunni Islamist group of Iraqis, { http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/ansar.htm } promoting a radical interpretation of Islam, close to the official Saudi ideology of Wahhabism with strict application of Sharia. The group was formed in the northern provinces of Iraq near the Iranian border, and previously had established bases occupying Biyara to the northeast of Halabja. Ansar al-Islam is known as an affiliate of the Al-Qaeda terror network. { Schanzer, Jonathan. Al-Qaeda&apos;s armies: Middle East affiliate groups &amp; the next generation of terror. Specialist Press International. New York, 2005. } Members of Ansar al-Islam mostly reside in Iran after a joint mission by the Kurdistan Regional Government&apos;s Armed Forces and US Army Special Forces destroyed the group&apos;s stronghold in 2003. Since then, the group has allegedly launched frequent attacks against the Kurdistan Region in attempt to reestablish themselves in the region. Kurdish authorities allege that the group frequently aids Iran in its border incursions against Kurdish rebels along the Iran-Iraq border. { http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurds/3851.html/ } In 2007 after major defeats by the KRG&apos;s Peshmerga&apos;s forces, Ansar al-Islam largely disbanded and splinter groups were formed, including al-Qaeda Kurdish Battalions. However AAI is still believed to be active in northwest Iran. On December 15, 2011 Ansar al-Islam announced a new emir, Sheikh Abu Hashim Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman al Ibrahim { Long War Journal 01/05/2012 } [ History ] Ansar al-Islam was formed in September 2001 as a merger of Jund al-Islam (Soldiers of Islam), led by Abu Abdallah al-Shafi&apos;i, and a splinter group from the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan led by Mullah Krekar. Krekar became the leader of the merged Ansar al-Islam, which opposed an agreement made between IMK and the dominant Kurdish group in the area, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The group later made an allegiance to al-Qaeda and allegedly received direct funds from the terror network. { Terrorism &amp; It&apos;s Effects. Sanchez, Juan. Global Media, 2007. } Villagers under their control were subjected to harsh sharia laws; musical instruments were destroyed and singing forbidden. The only school for girls in the area was destroyed, and all pictures of women removed from merchandise labels. Sufi shrines were desecrated and members of the Kaka&apos;i (a religious group also known as Ahl-e Haqq ) were forced to convert to Islam or flee. Former prisoners of the group also claim that Ansar al-Islam routinely uses torture and severe beatings when interrogating prisoners. Beheading of prisoners has also been reported. { Ansar al-Islam in Iraqi Kurdistan (Human Rights Watch Backgrounder, ) } Ansar al-Islam initially comprised approximately 300 men, many of these veterans from the Soviet-Afghan War, and a proportion being neither Kurd nor Arab. During its stay in the Biyara region the group would have needed logistical support from Iran, prompting allegations of support from &quot; powerful factions in Iran. &quot; { http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=2104 &amp; l=1 } [ Operations after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq ] Ansar al-Islam cameraman US Special Activities Division (SAD) Paramilitary teams entered Iraq before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. SAD teams then combined with US Army Special Forces and the PUK Peshmerga to defeat Ansar al-Islam. This battle was for territory along the Iranian border that was controlled by Ansar al-Islam, and was executed prior to the invasion in February 2003. The US side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Army&apos;s 10th Special Forces Group. It resulted in the deaths of a substantial number of militants and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. { Plan of Attack, Bob Woodward, Simon and Shuster, 2004. } Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in Iraq. [ Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq Mike Tucker Charles Faddis 2008 The Lyons Press 978-1-59921-366-8 ] { http://wamu.org/audio/dr/08/10/r2081007-22101.asx An interview on public radio with the author } Ansar al-Islam detonated a suicide car bomb on March 22, 2003, killing Australia n journalist Paul Moran and several others. The group is also thought to have been responsible for a September 9, 2003 attempted bombing of a United States Department of Defense office in Arbil, which killed three people. On February 1, 2004 suicide bombings hit parallel EID-celebrations arranged by the two main Kurdish parties, PUK and Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq (KDP), in the Kurdish capital of Arbil, killing 109 and wounding more than 200 partygoers. Responsibility for this attack was claimed by the then unknown group Ansar al-Sunnah, and stated to be in support of &quot; our brothers in Ansar al-Islam. &quot; While many former activists in Ansar al-Islam have joined the Ansar al-Sunnah and similar groups, Kurdish authorities claim the organization is still active in Iraqi Kurdistan. In September 2006, 11 alleged members of Ansar al-Islam were hanged in Arbil. Ansar al-Islam has an extensive network in Europe organizing finance and support for armed attacks within Iraq. Several members of such groups have been arrested in European countries such as Germany and Sweden. [ December 2007 ] In December 2007 the Ansar al-Sunnah formally acknowledged being derived from the Ansar al-Islam, and reverted their name to the original. { http://counterterrorismblog.org/2007/12/ansar_alsunnah_acknowledges_re.php } In November 2008 an archbishop in Mosul received a threat signed by the &quot; ansar al-islam brigades &quot;, warning all Christians to leave Iraq or else be killed. { http://pukmedia.com/english/index.php?option=com_content &amp; task=view &amp; id=7622 &amp; Itemid=53 } On May 4, 2010 Abu Abdullah al-Shafi&apos;i, Ansar al-Islam&apos;s leader since Mullah Krekar left for Norway in 2003, was captured by US forces in Baghdad. { http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=125357 &amp; sectionid=351020201 } [ Alleged links to Saddam Hussein ] In the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration claimed that Ansar al-Islam had links with Saddam Hussein, attempting to establish a link between Hussein and al-Qaeda. The Senate Report on Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq concluded that Saddam &quot; was aware of Ansar al-Islam and al-Qa&apos;ida presence in northeastern Iraq, but the groups&apos; presence was considered a threat to the regime and the Iraqi government attempted intelligence collection operations against them. The DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] stated that information from senior Ansar al-Islam detainees revealed that the group viewed Saddam&apos;s regime as apostate, and denied any relationship with it. &quot; { Senate Intelligence Committee Report p.92-93. } The leader of Ansar al-Islam, Mullah Krekar, has also called Saddam Hussein his sworn enemy. { Mullah Krekar Interview, Insight News TV } Furthermore, in a &quot; Special Analysis &quot; report dated July 31, 2002, the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded the following regarding alleged connections between Saddam&apos;s regime and Ansar al-Islam: &quot; Should regime support to Ansar al-Islam be proven, this will not necessarily implicate the regime in supporting al-Qa&apos;ida. Ansar al-Islam is an independent organization that receives assistance from al-Qa&apos;ida, but is not a branch of the group. The Iraqi regime seeks to influence and manipulate political events in the Kurdish-controlled north and probably has some type of assets in contact with Ansar al-Islam, either through liaison or through penetration by an intelligence asset. &quot; { DIA, Special Analysis, July 31, 2002, cited in Postwar Findings about Iraq&apos;s WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments, pg. 71. } However, in February 2003, then United States Secretary of State Colin Powell told the United Nations Security Council, &quot; Baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization, Ansar al-Islam, that controls this corner of Iraq. In 2000 this agent offered Al Qaida safe haven in the region. After we swept Al Qaida from Afghanistan, some of its members accepted this safe haven. &quot; [ http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030205-1.html U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell Addresses the U.N. Security Council 2003-02-05 ] The general consensus of experts, as well as the conclusion of the intelligence community and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is that Saddam was infiltrating the group but that the two parties remained hostile to each other and did not establish a collaborative relationship. Colin Powell has since acknowledged that his speech presented no hard evidence of collaboration between Saddam and al-Qaeda; he told reporters at a State Department press conference that &quot; I have not seen smoking gun, concrete evidence about the connection, but I do believe the connections existed. &quot; { NBC, MSNBC, AP, &quot; No proof links Iraq, al-Qaida, Powell says, &quot; MSNBC News Services (8 January 2004). } However, after Powell left office, he acknowledged that he was skeptical of the evidence presented to him for the speech. He told Barbara Walters in an interview that he considered the speech a &quot; blot &quot; on his record and that he feels &quot; terrible &quot; about assertions that he made in the speech that turned out to be false. He said, &quot; There were some people in the intelligence community who knew at that time that some of these sources were not good, and shouldn&apos;t be relied upon, and they didn&apos;t speak up. That devastated me. &quot; When asked specifically about a Saddam/al-Qaeda connection, Powell responded, &quot; I have never seen a connection. … I can&apos;t think otherwise because I&apos;d never seen evidence to suggest there was one. &quot; { ABC News: Colin Powell on Iraq, Race, and Hurricane Relief } [ Swedish fund-raising case ] Ali Berzengi and Ferman Abdulla, the owner of a falafel stand in Stockholm, raised money for what they claimed was poor children and Muslims. The money was then transferred through Abdulla&apos;s food stand, using the hawala transfer system. [ Lönnaeus, Olle, Orrenius, Niklas, Magnusson, Erik Kiosken var en terrorbank http://sydsvenskan.se/sverige/article141850.ece Sydsvenskan 2006-02-12 2007-01-24 ] The Swedish Security Service was informed in 2002 that people in Sweden had transferred money to Ansar al-Islam. [ Swedish Security Service 2005 Swedish Security Service 2005 http://www.sakerhetspolisen.se/Publikationer/swedish_security_service_2005.pdf PDF 2007-01-22 ] [ October 2010 H3llBot ] On April 19, 2004, Berzengi and Abdulla were arrested along with another Iraqi, Shaho Shahab, and Lebanese -born Bilal Ramadan. Ramadan was released in September after a court found that there wasn&apos;t enough evidence to keep him in custody. Shahab was released in December after the government decided to deport him to Iraq. However, since Shahab risks receiving the death penalty in his home country, the deportation has not been carried out. [ Two Iraqis charged in Sweden with transferring money to al-Zarqawi http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-04-05-alzarqawi-money_x.htm USA Today / Associated Press 2005-05-04 2007-01-22 ] In Abdulla&apos;s apartment the police found a letter from a man who claimed to have been in contact with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, as well as a detailed manual on how to use coded language. On May 12, 2005, Abdulla and Berzengi were convicted by the Stockholm District Court for &quot; planning of terrorist offences &quot; ( [ förberedelse till terroristbrott ] ) and &quot; planning of public devastation &quot; ( [ förberedelse till allmänfarlig ödeläggelse ] ) according to Swedish law. Accord to the court they had transferred approximately one million SEK to Ansar al-Islam. According to the court there was strong evidence that the collected money had the specific purpose of financing terrorist attacks. Much of the evidence presented consisted of secret wire-tappings from U.S. and German intelligence sources. In the recordings Abdulla and Berzengi used coded language to describe the attacks. Berzengi, who according to the court was the leading of the two, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and Abdulla to six years. [ Stefan Lisinski Långa straff för terrorbrott http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d%3D147%26amp%3Ba%3D414181%26amp%3BpreviousRenderType%3D8 Dagens Nyheter 2005-05-12 2007-01-22 ] The Svea Court of Appeal later reduced the sentences to five years for Berzengi and four and a half year for Abdulla.

Abdulla is currently serving his sentence at the Norrköping Prison. The conviction of Berzengi and Abdulla was the first since the new Swedish terrorism legislation was taken into effect on July 1, 2003. It was also the first ever conviction in Western Europe of people financing terrorism.
