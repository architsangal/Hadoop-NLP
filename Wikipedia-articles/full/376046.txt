{ 2000 } { 93 minutes } { English } { US$ 10 million ( } { ¥ 1 billion) } G-Saviour (2000) is an live-action made for television film set in Gundam metaseries, set in the Universal Century timeline. It also officially marks the last events of the Universal Century. { official chronological order of animation and films. } [ Story ] The year is Universal Century 0223. The Earth Federation has collapsed, and autonomy has been restored to the various territories under the Federation&apos;s control. The Space Colonies have proudly shaken off their colonial past and now consider themselves independent &quot; Settlements &quot;. In this new power scheme two sides have emerged: the Congress of Settlement Nations (CONSENT), which is largely made up of former Federation members and encompasses Sides 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and their Earth-bound parent nations, and the Settlement Freedom League, Comprising Sides 1, 4, and the Lunar Cities. CONSENT suffers from a food shortage crisis, while the Settlement Freedom League has the agricultural capability to feed itself and thus is not affected by CONSENT&apos;s food shortage. When an agricultural breakthrough is made in the unaligned Side 8 colony Gaia CONSENT resolves to seize the technology by force to solve its own food crisis, or to destroy it, unless ex-CONSENT pilot Mark Curran and a ragtag band of MS pilots can stop them. [ Cast ] Mark Curran - Brennan Elliott (Japanese voice: Haruhiko Kato) Cynthia Graves - Enuka Okuma ( Ryoko Shinohara ) Mimi Devere - Catarina Conti ( Yumi Takada ) Lieutenant Colonel Jack Halle - David Lovgren ( Takaya Hashi ) General Garneaux - Kenneth Welsh (Russell Ishii) Dieter - Alfonso Quijada (Takayasu Komiya) Kobi - Taayla Markell ( Rei Sakuma ) Chief Councilor Graves - Blu Mankuma ( Kenji Utsumi ) Philippe San Simeone - Hrothgar Mathews (Toshihiko Kojima) Simmons - Brendan Beiser ( Kenichi Ono ) Dagget - Marlowe Dawn ( Emi Shinohara ) Lieutenant Tim Holloway - Peter Williams ( Naoki Bandō ) Barkeep - Christopher Shyer ( Kiyoyuki Yanada ) [ Production ] { Mobile suit pilot Mark Curran (Brennan Elliott) in &apos;&apos;G-Saviour&apos;&apos;. } The project&apos;s actors are predominantly from Canada, and the Japanese language version has Japanese dubbed into the movie. It was released in 2000 and intended, along with the Turn-A Gundam television series, to be the centerpiece of Sunrise&apos;s &quot; Big Bang Project, &quot; its 20th anniversary celebration for the popular Gundam metaseries. Its story time frame of Universal Century 0223 is the last known year of the Universal Century calendar. In the real life time frame, only a very few UC anime have been made since then, primarily concentrating on the One Year War, like MS Igloo series, and the latest Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn or crossovers with popular alternate-universe series like Mobile Suit Gundam Wing and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. Gundam&apos;s original story co-creator Yoshiyuki Tomino, who was not involved in this production, voiced his disapproval of G-Saviour at Anime Expo New York 2002, [ September 2009 ] and Bandai Entertainment has stopped producing its 2002 DVD release in North America. [ September 2009 ] The work is listed in the production catalog on the official Gundam website in Japan and the official website for Sunrise (the production studio for Gundam animated and live-action projects). It is still available on DVD in Japan from the original distributor, Bandai Visual. G-Saviour is unique among Gundam animated and live-action properties in that the word &quot; Gundam &quot; is not in the title, or actually used at all throughout the movie&apos;s run. It was the second attempt at producing a live-action Gundam feature (after the 1997 interactive video game Gundam 0079: The War for Earth { EX.org - Gundam 0079: The War for Earth } ). [ Game ] In 2000, a PS2 game was released to promote the film&apos;s upcoming release on Japanese television. The game takes place after the events of the movie and stars Reed Fox, a pilot of the Illuminati&apos;s Lightning Squad. Garneaux&apos;s confidant, General Bais, is developing &quot; Project Raven &quot;, which will greatly enhance the military strength of the CONSENT, it is Reed and Illuminati&apos;s job to see it doesn&apos;t succeed. The game is noteworthy for having more Mobile Suits than in the movie, which also move more fluidly. { - Review discussing many points of the film } [ Soundtrack ] [ G-Saviour Original Soundtrack Soundtrack Various January 24, 2001 Orchestral 1:14:44 JVC Victor Sotsu Agency ] [ Track listing ] &quot; G-Saviour Theme &quot; - Ikihiro - 02:37 &quot; Main Theme &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 03:50 &quot; Rescue &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 05:35 &quot; Invader &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 04:56 &quot; Bio-Luminescence &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 05:23 &quot; Flight &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 03:11 &quot; Escape &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 04:29 &quot; Illuminati &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 03:11 &quot; G-Saviour &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 01:10 &quot; Wounded Heart &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 06:17 &quot; Romance &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 01:27 &quot; Misfire &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 02:54 &quot; MS Battle &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 06:36 &quot; G-Saviour Advance &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 10:57 &quot; Declaration of Independence &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 02:33 &quot; To Earth &quot; - John Debney and Louis Febre - 01:57 &quot; New History - John Debney and Louis Febre - 03:06 &quot; Orb &quot; - Emily - 04:25 [ References ] [ External links ] [ Canada Film ] [ anime 283 ] [ 0198123 ] Official G-Saviour website (Archived) Gundam Perfect Web&apos;s &apos;&apos;G-Saviour&apos;&apos; DVD page Sunrise&apos;s &apos;&apos;G-Saviour&apos;&apos; DVD page Bandai Visual&apos;s &apos;&apos;G-Saviour&apos;&apos; DVD page [ Turn A Gundam Gundam metaseries (production order) 2000 Mobile Suit Gundam SEED ] [ Mobile Suit Victory Gundam Gundam Universal Century timeline U.C. 0223 none ] Category:Space adventure films Category:Super Dash Bunko Category:Universal Century Category:2000 films Category:Science fiction television films Category:2000s science fiction films Category:Canadian science fiction films Category:Canadian television films fr:G-Saviour it:G-Saviour nl:G-Saviour ja:G-SAVIOUR fi:G-Saviour zh:G-Saviour
