The population was 11,224 at the 2010 census, growing 12% since the 2000 Census. Much of this growth is likely due to the enrollment increase of the University of Wisconsin–Platteville. It is the principal city of the Platteville Micropolitan Statistical area which has an estimated population of 49,681. [ Geography ] Platteville is located at [ 42.73707 -90.477501 type:city_region:US dms inline ] (42.73707, -90.477501). [ 1 ] It is in the Hollow Region, as named by early southern miners, in the rolling hills of southwestern Wisconsin. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.2  square miles (10.9  km 2 ). None of the area is covered with water. Platteville is serviced by Wisconsin State Highways 80 and 81, as well as U.S. Highway 151. Originally, U.S. 151 went through the valley that made up the southern border of the city limits, but with the completion of the four-lane limited-access superhighway, traffic has been rerouted and now loops south of the city. The minerals in the area consist of galena, sulfide of lead (lead 86.6, sulfur 13.4). Sphalerite or zinc sulfide is also common in the region. Zinc and lead mining were in heavy production through the 1820s - 1920s. { Fatzinger, Dale Rodger. &quot; Historical Geography of Lead and Zinc Mining In Southwest Wisconsin 1820-1920: A Century of Change. &quot; PhD diss., Michigan State University, 1971. } Consequently, there are few straight streets in Platteville. As a result of the mining in the 1800s, a honeycomb of abandoned old mines, streets were located to avoid the mines.

[ History ] Platteville was a small farming and fur trading community along the Platte River, from which the town got its name. In the 1820s, lead ore or Galena was discovered in the area, a mining boom took the area by storm. The mining district encompassed a significant portion of southwest Wisconsin. More specifically, the counties of Grant, Iowa, Lafayette, and Jo Davies County (Illinois) played a major role in the mining of lead and zinc ore. The Galena, Illinois mining district, an area south of Platteville, had been known to many for years. { Nesbit, Robert. Wisconsin A History. 2nd ed. The University of Wisconsin Press: Madison, 1989. } Beginning in 1825, lead prices saw a dramatic boost and the Platteville economy flourished. { Nesbit, 96. } The &quot; grey gold &quot; (a common nickname for lead ore) was brought development of businesses and schools. Platteville&apos;s landscape was shaped by the mining that helped build the town, and mineral holes abounded everywhere. { Fatzinger, 16. } By the 1849s lead ore production was decreasing. However, the mining of zinc ore quickly filled the void for prospective work. Platteville was now an established town, complete with schools, an academy, newspaper, several churches, and a telegraph service as of November 1849. &quot; { Hibbard, James. Images of America PLATTEVILLE, Arcadia Publishing, 2004. } During this time, a teachers&apos; college and a mining college were founded. The Normal School was established on October 9, 1866. { Hibbard, 37. } The Wisconsin Mining Trade School opened in January 1908. { Hibbard, 83. } In 1959, these two colleges later merged to become Wisconsin State College and Institute of Technology. It was not until 1971 that the college became University of Wisconsin–Platteville, a school that specializes in engineering. Now a days, UW Platteville is also considered the best criminal justice college in the mid-west. Main Street, about 1910 Today, Platteville is mainly a college town, with some development in the white-collar sector. That growth is a result of the increasing number of engineering firms locating in Platteville to take advantage of UW-P&apos;s engineering program. From 1984 until 2001 the Chicago Bears football team held training camp on the campus of University of Wisconsin–Platteville. This resulted in a substantial infusion of money into the local economy each summer. That money stopped flowing after the Bears decided to hold training camp at Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois. In 2004, the University of Wisconsin System gave its approval to the University of Wisconsin–Platteville&apos;s plan to expand the student enrollment from 5,000 to 7,500. In 2004, U.S. Highway 151 was upgraded to a limited-access highway whose lanes run further south of Platteville, bypassing the city. Prior to the upgrade, the highway exits were closer to Platteville and Platteville has already made changes to adjust to the new southern US 151 bypass. A new hospital was built just north of US 151 and next to its off ramps. A Walmart Supercenter and a Menards have opened near the northern end of the US 151 bypass. [ Education ] The Platteville School District serves the Platteville area. Platteville High School is the area&apos;s public high school. Platteville High School &apos;s mascot is &quot; Henry Hillmen. &quot; [ Culture ] The main source of culture in Platteville is the Center for the Arts on University of Wisconsin –Platteville campus, which sponsors a steady stream of well-attended professional touring events. The &quot; Heartland Festival &quot;, a semi-professional theater festival that produces four shows that run throughout the summer, is a summer attraction featured at the UWP-Center for the Arts. The casts are a combination of professionals and local residents. [ Attractions ] Stone Cottage This home was built in 1837 by the Rev. Samuel Mitchell and still contains many of the original furnishings. The home was a home of the Major John Rountree, one of Platteville&apos;s founders. The walls of this home are two feet thick and made of dolomite Galena Limestone.

The M is a monogram for the former Wisconsin Mining School (now the University of Wisconsin–Platteville). The first M was first constructed in 1936 when two men, Raymond Medley and Alvin Knoerr climbed the Platte Mound and trudged through 2 feet of snow to form a huge letter M. Actual construction of the stone M began in the spring of 1937 and was completed in the fall of the same year. The M is composed of rocks laid on Platte Mound and is whitewashed (not painted) every year. The M is 241-feet tall, 214-feet wide and legs that are 25-feet wide. The M can be seen many places in Platteville and sometimes in Iowa, on a clear day. Atop the Platte Mound and the M viewers can see three states: Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois. The M is lit once a year during the University of Wisconsin - Platteville college homecoming. It is an attraction Platteville citizens generally appreciate. Rollo Jamison Museum and Mining Museum At the museums one can tour the Lorenzo Bevan&apos;s 1845 lead mine, ride a 1931 zinc mine train, and view many exhibits on Platteville&apos;s mining history as well as Rollo Jamison&apos;s personal collection of artifacts.
