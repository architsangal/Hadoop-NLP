[ the historical Southern California novel Ramona ] [ Ramona Book Series File:Ramona_Quimby_Collection_box_set.jpg Beverly Cleary Tracy Dockray Ramona Quimby Series Realistic Fiction HarperCollins ] The Ramona books are a series of eight humorous children&apos;s novels by Beverly Cleary that center on Ramona Quimby, her family and friends. The first book, Beezus and Ramona, appeared in 1955. The final book, Ramona&apos;s World, was published in 1999. The series begins when Ramona is four years old and follows her until she is in fourth grade. Two books in the series were named Newbery Honor books, Ramona and Her Father and Ramona Quimby, Age 8; Ramona and Her Mother received the National Book Award. Sometimes known as the Beezus and Ramona series, as of 2012 the books were being marketed by HarperCollins as &quot; The Complete Ramona Collection &quot;. [ Background ] The Ramona books grew out of Cleary&apos;s earlier Henry Huggins series and take place in the same neighborhood. In the Henry Huggins books Beezus was one of Henry&apos;s friends, and her younger sister Ramona was generally a pest to Henry, Beezus and the other children. &quot; It occurred to Cleary (while writing Henry Huggins) that all of the characters she had created thus far had no brothers or sisters. &apos;Someone should have a sibling,&apos; she wrote in My Own Two Feet, &apos;so I tossed in a little sister to explain Beezus&apos;s nickname. When it came time to name the sister, I overheard a neighbor call out to another whose name was Ramona. I wrote in &apos;Ramona,&apos; made several references to her, gave her one brief scene, and thought that was the end of her. Little did I dream, to use a trite expression from books of my childhood, that she would take over books of her own&apos; &quot;. [ Beverly Cleary Biograhical Essay EBMA http://www.edupaperback.org/Default.aspx?pageId%3D864519 4/28/2012 ] In 1955, after finishing three Henry books, Cleary wrote Beezus and Ramona, a novel in which Beezus was the central character. The plot revolved around fourth grade Beezus&apos; frustrations with her four-year-old sister. Then in 1968, having concluded the Henry Huggins series, Cleary returned to focus on the two sisters in Ramona the Pest. It became the foundation book of the Ramona series. As publisher, writer and reviewer Anita Silvey says, &quot; It was almost inevitable that Cleary would publish a series of books about this boisterous yet appealing character. &quot; Ramona the Pest, like the remaining books in the series, is written from Ramona&apos;s point of view. In Ramona the Pest Ramona enters kindergarten. The succeeding books follow her as she grows up and advances through school, usually at the rate of one grade over two books. Written from the 1950s through the 1990s, dates aren&apos;t mentioned in the books, and the children are designed to appeal to real children in any time period. The last Ramona book, Ramona&apos;s World, was published in 1999, 15 years after the previous one. [ Series ] Beezus and Ramona This is the only book in the series written from older sister Beezus&apos; point of view. In it, Beezus is struggling with her feelings for her annoying younger sister. Her four-year-old sister Ramona exasperates her with her high spirits and wild imagination. Ramona scribbles all over a library book, gets Ribsy locked in the bathroom, and disrupts Beezus&apos; art class. Finally Beezus realizes it is possible to love her sister, even when she doesn&apos;t always like her. Ramona the Pest Ramona and her neighbor Howie are going to kindergarten, and Miss Binney is their teacher. Ramona knows that she has been described as a pest, but she doesn&apos;t see herself that way, and in this book she tries very hard to be good and follow the rules. But sometimes she has difficulty time controlling herself, and one day she gets sent home from school for pulling her classmates hair. Convinced her teacher doesn&apos;t like her, Ramona refuses to return until a very special letter from her teacher brings her back. Ramona the Brave Ramona sees herself as fearless, and is sometimes surprised to realize that others don&apos;t agree. It&apos;s the summer after kindergarten, and things are changing at the Quimby house. Mrs. Quimby has a part time job, and the family is having an extra bedroom added on to the house. Ramona bravely confronts bullies at the play ground and a mean dog on her way to school, but she isn&apos;t prepared for how scary it feels going to sleep in the brand new bedroom - alone.

(Cleary) never sacrifices Ramona&apos;s integrity or intelligence &quot;. Part of the appeal of the series is watching Ramona grow up. Cleary&apos;s writing has been praised for its ability to show her main character maturing: &quot; Throughout the series, Cleary depicts Ramona&apos;s emotional development as well as her adventures and misadventures. &quot; Anita Silvey calls Ramona &quot; Cleary&apos;s most developed characterization, a child at once ordinary and extraordinary. &quot; { Silvey, Anita (editor), The Essential Guide to Children&apos;s Books and Their Creators, Houghton Mifflin, 2002, pg. 90; } [ Critical reception ] Generally critics have been positive about all the Ramona books, pointing out the pleasure readers derive from watching Ramona grow up in the series. &quot; Cleary outlines Ramona&apos;s joys and sorrows in a manner considered both poignant and hilarious &quot; [ Beverly Cleary Biographical Essay Educational Book and Media Assoc. http://www.edupaperback.org/Default.aspx?pageId%3D864519 4/28/2012 ] In Twentieth-Century Children&apos;s Writers, Cathryn Mercier praises Cleary&apos;s accomplishments through the series as a whole. &quot; Through Ramona, Cleary touches young readers on an emotional level which engages and challenges, but does not overwhelm. Her ability to sustain their attention over time, from book to book, remains an accomplishment beyond evaluation. &quot; Though now considered a standard for realistic children&apos;s fiction, Beverly Cleary&apos;s books were unique in their time. &quot; Ramona&apos;s complexity was something unusual in children&apos;s literature. Seen through the eyes of any other character, she could be a real nuisance. But when Cleary wrote from Ramona&apos;s point of view, all of the little girl&apos;s actions made perfect sense. &quot; { http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/sept08/cleary.html } They are still valued today, as Julia Doubt writes, and read around the world. { As of 2010, the Ramona series is available in a low of six, (Beezus and Ramona), and a high of eleven, (Ramona and her Father), languages. } [ Beverly Cleary Editions Worldcat http://www.worldcat.org/search?q%3Dbeverly%2Bcleary%2Bramona%2Bbooks%26amp%3Bqt%3Dresults_page 5/2/2012 ] &quot; It is greatly significant that today the Ramona series still sells in many languages and countries across the globe - reaching out to ordinary kids (and their annoying little sisters) - and their extraordinary common misunderstandings about the world - everywhere. &quot; { Eccleshare, Julia, (editor), 1001 Children&apos;s Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up, Universe Publishing, 2009, pg. 277. } As The Essential Guide to Children&apos;s Books and Their Creators says, Beverly Cleary &quot; remains one of those rare authors who are both critically acclaimed and immensely popular with young readers. &quot; [ Adaptations ] Cleary&apos;s Ramona books have been adapted for Canadian television as Ramona.
