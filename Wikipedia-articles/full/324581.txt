McCarthy has been increasingly mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. { Svenska Dagbladet, October 7, 2010, Här är favoriterna till litteraturpriset..

(english: Who do you think/do you want to get the Nobel Prize in Literature this year? } [ Writing career ] McCarthy&apos;s first novel, The Orchard Keeper, was published by Random House in 1965. He decided to send the manuscript to Random House because &quot; it was the only publisher [he] had heard of &quot;. At Random House, the manuscript found its way to Albert Erskine, who had been William Faulkner &apos;s editor until Faulkner&apos;s death in 1962.

In the summer of 1965, using a Traveling Fellowship award from The American Academy of Arts and Letters, McCarthy shipped out aboard the liner Sylvania, hoping to visit Ireland. While on the ship, he met Anne DeLisle, who was working on the ship as a singer. In 1966, they were married in England. Also in 1966, McCarthy received a Rockefeller Foundation Grant, which he used to travel around Southern Europe before landing in Ibiza, where he wrote his second novel, Outer Dark. Afterward he returned to America with his wife, and Outer Dark was published in 1968 to generally favorable reviews. [ Arnold Edwin Arnold T. Edwin Perspectives on Cormac McCarthy University Press of Mississippi 1999 1-57806-105-9 ] In 1969, McCarthy and his wife moved to Louisville, Tennessee, and purchased a barn, which McCarthy renovated, even doing the stonework himself. Here he wrote his next book, Child of God, based on actual events. Child of God was published in 1973. Like Outer Dark before it, Child of God was set in southern Appalachia. In 1976, McCarthy separated from Anne DeLisle and moved to El Paso, Texas. In 1979, his novel Suttree, which he had been writing on and off for twenty years, was finally published. Supporting himself with the money from his 1981 MacArthur Fellowship, he wrote his next novel, Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West, which was published in 1985. The book has grown appreciably in stature in literary circles. In a 2006 poll of authors and publishers conducted by The New York Times Magazine to list the greatest American novels of the previous quarter-century, Blood Meridian placed third, behind only Toni Morrison&apos;s Beloved and Don DeLillo&apos;s Underworld. McCarthy finally received widespread recognition in 1992 with the publication of All the Pretty Horses, which won the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was followed by The Crossing and Cities of the Plain, completing the Border Trilogy. In the midst of this trilogy came The Stonemason, McCarthy&apos;s second dramatic work. He had previously written a film for PBS in the 1970s, The Gardener&apos;s Son. McCarthy&apos;s next book, 2005&apos;s No Country for Old Men, stayed with the western setting and themes, yet moved to a more contemporary period. It was adapted into a film of the same name by the Coen Brothers, winning four Academy Awards and more than 75 film awards globally. McCarthy&apos;s book The Road (2006) won international acclaim and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. A film adaptation (2009) was directed by John Hillcoat, written by Joe Penhall, and starred Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee. Also in 2006, McCarthy published the play The Sunset Limited. The play was adapted for film by the playwright for a version directed and executive produced by Tommy Lee Jones; it began airing on HBO in February 2011. Jones also stars, opposite Samuel L. Jackson. [ Current projects ] The Guardian reported in 2009 that McCarthy was at work on three new novels.

Retrieved: 27 April 2012. } McCarthy attended the University of Tennessee from 1951–52 and 1957–59 but never graduated. While at UT he published two stories in The Phoenix and was awarded the Ingram-Merrill Award for creative writing in 1959 and 1960. After marrying fellow student Lee Holleman in 1961, he and she &quot; moved to a shack with no heat and running water in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains outside of Knoxville. There they had a son, Cullen, in 1962. While caring for the baby and tending to the chores of the house, Lee was asked by Cormac to also get a day job so he could focus on his novel writing. Dismayed with the situation, she moved to Wyoming, where she filed for divorce and landed her first job teaching. &quot; [ Obituary: Lee McCarthy http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bakersfield/obituary.aspx?n%3Dlee-mccarthy%26amp%3Bpid%3D125527543 The Bakersfield Californian March 29, 2009 ] McCarthy now lives in the Tesuque, New Mexico, area, north of Santa Fe, with his third wife, Jennifer Winkley, and their son, John. He guards his privacy. In one of his few interviews (with The New York Times ), McCarthy reveals that he is not a fan of authors who do not &quot; deal with issues of life and death, &quot; citing Henry James and Marcel Proust as examples. &quot; I don&apos;t understand them, &quot; he said. &quot; To me, that&apos;s not literature. A lot of writers who are considered good I consider strange. &quot; McCarthy remains active in the academic community of Santa Fe and spends much of his time at the Santa Fe Institute, which was founded by his friend, physicist Murray Gell-Mann. Talk show host Oprah Winfrey chose McCarthy&apos;s 2006 novel The Road as the April 2007 selection for her Book Club. [ Your Reader&apos;s Guide to The Road http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahsbookclub/road/road_book_synopsis ] As a result, McCarthy agreed to his first television interview, which aired on The Oprah Winfrey Show on June 5, 2007. The interview took place in the library of the Santa Fe Institute; McCarthy told Winfrey that he does not know any writers, and much prefers the company of scientists. During the interview he related several stories illustrating the degree of outright poverty he has endured at times during his career as a writer. He also spoke about the experience of fathering a child at an advanced age, and how his now-eight-year-old son was the inspiration for The Road. McCarthy noted to Oprah that he prefers &quot; simple declarative sentences &quot; and that he uses capital letters, periods, an occasional comma, a colon for setting off a list, but &quot; never a semicolon. &quot; He does not use quotation marks for dialogue and believes there is no reason to &quot; blot the page up with weird little marks &quot;. In October 2007, Time Magazine published a conversation between McCarthy and the Coen Brothers, on the eve of their adaptation of McCarthy&apos;s No Country for Old Men.

Regarding his own literary constraints when writing novels, McCarthy said he&apos;s &quot; not a fan of some of the Latin American writers, magical realism.

The Olivetti Lettera 32 has been in his care for 46 years, since 1963. He picked up the used machine for $50 from a pawn shop in Knoxville, Tennessee.
