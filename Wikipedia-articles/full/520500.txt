[ Koa ] Acacia koa is a species of flowering tree in the pea family, Fabaceae. It is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, where it is the second most common tree. { University of Hawai i at Mānoa } { 2008-04-16 } { 2009-01-31 } The highest populations are on Hawai i, Maui and O ahu. Its name in the Hawaiian language, koa, also means brave, bold, fearless, or warrior.

At about 6–9 months of age, however, thick sickle-shaped &quot; leaves &quot; that are not compound begin to grow. These are phyllodes, blades that develop as an expansion of the leaf petiole. The vertically flattened orientation of the phyllodes allows sunlight to pass to lower levels of the tree. True leaves are entirely replaced by [ 7 – 25 cm in on ] long, [ 0.5 – 2.5 cm in on ] wide phyllodes on an adult tree. [ Flowers ] Flower s of the koa tree are pale-yellow spherical raceme s with a diameter of [ 8 - 10 mm in on ].

[ Fruit ] Fruit production occurs when a koa tree is between 5 and 30 years old. The fruit are legume s, also called pods, with a length of [ 7.5 - 15 cm on ] and a width of [ 1.5 - 2.5 cm in on ]. Each pod contains an average of 12 seed s. The [ 6 - 12 mm on ] long, [ 4 - 7 mm in on ] wide seeds are flattened ellipsoid s and range from dark brown to black in color. The pods are mature and ready for propagation after turning from green to brown or black. Seeds are covered with a hard seed coat, and this allows them to remain dormant for up to 25 years. Scarification is needed before A. koa seeds will germinate. [ Habitat ] Koa is endemic to the islands of Hawai i, Moloka i, Maui, Lāna i, O ahu, and Kaua i, where it grows at elevations of [ 100 - 2300 m ft on ]. It requires [ 850 – 5000 mm in on ] of annual rainfall. Acid ic to neutral soil s ( pH of 4-7.4) that are either an Inceptisol derived from volcanic ash or a well-drained histosol are preferred.

Among other Pacific Islands of volcanic (non- continental ) origin, only Vanuatu has native Acacia species. A. heterophylla, from distant Réunion, is very similar and has been suggested to be the closest relative of koa, but this is far from certain.

A closely related species, koai a or koai e ( A. koaia ), is found in dry areas. It is most easily distinguished by having smaller seeds that are arranged end-to-end in the pod, rather than side-by-side. The phyllodes are also usually straighter, though this character is variable in both species. The wood is denser, harder, and more finely grained than koa wood. Koai a has been much more heavily impacted by cattle and is now rare, but can be seen on ranch land in North Kohala. [ Conservation ] The koa population has suffered from grazing and logging. Many wet forest areas, where the largest koa grow, have been logged out, and it now comes largely from dead or dying trees or farms on private lands. Although formerly used for outrigger canoe s, there are few koa remaining which are both large and straight enough to do so today. In areas where cattle are present, koa regeneration is almost completely suppressed. However, if the cattle are removed, koa are among the few native Hawaiian plants able to germinate in grassland, and can be instrumental in restoring native forest. It is often possible to begin reforestation in a pasture by disk harrowing the soil, as this scarifies seeds in the soil and encourages large numbers of koa to germinate. Experiments at the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge have shown that ōhi a lehua ( Metrosideros polymorpha ) survives best in pasture when planted under koa. This is because koa trees reduce radiative cooling, preventing frost damage to ōhi a lehua seedlings.
