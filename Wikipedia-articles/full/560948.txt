R. R. Tolkien &apos;s fictional Middle-earth during the First Age. &quot; Boldog he sent, but Boldog was slain: strange ye were not in Boldog&apos;s train. &quot; { J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien editor, } { History of Middle-earth, Vol.III, (1985), Lay of Leithian, p.285 } As told in the Lays of Beleriand, Boldog, a formidable Orc Captain, by direct command of Morgoth, leads a Host of Orcs on a great razzia to ravage the realm of Doriath and capture Lúthien, the daughter of its King Thingol and Queen Melian, the Maia. Boldog drives his Host south over the highlands of Dorthonion and through the enchanted forest of Taur-nu-Fuin following the Orcs&apos; Road of Haste into the Pass of Anach which cuts down the mountains of Ered Gorgoroth and across the shadowed valley of Nan Dungortheb. There where fell darkness meet the mists of the magic, protective List Melian, the Girdle of Melian, just east of the river Mindeb the Orc-host reached the border of Doriath. To meet the deadly threat posed by Boldog&apos;s invasion in force, Thingol musters his full might with his two great Captains, Beleg and Mablung. He leads the army of Sindarin Elves beyond the North March of Doriath. Thingol and Boldog meet in single combat in the midst of the battle. Thingol wielded his Dwarf -forged sword, Aranrúth, Boldog fought with an iron spear of some note that was later used by Mablung in the Hunt of the Wolf. { J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien editor, } { The History of Middle-earth, Vol. II, (1984), p.38, &quot; a spear - a mighty weapon captured in battle with the distant Orcs &quot; } Thingol slays Boldog, the Orc-host is utterly defeated and the remnants destroyed by being driven into Taur-nu-Fuin. The Battle of the North March is the culminating battle of a series of attacks in Morgoth&apos;s campaign against Doriath following his victories in the Dagor Bragollach, Battle of Sudden Flame, the fourth Great Battle of Beleriand that broke the Siege of Angband. Other battles and events around Doriath include Beleg&apos;s victory in Brethil over an Orc-legion and the defeat of the Orc-army in East Beleriand as well as Lúthien&apos;s triumph over Sauron at Tol Sirion and the taking of the Silmaril from Morgoth&apos;s Crown in Angband by Beren and Lúthien. In contrast with Morgoth&apos;s success in the Dagor Bragollach, his campaign against Doriath was a series of setbacks and defeats at the hands of Thingol and his forces which inspired resistance and restored hope to the free peoples of Beleriand.

Boldog&apos;s independent command of a Host of Orcs with its formidable objectives indicates that he is several cuts above most other Orc Captains and Champions and it is thought elsewhere in the sources that he is of some lesser order of the Maiar serving Morgoth. { Tolkien noted that the name appeared over a long period of time during the First Age.
