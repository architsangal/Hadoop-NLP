The present monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, has reigned since 6  February 1952. She and her immediate family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic, and representational duties. As a constitutional monarch, the Queen is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. The Queen is also Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch&apos;s royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament, and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent. The British monarchy traces its origins from the Kings of the Angles and the early Scottish Kings. By the year 1000, the kingdoms of England and Scotland had developed from the petty kingdoms of early medieval Britain. The last Anglo-Saxon monarch ( Harold II ) was defeated and killed in the Norman invasion of 1066 and the English monarchy passed to the Norman conquerors. In the thirteenth century, the principality of Wales was absorbed by England, and Magna Carta began the process of reducing the political powers of the monarch. From 1603, when the Scottish King James VI inherited the English throne as James I, both kingdoms were ruled by a single monarch. From 1649 to 1660 the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican Commonwealth of England that followed the War of the Three Kingdoms. The Act of Settlement 1701, which is still in force, excluded Roman Catholics, or those married to Catholics, from succession to the English throne. In 1707 the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain and in 1801 the Kingdom of Ireland joined to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The British monarch became nominal head of the vast British Empire, which covered a quarter of the world&apos;s surface at its greatest extent in 1921. In the 1920s, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the Union as the Irish Free State, and the Balfour Declaration recognised the evolution of the dominion s of the empire into separate, self-governing countries within a Commonwealth of Nations. After the Second World War, the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the empire to an end. George VI and his successor, Elizabeth II, adopted the title Head of the Commonwealth as a symbol of the free association of its independent member states. The Commonwealth includes both republics and monarchies. At present fifteen other Commonwealth countries share with the United Kingdom the same person as their monarch. The terms British monarchy and British monarch are frequently still employed in reference to the person and institution shared amongst all sixteen of the Commonwealth realm s, [ The Invisible Crown Monarchy Canada http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm Toporoski, Richard 20 April 2008 http://web.archive.org/web/20080209220704/http%3A//www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm 9 February 2008 ] [ O’Donohue v.

[ Constitutional role ] In the uncodified Constitution of the United Kingdom, the Monarch (otherwise referred to as the Sovereign or &quot; His/Her Majesty &quot;, abbreviated H.M.) is the Head of State. Oaths of allegiance are made to the Queen and her lawful successors. { e.g. } [ http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/applying/ceremony/ Citizenship ceremonies 10 October 2008 Home Office: UK Border Agency ] God Save the Queen (or God Save the King) is the British national anthem, [ http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/NationalAnthem.aspx Symbols of the Monarchy: National Anthem 18 June 2010 Official website of the British Monarchy ] and the monarch appears on postage stamps, coins, and banknotes. [ http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coinageandbanknotes.aspx Symbols of the Monarchy: Coinage and bank notes 18 June 2010 Official website of the British Monarchy ] The Monarch takes little direct part in Government. The decisions to exercise sovereign powers are delegated from the Monarch, either by statute or by convention, to Ministers or officers of the Crown, or other public bodies, exclusive of the Monarch personally. Thus the acts of state done in the name of the Crown, such as Crown Appointments, { Crown Appointments Act 1661 c.6 } even if personally performed by the Monarch, such as the Queen&apos;s Speech and the State Opening of Parliament, depend upon decisions made elsewhere: Legislative power is exercised by the Crown in Parliament, by and with the advice and consent of Parliament, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Executive power is exercised by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, which comprises Ministers, primarily the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, which is technically a committee of the Privy Council. They have the direction of the Armed Forces of the Crown, the Civil Service and other Crown Servants such as the Diplomatic and Secret Services (the Queen receives certain foreign intelligence reports before the Prime Minister does &quot; In London, the revelations from [ 1989 Soviet defector Vladimir ] Pasechnik were summarized into a quick note for the Joint Intelligence Committee.

Post&apos;&apos; ). ). Judicial power is vested in the Judiciary, who by constitution and statute s3. Constitutional Reform Act 2005 have judicial independence of the Government. The Church of England, of which the Monarch is the head, has its own legislative, judicial and executive structures. Powers independent of government are legally granted to other public bodies by statute or statutory instrument such as an Order in Council, Royal Commission or otherwise. Apart from members of parliament and local authorities, no public officers are elected. The Sovereign&apos;s role as a constitutional monarch is largely limited to non-partisan functions, such as granting honours. This role has been recognised since the 19th century; the constitutional writer Walter Bagehot identified the monarchy in 1867 as the &quot; dignified part &quot; rather than the &quot; efficient part &quot; of government. { Bagehot, p. 9. } It has also been claimed that &quot; the UK needs a head of state for the very occasional crisis. &quot; [ http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-94.html The 1909 budget and the destruction of the unwritten British Constitution McLean Ian History &amp; Policy History &amp; Policy English 9 December 2010 United Kingdom ] { Bill of Rights of 1689 curtailed the monarch&apos;s governmental power. } [ Appointment of the Prime Minister ] Whenever necessary, the Monarch is responsible for appointing a new Prime Minister (who by convention appoints and may dismiss every other Minister of the Crown, and thereby constitutes and controls the government). In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the Sovereign must appoint an individual who commands the support of the House of Commons, usually the leader of the party or coalition that has a majority in that House. The Prime Minister takes office by attending the Monarch in private audience, and after Kissing Hands that appointment is immediately effective without any other formality or instrument. { Brazier, p. 312. } In a &quot; hung parliament &quot;, in which no party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch has an increased degree of latitude in choosing the individual likely to command most support, but it would usually be the leader of the largest party. { Waldron, pp.59–60 } [ http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx Queen and Prime Minister 18 June 2010 Official website of the British Monarchy ] Since 1945, there have only been two hung parliaments. The first followed the February 1974 general election when Harold Wilson was appointed Prime Minister after Edward Heath resigned the post following his failure to form a coalition. Although Wilson&apos;s Labour Party did not have a majority, they were the largest party. The second followed the May 2010 general election, in which the Conservatives (the largest party) and Liberal Democrats agreed to form the first coalition government since World War II. [ Dissolution of Parliament ] In 1950 the King&apos;s Private Secretary writing pseudonymously to the Times newspaper asserted a constitutional convention: according to the Lascelles Principles, if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse, and would do so under three conditions. When Prime Minister Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition. The resulting general election gave Wilson a small majority.

The last monarch to remove a Prime Minister was William IV, who dismissed Lord Melbourne in 1834. [ http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29451 William IV 10 October 2008 Brock Michael September 2004; online edition, January 2008 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ] { (Subscription required) } The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 removed the monarch&apos;s authority to dissolve Parliament. [ Royal Prerogative ] [ Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom ] Some of the government&apos;s executive authority is theoretically and nominally vested in the Sovereign and is known as the Royal Prerogative. The monarch acts within the constraints of convention and precedent, only exercising prerogative on the advice of ministers responsible to Parliament, often through the Prime Minister or Privy Council. [ Durkin, Mary; Gay, Oonagh http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf PDF The Royal Prerogative 10 October 2008 21 December 2005 House of Commons Library http://web.archive.org/web/20080625170825/http%3A//www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03861.pdf 25 June 2008 ] In practice, prerogative powers are only exercised on the Prime Minister&apos;s advice—the Prime Minister, and not the Sovereign, has control. The monarch holds a weekly audience with the Prime Minister. The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the decisions of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet (providing they command the support of the House). In Bagehot&apos;s words: &quot; the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy  ... three rights—the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn. &quot; { Bagehot, p.75 } Although the Royal Prerogative is extensive and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have fallen out of use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a parliamentary report, &quot; The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers &quot;, and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation. [ PASC Publishes Government Defence of its Sweeping Prerogative Powers UK Parliament http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee/pasc_19.cfm 2002 10 October 2008 ] The Royal Prerogative includes the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct the actions of the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is commander in chief of the Armed Forces (the Royal Navy, the British Army, and the Royal Air Force ), accredits British High Commissioner s and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. It is the prerogative of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch&apos;s summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government&apos;s legislative agenda. [ http://www.parliament.uk/faq/lords_stateopening.cfm About Parliament: State Opening of Parliament 27 April 2008 2008 UK Parliament ] Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/6110930.stm A Guide to Prorogation 27 April 2008 7 November 2007 BBC News ] Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and is followed by a general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons vote to hold an early election. Before a bill passed by the legislative Houses can become law, the Royal Assent (the monarch&apos;s approval) is required. { Crabbe, p.17 } In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82104.stm Royal Assent 27 April 2008 24 January 2006 BBC News ] The monarch has a similar relationship with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

[ http://new.wales.gov.uk/legislation/govwalesact2006/briefoverview?lang%3Den Brief overview – Government of Wales Act 2006 30 August 2011 Welsh Assembly Government ] In Scottish matters, the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Scottish Government. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The Sovereign can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. [ http://www.uk-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980047_en_2 Northern Ireland Act 1998 10 October 2008 Office of Public Sector Information ] The Sovereign is deemed the &quot; fount of justice &quot;; although the Sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch&apos;s behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the Sovereign &quot; can do no wrong &quot;; the monarch cannot be prosecuted for criminal offences. The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government), but not lawsuits against the monarch personally. The Sovereign exercises the &quot; prerogative of mercy &quot;, which is used to pardon convicted offenders or reduce sentences. The monarch is the &quot; fount of honour &quot;, the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom. The Crown creates all peerage s, appoints members of the orders of chivalry, grants knighthoods and awards other honours. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/oct/21/uk.freedomofinformation Mystery lifted on Queen&apos;s powers 9 May 2008 Dyer Clare 21 October 2003 The Guardian ] Although peerages and most other honours are granted on the advice of the Prime Minister, some honours are within the personal gift of the Sovereign, and are not granted on ministerial advice. The monarch alone appoints members of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of Merit.

Alfred the Great secured Wessex, achieved dominance over western Mercia, and assumed the title &quot; King of the English &quot;. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.12–13 and 31 } His grandson Athelstan was the first king to rule over a unitary kingdom roughly corresponding to the present borders of England, though its constituent parts retained strong regional identities. The 11th century saw England become more stable, despite a number of wars with the Danes, which resulted in a Danish monarchy for one generation. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.13–17 } William, Duke of Normandy&apos;s conquest of England in 1066 was crucial in terms of both political and social change. The new monarch continued the centralisation of power begun in the Anglo-Saxon period, while the Feudal System continued to develop. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.102–127 } { Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Norman Conquest of 1066. } William I was succeeded by two of his sons: William II, then Henry I. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter Matilda (his only surviving child) as his heir. Following Henry&apos;s death in 1135 one of William I&apos;s grandsons, Stephen, laid claim to the throne, and took power with the support of most of the barons. Matilda challenged his reign; as a result England descended into a period of disorder known as the Anarchy. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power but agreed to a compromise under which Matilda&apos;s son Henry would succeed him. Henry accordingly became the first monarch of the Angevin or Plantagenet dynasty as Henry II in 1154. { Fraser, pp.30–46 } The reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs Richard I and John. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom. Upon Henry&apos;s death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, as he left to fight in the Crusades. He was killed besieging a castle, and John succeeded him. John&apos;s reign was marked by conflict with the barons, particularly over the limits of royal power. In 1215 the barons coerced the king into issuing the Magna Carta ( Latin for &quot; Great Charter &quot; ) to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility. Soon afterwards further disagreements plunged England into a civil war known as the First Barons&apos; War. The war came to an abrupt end after John died in 1216, leaving the Crown to his nine-year-old son Henry III. { Fraser, pp.54–74 } Later in Henry&apos;s reign, Simon de Montfort led the barons in another rebellion, beginning the Second Barons&apos; War. The war ended in a clear royalist victory, and in the death of many rebels, but not before the king had agreed to summon a parliament in 1265. { Fraser, pp.77–78 } The next monarch, Edward I ( &quot; Edward Longshanks &quot; ), was far more successful in maintaining royal power, and was responsible for the conquest of Wales. He attempted to establish English domination of Scotland. However, gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor, Edward II, who also faced conflict with the nobility. { Fraser, pp.79–93 } Edward II was, in 1311, forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of baronial &quot; ordainers &quot;; however, military victories helped him regain control in 1322. { Ashley, pp.595–597 } Nevertheless, in 1327 Edward was deposed and then murdered by his wife Isabella. His 14-year-old son became Edward III. Edward III claimed the French Crown, setting off the Hundred Years&apos; War between England and France. His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374 all the gains had been lost. Edward&apos;s reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament, which came to be divided into two Houses. In 1377 Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king. { Fraser, pp.96–115 } Henry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; hence, his dynasty was known as the House of Lancaster. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future Henry V. Henry V&apos;s own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years&apos; War in France. Although he was victorious, his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son Henry VI on the throne, and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule. { Fraser, pp.118–130 } The unpopularity of Henry&apos;s counsellors and his belligerent consort, Margaret of Anjou, as well as his own ineffectual leadership, led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was Richard, Duke of York. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son Edward IV led the Yorkists to victory in 1461. The Wars of the Roses, nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son Edward V and brother Richard III. Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by Henry Tudor, in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the Battle of Bosworth Field. { Fraser, pp.133–165 } Now as King Henry VII, Henry Tudor neutralised the remaining Yorkist forces, partly by marrying Elizabeth of York, a Yorkist heir. Through skill and ability, Henry re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end. { Cannon and Griffiths, p.295; Fraser, pp.168–176 } The reign of the second Tudor king, Henry VIII, was one of great political change. Religious upheaval and disputes with the Pope led the monarch to break from the Roman Catholic Church and to establish the Church of England (the Anglican Church). { Fraser, pp.179–189 } Wales, which had been conquered centuries earlier but had remained a separate dominion, was annexed to England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.194, 265, 309 } Henry VIII&apos;s son and successor, the young Edward VI, continued with further religious reforms but his early death in 1553 precipitated a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister Mary to succeed, and therefore drew up a will designating Lady Jane Grey as his heiress. Jane&apos;s reign however lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her, and declared herself the lawful Sovereign. Mary I pursued disastrous wars in France and attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism, in the process burning Protestants at the stake as heretics. She died in 1558, and was succeeded by her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth I. England returned to Protestantism, and continued its growth into a major world power by building its navy and exploring the New World. { Ashley, pp.636–647 and Fraser, pp.190–211 } [ Scottish monarchy ] [ List of Scottish monarchs ] In Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of the Roman empire from Britain in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the Picts in the north east, the Britons in the south, including the Kingdom of Strathclyde, and the Gael s or Scotti (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish petty kingdom of Dál Riata in the west. Kenneth MacAlpin is traditionally viewed as the first king of a united Scotland (known as Scotia to writers in Latin, or Alba to the Scots). { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.1–12, 35 } The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were absorbed. Early Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly; instead the custom of tanistry was followed, where the monarchy alternated between different branches of the House of Alpin. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle. { Weir, pp.164–177 } In 1005, Malcolm II ascended the throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and when he died in 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, Duncan I, instead of a cousin, as had been usual. In 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of Macbeth, who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan&apos;s son Malcolm. The following year, after killing Macbeth&apos;s stepson Lulach, Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III. { Ashley, pp.390–395 } With a further series of battles and deposings, five of Malcolm&apos;s sons as well as one of his brothers successively became king. Eventually, the Crown came to his youngest son, David. David was succeeded by his grandsons Malcolm IV, and then by William the Lion, the longest-reigning King of Scots before the Union of the Crowns. { Ashley, pp.400–407 and Weir, pp.185–198 } William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England but when the rebellion failed, William was captured by the English. In exchange for his release, William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord. The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189, in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades. { Cannon and Griffiths, p.170 } William died in 1214, and was succeeded by his son Alexander II. Alexander II, as well as his successor Alexander III, attempted to take over the Western Isles, which were still under the overlordship of Norway. During the reign of Alexander III, Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland; the ensuing Treaty of Perth recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas. { Ashley, pp.407–409 and Cannon and Griffiths, pp.187, 196 } Alexander III&apos;s unexpected death in a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander&apos;s three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, Margaret. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between 13 rival claimants to the throne. A court was set up and after two years of deliberation, it pronounced John Balliol to be king. However, Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing Wars of Scottish Independence, Scotland had no monarch, until Robert the Bruce declared himself king in 1306. { Ashley, pp.409–412 } Robert&apos;s efforts to control Scotland culminated in success, and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328. However, only one year later, Robert died and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, David II. On the pretext of restoring John Balliol&apos;s rightful heir, Edward Balliol, the English again invaded in 1332. During the next four years, Balliol was crowned, deposed, restored, deposed, restored, and deposed until he eventually settled in England, and David remained king for the next 35 years. { Ashley, pp.549–552 } David II died childless in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew Robert II of the House of Stuart. The reigns of both Robert II and his successor, Robert III, were marked by a general decline in royal power. When Robert III died in 1406, regents had to rule the country; the monarch, Robert III&apos;s son James I, had been taken captive by the English. Having paid a large ransom, James returned to Scotland in 1424; to restore his authority, he used ruthless measures, including the execution of several of his enemies. He was assassinated by a group of nobles. James II continued his father&apos;s policies by subduing influential noblemen but he was killed in an accident at the age of thirty, and a council of regents again assumed power. James III was defeated in a battle against rebellious Scottish earls in 1488, leading to another boy-king: James IV. { Ashley, pp.552–565 } In 1513, James IV launched an invasion of England, attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at Flodden Field; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, James V, was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, Mary. Once again, a regency was established. Mary, a Roman Catholic, reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland. Due to the efforts of reformers such as John Knox, a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, Lord Darnley, in 1565. After Lord Darnley&apos;s assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of Darnley&apos;s murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son James VI, who was brought up as a Protestant. Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English Queen Elizabeth I. { Ashley, pp.567–575 } [ Personal union and republican phase ] In 1603 James VI and I became the first monarch to rule over England, Scotland, and Ireland together. Elizabeth&apos;s death in 1603 ended Tudor rule in England. Since she had no children, she was succeeded by the Scottish monarch James VI, who was the great-grandson of Henry VIII &apos;s older sister and hence Elizabeth&apos;s first cousin twice removed. James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the &quot; Union of the Crowns &quot;. Although England and Scotland were in personal union under one monarch—James I became the first monarch to style himself &quot; King of Great Britain and Ireland &quot; in 1604 { Royal Arms, Styles, and Titles of Great Britain: Westminster, 20 October 1604 } —they remained separate kingdoms. James I&apos;s successor, Charles I, experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers, especially the power to impose taxes. He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, unilaterally levying taxes, and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish Presbyterians and the English Puritan s ). In 1642, the conflict between King and Parliament reached its climax and the English Civil War began. { Fraser, pp.214–231 } The war culminated in the execution of the king in 1649, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the establishment of a republic known as the Commonwealth of England. In 1653, Oliver Cromwell, the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself Lord Protector (effectively becoming a military dictator, but refusing the title of king). Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son Richard. The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing; he soon resigned. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.393–400 } The lack of clear leadership led to civil and military unrest, and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy. In 1660, the monarchy was restored when Charles I&apos;s son Charles II was declared king. { Fraser, p.232 } Charles II&apos;s reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England. Charles had no legitimate children, and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, James, Duke of York. A parliamentary effort to exclude James from the line of succession arose; the &quot; Petitioners &quot;, who supported exclusion, became the Whig Party, whereas the &quot; Abhorrers &quot;, who opposed exclusion, became the Tory Party. The Exclusion Bill failed; on several occasions, Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass. After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681, Charles ruled without a Parliament until his death in 1685. When James succeeded Charles, he pursued a policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics, thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects. Many opposed James&apos;s decisions to maintain a large standing army, to appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices, and to imprison Church of England clerics who challenged his policies. As a result, a group of Protestants known as the Immortal Seven invited James II&apos;s daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange to depose the king. William obliged, arriving in England on 5 November 1688 to great public support. Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials, James fled the realm and William and Mary (rather than James II&apos;s Catholic son ) were declared joint Sovereigns of England, Scotland and Ireland. { Fraser, pp.242–245 } James&apos;s overthrow, known as the Glorious Revolution, was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The Bill of Rights 1689 affirmed parliamentary supremacy, and declared that the English people held certain rights, including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights required future monarchs to be Protestants, and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary&apos;s sister Anne would inherit the Crown. Mary died childless in 1694, leaving William as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of Anne&apos;s children had died, leaving her as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament was afraid that the former James II or his supporters, known as Jacobites, might attempt to reclaim the throne. Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded James and his Catholic relations from the succession and made William&apos;s nearest Protestant relations, the family of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, next in line to the throne after his sister-in-law Anne. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.439–440 } Soon after the passage of the Act, William III died, leaving the Crown to Anne. [ After the 1707 Acts of Union ] England and Scotland were united as Great Britain under Queen Anne in 1707. [ List of British monarchs ] After Anne&apos;s accession, the problem of the succession re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia&apos;s family as the next heirs, passed the Act of Security, threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the Act of Union 1707, under which England and Scotland were united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain, with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.447–448 } In 1714, Queen Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, and Sophia&apos;s son, George I, Elector of Hanover, who consolidated his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government than many of his British predecessors, but retained control over his German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.460–469 } Power shifted towards George&apos;s ministers, especially to Sir Robert Walpole, who is often considered the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, although the title was not then in use. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/walpole_robert.shtml Sir Robert Walpole 14 October 2008 BBC, ] The next monarch, George II, witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746, when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. During the long reign of his grandson, George III, Britain&apos;s American colonies were lost, the former colonies having formed the United States of America, but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created by the Act of Union 1800. { Ashley, pp.677–680 } The union of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom occurred in 1801 during the reign of King George III. From 1811 to 1820 George III suffered a severe bout of what is now believed to be porphyria, an illness rendering him incapable of ruling. His son, the future George IV, ruled in his stead as Prince Regent. During the Regency and his own reign, the power of the monarchy declined and by the time of his successor, William IV, the monarch was no longer able to effectively interfere with parliamentary power. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, and appointed a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. In the ensuing elections, however, Peel lost. The King had no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne. During William IV&apos;s reign the Reform Act 1832, which reformed parliamentary representation, was passed. Together with others passed later in the century, the Act led to an expansion of the electoral franchise, and the rise of the House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament. { Cannon and Griffiths, pp.530–550 } The final transition to a constitutional monarchy was made during the long reign of William IV&apos;s successor, Victoria. As a woman, Victoria could not rule Hanover, which only permitted succession in the male line, so the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end. The Victorian era was marked by great cultural change, technological progress, and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world&apos;s foremost powers. In recognition of British rule over India, Victoria was declared Empress of India in 1876. However, her reign was also marked by increased support for the republican movement, due in part to Victoria&apos;s permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of her husband in 1861. { Fraser, pp.305–306 } Victoria&apos;s son, Edward VII, became the first monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1901. In 1917, the next monarch, George V, changed &quot; Saxe-Coburg and Gotha &quot; to &quot; Windsor &quot; due to the anti-German sympathies aroused by the First World War. George V&apos;s reign was marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom, and the Irish Free State, an independent nation, in 1922. { Fraser, pp.314–333 } [ Shared monarchy ] Map of the British Empire in 1921 Map of the Commonwealth realms today During the twentieth century, the Commonwealth of Nations evolved from the British Empire. Prior to 1926, the British Crown reigned over the British Empire collectively, the Dominions and Crown colonies were subordinate to the United Kingdom. The Balfour Declaration of 1926 gave complete self-government to the Dominions, effectively creating a system whereby a single monarch operated independently in each separate Dominion. The concept was solidified by the Statute of Westminster 1931, [ http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/westmins.htm Statute of Westminster 1931 20 April 2008 11 October 2001 Government of Nova Scotia ] which has been likened to &quot; a treaty among the Commonwealth countries &quot;. { Justice Rouleau in O&apos;Donohue v.

[ Succession ] [ Succession to the British throne Coronation of the British monarch ] The relationship between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. Succession is governed by statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707. The rules of succession may only be changed by an Act of Parliament; it is not possible for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession. The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I. Upon the death of the Sovereign, his or her heir immediately and automatically succeeds (hence the phrase &quot; The King is dead. Long live the King! &quot; ), and the accession of the sovereign is publicly proclaimed by an Accession Council that meets at St. James&apos;s Palace. [ http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Accession/Accession.aspx Accession 14 May 2009 Official website of the British Monarchy ] The monarch is crowned in Westminster Abbey, normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

However, since the monarch is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the law which prohibits a Roman Catholic from acceding to the throne – which originated as a result of the English and Scots&apos; distrust of Roman Catholicism during the late 17th century – would remain. Only individuals who are Protestants may inherit the Crown. Roman Catholics and spouses of Roman Catholics are prohibited from succeeding.

The palaces belong to the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers, and cannot be sold by the monarch. [ http://www.hrp.org.uk/aboutus/whoweare/history.aspx A brief history of Historic Royal Palaces 20 April 2008 Historic Royal Palaces ] Sandringham House in Norfolk and Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire are privately owned by the Queen. [ Style ] [ Style of the British Sovereign ] The present Sovereign&apos;s full style and title is &quot; Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith &quot;. { Royal proclamation reciting the altered Style and Titles of the Crown } The title &quot; Head of the Commonwealth &quot; is held by the Queen personally, and is not vested in the British Crown. Pope Leo X first granted the title &quot; Defender of the Faith &quot; to King Henry VIII in 1521, rewarding him for his support of the Papacy during the early years of the Protestant Reformation, particularly for his book the Defence of the Seven Sacraments. { Fraser, p.180 } After Henry broke from the Roman Church, Pope Paul III revoked the grant, but Parliament passed a law authorising its continued use. [ http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/01_kingstyle_1521.php Royal Styles: 1521–1553 10 October 2008 18 August 2007 Archontology ] The Sovereign is known as &quot; His Majesty &quot; or &quot; Her Majesty &quot;. The form &quot; Britannic Majesty &quot; appears in international treaties and on passports to differentiate the British monarch from foreign rulers. The monarch chooses his or her regnal name, not necessarily his or her first name— King George VI, King Edward VII and Queen Victoria did not use their first names. If only one monarch has used a particular name, no ordinal is used; for example, Queen Victoria is not known as &quot; Victoria I &quot;, and ordinals are not used for English monarchs who reigned before the Norman conquest of England. The question of whether numbering for British monarchs is based on previous English or Scottish monarchs was raised in 1953 when Scottish nationalists challenged the Queen&apos;s use of &quot; Elizabeth II &quot;, on the grounds that there had never been an &quot; Elizabeth I &quot; in Scotland. In MacCormick v. Lord Advocate, the Scottish Court of Session ruled against the plaintiffs, finding that the Queen&apos;s title was a matter of her own choice and prerogative. The Home Secretary told the House of Commons that monarchs since the Acts of Union had consistently used the higher of the English and Scottish ordinals, which in the applicable four cases has been the English ordinal. { Royal Titles Bill. } { Hansard, 3 March 1953, vol. 512, col. 251 } The Prime Minister confirmed this practice, but noted that &quot; neither The Queen nor her advisers could seek to bind their successors &quot;. { Royal Style and Title. Hansard, 15 April 1953, vol. 514, col. 199 } Future monarchs will apply this policy. { Debrett&apos;s, 2008 edition, p. 43 } Traditionally, the signature of the monarch includes their regnal name but not ordinal, followed by the letter R, which stands for rex or regina ( Latin for king and queen, respectively). The present monarch&apos;s signature is &quot; Elizabeth R &quot;. From 1877 until 1948 reigning monarchs added the letter I to their signatures, for imperator or imperatrix (emperor or empress in Latin), due to their status as Emperor or Empress of India. For example, Queen Victoria signed as &quot; Victoria RI &quot; from 1877. [ Arms ] [ Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom ] The Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom are &quot; Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or [for England]; II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules [for Scotland]; III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent [for Ireland] &quot;. The supporters are the lion and the unicorn; the motto is &quot; Dieu et mon droit &quot; (French: &quot; God and my Right &quot; ). Surrounding the shield is a representation of a Garter bearing the motto of the Chivalric order of the same name; &quot; Honi soit qui mal y pense &quot;. ( Old French : &quot; Shame be to him who thinks evil of it &quot; ). In Scotland, the monarch uses an alternative form of the arms in which quarters I and IV represent Scotland, II England, and III Ireland. The mottoes are &quot; In Defens &quot; (an abbreviated form of the Scots &quot; In My Defens God Me Defend &quot; ) and the motto of the Order of the Thistle; &quot; Nemo me impune lacessit &quot;. ( Latin : &quot; No-one provokes me with impunity &quot; ); the supporters are the unicorn and lion, who support both the escutcheon and lance s, from which fly the flags of Scotland and England. { Coat of arms of } { Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom. The design, in use since the accession of } { Queen Victoria in 1837, features the } { arms of England in the first and fourth quarters, } { Scotland in the second, and } { Ireland in the third. In } { Scotland a separate version is used (shown right) whereby the Arms of Scotland take precedence. } The monarch&apos;s official flag in the United Kingdom is the Royal Standard, which depicts the Royal Arms. It is flown only from buildings, vessels and vehicles in which the Sovereign is present.
