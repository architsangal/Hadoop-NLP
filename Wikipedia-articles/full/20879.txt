The whiskey-based Manhattan is one of five cocktails named for one of New York City&apos;s five boroughs, but is perhaps most closely related to the Brooklyn cocktail { http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/02/the-brooklyn-cocktail-rye-maraschino-vermouth.html }, a mix utilizing dry vermouth and Maraschino liqueur in place of the Manhattan&apos;s sweet vermouth, as well as Amer Picon in place of the Manhattan&apos;s traditional bitters. It is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury &apos;s classic The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. [ Origin and history ] A popular history suggests that the drink originated at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the early 1870s, where it was invented by Dr. Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, Winston &apos;s mother) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated— &quot; the Manhattan cocktail &quot;. { Holiday Cocktail Party from CocktailTimes.com } [ Patrick Murphy&apos;s The Barman&apos;s Corner Buckeye Tavern 15 March 1945 pg. 6, col. 2 ] { qtd. in } [ http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2%3Dind0010d%26amp%3BL%3Dads-l%26amp%3BD%3D1%26amp%3BP%3D15743 Moscow Mule; Molotov Cocktail; Manhattan Cocktail 28 October 2000 The Linguist List American Dialect Society 2010-03-10 ] However, Lady Randolph was in France at the time and pregnant, so the story is likely a fiction. { Winston Churchill, My Early Life } The original &quot; Manhattan cocktail &quot; was a mix of &quot; American Whiskey, Italian Vermouth and Angostura bitters &quot;.

By one account it was invented in the 1860s by a bartender named Black at a bar on Broadway near Houston Street.

In it, he details a drink containing 2 dashes of gum, 2 dashes of bitters, 1 dash of absinthe, 2/3 portion of whiskey and 1/3 portion of vermouth. The same cocktail appears listed as a &quot; Tennessee Cocktail &quot; in Shake &apos;em Up! by V. Elliott and P. Strong, copyright 1930 (p. 39): &quot; Two parts of whiskey, one part of Italian Vermouth and a dash of bitters poured over ice and stirred vigorously. &quot; [ Traditions ] On the small North Frisian island of Föhr, the Manhattan cocktail is a standard drink at almost every cafe restaurant, and &quot; get together &quot; of locals. { Essen und Trinken from Föhr-Digital.de } The story goes, that many of the people of Föhr emigrated to Manhattan during deep sea fishing trips, took a liking to the drink, and brought it back to Föhr with them. The drink is usually mixed 1 part (the &apos;perfect&apos; is said to be half white/half red) vermouth to 2 parts whiskey, with a dash of bitters, served ice cold, in an ice cold glass, or with ice and a cherry garnish. [ Variations ] A Manhattan. Traditional views insist that a Manhattan be made with rye whiskey. However, nowadays, it is more often than not made with bourbon or Canadian whisky (both of which may contain no rye at all.). The Manhattan is subject to considerable variation and innovation, and is often a way for the best bartenders to show off their creativity. Some shake the ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker instead of stirring it, creating a froth on the surface of the drink. Angostura are the classic bitters, but orange bitters, Peychaud&apos;s Bitters, and even the lack of any bitters, may be used; using Fernet-Branca yields what is called a [ Fanciulli ] cocktail.

A lemon peel may be used as garnish. Some add juice from the cherry jar or Maraschino liqueur to the cocktail for additional sweetness and color. Originally, bitters were considered an integral part of any cocktail, as the ingredient that differentiated a cocktail from a sling.
