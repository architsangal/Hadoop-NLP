[ Vertebrate Zoology Checklist of Chelonians of the World 2007 Fritz Uwe Peter Havaš 57 2 207 - 208 http://www.cnah.org/pdf_files/851.pdf http://www.webcitation.org/5v20ztMND 2010-12-17 29 May 2012 ] The red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is a subspecies of pond slider. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States and also popular in the rest of the world. It is native only to the southern United States, but has become established in other places because of pet releases and has become an invasive species in many introduced areas, like California, where it outcompetes the native western pond turtle. [ Name ] Red-eared sliders are popular pets around the world. Red-eared sliders get their name from the distinctive red patch of skin around their ears. The &quot; slider &quot; part of their name comes from their ability to slide off rocks and logs and into the water quickly. This species was previously known as Troost&apos;s turtle in honor of an American herpetologist; Trachemys scripta troostii is now the scientific name for another subspecies, the Cumberland slider. [ Behavior ] { sunlamp } Red-eared sliders are almost entirely aquatic, but leave the water to bask in the sun and lay eggs. These reptile s are deceptively fast and are also decent swimmers. They hunt for prey and will attempt to capture it when the opportunity presents itself. They are aware of predator s and people, and generally shy away from them. The red-eared slider is known to frantically slide off rocks and logs when approached. Contrary to the popular misconception, red-eared sliders do not have saliva. They, like most aquatic turtles, have fixed tongues, so they must eat their food in water.

The red stripe on each side of the head distinguishes the red-eared slider from all other North American species. The carapace (top shell) is oval and flattened (especially in the male), has a weak keel that is more pronounced in the young, and the rear marginal scutes are notched. The carapace usually consists of a dark green background with light and dark highly variable markings. The plastron (bottom shell) is yellow with dark, paired, irregular markings in the center of most scutes. The plastron is highly variable in pattern. The head, legs, and tail are green with fine, yellow, irregular lines. Some dimorphism occurs between males and females. Male turtles are usually smaller than females but their tail is much longer and thicker. [ http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Trachemys_scripta.html Animal Diversity Web: &apos; &amp; #39;Tachemys scripta&apos; &amp; #39; Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu 2010-03-16 ] Claws are elongated in males to allow a better grip on the carapace of females during mating. Typically, the cloacal opening of the female is at or under the rear edge of the carapace, while the male&apos;s opening occurs beyond the edge of the carapace. Older males can sometimes have a melanistic coloration, being a dark grayish-olive green, with markings being very subdued. The red stripe on the sides of the head may be difficult to see or be absent. [ Diet ] Red-eared sliders are omnivore s and eat a variety of animal and plant materials in the wild including, but not limited to, fish, crayfish, carrion, tadpole s, snails, crickets, mealworms, wax worms, aquatic insects and numerous aquatic plant species. The captive diet for pet red-eared sliders should be a varied diet consisting of invertebrates such as worms, aquatic and land plants, and other natural foods. They should never be fed commercial dog food or cat food. Calcium can be supplemented by adding pieces of cuttlebone to the diet, or with commercially available vitamin and mineral supplements. A nutritious food readily accepted by young turtles is baby clams soaked in krill oil covered with powdered coral calcium. Younger turtles tend to be more carnivorous (to obtain more animal protein) than adults. As they grow larger and older, they become increasingly herbivorous. Live foods are particularly enjoyed and add to the quality of life of captive turtles. Providing a wide variety of foods is the key to success with captive red-eared sliders. For pet red eared slider turtles, one can feed them treats occasionlly, like small creek fish, store bought turtle food, cucumbers, or tomatoes. [ Gulf Coast Turtle and Tortoise Society http://www.gctts.org/node/72 Water Turtle Diet &amp; Care Sheet; Gulf Coast Turtle &amp; Tortoise Society Gctts.org 2010-03-16 ] [ Hibernation ] Reptiles do not hibernate, but actually they brumate, becoming less active, but occasionally rising for food or air. Brumation can occur in varying degrees. Red-eared sliders brumate over the winter at the bottom of pond s or shallow lake s; they become inactive, generally, in October, when temperatures fall below [ 10 C F ]. Individuals usually brumate under water. They have also been found under banks and hollow stumps and rocks. In warmer winter climates, they can become active and come to the surface for basking. When the temperature begins to drop again, however, they will quickly return to a brumation state. Sliders will generally come up for food in early March to as late as the end of April. Red-eared sliders kept captive indoors should not brumate. To prevent attempted brumation in an aquarium, lights should be on for 12–14 hours per day and the water temperature should be maintained between [ 24 and 27 C F ]. Water temperatures must be under [ 13 C F ] for aquatic turtles to brumate properly. Controlling temperature changes to simulate natural seasonal fluctuations encourages mating behavior. [ Reproduction ] Hatching turtle with its egg-tooth. Female laying eggs in a nest she dug out with her hind legs Courtship and mating activities for red-eared sliders usually occur between March and July, and take place under water. The male swims toward the female and flutters or vibrates the back side of his long claws on and around her face and head. The female swims toward the male and, if she is receptive, sinks to the bottom for mating. If the female is not receptive, she may become aggressive towards the male. The courtship can take up to 45 minutes, but the mating itself usually takes only 10 to 15 minutes. [ April 2008 ] Sometimes a male will appear to be courting another male. This is actually a sign of dominance, and they may begin to fight. Juveniles may display the courtship dance, but until the turtles are five years of age, they are not mature and are unable to mate. [ April 2008 ] After mating, the female spends extra time basking to keep her eggs warm. She may also have a change of diet, eating only certain foods or not eating as much as she normally would. Mating begins in May and egg-laying occurs in May through early July. A female might lay from two to 30 eggs, with larger females having larger clutches. One female can lay up to five clutches in the same year, and clutches are usually spaced twelve to thirty-six days apart. [ http://nlbif.eti.uva.nl/bis/turtles.php?selected%3Dbeschrijving%26amp%3Bmenuentry%3Dsoorten%26amp%3Brecord%3DTrachemys%20scripta Trachemys scripta; Turtles of the World by Ernst, et al Nlbif.eti.uva.nl 2010-03-16 ] The time between mating and egg laying can be days or weeks. [ Hatching ] Eggs hatch 60 to 90 days after they have been laid. Late season hatchlings may spend the winter in the nest and emerge when the weather warms in the spring. Just prior to hatching, the egg contains 50% turtle and 50% egg sac. A new hatchling breaks open its eggs with its egg-tooth, which falls out about an hour after hatching. This egg tooth never grows back. Hatchlings may stay inside their eggshells after hatching for the first day or two. When a hatchling decides to leave the shell, it has a small sac protruding from its plastron. The yolk sac is vital and provides nourishment while visible and several days after it has been absorbed into the turtle&apos;s belly. Damage or motion enough to allow air into the turtle&apos;s body results in death. This is the main reason for marking the top of turtle eggs if their relocation for any reason is required. An egg that has been turned upside down will eventually terminate the embryo growth by the sac smothering the embryo. If it manages to reach term, the turtle will try to flip over with the yolk sac, which allows air into the body cavity and death follows. The other fatal danger is water getting into the body cavity before the sac is absorbed completely and the opening has not completely healed yet. It takes 21 days between the egg opening until water entry. The sac must be absorbed, and does not fall out. The split may be noticeable in the hatchling&apos;s plastron on turtles found in the field, indicating the age of the turtle to be about three weeks old. The split must heal on its own before allowing the turtle to swim. However, this does not mean there is no need for moisture throughout the first three weeks of life outside of the egg. A good idea is to place the hatchlings on moist paper towels. The eggs should be kept on the moist towels from the day they are laid (dig them up an hour after being laid) and covered with toweling until they hatch and can swim. The turtle can also suck the water it needs from the toweling. Red-ear slider eggs matriculate in South Florida in 91 days while in New York City the egg takes 102 days. Turtles which were relocated exhibited this effect with constancy. [ April 2008 ] [ As pets ] &apos;&apos;Trachemys scripta elegans&apos;&apos; The red-eared slider is the most common type of water turtle kept as pets. [ http://turtlesource.webs.com/sliderguide.html Turtle Source&apos;s Slider Guide - Introduction - Is a slider right for you? Turtlesource.webs.com 2009-12-06 ] As with other turtles, tortoises and box turtles, individuals that survive their first year or two can be expected to live generally around thirty years. Red-eared sliders can be quite aggressive—especially when food is involved. Behavior is usually noted to become this way when fed live food. If being kept as a pet, care must be taken to prevent injury or even death of its smaller tankmates. Additional care is needed if shrimp are used as food. Smaller red-eared sliders less than a year old have been known to choke on the shells of the shrimp and suffer from lung puncture. [ United States federal regulations on commercial distribution ] A line of basking red-eared sliders faces an inquisitive mallard. A 1975 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation bans the sale (for general commercial and public use) of turtle eggs and turtles with a carapace length of less than [ 4 in mm ]. This regulation comes under the Public Health Service Act, and is enforced by the FDA in cooperation with state and local health jurisdictions. The ban was enacted because of the public health impact of turtle-associated Salmonella. Turtles and turtle eggs found to be offered for sale in violation of this provision are subject to destruction in accordance with FDA procedures. A fine of up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to one year is the penalty for those who refuse to comply with a valid final demand for destruction of such turtles or their eggs. { GCTTS FAQ: &quot; 4 Inch Law &quot;, actually an FDA regulation } Many stores and flea markets still sell small turtles due to an exception in the FDA regulation which allows turtles under [ 4 in mm ] to be sold &quot; for bona fide scientific, educational, or exhibitional purposes, other than use as pets. &quot; { Turtles intrastate and interstate requirements; FDA Regulation, Sec. 1240.62, page 678 part d1. } As with many other animals and inanimate objects, the risk of Salmonella exposure can be reduced by following basic rules of cleanliness. Small children must be taught to wash their hands immediately after they finish &quot; playing &quot; with the turtle, feeding it, or changing the water. [ US state law ] Some states have other laws and regulations regarding possession of red-eared slider because they can be an invasive species where they are not native and have been introduced through the pet trade. Now, it is illegal in Florida to sell any wild type red-eared slider, as they interbreed with the local yellow-bellied slider population – Trachemys scripta scripta is another subspecies of pond slider s, and intergrades typically combine the markings of the two subspecies. However, unusual color varieties such as albino and pastel red-eared sliders, which are derived from captive breeding, are still allowed for sale. { Turtle ban begins today; New state law, newszap.com, 2007-07-01. Retrieved 2007-07-06. } [ Ideal conditions in captivity ] { goldfish and } { koi } [ 78 - 82 F C ] [ 1 in cm ] [ 5 in cm ] [ 8 in cm ] High water quality - Even with powerful filters, frequent water changes are needed. The water should be heated and maintained at approximately. Room temperature water is not sufficient and can lead to disfigurement and respiratory ailments. Ultraviolet B lighting is required for indoor turtles. While an ideal habitat provides real, unfiltered sunlight, UVB lighting is a necessity in habitats without. Glass or plastic between the bulb and the basking area will prohibit natural and artificial UVB light from entering the habitat. The bulb should be placed above the turtle&apos;s basking area. Hibernation or brumation is not possible indoors at room temperature. Twelve hours of light per day helps prevent brumation. Mature female turtles not kept with males can lay infertile eggs. Females can also remain fertile for several years after a mating and lay fertile eggs. Mature females must have a desirable land area in which to lay eggs. Laying eggs in water is not healthy. Dystocia ( egg binding ), the inability to lay eggs due to tank confinement with insufficient or undesirable land areas, shell deformities or nutritional imbalances, is potentially fatal. Groups of turtles should have sex ratios of at least two females per male to avoid mating pressure, stress and injuries from overmating. Red-eared sliders in captivity (indoor) should be kept in large terrariums. A 10-20 gallon (40-80 liter) tank is sufficient for hatchling red-eared sliders, although they will quickly outgrow them. Much larger tanks are required for adult turtles. A commonly-used guideline is 10 gallons (40 l) of water per of shell (example: a turtle of and a turtle of together need 130 gallons (500 l) of space). Red-eared sliders should not be kept in a tank with gravel or decorations that the turtle can fit in its mouth, as this can lead to bowel impaction and death. Commonly and cheaply available 20-grit sand (pool filter sand) makes an ideal substrate. Basking platforms or stabilized stacks of rocks should be provided so red-eared sliders can climb out of the water and dry off completely. The ideal basking surface temperature is 85-95°F. [ Environment ] large male swimming in a Toronto small lake. Red-eared sliders enjoy large areas where they are free to swim. These turtles also require a basking area, where they can completely leave the water and enjoy the light provided for them. UVB heat lamps are usually the best option and most common among those taking proper care of their turtles. However, UVB heat lamps have not been proven to have the same quality as direct, unfiltered UV rays from the sun. Turtles are recommended to be given time outdoors on days with more sun, even if this is only possible in the spring and summer. For the basking area, the best choice is a dirt or sand area, if at all possible. Since these turtles like to climb, flat rocks also make good basking areas, as well as provide areas for entertainment. Plant life, either artificial or real, also increases red-eared slider quality of life, mimicking their natural environment. The real plants can also serve as a source of food. Turtles enjoy fresh, clean and clear water. A good filter can help accomplish this. Also, once every two weeks, about 25% of the water should be removed and replaced with new water, and the filter cleaned. It is also strongly recommended to keep fast freshwater fish if the tank is large enough and the water has the proper pH and temperature. In a large enough tank with areas for fish to hide, it is very unlikely they will be eaten. Meanwhile, the majority of freshwater fish will feed on the leftover turtle feed, which allows for a much cleaner environment for both the turtles and the fish. They do not fare well in confined quarters, especially when overcrowded with hatchlings. They have been known to be cannibalistic. Certain species of fresh-water fish are also useful in consuming mosquito larvae, which may appear in outdoor enclosures. [ In popular culture ] Within the second volume of the Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the popular comic book heroes are revealed as specimens of the red-eared slider. The popularity of the Turtles led to a craze for keeping them as pets in Great Britain.
