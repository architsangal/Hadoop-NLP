The name was misunderstood and became Grimstad during the registration of Norwegian cities and small places.The site of the town was originally the port ( Old Norse : stoð) of the old Grøm farm. The exact meaning of the name Grøm is uncertain, but it is derived from a river name Gró or Gróa which means &quot; the growing one &quot;. [ Coat-of-arms ] The coat-of-arms were granted in 1899 and were based upon a seal of the city dating back to 1847. The arms show a brig as a symbol for the importance of shipping to the city.
