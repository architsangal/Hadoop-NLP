Great ape personhood is a movement to create legal recognition of bonobo s, common chimpanzee s, gorilla s, and orangutan s (the non- human great ape s ) as bona fide person s. [ First steps ] On February 28, 2007 the parliament of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous province of Spain, passed the world&apos;s first legislation that would effectively grant legal personhood rights to all great apes.

On June 25, 2008 a parliamentary committee set forth resolutions urging Spain to grant the primates the rights to life and liberty. If approved &quot; it will ban harmful experiments on apes and make keeping them for circuses, television commercials, or filming illegal under Spain&apos;s penal code. &quot; [ http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSL256586320080625 Spanish parliament to extend rights to apes 2008-07-11 2008-06-25 Reuters ] These precedents followed years of European legal efforts. In 1992, Switzerland amended its constitution to recognize animals as beings and not things.

A decade later, Germany guaranteed rights to animals in a 2002 amendment to its constitution, becoming the first European Union member to do so.

A Movement to Grant Legal Protection to Animals is Gathering Force &quot;, E Magazine, March/April 2003. } Goodall&apos;s longitudinal studies revealed the social and family life of chimps to be very similar to that of human beings in some respects. She herself calls them individuals, and says they relate to her as an individual member of the clan. Laboratory studies of ape language ability began to reveal other human traits, as did genetics, and eventually three of the great apes were reclassified as hominids. This, plus rising ape extinction and the animal rights movement has put pressure on nations to recognize apes as having limited rights and being legal &quot; persons. &quot; In response, the United Kingdom introduced a ban on research using great apes, although testing on other primates has not been limited.

He points out that in the majority of the world, &quot; corporations are recognized as legal persons and are granted many of the same rights humans enjoy, the right to sue, to vote and to freedom of speech. &quot; Dawn Prince-Hughes has written that great apes meet all the standards set out for personhood: &quot; self-awareness; comprehension of past, present, and future; the ability to understand complex rules and their consequences on emotional levels; the ability to choose to risk those consequences, a capacity for empathy, and the ability to think abstractly. &quot; [ Songs of the Gorilla Nation Prince-Hughes Dawn Dawn Prince-Hughes 1987 Harmony 1-4000-5058-8 138 ] [ Criticism ] Gary Francione, while an animal rights advocate, criticizes the concept of granting personhood because the animal in question is human-like, and argues instead that sentience is the only characteristic a being requires to have basic rights.
