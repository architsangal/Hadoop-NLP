Its total seating capacity is 78,360 { Grand Sports Arena } seats, all covered. The stadium is a part of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex, previously called the Central Lenin Stadium ( [ Центральный стадион имени В. И. Ленина ] ). The name Luzhniki derives from the flood meadows in the bend of Moskva River where the stadium was built, translating roughly as &quot; The Meadows &quot;. The stadium is located in Khamovniki District of the Central Administrative Okrug of Moscow -city. As part of the Olympic complex Luzhniki also have the Palace of Sport at Luzhniki. [ Stadium history ] Inside view Its field is used mainly for football games by Torpedo Moscow club, who also own the sports complex, and Spartak Moscow. It is also one of the few major European stadia to use an artificial pitch, as it installed a FIFA-approved FieldTurf pitch in 2002. The pitch is necessary for the cold Russian climate, as regular grass pitches are often destroyed during a typical winter and must be replaced at high cost. However, a temporary natural grass pitch was installed for the 2008 Champions League Final. The Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium was the chief venue for the 1980 Summer Olympics, the spectator capacity being 103,000 at that time. The events hosted in this stadium were the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, Athletics, Football finals, and the Individual Jumping Grand Prix. { 1980 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. Part 1. pp. 48-51. } The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Cup Final in which Parma defeated Marseille in the second UEFA Cup to be played as a single fixture. The Luzhniki Stadium was chosen by UEFA to host the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final won by Manchester United who beat Chelsea in the first all English Champions League Final on May 21. Prior to the match some skeptics questioned the state of the pitch and also the ability of Russian authorities to keep order amongst the traveling British fans, however the match passed incident free and a British Embassy in Moscow spokesman said, &quot; The security and logistical arrangements put in place by the Russian authorities have been first-rate, as has been their cooperation with their visiting counterparts from the UK. &quot; [ http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3985272.ece Moscow proud of trouble-free Champions League final The Times 2008-05-22 2008-05-22 London Tony Halpin ] The 2018 FIFA World Cup has been awarded to Russia and the Luzhniki Stadium has been selected by the Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid as the venue for the final which will be held on July 8, 2018.

Her husband is Yuriy Luzhkov, the former mayor of Moscow, and many see the awarding of the contract to have been a conflict of interest. { Russian Roulette: Western Companies Fight for Press Freedom in Moscow - International - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News } [ References ] [ External links ] Official website Stadium picture [ et ] [ Stadio Comunale Turin Summer Universiade Opening and Closing Ceremonies 1973 Stadio Olimpico Roma ] [ UEFA Cup Final Venue Parc des Princes Paris Parken Stadium Copenhagen 1999 ] [ UEFA Champions League Final Venue Olympic Stadium Athens Stadio Olimpico Rome 2008 ] [ FIFA World Cup Final Venue Estádio do Maracanã Rio de Janeiro Lusail Iconic Stadium Lusail 2018 ] Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1956 Category:Sports venues built in the Soviet Union Category:Football venues in Russia Moscow Category:Outdoor ice hockey venues in Russia Category:IIHF World Championship venues Category:Sports venues in Moscow Category:FC Torpedo Moscow Category:FC Spartak Moscow Russia Category:1980 Summer Olympic venues Category:Olympic athletics venues Category:Olympic equestrian venues Category:Olympic football venues Category:2018 FIFA World Cup stadiums ar:ملعب لوزنيكي bg:Лужники (стадион) ca:Estadi Luzhniki cs:Lužniki da:Luzjniki Stadion de:Olympiastadion Luschniki et:Lužniki staadion el:Στάδιο Λουζνίκι es:Estadio Olímpico Luzhnikí fr:Stade Loujniki ga:Staid Luzhniki ko:루즈니키 스타디움 hr:Stadion Lužniki id:Stadion Luzhniki is:Luzhniki-leikvangur it:Stadio Lužniki he:אצטדיון לוז&apos;ניקי la:Stadium Lužniki lt:Lužnikų stadionas hu:Luzsnyiki Stadion mr:लुझनिकी मैदान nl:Olympisch Stadion Loezjniki ja:ルジニキ・スタジアム no:Luzjniki stadion pl:Stadion Łużniki pt:Estádio Lujniki ru:Лужники (стадион) simple:Luzhniki Stadium sr:Стадион Лужњики fi:Lužniki sv:Luzjnikistadion tr:Lujniki Stadyumu uk:Лужники (стадіон) zh:卢日尼基体育场
