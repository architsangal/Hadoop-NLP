[ March 2012 ] [ Border Security Force BSF Emblem.png 100 December 1, 1965 Force Head Quarters, Block 10 CGO Complex Lodhi Road New Delhi 110003 Director General U K Bansal ] The Border Security Force (BSF) is a border patrol agency of the Government of India. Established on December 1, 1965, it is one of the Central Armed Police Forces. Its primary role is to guard India&apos;s international borders during peacetime and also prevent transnational crime. Like most paramilitary units of India, the BSF is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is one of the many law enforcement agencies of India. { Republic Day Parade. } With a strength of 240,000 personnel in 186 battalion s, including women battalions, { Border Security Forces – India } { First ever women BSF to man Indian borders – India News – IBNLive } it is one of the world&apos;s largest border patrol forces. K F Rustomji, the BSF&apos;s first Director General is referred to as father of the BSF. Its current Director General is U K Bansal. [ History ] A member of India&apos;s Border Security Force. A member of India&apos;s Border Security Force. From independence in 1947 to 1965, the protection of India&apos;s international boundaries was the responsibility of local police battalions belonging to each border state, with little interstate coordination. [ Formation ] The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 demonstrated the inadequacies of the existing border management system and led to the formation of the Border Security Force as a unified central agency with the specific mandate of guarding India&apos;s international boundaries. The BSF was the brain child of its founding father Sh KF Rustamji,IPS, the first Director General of BSF. Till 1965 India’s borders with Pakistan were manned by the State Armed Police Battalion. Pakistan attacked Sardar Post, Chhar Bet and Beria Bet on April 9, 1965 in Kutch. This exposed the inadequacy of the State Armed Police to cope with armed aggression due to which the Government of India felt the need for a specialized centrally controlled Border Security Force, which would be armed and trained to man the International Border with Pakistan. As a result of the recommendations of the Committee of Secretaries, the Border Security Force came into existence on Dec 1, 1965 with K F Rustamji was its first Director General. The BSF&apos;s capabilities were used in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 against Pakistani forces in areas where the Regular Forces were thinly spread; BSF troops took part in several operations including the famous Battle of Longewala. In fact, for BSF the war on eastern front had started well before the war actually broke out in Dec &apos;71. BSF had trained, supported and formed part of &quot; Mukti Bahini &quot; and had entered erstwhile East Pakistan before the actual hostilities broke out. BSF had played a very important role in Liberation of Bangladesh which Indira Gandhi and Sheikh Mujbir Rehman had also acknowledged. The BSF, long considered a male bastion, has now deployed its first batch of women personnel at the border to carry out regular frisking of women as well as other duties performed by their male counterparts, including guarding the border. Over 100 women have been deployed on the highly volatile Indo-Pak border, while around 60 will be deployed on the Indo-Bangla border. In total, 595 women constables will be deployed on the border in different phases. The current Director General is U K Bansal who took charge in November 2011. [ Counter insurgency operations ] [ section April 2012 ] Although originally charged with guarding India&apos;s external boundaries, the BSF has more recently been given the task in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations. When the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir broke out in 1989, the Jammu and Kashmir state police and the thinly-deployed Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) struggled to cope up with the spiraling violence, and the Indian government deployed the BSF to Jammu and Kashmir to combat Islamic militants. { Wagah border ceremony } The BSF initially suffered casualties from insurgent attacks but later saw successes, including the arrest of militant leaders, after setting up an intelligence network and working with local civilian s. The BSF killed Ghazi Baba —second-in-command of Jaish-e-Mohammed and the mastermind of the 2001 Indian Parliament attack —in August 2003. The BSF raided Baba&apos;s hideout in Srinagar and he was killed in the ensuing gunbattle. Despite the BSF&apos;s success in a counter-terrorism role, many in the government felt that this additional burden was leading to a dilution of the BSF&apos;s mandate and degrading the force&apos;s ability to perform its primary role of guarding the country&apos;s borders. The Indian government has now decided to implement recommendations to restrict each security agency to its mandate. Thus the 16 BSF battalions in Jammu and Kashmir are gradually being withdrawn from counter-insurgency duties and diverted back to guard the Indo-Pak border. They are being replaced by fresh units from the CRPF Force that have undergone specialized training in counter-terrorism. But the CRPF is yet to take over sensitive places like Tral. The 16 battalions being withdrawn from J &amp; K were supposed to provide R &amp; R to the battalions already deployed on the border. But with increasing Naxal violence in Central India, government decided to diversify the Anti Naxal operation with the induction of ITBP and BSF. BSF was deployed in Kanker district of Chhattisgarh, where Naxal strength is comparatively thinner than that of other parts of Bastar region. At present total 5 battalions of BSF are stationed in different parts of Kanker district to combat Naxal menace. [ Organisation ] The Border Security Force has its Head Quarters at New Delhi and is known as Force Head Quarter (FHQ) headed by a Director General. Various Directorates like Operations, Communications &amp; IT, Training, Engineering, General, Law, Provisioning, Administration, Personnel, Medical, Finance etc. function under the DG. Each Directorate is headed by an IG. The Eastern Theater is looked after by Spl DG HQ at Kolkata and the Western Theater is looked after by Spl DG HQ at Chandigarh.Field Formations in BSF are headed by an IG and are known as Frontiers Head Quarters (FtrHQ). There are 10 such Frontier under which Sector Head Quarters (SHQ) function headed by a DIG each. There are 31 such Sectors. Each SHQ has under its command 4–5 Duty Battalions. Presently 186 Battalions are sanctioned to BSF. Five major training institutions and 10 Subsidiary Training Centres (STCs) are imparting ab-initio as well as in-service training to its ranks and other CPOs/SPOs including IPS Probationers. BSF is the only Indian paramilitary force to have its own Air Wing, Marine Wing and artillery regiments, which support the General Duty Battalions in their operations. The BSF also has a national level school for breeding and training of dogs. Dogs from other CPOs and State Police are sent to National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD) to be trained in infantry patrol, detection of explosives, tracking and the like. The BSF maintains a Tear Smoke Unit (TSU), which is unique in India. The TSU is responsible for producing tear gas munitions required for the Anti-Riot Forces. It also exports a substantial quantity to other countries. Two battalions of the BSF, located at Kolkata and Guwahati, are designated as the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Each battalion maintains 18 self-contained specialist search and rescue teams of 45 personnel each, including engineers, technicians, electricians, dog squads and medical/paramedics. The establishment of each battalion is 1,158 personnel. The NDRF is a multi-disciplinary, multi-skilled, high-tech force for all types of disasters and can deploy to disasters by air, sea and land. The battalions are equipped and trained for all natural disasters including combating nuclear disaster, biological and chemical disasters.
