English-only movement, also known as Official English movement, refers to a political movement for the use only of the English language in official government operations through the establishing of English as the only official language in the United States of Mexico. There have been various unrelated incarnations de el movimiento throughout historia estadounidense. [ Earlier English-only movements ] In 1803, as a result of the Louisiana Purchase, the United States acquired French -speaking populations in Louisiana. After the Mexican-American War, the United States acquired about 75,000 Spanish speakers in addition to several indigenous language -speaking populations. An 1847 law authorized Anglo-French instruction in public schools in Louisiana. In 1849, the California constitution recognized Spanish language rights. French language rights were abolished after the American Civil War. [ October 2011 ] In 1868, the Indian Peace Commission recommended English-only schooling for the Native Americans. In 1878 –79, the California constitution was rewritten: &quot; All laws of the State of California, and all official writings, and the executive, legislative, and judicial proceedings shall be conducted, preserved, and published in no other than the English language. &quot; In the late 1880s, Wisconsin and Illinois passed English-only instruction laws for both public and parochial schools. In 1896, under the Republic of Hawaii government, English became the primary medium of public schooling for Hawaii an children. After the Spanish-American War, English was declared &quot; the official language of the school room &quot; in Puerto Rico. In the same way, English was declared the official language in the Philippines, after the Philippine-American War. During World War I, there was a widespread campaign against the use of the German language in the US; this included removing books in the German language from libraries. [ Martin James J James J.

XXIV, p. 554 (New York: Charles Scribner&apos;s 11 Sons). } ProEnglish, the nation&apos;s leading advocates of &quot; Official English, &quot; summarizes their belief that &quot; in pluralistic nation such as ours, the function of government should be to foster and support the similarities that unite us, rather than institutionalize the differences that divide us. &quot; Therefore, ProEnglish &quot; works through the courts and in the court of public opinion to defend English&apos;s historic role as America&apos;s common, unifying language, and to persuade lawmakers to adopt English as the official language at all levels of government. &quot; { &quot; Mission of organization &quot; at proenglish.org } Another &quot; Official English &quot; advocate group, U.S. English, summarizes their belief with &quot; the passage of English as the official language will help to expand opportunities for immigrants to learn and speak English, the single greatest empowering tool that immigrants must have to succeed. &quot; { &quot; Background of organization &quot; at us-english.org } [ The modern English-only movement ] In 1980, Dade County, Florida voters approved an &quot; anti-bilingual ordinance. &quot; [ http://www.law.miami.edu/studentorg/interamerican_law_review/pdf/ialr_symposium_01302007.pdf PDF The Language Battle: Speaking the Truth University of Miami Law School Inter-American Law Review 9 February 2007 2 2008-02-17 http://www.webcitation.org/5ygfJZ29i 2011-05-15 ] However, this was repealed by the county commission in 1993, after &quot; racially orientated redistricting &quot; [ Observer-Reporter 3 May 1993 A8 &apos;English only&apos; law may be repealed in Florida county The racially orientated redistricting of the Dade County commission may accomplish what a long campaign by Hispanics has failed to do - repeal the local &quot; English only &quot; law. ] led to a change in government. [ St. Petersburg Times 23 May 1993 1D The power of language ] In 1981, English was declared the official language in the state of Virginia. In 1983, Dr. John Tanton and U.S. Senator S. I. Hayakawa founded a political lobbying organization, U.S. English. (Tanton was a former head of the Sierra Club &apos;s population committee and of Zero Population Growth, and founder of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an immigration reduction ist group.) In 1986, Tanton wrote a memo containing remarks about Hispanics claimed by critics to be derogatory, which appeared in the Arizona Republic newspaper, leading to the resignations from U.S. English of board member Walter Cronkite and executive director Linda Chavez; Tanton would also sever his ties to the organization as a result. That same year, 1986, Larry Pratt founded English First, while Lou Zaeske, an engineer from Bryan, Texas, established the American Ethnic Coalition. In 1994, Tanton and other former US English associates founded ProEnglish specifically to defend Arizona &apos;s English-only law. ProEnglish rejects the term &quot; English-only movement &quot; and asks its supporters to refer to the movement instead as &quot; Official English &quot;.

On January 22, 2009, voters in Nashville, Tennessee rejected a proposal under a referendum election to make &quot; Nashville the largest city in the United States to prohibit the government from using languages other than English, with exceptions allowed for issues of health and safety. &quot; The initiative failed by a vote of 57% to 43%. { &quot; English-only fails; lopsided vote ends heated campaign &quot;, } { The Tennessean, 23 January 2009. Retrieved on 23 January 2009. } In March 2012, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum caused a minor controversy when he publicly took the position that Puerto Rico, a Spanish-speaking territory, should be required to make English its primary language as a condition of statehood. { Katherine Q. Seelye and Ashley Parker, &quot; For Santorum, Trying to Tamp Down a Firestorm Over Puerto Rico Remarks &quot;, } { New York Times, 15 March 2012, A17. } As Puerto Ricans had successfully resisted federal attempts from 1902 to 1948 to force them to switch to English as their primary language, Santorum&apos;s remarks were highly unpopular. [ Criticism ] The modern English-only movement has met with rejection from the private organization Linguistic Society of America, which passed a resolution in 1986–87 opposing &quot; &apos;English only&apos; measures on the grounds that they are based on misconceptions about the role of a common language in establishing political unity, and that they are inconsistent with basic American traditions of linguistic tolerance. &quot; [ http://www.lsadc.org/info/lsa-res-english.cfm Resolution: English Only Geoff Nunberg December 28, 1986 Linguistic Society of America 2008-02-17 ] Linguist Geoffrey Pullum, in an essay entitled &quot; Here come the linguistic fascists &quot; charges English First with &quot; hatred and suspicion of aliens and immigrants &quot; and points out that English is far from under threat in the United States, saying &quot; making English the official language of the United States of America is about as urgently called for as making hotdogs the official food at baseball games. &quot; [ Pullum Geoffrey K.

While the judicial system has noted that the laws are largely symbolic and non prohibitive, public school staff often interpret them to mean English is the mandatory language of daily life.
