[ the Fenian Thomas Maguire who was convicted in 1867 with the Manchester Martyrs Manchester Martyrs ] Tom Maguire Tom Maguire (28 March 1892 – 5 July 1993) was an Irish republican who held the rank of commandant-general in the Western Command of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and led the South Mayo flying column. [ Mansergh Martin The legacy of history: for making peace in Ireland : lectures and commemorative addresses Mercier Press 2003 304 1-85635-389-3 ] [ Irish Republican Army ] In May 1921, he led an ambush on a Royal Irish Constabulary patrol in Tourmakeady, County Mayo, killing four. Maguire&apos;s flying column then made for the Partry Mountains. The long held account of the following action claimed that the column were surrounded by over 700 crown forces guided by aeroplanes. Maguire was wounded and his adjutant killed, but the column managed to escape with no further casualties. British casualties were not revealed but were long believed to have been high. Some recent research has raised the possibility that fewer than forty British soldiers were in the vicinity and that Maguire&apos;s column was forced to abandon their weapons with only one British officer wounded. { Donal Buckley, The Battle of Tourmakeady, 2008 } However, the objectivity of this research is highly questionable. [ November 2011 ] Maguire was involved in numerous other engagements including the Kilfall ambush. [ Memories of the men of the west James Laffey http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j%3D35163 Western People 27 February 2007 27 February 2007 ] At the 1921 election to Dáil Éireann, Maguire was returned unopposed as Teachta Dála (TD) for Mayo South–Roscommon South as a Sinn Féin candidate. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and apart from saying &quot; Níl &quot; ( &quot; No &quot; in English ) when the vote was called, did not participate in any substantial way in the Dáil treaty debates. He was returned unopposed at the 1922 general election.

[ Parliamentary election results in Ireland, 1918-92 Walker, Brian M Royal Irish Academy Dublin 1992 0-901714-96-8 0332-0286 114 ] [ http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID%3D1145 Thomas Maguire ElectionsIreland.org 24 March 2012 ] He was a member of the anti-Treaty IRA executive which commanded rebel troops during the Irish Civil War. Maguire was captured by the Free State Army and was told that he would be executed, but his life was spared, possibly because of his prominence as a Republican. While in prison his brother, Sean Maguire, aged 17, was executed by the Free State. { &quot; They remained faithful &quot;. 1985. An Phoblacht/Republican News, April 25, 1985, pp. 8-9. } Maguire remained a TD until 1927. He had initially indicated a willingness to contest the June 1927 general election as a Sinn Féin candidate but withdrew after the Irish Republican Army threatened to court-martial any member under IRA General Army Order 28, which forbade its members from standing in elections. (Despite this ban, IRA officers Seán Farrell ( Leitrim–Sligo ) and John Madden ( Mayo North ) contested the election, the latter successfully). Maguire subsequently drifted out of the IRA. In 1932, a Mayo IRA officer reported that Maguire, now firmly aligned with Sinn Féin, refused to call on men to join the IRA when speaking at republican commemorations. When challenged on this, Maguire claimed that, as the IRA “were no longer the same as they used to be”, he disagreed with the organisation. [ Maguire and republican legitimacy ] [ Irish republican legitimatism ] In December 1938, Maguire was one of a group of seven people, who had been elected to the Second Dáil in 1921, who met with the IRA Army Council under Seán Russell. At this meeting, the seven signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of Dáil Éireann to the Army Council. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic and, on this basis, the IRA and Sinn Féin justified their rejection of the states of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and political abstentionism from their parliamentary institutions. According to J. Bowyer Bell, in the Secret Army, &quot; With the possible exception of Tom Maguire, who went along, the Dáil members felt that the IRA request gave them the moral recognition so long denied by all factions and that their conditional devolution of power would in turn give the IRA the moral basis for the impending campaign &quot; of 1939–45. { J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, 1997, p. 154. } When the majority of IRA and Sinn Féin decided to abandon abstentionism in the 1969–70 split, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill sought and secured Maguire&apos;s recognition of the Provisional IRA as the legitimate successor to the 1938 Army Council. Of the seven 1938 signatories, Maguire was the only one still alive. { Other former members of the Second Dáil were still alive in 1969, but were disregarded by legitimists because they did not support the Irish Republic before 1938. } Likewise in the aftermath of the 1986 split in the Republican Movement, Maguire signed a statement in 1986 but was issued posthumously in 1996, he conferred this &quot; legitimacy &quot; on the Army Council of the Continuity IRA (who provided a firing party at Maguire&apos;s funeral in 1993). In The Irish Troubles, J. Bowyer Bell describes Maguire&apos;s opinion in 1986, &quot; abstentionism was a basic tenet of republicanism, a moral issue of principle. Abstentionism gave the movement legitimacy, the right to wage war, to speak for a Republic all but established in the hearts of the people. &quot; { J. Bowyer Bell, The Irish Troubles, 1993, ISBN 0-312-08827-2, page 731. } Although the 1938 conferring has been crucial to the ideology of republican legitimatists, for all intents and purposes its validity was rejected by the overwhelming majority of the Irish people. In 1986 &quot; a delegation from the [Gerry] Adams leadership &quot; asked for his support, but Maguire rejected them. { Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, 2006, p. 310. } Republican Sinn Féin is the only party in Ireland which subscribes to the view that the seven-member Army Council of the Continuity IRA is the legitimate governmental authority of the Irish Republic. Maguire was the last survivor, not only of the rump legitimist Second Dáil of 1938, but of all those who served in the Second Dáil in 1921–22. [ April 2011 ] The last IRA veteran of the Irish War of Independence, Dan Keating, who died in 2007, also supported Republican Sinn Féin.
