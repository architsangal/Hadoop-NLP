He also was a coach in the Major Leagues under John McGraw for the New York Giants, owned and managed the minor league Worcester club, and coached at Holy Cross College. [ December 2011 ] Burkett began his pro career as a pitcher, won 27 games at the age of 19 in 1888 in Scranton, Pa., and also compiled a 39–6 record for the Worcester Club of the New England League. He played in the Major Leagues from 1890 to 1905, primarily as an outfielder, and had an accomplished hitting career, smacking 200 hits in a season six times and batting over.400 twice (1895 and 1896), only the second hitter in Major League history to do so, the first being Ed Delahanty. On his Hall of Fame plaque, Burkett is credited for hitting over.400 three times; subsequent research and updated records have lowered his 1899 batting average to.396. In 1895 and 1896, Burkett&apos;s two best seasons, the Cleveland Spiders finished second twice and faced off against the Baltimore Orioles both seasons in the Temple Cup series, beating the Orioles in the 1895 series with Cy Young pitching three victories. Also, in game one of the series, Burkett scored the game winning run in the bottom of the ninth to set the tone for the series.

Burkett holds the record for the most inside-the-park home runs in Major League Baseball, with 55 [ Career Inside The Park Home Run Records http://www.baseball-almanac/recbooks/rb_isphr.shtml baseball-almanac.com 4 April 2012 ].
