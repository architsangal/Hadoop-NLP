[ 2003 7 2 ] { 85 minutes } { United States } { English } { $60 million } { $80,767,884 } Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas is a 2003 American animated swashbuckling fantasy aventure film produced by DreamWorks Animation, using traditional 2D animation with some 3D. This is the last DreamWorks animated film to use traditional animation, due to DreamWorks&apos; decision that the American public appeared to be more interested in computer animation. It covers the story of Sinbad (voiced by Brad Pitt ), a pirate who travels the sea to recover the lost Book of Peace from Eris (voiced by Michelle Pfeiffer ) in order to save his childhood friend, Prince Proteus (voiced by Joseph Fiennes ), from accepting Sinbad&apos;s death sentence. [ Plot ] Sinbad attempts to steal the magical, mystical &quot; Book of Peace &quot; while it travels to Syracuse, Sicily, protected by Proteus; but is prevented when Cetus attacks the ship. Drawn underwater by Cetus, Sinbad is saved by Eris, who offers him any boon he desires in exchange for the Book of Peace. Sinbad and his crew go to Syracuse to steal the Book; but leave without doing so. Anticipating this, Eris impersonates Sinbad and steals the Book. Sinbad is sentenced to be executed; whereupon Proteus sends Sinbad to retrieve the book instead, placing himself as hostage, and Proteus&apos;s fiancée Marina (voiced by Catherine Zeta-Jones ) goes to make sure that Sinbad succeeds. To prevent them, Eris sends a group of siren s, who entrance and seduce the men aboard Sinbad&apos;s ship with their enchantingly seductive, soft melodic singing voices, but do not affect Marina, who pilots the ship to safety; and later a Roc, who captures Marina, but is later killed by Sinbad. After these and other incidents, Marina and Sinbad enter Eris&apos;s realm, where she reveals that her plan was to maneuver Proteus into Sinbad&apos;s place, leaving Syracuse without an heir, and agrees to surrender the Book of Peace only if Sinbad truthfully tells whether he will return to Syracuse to accept blame. When he answers that he will, Eris calls him a liar, and returns him and Marina to the mortal world. In Syracuse, the time allotted to Sinbad has elapsed, and Proteus is to be beheaded; but at the last minute, Sinbad appears to replace him. Angered by this, Eris saves him by shattering the executioner&apos;s sword to pieces, and quarrels with him for his honesty, but as part of the deal with Sinbad, she reluctantly gives the Book to him before disappearing. With the Book restored to Syracuse, Sinbad and his crew leave Syracuse on another voyage, leaving Marina behind. Proteus, seeing that Marina has fallen in love with Sinbad, releases her from their engagement and sends her to join Sinbad&apos;s ship.

There is no way that Syracuse could exist outside animation, and as we watch it, we are sailing over the edge of the human imagination &quot; [ http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F20030702%2FREVIEWS%2F307020302%2F1023 Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas Review Chicago Sun-Times ]. That the film removed the story from its Arab ic context and places it in a Greek setting earned it some criticism. Jack Shaheen, a critic of Hollywood&apos;s portrayal of Arabs, believes that &quot; the studio feared financial and possibly political hardships if they made the film&apos;s hero Arab &quot;, and claimed that &quot; If no attempt is made to challenge negative stereotypes about Arabs, the misperceptions continue. It&apos;s regrettable that the opportunity wasn&apos;t taken to change them, especially in the minds of young people &quot;. At one point, Shaheen asked Katzenberg to include some references to Arabic culture in the film.
