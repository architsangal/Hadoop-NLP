[ The Daily Wrap-up, Round 4: The Tour Championship http://www.pgatour.com/2010/tournaments/r060/09/26/rd4-wrap/ 2010-09-27 pgatour.com September 26, 2010 ] He has won one major championship, the 2003 U.S. Open. Furyk is known for consistently playing at the top level and for a visibly unconventional, looping golf swing. Due to his ability to perform at such a high level despite that swing and his deliberate approach to the game, his devoted fan base has given him the nicknames &quot; The Grinder &quot; and &quot; The Businessman &quot;. In September 2006 he reached a career high of second in the Official World Golf Rankings. { Jim Furyk Wins the Canadian Open and is the New World Number Two, Official World Golf Ranking site, September 11, 2006. } He ranked in the top-10 for over 350 weeks between 1999 and 2010. { 69 Players Who Have Reached The Top-10 In World Ranking } [ European Tour Official Guide 09 PDF 2009-01-16 38th 2009 PGA European Tour Players who have reached the Top Ten in the Official World Golf Ranking since 1986 558 ] [ Biography ] Furyk was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania. At that time, his father Mike was an assistant pro at Edgmont Country Club and later also spent time as a pro at West Chester Golf and Country Club as well as Hidden Springs Golf Course in Horsham. His early years were spent in the Pittsburgh suburbs learning the game from his father, who was head pro at Uniontown Country Club near Pittsburgh. He graduated from Manheim Township High School in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in 1988 where he was a standout basketball player in addition to being a state champion golfer. He attended the University of Arizona and turned professional in 1992. Furyk at the 2004 Ryder Cup Furyk won at least one tournament each year on the PGA Tour between 1998 and 2003. At the time, this was the second best streak of winning seasons behind Tiger Woods and he made the top ten in the Official World Golf Rankings. Furyk&apos;s biggest win to date came on June 16, 2003, when he tied the record for the lowest 72-hole score in U.S. Open history to win his first major championship. In 2004 he only played in fourteen events after missing three months due to surgery to repair cartilage damage in his wrist and he fell out of the top hundred on the money list, but he returned to good form in 2005 and regained his top ten ranking, winning a PGA Tour event in that year and two in 2006. In the 2006 season, he finished a career-high second on the money list and won the Vardon Trophy for the first time. He also had a career-best thirteen top-10 finishes, including nine top-3s, four second-place finishes, and two victories. The only instructor he has ever used is his dad, Mike Furyk, which may account for his unusual swing. His caddy is Mike &quot; Fluff &quot; Cowan, who was Tiger Woods &apos; caddy for Woods&apos; first two years as a professional. 2010 was a banner year for Furyk. After going more than two seasons winless, he won a career-best three tournaments on Tour in 2010: The Transitions Championship, the Verizon Heritage, and the season-ending Tour Championship. Furyk&apos;s victory in the Tour Championship also earned him the 2010 FedEx Cup after winning by one stroke.

This moves his 6&apos;2 &quot; frame in so close that his hands are virtually touching his thighs. Most golfers would have a difficult time with a golf club from such a starting point. Compare Furyk&apos;s setup to the more textbook setup of Tiger Woods, who begins with his hands 8  inches or so away from his body, a position that promotes a take-away that will put the golf club over his right shoulder at the top, and keep his right elbow tucked against his body. For a human being, this is the classic launch position. Since the beginning of time it has been used to throw a stone, a spear, a baseball, or swing a club. The big muscles of the body—the back, shoulders and thighs—are in control, not the weaker ones in the hands and wrists. The athlete (or hunter in early times) is said to be &quot; loaded. &quot; His entire body is poised in the optimum power position. Furyk, by contrast, takes the club away in the manner of a basketball player shooting a hook shot. His arms move back vertically, and at the top his right elbow &quot; flies &quot; away from his body. Tall players tend toward more upright swings. While this manner of beginning doesn&apos;t promote power, it is an early step to facilitate accurate ball-striking. The club&apos;s shaft is nearly vertical, like a putter. It moves straight back and straight up, keeping it on path longer, which tends to reinforce in the mind the route along which to bring it back into the ball. At the top of the backswing, Furyk is in the same position as Jack Nicklaus would be—club shaft parallel to the intended line of flight, elbow flying off to who-knows-where. Starting the downswing, Furyk then &quot; corrects &quot; for his unconventional takeaway by dropping his right elbow into the slot where it needs to be, a move that brings the golf club onto the proper swing path to achieve sound results. It&apos;s this downswing beginning that produces the idiosyncratic loop in his swing. As Mike Furyk describes in a Golf Digest issue in 2001, Jim Furyk&apos;s hips &quot; underturn &quot; during the backswing and &quot; overturn &quot; coming down. On the downswing, he draws the club in a large arc behind his body (viewing from his right hand side), then pastes his elbow against his right hip at impact. Commentator, Gary McCord, said it looked like Furyk was trying to swing inside a phone booth. Another commentator David Feherty memorably described Furyk&apos;s swing as &quot; an octopus falling out of a tree &quot;. Others have noted it reminds them of &quot; a one-armed golfer using an axe to kill a snake in a telephone booth. &quot; { Patience is pivotal for inconsistent Furyk, The Scotsman, July 18, 2007 } This move was controversial during Jim Furyk&apos;s early career; however, his father never forced him to change what came naturally to him. Jim Furyk&apos;s well-known ball-striking precision is now serving him well on the professional tour. Furyk, however, isn&apos;t the first professional golfer to show us that a swing that defies convention—and countless books and articles on golf—can be successful. Nicklaus&apos; swing was upright, with a flying elbow—and one of the biggest loopers of all time was Lee Trevino.
