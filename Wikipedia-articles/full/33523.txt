A leader of the Progressive Movement, he served as President of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910, and then as the Governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913. Running against Progressive ( &quot; Bull Moose &quot; ) Party candidate Theodore Roosevelt and Republican candidate William Howard Taft, Wilson was elected President as a Democrat in 1912. In his first term as President, Wilson persuaded a Democratic Congress to pass major progressive reforms. Historian John M. Cooper argues that, in his first term, Wilson successfully pushed a legislative agenda that few presidents have equaled, and remained unmatched up until the New Deal. { Cooper, John Milton. &quot; Woodrow Wilson: A Biography &quot;. p201 } This agenda included the Federal Reserve Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, the Federal Farm Loan Act and an income tax. Child labor was curtailed by the Keating–Owen Act of 1916, but the U.S. Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1918. He also had Congress pass the Adamson Act, which imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads. [ K. Austin Kerr Decision For Federal Control: Wilson, McAdoo, and the Railroads, 1917 2937406 Journal of American History 54 3 1967 550–560 10.2307/2937406 ] Wilson, after first sidestepping the issue, became a major advocate for the women&apos;s suffrage. Narrowly re-elected in 1916, he had full control of American entry into World War I, and his second term centered on World War I and the subsequent peace treaty negotiations in Paris. He based his re-election campaign around the slogan, &quot; He kept us out of war &quot;, but U.S. neutrality was challenged in early 1917 when the German government began unrestricted submarine warfare despite repeated strong warnings, and tried to enlist Mexico as an ally. In April 1917, Wilson asked Congress to declare war. During the war, Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations, leaving the waging of the war itself primarily in the hands of the Army. On the home front in 1917, he began the United States&apos; first draft since the American Civil War, raised billions of dollars in war funding through Liberty Bonds, set up the War Industries Board, promoted labor union cooperation, supervised agriculture and food production through the Lever Act, took over control of the railroads, and suppressed anti-war movements. During his term in office, Wilson gave a well-known Flag Day speech that fueled the wave of anti-German sentiment sweeping the country in 1917–18. { Frederick C. Luebke, Bonds of Loyalty: German Americans and World War I (DeKalb, Ill.: Northern Illinois University Press, 1974), 234–235. } In the late stages of the war, Wilson took personal control of negotiations with Germany, including the armistice. In 1918, he issued his Fourteen Points, his view of a post-war world that could avoid another terrible conflict. In 1919, he went to Paris to create the League of Nations and shape the Treaty of Versailles, with special attention on creating new nations out of defunct empires. In 1919, Wilson engaged in an intense fight with Henry Cabot Lodge and the Republican-controlled Senate over giving the League of Nations power to force the U.S. into a war. Wilson collapsed with a debilitating stroke that left his wife in control until he left office in March 1921. The Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles, the U.S. never joined the League, and the Republicans won a landslide in 1920 by denouncing Wilson&apos;s policies. An intellectual with very high writing standards, he was also a highly effective partisan campaigner as well as legislative strategist. A Presbyterian of deep religious faith, Wilson appealed to a gospel of service and infused a profound sense of moralism into his idealistic internationalism, now referred to as &quot; Wilsonian &quot;. Wilsonianism calls for the United States to enter the world arena to fight for democracy, and has been a contentious position in American foreign policy. { John Morton Blum, Woodrow Wilson and the Politics of Morality (1956); Richard M.

Truman. [ Early life ] Wilson was born in Staunton, Virginia on December 28, 1856 as the third of four children of Reverend Dr. Joseph Ruggles Wilson (1822–1903) and Jessie Janet Woodrow (1826–1888). { John Milton Cooper, Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (2009) pp 13–19 } His ancestry was Scottish and Scots-Irish. His paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland (now Northern Ireland ), in 1807. His mother was born in Carlisle, Cumberland, England, the daughter of Rev. Dr. Thomas Woodrow, born in Paisley, Scotland and Marion Williamson from Glasgow.

[ Walworth 1958 ] { p. 4 } Wilson&apos;s parents moved south in 1851 and identified with the Confederacy. His father defended slavery, owned slaves and set up a Sunday school for them. They cared for wounded soldiers at their church. The father also briefly served as a chaplain to the Confederate Army. [ http://www.presidentialavenue.com/ww.cfm Woodrow Wilson – 28th President, 1913–1921 PresidentialAvenue.com ] Woodrow Wilson&apos;s earliest memory, from the age of three, was of hearing that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming. Wilson would forever recall standing for a moment at Robert E. Lee &apos;s side and looking up into his face. Wilson&apos;s father was one of the founders of the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) after it split from the northern Presbyterians in 1861. Joseph R. Wilson served as the first permanent clerk of the southern church&apos;s General Assembly, was Stated Clerk from 1865–1898 and was Moderator of the PCUS General Assembly in 1879. Wilson spent the majority of his childhood, up to age 14, in Augusta, Georgia, where his father was minister of the First Presbyterian Church.

He studied at home under his father&apos;s guidance and took classes in a small school in Augusta. { Link Road to the White House pp. 3–4. } During Reconstruction, Wilson lived in Columbia, South Carolina, the state capital, from 1870–1874, where his father was professor at the Columbia Theological Seminary. { Walworth ch 1 } Wilson attended Davidson College in North Carolina for the 1873–1874 school year. [ Woodrow Wilson http://sites.davidson.edu/archives/encyclopedia/woodrow-wilson/ Davidson College November 9, 2011 ] After medical ailments kept him from returning for a second year, he transferred to Princeton as a freshman when his father took a teaching position at the university. Graduating in 1879, Wilson became a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Beginning in his second year, he read widely in political philosophy and history. Wilson credited the British parliamentary sketch-writer Henry Lucy as his inspiration to enter public life. He was active in the undergraduate American Whig-Cliosophic Society literary and debating society, serving as speaker of the Whig Party and writing for the Nassau Literary Review, { http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d &amp; d=Princetonian19670615-01.2.81 &amp; srpos=2 &amp; e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-ellsworth+%22debate%22----# } organized a separate Liberal Debating Society, { Link, Wilson I:5–6; Wilson Papers I: 130, 245, 314 }, and later coached the Whig-Clio Debate Panel. { http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00335633009360910 } { http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d &amp; d=Princetonian18951205-01.2.5 &amp; srpos=17 &amp; e=-------en-20--1-byDA-txt-IN----- } In 1879, Wilson attended law school at the University of Virginia for one year. Although he never graduated, during his time at the university he was heavily involved in the Virginia Glee Club and the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society, serving as the society&apos;s president. [ The World&apos;s Work: A History of our Time, Volume IV: November 1911 – April 1912 Doubleday 1912 74–75 ] His frail health dictated withdrawal, and he went home to Wilmington, North Carolina where he continued his studies. [ Cranston 1945 ] In January 1882, Wilson started a law practice in Atlanta. One of his University of Virginia classmates, Edward Ireland Renick, invited him to join his new law practice as partner and Wilson joined him in May 1882. He passed the Georgia Bar. On October 19, 1882, he appeared in court before Judge George Hillyer to take his examination for the bar, which he passed easily. Competition was fierce in the city with 143 other lawyers, and he found few cases to keep him occupied. [ Mulder, John H. Woodrow Wilson: The Years of Preparation Princeton 1978 71–72 ] Nevertheless, he found staying current with the law obstructed his plans to study government to achieve his long-term plans for a political career. In April 1883, Wilson applied to the Johns Hopkins University to study for a doctorate in history and political science and began his studies there in the fall. [ Personal life ] Wilson&apos;s mother was possibly a hypochondriac and Wilson himself seemed to think that he was often in poorer health than he really was. He suffered from hypertension at a relatively early age and may have suffered his first stroke when he was 39.

They had three daughters: Margaret Woodrow Wilson (1886–1944); Jessie Wilson (1887–1933); and Eleanor R. Wilson (1889–1967). { Cooper (2009) pp. 57–62 } Axson died in 1914, and in 1915 Wilson married Edith Galt. { Cooper (2009) p 281 } Wilson is one of only three presidents to be widowed while in office.

Wilson was an early automobile enthusiast, and he took daily rides while he was President. His favorite car was a 1919 Pierce-Arrow, in which he preferred to ride with the top down. { &quot; The Pierce Arrow Limousine &quot;, Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library } His enjoyment of motoring made him an advocate of funding for public highways. { Weingroff, Richard F., &quot; President Woodrow Wilson – Motorist Extraordinaire &quot;, Federal Highway Administration } Wilson was an avid baseball fan. In 1915, he became the first sitting president to attend a World Series game. Wilson had been a center fielder during his Davidson College days. When he transferred to Princeton he was unable to make the varsity team and so became the team&apos;s assistant manager. He was the first President to throw out a first ball at a World Series game. { &quot; By the Numbers &quot; – 1915, } { CNNSI, October 17, 2002.

During the winter, the Secret Service would paint golf balls with black paint so Wilson could hit them around in the snow on the White House lawn. { Weinstein, Edwin A. (1981), Woodrow Wilson: A Medical and Psychological Biography, Princeton } [ Academic career ] He began his graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in 1883 and three years later he completed his doctoral dissertation, &quot; Congressional Government: A Study in American Politics &quot; { Internet Archive: &quot; Congressional government : a study in American politics (1885) &quot;, accessed January 6, 2011 } and received a PhD in history and political science.

However, he was tapped into the Irving Literary Society by the brothers of his fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi. He received academic appointments at Bryn Mawr College (1885–88) and Wesleyan University (1888–90).

Woodrow Wilson debate team. He then joined the Princeton faculty as professor of jurisprudence and political economy in 1890. While there, he was one of the faculty members of the short-lived coordinate college, Evelyn College for Women. Additionally, Wilson became the first lecturer of Constitutional Law at New York Law School where he taught with Charles Evans Hughes. { Walworth, v. 1; Link (1947) } Representing the American Whig Society, Wilson delivered an oration at Princeton&apos;s sesquicentennial celebration (1896) entitled &quot; Princeton in the Nation&apos;s Service &quot;.

Link (1947) } [ Writings on government and politics ] [ Government systems ] Under the influence of Walter Bagehot &apos;s The English Constitution, Wilson saw the United States Constitution as pre-modern, cumbersome, and open to corruption. An admirer of Parliament, Wilson favored a parliamentary system for the United States. Writing in the early 1880s: { The Politics of Woodrow Wilson, 41–48 } [ I ask you to put this question to yourselves, should we not draw the Executive and Legislature closer together? Should we not, on the one hand, give the individual leaders of opinion in Congress a better chance to have an intimate party in determining who should be president, and the president, on the other hand, a better chance to approve himself a statesman, and his advisers capable men of affairs, in the guidance of Congress ] Wilson started Congressional Government, his best-known political work, as an argument for a parliamentary system, but he was impressed by Grover Cleveland, and Congressional Government emerged as a critical description of America&apos;s system, with frequent negative comparisons to Westminster. He said, &quot; I am pointing out facts—diagnosing, not prescribing remedies. &quot; { Wilson Congressional Government 1885, p. 205. } Wilson believed that America&apos;s intricate system of checks and balances was the cause of the problems in American governance. He said that the divided power made it impossible for voters to see who was accountable. If government behaved badly, Wilson asked: { Wilson Congressional Government 1885, pp. 186–187. } [ How is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the whipping?... Power and strict accountability for its use are the essential constituents of good government... It is, therefore, manifestly a radical defect in our federal system that it parcels out power and confuses responsibility as it does. The main purpose of the Convention of 1787 seems to have been to accomplish this grievous mistake. The &quot; literary theory &quot; of checks and balances is simply a consistent account of what our Constitution makers tried to do; and those checks and balances have proved mischievous just to the extent which they have succeeded in establishing themselves. ] Wilson singled out the United States House of Representatives for particular criticism: { Wilson Congressional Government 1885, p. 76. } [... divided up, as it were, into forty-seven seignories, in each of which a Standing Committee is the court-baron and its chairman lord-proprietor. These petty barons, some of them not a little powerful, but none of them within reach [of] the full powers of rule, may at will exercise an almost despotic sway within their own shires, and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself. ] Wilson said that the Congressional committee system was fundamentally undemocratic in that committee chairs, who ruled by seniority, determined national policy although they were responsible to no one except their constituents; and that it facilitated corruption. { Wilson Congressional Government 1885, p. 132. } [ Evolving views ] By the time Wilson finished Congressional Government, Grover Cleveland was President, and Wilson&apos;s faith in the United States government was restored. When William Jennings Bryan captured the Democratic nomination from Cleveland&apos;s supporters in 1896, however, Wilson refused to support the ticket. Instead, he cast his ballot for John M. Palmer, the presidential candidate of the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, a short-lived party that supported a gold standard, low tariffs, and limited government. { David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, &quot; Gold Democrats and the Decline of Classical Liberalism, 1896–1900 &quot;, Independent Review 4 (Spring 2000), 555–75. } After experiencing the vigorous presidencies of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, Wilson no longer entertained thoughts of parliamentary government for the United States. In his last scholarly work in 1908, Constitutional Government of the United States, Wilson said that the presidency &quot; will be as big as and as influential as the man who occupies it &quot;. By the time of his presidency, Wilson merely hoped that Presidents could be party leaders in the same way British prime ministers were. Wilson also hoped that the parties could be reorganized along ideological, not geographic, lines. He wrote, &quot; Eight words contain the sum of the present degradation of our political parties: No leaders, no principles; no principles, no parties. &quot; { Frozen Republic, 145 } [ Public administration ] Wilson also studied public administration, which he called &quot; government in action; it is the executive, the operative, the most visible side of government, and is of course as old as government itself &quot;. { Wilson 3 } He believed that by studying public administration governmental efficiency could be increased. { &quot; The Study of Administration &quot; in Political Science Quarterly, June 1887 } Wilson was concerned with the implementation of government. He faulted political leaders who focused on philosophical issues and the nature of government and dismissed the critical issues of government administration as mere &quot; practical detail &quot;. He thought such attitudes represented the requirements of smaller countries and populations. By his day, he thought, &quot; it is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one. &quot; { Wilson, 4 } He thought it time &quot; to straighten the paths of government, to make its business less unbusinesslike, to strengthen and purify its organization, and it to crown its dutifulness &quot;. { Wilson 5 } He complained that studies of administration drew principally on the history of Continental Europe and an American equivalent was required. He summarized the growth of such foreign states as Prussia, France, and England, highlighting the events that led to advances in administration. By contrast, he thought the United States required greater compromise because of the diversity of public opinion and the difficulty of forming a majority opinion. Thus practical reform to the government is necessarily slow. Yet Wilson insisted that &quot; administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics &quot; { Wilson, 10 } and that &quot; general laws which direct these things to be done are as obviously outside of and above administration. &quot; { Wilson, 11 } He likens administration to a machine that functions independent of the changing mood of its leaders. Such a line of demarcation is intended to focus responsibility for actions taken on the people or persons in charge. As Wilson put it, &quot; public attention must be easily directed, in each case of good or bad administration, to just the man deserving of praise or blame. There is no danger in power, if only it be not irresponsible. If it be divided, dealt out in share to many, it is obscured... &quot; { Wilson, 12 } Essentially, the items under the discretion of administration must be limited in scope, as to not block, nullify, obfuscate, or modify the implementation of governmental decree made by the executive branch. [ President of Princeton University ] { Princeton&apos;s campus, was Wilson&apos;s home during his term as president of the university. } The trustees promoted Professor Wilson to president of Princeton in 1902, replacing Francis Landey Patton, whom the Trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator. Although the school&apos;s endowment was barely $4  million, Wilson sought $2  million for a preceptorial system of teaching, $1  million for a school of science, and nearly $3  million for new buildings and salary increases. As a long-term objective, Wilson sought $3  million for a graduate school and $2.5  million for schools of jurisprudence and electrical engineering, as well as a museum of natural history. { Walworth v. 1 } He was also able to increase the faculty from 112 to 174, most of whom he selected himself on the basis of their records as outstanding teachers. The curriculum guidelines he developed proved important progressive innovations in the field of higher education. { Walworth v. 1; Bragdon, Woodrow Wilson: The Academic Years (1967) } To emphasize the development of expertise, Wilson instituted academic departments and a system of core requirements where students met in groups of six with preceptors, followed by two years of concentration in a selected major. He tried to raise admission standards and to replace the &quot; gentleman&apos;s C &quot; with serious study. Wilson aspired, as he told alumni, &quot; to transform thoughtless boys performing tasks into thinking men &quot;. { Bragdon, Woodrow Wilson: The Academic Years; Walworth v. 1; Link (1947) } In 1906–10, he attempted to curtail the influence of social elites by abolishing the upper-class eating club s and moving the students into colleges, also known as quadrangles. Wilson&apos;s Quad Plan was met with fierce opposition from Princeton&apos;s alumni, most importantly Moses Taylor Pyne, the most powerful of Princeton&apos;s Trustees. Wilson held his position, saying that giving in &quot; would be to temporize with evil &quot;. { Walworth 1:109 } In October 1907, due to the intensity of alumni opposition, the Board of Trustees withdrew its support for the Quad Plan and instructed Wilson to withdraw it. { Bragdon, Woodrow Wilson: The Academic Years, 326–327. } Late in his tenure, Wilson confronted Andrew Fleming West, Dean of the graduate school, and West&apos;s ally former President Grover Cleveland who was a trustee. Wilson wanted to integrate the proposed graduate building into the same area with the undergraduate colleges. West wanted them to remain separate. The trustees rejected Wilson&apos;s plan for colleges in 1908, and then endorsed West&apos;s alternative in 1909. The national press covered the confrontation as a battle of the elites represented by West versus democracy represented by Wilson. { Around 1910 Wilson engaged in long meetings in Bermuda with socialite Mary Hulbert Peck. Historians are unsure whether there was an affair. There is no evidence but Wilson did send very personal letters, and ugly rumors were circulated by his political enemies in 1912. Cooper (2009) pp. 99–101. } It was this confrontation that led to his decision to leave Princeton for politics. He later commented that politics was less brutal than university administration. { Cooper, John Milton. &quot; Woodrow Wilson: A Biography &quot;. p107 } Wilson was elected president of the American Political Science Association in 1910, but soon decided to leave his Princeton post and enter New Jersey state politics. { Walworth, v 1 ch 6, 7, 8 } According to historian John Cooper, Wilson&apos;s tenure set Princeton on the path to become one of America&apos;s great universities. { Cooper, John Milton. &quot; Woodrow Wilson: A Biography &quot;. p119 } [ Governor of New Jersey ] In 1910 Wilson ran for Governor of New Jersey against the Republican candidate Vivian M. Lewis, the State Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. Wilson&apos;s campaign focused on his independence from machine politics, and he promised that if elected he would not be beholden to party bosses. Wilson soundly defeated Lewis in the general election by a margin of more than 49,000 votes, although Republican William Howard Taft had carried New Jersey in the 1908 presidential election by more than 80,000 votes. { Biography of Woodrow Wilson (PDF), } { New Jersey State Library. } Historian and Teddy Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris called Wilson in the Governor&apos;s race a &quot; dark horse &quot; and attributed his and others&apos; success against the Taft Republicans in 1910 in part to the emergent national progressive message enunciated by Roosevelt in his post-presidency. { Morris, Edmund, &quot; The Tea Party Last Time, } { Op-ed, The New York Times, October 31, 2010 (November 1, 2010 p. A33 NY ed.). Retrieved November 1, 2010. } In the 1910 election the Democrats also took control of the General Assembly. The State Senate, however, remained in Republican control by a slim margin. After taking office, Wilson set in place his reformist agenda, ignoring the demands of party machinery. While governor, in a period spanning six months, Wilson established state primaries. This all but took the party bosses out of the presidential election process in the state. He also revamped the public utility commission, and introduced worker&apos;s compensation. { Shenkman, Richard. p. 275. Presidential Ambition. New York, New York. Harper Collins Publishing, 1999. First Edition. 0-06-018373-X } [ Election of 1912 ] [ United States presidential election, 1912 ] Wilson&apos;s popularity as governor and his status in the national media gave impetus to his presidential campaign in 1912. He chose Indiana Governor Thomas R. Marshall as his running mate { Cooper (2009), 163–68 } and selected William Frank McCombs, a New York lawyer and a friend from college days, to manage his campaign. Much of Wilson&apos;s support came from the South, especially from young progressives in that region, especially intellectuals, editors and lawyers. Wilson managed to maneuver through the complexities of local politics. For example, in Tennessee the Democratic Party was divided on the issue of prohibition. Wilson was progressive and sober, but not a dry, and appealed to both sides. They united behind him to win the presidential election in the state, but divided over state politics and lost the gubernatorial election. { Arthur S. Link, &quot; Democratic Politics and the Presidential Campaign of 1912 in Tennessee &quot;, East Tennessee Historical Society&apos;s Publications 1979 51: 114–137 } The convention deadlocked for more than 40 ballots as no candidate could reach the two-thirds vote required to win the nomination. A leading contender was House Speaker Champ Clark, a prominent progressive strongest in the border states. Other contenders were Governor Judson Harmon of Ohio, and Representative Oscar Underwood of Alabama. They lacked Wilson&apos;s charisma and dynamism. Publisher William Randolph Hearst, a leader of the left wing of the party, supported Clark. William Jennings Bryan, the nominee in 1896, 1900 and 1908, played a critical role in opposition to any candidate who had the support of &quot; the financiers of Wall Street &quot;. He finally announced for Wilson, who won on the 46th ballot. { Arthur S. Link, &quot; The Baltimore Convention of 1912 &quot;, American Historical Review 1945 50(4): 691–713 in JSTOR } In the campaign Wilson promoted the &quot; New Freedom &quot;, emphasizing limited federal government and opposition to monopoly powers, often after consultation with his chief advisor Louis D. Brandeis. In the contest for the Republican nomination, President William Howard Taft defeated former president Theodore Roosevelt, who then ran as a Bull Moose Party candidate, which assisted in Wilson&apos;s success in the electoral college. Wilson took 41.8% of the popular vote and won 435 electoral votes from 40 states. { Lewis L.

Since 1856 he and Grover Cleveland were the only Democrats elected president, so felt a need to appoint Democrats to all federal positions. { Arthur S.

With large Democratic majorities in Congress and a healthy economy, he promptly seized the opportunity to implement his agenda. { Link (1972) } Wilson experienced early success by implementing his &quot; New Freedom &quot; pledges of antitrust modification, tariff revision, and reform in banking and currency matters. { Clements, Presidency ch. 3 } He held the first modern presidential press conference, on March 15, 1913, in which reporters were allowed to ask him questions.

[ Federal Reserve 1913 ] Wilson secured passage of the Federal Reserve Act in late 1913. Wilson had tried to find a middle ground between conservative Republicans, led by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, and the powerful left wing of the Democratic party, led by William Jennings Bryan, who opposed all banking schemes and strenuously denounced private banks and Wall Street. The latter group wanted a government-owned central bank that could print paper money as Congress required. The compromise, based on the Aldrich Plan but sponsored by Democratic Congressmen Carter Glass and Robert Owen, allowed the private banks to control the 12 regional Federal Reserve Bank s, but appeased the agrarians by placing controlling interest in the System in a central board appointed by the president with Senate approval. Moreover, Wilson convinced Bryan&apos;s supporters that because Federal Reserve notes were obligations of the government, the plan met their demands for an elastic currency. Having 12 regional banks was meant to weaken the influence of the powerful New York banks, a key demand of Bryan&apos;s allies in the South and West. This decentralization was a key factor in winning Glass&apos; support. { Link (1954) pp 43–53 } The final plan passed in December 1913. Some bankers felt it gave too much control to Washington, and some reformers felt it allowed bankers to maintain too much power. Several Congressmen claimed that New York bankers feigned their disapproval. { Clements, Presidency, pp. 40–44. } Wilson named Paul Warburg and other prominent bankers to direct the new system. While power was supposed to be decentralized, the New York branch dominated the Fed as the &quot; first among equals &quot;.

Link, &apos; &quot; Wilson: The New Freedom&apos;&apos; (1956) pp 177–98 } Wilson proved especially effective in mobilizing public opinion behind tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists, addressing Congress in person in highly dramatic fashion, and staging an elaborate ceremony when he signed the bill into law. { Vincent W. Howard, &quot; Woodrow Wilson, The Press, and Presidential Leadership: Another Look at the Passage of the Underwood Tariff, 1913, &quot; CR: The Centennial Review, 1980, Vol. 24 Issue 2, pp 167–184 } The revenue lost by a lower tariff was replaced by a new federal income tax, authorized by the 16th Amendment. He managed to bring all sides together on the issues of money and banking by the creation in 1913 of the Federal Reserve System, a complex business-government partnership that to this day dominates the financial world. { Link, &apos; &quot; Wilson: The New Freedom&apos;&apos; pp 199–240 } Wilson helped end the long battles over the trusts with the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. { Link, &apos; &quot; Wilson: The New Freedom&apos;&apos; pp 417–44 } Reaching out to new constituencies, a series of programs were targeted at farmers. The Smith–Lever Act of 1914 created the modern system of agricultural extension agents sponsored by the state agricultural colleges. The agents taught new techniques to farmers. The 1916 Federal Farm Loan Act provided for issuance of low-cost long-term mortgages to farmers. { Clements, Presidency, ch 4. } Child labor was curtailed by the Keating–Owen Act of 1916, but the U.S. Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in 1918. No major child labor prohibition would take effect until the 1930s. { H.D. Hindman Child labor: an American history (2002) } The railroad brotherhoods threatened in summer 1916 to shut down the national transportation system. Wilson tried to bring labor and management together, but when management refused, he had Congress pass the Adamson Act in September 1916, which avoided the strike by imposing an 8-hour workday in the industry (at the same pay as before). It helped Wilson gain union support for his reelection; the act was approved by the Supreme Court. Much of this agenda would later serve as an example or a basis of support for the New Deal. Wilson uses tariff, currency and anti-trust laws to prime the pump and get the economy working in a 1913 political cartoon [ Antitrust ] Wilson broke with the big lawsuit tradition of his predecessors Taft and Roosevelt as Trustbusters, finding a new approach to encouraging competition through the Federal Trade Commission, which stopped perceived unfair trade practices. In addition, he pushed through Congress the Clayton Antitrust Act making certain business practices illegal (such as price discrimination, agreements prohibiting retailers from handling other companies&apos; products, and directorates and agreements to control other companies). The power of this legislation was greater than previous anti-trust laws, because individual officers of corporations could be held responsible if their companies violated the laws. More importantly, the new laws set out clear guidelines that corporations could follow, a dramatic improvement over the previous uncertainties. This law was considered the &quot; Magna Carta &quot; of labor by Samuel Gompers because it ended union liability antitrust laws. In 1916, under threat of a national railroad strike, he approved legislation that increased wages and cut working hours of railroad employees; there was no strike. [ Carlos D.

He offered to be a mediator, but neither the Allies nor the Central Powers took his requests seriously. Republicans, led by Theodore Roosevelt, strongly criticized Wilson&apos;s refusal to build up the U.S. Army in anticipation of the threat of war. Wilson won the support of the peace element (especially women and churches) by arguing that an army buildup would provoke war. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, whose pacifist recommendations were ignored by Wilson, resigned in 1915. { Clements, Presidency, ch. 7. } On December 18, 1916, Wilson unsuccessfully offered to mediate peace. As a preliminary he asked both sides to state their minimum terms necessary for future security. The Central Powers replied that victory was certain, and the Allies required the dismemberment of their enemies&apos; empires. No desire for peace or common ground existed, and the offer lapsed. { Cooper, Woodrow Wilson (2009) pp 362–76 } While German submarines were killing sailors and civilian passengers Wilson demanded that Germany stop, but he kept the U.S. out of the war. Britain had declared a blockade of Germany to prevent neutral ships from carrying contraband goods to Germany. Wilson protested some British violation of neutral rights, where no one was killed. His protests were mild, and the British knew America would not see it as a casus belli. [ Election of 1916 ] [ United States presidential election, 1916 ] Renominated in 1916, Wilson used as a major campaign slogan &quot; He kept us out of war &quot;, referring to his administration&apos;s avoiding open conflict with Germany or Mexico while maintaining a firm national policy. Wilson, however, never promised to keep out of war regardless of provocation. In his acceptance speech on September 2, 1916, Wilson pointedly warned Germany that submarine warfare that took American lives would not be tolerated, saying &quot; The nation that violates these essential rights must expect to be checked and called to account by direct challenge and resistance. It at once makes the quarrel in part our own. &quot; [ http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid%3D65393 Woodrow Wilson: Speech of Acceptance Presidency.ucsb.edu September 2, 1916 September 11, 2010 ] Wilson narrowly won the election, defeating Republican candidate Charles Evans Hughes. As governor of New York from 1907–1910, Hughes had a progressive record strikingly similar to Wilson&apos;s as governor of New Jersey. Theodore Roosevelt would comment that the only thing different between Hughes and Wilson was a shave. However, Hughes had to try to hold together a coalition of conservative Taft supporters and progressive Roosevelt partisans and so his campaign never seemed to take a definite form. Wilson ran on his record and ignored Hughes, reserving his attacks for Roosevelt. When asked why he did not attack Hughes directly, Wilson told a friend to &quot; Never murder a man who is committing suicide. &quot; { The American Presidency Project Wilson quote } The result was exceptionally close and the outcome was in doubt for several days. The vote came down to several close states. Wilson won California by 3,773 votes out of almost a million votes cast and New Hampshire by 54 votes. Hughes won Minnesota by 393 votes out of over 358,000. In the final count, Wilson had 277 electoral votes vs. Hughes 254. Wilson was able to win by picking up many votes that had gone to Teddy Roosevelt or Eugene V. Debs in 1912. { William M.

Wilson warned citizens not to take sides in the war for fear of endangering wider U.S. policy. In his address to Congress in 1914, Wilson stated, &quot; Such divisions amongst us would be fatal to our peace of mind and might seriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the one great nation at peace, the one people holding itself ready to play a part of impartial mediation and speak the counsels of peace and accommodation, not as a partisan, but as a friend. &quot; { &quot; Primary Documents: U.S. Declaration of Neutrality, August 19, 1914 &quot;, accessed January 7, 2002. } The U.S. maintained neutrality despite increasing pressure placed on Wilson after the sinking of the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania with American citizens on board. Wilson found it increasingly difficult to maintain U.S. neutrality after Germany, despite its promises in the Arabic pledge and the Sussex pledge, initiated a program of unrestricted submarine warfare early in 1917 that threatened U.S. commercial shipping. Following the revelation of the Zimmermann Telegram, Germany&apos;s attempt to enlist Mexico as an ally against the U.S., Wilson took America into World War I to make &quot; the world safe for democracy. &quot; The U.S. did not sign a formal alliance with the United Kingdom or France but operated as an &quot; associated &quot; power. The U.S. raised a massive army through conscription and Wilson gave command to General John J. Pershing, allowing Pershing a free hand as to tactics, strategy and even diplomacy. { Edward M. Coffman, The War to End All Wars (1968) ch. 3 } Wilson had decided by then that the war had become a real threat to humanity. Unless the U.S. threw its weight into the war, as he stated in his declaration of war speech on April 2, 1917, [ Michael Duffy http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/usawardeclaration.htm Declaration of war speech FirstWorldWar.com August 22, 2009 September 11, 2010 ] western civilization itself could be destroyed. His statement announcing a &quot; war to end war &quot; meant that he wanted to build a basis for peace that would prevent future catastrophic wars and needless death and destruction. This provided the basis of Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points, which were intended to resolve territorial disputes, ensure free trade and commerce, and establish a peacemaking organization. Included in these fourteen points was the proposal for the League of Nations. { Clements, Presidency, ch 7–8 } [ War Message ] President Wilson delivering his war message before Congress. April 2, 1917. Woodrow Wilson delivered his War Message to Congress on the evening of April 2, 1917. Introduced to great applause, he remained intense and almost motionless for the entire speech, only raising one arm as his only bodily movement. { Baker, Ray Stannard, Woodrow Wilson Life and Letters (Garden City, NY, 1937) } Wilson announced that his previous position of &quot; armed neutrality &quot; was no longer tenable now that the Imperial German Government had announced that it would use its submarines to sink any vessel approaching the ports of Great Britain, Ireland or any of the Western Coasts of Europe. He advised Congress to declare that the recent course of action taken by the Imperial German Government constituted an act of war. He proposed that the United States enter the war to &quot; vindicate principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power &quot;. He also charged that Germany had &quot; filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without our industries and our commerce &quot;. Furthermore, the United States had intercepted a telegram sent to the German ambassador in Mexico City that evidenced Germany&apos;s attempt to instigate a Mexican attack upon the U.S. The German government, Wilson said, &quot; means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors &quot;. He then warned that &quot; if there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with a firm hand of repression. &quot; { Cooper, John Milton, Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace, Baltimore MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, ISBN 978-0-8018-9074-1 (2008), p. 190: Wilson insisted that those who refused to support the nation in time of war surrendered their civil liberties. } Wilson closed with the statement that the world must be again safe for democracy.

It was the clearest expression of intention made by any of the belligerent nations. The speech, authored principally by Walter Lippmann, expressed Wilson&apos;s progressive domestic policies into comparably idealistic equivalents for the international arena: self-determination, open agreements, international cooperation. Promptly dubbed the Fourteen Points, Wilson attempted to make them the basis for the treaty that would mark the end of the war. They ranged from the most generic principles like the prohibition of secret treaties to such detailed outcomes as the creation of an independent Poland with access to the sea.

While he welcomed socialists who supported the war, he pushed at the same time to arrest and deport foreign-born radicals. { Avrich, Paul, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background, Princeton: Princeton University Press, ISBN 0-691-02604-1, ISBN 978-0-691-02604-6 (1991), pp. 93–94, 124, 127, 130–133 } Citing the Espionage Act, the U.S. Post Office, following the instructions of the Justice Department, refused to carry any written materials that could be deemed critical of the U.S. war effort. Some sixty newspapers judged to have revolutionary or antiwar content were deprived of their second-class mailing rights and effectively banned from the U.S. mails. { Clements, Presidency ch 8 } Mere criticism of the Wilson administration and its war policy became grounds for arrest and imprisonment. A Jewish immigrant from Germany, Robert Goldstein, was sentenced to ten years in prison for producing The Spirit of &apos;76, a film that portrayed the British, now an ally, in an unfavorable light. { Loewen, James W., Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong, Touchstone Books (1995), p. 20, 22, 24 } Wilson&apos;s domestic economic policies were strongly pro-labor, but this favorable treatment was extended only to unions that supported the U.S. war effort, such as the American Federation of Labor (AFL). { Gompers Pledges Labor&apos;s Support for WWI, History Channel Online, retrieved July 21, 2011 } Antiwar groups, anarchists, communists, I.W.W. members, and other radical labor movements were regularly targeted by agents of the Department of Justice; many of their leaders were arrested on grounds of incitement to violence, espionage, or sedition. { McElroy, Wendy, World War I and the Suppression of Dissent, Parts 1 and 2, Freedom Daily, The Future of Freedom Foundation (April 2002), retrieved July 20, 2011 } By 1918 the ranks of those arrested included Eugene Debs, the mild-mannered Socialist Party leader and labor activist, after he gave a speech opposing the war. { Cooper, John Milton, Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, ISBN 978-0-8018-9074-1 (2008), p. 201, 209 } Debs&apos; opposition to the Wilson administration and the war earned the undying enmity of President Wilson, who later called Debs a &quot; traitor to his country &quot;. Many recent foreign immigrants, resident aliens who opposed America&apos;s participation in World War I were eventually deported to Soviet Russia or other nations under the sweeping powers granted in the Immigration Act of 1918, which had actually been drafted by Wilson administration officials at the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Immigration. Even after the war ended in November 1918, the Wilson administration&apos;s attempts to silence radical political opponents continued, culminating in the Palmer Raids, a mass arrest and roundup of some 10,000 anarchists and labor activists led by Wilson&apos;s Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer. { Norton, Mary Beth, A People and a Nation: A History of the United States Since 1865: Vol 2, Wadsworth Publishing, ISBN 0-618-39177-0, ISBN 978-0-618-39177-6 (2006), p. 681 } The investigations and prosecutions of antiwar activists by the Department of Justice were heavily criticized by prominent lawyers and law professors of the day, including Felix Frankfurter and Roscoe Pound. { On May 28, 1920, the } { American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) published A Report of the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice which documented the activities of the Justice Department under Attorney Generals } { Thomas Watt Gregory and } { A.

As there was no rationing, consumer prices soared. As income taxes increased, white-collar worker s suffered. Despite this, appeals to buy war bond s were highly successful. The purchase of wartime bonds had the result of shifting the cost of the war to the affluent 1920s. Wilson set up the first western propaganda office, the United States Committee on Public Information, headed by George Creel (thus its popular name, Creel Commission), which filled the country with patriotic anti-German appeals and conducted various forms of censorship. { Records of the Committee on Public Information from the } { National Archives } In 1917, Congress authorized ex-President Theodore Roosevelt to raise four divisions of volunteers to fight in France- Roosevelt&apos;s World War I volunteers; Wilson refused to accept this offer from his political enemy. Other areas of the war effort were incorporated into the government along with propaganda. The War Industries Board headed by Bernard Baruch set war goals and policies for American factories. Future President Herbert Hoover was appointed to head the Food Administration which encouraged Americans to participate in &quot; Meatless Mondays &quot; and &quot; Wheatless Wednesdays &quot; to conserve food for the troops overseas. The Federal Fuel Administration run by Henry Garfield introduced daylight savings time and rationed fuel supplies such as coal and oil to keep the U.S. military supplied. These and many other boards and administrations were headed by businessmen recruited by Wilson for a dollar a day salary to make the government more efficient in the war effort. [ Other foreign affairs ] In anticipation of the opening of the Panama Canal, Britain protested that U.S. plans to exempt U.S. vessels traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the U.S. from tolls, in accordance with the Panama Canal Act of 1912, violated the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty. On March 5, 1914, Wilson sent a message to Congress strongly urging the repeal of the exemption. He regarded the exemption as a plain breach of the Treaty and proposed a &quot; voluntary withdrawal from a position everywhere questioned and misunderstood. &quot; In spite of strong opposition within his own party, he forced Democrats in Congress to support a repeal of the exemption. { John Milton Cooper, Jr., Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (NY, 2009), 249–50 } In principal Wilson wanted to avoid the aggressive stance Theodore Roosevelt had taken toward Latin America. For example, he negotiated a treaty with Colombia in which the U.S. apologized for its role in the Panama Revolution of 1903–1904. { Cooper, Woodrow Wilson (2009), 381 } In practice, he did not shrink from intervention on behalf of American values, saying in 1913: &quot; I am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men. &quot; { Paul Horgan, Great River: the Rio Grande in North American History (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1984), 913 } Between 1914 and 1918, the United States intervened in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, Haiti, Cuba, and Panama. The U.S. maintained troops in Nicaragua throughout the Wilson administration and used them to select the president of Nicaragua and then to force Nicaragua to pass the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty. American troops in Haiti, under the command of the federal government, forced the Haitian legislature to choose the candidate Wilson selected as Haitian president. American troops occupied Haiti between 1915 and 1934. { Clements, Presidency 103–6 } Wilson ordered the military occupation of the Dominican Republic shortly after the resignation of its President Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra in 1916. The U.S. military worked in concert with wealthy Dominican landowners to suppress the gavilleros, a campesino guerrilla force fighting the occupation. The occupation lasted until 1924, and was notorious for its brutality against those in the resistance.

Kennan, Russia Leaves the War, p. 472, et passim. 1956, repr. 1989, ISBN 0-691-00841-8. } Wilson sent armed forces to assist the withdrawal of Czechoslovak Legions along the Trans-Siberian Railway, hold key port cities at Arkangel and Vladivostok. Though not sent to engage the Bolsheviks, the U.S. forces engaged in several armed conflicts against forces of the new Russian government. Despite the apparent innocuousness of Wilson&apos;s motives, revolutionaries in Russia resented the American intrusion. As Robert Maddox puts it, &quot; The immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war, thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society. &quot; { Robert J. Maddox, The Unknown War with Russia (San Rafael, CA: Presidio Press, 1977), 137. } Wilson withdrew most of the soldiers on April 1, 1920, though some remained until as late as 1922. In 1919 Wilson guided American foreign policy to &quot; acquiesce &quot; in the Balfour Declaration without supporting Zionism in an official way. Wilson expressed sympathy for the plight of Jews, especially in Poland and in France. { Walworth (1986) 473–83, esp. p. 481; Melvin I.

[ Peace Conference 1919 ] [ Paris Peace Conference, 1919 ] After World War I, Wilson participated in negotiations with the stated aim of assuring statehood for formerly oppressed nations and an equitable peace. On January 8, 1918, Wilson made his famous Fourteen Points address, introducing the idea of a League of Nations, an organization with a stated goal of helping to preserve territorial integrity and political independence among large and small nations alike. { Cooper, Woodrow Wilson, pp 420–453 } Wilson intended the Fourteen Points as a means toward ending the war and achieving an equitable peace for all the nations. He spent six months in Paris for the Peace Conference (making him the first U.S. president to travel to Europe while in office). He worked tirelessly to promote his plan. The charter of the proposed League of Nations was incorporated into the conference&apos;s Treaty of Versailles. { Arnold M. Rice, John A. Krout, United States History From 1865, (HarperCollins, 1991), p. 180. } Japan proposed that the Covenant include a racial equality clause. Wilson was indifferent to the issue, but acceded to strong opposition from Australia and Britain. { Naoko Shimazu, Japan, Race, and Equality: The Racial Equality Proposal of 1919 (NY: Routledge, 1998), 154ff, available online } When Wilson traveled to Europe to settle the peace terms, he visited Pope Benedict XV in Rome, making Wilson the first American President to visit the Pope while in office. Wilson returning from the Versailles Peace Conference, 1919. For his peace-making efforts, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize. [ Treaty fight, 1919 ] The next question was whether the United States Senate would approve the treaty by the required two-thirds vote. On September 3, 1919, Wilson embarked on a cross-country speaking tour in an attempt to rally the nation to his support, despite the intense opposition from Irish Catholics and Germans, most of them Democrats. Wilson had a series of debilitating strokes and had to cancel his trip on September 26, 1919. He became an invalid in the White House, closely monitored or controlled by his wife. Republicans under Senator Lodge controlled both houses of Congress after the 1918 elections. The key point of disagreement was whether the League would diminish the power of Congress to declare war. The Senate was divided into a crazy quilt of positions on the Versailles question. { Cooper, Woodrow Wilson, 507–560 } It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build the two-thirds coalition needed to pass a treaty. { Thomas A. Bailey, Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal (1945) } One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Senator Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article X, which involved the power of the League Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress. Finally, a bipartisan group of 13 &quot; irreconcilables &quot; opposed a treaty in any form. { Ralph A. Stone (1970). The Irreconcilables: The Fight Against the League of Nations. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky. } The closest the Treaty came to passage came in mid-November 1919 when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to permanently end the chances for ratification. Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson&apos;s stroke on September 25, 1919, had so altered his personality that he was unable to effectively negotiate with Lodge. Cooper says, the psychological effects of a stroke were profound: &quot; Wilson&apos;s emotions were unbalanced, and his judgment was warped....Worse, his denial of illness and limitations was starting to border on delusion. &quot; { Cooper, Woodrow Wilson, 544, 557–560; Bailey calls Wilson&apos;s rejection, &quot; The Supreme Infanticide, &quot; Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal (1945) p. 271. } During this period, Wilson became less trustful of the press and stopped holding press conferences for them, preferring to use his propaganda unit, the Committee for Public Information, instead. A poll of historians in 2006 cited Wilson&apos;s failure to compromise with the Republicans on U.S. entry into the League as one of the 10 largest errors on the part of an American president. { http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060218/presidential_errors_060218/20060218?hub=World } [ Post war: 1919–1920 ] Wilson&apos;s administration did not plan for the process of demobilization at the war&apos;s end. Though some advisers tried to engage the President&apos;s attention to what they called &quot; reconstruction &quot;, his tepid support for a federal commission evaporated with the election of 1918. Republican gains in the Senate meant that his opposition would have to consent to the appointment of commission members. Instead, Wilson favored the prompt dismantling of wartime boards and regulatory agencies. { David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First Wold War and American Society (NY: Oxford University Press, 2004) 249–50 } Demobilization proved chaotic and violent. Four million soldiers were sent home with little planning, little money, and few benefits. A wartime bubble in prices of farmland burst, leaving many farmers bankrupt or deeply in debt after they purchased new land. Major strikes in steel, coal, and meatpacking followed in 1919. { Leonard Williams Levy and Louis Fisher, Encyclopedia of the American Presidency, Simon and Schuster: 1994, p. 494.

He imagined and sometimes pretended he was healthy enough for the effort, but several times admitted that he knew he could not survive a campaign. No one around the President dared tell him that he was incapable and that the campaign for the League was already lost. At the Convention in late June 1920, some Wilson partisans made efforts on his behalf and sent Wilson hopeful reports, but they were quashed by Wilson&apos;s wiser friends. { David Pietrusza, 1920: The Year of Six Presidents (NY: Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, 2007), 191–2, 198–200, 253 } [ Incapacity ] { Edith holds a document steady while he signs.
