He remained in obscurity there for many years. In 2003, the American military, needing personnel to work rebuilding Iraq &apos;s infrastructure, contracted him as a fumigator to work on Iraqi homes that had been decaying and infected with insects during Saddam Hussein &apos;s presidency. The military did not know of Watkins&apos; background as a boxer. In 2008, writer Suzy Pepper, a former neighbor of Maurice Watkins, released &quot; Termite &quot;, a biographical book about Mr. Watkins. Also in 2008, a movie based on the book was announced. [ In Iraq ] After the IOC announced that Iraq would be allowed to compete in seven sports at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, including boxing, the United States military, overviewing the new Iraqi Olympic committee, set about to find a new boxing coach for the Iraqi national boxing team. With research, they found out about Watkins&apos; background, and invited him to coach a team of young hopefuls in Baghdad. When Watkins arrived there, he saw what he described to a Sports Illustrated columnist as not too much talent, but a lot of heart. Realizing he needed to train the team in a setting different from Baghdad, he moved his team to a city close to Baghdad, but much quieter than the capital city. He trained nine Iraqi boxers who hoped to reach the Olympics, but, out of those, only Najah Ali was able to qualify for the games. During the training period of these young prospects, he invented a phrase that has become widely popular in Iraq: Every morning, after arrival to the gym, he would chant Iraq! Iraq! Iraq is back! to help inspire his boxers. The phrase has become so popular in Iraq that the United States military has ordered 1,000 t-shirts to be printed with the phrase, to be handled among Iraqi citizens.
