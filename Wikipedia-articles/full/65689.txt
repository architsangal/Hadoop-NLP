He became the fourth Archbishop of San Salvador, succeeding Luis Chávez. He was assassinated on 24 March 1980. After his assassination, Romero was succeeded by Monsignor Arturo Rivera. In 1997, a cause for beatification and canonization into sainthood was opened for Romero, and Pope John Paul II bestowed upon him the title of Servant of God. The canonization process continues.

Outside of Catholicism, Romero is honored by other religious denomination s of Christendom, including the Church of England through the Calendar in Common Worship. He is one of the ten 20th century martyrs who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey in London, a testament to his wide respect even beyond the Catholic Church. [ http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/oscar-romero Westminster Abbey: Oscar Romero 2011-03-20 ] In 2008, he was chosen as one of the 15 Champions of World Democracy by the Europe-based magazine A Different View. { A Different View, Issue 19, January 2008. } [ Early life ] Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez was born on 15 August 1917, to Santos Romero and Guadalupe de Jésus Galdámez in Ciudad Barrios. He lived in a torn country where 40% of the land was owned by 13 families. The church was being persecuted at this time and many were being killed or assassinated. { Coat of Arms of bishop Óscar A. Romero } On 11 May 1919, at the age of one, Óscar was baptised into the Catholic Church by Fr. Cecilio Morales. He had 5 brothers and 2 sisters: Gustavo, Zaída, Rómulo, Mamerto, Arnoldo and Gaspar, and Aminta (who died shortly after birth.) He could often be found at one of the town&apos;s two churches during his free time. At age seven Romero came down with an unknown life-threatening illness, from which he eventually recovered. Romero entered (government funded) Public school, which only offered grades one through three. When finished with public school, Romero was privately tutored by Anita Iglesias till the age of thirteen. Throughout this time Óscar&apos;s father, Santos, had been training Romero in carpentry. Romero showed exceptional proficiency as an apprentice. Santos wanted to offer his son the skill of a trade, because in El Salvador studies seldom led to employment. [ Priesthood ] On 4 April 1942, Romero was ordained a Catholic priest in Rome. Romero remained in Italy to obtain a doctoral degree in theology which specialized in ascetical theology. In 1943 before finishing, he was summoned back home from Fascist Italy by the bishop at the age of 26. He traveled home with his good friend Father Valladares, who was also doing doctoral work in Rome. On the route home they made stops in Spain and Cuba, being detained by Cuban police for having come from Benito Mussolini&apos;s Italy and placed in an internment camp. After several months in prison Valladares became sick and some priests of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer helped to have the two transferred to a hospital. From the hospital they were released from Cuban custody and allowed back home, where they sailed for Mexico and then back home to El Salvador. Romero worked as a parish priest in Anamorós but then moved to San Miguel where he worked for over 20 years. He promoted various apostolic groups, started an Alcoholics Anonymous group, helped in the construction of San Miguel&apos;s cathedral and supported devotion to the Virgin of the Peace. He was later appointed Rector of the inter-diocese seminary in San Salvador.In 1966, he began his public life when chosen to be the Secretary of the Bishop Conference for El Salvador. He also became the director of the archdiocesan newspaper Orientación, which became fairly conservative while he was editor, defending the traditional magisterium of the Catholic Church. In 1970 he was appointed auxiliary bishop to San Salvador Archbishop Luis Chávez y González, a move not welcomed by the more progressive members of the Priesthood in El Salvador. He took up his appointment as Bishop of the Diocese of Santiago de María in December 1975. [ Archbishop ] A bust of Óscar Romero On 23 February 1977, he was appointed Archbishop of El Salvador. His appointment was met with surprise, dismay, and even incredulity. While this appointment was welcomed by the government, many priests were disappointed, especially those openly aligning with Marxism. The Marxist priests feared that his conservative reputation would negatively affect liberation theology &apos;s commitment to the poor. On 12 March 1977, Rutilio Grande, a progressive Jesuit priest and personal friend of Romero who had been creating self-reliance groups among the poor campesinos, was assassinated. His death had a profound impact on Romero, who later stated, &quot; When I looked at Rutilio lying there dead I thought, &apos;If they have killed him for doing what he did, then I too have to walk the same path&apos; &quot;.

Hayes (Chaplain Tombs, David 2001-04 ] {. } Romero urged Arturo Armando Molina &apos;s government to investigate, but they ignored his request. Furthermore, the censored press remained silent. { http://www.infed.org/thinkers/oscar_romero.htm } Tension was noted by the closure of schools and the lack of Catholic priests invited to participate in government. In response to Fr. Rutilio&apos;s murder, Romero revealed a radicalism that had not been evident earlier. Traditionally, the church had been complicit in the aims of the state and military to privilege the wealthy and powerful while the majority of the population remained in abject poverty. He spoke out against poverty, social injustice, assassinations and torture. { Eaton, Helen-May (1991). The impact of the Archbishop Oscar Romero&apos;s alliance with the struggle for liberation of the Salvadoran people: A discussion of church-state relations (El Salvador) (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University } In 1979, the Revolutionary Government Junta came to power amidst a wave of human rights abuses by paramilitary right-wing groups and the government. Romero criticized the United States for giving military aid to the new government and wrote to President Jimmy Carter in February 1980, warning that increased US military aid would &quot; undoubtedly sharpen the injustice and the repression inflicted on the organized people, whose struggle has often been for their most basic human rights &quot;. Carter, concerned that El Salvador would become &quot; another Nicaragua &quot; ignored Romero&apos;s pleas and continued military aid to the Salvadoran government. As a result of his humanitarian efforts, Romero began to be noticed internationally. In February 1980, he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Louvain. On his visit to Europe to receive this honor, he met Pope John Paul II and expressed his concerns at what was happening in his country. Romero argued that it was problematic to support the Salvadoran government because it legitimized terror and assassinations. Óscar Romero [ Statements on persecution of the Church ] Archbishop Romero denounced the persecution of members of the Catholic Church who had worked on behalf of the poor: [ In less than three years, more than fifty priests have been attacked, threatened, calumniated. Six are already martyr s -- they were murdered. Some have been torture d and others expelled [from the country]. Nuns have also been persecuted. The archdiocesan radio station and educational institutions that are Catholic or of a Christian inspiration have been attacked, threatened, intimidated, even bombed. Several parish communities have been raided. If all this has happened to persons who are the most evident representatives of the Church, you can guess what has happened to ordinary Christians, to the campesinos, catechists, lay minister s, and to the ecclesial base communities. There have been threats, arrests, tortures, murders, numbering in the hundreds and thousands.... But it is important to note why [the Church] has been persecuted. Not any and every priest has been persecuted, not any and every institution has been attacked. That part of the church has been attacked and persecuted that put itself on the side of the people and went to the people&apos;s defense. Here again we find the same key to understanding the persecution of the church: the poor. Óscar Romero Speech at the Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium, Feb. 2, 1980.

According to an audio-recording of the Mass, he was shot while elevating the chalice at the end of the Eucharist ic rite. [ July 2011 ] [ Funeral ] Romero was buried in the Metropolitan Cathedral of San Salvador (&apos;&apos;Catedral Metropolitana de San Salvador&apos;&apos;). The funeral mass (rite of visitation and requiem) on 30 March 1980, in San Salvador was attended by more than 250,000 mourners from all over the world. Viewing this attendance as a protest, Jesuit priest John Dear has said, &quot; Romero’s funeral was the largest demonstration in Salvadoran history, some say in the history of Latin America. &quot; During the ceremony, a smoke bomb exploded on the Cathedral square ( Plaza Gerardo Barrios ) and subsequently there were rifle-fire shots that came from surrounding buildings, including the National Palace. Many people were killed by gunfire and during the following mass panic; official sources talk of 31 overall casualties, journalists indicated between 30 and 50 dead. Some witnesses claimed it was government security forces that threw bombs into the crowd, and army sharpshooters, dressed as civilians, that fired into the chaos from the balcony or roof of the National Palace. However, there are contradictory accounts as to the course of the events and &quot; probably, one will never know the truth about the interrupted funeral. &quot; This proved to be a turning point in the history of the Salvadoran conflict, a peak in the power of popular organizations aligned with the left, whose popularity declined after this event. [ May 2012 ] Twenty-five years later, the BBC recalled the horror: &quot; Tens of thousands of mourners who had gathered for Romero&apos;s funeral Mass in front of the cathedral in San Salvador were filmed fleeing in terror as army gunners on the rooftops around the square opened fire.... One person who was there told us that piles of shoes were left behind by those who escaped with their lives. &quot; As the gunfire continued, the body was buried in a crypt beneath the sanctuary. Even after the burial, people continued to line up to pay homage to their martyred prelate.

This view was supported by ex-US ambassador Robert White, who in 1986 reported to the United States Congress that &quot; there was sufficient evidence &quot; to convict D&apos;Aubuisson of planning and ordering Archbishop Romero&apos;s assassination. [ Nordland Rod How 2 rose to vie for El Salvador&apos;s presidency Philadelphia Inquirer Philadelphia, PA March 23, 1984 A1 ] It was also supported in 1993 by an official U.N. report, which identified D&apos;Aubuisson as the man who ordered the killing. { Morozzo p. 351-2, 354, 364 } D&apos;Aubuisson was a graduate of the School of the Americas, and Noam Chomsky has asserted that his death squad was trained and funded by the United States. { http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Chomsky/ChomOdon_ElSalvador.html } D&apos;Aubuisson had also planned to overthrow the government in a coup. Later he founded the political party Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), and organized death squads that systematically carried out politically motivated assassinations and other human rights abuses in El Salvador. Álvaro Rafael Saravia, a former captain in the Salvadoran Air Force, was chief of security for Roberto D&apos;Aubuisson and an active member of these death squads. In 2003, a U.S. human rights organization, the Center for Justice and Accountability, filed a civil action against Saravia. In 2004, he was found liable by a US District Court under the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) (28 U.S.C. § 1350) for aiding, conspiring, and participating in the assassination of Archbishop Romero.

I have been thinking of how far a soul can ascend if it lets itself be possessed entirely by God. &quot; Commenting on this passage, James R. Brockman, S.J., Romero&apos;s biographer and author of Romero: A Life, said that &quot; All the evidence available indicates that he continued on his quest for holiness until the end of his life. But he also matured in that quest. &quot; [ http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/904242brock.html James R. Brockman, S.J.: The Spiritual Journey of Oscar Romero 2008-01-17 James Brockman, S.J. Spirituality Today ] According to Brockman, Romero&apos;s spiritual journey had some of these characteristics: love for the Church of Rome, shown by his episcopal motto, &quot; to be of one mind with the Church, &quot; a phrase he took from St. Ignatius &apos; Spiritual Exercises, a tendency to make a very deep examination of conscience, an emphasis on sincere piety, mortification and penance through his duties, providing protection for his chastity, spiritual direction (Romero said he &quot; entrusted with great satisfaction the spiritual direction of my life and that of other priests &quot; to priests of Opus Dei), &quot; being one with the Church incarnated in this people which stands in need of liberation, &quot; eagerness for contemplative prayer and finding God in others, fidelity to the will of God, self-offering to Jesus Christ. [ Process of canonization ] On the tenth anniversary of the assassination in 1990, the sitting prelate archbishop of San Salvador, Msgr. Arturo Rivera, appointed a postulator to prepare documentation for a cause of beatification and canonization of Romero. The documents were formally accepted by Pope John Paul II and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1997, and Romero was given the title of &quot; Servant of God &quot;. The process continues today with further investigation of the heroism and martyrdom of Romero. Upon the declaration of heroism and martyrdom, it is expected that Romero will achieve the title of &quot; Venerable &quot;. If the decree finds that Romero was a martyr, there would be no further obstacles to his beatification. A declaration of only heroic virtue, however, would require that a miracle must be attributed to Romero in order for him to be declared Blessed.

In March 2005, Monsignor Vincenzo Paglia, the Vatican official in charge of the drive, announced that Romero&apos;s cause had cleared an unprecedented hurdle, having survived a theological audit by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, at the time headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later elected Pope Benedict XVI ) and that beatification could follow within six months.

Asked if Msgr.

The charge has been dismissed by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints who have pointed out that Romero has not yet met certain criteria to move on to the next levels of the inquests, processes which have historically taken decades to roll into motion.

It was directed by John Duigan and starred Raúl Juliá and produced by Paulist Productions (a film company run by the Paulist Fathers, a Roman Catholic society of apostolic life of Catholic priests). Timed for release ten years after Romero&apos;s death, it was the first Hollywood feature film ever to be financed by the Roman Catholic Church. The film received respectful, if less than enthusiastic, reviews. Roger Ebert typified the critics who acknowledged that &quot; The film has a good heart, and the Juliá performance is an interesting one, restrained and considered.... The film&apos;s weakness is a certain implacable predictability. &quot; Romero by Roger Ebert 2008-04-14 Romero was never sent to jail as was in the movie, but was held at a detainment camp. Oliver Stone &apos;s 1986 film, Salvador, contains a dramatisation of the assassination of Archbishop Romero (played in the movie by José Carlos Ruiz ). The film tells the story of photojournalist Richard Boyle ( James Woods ), who undergoes a spiritual conversion while covering the death squad killings in El Salvador during the Civil War. Romero was also featured in the made-for-TV movie Choices of the Heart (NBC, 1983, René Enríquez as Romero) about the murder of four U.S. churchwomen in El Salvador. Romero was depicted in two biopics about the papacy of Karol Wojtyła, the U.S. television biopic Have No Fear: The Life of Pope John Paul II (ABC, 2005, Joaquim de Almeida as Romero) and the Italian biopic &quot; Karol, una papa rimasto uomo &quot; (2006, Carlos Kaniowsky as Romero). The Daily Show episode on 17 March 2010 showed clips from the Texas State Board of Education in which &quot; a panel of experts &quot; recommended including Romero in the state&apos;s history books, but an amendment proposed by Patricia Hardy to exclude Romero was passed on 10 March 2010. The clip of Ms. Hardy shows her arguing against including Romero because &quot; I guarantee you most of you did not know who Oscar Romero was &quot; and &quot; I just happen to think it&apos;s not [important] &quot;. Romero has also had a house at Cardijn College named after him. A film about the Archbishop, Monseñor, the Last Journey of Óscar Romero, had its U.S. premiere in 2010. It was sponsored by ecclesial and human rights groups from Latin America, and from North America. In her essay in The New York Review of Books, the film is described by Alma Guillermoprieto as a &quot; hagiography, &quot; and as &quot; an astonishing compilation of footage &quot; of the final three years of his life. [ Visual arts ] { Mother Elizabeth of Russia, Rev. } { Martin Luther King, Archbishop Óscar Romero and Pastor } { Dietrich Bonhoeffer } A statue of Óscar Romero sculpted by John Roberts fills a prominent niche on the western facade of Westminster Abbey in London. The statue was unveiled in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II in 1998. Barry Woods Johnston sculpted the statue of Óscar Romero displayed in the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. The Italian sculptor, Paolo Borghi crafted the catafalque that covers Romero&apos;s tomb in the crypt of the San Salvador cathedral and shows Romero &quot; sleeping the sleep of the just &quot; as four Evangelists stand guard. Br. Robert Lentz, OFM, painted a now-famous &quot; icon &quot; of Archbishop Romero based on traditional Church iconography but with updated the conventional elements. For example, traditional angels are replaced with military helicopters over red tiled roofs. Frank Diaz Escalet executed a series of &quot; outsider art &quot; paintings on Archbishop Romero, now exhibited in the permanent collection of the Organization of American States Museum, in Washington, D.C.; the permanent collection of the Art Museum of Southeast Texas, Beaumont, Texas; the Ella Noel Museum of Odessa, Texas; and the Maryknoll galleries in New York.

Wyn Painting the World Green: Dafydd Iwan and the Welsh Protest Ballad Folk Music Journal 8 5 594–618 2005 http://www.cf.ac.uk/insrv/libraries/scolar/digital/welshballads/painting.html ] The most famous reference to Romero&apos;s death in Spanish-language songs is &quot; El Padre Antonio y su Monaguillo Andrés &quot; ( &quot; Father Anthony and Acolyte Andrew &quot; ), written and sung by Panamanian Rubén Blades. This song describes the arrival in a Latin American country of an idealistic Spanish priest (a fictional representation of Archbishop Romero), his sermons condemning violence there, his talks about love and justice, and, finally, the murders of the priest and acolyte during a mass. Blades has said he wrote this song so that &quot; the death of Romero is not forgotten. &quot; In 1981, Brazilian classical composer Jorge Antunes wrote a choral-symphonic work entitled &quot; Elegia Violeta para Monsenhor Romero &quot; ( &quot; Violet Elegy for Monsignor Romero &quot; ) using texts from Che Guevara, Vassili Vassilikos, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Psalms, and Archbishop Romero himself as lyrics. The work finishes with the children&apos;s choir repeating, each time more strongly, &quot; ¡No se mata la justicia! &quot; ( &quot; Justice cannot be killed! &quot; : the very words in which Archbishop Romero replied to a Brazilian reporter&apos;s question whether the archbishop were afraid he&apos;d be killed because of his defense of the poor and his protest against the murders of priests)  – until their voices are muted by seemingly panicked, syncopated instrumental sounds. Brazilian Bishop Dom Pedro Casaldáliga immortalized Romero as &quot; San Romero de América &quot; ( &quot; Saint Romero of the Americas &quot; ) in a famous poem by that name written shortly after the archbishop&apos;s assassination. The poem, a variation on the Angelus, popularized the use of the phrase &quot; San Romero &quot; (instead of &quot; Saint Oscar &quot; ) throughout Latin America (and, for example, in Escalet&apos;s &quot; San Romero &quot; paintings or in the &quot; San Romero de América &quot; UCC Church in New York City). Welsh singer-songwriter Dafydd Iwan wrote about Romero&apos;s assassination in the song &quot; Oscar Romero &quot;. &quot; Eulogy For Oscar Romero &quot; is an instrumental piece composed and performed by Jean-Luc Ponty. &quot; The Marching Song of the Covert Battalions, &quot; the third track on Billy Bragg &apos;s 1990 album The Internationale, pays homage to Romero. Romero is mentioned in the song &quot; Same Thing &quot; by the American alternative hip hop band Flobots.
