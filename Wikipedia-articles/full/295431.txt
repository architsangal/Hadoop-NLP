King Street and Maynard Avenue S., is a popular gathering place in the International District. The Wing Luke Asian Museum is an important cultural institution in the neighborhood, as was the Nippon Kan Theatre until its recent closure. Kobe Terrace, on the steep slope between I-5 and S. Main Street, is another important site, where many neighborhood residents have urban gardens in the Danny Woo International District Community Garden. The district includes Uwajimaya Village, named after Uwajimaya; across Fifth Avenue from Uwajimaya Village is the Union Station office complex, built where abandoned Union Pacific Railroad tracks once ran. According to the 2000 census, [ 2011 7 17 ] the International District is 56% Asian, 15% black, 15% white, and 5% Hispanic/Latino. [ Location ] The neighborhood encompasses the blocks east of Fifth Avenue S., beyond which are Pioneer Square and SoDo; west of Boren and Rainier Avenues  S., beyond which is Rainier Valley; north of S.  Dearborn Street, beyond which are Beacon Hill and the Industrial District; and south of S.  Main Street, beyond which is Downtown and First Hill. The main thoroughfares in Chinatown are South Jackson Street and South King Street (east- and westbound); and the prominent thoroughfare in Little Saigon is 12th  Avenue South (north- and southbound) intersecting at South Jackson Street. The portion east of Interstate 5 and north of South Lane Street has been dubbed &quot; Little Saigon &quot; because of the high concentration of Vietnamese businesses there. [ History ] { Lion dance rs in the firecracker smoke. } [ 19th century ] Chinese immigrants first came to the Pacific Northwest in the 1850s, and by the 1860s some had settled in Seattle. The first Chinese quarters were near Yesler&apos;s Mill on the waterfront. In 1886 whites drove out Seattle&apos;s Chinese population and the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 further hindered the community. Eventually the Chinese established their new quarters further inland along Washington St.Japanese immigrants also began to arrive, settling in the south side of the district; the part of present-day Dearborn Street between 8th and 12th Streets was known as Mikado Street, after the Japanese word for &quot; emperor. &quot; [ Seattle man champions changing a century-old street name http://www.king5.com/news/Seattle-man-champions-changing-a-century-old-street-name-125704953.html July 17, 2011 KING-TV Owen Lei 2011-07-17 City ordinance 4044, enacted Dec. 23, 1895, changed Mikado to Dearborn as part of a city-wide plan to standardize street names in a booming urban area. Section 276 of the bill stated, &apos;That the names of Alaska Street, Mikado Street, Modjeska Street, Cullen Street, Florence Street and Duke Street, from Elliott Bay to Lake Washington, be and the same are changed to Dearborn Street.&apos; ] Japanese American s developed Nihonmachi, or Japantown, on Main Street, two blocks north of King Street. By the mid-1920s, Nihonmachi extended from 4th Avenue along Main to 7th Avenue, with clusters of businesses along Jackson, King, Weller, Lane, and Dearborn streets.

By the early 1900s a new Chinatown on King Street began to develop. In 1910 Goon Dip, a prominent businessman in Seattle&apos;s Chinese American community, [ http://www.wingluke.org/district.htm Seattle&apos;s Chinatown/International District Wing Luke Museum October 15, 2007 ] led a group of Chinese Americans to form the Kong Yick Investment Company, a benefit society. Their money and efforts led to the construction of two buildings —the East Kong Yick Building and the West Kong Yick Building —intended to serve as the anchor of a &quot; new &quot; Chinatown. [ July 2011 ] Meanwhile, Filipino American s settled some of the neighborhood&apos;s hotels and boarding houses beginning in the early 1900s, attracted by opportunities to work as contract laborers in agriculture and salmon canneries. { Cynthia Mejia-Giudici, Filipino Cannery Workers, HistoryLink Essay 411, HistoryLink, } [ 1998-12-03 ] {.

Authorities moved them to internment camps where they lived from 1942 to 1946. Most of Seattle&apos;s Japanese residents went to Minidoka in Idaho. { Japanese American Internment during World War II, Friends of Minidoka. Accessed } [ 2012-01-04 ] {. } After the war, many returned to the Pacific Northwest but relocated to the suburbs or other districts in Seattle. One remaining vestige of the old community is the office of the North American Post, a Japanese-language newspaper founded in 1902. African Americans moved to the district from across the country to work in the war industry during World War II, occupying many of the houses left vacant due to the interment of the Japanese. Many neighborhood buildings were destroyed for the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1960s. In the 1970s, organizations devoted to the preservation of the International District were founded, some in response to the 1975 construction of the Kingdome on land that was intended for use as low-income housing. The International Examiner, a community newspaper, was founded in the district in 1974. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, a new wave of immigrants from Southeast Asia established Seattle&apos;s Little Saigon in the district. Many of these immigrants were of Chinese descent.

In 1999, the City Council approved the &quot; Chinatown-International District Strategic Plan &quot; for the future of the neighborhood. Since then, the often conflicting interests of development and preservation have clashed as office developments (e.g., Union Station) and market-rate housing development (e.g., Uwajimaya Village) offer economic growth but threaten to change the character of the neighborhood and increase gentrification and rents. A debate over the vacation of S.  Lane Street as part of the Uwajimaya redevelopment is an example of this clash.
