The film stars Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery. The original film score was composed by Bernard Herrmann. [ Plot ] Marnie Edgar (Hedren) is a troubled young woman who has an unnatural fear and mistrust of men, thunderstorms, and the color red. She is also a thief. She uses her charms on Sidney Strutt ( Martin Gabel ) to get a job without references. Then late one night, she steals the contents of the company safe and disappears. Mark and Marnie on their honeymoon cruise Mark Rutland (Connery), a widower who owns a large publishing company, is a customer of Strutt&apos;s. He learns about the theft from the victim, and remembers the woman. Marnie applies for a job at his company; he hires her and they begin to date. He is robbed too, but he finds her. He has fallen in love with her, and instead of handing her over to the police, blackmails her into marrying him. After being hastily married, Mark and Marnie depart on a honeymoon cruise. He finds out about her frigidity. At first, he respects her wishes but later consumates their marriage against her will. (In certain syndicated broadcastings of the film, this scene is censored, making the sexual encounter more ambiguous.) The next morning she attempts suicide by drowning in the ship&apos;s swimming pool but he rescues her in time. Upon their return, Mark tries to discover the reason behind Marnie&apos;s behavior. In the end, they learn that her mother, Bernice ( Louise Latham ), had been a prostitute. When Marnie was six years old, one of Bernice&apos;s clients (a sailor played by Bruce Dern ) had tried to calm her after she became frightened by a storm. Bernice thought he was trying to molest her and began attacking him. Seeing her mother struggling with him, she struck him with a fireplace poker, killing him. The bloodshed led to her distrust of men and fear of the color red. Once the origin of her fears is revealed, she decides she wants to try to make her marriage work.

[ Responses ] The movie was not as successful in theatres as other Hitchcock productions, although it did turn a profit in the UK and Italy. [ February 2007 ] Leonard Maltin has argued that Marnie was ahead of its time, [ February 2007 ] while in his biography The Dark Side of Genius, Donald Spoto describes it as Hitchcock&apos;s last masterpiece. The film&apos;s special effects are often criticized as unconvincing, with critics noting such things as obvious matte painting s and back projection. [ February 2007 ] However, in a making-of documentary on the DVD, Robin Wood, author of Hitchcock&apos;s Films Revisited, argues that they can be defended if one notes the roots of the film in German Expressionism : [Hitchcock] worked in German studios at first, in the silent period. Very early on when he started making films, he saw Fritz Lang &apos;s German silent movies; he was enormously influenced by that, and Marnie is basically an expressionist film in many ways. Things like scarlet suffusions over the screen, back-projection and backdrops, artificial-looking thunderstormsâ€”these are expressionist devices and one has to accept them. If one doesn&apos;t accept them then one doesn&apos;t understand and can&apos;t possibly like Hitchcock. [ Production ] In 1961, Alfred Hitchcock offered the title role to Grace Kelly, by then Princess Grace of Monaco, and she agreed. However, the citizens of Monaco objected to her appearing in a film, especially as a sexually disturbed thief. Also, when Kelly married Prince Rainier in 1956, she had not fulfilled her contract with MGM, which could have prevented her from working for another studio. When Kelly turned down the film Hitchcock put it aside to work on The Birds (1963). After completing The Birds, Hitchcock returned to the Winston Graham adaptation, and the role of Marnie became a sought-after role in Hollywood. In his book Hitchcock and the Making of Marnie, Tony Lee Moral revealed that a studio executive at Paramount Pictures suggested actress Lee Remick to Hitchcock for the title role. Eva Marie Saint, star of Hitchcock&apos;s North by Northwest (1959), and Susan Hampshire unsuccessfully pursued the role. Hitchcock also considered two other actresses who were, like Hedren, under his personal contract, Vera Miles and Claire Griswold, wife of director/actor Sydney Pollack. Instead, Hitchcock opted to use Tippi Hedren, a one-time model he had seen in a commercial for a diet drink in 1961 then cast successfully in The Birds. According to Hedren, he offered her the role of Marnie during filming of The Birds. Hedren told writer Moral that she was &quot; amazed &quot; that Hitchcock would offer her this &quot; incredible role &quot;, calling it a &quot; once-in-a-lifetime opportunity &quot;. In 2005, more than 40 years after the film&apos;s release, Hedren declared in an interview that Marnie was her favorite of the two films she made with Hitchcock, because of the intriguing, complex, challenging character that she played.

When asked what he wanted to do, Connery replied that he wanted to work with Alfred Hitchcock, which Eon arranged through their contacts. { Broccoli, Albert R.; Zec, Donald. When the Snow Melts: The Autobiography of Cubby Broccoli. Trans-Atlantic Publications 1999 } Connery also shocked many people at the time by asking to see a script; some regarded that as an affront to Hitchcock. But Connery was worried about being typecast as a spy and he did not want to do a variation of North by Northwest or Notorious. When told by Hitchcock&apos;s agent that Cary Grant did not ask to see even one of Hitchcock&apos;s scripts Connery replied, &quot; I&apos;m not Cary Grant. &quot; [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C875552%2C00.html?promoid%3Dgooglep Canny Scot Time January 10, 1964 ] However, Hitchcock and Connery got on well during filming. Connery also said that he was happy with the film, &quot; with certain reservations. &quot; [ http://seanconneryonline.com/art_playboy1165.htm PLAYBOY INTERVIEW: SEAN CONNERY Playboy magazine November 1965 ] Marnie became a milestone for several reasons. It was the last time a &apos;Hitchcock blonde&apos; would have a central role in one of his films. It was also the final occasion when he would worked with several of his key team members, who had figured so prominently in his films: director of photography Robert Burks who died in 1968; editor George Tomasini, who died soon after Marnie&apos;s release; and music composer Bernard Herrmann, who was fired during Hitchcock&apos;s next film, Torn Curtain (1966), when Hitchcock and Universal studio executives wanted a more contemporary &apos;pop&apos; tune for the film. Also, Hitchcock had noticed a strong similarity between Herrmann&apos;s score for Joy in the Morning and Marnie and believed Herrmann was repeating himself. { Smith, Steven C. A Heart at Fire&apos;s Centre: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann. University of California Press, 1991, p.268 } Herrmann&apos;s music for Marnie included excerpts in his special album for Decca Records. Also, lyrics were written to Herrmann&apos;s theme that were to be sung by Nat King Cole. In a making-of documentary for the DVD release, unit manager Hilton A. Green explains that shooting had been scheduled to begin on November 25, 1963, but had to be postponed because the nation was in mourning for John F. Kennedy, who had been shot three days before. Marnie continues to have its admirers, as actress Catherine Deneuve indicated that she would have loved to have played Marnie.

His replacement Jay Presson Allen told him that the rape scene was the only reason Hitchcock wanted to make the film. { pp. 204-205 Gottlieb, Sidney &amp; Brookhouse, Christopher Evan Hunter Interview Framing Hitchcock: Selected Essays from the Hitchcock Annual Wayne State University Press } Although they played mother and daughter, Latham (42) was only eight years older than Hedren (34).
