In the 2010 census the population was 14, making it the second-smallest incorporated community in the State of Illinois in terms of population. [ American FactFinder http://factfinder2.census.gov/main.html U.S. Census Bureau 4 March 2011 ] A major French colonial town of the Illinois Country, its peak population was about 7,000 when it was a regional center in the 18th century. Kaskaskia then became the capital of the United States&apos; Illinois Territory, created on February 3, 1809. In 1818, when Illinois became the 21st U.S. state, it briefly served as the state&apos;s first capital until 1819, when the capitol moved to Vandalia. Most of the town was destroyed in April 1881 by flooding, as the Mississippi River shifted eastward to a new channel, taking over the lower [ 10 mi km ] of the Kaskaskia River. This resulted from deforestation of the river banks during the 19th century, due to the need for wood fuel to feed the steamboat traffic. The river now passes east rather than west of the town. The state boundary line, however, remained in its original location. Accordingly, if the Mississippi River is considered to be a break in physical continuity, Kaskaskia is an exclave of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and only reachable from Missouri. A bridge crosses the old riverbed, a creek that is sometimes filled with water, and sometimes not. Kaskaskia has Missouri telephone area code and a Missouri zip code. Its roads, however, are maintained by IDOT and its few residents vote in the Illinois elections. [ History ] { Griggsville, Illinois. } The town was named after the Native American word for the Kaskaskia River. At first favorably situated on a peninsula, the town was cut off and mostly destroyed by repeated flooding and a channel change by the Mississippi River. The site of Kaskaskia near the river was first a Native American village, inhabited by varying indigenous peoples for thousands of years. In 1703 French Jesuit missionaries established a mission with the goal of converting the Illini Native Americans to Catholicism. The congregation built its first stone church in 1714. The French also had a trading post in the fur trade at the village. { http://www.nps.gov/archTheBicentennial/Symposium2001/Papers/Faherty_FrWilliam. Htm, accessed, April 14, 2010 } French settlers moved in to farm and to exploit the lead mines on the Missouri side of the river. Kaskaskia became the capital of Upper Louisiana and the French built Fort de Chartres in 1718. In the same year they imported the first enslaved Africans, shipped from Santo Domingo, to work as laborers in the lead mines being developed in Missouri. { http://www.kansasgenealogy.com/history/du_tisne.htm, accessed April 14, 2010 } From its beginning, Kaskaskia was a French/Indian settlement, consisting of a few French men and numerous Illinois and other American Indians. In 1707, the population of the community was estimated at 2,200, the majority Illinois who lived somewhat apart from the Europeans. Writing of Kaskaskia about 1715, a visitor said that the village consisted of 400 Illinois men, &quot; good people, &quot; two Jesuit missionaries, and &quot; about twenty French voyageurs who have settled there and married Indian women. &quot; { Norall, Frank. Bourgmont, Explorer of the Missouri, 1698-1725. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1988. p. 107 } Of twenty-one children whose birth and baptism was recorded in Kaskaskia before 1714, eighteen mothers were Indian and twenty fathers were French. One devout Catholic full-blooded Indian woman disowned her half-breed son for living &quot; among the savage nations. &quot; { Ekberg, Carl J. French Roots in the Illinois Country: The Mississippi Frontier in Colonial Times, Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2000. p. 153-154 } From the French, the Indians, and the mixed-race descendants at Kaskaskia came the voyageurs and coureurs des bois, who would explore and exploit the Missouri River country. The French had the goal of trading with all the Prairie tribes, and beyond with the Spanish colony in New Mexico — a prospect which horrified the Spanish. French goals stimulated the expedition of Claude Charles Du Tisne to establish trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719. King Louis XV sent a bell to Kaskaskia in 1741 for its church, one of several constructed there. { &quot; Visitors&apos; Guide: Immaculate Conception Church &quot;, Great River Road, accessed November 9, 2009 } During the years of French rule, Kaskaskia and the other agricultural settlements in the Illinois Country were important for supplying Lower Louisiana, especially New Orleans, with wheat and corn. Farmers shipped tons of flour south over the years, as those staple crops could not be grown in Louisiana&apos;s climate. In 1733 the French built Fort Kaskaskia near this site. It was destroyed by the British in 1763 during the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years War ), which they won. Rather than live under British rule after France ceded the territory east of the river, many French-speaking people from Kaskaskia and other colonial towns moved west of the Mississippi to Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis, and other areas. The city fell on July 4, 1778 to George Rogers Clark and his force of 200 men including Captain Leonard Helm during one of the western most battles of the American Revolution. The parish rang the church bell in celebration, which has since been called the &quot; liberty bell &quot;. It is housed in a brick building shrine near the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The brick church was built in 1843 in the squared-off French style. As a center of the regional economy, Kaskaskia served as the capital of Illinois Territory from 1809 until statehood was gained in 1818, and then as state capital until 1819. Its peak population was about 7,000 before the capital moved in 1819 to Vandalia. Although introduction of steamboats on the Mississippi River stimulated the economies of river towns in the 19th century, their use also had devastating environmental effects. Deforestation of the banks followed steamboat crews&apos; regular cutting of trees to feed the engine fires. River banks became unstable and collapsed into the water. From St. Louis to the confluence of the Ohio River, the Mississippi became wider and more shallow, with more severe flooding. Much of Kaskaskia and other French colonial towns has been lost. { F. Terry Norris, &quot; Where Did the Villages Go? Steamboats, Deforestation, and Archaeological Loss in the Mississippi Valley &quot;, in Common Fields: an environmental history of St. Louis, Andrew Hurley, ed., St. Louis, MO: Missouri Historical Society Press, 1997, pp. 73-89 } Following the Great Flood of 1844, Kaskaskia relocated to the south. The original location of Kaskaskia became an island, surrounded by the Mississippi River. The flood of 1881 destroyed all remnants of the original town and the Mississippi shifted into the channel of the Kaskaskia River, passing east instead of west of the town. Parts of the town were rebuilt in the new area. As the Mississippi continued to flow through its new bed, earth was deposited so that the village became physically attached to the west bank of the river, which primarily lies within the boundaries of the state of Missouri. Now a bayou, the old channel is regularly flooded and has a bridge to carry traffic over it. In 1893 the people of the town moved and rebuilt the Church of the Immaculate Conception on Kaskaskia Island. By 1950 only 112 people lived in Kaskaskia. By 1970 the population had fallen to 79, and it continued its precipitous decline to 33 in 1980. The town was submerged under nine feet of water by the Great Flood of 1993, which reached the roofs of the buildings. By 2000, with a mere nine residents, Kaskaskia was almost a ghost town and the least populous incorporated community in the State of Illinois.
