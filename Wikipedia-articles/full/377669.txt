Suddenly, from a thicket, jumped the most beautiful deer they had ever seen. Immediately they started in pursuit. Over mountain sides, through valleys and forests, across rivers, they followed the magnificent animal, until, with darkness, they lost track of it. There was nothing for them to do except make camp right where they were and await the coming of morning. When they awoke the next morning, a gorgeous sight greeted their eyes. In their wild ride, they had crossed the borders of their own country and had arrived in another of which they had never heard, a country richly endowed with good soil, beautiful forest, fruits, flowers, game and fish. Hunor and Magyar, decided that this was the land of their choice. They went back for their father&apos;s blessing and then returned with their wives to their new rich country. Through the ages they prospered. The descendants of Hunor became the Huns and of Magor, the Magyars, who now form the Hungarian nation. ] Baden-Powell also referred to the symbol of the Hungarian people in his farewell address to the assembled Scouts: [ http://www.pinetreeweb.com/1933-wj4-news47.htm Au Revoir &quot; — Not Goodbye!

In 1994, after democracy and Scouting was reestablished in Hungary, the community around Gödöllő moved to locate and re-erect the statue. After a long search, the original statue could not be found, and a committee was established with the purpose of erecting a new statue.
