[ 1958 10 26 y ] { Bristol, England } { Labour (1999–present) } { Conservative (Before 1999) } { Jesus College, Cambridge } { Harvard University } { Anglicanism House of Commons Hansard Debates for 25 Jan 1999 (pt 13) } Shaun Anthony Woodward (born 26 October 1958) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for St Helens South since 2001. He served in the Cabinet from 28 June 2007 to 11 May 2010 as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Woodward was the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland until 7 October 2011, when he was replaced by Vernon Coaker. A former television researcher and producer, Woodward began his political career in the Conservative Party. He was elected in 1997 as a Conservative MP for Witney, but joined Labour in 1999. [ Early life ] Woodward was educated at the independent Bristol Grammar School, Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied English Literature, and Harvard University as a Kennedy Scholar. From 1981–2, he was Parliamentary Lobbyist for the National Consumer Council. From 1982–90, he worked as a researcher and producer for BBC TV News and Current Affairs on the programmes That&apos;s Life!, Panorama and Newsnight. He subsequently wrote a book about Ben Hardwick. From 1991–2, he was Director of Communications for the Conservative Party. [ Member of Parliament ] He was selected as Douglas Hurd &apos;s successor as Conservative candidate for the safe seat of Witney at the 1997 election, having previously been a senior official of the party. Elected with a large majority, he was a front-bench spokesman on London for the Conservative opposition under William Hague until 1999, when he was sacked for supporting the repeal of Section 28, [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/548341.stm Tories split over gay rights sacking 2008-12-03 1999-12-03 BBC News ] a regulation which prevented the promotion of homosexuality in schools. [ Defection to the Labour Party ] After being sacked from the Tory frontbench, Woodward then controversially left the Conservative party to move to the ruling Labour Party, where he was given a job co-ordinating the Labour party&apos;s 2001 general election campaign.

Woodward refused to hold a by-election, and continued to represent his constituency for two years, despite criticism from colleagues in his own party, including Tony Benn, Jeremy Corbyn and Chris Mullin, who would later write that Woodward&apos;s decision to change his political affiliation without consulting his electorate &quot; discredits the political process &quot;.

His successor in Witney was David Cameron, who subsequently became Prime Minister in 2010. In his acclaimed diaries, Chris Mullin, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the DETR, wrote with shock of &quot; the awful Shaun Woodward &quot; defecting to his own side, calling &quot; the New Labour elite parachuting [Woodward] into a safe seat... one of New Labour&apos;s vilest stitch-ups... made my flesh creep &quot;. Mullin had previously accused Woodward of using the Ladbroke Grove rail crash &quot; to score cheap political points &quot;. When news of Woodward&apos;s intention to stand reached St. Helens, a strong left-wing challenge was put forward in an attempt to deny the former Conservative the safe Labour seat. Neil Thompson of the Socialist Alliance and Michael Perry of the Socialist Labour Party both contested the St Helens South seat and received a total of 12% of the vote between them. Woodward won the seat with a much reduced 49% of the vote. [ http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0%2C9338%2C-1326%2C00.html The Guardian London 23 May 2010 Politics ] As a Labour MP, Woodward served on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and was a prominent supporter of the Gender Recognition Act 2004. In May 2005, Woodward was re-elected in St Helens South receiving 54% of the vote and his majority increased. However, the Liberal Democrats candidate, Brian Spencer, saw his party&apos;s vote increase from 23% in 2001 to 28%. Michael Perry of the Socialist Labour Party contested the seat again and received just under two percent of the vote. [ In government ] After the 2005 election he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office. In the May 2006 reshuffle, Tony Blair named Woodward Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with responsibilities for the digital handover for TV. On 28 June 2007, in his first cabinet, newly appointed Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Woodward as the Northern Ireland Secretary, replacing Peter Hain. Woodward chose not to receive a Ministerial salary because of his personal wealth. As Northern Ireland Secretary, Woodward reportedly became a close confidant of the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. This was largely due to Woodward&apos;s previous first hand experiences of the beleaguered Conservative government of John Major.

Nevertheless, he was retained as Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland by Labour leader Ed Miliband for just under a year.

They have one son (Thomas, born July 1989) and three daughters (Eleanor, born May 1991, Olivia, born October 1993, and Katherine, born September 1996).
