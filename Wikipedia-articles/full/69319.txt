It is the eighth largest island in the world, and at [ 217291 km2 on 0 ] [ 1 1 ] is Canada&apos;s second largest island. It is nearly double the size of Newfoundland ( [ 111390 km2 on 0 ] ), and is slightly larger than the island of Great Britain ( [ 209331 km2 on 0 ] ). The western third of the island belongs to the Inuvik Region in the Northwest Territories; the remainder is part of Nunavut&apos;s Kitikmeot Region. It should not be confused with the smaller Vancouver Island, which is home to Victoria, British Columbia, the capital of that Canadian province.

On the west are Amundsen Gulf [ map4 map4 ] and Banks Island, [ map5 map5 ] which is separated from Victoria by a long sound called the Prince of Wales Strait. [ map6 map6 ] To the south (from west to east) lies the Dolphin and Union Strait, [ map7 map7 ] Austin Bay, [ map8 map8 ] Coronation Gulf [ map9 map9 ] and the Dease Strait. [ map10 map10 ] The southern waterways, and sometimes the Prince of Wales Strait, form part of the disputed Northwest Passage which the Government of Canada claims are Canadian Internal Waters, while other nations state they are either territorial waters or international waters. Victoria Island is an island of peninsula s, having a heavily indented coastline with many inlet s. In the east, pointing northwards, is the Storkerson Peninsula, [ map11 map11 ] which ends with the Goldsmith Channel, [ map12 map12 ] the body of water separating Victoria from Stefansson Island. [ map13 map13 ] The Storkerson Peninsula is separated from the island&apos;s north-central areas by Hadley Bay, [ map14 map14 ] a major inlet. Another, broad peninsula is found in the north, Prince Albert Peninsula. [ map15 map15 ] This ends at the Prince of Wales Strait. In the south, and pointing westwards, is the Wollaston Peninsula, [ map16 map16 ] separated from the island&apos;s central areas by Prince Albert Sound. The island as a whole coincidentally resembles a stylized maple leaf, the main Canadian symbol. Closeup map of Victoria Island The highest point of Victoria Island is [ 655 m on ] in the Shaler Mountains [ map17 map17 ] in the north-central region. Located in the southeast, just north of Cambridge Bay is Ferguson Lake [ map18 map18 ] with an area of [ 562 km2 on ] is the largest lake on the island. { Ferguson Lake at the Atlas of Canada } In the Canada 2006 Census the population of the island was 1,875; 1,477 in Nunavut and 398 in the Northwest Territories. Of the two settlements on the island the largest is Cambridge Bay, [ map19 map19 ] which lies on the south-east coast and is in Nunavut. Ulukhaktok [ map20 map20 ] is on the west coast and is in the Northwest Territories. Trading post s, such as Fort Collinson [ map21 map21 ] on the northwest coast, have long since been abandoned. The island is named after Queen Victoria, the Canadian sovereign from 1867 to 1901. The features bearing the name &quot; Prince Albert &quot; are named after her consort. While Victoria Island is part of Canada, it is over [ 2000 km on ] from the city of Victoria, British Columbia, which is on Vancouver Island in the Pacific Ocean. There is also a smaller Victoria Island in Nunavut, located in Amadjuak Lake on Baffin Island. { Victoria Island, Amadjuak Lake at the Atlas of Canada } [ Notes ] [ 1 1 ] [ 220548 km2 on ] [ 217291 km2 on ] The United Nations Environment Programme says that Victoria Island has an area of.
