In addition to composing the songs for The Wizard of Oz, including the classic 1938 song, &quot; Over the Rainbow,” Arlen is a highly regarded contributor to the Great American Songbook. &quot; Over the Rainbow, &quot; in fact, was voted the twentieth century&apos;s No. 1 song by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). { http://www.haroldarlen.com/honors.html; “New Song List Puts &apos;Rainbow&apos; Way Up High.” CNN.com/Entertainment (http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/07/365.songs/index.html). Accessed Aug. 26, 2009. } [ Biography ] Arlen was born Hyman Arluck, in Buffalo, New York, the child of a Jewish cantor. His twin brother died the next day. He learned the piano as a youth and formed a band as a young man. He achieved some local success as a pianist and singer and moved to New York City in his early 20s. He worked as an accompanist in vaudeville. { Laurie, Joe, Jr. Vaudeville: From the Honky-tonks to the Palace. New York: Henry Holt, 1953. p. 328. } At this point, he changed his name to Harold Arlen. Between 1926 and about 1934, Arlen appeared occasionally as a band vocalist on records by The Buffalodians, Red Nichols, Joe Venuti, Leo Reisman and Eddie Duchin, usually singing his own compositions. In 1929, Arlen composed his first well-known song: &quot; Get Happy &quot; (with lyrics by Ted Koehler ). Throughout the early and mid-1930s, Arlen and Koehler wrote shows for the Cotton Club, a popular Harlem night club, as well as for Broadway musicals and Hollywood films. Arlen and Koehler&apos;s partnership resulted in a number of hit songs, including the familiar standards &quot; Let&apos;s Fall in Love &quot; and &quot; Stormy Weather. &quot; Arlen continued to perform as a pianist and vocalist with some success, most notably on records with Leo Reisman&apos;s society dance orchestra. Arlen&apos;s compositions have always been popular with jazz musicians because of his facility at incorporating a blues feeling into the idiom of the conventional American popular song. In the mid-1930s, Arlen married, and spent increasing time in California, writing for movie musicals. It was at this time that he began working with lyricist E.Y. &quot; Yip &quot; Harburg. In 1938, the team was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to compose songs for The Wizard of Oz. The most famous of these is the song &quot; Over the Rainbow &quot; for which they won the Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song. They also wrote &quot; Down with Love &quot; (featured in the 1937 Broadway show, Hooray for What! ), a song later featured in the 2003 movie Down with Love. Arlen was a longtime friend and former roommate of actor Ray Bolger who would star in The Wizard of Oz, the film for which &quot; Over the Rainbow &quot; was written. In the 1940s, he teamed up with lyricist Johnny Mercer, and continued to write hit songs like &quot; Blues in the Night &quot;, &quot; That Old Black Magic, &quot; &quot; Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive, &quot; &quot; Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home &quot; and &quot; One for My Baby (and One More for the Road) &quot;. Arlen composed two defining tunes which bookend Judy Garland &apos;s musical persona: as a yearning, innocent girl in &quot; Over the Rainbow &quot; and a world-weary, &quot; chic chanteuse &quot; with &quot; The Man that Got Away &quot;, the latter written for the 1954 version of the movie &apos;A Star Is Born&apos;.
