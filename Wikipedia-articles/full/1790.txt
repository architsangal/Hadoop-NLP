[ Alexander Selkirk Alexander Selkirk Statue.jpg Statue of Alexander Selkirk in Lower Largo Statue of Alexander Selkirk in Lower Largo 1676 13 December 1721 Scotland and Great Britain after 1707 Inspiring Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver&apos;s Travels Sailor ] An 1835 book inspired by Selkirk&apos;s life Alexander Selkirk (1676 – 13 December 1721) was a Scottish sailor who spent four years as a castaway after being marooned on an uninhabited island. An unruly youth, Selkirk joined several buccaneering expeditions to the South Seas, including one commanded by William Dampier, which called in for provisions at the Juan Fernández Islands off Chile. Selkirk judged correctly that his craft, the Cinque Ports, was unseaworthy, and was given the choice of being left ashore on his own. He was eventually rescued by Dampier after four years, in which he had developed hunting and woodcraft skills to a high degree. Selkirk&apos;s story aroused great interest at home, and Daniel Defoe &apos;s fictional character Robinson Crusoe was almost certainly based in part on him. [ Early life ] The son of a shoemaker and tanner in Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland, Selkirk was born in 1676. In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition. Summoned on 27 August 1695 before the Kirk Session for his &quot; undecent carriage &quot; (indecent behaviour) in church, he &quot; did not comper [appear], having gone away to be [the] seas: this business is continued till his return &quot;. At an early period he was engaged in buccaneer expeditions to the South Seas and in 1703 joined the expedition of famed privateer and explorer William Dampier. While Dampier was captain of the St. George, Selkirk served on the galley Cinque Ports, the St. George s companion, as a sailing master serving under Thomas Stradling. [ Castaway ] [ January 2012 ] In October 1704, after the ships had parted ways because of a dispute between Stradling and Dampier, the Cinque Ports was brought by Stradling to an island that is today known as Robinson Crusoe Island in the uninhabited archipelago of Juan Fernández off the coast of Chile for a mid-expedition restocking of supplies and fresh water. By this time, Selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of this vessel. He tried to persuade some of his crewmates to desert with him, remaining on the island; he was counting on an impending visit by another ship. No one else agreed to come along with him. Stradling declared that he would grant him his wish and leave him alone on Juan Fernández. Selkirk promptly regretted his decision. He chased and called after the boat, to no avail. Selkirk lived the next four years and four months without any human company. The Cinque Ports did indeed later founder off the coast of what is present-day Colombia. Stradling and half a dozen of the crew survived the loss of their ship, but were made prisoners by the Spanish, as the War of the Spanish Succession was going on (England and the Netherlands were in conflict with France and Spain over who was to be King of Spain). They were sent to Lima in Peru where they endured a harsh imprisonment. [ Life on the island ] { Juan Fernández Islands } { archipelago } Hearing strange sounds from inland, which he feared were dangerous beasts, Selkirk remained at first along the shoreline. During this time he ate shellfish, and scanned the ocean daily for rescue, suffering all the while from loneliness, misery and remorse. Hordes of raucous sea lion s, gathering on the beach for the mating season, eventually drove him to the island&apos;s interior. Once there, his way of life took a turn for the better. More foods were now available: feral goat s – introduced by earlier sailors – provided him with meat and milk and wild turnips, cabbage, and black pepper berries offered him variety and spice. Although rat s would attack him at night, he was able, by domesticating and living near feral cat s, to sleep soundly and in safety. Selkirk proved resourceful in using equipment from the ship as well as materials that were native to the island. He built two huts [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7703375.stm BBC News Dig finds camp of &apos;real Crusoe&apos; 1 November 2008 Richard Lloyd Parry ] out of pimento tree s. He used his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses. As his gunpowder dwindled, he had to chase prey on foot. During one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff, lying unconscious for about a day. (His prey had cushioned his fall, sparing him a broken back.) { Rodgers, Woodes, Providence display’d, or a very surprising account of one, p. 6. } He read from the Bible frequently, finding it a comfort to him in his condition and a mainstay for his English. When Selkirk&apos;s clothes wore out, he made new garments from goatskin using a nail for sewing. The lessons he had learned as a child from his father, a tanner, helped him greatly during his stay on the island. As his shoes became unusable, he had no need to make new ones, since his toughened, callused feet made protection unnecessary. He forged a new knife out of barrel rings left on the beach. Two vessels had arrived and departed before his escape, but both were Spanish. As a Scotsman and privateer, he risked a terrible fate if captured and therefore he hid himself. At one point, his Spanish pursuers urinated at the bottom of a tree he was hiding in, but did not discover him. { Rodgers, Woodes, A Cruising Voyage round the World Diary entry for Feb 2nd } [ Rescue ] His long-anticipated rescue occurred on 1 February 1709 by way of the Duke, a privateering ship piloted by William Dampier. Selkirk was discovered by the Duke s captain, Woodes Rogers, who referred to him as Governor of the island. Now rescued, he was almost incoherent in his joy. The agile Selkirk, catching two or three goats a day, helped restore the health of Rogers&apos; men, who were suffering from scurvy. Rogers eventually made Selkirk his mate, giving him independent command of one of his ships. Rogers&apos; A cruising voyage round the world: first to the South-Sea, thence to the East-Indies, and homewards by the Cape of Good Hope was published in 1712 and included an account of Selkirk&apos;s ordeal. [ Later life ] Journalist Richard Steele interviewed Selkirk about his adventures and wrote a much-read article about him in The Englishman. { Article, dated 1 December 1713. } Early in 1717 Selkirk returned to Lower Largo but stayed only a few months. There he met Sophia Bruce, a sixteen-year-old dairymaid. They eloped to London but apparently did not marry. In March 1717 he again went off to sea. While on a visit to Plymouth, he married a widowed innkeeper. According to the ship&apos;s log, Selkirk died at 8 p.m. on 13 December 1721 while serving as a lieutenant on board the Royal ship Weymouth. He probably succumbed to the yellow fever that had devastated the voyage. He was buried at sea off the west coast of Africa. Several people who spoke to Selkirk after his rescue (such as Captain Rogers and the journalist Steele) were impressed by the tranquillity of mind and vigour of the body that Selkirk had attained while on the island. Rogers stated that &quot; one may see that Solitude and Retirement from the World is not such an unsufferable State of Life as most Men imagine, especially when People are fairly call&apos;d or thrown into it unavoidably, as this Man was &quot;. Steele noted that &quot; This plain Man&apos;s Story is a memorable Example, that he is happiest who confines his Wants to natural Necessities; and he that goes further in his Desires, increases his Wants in Proportion to his Acquisitions &quot;. [ Commemoration ] In 1863, the crew of [ Topaze 1858 6 ] placed a bronze tablet on a spot called Selkirk&apos;s Lookout on a hill of the island in memory of his stay. { Kraske (2005), p.100 } On 1 January 1966 Selkirk&apos;s island was officially renamed Robinson Crusoe Island. At the same time, the most western island of the Juan Fernández Islands was renamed Alejandro Selkirk Island although Selkirk probably never saw that island (97 miles west). On 11 December 1885, after a speech by Lord Aberdeen, Lady Aberdeen unveiled a bronze statue and plaque of Alexander Selkirk outside a house on the site of Selkirk&apos;s original home on the Main Street of Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland. David Gillies of Cardy House, Lower Largo, a descendant of the Selkirks, donated the statue and T. Stuart Burnett ARAS designed it. { Notable Dates in History by Scots Independent } { Lower Largo, Scotland. } [ Archaeological findings ] Around 2000, an expedition led by the Japanese Daisuke Takahashi, searching for Selkirk&apos;s camp on the island ( Robinson Crusoe Island ), found part of an early eighteenth (or late seventeenth) century nautical instrument that almost certainly belonged to Selkirk.

[ In other literary works ] [ the original text of William Cowper&apos;s The Solitude of Alexander Selkirk ] William Cowper &apos;s The Solitude Of Alexander Selkirk is about the feelings of Alexander Selkirk as he lived all alone on the island. This poem gave rise to the common phrase monarch of all I survey via the verse: I am monarch of all I survey,My right there is none to dispute;From the centre all round to the sea,I am lord of the fowl and the brute. Charles Dickens used Selkirk as a simile in Chapter Two of The Pickwick Papers : &quot; Colonel Builder and Sir Thomas Clubber exchanged snuff–boxes, and looked very much like a pair of Alexander Selkirks — &apos;Monarchs of all they surveyed.&apos; &quot; This probably refers to William Cowper &apos;s poem. In his poem &quot; Inniskeen Road: July Evening &quot;, the poet Patrick Kavanagh likens his loneliness on the road to that of Selkirk: Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plightOf being king and government and nation.A road, a mile of kingdom, I am kingOf banks and stones and every blooming thing. In Etiquette, one of W.S. Gilbert &apos;s Bab Ballads, Selkirk is used as a model for the English castaways: These passengers, by reason of their clinging to a mast,Upon a desert island were eventually cast.They hunted for their meals, as Alexander Selkirk used,But they couldn’t chat together – they had not been introduced. Selkirk is mentioned in Sailing Alone Around The World by Joshua Slocum. During his stay on the Juan Fernández Islands, Slocum runs across a marker commemorating Selkirk&apos;s stay. In Allan Cole and Chris Bunch &apos;s Sten science fiction series, Book Two, The Wolf Worlds, the Scottish character Alex bemoans their predicament after crash landing; &apos;A slackit way f&apos;r a mon,&apos; Alex mourned to himself. &apos;Ah dinnae ken Ah&apos;d ever be Alex Selkirk.&apos; [ Film ] A stop motion film by Tournier Animation based on Alexander Selkirk&apos;s life was premiered simultaneously in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay on February 2, 2012. { Selkir, el verdadero Robinson Crusoe (2011) } [ Notes ] [ References ] Selcraig, B.
