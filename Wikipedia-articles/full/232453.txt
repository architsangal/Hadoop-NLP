In 2011 it had a 1.1% share of the UK beer market. { Alcoholic Drinks: Euromonitor from trade sources/national statistics } [ Company history ] In 1834 John Marston established J. Marston &amp; Son at the Horninglow Brewery at Burton upon Trent. Marston &amp; Son Ltd amalgamated with John Thompson &amp; Son Ltd and moved to Albion Brewery, where the company still operates. { Marston&apos;s: Burton-Upon-Trent Brewery } Banks &amp; Co has been brewing at the Park Brewery since 1875. { Marston&apos;s: Banks&apos;s } The Company was formed in 1890 as Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries by the amalgamation of Banks &amp; Co. with George Thompson &amp; Sons and Charles Colonel Smith&apos;s Brewery. { Marston&apos;s History &amp; Heritage } It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1947. It acquired Camerons Brewery in Hartlepool in 1992 and sold it to Castle Eden in 2002, whilst retaining some of Cameron&apos;s tied pubs. { End of an era at Castle Eden Northern Echo, 15 July 2002 } In 1999 the Company purchased Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed of Burton upon Trent (including Marston&apos;s Brewery which had been founded in 1834). Also in 1999 the Company purchased the Mansfield Brewery Company of Mansfield which, in contrast to its other recent acquisitions, was soon closed down. Brands still bearing the Mansfield name are brewed elsewhere in the group. In 2005 Marston&apos;s Brewery took over production under licence from Interbrew of Draught Bass, succeeding Coors. Later, in 2005, the Jennings Brewery of Cockermouth was also purchased and in 2007 Hampshire based Ringwood Brewery, which was established in 1978, and brews Best Bitter, Fortyniner, and Old Thumper, was acquired. { CAMRA fears “domino effect” following purchase of Ringwood by Marston&apos;s } In 2007 the Company changed its name from Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries plc to Marston&apos;s plc. { Marston&apos;s: Change of Name } [ Operations ] The company now owns and operates five breweries : the Park Brewery in Wolverhampton brews Banks&apos;s, Hanson&apos;s and Mansfield beers; the Marston&apos;s Brewery in Burton upon Trent brews Marston&apos;s and Bass; the Jennings Brewery in Cockermouth; { Marston&apos;s: About us } the Wychwood Brewery in Witney (which includes the Brakspear Brewhouse); and the Ringwood Brewery in Hampshire. The company also operate around 2,150 pubs and bars situated across England and Wales, comprising around 1,650 tenanted or leased pubs and around 500 managed pubs – of which 40 are hotels. { Marston&apos;s: Our pubs } [ Brewing methods ] Marston&apos;s Brewery makes use of water from the famous Burton Well, { Marston&apos;s brands } reputedly discovered by Benedictine monk s in the 13th century. Marston&apos;s is also the only remaining brewer to use Burton Union Sets; a system whereby fermentation barrels and troughs are linked together by a complex system of copper and brass pipework. The basic principle is one of preventing excessive beer and yeast loss through foaming, but the consequence is that the beer is both in contact with more wood and in contact with more beer (fermenting in a bigger volume). This results in a vastly more consistent flavour; and very little chance of a whole batch being ruined. All other large-scale brewers have abandoned this method in favour of stainless steel vats, which while they assure (through volume) a consistent flavour, do not permit the use of traditional yeast varieties. They also make selective use of the unusual double dropping process which introduces complex flavors due to a period of accelerated yeast growth. { Burton Union sets } [ Beers ] Bottle of Marston&apos;s Oyster Stout The current range is as follows: { Marstons: our brands } Banks&apos;s Mild (cask, bottle and can) Banks&apos;s Mild Smooth (keg and can) Banks&apos;s Bitter (cask, bottle, keg and can) Brakspear Bitter (cask, bottle) Brakspear Oxford Gold (cask, bottle) Brakspear Triple (keg, bottle) Brakspear EPA (keg) Jennings Cumberland Ale (cask and bottle) Jennings Bitter (cask and bottle) Jennings Cocker Hoop (cask and bottle) Jennings Dark Mild (cask) Jennings Cumberland Cream (keg) Jennings Smooth Bitter (keg) Jennings Sneck Lifter (cask and bottle) Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale (keg) Mansfield Original Bitter (keg) Mansfield Cask Ale (cask) Mansfield Dark Smooth Ale (keg) Mansfield Dark Mild (keg) Marston&apos;s Burton Bitter (cask and bottle) Marston&apos;s Old Empire (cask and bottle) Marston&apos;s Pedigree (cask, bottle and can) Marston&apos;s Smooth (keg) Marston&apos;s Resolution (bottle) Marston&apos;s Oyster Stout (keg and bottle) Ringwood Best Bitter (cask) Ringwood Fortyniner (cask) Ringwood Old Thumper (cask) Wychwood Hobgoblin (cask, bottle, can) Wychwood BeWyched Wychwood Wychcraft Wychwood Goliath Wychwood Circlemaster Wychwood Fiddler&apos;s Elbow Wychwood Black Wych Marston&apos;s also brews Draught Bass for A-B InBev and Tetley&apos;s Bitter, Mild and Dark Mild for Carlsberg { CAMRA Good Beer Guide; 2010 } [ Marston&apos;s Pedigree ] Marston&apos;s Pedigree is a bitter; it is Marston&apos;s flagship brand, selling 150,000 hectolitres in 2010. { Alcoholic Drinks: Euromonitor from trade sources/national statistics } It is the only beer to use the oak Burton Union System so that it is fermented in wood; the ingredients are mineral enriched Burton Water, Maris Otter barley, and Fuggles and Goldings hops.
