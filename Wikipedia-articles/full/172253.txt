Voigt eventually went on to head the Mathematical Physics Department at Göttingen and was succeeded in 1914 by Peter Debye, who took charge of the theoretical department of the Physical Institute. In 1921, Debye was succeeded by Max Born. Voigt was born in Leipzig, and died in Göttingen. He was a student of Franz Ernst Neumann. He worked on crystal physics, thermodynamics and electro-optics. His main work was the Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik (textbook on crystal physics), first published in 1910. He discovered the Voigt effect in 1898. The word tensor in its current meaning was introduced by him in 1899. Voigt profile and Voigt notation are named after him. He was also an amateur musician and became known as a Bach expert (see External links). In 1887 Voigt formulated a form of the Lorentz transformation between a rest frame of reference and a frame moving with speed v in the x direction. However, as Voigt himself declared, the transformation was aimed for a specific problem and did not carry with it the ideas of a general coordinate transformation, as is the case in relativity theory. [ Voigt, W. 1887a Göttinger Nachrichten On the Principle of Doppler 41–51 7 ] {; Reprinted with additional comments by Voigt in Physikalische Zeitschrift XVI, 381 - 386 (1915). } [ The Voigt transformation ] [ History of Lorentz transformations ] In modern notation Voigt&apos;s transformation was x^\prime = x - vt y^\prime = y/\gamma z^\prime = z/\gamma t^\prime = t - vx/c^2 where \gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}.If the right-hand sides of his equations are multiplied by \gamma they are the modern Lorentz transformation. Hermann Minkowski said in 1908 that the transformations which play the main role in the principle of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Also Hendrik Lorentz (1909) is on record as saying he could have taken these transformations into his theory of electrodynamics, if only he had known of them, rather than developing his own. It is interesting then to examine the consequences of these transformations from this point of view. Lorentz might then have seen that the transformation introduced relativity of simultaneity, and also time dilation. However, the magnitude of the dilation was greater than the now accepted value in the Lorentz transformations. Moving clocks, obeying Voigt&apos;s time transformation, indicate an elapsed time \Delta t_\mathrm{Voigt} = \gamma^{-2}\Delta t = \gamma^{-1}\Delta t_\mathrm{Lorentz},while stationary clocks indicate an elapsed time \Delta t. Lorentz did not adopt this transformation as he found in 1904 that only the Lorentz contraction corresponds to the principle of relativity. Since Voigt&apos;s transformation preserves the speed of light in all frames, the Michelson-Morley experiment and the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment can not distinguish between the two transformations. The crucial question is the issue of time dilation. The experimental measurement of time dilation by Ives and Stillwell (1938) and others settled the issue in favor of the Lorentz transformation.

The article contains on p.  235, last paragraph, and on p.  236, 2nd paragraph, a judgment on the Michelson experiment of 1886, which Voigt, after a correspondence with H. A. Lorentz in 1887 and 1888, has partly withdrawn in the article announced, namely in a footnote in Voigt (1888). According to Voigt&apos;s first judgment, the Michelson experiment must yield a null result, independently of whether the Earth transp orts the luminiferous aether with it (Fizeau&apos;s 1st aether hypothesis), or whether the Earth moves through an entirely independent, self-consistent universal luminiferous aether (Fizeau&apos;s 2nd aether hypothesis). [ Voigt, W. 1888 Annalen der Physik Theorie des Lichts für bewegte Medien 370–396, 524–551 35 ]; In a footnote on p.  390 of this article, Voigt corrects his earlier judgment, made in Göttinger Nachrichten No. 8, p.  235 and p.  236 (1887), and states indirectly that, after a correspondence with H. A. Lorentz, he can no longer maintain that in the case of the validity of Fizeau&apos;s 2nd aether hypothesis the Michelson experiment must yield a null result too. [ Bucherer, A.
