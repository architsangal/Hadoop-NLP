After the election of 2006, this reconstruction campaign was cut back by the Commissioners Court. During this period a controversial pay increase for commissioners and the county judge was passed by a 3-2 vote. After heated protests from the public the pay rates were eventually rolled back and new legislation was proposed in the state legislature to prohibit commissioners and county judges from authorizing raises for themselves during their first term of office. [ Historical ] The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Smith County were the Caddo Indians. In July of 1846 Smith County separated from the Nacogdoches District and was named for James Smith, a General of the Texas Revolution.

Since 1948, The citizens of Smith County have directed by popular vote, that all road and bridge maintenance and construction be under the &quot; Unit System &quot; as prescribed by the Texas State Transportation Code. Under the Unit System, a County Engineer, or Road Administrator is designated to direct maintenance and construction for the county as a whole without regard to individual commissioners&apos; precincts to provide the most beneficial outcome for the taxpayers of Smith County. The county infrastructure includes some 1180 miles of two lane county road. 70% of these county roads were rated as &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; poor &quot; in 2004. The county Commissioners Court appointed a new County Engineer in 2005 and an aggressive reconstruction campaign was initiated to improve the infrastructure under the &quot; Road Recovery Plan &quot;. 70% of county roads are surfaced with hot oil sand (HOSA), 15% hot mix asphalt, approx. 13% dirt, and less than 2% concrete. The &quot; Road Recovery Plan &quot; initiated under Judge Becky Dempsey, which sought to reconstruct 750 miles of county roads in a 6 year time frame, was discontinued in 2007. Road &amp; Bridge Funding has not kept pace with increases in general revenue funds since 2007. The termination of the Road Recovery Program in 2007 initiated a reduction in the commitment of the Commissioner&apos;s Court to the goal of improving the 2/3 of all County Roads rated as &quot; Bad &quot; or &quot; Poor &quot;. In the 2005 and 2006 Budgets, approximately $2 million per year was transferred from the general fund to the Road &amp; Bridge Fund to maintain the initiative. When the position of County Engineer was eliminated, Road &amp; Bridge funding as a portion of the county budget was reduced despite County Revenues rising from $43.3 million in 2005 to an estimated $65.2 million in 2012. The net effect being that revenues derived county wide were diverted to projects within the Tyler city limits while county roads fell further into disrepair and became more expensive to maintain.
