The city is also the home of Borg Bryggerier, part of the Hansa Borg Bryggerier, Norway&apos;s second largest brewery -group. [ General information ] [ Name ] In Norse times the city was just called Borg (from borg which means &quot; castle &quot; ). The background for this was the fortification built by Olav Haraldsson (see History section). Later the genitive case of the name of the waterfall Sarpr (now Sarpsfossen ) was added. In Norse times Østfold county was called Borgarsýsla which means &quot; the county (sýsla) of Borg &quot; and the law district of southeast Norway was called Borgarþing meaning &quot; the thing /court of Borg &quot;. The old name has been revived in the diocese of Borg (1968) and Borgarting Court of Appeal (1995). [ Coat-of-arms ] The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 13 November 1991. It is based on a coat-of-arms from 1556. It shows a bear over a castle. The bear was introduced as early as sometime in the 13th century, by the earl of Sarpsborg (Comes de Saresburgh), Alv Erlingsson. He used the bear to symbolize his strength. [ April 2009 ] The castle symbolizes the fortress (borg) that once gave the city its original name.

It was burned to the ground by Swedish invaders in 1567 during the Northern Seven Years&apos; War. Half the population was evacuated down the river to what is today known as Fredrikstad, about [ 15 km mi 0 ] downstream. Much of the rebuilt town disappeared into the river Glomma during a 1702 mudslide. Again Borg was rebuilt, and it was recreated as a city in 1839, and separated from Tune as a municipality of its own. The rural municipalities of Tune, Skjeberg, and Varteig were merged with the city on 1 January 1992. The population is steadily growing, and during the summer of 2005 it reached 50,000 inhabitants.
