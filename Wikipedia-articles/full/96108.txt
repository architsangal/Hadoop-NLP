[ De Witt Clinton Goodrich &amp; Charles Richard Tuttle R. S. Peale &amp; co. 1875 Indiana An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana http://books.google.com/books?id%3DYDIUAAAAYAAJ 562 ] Jefferson County was one of Indiana&apos;s first counties and many important early Hoosiers hailed from Madison, including William Hendricks. Throughout the early history of the state, Madison was one of the leading cities competing with Vincennes and later New Albany to be the largest city in the state. The county fell into economic decline after the American Civil War as industry began to shift from southern Indiana to the northern part of the state. On the evening of May 20, 2009 the county courthouse caught fire. The fire began in the steeple of the courthouse which was under reconstruction for Madison&apos;s bicentenary. The roof of the dome had just been painted gold. Fire departments from across southern Indiana and northern Kentucky arrived to put out the fire which burned for several hours, destroyed much of the inside of the building and the county records. The fire necessitated the evacuation of the nearby county jail, and effectively shut down the downtown area of the city.
