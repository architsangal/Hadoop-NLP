More than a century after the start of its construction, it remains, at 57 stories, one of the fifty-tallest buildings in the United States as well as one of the twenty-tallest buildings in New York City. Since 1966 it has been a National Historic Landmark, [ http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId%3D398%26amp%3BResourceType%3DBuilding Woolworth Building September 23, 2007 National Historic Landmark summary listing National Park Service August 31, 2011 ] [ http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/66000554.pdf The Woolworth Building Patricia Heintzelman and Cecil McKithan January 6, 1978 PDF National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination National Park Service ] [ http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Photos/66000554.pdf The Woolworth Building--Accompanying 3 photos, exterior, from 1975.

Originally planned to be [ 625 ft ] high, the building was eventually elevated to [ 792 ft ]. [ April 2011 ] The construction cost was [ 13.5 million ] and Woolworth paid all of it in cash. On completion, the Woolworth building overtook the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower as the world&apos;s-tallest building; it opened on April 24, 1913. With a resemblance to European Gothic cathedral s, the structure was labeled the Cathedral of Commerce by the Reverend S. Parkes Cadman during the opening ceremony, [ April 2011 ], although it was maligned by others due to its eclecticism. It remained the tallest building in the world until the construction of 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building, also in New York City, in 1930; an observation deck on the 57th floor attracted visitors until 1945. The building&apos;s tower, flush with the main frontage on Broadway, is raised on a block base with a narrow interior court for light. The exterior decoration was cast in limestone-colored, glazed architectural terra-cotta panels. Strongly articulated piers, carried—without interrupting cornices —right to the pyramidal cap, give the building its upward thrust. The Gothic detailing concentrated at the highly visible top is massively scaled, able to be read from the street level several hundred feet below. [ April 2011 ] Engineers Gunvald Aus and Kort Berle designed the steel frame, supported on massive caisson s that penetrate to the bedrock. The high-speed elevators were innovative, and the building&apos;s high office-to-elevator ratio made the structure profitable. [ April 2011 ] The ornate, cruciform lobby, is &quot; one of the most spectacular of the early 20th century in New York City &quot;. It is covered in Skyros veined marble, has a vaulted ceiling, mosaics, a stained-glass skylight and bronze furnishings. On the balconies of the mezzanine are the murals Labor and Commerce overlooking sculpted plaster caricatures that include Gilbert with a model of the building, Aus taking a girder&apos;s measurments, and Woolworth counting nickels. Woolworth&apos;s private office, revetted in marble in French Empire style, has been preserved. [ April 2011 ] The building&apos;s facade was restored between 1977 and 1981 by the Ehrenkrantz Group, {, p. 67. } in which much of the terra-cotta was replaced with cast stone and a lot of the gothic ornaments were removed. [ Tenants ] At the building&apos;s completion, the Woolworth Company occupied only one and a half floors of the building, but, as the owner, profited from renting space out to others, including the Irving Trust bank and Columbia Records. Columbia Records had moved into the building in 1913 and housed a recording studio in it. { Hoffman, Frank, &apos;&apos;Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound&apos;&apos;, New York &amp; London : Routledge, 1993 &amp; 2005, Volume 1. Cf. p. 212, article on &quot; Columbia (Label) &quot;. } In 1917, Columbia made a recording of a dixieland band, the Original Dixieland Jass Band in this studio. { Cogan, Jim; Clark, William, &apos;&apos;Temples of sound : inside the great recording studios&apos;&apos;, San Francisco : Chronicle Books, 2003. ISBN 0-8118-3394-1. Cf. chapter on Columbia Studios. } { &quot; The Woolworth Building &quot;, NYC Architecture } [ Recent history ] The building was owned by the Woolworth company for 85 years until 1998, when the Venator Group (formerly the F. W. Woolworth Company ) sold it to the Witkoff Group for $155 million. { recordonline.com - The Times Herald-Record, serving New York’s Hudson Valley and the Catskills } [ April 2011 ] Until recently, that company kept a presence in the building through a Foot Locker store (Foot Locker is the successor to the Woolworth Company). Prior to its 2001 destruction, the World Trade Center was often photographed in such a way that the Woolworth Building could be seen between 1 and 2 World Trade Center. [ April 2011 ] After the September 11, 2001, attacks a few blocks away, the building was without electricity, water and telephone service for a few weeks and had broken windows and the top turret was damaged by falling rubble. Increased post-attack security restricted access to most of the ornate lobby, previously a tourist attraction. [ http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/american-architectural-wonder-keep-out/5596 American Architectural Wonder: Keep Out The Chronicle of Higher Education Fendrich Laurie January 8, 2008 August 30, 2011 ] The structure has a long association with higher education, housing a number of Fordham University schools in the early 20th century. Today, the building houses, among other tenants, TTA Inc., Control Group Inc. and the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies&apos; Center for Global Affairs.

It is mentioned by name near the beginning of the 1957 12 Angry Men,, and it is featured in the 1979 film Kramer vs. Kramer, in which Billy asks his father (played by Dustin Hoffman ) its name. The building is shown as the headquarters of Mode magazine in the 2006 television series, Ugly Betty. In the 2007 Disney film Enchanted, the building is the site of the film&apos;s grand climax; and in the opening scenes of the 2008 film Cloverfield, the building is depicted collapsing after an enormous monster critically damages it. In the 2007 novel Peak, the protagonist is arrested for climbing the building. The Lincoln American Tower in Memphis, Tennessee, built in 1924, is a small replica of the building, standing at one-third its height.
