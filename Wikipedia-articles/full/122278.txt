Hurricane Katrina came ashore during the high tide of 8:01AM, raising flood waters +2.2 feet more. { &quot; 2005 NOAA Tide Predictions: Waveland &quot; (2005), tide on 29-Aug-2005, NOAA, web: NOAA-tide-tables. } Hurricane Katrina damaged over 40 Mississippi libraries, gutting the Pearlington Public Library as a total loss, requiring a complete rebuild. { &quot; Hurricane Katrina Related Damages to Public Libraries in Mississippi &quot; (September 2005), Mississippi Library Commission, web: ALA-Katrina. } Almost a year later, a member of C.O.D.R.A.

According to Vicki Smith, Associated Press writer, Pearlington was seemingly forgotten during Katrina recovery. Ten days after the hurricane more or less annihilated the tiny hamlet on the Louisiana state line, Jeff McVay and five other members of a state emergency response team from Walton County, Florida, arrived at the request of Hancock County. The town had nothing but a place to get water, ice and military-issued meals. There was no Red Cross or shelter. The homes were heaps of debris, and trees and nail-studded boards littered the roads. The people - perhaps 600 of the 1,700 residents - were living in tents and under tarps. The elementary school buildings that were still standing were opened as shelters after the water went down. Residents say that Pearlington is old and generally overlooked. It is a fairly segregated and isolated town. It has no mayor. The only form of government is the town&apos;s all volunteer fire department, West Hancock Fire Rescue, and its head, Chief Kim Jones.
