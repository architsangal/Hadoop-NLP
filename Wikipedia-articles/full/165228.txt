NetBurst differed from P6 ( Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds [ Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9650 45nm Quad Core CPU http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C2704%2C2208923%2C00.asp PC Magazine 2007-10-30 Loyd Case ] (up to 3.8  GHz) limited only by TDP s reaching up to 115 W in 3.4  GHz –3.8  GHz Prescott and Prescott 2M cores.

The first Pentium 4 cores, codenamed Willamette, were clocked from 1.3  GHz to 2  GHz. They were released on November 20, 2000, using the Socket 423 system. Notable with the introduction of the Pentium 4 was the 400   MT/s FSB. It actually operated at 100  MHz but the FSB was quad-pumped, meaning that the maximum transfer rate was four times the base clock of the bus, so it was marketed to run at 400  MHz. The AMD Athlon&apos;s double-pumped FSB was running at 100 or 133  MHz (200 or 266  MT/s) at that time. Pentium 4 CPUs introduced the SSE2 and, in the Prescott-based Pentium 4s, SSE3 instruction set s to accelerate calculations, transactions, media processing, 3D graphics, and games. Later versions featured Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT), a feature to make one physical CPU work as two logical CPUs. Intel also marketed a version of their low-end Celeron processors based on the NetBurst microarchitecture (often referred to as Celeron 4), and a high-end derivative, Xeon, intended for multiprocessor server s and workstation s. In 2005, the Pentium 4 was complemented by the Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition dual-core CPUs. [ Microarchitecture ] In benchmark evaluations, the advantages of the NetBurst microarchitecture were not clear. With carefully optimized application code, the first Pentium 4s did outperform Intel&apos;s fastest Pentium III (clocked at 1.13  GHz at the time), as expected. But in legacy applications with many branching or x87 floating-point instructions, the Pentium 4 would merely match or even fall behind its predecessor. Its main handicap was a shared unidirectional bus. Furthermore, the NetBurst microarchitecture consumed more power and emitted more heat than any previous Intel or AMD microarchitectures. As a result, the Pentium 4&apos;s introduction was met with mixed reviews: Developers disliked the Pentium 4, as it posed a new set of code optimization rules. For example, in mathematical applications AMD&apos;s lower-clocked Athlon (the fastest-clocked model was clocked at 1.2  GHz at the time) easily outperformed the Pentium 4, which would only catch up if software were re-compiled with SSE2 support. Tom Yager of Infoworld magazine called it &quot; the fastest CPU - for programs that fit entirely in cache &quot;. Computer-savvy buyers avoided Pentium 4 PCs due to their price-premium, questionable benefit, and initial restriction to Rambus RAM. In terms of product marketing, the Pentium 4&apos;s singular emphasis on clock frequency (above all else) made it a marketer&apos;s dream. The result of this was that the NetBurst microarchitecture was often referred to as a marchitecture by various computing websites and publications during the life of the Pentium 4. A synonym for the marchitecture was also in use, &quot; NetBust &quot;, popular with reviewers who reflected negatively upon the processor performance, drawing comparison to bovine manure. The two classical metrics of CPU performance are IPC (instructions per cycle) and clock speed. While IPC is difficult to quantify (due to dependence on the benchmark application&apos;s instruction mix), clock speed is a simple measurement yielding a single absolute number. Unsophisticated buyers would simply consider the processor with the highest clock speed to be the best product, and the Pentium 4 was the undisputed megahertz champion. As AMD was unable to compete by these rules, it countered Intel&apos;s marketing advantage with the &quot; megahertz myth &quot; campaign. AMD product marketing used a &quot; PR-rating &quot; system, which assigned a merit value based on relative performance to a baseline machine. A Pentium 4, clocked at 2.4 GHz At the launch of the Pentium 4, Intel stated NetBurst-based processors were expected to scale to 10  GHz (which should be achieved over several fabrication process generations). However, the NetBurst microarchitecture ultimately hit a frequency ceiling far below that expectation – the fastest clocked NetBurst-based models reached a peak clock speed of 3.8  GHz. Intel had not anticipated a rapid upward scaling of transistor power leakage that began to occur as the die reached the 90  nm lithography and smaller. This new power leakage phenomenon, along with the standard thermal output, created cooling and clock scaling problems as clock speeds increased. Reacting to these unexpected obstacles, Intel attempted several core redesigns ( &quot; Prescott &quot; most notably) and explored new manufacturing technologies, such as using multiple cores, increasing FSB speeds, increasing the cache size, and using a longer instruction pipeline along with higher clock speeds. Nothing solved their problems though and in 2003–05 Intel shifted development away from NetBurst to focus on the cooler-running Pentium M microarchitecture. On January 5, 2006, Intel launched the Core processors, which put greater emphasis on energy efficiency and performance per clock. The final NetBurst-derived products were released in 2007, with all subsequent product families switching exclusively to the Core microarchitecture. [ Processor cores ] The Pentium 4 has an integrated heat spreader (IHS) that prevents the die from accidentally getting damaged when mounting and unmounting cooling solutions. Prior to the IHS, a CPU shim was sometimes used by people worried about damaging the core. Overclockers sometimes removed the IHS on Socket 423 and Socket 478 chips to allow for more direct heat transfer. However, on processors using the Socket LGA 775 (Socket T) interface, the IHS is directly soldered to the die(s), meaning that the IHS cannot be easily removed.

The project was started in 1998, when Intel saw the Pentium II as their permanent line. At that time, the Willamette core was expected to operate at frequencies of around 1  GHz, maximum. However, Willamette&apos;s release delays saw the introduction of the Pentium III prior to its completion. Due to the radical differences between the P6 and NetBurst microarchitectures, Intel could not market Willamette as a Pentium III, so it was marketed as Pentium 4. On November 20, 2000, Intel released the Willamette-based Pentium 4 clocked at 1.4 and 1.5  GHz. Most industry experts regarded the initial release as a stopgap product, introduced before it was truly ready. According to these experts, the Pentium 4 was released because the competing Thunderbird-based AMD Athlon was outperforming the aging Pentium III, and further improvements to the Pentium III were not yet possible. [ April 2010 ] This Pentium 4 was produced using a 180  nm process and initially used Socket 423 (a.k.a. socket W, for &quot; Willamette &quot; ), with later revisions moving to Socket 478 (socket N, for &quot; Northwood &quot; ). These variants were identified by the Intel product codes 80528 and 80531 respectively. On the test bench, the Willamette was somewhat disappointing to analysts in that not only was it unable to outperform the Athlon and the highest-clocked Pentium IIIs in all testing situations, but it was not superior to the budget segment&apos;s AMD Duron. [ http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i%3D1360%26amp%3Bp%3D1 Intel Pentium 4 1.4GHz &amp; 1.5GHz Anand Lal Shimpi Anandtech November 20, 2000 ] Although introduced at prices of $644 (1.4  GHz) and $819 (1.5  GHz) for 1000 quantities to OEM PC manufacturers [ April 2010 ] (prices for models for the consumer market varied by retailer), it sold at a modest but respectable rate, handicapped somewhat by the requirement for relatively fast yet expensive Rambus Dynamic RAM ( RDRAM ). The Pentium III remained Intel&apos;s top selling processor line, with the Athlon also selling slightly better than the Pentium 4. While Intel bundled two RDRAM modules with each boxed Pentium 4, it did not facilitate Pentium 4 sales and was not considered a true solution by many. In January 2001, a still slower 1.3  GHz model was added to the range, but over the next twelve months, Intel gradually started reducing AMD&apos;s leadership in performance. In April 2001 a 1.7  GHz Pentium 4 was launched, the first model to provide performance clearly superior to the old Pentium III. July saw 1.6 and 1.8  GHz models and in August 2001, Intel released 1.9 and 2  GHz Pentium 4s. In the same month, they released the 845 chipset that supported much cheaper PC133 SDRAM instead of RDRAM. [ http://techreport.com/articles.x/2843 Scott Wasson The Pentium 4 gets SDRAM: Two new chipsets Tech Report September 10, 2001 ] The fact that SDRAM was so much cheaper caused the Pentium 4&apos;s sales to grow considerably. The new chipset allowed the Pentium 4 to replace the Pentium III virtually overnight, becoming the top-selling mainstream processor on the market. The Willamette code name is derived from the Willamette Valley region of Oregon, where a large number of Intel &apos;s manufacturing facilities are located. [ April 2010 ] [ Northwood ] { die (black square in the center), and right the } { heat spreader } In January 2002 Intel released Pentium 4s with a new core code named &quot; Northwood &quot; at speeds of 1.6  GHz, 1.8  GHz, 2  GHz and 2.2  GHz. { Wasson, Scott. AMD&apos;s Athlon XP 1800+ processor, Tech Report, October 9, 2001. } { Wasson, Scott and Brown, Andrew. Pentium 4 &apos;Northwood&apos; 2.2 GHz vs. Athlon XP 2000+, January 7, 2002. } Northwood (product code 80532) combined an increase in the L2 cache size from 256 KB to 512 KB (increasing the transistor count from 42 million to 55 million) with a transition to a new 130  nm fabrication process. Making the processor out of smaller transistors means that it can run at higher clock speeds and produce less heat. In the same month boards utilizing the 845 chipset were released with enabled support for DDR SDRAM which provided double the bandwidth of PC133 SDRAM, and alleviated the associated high costs of using Rambus RDRAM for maximal performance with Pentium 4. [ April 2011 ] A 2.4  GHz Pentium 4 was released on April 2, 2002, and the bus speed increased from 400   MT/s to 533  MT/s (133  MHz physical clock) for the 2.26  GHz, 2.4  GHz, and 2.53  GHz models in May, 2.66  GHz and 2.8  GHz models in August, and 3.06  GHz model in November. With Northwood, the Pentium 4 came of age. The battle for performance leadership remained competitive (as AMD introduced faster versions of the Athlon XP) but most observers agreed that the fastest-clocked Northwood-based Pentium 4 was usually ahead of its rival. [ April 2011 ] This was particularly so in the summer of 2002, when AMD&apos;s changeover to its 130  nm production process did not help the initial &quot; Thoroughbred A &quot; revision Athlon XP CPUs to clock high enough to overcome the advantages of Northwood in the 2.4 to 2.8  GHz range. { Wasson, Scott. AMD&apos;s Athlon XP 2800+ and NVIDIA&apos;s nForce2, Tech Report, October 1, 2002. } The 3.06  GHz Pentium 4 enabled Hyper-Threading Technology that was first supported in Foster-based Xeons. This began the convention of virtual processors (or virtual cores) under x86 by enabling multiple threads to be run at the same time on the same physical processor. [ April 2011 ] By shuffling two (ideally differing) program instructions to simultaneously execute through a single physical processor core, the goal is to best utilize processor resources that would have otherwise been unused from the traditional approach of having these single instructions wait for each other to execute singularly through the core. This initial 3.06  GHz 533FSB Pentium 4 Hyper-Threading enabled processor was not branded as such. [ April 2011 ] That would be reserved for the 800FSB variant known as Pentium 4 HT. On April 14, 2003, Intel officially launched the new Pentium 4 HT processor. This processor used a 800  MT/s FSB (200  MHz physical clock), was clocked at 3  GHz, and had Hyper-Threading Technology (which is what the HT moniker represents). { Wasson, Scott. Intel&apos;s Pentium 4 3.2 GHz processor, Tech Report, June 23, 2003. } This was meant to help the Pentium 4 better compete with AMD&apos;s Opteron line of processors. The server-oriented Opteron initially did not share a common socket with AMD&apos;s desktop processor line (Socket A). Because of this, motherboard manufacturers did not initially build motherboards with AGP for Opterons. As AGP was the primary graphics expansion port for desktop use, this oversight prevented the Opteron from encroaching from the server market and threatening the Pentium 4 desktop market. Meanwhile with the launch of the Athlon XP 3200+ in AMD&apos;s desktop line, AMD increased the Athlon XP&apos;s FSB speed from 333  MT/s to 400  MT/s, but it was not enough to hold off the new 3  GHz Pentium 4 HT. { Wasson, Scott. AMD&apos;s Athlon XP 3200+ processor, Tech Report, May 13, 2003. } The Pentium 4 HT&apos;s increase to a 200  MHz quad-pumped bus (200x4=800Mhz effective) greatly helped to satisfy the bandwidth requirements the Netburst architecture desired for reaching optimal performance. While the Athlon XP architecture was less dependent on bandwidth, the bandwidth numbers reached by Intel were well out of range for the Athlon&apos;s EV6 bus. Hypothetically, EV6 could have achieved the same bandwidth numbers, but only at speeds unreachable at the time. Intel&apos;s higher bandwidth proved useful in benchmarks for streaming operations [ April 2011 ], and Intel marketing wisely capitalized on this as a tangible improvement over AMD&apos;s desktop processors [ April 2011 ]. Northwood 2.4  GHz, 2.6  GHz and 2.8  GHz variants were released on May 21, 2003. A 3.2  GHz variant was launched on June 23, 2003 and the final 3.4  GHz version arrived on February 2, 2004. Overclocking early stepping Northwood cores yielded a startling phenomenon. While core voltage approaching 1.7 V and above would often allow substantial additional gains in overclocking headroom, the processor would slowly (over several months or even weeks) become more unstable over time with a degradation in maximum stable clock speed before dying and becoming totally unusable. This became known as Sudden Northwood Death Syndrome (SNDS), which is caused by electromigration. { Shilov, Anton. Sudden Overclocked Northwood Death Syndrome. Is It Strange That Overclocked CPUs Eventually Die?, X-bit Labs, December 6, 2002. } [ Pentium 4-M ] Also based on the Northwood core, the Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor - M [ http://www.intel.com/design/mobile/datashts/250686.htm Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor-M Datasheet Intel Corp ] was released on April 23, 2002 and included Intel&apos;s SpeedStep and Deeper Sleep technologies. Intel&apos;s naming conventions made it difficult at the time of the processor&apos;s release to identify the processor model. There was the Pentium III mobile chip, the Mobile Pentium 4-M, the Mobile Pentium 4, and then just the Pentium M which itself was based on the Pentium III and significantly faster than the former three. Its TDP is about 35 watts in most applications. This lowered power consumption was due to lowered core voltage, and other features mentioned previously. Unlike the desktop Pentium 4, the Pentium 4-M did not feature an integrated heat spreader (IHS), since it operates at a lower voltage. The lower voltage means lower power consumption, and in turn less heat. However, according to Intel specifications, the Pentium 4-M had a maximum thermal junction temperature rating of 100 degrees C, approximately 40 degrees higher than the desktop Pentium 4. [ Mobile Pentium 4 ] The Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor [ http://www.intel.com/products/processor/mobilepentium4/index.htm Intel&apos;s Mobile Pentium 4 Intel Corp ] was released to address the problem of putting a full desktop Pentium 4 processor into a laptop, which some manufacturers were doing. The Mobile Pentium 4 used a 533  MT/s FSB, following the desktop Pentium 4&apos;s evolution. Oddly, increasing the bus speed by 133  MT/s (33  MHz) caused a massive increase in TDPs, as mobile Pentium 4 processors emitted 59.8 W - 70 W of heat, with the Hyper-Threading variants emitting 66.1 W - 88 W. This allowed the mobile Pentium 4 to bridge the gap between the desktop Pentium 4 (up to 115 W TDP), and the Pentium 4-M (up to 35 W TDP). [ Gallatin (Extreme Edition) ] In September 2003, at the Intel Developer Forum, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition (P4EE) was announced, just over a week before the launch of Athlon 64 and Athlon 64 FX. The design was mostly identical to Pentium 4 (to the extent that it would run in the same motherboards), but differed by an added 2 MB of level 3 cache. It shared the same Gallatin core as the Xeon MP, though in a Socket 478 form factor (as opposed to Socket 603 for the Xeon MP) and with an 800  MT/s bus, twice as fast as that of the Xeon MP. While Intel maintained that the Extreme Edition was aimed at gamers, critics viewed it as an attempt to steal the Athlon 64&apos;s launch thunder, nicknaming it the &quot; Emergency Edition &quot;. With a price tag of $999, it was also referred to as the &quot; Expensive Edition &quot; or &quot; Extremely Expensive &quot;. The added cache generally resulted in a noticeable performance increase in most processor intensive applications. Multimedia encoding and certain games benefited the most, with the Extreme Edition outperforming the Pentium 4, and even the two Athlon 64 variants, although the lower price and more balanced performance of the Athlon 64 (particularly the non-FX version) led to it usually being seen as the better value proposition. Nonetheless, the Extreme Edition did achieve Intel&apos;s apparent aim, which was to prevent AMD from being the performance champion with the new Athlon 64, who was winning every single major benchmark over the existing Pentium 4s. In January 2004 a 3.4  GHz version was released for Socket 478, and in Summer 2004 the CPU was released using the new Socket 775. A slight performance increase was achieved in late 2004 by increasing the bus speed from 800  MT/s to 1066  MT/s, resulting in a 3.46  GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition. By most metrics, this was on a per-clock basis the fastest single-core NetBurst processor that was ever produced, even outperforming many of its successor chips (not counting the dual-core Pentium D). Afterwards, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was migrated to the Prescott core. The new 3.73  GHz Extreme Edition had the same features as a 6x0-sequence Prescott 2M, but with a 1066  MT/s bus. In practice however, the 3.73  GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition almost always proved to be slower than the 3.46  GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition, which is most likely due to the lack of an L3 cache and the longer instruction pipeline. The only advantage the 3.73  GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition had over the 3.46  GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was the ability to run 64-bit applications since all Gallatin-based Pentium 4 Extreme Edition processors lacked the Intel 64 instruction set. Although never a particularly good seller, especially since it was released in a time when AMD were asserting near total dominance in the processor performance race, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition established a new position within Intel&apos;s product line, that of an enthusiast oriented chip with the highest-end specifications offered by Intel chips, along with unlocked multipliers to allow for easier overclocking. In this role it has since been succeeded by the Pentium Extreme Edition (The Extreme version of the dual-core Pentium D ), the Core 2 Extreme, and most recently, the Core i7. [ Prescott ] Top view of an Intel Pentium 4 Prescott 640 model Top view of a Pentium 4 Prescott 640, 3.2  GHz Bottom view of an Intel Pentium 4 Prescott 640 model Bottom view of a Pentium 4 Prescott 640 On February 1, 2004, Intel introduced a new core codenamed &quot; Prescott &quot;. The core used the 90 nm process for the first time, which one analyst described as &quot; a major reworking of the Pentium 4&apos;s microarchitecture—major enough that I am surprised Intel did not opt to call this processor the Pentium 5. &quot; [ http://techreport.com/articles.x/6213/1 Intel&apos;s Pentium 4 Prescott processor The Tech Report February 2, 2004 2007-08-28 ] Despite this overhaul, the performance gains were inconsistent. Some programs benefited from Prescott&apos;s doubled cache and SSE3 instructions, whereas others were harmed by its longer pipeline. The Prescott&apos;s microarchitecture allowed slightly higher clock speeds, but not nearly as high as Intel had anticipated. The fastest mass-produced Prescott-based Pentium 4s were clocked at 3.8  GHz. While Northwood ultimately achieved clock speeds 70% higher than Willamette, Prescott scaled 12% beyond Northwood. Prescott&apos;s inability to achieve greater clock speeds was attributed to the very high power consumption and heat output of the processor. In fact, Prescott&apos;s power and heat characteristics were only slightly higher than those of Northwood of the same speed and nearly-equal to the Gallatin-based Extreme Editions, but since those processors had already been operating near the limits of what was considered thermally acceptable, this still posed a major issue. [ http://www.anandtech.com/show/1296/3 CPU Heat Comparison: How Hot is Prescott? AnandTech 2004-04-16 2012-01-08 ] The &quot; Prescott &quot; Pentium 4 contains 125 million transistors and has a die area of 122  mm 2. [ http://techreport.com/articles.x/6213/1 Intel&apos;s Pentium 4 Prescott processor The Tech Report 2004-02-02 2012-01-08 ] { Glaskowsky, Peter N. (2 February 2004). &quot; Prescott Pushes Pipelining Limits &quot;. } { Microprocessor Report. } It was fabricated in a 90  nm process with seven levels of copper interconnect. The process has features such as strained silicon transistors and Low-K carbon-doped silicon oxide (CDO) dielectric, which is also known as organosilicate glass (OSG). The Prescott was first fabricated at the D1C development fab and was later moved to F11X production fab. Originally, Intel released two Prescott lines: the E-series, with an 800  MT/s FSB and Hyper-Threading support, and the low-end A-series, with a 533  MT/s FSB and Hyper-Threading disabled. Intel eventually added XD Bit (eXecute Disable) and Intel 64 functionality to Prescott. LGA 775 Prescott uses a rating system, labeling them as the 5xx series (Celeron Ds are the 3xx series, while Pentium Ms are the 7xx series). The LGA 775 version of the E-series uses model numbers 5x0 (520-560), and the LGA 775 version of the A-series uses model numbers 5x5 and 5x9 (505-519). The fastest, the 570J and 571, is clocked at 3.8  GHz. Plans to mass-produce a 4  GHz Pentium 4 were cancelled by Intel in favor of dual core processors, although some European retailers claimed to be selling a Pentium 4 580, clocked at 4  GHz. The 5x0J series (and its low-end equivalent, the 5x5J and 5x9J series) introduced the XD Bit (eXecute Disable) or Execute Disabled Bit [ http://www.intel.com/business/bss/infrastructure/security/xdbit.htm IT Infrastructure – Intel Resources for IT Managers Intel.com 2012-01-08 ] to Intel&apos;s line of processors. This technology, introduced to the x86 line by AMD and called NX (No eXecute), can help prevent certain types of malicious code from exploiting a buffer overflow to get executed. Intel also released a series of Prescott supporting Intel 64, Intel&apos;s implementation of the AMD-developed x86-64 64-bit extensions to the x86 architecture. These were originally released as the F-series, and only sold to OEMs, but they were later renamed to the 5x1 series and sold to the general public. Two low-end Intel64-enabled Prescotts, based on the 5x5/5x9 series, were also released with model numbers 506 and 516. 5x0, 5x0J, and 5x1 series Prescott incorporates Hyper-Threading in order to speed up some processes that use multithreaded software, such as video editing. The 5x1 series also supports 64 bit computing. [ Prescott 2M (Extreme Edition) ] Intel, by the first quarter of 2005, released a new Prescott core with 6x0 numbering, codenamed &quot; Prescott 2M &quot;. Prescott 2M is also sometimes known by the name of its Xeon derivative, &quot; Irwindale &quot;. It features Intel 64, the XD Bit, EIST (Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology), Tm2 (for processors at 3.6  GHz and above), and 2 MB of L2 cache. However, higher cache latency and the double word size, if using Intel 64 mode, negated any advantage that added cache introduced. Rather than being a targeted speed boost the double size cache was intended to provide the same space and hence performance for 64-bit mode operations. 6xx series Prescott 2Ms have incorporated Hyper-Threading in order to speed up some processes that use multithreaded software, such as video editing. On November 14, 2005, Intel released Prescott 2M processors with VT ( Virtualization Technology, codenamed &quot; Vanderpool &quot; ) enabled. Intel only released two models of this Prescott 2M category: 662 and 672, running at 3.6  GHz and 3.8  GHz, respectively. [ Cedar Mill ] The final revision of the Pentium 4 was Cedar Mill, released on January 5, 2006. This was a die shrink of the Prescott-based 600 series core to 65 nm, with no real feature additions but significantly reduced power consumption. Cedar Mill had a lower heat output than Prescott, with a TDP of 86 W. The Core Stepping of D0 in late 2006 reduced this to 65 watts. It has a 65  nm core and features a 31-stage pipeline (just like Prescott), 800  MT/s FSB, Intel 64, Hyper-Threading, but no Virtualization Technology. As with Prescott 2M, Cedar Mill also has a 2 MB L2 cache. It was released as Pentium 6x1 and 6x3 (product code 80552) at frequencies from 3  GHz up to 3.6  GHz. Overclockers managed to exceed 8  GHz with these processors using liquid Nitrogen cooling. [ http://www.nordichardware.com/news%2C5505.html OC Team Italy sets a new world record at 8GHz NordicHardware January 22, 2007 2008-01-11 http://web.archive.org/web/20080526053404/http%3A//www.nordichardware.com/news%2C5505.html 2008-05-26 ] To distinguish Cedar Mill cores from Prescott cores with the same features, Intel added 1 to their model numbers. Thus, Pentium 4 631, 641, 651 and 661 are 65  nm microprocessors, while Pentium 630, 640, 650 and 660 respectively are their 90  nm equivalents. The name &quot; Cedar Mill &quot; refers to Cedar Mill, Oregon, a neighborhood near Intel&apos;s Hillsboro, Oregon facilities. [ Successor ] [ Intel Core 2 ] The original successor to the Pentium 4 was (codenamed) Tejas, which was scheduled for an early-mid-2005 release. However, it was cancelled a few months after the release of Prescott due to extremely high TDPs (a 2.8  GHz Tejas emitted 150 W of heat, compared to around 80 W for a Northwood of the same speed, and 100 W for a comparably clocked Prescott) and development on the NetBurst microarchitecture as a whole ceased, with the exception of the dual-core Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition and the Cedar Mill-based Pentium 4 HT. Since May 2005, Intel has released dual-core processors based on the Pentium 4 under the names Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition. They represent Intel&apos;s shift towards parallelism and their intent was to eventually make the bulk of their main processor line multiple-core. These came under the code names Smithfield and Presler for the 90  nm and 65  nm parts respectively. The ultimate successors to Pentium 4 are the Intel Core 2 processors using the &quot; Conroe &quot; core based upon the Core microarchitecture, released on July 27, 2006. Intel Core 2 processors have been released as single, dual and quad core processors. Single core counterparts are present in the Intel Core 2 line, primarily for the OEM market, while dual and quad core processors can be sold to retail and OEM.
