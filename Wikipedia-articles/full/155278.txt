[ England Langley Slough Berkshire South East England Slough SLOUGH SL3 SL 01753 TQ005795 51.5059 -0.5526 http://www.langleyvillage.co.uk/ ] Langley (also known as Langley Marish) is a large village in the unitary authority of Slough, Berkshire in South East England. It is situated 2 miles (3.2 km) east of central Slough, and 19 miles (30.5 km) west of Charing Cross in Central London. Langley was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire in 1974. [ Etymology ] The place-name Langley derives from two Middle English words: Lang (meaning Long) and Leah (meaning wood or clearing). Historically, Langley was made up of a number of clearings, known as: George Green, Horsemoor Green, Middle Green, Sawyers Green and Shreding Green. These became the sites of housing, which merged into one large village centred on the church in St Mary&apos;s Road. The former clearings are remembered in the names of streets or smaller green fields. The appended Marish or Maries commemorates Christiana de Marecis, who held the manor for a short time in the reign of Edward I. { Langley Village history; James John Hornby, Walks Round About Eton, 1895: 18. } [ History ] [ Notable buildings ] { The parish church of St Mary the Virgin is in the parish of Langley Marish in the diocese of } { Oxford.

[ Langley Airfield ] { The } { Hawker Aircraft Company bought Parlaunt Farm at Langley in 1938 and built a major factory and airfield there. Many aircraft were manufactured there and on the Slough Trading Estate during World War II, including the } { Hawker Hurricane, } { Tempest and } { Sea Fury. The final Hurricane built (a MkIIC serialled PZ865, which still flies today with the } { Battle of Britain Memorial Flight ) was completed here on 15 September 1944 and named &apos;Last of The Many&apos; in a special ceremony. } The Hawker Tornado (1940), Typhoon (1940), Tempest (1942), Fury (1944), Sea Fury (1945), and the General Aircraft Hamilcar X tank-carrying glider (1945) all made their first flights from Langley. Postwar, the aerodrome was used by Airwork Ltd and British South American Airways for aircraft maintenance work. The Hawker factory closed in 1958. Production and staff were transferred to Dunsfold Aerodrome and Kingston-on-Thames (now Kingston upon Thames ) in Surrey. Little of the factory or airfield remain today. The area&apos;s aviation past is remembered in street-names such as Spitfire Close and Hurricane Way. [ Ford ] The Ford Motor Company opened a commercial vehicle component factory at Langley Airfield in 1949, and then bought the entire ex-Hawker site in 1959. The former aircraft factory was re-used for commercial vehicle manufacture and the Ford Transit was built here until production was transferred to Swaythling, Southampton, and later the Ford Cargo. The Langley factory became part of Iveco in 1986 but finally closed in September 1997. Demolished a year later by Gregory Demolition, the redeveloped site is now the site of housing, offices and warehousing (including Royal Mail &apos;s International Mail Centre, which services nearby Heathrow Airport ).
