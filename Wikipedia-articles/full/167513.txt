It consists largely of zinc sulfide in crystal line form but almost always contains variable iron. When iron content is high it is an opaque black variety, marmatite. It is usually found in association with galena, pyrite, and other sulfide s along with calcite, dolomite, and fluorite. Miners have also been known to refer to sphalerite as zinc blende and black-jack. [ Chemistry ] [ The crystal structure of sphalerite ] The mineral crystallizes in the cubic crystal system. In the crystal structure, zinc and sulfur atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated. The structure is closely related to the structure of diamond. The hexagonal analog is known as the wurtzite structure. The lattice constant for zinc sulfide in the zincblende crystal structure is 0.541 nm, { International Centre for Diffraction Data reference 04-004-3804, ICCD reference 04-004-3804. } calculated from geometry and ionic radii of 0.074  nm (zinc) and 0.184  nm (sulfide). It forms ABCABC layers. [ Varieties ] Sharp, tetrahedral sphalerite crystals with minor associated chalcopyrite from the Idarado Mine, Telluride, Ouray District, Colorado, USA (size: 2.3×2.3×1.2 cm) Its color is usually yellow, brown, or gray to gray-black, and it may be shiny or dull. Its luster is adamantine, resinous to submetallic for high iron varieties. It has a yellow or light brown streak, a Mohs hardness of 3.5–4, and a specific gravity of 3.9–4.1. Some specimens have a red iridescence within the gray-black crystals; these are called &quot; ruby sphalerite. &quot; The pale yellow and red varieties have very little iron and are translucent. The darker more opaque varieties contain more iron. Some specimens are also fluorescent in ultraviolet light. The refractive index of sphalerite (as measured via sodium light, 589.3  nm) is 2.37. Sphalerite crystallizes in the isometric crystal system and possesses perfect dodecahedral cleavage. Gemmy, pale specimens from Franklin, New Jersey (see Franklin Furnace ) are highly fluorescent orange and/or blue under longwave ultraviolet light and are known as cleiophane, an almost pure ZnS variety. [ Occurrence ] Sphalerite is the major ore of zinc and is found in thousands of locations worldwide. Sources of high quality crystals include: Watson Lake, Yukon Territory Gord Cowie at Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting processes Sphalerite in Flin Flon, Manitoba { In the USA } the Tri-State district including deposits near Baxter Springs, Cherokee County, Kansas; Joplin, Jasper County, Missouri and Picher, Ottawa County, Oklahoma From the Elmwood mine, near Carthage, Smith County, Tennessee the Eagle mine, Gilman district, Eagle County, Colorado { In } { Mexico, from } { Santa Eulalia and } { Naica, } { Chihuahua, and } { Cananea, } { Sonora } { Huaron, } { Casapalca, and } { Huancavelica, } { Peru } [ Gemstone use ] Gemmy, 1.8 cm, twinned, cherry-red sphalerite crystal from Hunan Province, China Crystals of suitable size and transparency have been fashioned into gemstone s, usually featuring the brilliant cut to best display sphalerite&apos;s high dispersion of 0.156 (B-G interval)—over three times that of diamond. Freshly cut gems have an adamantine luster. Owing to the softness and fragility the gems are often left unset as collector&apos;s or museum pieces (although some have been set into pendants). Gem-quality material is usually a yellowish to honey brown, red to orange, or green.
