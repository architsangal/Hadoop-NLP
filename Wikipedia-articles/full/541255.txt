The answer given included the words: &quot; In the current financial year orders have been placed for an anti-submarine cruiser—HMS Illustrious —a nuclear-powered fleet submarine, a Type 22 frigate and a Type 42 destroyer. &quot; 1959-1979 3 3 ] [ 80,000 shp MW on in ] [ 31.5 kn km/h 1 ] [ 16 kn km/h 0 ] {Infobox Ship Image Ship image= 300px Ship caption= HMS &apos;&apos;Tiger&apos;&apos; before conversion}} Four Admiralty-type three drum boilers Four shaft Parsons steam turbines 8,000 nautical miles (15,000 km) at 716 (885 after conversion of Blakeand Tiger) As built: *2 × twin 6 in guns QF Mark N5 with RP15 (hydraulic) or RP53 (electric) RPC (One later removed from Blakeand Tiger) *3 × twin 3 in guns QF Mark N1 As helicopter cruisers (Blake &amp; Tiger): *1 × twin 6 in guns QF Mark N5 with RP15 (hydraulic) or RP53 (electric) RPC *1 × twin 3 in guns QF Mark N1 *2 × quad GWS.21 Sea Cat missile launchers *Belt 3.5 in - 3.25 in *Bulkheads 2 in - 1.5 in *Turrets 2 in - 1 in *Crowns of engine room and magazines 2 in 4 × helicopter s (originally Wessex then Sea King ) The Tiger-class cruisers were the last cruisers built for the Royal Navy. They were originally designed to be &apos;&apos;Minotaur&apos;&apos;-class light cruiser s, but they were laid down as World War II was ending, and accordingly only three were completed. Three other ships of the Minotaur class had their construction either suspended or cancelled in 1946; two more were broken up. Of the suspended Minotaurs, Bellerophon was completed as Tiger, the name ship of the new Tiger class, Blake was completed under her own name, { Although she had been named Tiger halfway through the process, then renamed Blake. } and Defence was completed as Lion. Conversion of Blake and Tiger to helicopter cruisers in the 1960s left no money to convert Lion, and she was scrapped. These ships were the first and last helicopter cruisers to serve in the Royal Navy. { The } [ Invincible aircraft carriers ] { were described as &quot; through deck cruisers &quot; during the procurement process, partly to avoid the impression of buying aircraft carriers } By 1979 the last of them had been withdrawn from service. [ Design and commissioning ] Construction of the three suspended ships resumed in 1954 to a revised design known as the Tiger class, as the many World War II-era cruisers were coming to the end of their service life. All such cruisers would be out of service by the 1960s due to the many defence cuts that the Royal Navy suffered. The design of the Tigers differed from the original Minotaurs in that they were armed with two state-of-the-art automatic twin mount [ 6 in mm 0 on ] guns designed just for the Tigers rather than the more obsolete three triple mount [ 6 in mm 0 on ] guns used for the Minotaurs which had been designed in 1929. They were the last [ 6 in mm 0 on ] guns used by the RN. Instead of the five twin mount [ 4 in mm 0 on ] guns designed in 1934, the Tigers used 3 twin mount [ 3 in mm 0 on ] guns, also designed for the Tigers, and which saw service in only the Tigers and the Canadian &apos;&apos;Restigouche&apos;&apos;-class destroyer. The first ship to be commissioned was &apos;&apos;Tiger&apos;&apos; in 1959, with &apos;&apos;Lion&apos;&apos; in 1960 and &apos;&apos;Blake&apos;&apos; the following year, nearly two-decades after the ships had been laid down. They were, however, obsolete, in that they were not armed with missile systems. Other ship classes that were close to entering service, such as the &apos;&apos;Leander&apos;&apos;-class and Tribal-class frigate s were being equipped with the SeaCat missile system, though only three of the Tribals would be armed with that missile system. As all three ships required large crews, they were decommissioned into maintained reserve, starting in 1963 with Blake, followed by Lion in the autumn of 1965, and in 1968, Tiger too was placed in reserve.

And while some funding had been assembled, not enough could be pulled together for Lion&apos;s conversion, and hers was cancelled, though she remained operational until the end of 1965. One aft twin mount 6  inch gun was removed to allow the addition of a large helicopter hangar and helicopter pad that would be capable of handling four helicopters. The mid-ship mounted two twin mount 3  in guns were also removed to make way for two quad Seacat missile launchers. More modern sensor equipment and command and control facilities were also added, that would enable them to perform in a very capable role as a flagship for task groups. The conversions left Tiger and Blake some 380 tons heavier with a full displacement of 12,080 tons and their crew complements increased by 169 to 885. During conversion they had lost their much loved sleek cruiser lines and their new appearance was criticised for being an ungainly and inelegant ‘push me-pull me’ design, and both vessels were soon nicknamed ‘Ugly Ducklings’. Originally Lion was also to have been converted, although this never materialised: Blake’s conversion had been more expensive than envisaged (£5.5 million) and so funds were no longer available. Ironically Tiger’s conversion cost even more (£13.25 million), such was the level of inflation at the time. After much material was stripped off her for use as spares for her sisters; Lion was subsequently sold for breaking up in 1975. Conversion of Swiftsure and Superb to the Tiger class standard was implemented but not completed; Swiftsure&apos;s refit was cancelled after much of the conversion work was completed (new superstructures and masts were fitted, but not her new weaponry), while Superbs never started. [ Obsolescence and decommissioning ] In 1969, Blake returned to service followed by Tiger in 1972. However, the crew-intensive Tigers &amp; #39; days were numbered. In 1973, Lion was used as a parts hulk to maintain Blake and Tiger. With &apos;&apos;Ark Royal&apos;&apos;’s entry into reserve, Tiger and Blake were the only major Royal Navy vessels capable of performing the fundamental anti-submarine warfare role. The conversion had given Tiger and Blake between fifteen and twenty years&apos; further service, but the manpower shortages that the Royal Navy faced in the 1970s quickened their demise. [ January 2009 ] The recommissioning of two carriers, &apos;&apos;Bulwark&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Hermes&apos;&apos; now configured to perform anti-submarine warfare, vital against the Soviet Union submarine threat in the Atlantic, a role that the Tigers had been used for, decreased the importance of the Tigers even further. In April 1978 Tiger was withdrawn from service, followed by Blake in 1979 and both ships were laid up in reserve at HMRNB Chatham. When Blake decommissioned in 1979, she had the distinction of being the last cruiser to serve the Royal Navy and her passing was marked on 6 December 1979, when she ceremonially fired her 6-inch guns for the last time in the English Channel. Just a few days after the Falklands War started, both Blake and Tiger were rapidly surveyed to determine their condition for reactivation. Both ships were found to be in very good condition and were dry-docked (Blake at Chatham, and Tiger at Portsmouth) and round the clock reactivation work immediately begun. By mid-May it was determined the ships would not be completed in time to take part in the war and the work was stopped. [ March 2011 ] Though Chile showed some interest in acquiring both ships, the sale did not proceed and the ships sat at anchor in an unmaintained condition until sold. [ March 2011 ] Blake was then sold for breaking up in late 1982, followed by Tiger in 1986.
