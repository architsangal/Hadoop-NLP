The population was 22,322 at the 2010 census. Alliance&apos;s nickname is &quot; The Carnation City &quot;, and the city is home to the University of Mount Union. The Stark County portion of Alliance is part of the Canton – Massillon Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the small Mahoning County portion is part of the Youngstown – Warren – Boardman, OH- PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. [ History ] Alliance was founded in 1854 by the merger of three smaller communities called Williamsport (formed in 1827), Freedom (formed in 1838), and Liberty (formed in 1850). A fourth community, Mount Union, was added in 1888. Alliance was incorporated as a city in 1889. { Incorporation of Alliance, Rodman Public Library website (accessed 3 February 2008) } There are two popular theories regarding the origin of the city&apos;s name. One holds that it was chosen because of the &quot; alliance &quot; of three small settlements into a larger entity. { City of Alliance website (accessed 3 February 2008) } The other theory says the name reflects the fact that two major railroad lines (the Cleveland and Wellsville Railroad and the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad ) intersected in Alliance, once known as &quot; The Crossing &quot;. { Alliance, Ohio FAQ } Alliance is a town where Main Street was originally laid out to bring traffic to the train station, the heart of the city&apos;s transportation hub. The railroads were central to industry and personal transportation, bringing in raw materials for factories and sending out finished goods. Due to this, Alliance is sometimes referred to as &quot; The town where Main Street is a dead end. &quot; { http://www.alliancehistory.org/history.html } Alliance is a town rich with social, industrial and railroad history, with the restored Glamorgan Castle, previous home of the owner of Morgan Engineering, the Haines House, a restored underground railroad home, and the Mabel Hartzell Historic home. The name of Levi L. Lamborn, the man who cultivated the red carnation, Ohio&apos;s state flower, can still be seen on the facade of a building in the old downtown district. The Richardsonian Romanesque stone house of the Devine family is currently being renovated. The historic downtown area is experiencing a gradual renaissance, with the opening of a Saturday Farmers&apos; Market on Main Street near the historic Caboose, and the renovation of a storefront on Main Street as an art gallery and live performance space, joining a scattering of antique shops and other businesses. The Cat Fanciers&apos; Association relocated to the former Midland-Buckeye bank at 260 East Main St. in June 2011, opening the CFA Foundation&apos;s Feline Historical Museum, which is the first of its kind of the United States.

[ The Carnation City ] Alliance is commonly referred to as the Carnation City, having been given that designation by the Ohio General Assembly in 1959. { Dr. Lamborn&apos;s Carnations, Rodman Public Library website (accessed 3 February 2008) } Alliance gave Ohio its official state flower, the scarlet carnation. Alliance&apos;s association with the carnation began in 1866 when an Alliance doctor, Levi L. Lamborn, purchased six potted carnation plants to grow in a greenhouse at his house. At that time this flower was rarely cultivated in the United States. In 1876 Lamborn ran against William McKinley for the Congress ional seat from this district. The two men were personal friends, although they were political opponents. McKinley had expressed his admiration for Lamborn&apos;s carnations, so before each of their political debate s Lamborn gave McKinley a carnation to wear on his lapel. Mr. McKinley won the election and associated the carnation with his success, and wore carnations during his successful campaigns for Governor of Ohio and then President of the United States. In 1884 Lamborn suggested that Ohio should make the carnation a state emblem. In 1904, three years after President McKinley&apos;s assassination, the Ohio General Assembly designated the scarlet carnation as the official state flower as a &quot; token of love and reverence to the memory of William McKinley &quot;. On 29 January of each year (President McKinley&apos;s birth anniversary), a bouquet of red carnations is placed in the hands of McKinley&apos;s statue at the Capitol in Columbus. Every year since 1960 Alliance has held a Carnation Festival { Greater Alliance Carnation Festival website } during August.
