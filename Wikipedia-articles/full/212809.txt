United Kingdom &quot; Play &quot; &quot; Sense &quot; http://www.honda.co.uk ] &quot; Cog &quot; is a British television and cinema advertisement launched by Honda in 2003 to promote the seventh-generation Accord line of cars. It follows a chain of colliding parts taken from a disassembled Accord. Wieden+Kennedy developed a GB£6  million marketing campaign around &quot; Cog &quot; and its partner pieces, &quot; Sense &quot; and &quot; Everyday &quot;, broadcast later in the year. The piece itself was produced on a budget of £1  million by Partizan Midi-Minuit. Antoine Bardou-Jacquet directed the seven-month production, contracting The Mill to handle post-production. The 120-second final cut of &quot; Cog &quot; was broadcast on British television on 6 April 2003, during a commercial break in ITV &apos;s coverage of the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix. The campaign was very successful both critically and financially. Honda&apos;s UK domain saw more web traffic in the 24  hours after &quot; Cog &quot; &apos;s television début than all but one UK automotive brand received during that entire month. The branded content attached to &quot; Cog &quot; through interactive television was accessed by over 250,000 people, and 10,000 people followed up with a request for a brochure for the Honda Accord or a DVD copy of the advertisement. The media reaction to the advertisement was equally effusive; The Independent &apos;s Peter York described it as creating &quot; the water-cooler ad conversation of the year &quot;, { York, Peter; &quot; Click-Start: Honda&apos;s Chain Reaction is Poetry in Motion &quot;, } { The Independent, 13 April 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2009. } while Quentin Letts of The Daily Telegraph believed it was &quot; certain to become an advertising legend &quot;. The high cost of 120-second slots in televised commercial breaks meant that the full version of &quot; Cog &quot; was broadcast only a handful of times, and only in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden. Despite its limited run, it is regarded as one of the most groundbreaking { &quot; Honda &apos;cog&apos; ad at centre of rip-off debate over 1987 film, } { Marketing, 27 May 2003. Retrieved 29 March 2011. } { Sweney, Mark; &quot; Guinness ad topples record &quot;, } { The Guardian, 8 November 2007. Retrieved 29 March 2011. } and influential commercials of the 2000s, and received more awards from the television and advertising industries than any commercial in history. Its success was blighted, however, by persistent accusations of plagiarism by Peter Fischli and David Weiss, the creators of The Way Things Go (1987). [ Sequence ] &quot; Cog &quot; opens with a close-up on a transmission bearing rolling down a board into a synchro hub. The hub in turn rolls into a gear wheel cog, which falls off of the board and into a camshaft and pulley wheel. The camera tracks slowly from left to right, following the domino chain of reactions across an otherwise empty gallery space. The complexity of the interactions increases as the commercial progresses, growing from simple collisions to zipline s made from a bonnet release cable, scales and see-saws constructed from multiple carefully balanced parts, and a swinging mobile of suspended glass windows. Later sequences begin to make use of the Accord&apos;s electronic systems; the automated water sensors attached to the windscreen are used to make wiper blades start crawling across the floor. The earlier sections of &quot; Cog &quot; take place in complete silence, the only sounds coming from the collisions of the pieces themselves. This is broken with the activation of the CD player from the Accord, which begins playing The Sugarhill Gang &apos;s 1979 single &quot; Rapper&apos;s Delight &quot;. The sequence ends when the button of an electronic key fob is pressed, closing the hatchback of a fully assembled Honda Accord on a carefully balanced trailer. The car rolls in front of a tonneau cover bearing the &quot; Accord &quot; marque, while narrator Garrison Keillor asks &quot; Isn&apos;t it nice when things just work? &quot;. The screen fades to white and the piece closes on the Honda logo and the brand&apos;s motto, &quot; The Power of Dreams &quot;. [ Production ] [ Background ] { Honda Accord. } Sales of Honda products within Europe had been in decline since 1998, and the company&apos;s position as the number two Japan ese automotive company, behind Toyota, had been taken by Nissan. European consumers perceived the brand as staid, uninspiring, and the cars to be of lesser quality than those produced by European manufacturers. { Manning, Jeff; &quot; Mechanical Marvel &quot;, } { The Oregonian, 29 April 2003. } In one survey, one quarter of respondents &quot; wouldn&apos;t dream of buying a Honda as their next car &quot;. { &quot; Which brand has the best advertising? Honda &quot;, Creative Review, 22 September 2004. } It was in this climate in 2001 that Wieden+Kennedy proposed to Honda a new advertising strategy based on the company&apos;s Japanese motto, &quot; Yume No Chikara &quot; ( &quot; Power of Dreams &quot; ). The stated goal of the campaign was to increase Honda&apos;s share of the UK market to five percent within three years and to change the public image of the brand from &quot; dull but functional &quot; to &quot; warm and consumer-friendly &quot;, all on a lower marketing budget than their predecessors had demanded. { Dobele, Angela; Toleman, David; Beverland, Michael; &quot; Controlled infection! Spreading the brand message through viral marketing &quot;, } { Business Horizons, Vol. 48, No. 2, March 2005, pp. 143-149. } The first series of promotions in the United Kingdom adopted the strapline &quot; What if...? &quot;, and explored various &quot; dream-like &quot; scenarios. The first television campaign explicitly introduced the premise of the campaign by asking what would happen if the world&apos;s favourite word ( Okay ) was replaced with &quot; What if? &quot;. The next few pieces of the campaign, &quot; Pecking Order &quot;, &quot; Seats &quot;, and &quot; Bus Lane &quot; for television and &quot; Doodle &quot;, &quot; Big Grin &quot;, and &quot; Oblonger &quot; for radio, became progressively more surreal, and featured oddities ranging from a traffic cone draped in leopard fur to trees growing traffic lights from their branches. In 2002, Matt Gooden, a creative director, and Ben Walker, a copywriter, proposed a new television and cinema advertisement to promote the seventh-generation Honda Accord line that had recently been rolled out in Europe and Japan. The advertisement, based around a complex chain reaction of moving parts from the Accord itself, { Wynne, Christopher; &quot; Interview with Matt Gooden and Ben Walker &quot;, Advertising, 28 May 2004. } was approved and given the working title &quot; Cog &quot;. [ Pre-production ] Gooden and Walker had been working together since 1988. By 2002, their portfolio included a Guinness World Record -holding one-second advertisement produced for Leo Burnett Worldwide, and a depression -awareness booklet for the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust. { Parpis, Eleftheria; &quot; Ben Walker On The Spot &quot;, } { Adweek, 21 June 2004. Retrieved 2 August 2009, via AllBusiness.com. } The pair approached Honda with a rough, low-budget 30-second trial film { Austin, Suzy; &quot; Perfect on the 606th take &quot;, } { Metro, 2003. Retrieved 6 September 2009. } inspired by the children&apos;s board game Mouse Trap, Caractacus Potts &apos; breakfast-making machine in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and a 1987 Swiss art film by Peter Fischli and David Weiss, Der Lauf der Dinge ( The Way Things Go ). The Honda executives were intrigued, but demanded a cut using actual automotive parts before giving permission to go ahead with the full-scale project. { Anderson, Mae; &quot; How to Sell a Strange Idea &quot;, } { Adweek, July 14, 2003. Retrieved March 27, 2011. } &quot; Cog &quot; was approved with a budget of £1  million, and Gooden &amp; Walker recruited a London-based team to go through the logistics of the shoot in detail. The team, which comprised engineers, special effect s technicians, car designers, and even a sculptor, spent a month working with parts from a disassembled Honda Accord before the design for the advertisement&apos;s set was even finalised. { &quot; The new Honda Accord – isn&apos;t it nice when things just... work? &quot;, } { The Guardian, 9 May 2003. Retrieved 2 September 2009. } Approval for the script took another month. Honda insisted that several specific Accord features, such as a door with a wing-mirror indicator and a rain-sensitive windscreen, appear in the final cut. The company planned to highlight these features in sales brochures. { Lucas, Gavin; &quot; Disassembly Line &quot;, Creative Review, 1 April 2003. } Antoine Bardou-Jacquet was hired to direct the piece. Bardou-Jacquet was mostly known for directing several award-winning music video s, including Alex Gopher&apos;s &quot; The Child &quot;, Playgroup &apos;s &quot; Number One &quot;, and Air &apos;s &quot; How Does It Make You Feel &quot;. { &quot; Profile: Antoine Bardou-Jacquet &quot;, Partizan. Retrieved 26 July 2009. } { &quot; Awards: Antoine Bardou-Jacquet &quot;, Partizan. Retrieved 2 August 2009. } [ Filming ] Bardou-Jacquet wanted to compose the advertisement with as little computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. { Hardstaff, Johnny; &quot; The Impossibly Real: Green Belting the Imaginary &quot;, } { Animation: An Interdisciplinary Journal, July 2007 vol. 2 no. 2 pp. 187-201. } To this end, he set two months aside for the creation of hundreds { Wakelin, Simon; &quot; Cognizant kinetics &quot;, } { Boards, 1 June 2003. Retrieved 2 August 2009. } of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed. The final cut of &quot; Cog &quot; consists of two continuous sixty-second dolly shots taken from a technocrane, stitched together later in post-production. (The stitching appears during the moment when the muffler rolls across the floor.) { &quot; Classic Ad: Honda ‘Cog’ &quot;, } { The New York Times, 31 December 2009. Retrieved 13 March 2010. } Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section. Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second. { Boyer, Trevor; &quot; Practical Motion &quot;, Millimeter, 1 August 2003. } Between testing and filming, 606   take s were needed to capture the final cut. The team commandeered two of Honda&apos;s six hand-assembled Accords —one to roll off the trailer at the end of the advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts. While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries. [ Post-production ] &quot; Cog &quot; needed only limited post-production work, as the decision had been made early on to eschew computer-generated imagery wherever possible. To further reduce the work required, &quot; Barnsley &quot;, a specialist in the Flame editing tool (real name, Andrew Wood), { &quot; The Mill Promotes Flame Artist Barnsley to Board &quot;, Broadcast, 9 July 1999. } from The Mill, spent a lot of time on set during filming, where he advised the film crew on whether particular sections could be accomplished more easily by re-filming or by manipulating the image afterwards. Even so, the constant movement of the components on-camera made it difficult to achieve a seamless transition between the two 60-second shots. Several sections also required minor video editing, such as re-centering the frame to stay closer to the action, removal of wires, highlighting a spray of water, and adjusting the pace for dramatic purposes. [ Release and reception ] [ Schedule ] &quot; Cog &quot; was first aired on British television on Sunday 6 April 2003. It filled an entire commercial break in ITV &apos;s coverage of the Brazilian Grand Prix. The release was widely remarked upon by the media, with articles appearing in both broadsheets such as The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, and The Guardian, { Cozens, Claire; Never work with cars, } { The Guardian, 15 April 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009. } and tabloid papers such as The Sun and The Daily Mirror. The day after &quot; Cog &quot; &apos;s debut, the Honda website received more hits than at any time in its history, and overnight became the second most-popular automotive website in the UK. The full 120-second version of the advertisement aired only 10 times in all, and only in the 10 days after the initial screening. The slots were chosen for maximum impact, mostly in high-profile sporting events such as the UEFA Champion&apos;s League football match between Manchester United and Real Madrid. The full version was then put aside in favour of a 60-second and five 30-second variations, which continued to air for a further six weeks. { Christie, Michael; &quot; Now that&apos;s a real motion picture &quot;, } { The Daily Record, 14 April 2003. } These shortened versions made use of newly introduced interactive options on the Sky Digital television network. Viewers were encouraged to press a button on their remote control, bringing up a menu that allowed the viewer to see the full 120-second version of the advertisement. Other menu options included placing an order for a free documentary DVD and a brochure for the Honda Accord. { Whitehead, Jennifer; &quot; Honda adds interactive element to epic £6m Accord ad &quot;, Brand Republic, 9 April 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009. } The DVD, which was also included as an insert in 1.2  million newspapers in the first week of the commercial&apos;s rollout, { &quot; Ad of the Week: Honda&apos;s Stunner &quot;, } { The Daily Telegraph, 1 April 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009. } contained a &quot; making-of &quot; documentary featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of the production process, a virtual tour of the Accord, the original music video to &quot; Rapper&apos;s Delight &quot; by the Sugarhill Gang, and an illustrated guide to all the parts shown in &quot; Cog &quot;. { Fera, Rae Ann; &quot; An idea deconstructed for Honda &quot;, } { Boards, 9 April 2003. Retrieved 6 September 2009. } The interactive 30-second versions of &quot; Cog &quot; proved hugely successful. Over 250,000 people used the menu option, spending an average of two and a half minutes in the dedicated advertising area. A significant number watched the looped 120-second version for up to ten minutes. Of those who opened the menu, 10,000 requested either a DVD or a brochure, and Honda used the data collected from the interactive option to arrange a number of test drive s. { &quot; Case Study: &quot; Cog &quot; &quot;, } { Thinkbox. Retrieved 3 September 2009. } Expansion of the &quot; Cog &quot; campaign to a worldwide market was fraught with a number of logistical difficulties. The cost of airing a 120-second commercial proved prohibitive in most markets. Combined with Honda&apos;s use of different advertising agencies in different regions and the relative autonomy of its various business unit s in marketing decisions, meant that &quot; Cog &quot; screened in only a few selected markets: the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia, and in cinemas in only a handful of other countries. For most markets, including the United States, the only way for audiences to see the piece was via the Internet, or in one of a handful of unsolicited and unpaid broadcasts on news channel review programmes. { &quot; The story of Honda &quot; Cog &quot;. &quot;, } { Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival (2003). } Traffic to Honda websites quadrupled; in the first few weeks, &quot; Cog &quot; was downloaded by over a million people. By mid-May, the number was twice that. { Battelle, John; &quot; Downloading the future of TV advertising &quot;, } { Business 2.0, July 2003, p. 46. } It has been estimated that more people in the United States voluntarily chose to watch &quot; Cog &quot; than any other Honda commercial. { Jaffe, Joseph; Life After the 30-Second Spot, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1 July 2005), p. 193. ISBN 978-0-471-71837-6 } In financial terms, &quot; Cog &quot; was an unprecedented success for Honda. The £32,000 spent on placements on the BSkyB network alone achieved a greater response than a previous £1  million direct mailing campaign. { Albaum, Gerald; Duerr, Edwin; International Marketing and Export Management (6th edition), Prentice Hall, 22 May 2008, p. 569. ISBN 978-0-273-71387-6 } Sales of Honda vehicles in the United Kingdom jumped by 28 percent, despite lower marketing and public relations spending by the company and an increase in prices relative to their competitors. Visits to Honda dealerships rose from an average of 3,500 to 3,700 per month, with 22 percent of these resulting in the purchase of a Honda, compared to 19 percent before the campaign. In all, &quot; Cog &quot; has been credited with increasing Honda&apos;s revenue by nearly £400m. { Earls, Mark; Herd: How to Change Mass Behaviour by Harnessing Our True Nature, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 24 August 2009, p. 274. ISBN 978-0-470-68548-8 } [ Plagiarism accusations ] Shortly after Cog appeared on television, Wieden+Kennedy received a letter from Peter Fischli and David Weiss, creators of the 1987 art film Der Lauf der Dinge. The film was well known in the advertising industry, and its creators had been approached several times with offers for the right to use the concept, but had always declined. The letter pointed out several similarities between their work and &quot; Cog &quot;, and warned the agency that they were considering legal action on the basis of the &quot; commercialisation and simplification of the film&apos;s content and the false impression that [they] might have endorsed the use &quot;. { Bently, Lionel; Davis, Jennifer; Ginsburg, Jane C.; Copyright and Piracy: An Interdisciplinary Critique, } { Cambridge University Press, 28 October 2010, p. 329. ISBN 978-0-521-19343-6 } When interviewed by Creative Review magazine, the pair made clear that they wished they had been consulted on the advertisement, and that they would not have given permission if asked. { Beard, Matthew; &quot; Artists claim Honda copied their film in TV cog advert &quot;, } { The Independent, 28 May 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009. } Media publications quickly picked up the story, and asserted that Fischli and Weiss were already in the process of litigation against the car manufacturer. { Cozens, Claire; &quot; Spanner in the Works &quot;, } { The Guardian, 28 May 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009. } { Hazlehurst, Jeremy; &quot; Art of the Big Steal &quot;, } { The Times, 1 August 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009. } Comparisons were made between the case and that of Mehdi Norowzian, a British director who complained about Diageo &apos;s, the drinks conglomerate, for allegedly plagiarising his work in their 1994 Anticipation campaign for Guinness -brand stout. { &quot; Mills, Dominic; Art for ad&apos;s sake is a copyright fight &quot;, } { The Daily Telegraph, 3 June 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2009. } The matter was complicated by the fact that Wieden+Kennedy acknowledged that the film had served as an &quot; inspiration &quot; for &quot; Cog &quot;, and had distributed copies of the work to its script-writers. Ultimately, Fischli and Weiss did not file a lawsuit against either Wieden+Kennedy or Honda UK. [ Awards ] Gold – Best Commercial Gold – Best Campaign or Series With Sense and Everyday.

Voted second was a British ad, &quot; Ear Tennis &quot; for the Xbox video game console.

The first of these was Just Works, a deliberate parody advertisement for the 118 118 directory assistance service in the summer of 2003, in which the Honda parts are replaced with such oddities as a tractor wheel, a flamingo and a space hopper, with impetus provided by two moustachioed runners. { &quot; Watch WCRS&apos;s spoof of Honda&apos;s &apos;cog&apos; ad &quot;, Brand Republic, 20 June 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2009. (via Mediaweek). } Just Works was created by advertising agency WCRS. It was written by Anson Harris and directed by JJ Keith, { Sweney, Mark; &quot; Honda blocks airing of WCRSs spoof Cog ad &quot;, } { Campaign, 13 June 2003.

Retrieved 7 September 2009. } Honda refused to give WCRS permission to copy their advert, which, under BACC guidelines, prevented either the 60- or 90-second Just Works spots from appearing on British television. Instead, the ad was shown online and promoted virally. { Whitehead, Jennifer; &quot; The Number hires agency to redesign 118 118 site &quot;, Brand Republic, 11 July 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2009. } Just Works went on to win a number of awards in its own right, including Golds in several categories at the British Television Advertising Awards and the Creative Circle Awards, a Silver Lion from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, and a Bronze award from The One Show. In 2004, BBC Radio Manchester asked for and received permission from Wieden+Kennedy to produce a television advertisement in the style of &quot; Cog &quot; to advertise coverage of football events by local radio stations. The ad, which was directed by Reg Sanders and produced by Tracy Williams, shows pieces of sports equipment such as footballs and team shirts knocking into each other in sequence. In all, 65  versions were broadcast, each tailored to advertise the local BBC Radio station. Wieden+Kennedy were pleased to gain the extra publicity and Neil Christie, managing director of Wieden+Kennedy London, commented: &quot; We are very happy that every time the BBC runs one of their adverts, the person who watches it thinks of Honda. &quot; &apos;&apos;Campaign&apos;&apos; magazine listed &quot; Cog &quot;, along with Balls for the Sony BRAVIA line of high-definition television s, as one of the most-imitated commercials in recent times. { Bussey, Noel; &quot; Advertising: is it just a load of cog and balls? &quot;, } { Campaign 15 February 2008.

The fact the TV ad was only part of a huge internet campaign meant that I thought it wasn’t that near &quot; Cog &quot;. &quot; [ Outside advertising ] &quot; Cog &quot; has also inspired a number of other creative endeavours outside of the advertising industry, including an elaborate domino -toppling world record attempt by Robin Weijers, { &quot; &apos;Dead&apos; Dutchman will recreate Honda&apos;s &apos;cog&apos; for true domino effect &quot;, } { Campaign, 19 September 2003.

Deliberate steps were taken to distance the spot from &quot; Cog &quot;, using metaphor to make the promotion, rather than focusing on the technology itself. { Eastwood, Allison; &quot; Apres-cog &quot;, } { Boards, 3 July 2003.
