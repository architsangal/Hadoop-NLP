Cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty under the auspices of the Soviet Union were generally honored by burial at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow. It is unknown whether this remains tradition for Russia, since the Kremlin Wall Necropolis was largely a Communist honor and no cosmonauts have died in action since the Soviet Union fell. There have been four fatal in-flight accidents on missions which were considered spaceflights under the internationally accepted definition of the term, plus one on the ground during rehearsal of a planned flight. In each case all crew were killed. To date, there has never been an incident where an individual member of a multi-member crew has died during (or while rehearsing) a mission.

The Space Shuttle &apos;&apos;Challenger&apos;&apos; was destroyed 73 seconds after lift-off on STS-51-L. Analysis of the accident showed that a faulty O-ring seal had allowed hot gases from the shuttle solid rocket booster (SRB) to weaken the external propellant tank, and also the strut that held the booster to the tank. The tank aft region failed, causing it to begin disintegrating. The SRB strut also failed, causing the SRB to rotate inward and expedite tank breakup. Challenger was thrown sideways into the Mach 1.8 windstream causing it to break up in midair with the loss of all seven crew members aboard. NASA investigators determined they may have survived during the spacecraft disintegration, while possibly unconscious from hypoxia; at least some of them tried to protect themselves by activating their emergency oxygen. Any survivors of the breakup were killed, however, when the largely intact cockpit hit the water at 200  mph (320  km/h). The vehicle impacted the water about 20 miles (32  km) east of Cape Canaveral. &quot; Tracking reported that the vehicle had exploded and impacted the water in an area approximately located at 28.64 degrees north, 80.28 degrees west &quot;, Mission Control, Houston.

Damage to the shuttle&apos;s thermal protection system (TPS) led to structural failure in the shuttle&apos;s left wing and, ultimately, the spacecraft broke apart. Investigations after the tragedy revealed the damage to the reinforced carbon-carbon leading edge wing panel had resulted from a piece of insulation foam breaking away from the external tank during the launch and hitting shuttle&apos;s wing.

Bondarenko was in training in a special low-pressure chamber with a pure oxygen atmosphere. He threw an alcohol-soaked cloth onto an electric hotplate. In the pure oxygen environment, the fire quickly engulfed the entire chamber. Bondarenko suffered third-degree burns over most of his body and face and was barely alive when the chamber was opened, and died of his burns shortly after being hospitalized. Bondarenko&apos;s death was covered up by the Soviet government; word of his death only reached the West in 1986. Many materials become explosively flammable when exposed to oxygen with a higher partial pressure than that of air at STP; modern spacecraft use mixtures of continuously replaced oxygen and nitrogen. It has been speculated that knowledge of Bondarenko&apos;s death might have led to changes that would have prevented the Apollo 1 fire. &quot; Soviets admint cosmonaut&apos;s death &quot;, Wilmington, NC - Morning Star newspaper, Apr 7, 1986 Training jet crash Theodore Freeman Freeman was on landing approach to Ellington AFB near Houston, TX. He ultimately died due to a goose smashing the left side of the cockpit canopy of his T-38 jet trainer. Flying shards of Plexiglas entered the engine intake and caused both engines to flame out. The astronaut attempted to continue the landing approach with flamed out engines, but then attempted to steer the troubled aircraft away from buildings at Ellington and toward an open field, when the aircraft could not make it to the runway. Freeman ejected from the stricken aircraft, but was too close to the ground at that point for his parachute to open properly. Freeman was found, dead, about 90 meters from the crashed aircraft. &quot; Crash Kills Astronaut &quot;, Richland, WA - Tri City Herald, Nov. 1, 1964 &quot; Goose Hit Jet, Killing Astronaut &quot;, The Miami News, Nov. 17, 1964 The creation of zero-zero ejection seat s has eliminated this problem.

He radioed a distress mayday and crashed on a plantation near Miccosukee, Florida, about 15 miles north of Tallahassee, Florida, near the Georgia border. The aircraft dove straight down, between pine trees 30 meters apart, and crashed without touching them, although it did singe them from a fire caused by the crash. The plane disintegrated, according to an Air Force spokesman. &quot; Williams Wanted To Be First On The Moon &quot;, St. Petersburg, FL - Evening Independent newspaper, Oct. 6, 1967 Williams died after a mechanical failure caused the aileron controls to jam on his T-38. The jet was flying at 6,800 meters when it performed a sudden roll to the left and dove into the ground, almost straight down, at 1,125  km/h. Williams ejected at 450 meters altitude, but at that speed and altitude, the parachute did not open properly. &quot; Board Pinpoints Astronaut&apos;s Death &quot;, Sarasota, FL - Herald-Tribune newspaper, Jun. 7, 1968 He had been assigned to the back-up crew for what would be the Apollo 9 mission and would have most likely been assigned as Lunar Module pilot for Apollo 12.

Training jet crash Robert Lawrence Lawrence was named the first African-American astronaut for the U.S. Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory program, but he never made it into space. He died when his F-104 Starfighter jet crashed at Edwards Air Force Base, California.Major Lawrence, 32, was in the final two weeks of the MOL pilot training course. He was completing a proficiency test flight along with Major Harvey Royer, Chief of Operations of the USAF ARP School. Royer was flying as pilot in the front seat and Lawrence was copilot in the rear seat. The crew were practicing a series of very high speed, quick descent landing profiles, used by lifting bodies and the X-15, when the accident occurred. The aircraft hit the runway hard and the landing gear collapsed, the aircraft belly was on fire and the canopy shattered. The aircraft skidded along the runway for 60 meters and took to the air again for 550 meters. Both crewmen ejected. Royer survived, but was seriously injured. Lawrence was found in the ejection seat, 70 meters from the crashed aircraft, with his parachute unopened; he was killed upon impact with the ground. &quot; Disasters and Accidents In Manned Spaceflight, By David Shayler; pgs 84, 85 &quot;, Published by Springer, 2000 &quot; Air Crash Kills Astro &quot;, Nashua, NH - Telegraph newspaper, Dec. 9, 1967 Training jet crash Yuri Gagarin The first human in space died when his MiG-15UTI jet trainer crashed while he prepared for the Soyuz 3 mission. &quot; Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin Dies in Training-Flight Crash &quot;, The Southeast Missourian newspaper, Mar. 26, 1968 An official report at the time blamed either birdstrike or that he turned too fast to avoid something in the air. But in 2003 it came to light that the KGB had found that the official report was false and that the truth was negligence by an air force colonel on the ground, who gave an out-of-date weather report; the flight needed good weather and the aircraft not to have external extra fuel tanks, but the cloud base was nearly at ground level and the aircraft had external fuel tanks under its wings. Since Gagarin was a very public figure, the Soviet government decided that it would be bad publicity to have him killed in a mere training accident and so several newspapers printed the report that he actually died heroically testing a top-secret prototype. This again led to speculation amongst Western conspiracy-proponents as to whether Gagarin had instead died in hushed-up spacecraft accident (see Lost cosmonauts ).The crash site coordinates are, which is 18  km South East of Kirzhach and 3  km South West of Novoselovo in the Vladimirskaya oblast of the Russian Federation.This is about 90  km North East of Moscow. There is an obelisk style monument at the site withprofiles of Gagarin and Seryogin engraved on the side of it. Drowned during water recovery training Sergei Vozovikov Sergei Yuriyevich Vozovikov was a member of the Soviet Air Force Cosmonaut Training Group 11. His Cosmonaut training was from 1 October 1991 to 6 March 1992. He drowned 11 July 1993 during water recovery training in the Black Sea, near Rayon Anapa, Russia. &quot; Vozovikov &quot;, Encyclopedia Astronautica [ Percentage of fatal spaceflights ] There are various ways of measuring the danger of spaceflight based on comparing the number of fatalities to the number of non-fatal spaceflights. About two percent of the manned launch/reentry attempts have killed their crew, with Soyuz and the Shuttle having almost the same death percentage rates. Except for the X-15 (which is a suborbital rocket plane ), other launchers have not launched sufficiently often for reasonable safety comparisons to be made. About five percent of the people that have been launched have died doing so. [ 2004 11 ], 439 individuals have flown on spaceflights: Russia/Soviet Union (96), USA (277), others (66). [ March 2010 ] Twenty-two have died while in a spacecraft: three on Apollo 1, one on Soyuz 1, one on X-15-3, three on Soyuz 11, seven on Challenger, and seven on Columbia. By space program, 18 NASA astronauts (4.1%) and four Russian cosmonauts (0.9% of all the people launched) died while in a spacecraft. [ 2010 12 ] Soyuz accidents have claimed the lives of four cosmonauts. No deaths have occurred on Soyuz missions since 1971, and none with the current design of the Soyuz. Including the early Soyuz design, the average deaths per launched crew member on Soyuz are currently under two percent. However, there have also been several serious injuries, and some other incidents in which crews nearly died. [ Non-fatal incidents during spaceflight ] Apart from actual disasters, a number of missions resulted in some very near misses and also some training accidents that nearly resulted in deaths. In-flight near misses have included various reentry mishaps (in particular on Soyuz 5 ), the sinking of the Mercury 4 capsule, and the Voskhod 2 crew spending a night in dense forest surrounded by wolves.

After his twelve minutes outside, Leonov&apos;s spacesuit had inflated in the vacuum to the point where he could not reenter the airlock. He opened a valve to allow some of the suit&apos;s pressure to bleed off, and was barely able to get back inside the capsule after suffering slight effects of the bends. Because the spacecraft was so cramped, the crew could not keep to their reentry schedule and landed 386 km off course in deep forest. They had to spend a night in their capsule due to the danger of bears and wolves. 1966 March 17: equipment failure: Gemini 8 : A maneuvering thruster refused to shut down and put their capsule into an uncontrolled spin.

The service module broke away before the capsule would have been destroyed, and so it made a rough but survivable landing far off course in the Ural mountains. 1969 Nov 14 : Struck twice by lightning during launch : Astronauts Pete Conrad, Alan Bean and Dick Gordon experienced two lightning strikes during the launch of the Apollo 12 moon landing mission. The first strike, at 36 seconds after liftoff, knocked the three fuel cells offline and the craft switched to battery power automatically. The second strike at 52 seconds after liftoff, knocked the onboard guidance platform offline. Four temperature sensors on the outside of the Lunar Module were burnt out and four measuring devices in the reaction control system failed temporarily.

The center engine shut down two minutes early. The remaining engines on the second and third stages were burned a total of 34 seconds longer. It was later determined that the shut down was caused by pogo vibrations of the rocket. Had the pogo continued, however, it could have torn the Saturn V apart. &quot; Third U.S. lunar mission leaves pad without hitch &quot;, Eugene, OR - Register-Guard newspaper, Apr 11, 1970 &quot; Apollo 13 on way after engine fails &quot;, The Age newspaper, Apr 13, 1970 &quot; Apollo 14 Tests Wait For Month &quot;, Youngstown Vindicator newspaper, Apr 29, 1970 1970 April 13: equipment failure: In the most celebrated &quot; near miss, &quot; the Apollo 13 crew came home safely after a violent rupture of a liquid oxygen tank NASA&apos;s official report ( REPORT OF APOLLO 13 REVIEW BOARD ) does not use the word &quot; explosion &quot; in describing the tank failure. Rupture disks and other safety measures were present to prevent a catastrophic explosion, and analysis of pressure readings and subsequent ground-testing determined that these safety measures worked as designed. See findings 26 and 27 on page 195 (5-22) of the NASA report. deprived the Service Module of its ability to produce electrical power, crippling their spacecraft en route to the moon. They survived the loss of use of their command ship by relying on the Lunar Module as a &quot; life boat &quot; to provide life support and power for the trip home. &quot; Magnitude Of Apollo 13 Damage Astounded Crew &quot;, Lodi, CA News-Sentinel, Apr. 18, 1970 1971, Aug 7 : One of three main parachutes failed : During descent, the three main parachutes of Apollo 15 opened successfully. However, when the remaining reaction control system fuel was jettisoned, one parachute was damaged by the discarded fuel causing it to collapse. The Apollo 15 and its crew still splashed down safely, at a slightly higher than normal velocity, on the two remaining main parachutes. If a second parachute had failed, the spacecraft would probably have been crushed on impact with the ocean, according to a NASA official. &quot; Rocket Fuel Gets Blame In Apollo Parachute Fluke &quot;, Lumberton, NC - The Robesonian newspaper, Aug 13, 1971 1975 April 5: separation failure: The Soyuz 18a mission nearly ended in disaster when the rocket suffered a second-stage separation failure during launch. This also interrupted the craft&apos;s attitude, causing the vehicle to accelerate towards the Earth and triggering an emergency reentry sequence. Due to the downward acceleration, the crew experienced an acceleration of 21.3 g rather than the nominal 15 g for an abort. Upon landing, the vehicle rolled down a hill and stopped just short of a high cliff. The crew survived, but Lazarev, the mission commander, suffered internal injuries due to the severe G-forces and was never able to fly again. 1975 July 24: gas poisoning on board: During final descent and parachute deployment for the Apollo Soyuz Test Project Command Module, the U.S. crew were exposed to 300 µL/L of toxic nitrogen tetroxide gas (Reaction Control System oxidizer ) venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. A switch was left in the wrong position. 400µL/L is fatal. Vance Brand&apos;s heart stopped and he was narrowly resuscitated. The crew members suffered from burning sensations of their eyes, faces, noses, throats and lungs. Thomas Stafford quickly broke out emergency oxygen masks and put one on Brand and gave one to Deke Slayton. The crew were exposed to the toxic gas from 24,000  ft (7.3  km) down to landing. About an hour after landing the crew developed chemical-induced pneumonia and their lungs had edema. They experienced shortness of breath and were hospitalized in Hawaii. The crew spent two weeks in the hospital. By July 30, their chest X-rays appeared to return to normal. &quot; Brand Takes Blame For Apollo Gas Leak &quot;, Florence, AL - Times Daily newspaper, Aug. 10, 1975 1976 October 16: landing capsule sank in water: The Soyuz 23 capsule broke through the surface of a frozen lake and was dragged underwater by its parachute. The crew was saved after a very difficult rescue operation. &quot; Cosmonauts Land in Lake, Blizzard &quot;, Milwaukee Journal newspaper, Oct 18, 1976 1979 April 12 : engine malfunction: Soyuz 33 was the ninth mission to the Salyut 6 orbiting facility, but an engine failure forced the mission to be aborted, and the crew had to return to earth before docking with the station. It was the first-ever failure of a Soyuz engine during orbital operations. The two-man crew, commander Nikolai Rukavishnikov and Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov, suffered a steep ballistic re-entry, but were safely recovered. The original intention of the mission had been to visit the orbiting crew for about a week and leave a fresh vehicle for the station crew to return to earth in. The mission failure meant that the orbiting Salyut 6 crew lacked a reliable return vehicle as their Soyuz had the same suspect engine as Soyuz 33. A subsequent manned flight was canceled and a vacant craft with a redesigned engine was sent for the crew to use.&apos;&apos; 1981 Apr 12 : Columbia STS-1 - Unexpectedly high SRB ignition shock wave overpressure reached design limits of orbiter structure : Solid Rocket Booster ignition shock wave overpressure was four times greater than expected (2.0 psi measured vs 0.5 psi predicted) on STS-1. Some of the Columbia Space Shuttle Orbiter aft structures reached their design limits (2.0 psi) from the overpressure. The overpressure bent four struts that supported two RCS fuel tanks in the nose of Columbia and the locked elevon control flap on the wing was pushed up and down 6  inches by the shock wave. John Young and Robert Crippen in the crew cabin received a 3g jolt from the shock wave. A water spray shock wave damping system had to be installed on the launch pad prior to the STS-2 launch. &quot; Shock Wave Doesn&apos;t Worry Shuttle Crew &quot;, Toledo Blade newspaper, Sep 16, 1981 &quot; Shuttle shock wave problem still puzzles NASA &quot;, Richland, WA - Tri-City Herald newspaper, Sep 11, 1981 &quot; Shuttle&apos;s Pressure Problem Studied &quot;, Toledo Blade newspaper, Jun 27, 1981 &quot; Space Shuttle Columbia Nears Second Flight &quot;, Sarasota Herald Tribune newspaper, Oct 25, 1981 1983 September 26: fire in launch vehicle: A Soyuz crew was saved by their escape system when the rocket that was to carry their Soyuz T-10-1 mission into space caught fire on the launchpad. 1983 Dec 8 : leaked APU hydrazine fuel fire and explosion : In the last two minutes of the Columbia STS-9 mission, during the final approach to the Edwards AFB runway, hydrazine fuel leaked onto two of the three onboard APU&apos;s (auxiliary power units) hot surfaces in the aft compartment of the shuttle and caught fire. About 15 minutes after landing, hydrazine fuel trapped in APU control valves exploded, destroying the valves in both APU&apos;s. The fire also damaged nearby wiring. The fire stopped when the supply of leaked fuel was exhausted. All of this was discovered the next day when technicians removed a shuttle rear panel and discovered the area blackened and scorched. It is believed that hydrazine leaked in orbit and froze, stopping the leak. After returning, the leak restarted and ignited when combined with oxygen from the atmosphere. There were no injuries during the incident. &quot; Fuel Devices on Space Shuttle Were on Fire During Landing &quot;, Schenectady Gazette newspaper, Dec 12, 1983 &quot; Engineers Study Blaze Aboard Columbia &quot;, Ocala Star-Banner newspaper, Dec 14, 1983 1985 July 29: STS-51-F : Space Shuttle in-flight engine failure: Five minutes, 45 seconds into ascent, one of three main engines aboard Challenger shut down prematurely due to a spurious high temperature reading. At about the same time, a second main engine almost shut down from a similar problem, but this was observed and inhibited by a fast acting flight controller. The failed SSME resulted in an Abort To Orbit (ATO) trajectory, whereby the shuttle achieves a lower than planned orbital altitude. Had the second engine failed within about 20 seconds of the first, a Transatlantic Landing (TAL) abort might have been necessary. No bailout option existed until after mission STS-51-L, the Challenger disaster. But even with that option, a bailout (a &quot; contingency abort &quot; ) would never be considered when an &quot; intact abort &quot; option exists, and after five minutes of normal flight it would always exist unless a serious flight control failure or some other major problem beyond engine shutdown occurred. http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_mes.html#mes_ascent ) &quot; Shuttle OK after close call &quot;, Meriden, CT - Record-Journal newspaper, Jul 30, 1985 1988 September 6: sensor failure: At the end of Mir EP-3, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and Afghan cosmonaut Abdul Ahad Mohmand undocked from Mir in the spacecraft Soyuz TM-5. During descent they suffered a computer software problem combined with a sensor problem. The deorbit engine on the TM-5 spacecraft which was to propel them into atmospheric reentry, did not behave as expected. During an attempted burn, the computer shut off the engines prematurely, believing the spacecraft was out of alignment. Lyakhov determined that they were not, in fact, out of alignment, and asserted that the problem was caused by conflicting signals picked up by the alignment sensors caused by solar glare. With the problem apparently solved, two orbits later he restarted to deorbit engines. But the engines shut off again. The flight director decided that they would have to remain in orbit an extra day (a full revolution of the Earth), so they could determine what the problem was. During this time it was realised that during the second attempted engine burn, the computer had tried to execute the program which was used to dock with Mir several months earlier during EP-2. After reprogramming the computer, the next attempt was successful, and the crew safely landed on 7 September. 1991 April 8: STS-37 : spacesuit puncture: During an extravehicular activity on STS-37, a small rod (palm bar) in a glove of EV2 astronaut Jay Apt &apos;s extravehicular mobility unit punctured the suit. Somehow, the astronaut&apos;s hand conformed to the puncture and sealed it, preventing any detectable depressurization. http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-37/mission-sts-37.html During postflight debriefings Apt said after the second EVA, when he removed the gloves, his right hand index finger had an abrasion behind the knuckle. A postflight inspection of the right hand glove found the palm bar of the glove penetrating a restraint and glove bladder into the index finger side of the glove. NASA found air leakage with the bar in place was 3.8 sccm vs a specification of 8.0 sccm. They said if the bar had come out of the hole, the leak still would not have been great enough to activate the secondary oxygen pack. The suit would, however, have shown a high oxygen rate indication. &quot; STS-37 Space Shuttle Mission Report May 1991 - NASA-CR-193062 &quot;, Extravehicular Activity Evaluation, Page 16, accessed online 4 Jan, 2011 1993 Sep 12 : explosive release device punctures cargo bay bulkhead : Aboard shuttle Discovery, during the STS-51 mission, while releasing the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite from the cargo bay, both the primary and backup explosive release devices detonated. Only the primary device was supposed to have detonated. Large metal bands holding the satellite in place were ripped away causing flying debris. The debris punctured the shuttle cargo bay bulkhead leading to the main engine compartment, damaging wiring trays and payload bay thermal insulation blankets. The puncture in the bulkhead was 3  mm by 13  mm in size. The crew was uninjured and the damage was not great enough to endanger the shuttle. The satellite was undamaged. &quot; Damage suffered by space shuttle &quot;, Portsmouth, OH - Daily Times newspaper, Oct 8, 1993 1995 May 18 : eye injury from Mir exercise equipment : While exercising on the Mir EO-18/NASA 1/ Soyuz TM-21 mission, astronaut Norman E. Thagard suffered an eye injury. He was using an exercise device, doing deep knee bends, with elastic straps. One of the straps slipped off of his foot, flew up, and hit him in the eye. Later, even a small amount of light caused pain in his eye. He said using the eye was, &quot; like looking at the world through gauze. &quot; An ophthalmologist at Mission Control-Moscow prescribed steroid drops and the eye healed. &quot; NASA-1 Norm Thagard: An Ending and a Beginning &quot;, NASA History.Gov website, accessed online Jan 27, 2011 1997 February 23: fire on board: There was a fire on board the Mir space station when a lithium perchlorate canister used to generate oxygen leaked. The fire was extinguished after about 90 seconds, but smoke did not clear for several minutes. 1997 June 25: collision in space: At Mir during a re-docking test with the Progress-M 34 cargo freighter, the Progress freighter collided with the Spektr module and solar arrays of the Mir space station. This damaged the solar arrays and the collision punctured a hole in the Spektr module and the space station began depressurizing. The onboard crew of two Russians and one visiting NASA astronaut were able to close off the Spektr module from the rest of Mir after quickly cutting cables and hoses blocking hatch closure. 1999 July 23: STS-93 : main engine electrical short and hydrogen leak: Five seconds after liftoff, an electrical short knocked out controllers for two shuttle main engines. The engines automatically switched to their backup controllers. Had a further short shut down two engines, Columbia would have ditched in the ocean, although the crew could have possibly bailed out. Concurrently a pin came loose inside one engine and ruptured a cooling line, allowing a hydrogen fuel leak. This caused premature fuel exhaustion, but the vehicle safely achieved a slightly lower orbit. Had the failure propagated further, a risky transatlantic or RTLS abort would have been required. 2001 Feb 10 : STS-98 / ISS - toxic ammonia leak during EVA : During EVA 1 on the Atlantis STS-98 mission, NASA astronauts Robert L. Curbeam and Thomas D. Jones were connecting cooling lines on the International Space Station while working to install the Destiny Laboratory Module. A defective quick-disconnect valve allowed 5% of the ammonia cooling supply to escape into space. The escaping ammonia froze on the spacesuit of astronaut Curbeam as he struggled to close the valve. His helmet and suit were coated in toxic ammonia crystals an inch thick. Mission Control instructed Curbeam to remain outside for an entire orbit to allow the Sun to evaporate the frozen ammonia from his spacesuit. When they returned to the airlock, the astronauts pressurized, vented and then repressurized the air lock to purge any remaining toxic ammonia. After they removed their spacesuits, the crew wore oxygen masks for another 20 minutes to allow life-support systems in the airlock to further filter the air. No injuries resulted from the incident. &quot; A Toxic Leak Haunts the Shuttle Crew &quot;, New York Times, December 16, 2006 2003 May 3: ballistic reentry, injured shoulder: The Soyuz TMA-1 capsule had a malfunction during its return to Earth from the ISS Expedition 6 mission and performed a ballistic reentry. The crew was subjected to about 8 to 9 G&apos;s during reentry. The capsule landed 500  km from the intended landing target. In addition, after landing the capsule was dragged about 15 meters by its parachute and ended up on its side in a hard landing. Astronaut Don Pettit injured his shoulder and was placed on a stretcher in a rescue helicopter and did not take part in post-landing ceremonies. &quot; Moscow, we have a problem: our spacecraft is lost &quot;, The London Sunday Times newspaper, May 5, 2003 &quot; Soyuz misses its mark but still finds Earth safely &quot;, USA Today newspaper, May 4, 2003 2004 Sep 29 : 29 unplanned rolls during ascent : While piloting SpaceShipOne on suborbital flight 16P, the first of two flights that won the X-Prize for exceeding 100  km in altitude, astronaut Mike Melvill experienced 29 unplanned rolls during and after powered ascent. The rolls began at 50 seconds into the engine burn. The burn was stopped 11 seconds early after burning a total of 76 seconds. After engine cutoff, the craft continued rolling while coasting to apogee. The roll was finally brought under control after apogee using the crafts reaction jets. SpaceShipOne landed safely and Mike Melvill was uninjured. &quot; Private rocket plane goes rolling into space &quot;, The Southeast Missourian newspaper, Sep 30, 2004 &quot; SpaceShipOne Rolling Rumors: Rutan Sets the Record Straight &quot;, Space.com website - posted: 02 October 2004, accessed online 4 Jan, 2011 2008 April 19: Soyuz TMA-11 suffered a reentry mishap similar to that suffered by Soyuz 5 in 1969.
