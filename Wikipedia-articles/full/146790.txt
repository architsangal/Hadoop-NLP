The term implies widely different responsibilities in different countries, from being a heavily armed military force with customs and security duties to being a volunteer organization tasked with search and rescue functions and lacking any law enforcement powers. However, a typical coast guard&apos;s functions distinct from typical functions of both the navy (a pure military force) and a transportation police (a mere law enforcement agency). [ Role ] Among the responsibilities that may be entrusted to a coast guard service are: search and rescue, enforcement of maritime law, safety of vessels, maintenance of seamark s and border control During wartime, some coast guard organizations might have responsibilities in harbor defense, port security, naval counter- intelligence and coastal patrols. The coast guard may, varying by jurisdiction, be part of the country&apos;s military, a law enforcement agency, or a search and rescue body. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard is a military branch with a law enforcement capacity, whereas the United Kingdom &apos;s Her Majesty&apos;s Coastguard is a civilian organisation whose only role is search and rescue. { http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/aboutus.htm } Most coast guards operate ship s and aircraft including helicopter s and seaplane s that are either owned or leased by the agency in order to fulfill their respective roles. Some coastguards, such as the Irish Coast Guard have only a very limited law enforcement role, usually in enforcing maritime safety law, such as by inspecting ships docked in their jurisdiction. { http://www.transport.ie/marine/IRCG/CGinformation/index.asp?lang=ENG &amp; loc=2076#gen } In cases where the coast guard is primarily concerned with coordinating rather than executing rescue operations, lifeboat s are often provided by civilian voluntary organizations, such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in the United Kingdom, whilst aircraft may be provided by the countries&apos; armed forces, such as Sea Kings [ November 2011 ] operated by the RAF and Royal Navy in addition to any of the coast guard&apos;s own assets. [ Type and role by country ] The following lists a select number of coast guards around the world, illustrating the varied roles they play in the respective countries they operate in: [ Argentina ] The Argentine Naval Prefecture, in Spanish Prefectura Naval Argentina or PNA, is a service of the Argentine Interior Ministry charged with protecting the country&apos;s rivers and maritime territory. It therefore fulfills the functions of other countries&apos; coast guards, and furthermore acts as a gendarmerie force policing navigable rivers. [ Australia ] While having 19,650 kilometres of coastline, Australia does not have a force purely to defend its coast. The duty of patrolling its coastline falls to the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Customs (through its Border Protection Command division), and the Police services of the states. In addition, there are several private volunteer coast guard organizations, the two largest organizations being the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol (established in 1937) and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (established in 1961). These volunteer organizations have no law enforcement powers, and are essentially auxiliary Search and Rescue services. [ Bangladesh ] [ Bangladesh Coast Guard ] The Bangladesh Coast Guard &apos;s officers are transferred from the Bangladesh Navy. While under the remit of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the coast guard is part of the country&apos;s military. { http://www.bdmilitary.com/index.php?option=com_content &amp; view=article &amp; id=110 &amp; Itemid=130 } [ Canada ] In Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) is a civilian service under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans responsible for patrolling the world&apos;s longest coastline of 243,042  km (~151,000  mi). { http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/coastline.html } The CCG holds responsibility for all marine search and rescue in Canada. The CCG coordinates search and rescue operations with the Canadian Forces, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other organizations. The CCG maintains and operates seamarks, coastal light stations, vessel traffic services, marine pollution response services, marine communications systems and provides icebreaking services. CCG also operates all federal scientific research and hydrographic survey vessels. To accomplish these tasks, CCG has a sizable fleet of vessels and aircraft, all serviced from various bases and smaller stations located on three coasts ( Atlantic, Arctic, Pacific ) and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. { http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/CCG/Mission } The Canadian Coast Guard College is located near Sydney, Nova Scotia. [ China (PRC) ] See article: Chinese Coast Guard The Peoples Republic of China operates several coast guard agencies. It is believed that in the near future, an integration of all these separate services would form a Chinese coast guard. In addition, these services operate their own small aviation units to assist their maritime patrol capabilities. The China Coast Guard (Simplified Chinese: 中国海警) serves as a coordinating body for maritime search and rescue in the territorial waters of the People&apos;s Republic of China. The China Coast Guard is the maritime branch of the Public Security Border Troops, a paramilitary police force under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). The China Maritime Safety Administration (Chinese: 中国海事局) is a government agency which coordinates maritime search and rescue in the territorial waters of the People&apos;s Republic of China. The CMSA is part of the Ministry of Transport. The China Marine Surveillance (CMS), created on 19 October 1998, is a paramilitary maritime law enforcement agency of the State Oceanic Administration of the People’s Republic of China. The force is responsible for enforcing laws and order within China’s territorial waters, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and shores, protect maritime environment, natural resources, navigation aids and other facilities, and carry out maritime surveys. In time of emergency, the force can also be deployed for other missions such as search and rescue. The China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command (FLEC)(Chinese: 中国渔政), an organ of the Fisheries Management Bureau under the PRC Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for the enforcement of laws concerning fishing and maritime resources within PRC’s territorial waters and exclusive economic zones (EEZ). FLEC’s responsibilities include protecting Chinese fishing vessels and personnel, resolving disputes in fishing activities, preventing illegal fishing, and protecting maritime resources. [ Taiwan (ROC) ] In Taiwan, the Coast Guard Administration (ROCCGA) is both a military and a law enforcement organization. The ROCCGA is considered a civilian law enforcement agency under the administration of the Executive Yuan, though during wartime it may be incorporated as part of the military. Its primary roles are in ensuring the safety and security of the country&apos;s waters and coordinating search and rescue efforts. { http://www.cga.gov.tw/EN/ } ROCCGA is instituted Maritime Patrol Directorate General and Coast Patrol Directorate General. Officers of Maritime Patrol Directorate General are law executors, but officers of Coast Patrol Directorate General are soldiers who have partial law-enforcement power. [ France ] [ Maritime Gendarmerie ] In France, Affaires maritimes is the closest organization to Coast Guards. In each region, a Naval Admiral, called Préfet Maritime, is in charge of coordination of all state services for action at sea ( Navy, Affaires maritimes, gendarmerie, customs, fishery survey...). The charity, Société Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer, provides most life saving duties at the local level. [ Germany ] [ German Federal Coast Guard ] The German Federal Coast Guard, known as the Küstenwache, is both a civilian service and a law enforcement organisation, staffed with both police officers and certain civilians from the various German federal agencies associated with maritime administration with responsibility for the coordination of all law enforcement activities within its jurisdiction. { http://www.kuestenwache.wsd-nord.de/index2.htm } [ Haiti ] [ Haitian Coast Guard ] The Haitian Coast Guard is an operational unit of the Haitian National Police. It is one of the few law enforcement organisations in the world to combine water policing and coast guard duties while remaining as a policing unit. It operates primarily as a law enforcement agency, with secondary responsibilities in search and rescue. [ Hong Kong ] In Hong Kong, law enforcement duties are carried out by the Marine Region of Hong Kong Police Force and the Customs and Excise Department. The Hong Kong Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (HKMRCC) co-ordinates search and rescue vessels, aircraft and other resources of the Fire Services Department, Government Flying Service, Marine Department and the Marine Police. [ Iceland ] [ Icelandic Coast Guard ] The Icelandic Coast Guard has primarily been a law enforcement organisation but is also in charge of national defences. It has also involved with Iceland&apos;s contributions to expeditionary operations and conducted military exercises. For example Operation Enduring Freedom and Northern Challenge. { http://www.lhg.is/english/icg/ } [ India ] [ Indian Coast Guard ] In India, the Indian Coast Guard is armed forces of union, under ministry of defence and, in contrast with some coast guard units, resembles a naval coastal defence force. It has responsibility for search and rescue, enforcement of maritime law- smuggling, immigration and shipping regulations- and protecting the country&apos;s maritime and offshore resources { http://www.indiancoastguard.nic.in/ } [ Ireland ] [ Irish Coast Guard ] The Irish Coast Guard (IRCG) makes up one arm of the Maritime Safety Services, the other being the Maritime Safety Directorate. Both arms are due to merge into a new &quot; one stop shop &quot; Agency for all maritime safety matters.The purpose of the Irish Coast Guard is:To reduce the loss of life within the Irish Search and Rescue Region and on rivers, lakes and waterways and to protect the quality of the marine environment within the Irish Pollution Responsibility Zone, Harbours and Maritime Local Authority areas and to preserve property.To promote safety standards, and by doing so, prevent, as far as possible, the loss of life at sea and on inland waters and other areas, and to provide an effective emergency response service &quot;.

It was formed to combat the rise of piracy in the Malaccan and Moluccan straits, especially after frequent attacks from the Orang laut pirate during the 1900s. Personnel often work very closely with the Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force. The Coast Guard operates a Special Forces Commando or STAR (Special Weapons and Tactics) unit, which was absorbed from the Navy&apos;s PASKAL and Air Force&apos;s PASKAU. The agency utilizes its resources in a maritime law enforcement and search and rescue capacity. { (P13) } [ Netherlands ] [ Netherlands Coastguard ] The Netherlands Coastguard (Nederlandse Kustwacht) is a national organisation responsible for various services along The Netherlands&apos; ocean coast line (mainly search and rescue services).
