Estuary English is a dialect of English widely spoken in South East England, especially along the River Thames and its estuary. Phonetician John C. Wells defines Estuary English as &quot; Standard English spoken with the accent of the southeast of England &quot;. [ http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/ee-faqs-jcw.htm Estuary English Q and A - JCW Phon.ucl.ac.uk 2010-08-16 ] The name comes from the area around the Thames, particularly London, Kent, north Surrey and south Essex. The variety first came to public prominence in an article by David Rosewarne in the Times Educational Supplement in October 1984. [ http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/rosew.htm Rosewarne, David (1984). &apos; &amp; #39;Estuary English&apos; &amp; #39;. Times Educational Supplement, 19 (October 1984) Phon.ucl.ac.uk 1999-05-21 2010-08-16 ] Rosewarne argued that it may eventually replace Received Pronunciation in the south-east. Studies have indicated that Estuary English is not a single coherent form of English; rather, the reality behind the construct consists of some (but not all) phonetic features of working-class London speech spreading at various rates socially into middle-class speech and geographically into other accents of south-eastern England. { A handout by } { John C.

Despite the similarity between the two dialects, the following characteristics of Cockney pronunciation are generally not considered to be present in Estuary English: [ http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/transcree.htm Wells, John (1994). &apos; &amp; #39;Transcribing Estuary English - a discussion document&apos; &amp; #39;.

However, Estuary English may use never in cases where not would be standard. For example, &quot; he did not &quot; [in reference to a single occasion] might become &quot; he never did &quot;. Replacement of [ɹ] with [ʋ] is not found in Estuary, and is also very much in decline amongst Cockney speakers. However, the boundary between Estuary English and Cockney is far from clear-cut, [ http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/maidment.htm Estuary English: Hybrid or Hype? Maidment J.

In particular, it has been suggested that &apos;&apos;th&apos;&apos;-fronting is &quot; currently making its way &quot; into Estuary English, for example those from Isle of Thanet often refer to Thanet as &quot; Plannit Fannit &quot; (Planet Thanet). [ Use ] Estuary English is widely encountered throughout the south and south-east of England, particularly among the young. Many consider it to be a working-class accent, though it is by no means limited to the working class. In the debate that surrounded a 1993 article about Estuary English, a London businessman claimed that Received Pronunciation was perceived as unfriendly, so Estuary English was now preferred for commercial purposes. { David Crystal, &quot; The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language &quot;, p.327 } Some people [ February 2012 ] adopt the accent as a means of &quot; blending in &quot;, appearing to be more working class, or in an attempt to appear to be &quot; a common man &quot; sometimes this affectation of the accent is derisively referred to as &quot; Mockney &quot;. A move away from traditional RP accents is almost universal among middle class young people. [ Crystal David RP and its successors http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/yourvoice/feature2_4.shtml BBC 12 April 2011 ] Conversely, Estuary English and the stronger London Accent are also seen [ January 2012 ] } in negative terms as unfriendly and portraying an unsympathetic urban manner. [ September 2011 ] Many people [ January 2012 ] in rural areas associate those accents with London and consider Londoners as the ultimate &quot; townies &quot; and as people sometimes with arrogant and inconsiderate attitudes and urban values, such as driving too fast in the country, being inconsiderate and impatient of slow moving traffic such as tractors, elderly drivers, cyclists and horse-riders in country lanes. [ September 2011 ] As a result, there is a tendency for people who would often speak with a London or Londonised accent to moderate or drop their urban accent to approximate with RP or rural accents in order to blend in with the &quot; rural man &quot; or the &quot; respectable man &quot; and even with the &quot; posh man &quot;. [ September 2011 ] The perception of appropriateness of &quot; blending in &quot; from RP: General/BBC or posh English or rural accents to London accents, or conversely, from London accents to rural or RP: General/BBC or posh accents is based on geography, location and the company they keep. Amongst their young friends, many young folk will speak in Estuary English and then with older colleagues and managers or in a posh neighbourhood or with &quot; aunty &quot;, they will speak in RP or rural accents. [ September 2011 ] The term &quot; Estuary English &quot; is sometimes used with pejorative connotation s : Sally Gunnell, a former Olympic athlete who became a television presenter for Channel 4 and the BBC, quit the BBC, announcing she felt &quot; very undermined &quot; by the network&apos;s lack of support after she was widely criticised for her &quot; uninspiring interview style &quot; and &quot; awful estuary English &quot;.

The spread of the London Accent extends many miles outside London and all of the neighbouring home counties surrounding London have residents who moved from London and took their London Accent with them. The London Accent or its Londonised milder variant, called “Estuary English”, can be heard in all of the New Town s, coastal resorts, and larger regional cities within 50 to 100 miles (80 to 160  km) of London in southern England.
