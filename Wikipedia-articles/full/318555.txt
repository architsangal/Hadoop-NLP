He captured two PGA Championship s for his only major titles, and played on four Ryder Cup teams. Diegel is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Diegel was born in Detroit, Michigan. He won his first significant event, the 1916 Michigan Open, at age 17. He won 30 PGA circuit events, and was a four-time winner of the Canadian Open (1924–25, 1928–29); this is a record for that event. In 1925, Diegel outperformed over 100 competitors to win the Florida Open (billed as the &quot; Greatest Field Of Golfers Ever to Play in Florida &quot; ) at the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club. Diegel was selected for the inaugural 1927 Ryder Cup team, and went on to play on the 1929, 1931, and 1933 teams as well. Diegel&apos;s greatest season was 1928. He won the Canadian Open and, in winning the 1928 PGA Championship, stopped the four-year winning streak of Walter Hagen (defeating him in the quarter-final to avenge defeats by Hagen in the 1925 quarter-final and the 1926 final). Diegel achieved the rare feat of defending both titles successfully in 1929, this time defeating Hagen in the semi-finals of the PGA. Diegel was a runner-up to Bobby Jones at the British Open in 1930. Diegel was an excellent ball-striker, but struggled with his putting after joining the Tour. After extensive experimentation, he eventually developed an unusual putting style where he pointed both elbows outwards; this was referred to as &apos;Diegeling&apos;. He was a Tour winner from 1920 to 1934, but dropped out of regular Tour contention when he reached his mid-30s. Diegel died in North Hollywood, California, aged 52; he had taken a position there as a club professional after scaling back his Tour play. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2003.
