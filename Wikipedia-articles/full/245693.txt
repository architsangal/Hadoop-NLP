[ the graffiti the Styx album Kilroy Was Here (album) ] [ December 2011 ] { WWII Memorial in } { Washington DC. } Kilroy was here is an American popular culture expression, often seen in graffiti. Its origins are debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle —a bald-headed man (possibly with a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with the fingers of each hand clutching the wall—is widely known among U.S. residents who lived during World War II. In Britain, the graffito is known as &quot; Mr Chad &quot; or just &quot; Chad &quot;, and the Australian equivalent to the phrase is &quot; Foo was here &quot;. &quot; Foo was here &quot; might date from World War I, and the character of Chad may have derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating &quot; Kilroy was here &quot;. A Quincy, Massachusetts shipyard inspector named J.J. Kilroy may have been the origin of the phrase &quot; Kilroy was here &quot; in World War II. Etymologist Dave Wilton wrote that &quot; Some time during the war, Chad and Kilroy met, and in the spirit of Allied unity merged, with the British drawing appearing over the American phrase. &quot; &quot; Foo was here &quot; became popular amongst Australian schoolchildren of post-war generations. Other names for the character include Smoe, Clem, Flywheel, Private Snoops, Overby, The Jeep, and Sapo. Author Charles Panati says that in the United States &quot; the mischievous face and the phrase became a national joke... The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said, but where it turned up. &quot; [ What&apos;s the origin of &quot; Kilroy was here &quot; ?

[ Origin and use of the phrase ] { Berlin Wall in the } { Newseum in Washington, D.C., USA } The phrase may have originated through United States servicemen, who would draw the doodle and the text &quot; Kilroy was here &quot; on the walls and other places they were stationed, encamped, or visited. Brewer&apos;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes that it was particularly associated with the Air Transport Command, at least when observed in the United Kingdom. { Brewer&apos;s: Cassell, 1956. p. 523 } At some point, the graffito (Chad) and slogan (Kilroy was here) must have merged. [ http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-kil1.htm Kilroy was here Quinion Michael World Wide Words 13 June 2010 ] An early example of the phrase being used may date from 1937, before World War II. A US History Channel video broadcast in 2007, Fort Knox: Secrets Revealed, includes a shot of a chalked &quot; KILROY WAS HERE &quot; dated 5/13/1937: Fort Knox &apos;s vault was loaded in 1937 and inaccessible until the 1970s, when an audit was carried out and the footage was shot.

This began leading Hitler to believe that Kilroy could be the name or codename of a high-level Allied spy. At the time of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, it was rumored that Stalin found &quot; Kilroy was here &quot; written in the VIP &apos;s bathroom, prompting him to ask his aides who Kilroy was. { Rottman, Gordon L.: FUBAR: Soldier Slang of World War II ISBN # 978-1-84603-175-5) } War photographer Robert Capa noted a use of the phrase at Bastogne in December 1944: &quot; On the black, charred walls of an abandoned barn, scrawled in white chalk, was the legend of McAuliffe &apos;s GIs: KILROY WAS STUCK HERE. &quot; [ Capa Robert Slightly Out of Focus 1947 Henry Holt and Co. ] [ Foo was here ] [ Foo was here ] &quot; Foo was here &quot; graffiti is said to have been widely used by Australians during World War I : &quot; He was chalked on the side of railway carriages, appeared in probably every camp that the 1st AIF World War I served in and generally made his presence felt. &quot; [ http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-help/faq6.htm Frequently Asked Questions, 251 to 300 Diggerhistory.info 2010-06-14 ] [ http://www.polityka.pl/historia/217663%2C1%2Ckilroy-tu-byl.read Kilroy tu był Dziatkiewicz Łukasz 4 November 2009 Polityka Polish 13 June 2010 ] If this is the case, then &quot; Foo was here &quot; pre-dates &quot; Kilroy was here &quot; by about twenty years. The phrase &quot; Foo was here &quot; was used from 1941–45 as the Australian equivalent of &quot; Kilroy was here &quot;. &quot; Foo &quot; was thought of as a gremlin by the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, and the name may have derived from the 1930s cartoon Smokey Stover, in which the character used the word &quot; foo &quot; for anything he could not remember the name of.

One theory identifies James J. Kilroy (1902–1962), [ James J. Kilroy 10932011 ] an American shipyard inspector, as the man behind the signature. The New York Times indicated J.J. Kilroy as the origin in 1946, based on the results of a contest conducted by the Amalgamated Transit Union to establish the origin of the phenomenon. [ 1946 Kilroy Was Here In Transit Amalgamated Transit Union 54-55 14 ] The article noted that Kilroy had marked the ships themselves as they were being built—so, at a later date, the phrase would be found chalked in places that no graffiti-artist could have reached (inside sealed hull spaces, for example), which then fed the mythical significance of the phrase—after all, if Kilroy could leave his mark there, who knew where else he could go? { &quot; Transit Association Ships a Street Car To Shelter Family of &apos;Kilroy Was Here&apos; &quot;, } { The New York Times, December 24, 1946. } Brewer&apos;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes this as a possible origin, but suggests that &quot; the phrase grew by accident. &quot; During World War II he worked at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, where he claimed to have used the phrase to mark rivets he had checked. The builders, whose rivets J.J. Kilroy was counting, were paid depending on the number of rivets they put in. A riveter would make a chalk mark at the end of his or her shift to show where they had left off and the next riveter had started. Unscrupulous riveters discovered that, if they started work before the inspector arrived, they could receive extra pay by erasing the previous worker&apos;s chalk mark and chalking a mark farther back on the same seam, giving themselves credit for some of the previous riveter&apos;s work. J.J. Kilroy stopped this practice by writing &quot; Kilroy was here &quot; at the site of each chalk mark. At the time, ships were being sent out before they had been painted, so when sealed areas were opened for maintenance, soldiers found an unexplained name scrawled. Thousands of servicemen may have potentially seen his slogan on the outgoing ships and Kilroy&apos;s apparent omnipresence and inscrutability sparked a legend. The slogan began to be regarded as proof that a ship had been checked well, and as a kind of protective talisman.

The Lowell Sun reported in November 1945, with the headline &quot; How Kilroy Got There &quot;, that a 21-year old soldier from Everett, Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy, Jr., wrote &quot; Kilroy will be here next week &quot; on a barracks bulletin board at a Boca Raton airbase while ill with flu, and the phrase was picked up by other airmen and quickly spread abroad. The Associated Press similarly reported at the same time that according to Sgt. Kilroy, when he was hospitalized early in World War II a friend of his, Sgt. James Maloney, wrote the phrase on a bulletin board. Maloney continued to write the shortened phrase when he was shipped out a month later, and other airmen soon picked up the phrase. Francis Kilroy himself only wrote the phrase a couple of times.

Chatterton was nicknamed &quot; Chat &quot;, which may then have become &quot; Chad. &quot; Life Magazine in 1946 said that the RAF and Army were competing for claiming him as their own invention, but they agreed that he had first appeared around 1944. The character resembles Alice the Goon, a character in Popeye who first appeared in 1933; another name for Chad was &quot; The Goon &quot;. A theory suggested by a spokesman for the Royal Air Force Museum London in 1977 was that Chad was probably an adaptation of the Greek letter Omega, used as the symbol for electrical resistance; his creator was probably an electrician in a ground crew.

The character is usually drawn in Australia with pluses and minuses as eyes and the nose and eyes resemble a distorted sine wave. [ Zakia Richard D.

One correspondent said that in 1941 at RAF Yatesbury a man named Dickie Lyle drew a version of the diagram as a face when the instructor had left the room, and wrote &quot; Wot, no leave? &quot; beneath it. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/nov/25/books.guardianreview8 Dimpled and pregnant Smallweed 25 November 2000 The Guardian 14 June 2010 ] This idea was repeated in a submission to the BBC in 2005 that included a story of a 1941 radar lecturer in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire drawing the circuit diagram, and the words &quot; WOT! No electrons? &quot; being added. The RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association says that the image came from a diagram of how to approximate a square wave using sine waves, also at RAF Yatesbury and with an instructor named Chadwick, and was initially called Domie or Doomie, [ http://www.rafcaa.org.uk/legends.html Wot no respect? 9 December 2009 RAF Related Legends RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association 14 June 2010 ] the latter name also being noted by Life as used by the RAF. As alternatives to Chatterton or Mr Chadwick as the origin of the name Chad, REME claimed that the name came from their training school, nicknamed &quot; Chad&apos;s Temple &quot;, the RAF claimed it arose from Chadwick House at a Lancashire radio school, and the Desert Rats claimed it came from an officer in El Alamein. It is unclear how Chad gained widespread popularity or became conflated with Kilroy. It was, however, widely in use by the late part of the war and in the immediate post-war years, with slogans ranging from the simple &quot; What, no bread? &quot; or &quot; Wot, no char ? &quot; to the plaintive; one sighting, on the side of a British 1st Airborne Division glider in Operation Market Garden, had the complaint &quot; Wot, no engines? &quot; The Los Angeles Times reported in 1946 that Chad was &quot; the No. 1 doodle &quot;, noting his appearance on a wall in the Houses of Parliament after the 1945 Labour election victory, with &quot; Wot, no Tories? &quot; [ http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/415580011.html?dids%3D415580011%3A415580011%26amp%3BFMT%3DABS%26amp%3BFMTS%3DABS%3AAI%26amp%3Btype%3Dhistoric%26amp%3Bdate%3DDec%2B01%2C%2B1946%26amp%3Bauthor%3D%26amp%3Bpub%3DLos%2BAngeles%2BTimes%26amp%3Bdesc%3DNO.%2B1%2BDOODLE%26amp%3Bpqatl%3Dgoogle No. 1 Doodle Plimer Denis 1 December 1946 Los Angeles Times 13 June 2010 ] Trains in Austria in 1946 featured Mr. Chad along with the phrase &quot; Wot—no Fuehrer ? &quot; [ http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id%3DEK80AAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3DlYYFAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3D6559%2C1420808 &quot; Mr. Chad &quot; travels 12 October 1946 Schenectady Gazette 13 June 2010 ] As rationing became less common, so did the joke; while the cartoon is occasionally sighted today as &quot; Kilroy was here &quot;, [ Martin Gary http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/219500.html Kilroy was here Phrases.org.uk 2010-05-23 ] &quot; Chad &quot; and his complaints have long fallen from popular use, although they continue to be seen occasionally on walls and in references in popular culture.
