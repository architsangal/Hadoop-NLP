Raw oysters, opened, and presented on a plate { shrimp cocktail } Shellfish is a culinary and fisheries term for exoskeleton -bearing aquatic invertebrate s used as food, including various species of mollusc s, crustacean s, and echinoderm s. Although most kinds of shellfish are harvested from saltwater environments, some kinds are found only in freshwater. In addition a few species of land crabs are eaten, for example Cardisoma guanhumi in the Caribbean. Despite the name, shellfish are not a kind of fish, but are simply animals that live in water. Many varieties of shellfish ( crustacean s in particular) are actually closely related to insects and arachnids, making up one of the main classes of the phylum Arthropoda. Cephalopods (squid, octopus, cuttlefish) and bivalves (clams, oysters) are mollusc s, as are snails and slugs. Familiar marine molluscs enjoyed as a food source by humans include many species of clam s, mussel s, oyster s, winkle s, and scallop s. Some crustaceans commonly eaten are shrimp, prawn, lobster, crayfish, and crab s.

In common parlance, as in having &quot; shellfish &quot; for dinner, it can refer to anything from clams and oysters to lobster and shrimp. For regulatory purposes it is often narrowly defined as filter-feeding molluscs such as clams, mussels, and oyster to the exclusion of crustacean s and all else. { Maryland Shellfish Harvesting Areas, Maryland Department of the Environment } Although the term is primarily applied to marine species, edible freshwater invertebrates such as crayfish and river mussels are also sometimes grouped under the umbrella of &quot; shellfish &quot;. Although their shells may differ, all shellfish are invertebrates.

[ In the United States ] Boiled Maine Lobster Lobster in particular is a great delicacy in the United States, where families in the Northeast region make them into the centerpiece of a clam bake, usually for special occasions. Lobsters are eaten on much of the East Coast; the American lobster ranges from Newfoundland down to about the Carolinas, but is most often associated with Maine.
