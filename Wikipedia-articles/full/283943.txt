There were no larger Roman settlements on the territory of Ruma, but a certain number of agricultural estates known as &quot; villae rusticae &quot; were located there. Migrations of Huns, Germanic peoples, Avars and Slavs destroyed the Roman culture in this area. During the following centuries, the region was ruled by Frankish Empire, Bulgarian Empire, Byzantine Empire and Kingdom of Hungary. The settlement named Ruma was first mentioned in an Ottoman defter from 1566/7. In that period Ruma was a village inhabited by Serbs, with 49 houses a church and three priests. Since 1718, Ruma was under administration of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1746, the town of Ruma was founded near the village of Ruma.

In 1933, Ruma officially gained the status of a city. When World War II began, Ruma was one of the centers of German national minority in Vojvodina.
