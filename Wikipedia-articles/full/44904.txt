[ the left-wing Danish party Red-Green Alliance (Denmark) ] [ all ] In politics, a red-green alliance is an alliance of &quot; red &quot; social-democratic or democratic socialist parties with &quot; green &quot; environmentalist parties. The alliance is often based on common left political views, especially a shared distrust of corporate or capitalist institution s. While the &quot; red &quot; parties tend to focus on the adverse effects of capitalism on the working class, the &quot; green &quot; parties tend to focus on the ecological consequences of unrestrained capitalism. The term was coined by Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt in a debate against the opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson 1994.
