He won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics (shared with Michael Spence and Joseph E. Stiglitz ). [ The Market for Lemons and Asymmetric Information ] Akerlof is perhaps best known for his article, &quot; The Market for Lemons : Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism &quot;, published in Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1970, in which he identified certain severe problems that afflict markets characterized by asymmetrical information, the paper for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

[ Identity Economics ] In his latest work, Akerlof and collaborator Rachel Kranton of Duke University introduce social identity into formal economic analysis, creating the field of Identity Economics. Drawing on social psychology and many fields outside of economics, Akerlof and Kranton argue that individuals do not have preferences only over different goods and services. They also adhere to social norms for how different people should behave. The norms are linked to a person&apos;s social identities. These ideas first appeared in their article &quot; Economics and Identity &quot;, published in Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2000. [ Reproductive technology shock ] In the late 1990s Akerlof&apos;s ideas attracted the attention of some on both sides of the debate over legal abortion. In articles appearing in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, [ 10.2307/2946680 Akerlof George A. Yellen Janet Janet Yellen Katz Lawrence F. Lawrence F. Katz yes 1996 An Analysis on Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States Quarterly Journal of Economics 111 2 277–317 The MIT Press 2946680 ] The Economic Journal, [ 10.1111/1468-0297.00288 Akerlof George A. 1998 Men Without Children Economic Journal 108 447 287–309 2565562 Blackwell Publishing ] and other forums Akerlof described a phenomenon that he labeled &quot; reproductive technology shock. &quot; He contended that the new technologies that had helped to spawn the late twentieth century sexual revolution, modern contraceptives and legal abortion, had not only failed to suppress the incidence of out-of-wedlock childbearing but also had actually worked to increase it. According to Akerlof, for women who did not use them, these technologies had largely transformed the old paradigm of socio-sexual assumptions, expectations, and behaviors in ways that were especially disadvantageous. For example, the availability of legal abortion now allowed men to view their offspring as the deliberate product of female choice rather than as the chance product of sexual intercourse. Thus, it encouraged biological fathers to reject not only the notion of an obligation to marry the mother but also the very idea of a paternal obligation. While Akerlof did not recommend legal restrictions on either abortion or the availability of contraceptives, his analysis seemed to lend support to those who did. Thus, a scholar strongly associated with liberal and Democratic-leaning policy positions, has been approvingly cited by conservative and Republican-leaning analysts and commentators.

IE: &quot; Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting, lax regulation, or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations. Bankruptcy for profit occurs most commonly when a government guarantees a firm&apos;s debt obligations. &quot; { 1993 George Akerlof and } { Paul Romer, &quot; Looting: The Economic Underworld of Bankruptcy for Profit &quot;, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 24, Brookings Institution, Washington, DC, 1993, as quoted in } [ Econned Yves Smith Palgrave Macmillan 2010 978-0-230-62051-3 ] { pages 164-165 } Yves Smith argues in her book &quot; Econned &quot; that Akerlof and Romer&apos;s &quot; Looting &quot; theory applies to the subprime mortgage crisis and the Financial crisis of 2007-2010. She argues that the &apos;Looted&apos; companies in this case are banks and others who were &apos;looted&apos; by certain traders and executives within those companies.

In this lecture Akerlof proposed a new agenda for macroeconomics with inclusion of those norms. { &apos;&apos;The Missing Motivation in Macroeconomics&apos;&apos; } He is a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security, and co-director of the Social Interactions, Identity and Well-Being program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). He is in the advisory board of the Institute for New Economic Thinking. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1985.

His mother was Jewish, from a family that had immigrated from Germany. His father was a Swedish immigrant. { George A.
