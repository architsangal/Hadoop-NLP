A neutron bomb or enhanced radiation weapon (ERW) or weapon of reinforced radiation is a type of thermonuclear weapon designed specifically to release a large portion of its energy as energetic neutron radiation ( fast neutrons ) rather than explosive energy. Although their extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated, it is the enormous radiation released by ERWs that is meant to be a major source of casualties. The levels of neutron radiation released are able to penetrate through thick, protective materials such as armor, making them useful as an anti-tank weapon.

The weapon&apos;s X-ray mirrors and radiation case, made of uranium or lead in a standard bomb, are instead made of chromium or nickel so that the neutrons can escape. [ June 2011 ] The bombs also require amounts of tritium on the order of a few tens of grams. [ Kalinowski, Martin International control of tritium for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament CRC Press 2004 978-0-415-31615-6 10 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DYThIeCSxVZ4C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA10 ] The &quot; usual &quot; nuclear weapon yield —expressed as kT TNT equivalent —is not a measure of a neutron weapon&apos;s destructive power. It refers only to the energy released (mostly heat and blast), and does not express the lethal effect of neutron radiation on living organisms. Compared to a fission bomb with the identical explosive yield, a neutron bomb would emit about ten times [ Kistiakovsky George The folly of the neutron bomb Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Sep 1978 34 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DaAoAAAAAMBAJ%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA27%26amp%3Bdq%3D8000%20rads%20of%20fast%20neutron%20radiation%20%28from%20a%20neutron%20bomb%29%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA27#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 11 February 2011 27 ] the amount of neutron radiation. In a fission bomb, the radiation pulse energy is approximately 5% of the entire energy released; in the neutron bomb it would be closer to 50%. [ June 2011 ] A neutron bomb releases a much higher amount of neutrons than a fission bomb of the same explosive yield. Furthermore, these neutrons are of much higher energy (14 MeV) than those released during a fission reaction (1-2 MeV). [ Hafemeister, David W.

Cohen of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who developed the concept in 1958. [ Robert D. McFadden Samuel T.

D } Development was subsequently postponed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 following protests against his administration&apos;s plans to deploy neutron warheads in Europe. President Ronald Reagan restarted production in 1981. [ On this Day: 7 April http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/7/newsid_2523000/2523051.stm Jimmy Carter&apos;s successor, Ronald Reagan, changed US policy and gave the order for the production of neutron warheads to start in 1981.... BBC 1978-04-07 2010-07-02 ] Three types of ERW were built by the United States. { Nuclear Weapon News and Background } The W66 warhead, for the anti-ICBM Sprint missile system, was deployed in 1975 and retired the next year, along with the missile system. The W70 Mod 3 warhead was developed for the short-range, tactical Lance missile, and the W79 Mod 0 was developed for artillery shells. The latter two types were retired by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, following the end of the Cold War. [ Christopher Ruddy Bomb inventor says U.S. defenses suffer because of politics http://www.manuelsweb.com/sam_cohen.htm With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism as we knew it, the Bush administration moved to dismantle all of our tactical nuclear weapons, including the Reagan stockpile of neutron bombs. In Cohen&apos;s mind, America was brought back to Square One. Without tactical weapons like the neutron bomb, America would be left with two choices if an enemy was winning a conventional war: surrender, or unleash the holocaust of strategic nuclear weapons. Tribune-Review June 15, 1997 2010-07-03 ] { Types of Nuclear Weapons } The last W70 Mod 3 warhead was dismantled in 1996, { March 13, 1996 } and the last W79 Mod 0 was dismantled by 2003, when the dismantling of all W79 variants was completed. { National Nuclear Security Administration - Homepage } Besides the United States and Soviet Union, France and China are understood to have tested neutron or enhanced radiation bombs in the past, with France apparently leading the field with an early test of the technology in 1967 { BBC News: Neutron bomb: Why &apos;clean&apos; is deadly } and an &quot; actual &quot; neutron bomb in 1980. { UK parliamentary question on whether condemnation was considered by Thatcher government } The 1999 Cox Report indicates that China is able to produce neutron bombs, { U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People&apos;s Republic of China } although no country is currently known to deploy them. Considerable controversy arose in the U.S. and Western Europe, following a June 1977 Washington Post exposé describing U.S. government plans to purchase the bomb. The article focused on the fact that it was the first weapon specifically intended to kill humans with radiation. [ Wittner, Lawrence S.

[ February 2011 ] This is because neutrons are absorbed by air [ December 2011 ], so a high-yield neutron bomb is not able to radiate neutrons beyond its blast range and so would have no destructive advantage over a normal hydrogen bomb. This intense pulse of high-energy neutrons is intended as the principal killing mechanism, not the fallout, heat or blast. Although neutron bombs are commonly believed to &quot; leave the infrastructure intact &quot;, current designs have explosive yields in the kiloton range, { List of All U.S. Nuclear Weapons } the detonation of which would cause considerable destruction through blast and heat effects. Neutron bombs could be used as strategic anti-ballistic missile weapons or as tactical weapons intended for use against armored forces. [ June 2011 ] The neutron bomb was originally conceived by the U.S. military as a weapon that could stop massed Soviet armored divisions from overrunning allied nations without destroying the infrastructure of the allied nation. [ Muller, Richard A. Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines W.W. Norton &amp; Company 2009 978-0-393-33711-2 148 http://books.google.com/books?id%3D6DBnS2g-KrQC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA148 ] [ Effects of a neutron bomb detonation ] Upon detonation, a 1 kiloton neutron bomb would produce a large blast wave, and a powerful pulse of both thermal radiation and ionizing radiation, mostly in the form of fast (14.1MeV) neutrons. The thermal pulse would cause 3rd degree burns to unprotected skin out to approximately 500m. The blast would create at least 4.6 PSI out to a radius of 600m, which would severely damage non-reinforced structures { Calculated from http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq5.html asuming 0.5 kt combined blast and thermal }. At this distance the blast would cause very few direct casualties as the human body is resistant to sheer overpressure, however, the powerful winds produced by this overpressure are capable of throwing human bodies into objects or throwing objects at high velocity, both with lethal results, rendering casualties highly dependent on surroundings { http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-125/125-ExplosionsandRefugeChambers.pdf }. The pulse of neutron radiation would cause immediate and permanent incapacitation to unprotected humans out to 900m, with death occuring in one or two days. The lethal dose would extend out past 1400m, where approximately half of those exposed would die of radiation sickness after several weeks. While this would seem to support the notion of neutron bombs being capable of killing the population while leaving buildings standing, at least in the ring between 600m and 1400m, several factors argue against this interpretation. The thermal pulse would create a large fire that could easily spread outside the blast zone, and the relatively small area covered by the bomb would mean that any sizable target would need several dispersed hits to blanket it, with inevitable overlap. There would also be significant fallout, both from neutron activation of target materials and from the fission primary in the bomb itself. [ May 2012 ] [ Use against armor ] One of the uses for which this weapon was conceived is large-scale anti-tank weaponry. Armored fighting vehicle s offer a relatively high degree of protection against heat and blast, the primary destructive mechanisms of normal nuclear weapons. That is, military personnel inside a tank can be expected to survive an &quot; ordinary &quot; nuclear explosion at relatively close range, while the vehicle&apos;s nuclear/biological/chemical protection systems ensure a high degree of operability even in a nuclear fallout environment. [ June 2011 ] ER weapons are meant to kill a much higher percentage of enemy personnel inside such protected environments through the release of a higher percentage of their yield in the form of neutron ionizing radiation, against which tank armors, excluding depleted uranium, are ineffective. [ October 2011 ] [ Questionable effectiveness in modern anti-tank role ] The questionable effectiveness of ER weapons against modern tank s is cited as one of the main reasons why these weapons are no longer fielded or stockpiled. With the increase in average tank armor thickness since the first ER weapons were fielded, tank armor protection approaches the level where tank crews are now almost completely protected from radiation effects. Therefore for an ER weapon to incapacitate a modern tank crew through irradiation, { http://collinsj.tripod.com/protect.htm average tank armor thickness increase } the weapon must now be detonated at such a close proximity to the tank that the nuclear explosion &apos;s blast would now be equally effective at incapacitating it and its crew. { http://books.google.com/books?id=mYVNkaEJpz4C &amp; pg=PA47 &amp; dq=%22main+battle+tank%22 &amp; hl=en &amp; ei=aUEyTrr0Gun_sQL0i8HmCg &amp; sa=X &amp; oi=book_result &amp; ct=result &amp; resnum=4 &amp; ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage &amp; q=%22main%20battle%20tank%22 &amp; f=false New Scientist March 13 1986 pg 45 } [ Use against ballistic missiles ] As an anti-ballistic missile weapon, an ER warhead was developed for the Sprint missile system as part of the Safeguard Program to protect United States cities and missile silo s from incoming Soviet warheads by damaging their electronic components with the intense neutron flux.
