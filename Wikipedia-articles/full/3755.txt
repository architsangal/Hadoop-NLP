[ 2013-04-03T19:05:04Z yes ] [ the chemical element ] [ borium, a tungsten carbide product ] [ ] Boron ( [ icon ˈ b ɔər ɒ n ] ) is the chemical element with atomic number 5 and the chemical symbol  B. Because boron is produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, [ http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id%3D17594 Q &amp; A: Where does the element Boron come from? 2011-12-04 ] it is a low-abundance element in both the solar system and the Earth&apos;s crust. However, boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate mineral s. These are mined industrially as evaporate ore s, such as borax and kernite. Chemically uncombined boron, which is classed as a metalloid, is not found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty, as boron tends to form refractory materials containing small amounts of carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder and crystalline boron is black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on Mohs&apos; scale ), and a poor conductor at room temperature. Elemental boron is used as a dopant in the semiconductor industry. The major industrial-scale uses of boron compounds are in sodium perborate bleaches, and the borax component of fiberglass insulation. Boron polymers and ceramics play specialized roles as high-strength lightweight structural and refractory materials. Boron compounds are used in silica-based glasses and ceramics to give them resistance to thermal shock. Boron-containing reagents are used for as intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used, or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which ( boron-10 ) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent. In biology, borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropod s and are used as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and a natural boron-containing organic antibiotic is known. Boron is essential to life. Small amounts of boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron necessary in soils. Experiments indicate a role for boron as an ultratrace element in animals, but the nature of its role in animal physiology is unknown. [ History and etymology ] The name boron originates from the Arabic word بورق buraq or the Persian word بوره burah; [ The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots Joseph T. Shipley JHU Press 2001 978-0-8018-6784-2 http://books.google.com/?id%3Dm1UKpE4YEkEC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA83 ] which are names for the mineral borax. [ http://www.innvista.com/science/chemistry/elements/etymolo.htm Etymology of Elements innvista 2009-06-06 ] Sassolite Boron compounds were known thousands of years ago. Borax was known from the deserts of western Tibet, where it received the name of tincal, derived from the Sanskrit. Borax glazes were used in China from AD300, and some tincal even reached the West, where the Persian alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān seems to mention it in 700. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in the hot springs ( soffioni ) near Florence, Italy, and became known as sal sedativum, with mainly medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was the main source of European borax from 1827 to 1872, at which date American sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used chemicals until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith &apos;s Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized these compounds and made them in volume and hence cheap. { Hildebrand, G. H. (1982) &quot; Borax Pioneer: Francis Marion Smith. &quot; San Diego: Howell-North Books. p. 267 ISBN 0-8310-7148-6 } Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy [ Davy H 1809 An account of some new analytical researches on the nature of certain bodies, particularly the alkalies, phosphorus, sulphur, carbonaceous matter, and the acids hitherto undecomposed: with some general observations on chemical theory http://books.google.com/books?id%3DgpwEAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA140#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 99 33–104 ] and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. { Gay Lussac, J.L. and Thenard, L.J. (1808) &quot; Sur la décomposition et la recomposition de l&apos;acide boracique, &quot; Annales de chimie [later: Annales de chemie et de physique], vol. 68, pp. 169–174. } In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of the electrodes. In his subsequent experiments he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. They showed by oxidizing boron with air that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron.

Most studies on &quot; boron &quot; involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. Chemically, boron behaves more similarly to silicon than to aluminium. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide, hot concentrated nitric acid, hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and chromic acid s. [ Boron. I.

Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form boron trioxide : [ Walter de Gruyter 1985 91–100 814–864 3-11-007511-3 Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie Arnold F.

Boron atoms are pink, with bridging oxygens in red, and four hydroxyl hydrogens in white. Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp 2 with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp 3, each carrying a formal charge of −1. The oxidation state of all borons is III. This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals. Boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides, for example, 2 B + 3 Br 2 → 2 BBr 3 The trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide. [ Chemical compounds ] { Boron (III) trifluoride structure, showing &quot; empty &quot; boron p orbital in pi-type } { coordinate covalent bond s } In its most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides. The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are Lewis acid s in that they readily form adduct s with electron-pair donors, which are called Lewis base s. For example, fluoride (F - ) and boron trifluoride (BF 3 ) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF 4 -. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form boric acid. Boron is found in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. The more than one hundred borate s all feature boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never feature boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate centers is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na + ) in borax. [ Boron nitride ] The boron nitride s are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They adopt structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon ), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acid ic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively-charged boron and negatively-charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.

Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, tetraphenylborate (B(C 6 H 5 ) 4 - ) vs triphenylborane (B(C 6 H 5 ) 3 ). Many are produced from hydroboration, which employs diborane (B 2 H 6 ). [ Compounds of B(I) and B(II) ] Although these are not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N 2, is not isolable in condensed form, but B 2 F 4 and B 4 Cl 4 are well characterized. Ball-and-stick model of superconductor magnesium diboride. Boron atoms lie in hexagonal aromatic graphite-like layers, with a charge of −1 per boron. Magnesium (II) ions lie between layers Binary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, feature boron in oxidation state less than III. Illustrative is magnesium diboride (MgB 2 ). Each boron has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of 2+.In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar, with an extra double bond for each boron, with the boron atoms forming sheets akin to the carbon in graphite. However, unlike the case with hexagonal boron nitride which by comparison lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in the plane of magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In addition, in 2001 this material was found to be a high-temperature superconductor. [ The Preparation and Structure of Magnesium Boride, MgB 2 Morton E. Jones and Richard E.

Included in this series are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (B 12 H 12 2- ), decaborane (B 10 H 14 ), and the carborane s such as C 2 B 10 H 12. Characteristically such compounds feature boron with coordination numbers greater than four. [ Isotopes ] [ Isotopes of boron ] Boron has two naturally occurring and stable isotope s, 11 B (80.1%) and 10 B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of δ 11 B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11 B and 10 B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7 B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10 −22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B( O H ) 3 and [B(OH) 4 ] −. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H 2 O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the 10 B(OH) 4 ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11 B(OH) 3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11 B enrichment in seawater relative to both ocean ic crust and continent al crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.

It can serve either function in the form of borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactor s, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive. [ Duderstadt James J. Hamilton, Louis J. Nuclear Reactor Analysis Wiley-Interscience 1976 0-471-22363-8 245 ] In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10 B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6 Li and 10 B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection. [ J.

Petravic M. 16 ] [ Depleted boron (boron-11) ] Cosmic radiation will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in 10 B, if it is present in the spacecraft&apos;s semiconductors, producing a gamma ray, an alpha particle, and a lithium ion. These resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor &apos;chip&apos; structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or single event upset ). In radiation hardened semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use depleted boron which is greatly enriched in 11 B and contains almost no 10 B. 11 B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a by-product of the nuclear industry. 11 B is also a candidate as a fuel for aneutronic fusion. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500  k eV, it produces three alpha particles and 8.7  MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long term radioactivity thereby endangering operating personnel. Whereas, the alpha particles from 11 B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off. [ W. M.

The earliest routes to elemental boron involved reduction of boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However the product is almost always contaminated with metal boride s. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron, for the use in semiconductor industry, is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the zone melting or Czochralski process es.

Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade. The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content. Consumers have moved towards the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content. The average cost of crystalline boron is $5/g. [ http://www.rareearth.org/boron_properties.htm Los Alamos National Laboratory Boron Properties 2008-09-18 ] Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Eti Mine Company of Turkey opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate ( borax ) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.

A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Asia with a consequent increase in demand for borates has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.

Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B 2 O 3 ), liquid (BBr 3 ), or gaseous boron sources (B 2 H 6 or BF 3 ). However, after 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF 3 as a boron source. [ 51–54 Fundamentals of semiconductor manufacturing and process control May Gary S.

This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B 12 C 3 (i.e., with B 12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon as the suggested C 3 units are replaced with B-C chains, and there are smaller (B 6 ) octahedra present as well. (See the article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vest s, and numerous other structural applications. Boron carbide&apos;s ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived radionuclide s (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area. [ Alan W.

Fish have survived for 30  min in a saturated boric acid solution and can survive longer in strong borax solutions.

The borane s (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but toxicity depends on structure. [ 102;385–386 Borates: handbook of deposits, processing, properties, and use Garrett, Donald E. Academic Press 1998 0-12-276060-3 ] [ 2009-05-05 http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/boron.htm Boron ] The boranes are toxic as well as highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard due to its reducing nature, and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.
