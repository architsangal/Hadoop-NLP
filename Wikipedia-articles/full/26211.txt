The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows for the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them, closing a perceived loophole that allowed someone who told a man to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually do it. RICO was enacted by section 901(a) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 ( [ 91 452 84 922 1970 10 15 ] ). RICO is codified as Chapter 96 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 18 U.S.C. § 1961–1968. While its original use was to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime, its application has been more widespread. It has been speculated that the name and acronym were selected in a sly reference to the movie Little Caesar, which featured a notorious gangster named Rico. The original drafter of the bill, G. Robert Blakey, refused to confirm or deny this. [ http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/rico.asp RICO Suave Snopes.com 2004-12-21 2006-03-26 ] G. Robert Blakey remains an expert on RICO; [ http://law.nd.edu/people/faculty-and-administration/teaching-and-research-faculty/g-robert-blakey G. Robert Blakey, William and Dorothy O’Neill Professor of Law 2009-09-30 ] his former student Michael Goldsmith also gained a reputation as one of the nation&apos;s leading RICO experts. [ Michael Goldsmith, Woodruff J. DeemProfessor of Law http://www.law.byu.edu/Law_School/Faculty_Profile?122 2009-09-30 ] [ Summary ] Under RICO, a person who is a member of an enterprise that has committed any two of 35 crimes —27 federal crime s and 8 state crime s —within a 10-year period can be charged with racketeering. Those found guilty of racketeering can be fined up to $25,000 and sentenced to 20 years in prison per racketeering count. In addition, the racketeer must forfeit all ill-gotten gains and interest in any business gained through a pattern of &quot; racketeering activity. &quot; RICO also permits a private individual harmed by the actions of such an enterprise to file a civil suit; if successful, the individual can collect treble damages. When the U.S. Attorney decides to indict someone under RICO, he or she has the option of seeking a pre-trial restraining order or injunction to temporarily seize a defendant&apos;s assets and prevent the transfer of potentially forfeitable property, as well as require the defendant to put up a performance bond. This provision was placed in the law because the owners of Mafia -related shell corporation s often absconded with the assets. An injunction and/or performance bond ensures that there is something to seize in the event of a guilty verdict. In many cases, the threat of a RICO indictment can force defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges, in part because the seizure of assets would make it difficult to pay a defense attorney. Despite its harsh provisions, a RICO-related charge is considered easy to prove in court, as it focuses on patterns of behavior as opposed to criminal acts. [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C958402-1%2C00.html Law: Showdown At Gucci Sanders Alain Painton Priscilla TIME 1989-08-21 2009-09-30 ] There is also a provision for private parties to sue. A &quot; person damaged in his business or property &quot; can sue one or more &quot; racketeers &quot;. The plaintiff must prove the existence of an &quot; enterprise &quot;. The defendant(s) are not the enterprise; in other words, the defendant(s) and the enterprise are not one and the same. There must be one of four specified relationships between the defendant(s) and the enterprise: either the defendant(s) invested the proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise; or the defendant(s) acquired or maintained an interest in, or control over, the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity; or the defendant(s) conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise &quot; through &quot; the pattern of racketeering activity; or the defendant(s) conspired to do one of the above. In essence, the enterprise is the victim of the racketeers. A civil RICO action, like many lawsuits based on federal law, can be filed in state or federal court. [ http://www.dealer-magazine.com/index.asp?article%3D481 Dealer Magazine Can You Be Subject to a RICO Claim? Van Over Gil 2009-09-30 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] Both the federal and civil components allow for the recovery of treble damages (damages in triple the amount of actual/compensatory damages). Although its primary intent was to deal with organized crime, Blakey said that Congress never intended it to merely apply to the Mob. He once told Time, &quot; We don&apos;t want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels, and another set for those whose collars are white and have Ivy League diplomas. &quot; [ RICO offenses ] Under the law, the meaning of racketeering activity is set out at [ 18 1961 ]. As currently amended it includes: Any violation of state statutes against gambling, murder, kidnapping, extortion, arson, robbery, bribery, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in the Controlled Substances Act ); Any act of bribery, counterfeiting, theft, embezzlement, fraud, dealing in obscene matter, obstruction of justice, slavery, racketeering, gambling, money laundering, commission of murder-for-hire, and several other offenses covered under the Federal criminal code ( Title 18 ); Embezzlement of union funds; Bankruptcy fraud or securities fraud; Drug trafficking; long-term and elaborate drug networks can also be prosecuted using the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute; Criminal copyright infringement; Money laundering and related offenses; Bringing in, aiding or assisting aliens in illegally entering the country (if the action was for financial gain); Acts of terrorism. Pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. The U.S. Supreme Court has instructed federal courts to follow the continuity-plus-relationship test in order to determine whether the facts of a specific case give rise to an established pattern. Predicate acts are related if they &quot; have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events. &quot; ( H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. ) Continuity is both a closed and open ended concept, referring to either a closed period of conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition. [ Where RICO laws might be applied ] [ April 2009 ] [ August 2009 ] Although some of the RICO predicate acts are extortion and blackmail, one of the most successful applications of the RICO laws has been the ability to indict or sanction individuals for their behavior and actions committed against witnesses and victims in alleged retaliation or retribution for cooperating with federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies. Violations of the RICO laws can be alleged in civil lawsuit cases or for criminal charges. In these instances charges can be brought against individuals or corporations in retaliation for said individuals or corporations working with law enforcement. Further, charges can also be brought against individuals or corporations who have sued or filed criminal charges against a defendant. Anti-SLAPP ( strategic lawsuit against public participation ) laws can be applied in an attempt to curb alleged abuses of the legal system by individuals or corporations who utilize the courts as a weapon to retaliate against whistle blowers, victims, or to silence another&apos;s speech. RICO could be alleged if it can be shown that lawyers and/or their clients conspired and collaborated to concoct fictitious legal complaints solely in retribution and retaliation for themselves having been brought before the courts. Although the RICO laws may cover drug trafficking crimes in addition to other more traditional RICO predicate acts such as extortion, blackmail, and racketeering, large-scale and organized drug networks are now commonly prosecuted under the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute, also known as the &quot; Kingpin Statute &quot;. The CCE laws target only traffickers who are responsible for long-term and elaborate conspiracies; whereas the RICO law can be charged for a variety of organized criminal behavior.

In United States v. Barger, the prosecution team attempted to demonstrate a pattern of behavior to convict Barger and other members of the club of RICO offenses related to guns and illegal drugs. The jury acquitted Barger on the RICO charges with a hung jury on the predicate acts: &quot; There was no proof it was part of club policy, and as much as they tried, the government could not come up with any incriminating minutes from any of our meetings mentioning drugs and guns. &quot; { Hell&apos;s Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and The Hell&apos;s Angels Motorcycle Club, Ralph &apos;Sonny&apos; Barger, with Keith and Kent Zimmerman, 2000 } [ http://www.organized-crime.de/revbar01sonnybarger.htm Organized Crime Research Klaus von Lampe 2000 2007-12-08 ] [ Frank Tieri ] On November 21, 1980, Genovese crime family boss Frank &quot; Funzi &quot; Tieri was the first Mafia boss to be convicted under the RICO Act. [ July 2008 ] [ Catholic sex abuse cases ] In some jurisdictions, RICO suits have been filed against Catholic diocese s, using racketeering laws to prosecute the highers-up in the episcopacy for abuses committed by those under their authority. A Cleveland grand jury cleared two bishops of racketeering charges, finding that their mishandling of sex abuse claims did not amount to criminal racketeering. Certain lawyers and abuse advocates [ December 2009 ] have openly wondered why a similar suit was not filed against archbishop Bernard Law, who escaped prosecution by going into exile in Vatican City.

Milken was accused of using a wide-ranging network of contacts to manipulate stock and bond prices. It was one of the first occasions that a RICO indictment was brought against an individual with no ties to organized crime. Milken pled guilty to six lesser offenses rather than face spending the rest of his life in prison. On September 7, 1988, Milken&apos;s employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert, was alleged to have perticipated in committing an element of RICO, they were later indicted under the legal doctrine that corporations are responsible for their employees&apos; crimes. Drexel avoided RICO charges by pleading no contest to lesser felonies. While many sources say that Drexel pleaded guilty, in truth the firm only admitted it was &quot; not in a position to dispute the allegations. &quot; If Drexel had been indicted, it would have had to post a performance bond of up to $1 billion to avoid having its assets frozen. This would have taken precedence over all of the firm&apos;s other obligations—including the loans that provided 96 percent of its capital. If the bond ever had to be paid, its shareholders would have been practically wiped out. Since banks will not extend credit to a firm indicted under RICO, an indictment would have likely put Drexel out of business. [ Stone Dan G.

[ Pro-life activists ] RICO laws were successfully cited in NOW v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 114 S. Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed. 2d 99 (1994), a suit in which certain parties, including the National Organization for Women, sought damages and an injunction against pro-life activists who physically block access to abortion clinics. The Court held that a RICO enterprise does not need an economic motive, and that the Pro-Life Action Network could therefore qualify as a RICO enterprise. The Court remanded for consideration of whether PLAN committed the requisite acts in a pattern of racketeering activity. [ Mohawk Industries ] On April 26, 2006, the Supreme Court heard Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Williams, [ 547 516 2006 ], which concerned what sort of corporations fell under the scope of RICO.

In spite of Interpol having a standardized definition of RICO-like crimes, the interpretation and national implementation in legislation (and enforcement) widely varies. Most nations do cooperate with the US on RICO enforcement only where their own related laws are specifically broken, but this is in line with the Interpol protocols for such matters. By nation, alphabetically In Australia the Australian Crime Commission has powers based on similar legislation and regulations. New Zealand has a similar arrangement and commission. In Canada the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions enforce rules and regulations that cumulatively are equivalent to RICO. Without other nations enforcing similar legislation to RICO many cross border RICO cases would not be possible. In the overall body of RICO cases that went to trial, at least 50% have had some non-US enforcement component to them. The offshoring of money away from the US finance system as part racketeering (and especially money laundering) is typically a major contributing factor to this. However, other countries have laws that enable the government to seize property with unlawful origins. Mexico and Colombia both have specific laws that define the participation in criminal organizations as a separate crime (see Ley Federal contra la Delincuencia Organizada), { http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/101.pdf } and separate laws that allow the seizure of goods related with these crimes. (see Ley de Extinción de Dominio). { http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LFED.pdf } This latter provides a specific chapter titled &quot; International Cooperation &quot;, which instructs Mexican authorities to cooperate with foreign authorities with respect to organized crime assets within Mexico, and provides the framework by which Mexican authorities may politely request the cooperation of foreign authorities with respect to assets located outside of Mexico, in terms of any international instruments they may be party to. Arguably, this may be construed as allowing the application of the RICO Act in Mexico, provided the relevant international agreements exist among Mexico and countries with RICO or RICO-equivalent provisions.
