[ December 2008 December 2008 ] The Flanaess is the eastern part of the continent of Oerik, one of the four continents of the fictional world of Oerth in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy roleplaying game. The Flanaess has been the setting of dozens of adventures published between the 1970s and 2000s and continues to be the central focus of the campaign world. As well as being home to a number of demihuman and humanoid races, it is also inhabited by the Suel, Bakluni, Oerid, and Flan subraces of humanity. [ Development of the Flanaess ] In late 1972, Dave Arneson demonstrated a new type of game to a group of gamers in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, including game designer Gary Gygax. Gygax agreed to develop a set of rules with Arneson and get the game published; the game eventually became known as &quot; Dungeons &amp; Dragons &quot;. Gygax designed a set of dungeons underneath the ruins of Castle Greyhawk as a testing ground for new rules, character classes and spells. In those early days, there was no &quot; Flanaess &quot;; the world map of &quot; Oerth &quot; was developed by Gygax as circumstances dictated, the new cities and lands simply drawn over a map of North America. Gygax and his friend Rob Kuntz further developed this campaign setting, and by 1976, the lands within a radius of 50 miles had been mapped in depth, and the lands within a radius of approximately 500 miles were in outline form. [ Gygax Gary Gary Gygax Letter from Gary Gygax Alarums and Excursions 15 5–7 Lee Gold October 1976 ] In addition, more distant lands had been roughly sketched out to accommodate various adventures. (For more information about the first days of Gygax&apos;s home campaign, see Greyhawk.) Following yet more work, in 1978 Gygax agreed to publish his world and decided to redevelop Oerth from scratch. Once he had sketched out the entire planet to his satisfaction, { Q: &quot; In Dragon 315, Jim Ward talks about the origins of the Greyhawk setting, and is quoted as having said: &apos;He [Gygax] had the whole world mapped out&apos;. Does this mean you have material about the rest of Oerth hidden in your basement? &quot; Gygax: &quot; Yes, I had a sketch map of the remainder of the globe... &quot; } [ Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part IX, Page 33) EN World 2005-06-21 http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-33.html 2009-03-15 ] { Gygax: &quot; The exact form of the remainder of the globe was not settled upon. I wanted an Atlantis-like continent, and possibly a Lemurian-type one. Likely two large continents would have been added. The nearest would house cultures akin to the Indian, Burmese, Indonesian, Chinese, Tibetan, and Japanese. Another would likely have been the location of African-type cultures, including the Egyptian. A Lemurian culture would have been based on the Central and South American cultures of the Aztec-Mayay-Inca sort. &quot; } [ Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part II, Page 19) EN World 2003-04-06 http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/38912-q-gary-gygax-continuation-thread-part-ii-19.html 2009-03-15 ] one hemisphere of Oerth was dominated by a massive continent called Oerik. Gygax decided to concentrate his first efforts on the continent of Oerik and asked TSR&apos;s printing house about the maximum size of paper they could handle; the answer was 34 &quot; x 22 &quot; (86  cm x 56  cm). He found that, using the scale he desired, he could fit only the northeast corner of Oerik on two of the sheets. { Gygax: &quot; When I was asked to create a campaign setting for TSR to market, I did a new and compact &quot; world &quot; --that only in part, of course, as that was all I could fit onto the two maps allowed. So that became the World of Greyhawk. &quot; } [ Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part I, Page 8) EN World 2002-09-06 http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/22566-q-gary-gygax-part-i-8.html 2009-03-15 ] { Gygax: &quot; I found out the maximum map size TSR could produce, got the go-ahead for two maps of that size, then sat down for a couple of weeks and hand-drew the whole thing. After the maps were done and the features shown were named, I wrote up brief information of the features and states. Much of the information was drawn from my own personal world, but altered to fit the new one depicted on the maps. &quot; } [ Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part IV, Page 11) EN World 2003-11-05 http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-11.html 2009-03-15 ] This corner of Oerik became known as &quot; the Flanaess &quot;, so named in Gygax&apos;s mind because of the peaceful people known as the Flannae who had once lived there. Gygax also added many more new regions, countries and cities, bringing the number of political states to 60: [ Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part X, Page 7) EN World 2006-05-29 http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/161566-gary-gygax-q-part-x-7.html 2009-03-15 ] Almor Furyondy Iuz Pomarj Spindrift Isles Gygax knew that Len Lakofka &apos;s first TSR adventure, The Secret of Bone Hill, was being readied for publication. It was set in Lakofka&apos;s home campaign setting of Lendore Island, so Gygax added that placename to the Spindrift Islands archipelago, and slyly added a reference to Lakofka in the description of the islands: &quot; Lendore Isle is named for the Arch Mage who founded it, but tales of him and the fellowship he brought to the Spindrifts are all but lost. &quot; Ull Ahlissa Geoff Keoland Ratik Sterich Urnst (County) Bandit Kingdoms Gran March Ket Ket was accidentally left out of the Table of Contents in the folio edition. Rel Astra Stonefist Urnst (Duchy) Bissel Great Kingdom Lordship of the Isles Rovers of the Barrens Sunndi Valley of the Mage Valley of the Mage was accidentally left out of the Table of Contents in the folio edition. Blackmoor Gygax borrowed the name of Dave Arneson&apos;s campaign world, Blackmoor, for one of his regions. However, his intention was not to move any part of Arneson&apos;s campaign to his own, and the Greyhawk region of Blackmoor bore no resemblance to Arneson&apos;s world, other than a sly reference to a ruined castle and &quot; extensive ruins are supposed to exist under these ruins. &quot;. &apos;&apos;Gygax: &quot; The Blackmoor on the Oerik maps is certainly not the same as Dave Arneson&apos;s campaign setting. I liked its ring, so I put it onto the map as I was making up names for the various states.

For instance, Perrenland was named after Jeff Perren, who co-wrote the rules for Chainmail with Gygax; Urnst was a homophone of Ernst (his son Ernie); and Sunndi was a near-homophone of Cindy, another of Gygax&apos;s children. [ Revised Greyhawk Index TSR http://www.greyhawkonline.com/canonfire/gh_index.rtf 2009-03-29 ] From Gygax&apos;s prototype map, Darlene Pekul, a freelance artist in Lake Geneva, [ Interview: Darlene Grognardia http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2009/06/interview-darlene.html 2009-06-23 ] developed a full colour map on a hex grid. Gygax was so pleased with the end result that he quickly switched his home Greyhawk campaign over to the new world he had created. { Gygax: &quot; Of course as my campaign world was active, had many players, I did not wish to detail it [for the general public], so I created Oerth, the continent of Oerik, and all that went with it for general use by other DMs. I found I liked it so well that I switched my group&apos;s play to the World of Greyhawk soon after I had finished the maps and manuscript &quot; } [ Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part X, Page 11) EN World 2006-06-04 http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/161566-gary-gygax-q-part-x-11.html 2009-03-15 ] This map formed the basis of the World of Greyhawk when it was published as the 32-page &apos;&apos;The World of Greyhawk&apos;&apos; folio in 1980. Gygax also developed a thousand-year history for the Flanaess that involved a series of cultural and military invasions: the peaceful Flannae had been pushed out by the warlike Suloise; the Suloise in turn had been pushed out by the noble Oeridians, who set up a Great Kingdom of peace and prosperity. However, by 576 CY (the year Gygax chose for his setting), the Oeridian empire had grown decadent and evil, and many subservient regions were rising up in rebellion. The From the Ashes boxed set, published in 1992, advanced this storyline by a decade, involving a continental war and its aftermath. The Adventure Begins boxed set, published in 1998, further advanced the storyline to 591 CY. [ Geography ] The Flanaess can be broken down geographically as follows: the Baklunish Basin in the northwest, the Empire of Iuz in the north, the Thillonrian Peninsula in the northeast, the Sea of Dust in the far west, the Sheldomar Valley in the west, old Ferrond and its southern frontier (including the City of Greyhawk) at the center of the Flanaess, old Sulm and the Aerdy frontier to the east, the old Great Kingdom to the far east, and the Amedio Jungle to the southwest. [ Aerdy ] Aerdy properly refers to the now-defunct Kingdom of Aerdy. Sometimes &quot; Aerdy &quot; is used in reference to the Oeridian tribe which founded the kingdom, though the proper term for the tribe is &quot; Aerdi &quot; ( [ ˈ ɛər d i ] [ AIR dee ] ) { Mentzer, Frank. &quot; Ay pronunseeAY shun gyd &quot; } { Dragon #93 (TSR, 1985) } (which is also the adjectival form). &quot; Aerdy &quot; can also be used in reference to the Great Kingdom of Aerdy, the imperial successor state of the Kingdom of Aerdy. [ Ahlissa ] The ancient Flan kingdom of Ahlissa was founded over 1,700 years ago by the legendary Queen Ehlissa the Enchanter. Modern Ahlissa is generally located in the southeastern portion of the Flanaess, and is one of the largest countries on the subcontinent. Ahlissa is a feudal empire with hereditary rulership, and is currently ruled by His Transcendent Imperial Majesty, Overking Xavener I, Grand Prince of Kalstrand, Crowned Head of House Darmen. [ Amedio Jungle ] The Amedio Jungle is a large stretch of tropical rainforest located in the southwestern Flanaess, on the continent of Oerik. Lying east of the Hellfurnaces, the Amedio extends over 300 leagues south from its northernmost point at Jeklea Bay. The border of the Amedio Jungle and the Hellfurnaces was the setting of Dungeon&apos;s Shackled City Adventure Path. This adventure detailed the history of the region between Jeklea Bay, the Amedio, and the Hellfurnaces, going back 3000 years to the time of the spellweavers &apos; domination of the area. In that time, a battle between the Abyssal hordes and the forces of good took place around what is now the city of Cauldron. [ Baklunish Basin ] The Baklunish Basin is the northwestern portion of the Flanaess. Consisting chiefly of remnants of the ancient Baklunish Empire, the human peoples of these lands are known as the Baklunish. The most important parts of this region include the nations of Ekbir, Ket, Tusmit, Ull, and Zeif, as well as the Dry Steppes and the Plains of the Paynims. Though not technically part of the Baklunish Basin, the lands of the Tiger and Wolf Nomads are sometimes included, as they are populated by people of Baklunish stock. The basin is bordered to the east by the Crystalmist Mountains, Yatil Mountains, and Barrier Peaks, and to the south by the Sulhaut Mountains. To the north, it&apos;s bordered by the Dramidj Ocean and to the west its limits are defined by the Tyurzi Mountains. [ Bandit Kingdoms ] The Bandit Kingdoms are generally located in the central portion of the Flanaess. They are governed by various petty dictatorships theoretically owing fealty to Iuz. [ Bissel ] Bissel, properly known as the March of Bissel, is a political state of the Flanaess. Modern Bissel is generally located in the western-central portion of the Flanaess. It is bordered by the Barrier Peaks to the north and west, by the Dim Forest to the south, and by the Lorridges to the east. As of 591 CY, the most populous towns are Thornward, and Pellak (pop. 2,300). Thornward itself was once the capital of Bissel, but is now a town governed jointly by Bissel, Gran March, Ket, and Veluna (resulting from an agreement known as the Thornward Division). As of 591 CY, the population of Bissel totaled 123,880 persons, over 80% being humans of Oeridian, Suel, and Baklunish descent. Approximately 10% of the population is dwarven, with other humanoid races making up the remainder of the population. The most popular deities among Bissel&apos;s citizens are Heironeous, Zilchus, Fharlanghn, Geshtai, Rao, and Istus. The most widely-spoken languages in Bissel include Common, various Baklunish dialects, and Dwarven. Bissel is a feudal monarchy, and ruled by His Lofty Grace, Larrangin, the Margrave of Bissel, and owing fealty to Gran March and Veluna. The margrave is chosen by the leadership of the Knights of the Watch. In the Living Greyhawk campaign, Bissel corresponded to New England (the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine). The country itself is divided into twenty-six knight-baronies, eight townships, and one capital township, for the national capital of Pellak. Bissel&apos;s coat of arms is blazoned thus: Per pale indented gules and argent, over all a tower sable. Bissel is noted for producing foodstuffs, cloth, gold, and low-quality gems from mining operations. Bissel&apos;s standard coin age is modeled after Keoland&apos;s, and consists of the platinum griffon (pp), gold lion (gp), electrum eagle (ep), silver stag (sp), and copper roc (cp). [ Blackmoor ] The original Blackmoor began life in the early 1970s as the personal setting of Dave Arneson, the co-creator of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, first as a setting for Arneson&apos;s miniature wargames, then as an early testing ground for what would become D &amp; D. Though published in booklet form by Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) in 1975, as the second supplement to D &amp; D (the first being Greyhawk), Blackmoor actually predates Greyhawk as a campaign setting, a fact which Gary Gygax acknowledged in the foreword to the Blackmoor supplement. [ Dungeons &amp; Dragons Supplement II: Blackmoor Arneson, Dave 1975 TSR Rules Dave Arneson ] Blackmoor as a location within the Greyhawk setting came about both as an inside-joke by Gygax, and as a way for him to acknowledge his fellow writers&apos; creations ( Len Lakofka &apos;s Lendore Isles occupy a similar position in the world). Having certain locations exist across the campaign settings of multiple DMs also became a convenient way to explain how player characters such as Mordenkainen (Gygax&apos;s character) and Robilar ( Rob Kuntz &apos;s character) could be adventuring in Blackmoor&apos;s City of the Gods at one sitting, while exploring the dungeons of Castle Greyhawk the next. Modern Blackmoor is generally located in the northwestern portion of the Flanaess. It is a small and inhospitable realm lying almost completely within the boundaries of the northern reaches of the Cold Marshes. The Burneal Forest forms a western boundary of sorts, while the Land of Black Ice does the same to the north. As of 591 CY, the population of Blackmoor totaled 110,000 persons. Almost 40% of these inhabitants are humans of predominantly Flan and Oeridian stock, although some Suel and Baklunish can be found as well. Another 20% comprise orcish tribes that roam the region (some under the control of the Egg of Coot, some not). A slightly smaller percentage of halflings is also present, while elves, gnomes, half-orc s, half-elves, and other races make up the remainder of the population in increasingly smaller percentages. As of 591 CY, the most populous town is Dantredun (pop. 700) on the edge of the Burneal. Blackmoor Town, the original capital of the archbarony, was conquered and destroyed in 541 CY by the &quot; Egg of Coot &quot;, a mysterious being with a significant amount of magical power at his disposal. The &quot; town &quot; that serves as the Egg&apos;s home contains a number of automata (some reports place the number as high as 200), though very few living beings (if any) reside there The actual structure of Blackmoor&apos;s government is unknown. His Luminous Preponderancy, Archbaron Bestmo of Blackmoor claims the title of &quot; archbaron &quot;, and with it, rule over the ten underbaronies of the region. However, Teuod Fent, formerly of the Bandit Kingdoms, has claimed Ramshorn Castle as his own, and with it the title of &quot; baron &quot;. Nonhuman tribes also roam the area, though their allegiances are usually only to themselves. The national capital is Dantredun (the seat of Bestmo&apos;s power). [ Bone March ] The Bone March is a political state of the Flanaess. The Bone March is generally located in the eastern portion of the Flanaess. It rests in the narrow strip of land bounded by the Rakers in the west and the Teesar Torrent in the east, and curving around to encompass Johnsport on the coast of the Solnor Ocean. The cool, rocky farmland of the Bone March is relatively poor and never supported a dense population or large cities. Its farmlands are now desolate wilderness. As of 591 CY, the population of Bone March totaled 310,000 persons, though only a large minority are human (mainly Oeridian stock, but some Suel and Flan as well). About 20% of the population are orcs, and nearly the same number are halflings; gnomes, Elves, half-orc s, half-elves, and dwarves make up decreasing numbers of the remaining citizens. As of 591 CY, the most populous towns are Knurl (13,500), Spinecastle (pop. 6,300(?)), and Johnsport (pop. 3,500(?)). The numbers above do not take into account the large number of other uncounted goblins, gnoll s, etc. The most popular deities among Bone March&apos;s inhabitants are Hextor, the Oeridian agricultural gods, Erythnul, Kord, the orc pantheon, and Beltar. The most widely-spoken languages in Bone March include Common, Old Oeridian, Orc, Halfling, Gnomish, and Elven. Goblin, Gnoll, and other nonhuman languages are spoken as well, due to the large numbers of those races present in the land. Bone March was formerly a feudal marchland of the Great Kingdom, and ruled by His Nobility, Clement, the Marquis of Bone March; since 563 CY, it has been controlled by a conclave of nonhuman chiefs. The national capital is Spinecastle. Bone March&apos;s coat of arms is blazoned thus: Gules, three shin-bones, two in saltire, surmounted by one in pale, argent. Bone March is noted for producing silver and low- to average-quality gems. Bone March&apos;s coinage is based on Aerdy &apos;s standard, and consists of the platinum orb (pp), gold ivid (gp), electrum noble (ep), silver penny (sp), and copper common (cp). { Gygax, Gary.

Lake Geneva, WI: TSR, 1992 } [ Bright Lands ] the Bright Lands, properly known as the Empire of the Bright Lands, is a dictatorial political state of the Flanaess. The boundaries of the Bright Lands are contained entirely within the bounds of the Bright Desert. The Abbor Alz form the northern and eastern borders, while the Woolly Bay and the Sea of Gearnat form natural boundaries to the country&apos;s west and south. As of 591 CY, the population of the Bright Lands totaled 26,500 persons, the vast majority (almost 80%) being humans of mainly Flan descent. Dwarves account for the next largest group, with the remainder of the population (barely 1%) consisting of mostly centaurs. There is no state sponsored religion within the country. Among the Flan tribesmen, worship of Beory, Obad-Hai, and Pelor is most common. Geshtai and Istus are most popular with the few Paynim in the region, while a few scattered goblin tribes worship Maglubiyet and other deities of the goblin pantheon. The most widely-spoken languages in the Bright Lands are Flan and Ancient Suloise (by the native tribesmen), and various Baklunish dialects (by the Paynims). The Empire of the Bright Lands is a dictatorship with Rary of Ket as the head of state. The realm functions as a minor city-state administered from Rary&apos;s tower in the Brass Hills. Rary maintains his power with the assistance of Robilar, a powerful warrior who serves as commander of Rary&apos;s forces in the Empire. The state&apos;s coat of arms is blazoned thus: Gules, a gauntlet proper gripping a crescent or; on a chief azure three mullets argent. The Bright Lands does not currently produce its own coinage. [ County of Ulek ] The modern County of Ulek is generally located in the southwestern portion of the Flanaess, and is considered part of the Sheldomar Valley region. It is bordered by the Lortmil Mountains to the north and east, by the Old River to the east and south, and by the Kewl River to the West. As of 591 CY, the most populous towns are Jurnre (pop. 13,100), Kewlbanks (pop. 10,900), and Courwood (pop. 7,800). As of 591 CY, the population of the County of Ulek totaled 370,000 persons, the majority (almost 80%) being humans of Oeridian, Flan, and Suel descent. Gnomes are the next most populous group (8%), followed by halflings (6%, predominantly of the lightfoot variety), with the remainder being a mix of elves, dwarves, half-elves, and half-orc s. [ Duchy of Urnst ] [ Duchy of Urnst ] [ Empire of Iuz ] The Empire of Iuz is an empire ruled by the demigod Iuz. The Empire of Iuz is classified by the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer as an &quot; imperial theocratic dictatorship. &quot; Though Iuz holds all power, his rule is inconsistent. Iuz&apos;s priesthood and other spellcasters manage the affairs of the empire in his name. Iuz and his servants have more control over some regions of the empire than others. The capital of the empire is the city of Dorakaa. [ Administrative divisions ] The Empire of Iuz consists of five loosely-defined political regions, though they are not considered actual provinces. [ Land of Iuz ] Also called the Homeland of Iuz, this region lies mainly between the Dulsi and Opicim Rivers, south of the Cold Marshes, and north of Whyestil Lake. [ Bandit Lands ] Once referred to as the Bandit Kingdoms, this region lies west of the Zumker and Artonsamay Rivers, east of the Ritensa River, and is bounded in part by the Fellreev Forest and Bluff Hills. This region is actually made up of a number of warlord fiefs. [ Barren Lands ] These grasslands south of the Icy Sea and the Wastes are also known as the Barrens, the Barren Plains, or the Northern Barrens. North of the Bandit Lands, the Barrens&apos; eastern border is formed by the Forlorn Forest, western Griff Mountains, and the Bluff Hills. Their western border is formed by the Cold Marshes and Opicim River. Once ruled by the nomadic Flan tribes known as the Rovers of the Barrens, these people are but a shadow of their former glory. [ Horned Lands ] This region is bound by Whyestil Lake, the Veng and Ritensa Rivers, and the Fellreev Forest. These lands were for a time ruled by the Horned Society, before Iuz once again took control during the Greyhawk Wars. [ &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Shield Lands &quot; &gt; Shield Lands &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; /link &gt; ] Bordered by the Ritensa river, Nyr Dyv, and Rift Barrens, this land was ruled before the Greyhawk Wars by the chivalrous order known as the Knights of Holy Shielding. Though a western portion of the Shield Lands were reclaimed in the Great Northern Crusade of 586-588, the majority of the area is still under Iuz&apos;s control. [ Ferrond ] Ferrond most often refers to the former Great Kingdom province known as the Viceroyalty of Ferrond, or the general region where its successor states now lie. The Viceroyalty of Ferrond was a vassal state of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy, ruled by a viceroy in the name of the Overking. The capital of the Viceroyalty was the city of Dyvers. The Viceroyalty of Ferrond consisted of the modern-day states of Furyondy (Furyon), Highfolk, Perrenland (the Quaglands), the Shield Lands, Veluna (Voll), and the hilly regions northeast of the Vesve Forest, known then as part of the Northern Reaches. [ Free City of Greyhawk ] [ Free City of Greyhawk ] [ Frost Barbarians ] [ Frost Barbarians ] [ Geoff ] [ Geoff (Greyhawk) ] [ Gran March ] [ Gran March ] [ Great Kingdom ] [ Great Kingdom ] [ Highfolk ] [ Highfolk ] [ Ice Barbarians ] [ Ice Barbarians ] [ Land of Black Ice ] The Land of Black Ice is an arctic wasteland located in the northwestern Flanaess, north of the Burneal Forest and Blackmoor, east of the Drawmidj Ocean, and west of the Icy Sea. The land gets its name from the vast sheet of blue-black ice that covers it as far as the eye can see. The only humans living near the area are the Baklunish Guryik folk on the Drawmidj coast, and the Suloise Zeai, or Sea Barbarians, who dwell on a section of Icy Sea coastline known as the Tusking Strand. Within the Land of Black Ice proper are said to dwell all manner of horrid arctic monsters, so few humans enter the region. Tales are told of wights, frost men, evil spirits, black-skinned trolls, and blue-furred bugbears inhabiting the wasteland. The fabled City of the Gods is said to lie just outside the Land of Black Ice, near Blackmoor. Those few who have entered the city and escaped alive, among them Mordenkainen and Sir Robilar, tell tales of an artificially warm city of tall iron buildings, powerful magic, and strange automatons. Legends tell of another region beyond the ice, a land of lush jungles and an unmoving sun. Such legends give some reason to believe that the Oerth is hollow, containing another world within the inside of the globe, to which entry is gained via great openings in the poles. [ Nyrond ] Nyrond, or more properly the Kingdom of Nyrond, refers to one of the largest good-aligned states in the Flanaess. In 356 CY, the opportunist junior branch of the Aerdy Celestial House of Rax-Nyrond declared independence from the Overking of the Great Kingdom. Weakened by warfare against the likes of Ferrond, Perrenland, and Tenh, the scions of House Rax nonetheless amassed a large retribution-minded army to teach the upstart &quot; kingdom &quot; a lesson. At this moment, a coalition of Fruztii, Schnai and mercenary barbarians invaded North Province, distracting the Overking&apos;s army and allowing Nyrond critical time to entrench and train its military to repulse Aerdy military actions. For the next two centuries relations between the two states varied from open war to preparing for war. In 584 CY, during the Greyhawk Wars, Nyrond halted an invasion by the Great Kingdom after Ivid V &apos;s forces devastated Almor. Thereafter the Great Kingdom fell apart in magical disaster and civil war. Nyrond was in nearly as bad shape. After King Archbold III suffered a poison-induced stroke at the hands of his younger son in the fall of 585 CY, said son, Prince Sewarndt attempted to seize power. Sewarndt&apos;s coup was thwarted by his older brother, Crown Prince Lynwerd, who took the throne after Archbold abdicated in Fireseek of 586 CY, possibly the most popular decision of his time as ruler. Under Lynwerd, Nyrond has been slowly recovering, though times are good only by comparison to Archbold times. Lynwerd did take over much of Almor in 586 CY as the Great Kingdom fell apart. Nyrond lies between the Nesser River and Franz River to the west, the Harp River and Flinty Hills to the east, Relmor Bay to the south, and the Theocracy of the Pale to the north. Nyrond is ruled by King Lynwerd, who appoints all lesser officials. Nyrond&apos;s coat of arms is blazoned thus: Quarterly; 1st and 4th, ermine; 2nd and 3rd, gules, a sun radiated or. [ Nyrond in the Living Greyhawk campaign ] In the Living Greyhawk campaign, the following events took place in Nyrond: In early 595 CY another major revolt was successfully led by Sewarndt. He captured the capital city with the assistance of supernatural allies, and in the course of the assault he committed patricide. In autumn 595 CY, several campaigns around the country, led by Lynwerd&apos;s supporters and loyal nobles, succeeded in recapturing nearly all major provinces and cities. The reconquest ended in Sewarndt&apos;s death at the hands of his brother at the very gates of the Royal Palace in Rel Mord. Lynwerd is married to Queen Xenia Sallavarian of the Duchy of Urnst. Their daughter and heir was born in 595 CY. [ Plains of the Paynims ] The Plains of the Paynims, also known as the Paynims, is a political state and may also refer to the tribes of nomadic horsemen who live there. The plains are situated in the Baklunish Basin region of the Flanaess, west of Ket and south of Zeif. The native folk are Baklunish with mixed racial characteristics absorbed from subjugated travelers or settled merchants. There is no central authority; the government consists mainly of tribal khans and amirs ruled by progressively more powerful nobles (orakhans, ilkhans, or shahs) and royalty (padishahs, tarkhans, or kha-khans). There is great variation in governments between nomadic tribes. The coat of arms is blazoned thus: Gules, a scimitar per bend sinister or, in dexter chief a cross moline in saltire of the last. [ Pomarj ] [ Pomarj ] [ Rovers of the Barrens ] The Rovers of the Barrens, also known as the Barrens, and properly known as Arapahi (translated as &quot; People of the Plentiful Huntinglands &quot; ), is a political state of the Flanaess. The name also applies to the tribes of nomadic horsemen who dwell within these lands. [ Scarlet Brotherhood ] The Scarlet Brotherhood most often refers to the Great and Hidden Empire of the Scarlet Brotherhood, a nation located on the Tilvanot Peninsula in the southeastern Flanaess, though it can also refer to the secretive organization which rules that land. The Scarlet Brotherhood is described in great detail in the sourcebook The Scarlet Brotherhood (1999), by Sean K. Reynolds. { Reynolds, Sean K. The Scarlet Brotherhood (TSR, 1999) } [ Sheldomar Valley ] The Sheldomar Valley refers to the large swath of fertile land in southwestern Flanaess, bordered by the Barrier Peaks to the north, Crystalmists and Hellfurnaces to the west, Azure Sea to the south and the Lortmils to the east. The valley is named after the Sheldomar River, which runs through a good portion of its length. A number of nations make up the Sheldomar Valley, the largest being the Kingdom of Keoland. Other notable realms include Bissel, Geoff, the Gran March, the Hold of the Sea Princes, the Ulek States, the Valley of the Mage and the Yeomanry. The Sheldomar Valley was mentioned by Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report as a location travelled to by his player character, Farynieth.

It lies in a broad basin formed by the Stark Mounds to the north and northwest, by the Crystalmist Mountains to the west, and by the Jotens to the south. It is separated from the Kingdom of Keoland by the Javan River. Sterich is currently [ January 2009 ] ruled by Marquess Resbin Dren Emondav, a lawful neutral female human. The national capital is Istivin. The native folk of Sterich show strong Flan racial characteristics, tempered by Suel and Oeridian influences. Sterich&apos;s coat of arms is blazoned thus: Per fess dancetty gules and sable a lion rampant counterchanged.. { Gygax, Gary.

The ancestors of the Sulmi were nomads who lived in the grasslands where the Bright Desert lies today, living in harmony with the land and worshipping spirits of earth and air. Like most of the nomads in the region, they slowly became more sophisticated under the influence of the demigod Vathris. The Kingdom of Sulm came to prominence circa -1900 CY after it was bolstered by the necromantic adepts of Caerdiralor, who taught them dark secrets and promised wealth and glory in exchange for the favor of the Sulmi royal house. Throughout its history, the kingdom spent much of its time crushing its neighbors, the rival kingdoms of Durha, Itar, Ronhass, Rhugha, and Truun. Only the Kingdom of Itar was strong enough to stand against Sulm, though it, too, would eventually fall. After centuries of expansion, Sulm began its slow decline circa -1400 CY, some say [ January 2009 ] due to the influence of Nerull and other dark powers. Kyuss was a powerful priest of Nerull during Sulm&apos;s imperial age, shortly before its destruction. He was exiled for his profane experiments on undead in the sacred mortuary city of Unaagh, and traveled with hundreds of followers to the Amedio Jungle. In circa -700 CY the Kingdom of Sulm fell, destroyed by its last king. The king, Shattados, used the power of a dark artifact known as the Scorpion Crown in an attempt to gain perpetual dominion over his subjects. Instead, the crown turned Shattados into a gigantic scorpion and his people into manscorpions and (possibly) dune stalkers. A few became asheratis instead due to the grace of Geshtai. The land itself was even changed, transformed into a vast wasteland now known as the Bright Desert. { Broadhurst, Creighton. &quot; Into the Bright Desert. &quot; } { Dungeon #98 ( } { Paizo Publishing, 2003) } { Broadhurst, Creighton. &quot; Mysterious Places: Dominions of the Flannae. &quot; Wizards of the Coast website.

A cold, mountainous land, this region is best known for being the home of the nations of the Frost, Ice, and Snow Barbarians, as well as the nation of Stonehold. The peninsula is dominated by the Griff-Corusk mountain range, and is surrounded by the Icy Sea and the Solnor Ocean. The Thillonrian Peninsula was mentioned by Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report as a location travelled to by his player character, Farynieth.

The native folk of Ull are more or less pureblooded Baklunish. [ Verbobonc ] Verbobonc, properly known as the Viscounty and Town of Verbobonc, is a semi-independent nation of the Flanaess. Though Verbobonc owes fealty to the Archclericy of Veluna, it is nearly autonomous in practice. In the Living Greyhawk campaign, Verbobonc corresponds to the states of Illinois and Indiana. It pioneered a system for allowing Living Greyhawk player characters to develop towns, open businesses, and establish strongholds, something previously beyond the scope of the Living Greyhawk campaign. Player-created towns tend to reflect the personalities of the player characters who pool their resources to &quot; found &quot; a town. [ Wild Coast ] Little more than a collection of five major city-states for most of its history, the Wild Coast has long held a reputation for being untamed. Prior to the Greyhawk Wars, each city-state controlled its own affairs. However, things changed once Turrosh Mak gained control of the Pomarj. In 584 CY, Mak&apos;s forces marched north, taking the towns of Elredd, Badwall, and Fax, thus conquering the entire southern Wild Coast. The remaining towns of Safeton and Narwell escaped destruction only by swearing fealty to Greyhawk, resulting in the northern Wild Coast being absorbed into the Free City&apos;s domain. [ Yeomanry ] The modern Yeomanry is located in the southwestern portion of the Flanaess. It is nestled entirely within a broad basin bounded by the Jotens to the north, the Crystalmist Mountains to the west and south, and the Little Hills to the east. The valley passage between the Little Hills and the Tors leads directly into the Hool Marshes. A long cave system known as the Passage of Slerotin tunnels under the Hellfurnaces from the town of Dark Gate in the Yeomanry, finally emerging over 200 miles away into the Sea of Dust. [ Weather ] Except in the far north, temperatures reach below zero only in the winter months of Sunsebb and Fireseek and sometimes at night in late autumn and early spring. Even then temperatures seldom dip far below 0. The northeast and central regions of the Flanaess are the coldest, with winters extending into Ready&apos;reat and Readying. The warm currents of the Dramidj Ocean moderate the climate of the lands that border it. Summer typically lasts five or more months. Prevailing winds blow from the northeast in winter and autumn and from the southeast the rest of the year. Wintry northern winds are sometimes known as &quot; Telchur&apos;s breath, &quot; while easterly winds are sometimes called &quot; Atroa&apos;s laugh. &quot; Plentiful rainfall supports bountiful agriculture throughout most of the Flanaess.
