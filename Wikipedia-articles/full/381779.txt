Fan Man made headlines in the } { United States when he used his } { powered paraglider to fly into the arena, eventually crashing into the ring. } [ Background ] Born in Havre de Grace, Maryland, Miller was an avid outdoorsman, computer technician, small business owner, and extreme sports enthusiast who enjoyed power paragliding. He was introduced to paragliders while living in Las Vegas. [ Obituary Anchorage Daily News 2003-03-21 ] He started with a jetpack tied to his back and moved up to two-cycle aircraft engines that powered him through the skies above the desert. He began setting power-gliding records for altitude and distance and also obtained a reputation for reckless daring. After his publicized stunts, the Federal Aviation Administration threatened Miller with a lengthy sentence in a federal prison if he performed any more stunts. [ May 2010 ] Miller relocated to Valdez, Alaska where he continued to fly ultralight aircraft and paragliders in the Alaskan wilderness until he developed heart problems.He was diagnosed with a serious coronary condition, had heart surgery, and was forced to close his small computer business in Valdez in order to move to Anchorage, where he was closer to medical care and friends and family. [ The Fan Man Fight ] Miller&apos;s first and most famous stunt happened on November 6, 1993 during the heavyweight title fight between Riddick Bowe and Evander Holyfield. Miller descended into the second minute of the seventh round of the fight, after circling Caesar’s Palace for 10 minutes. The lines of his paraglider became tangled in the overhead lights. He landed on the top rope of the ring with his parachute still tangled in the lights. He tried to hang on with one foot and one hand on that top rope for a few seconds until he either fell or was dragged down into the crowd by spectators, his parachute ripping away from the lights above. Fans and the fighters&apos; security detail swarmed around him immediately and began attacking him. He was knocked unconscious during the attack. One security officer reportedly struck Miller twenty times. He was rushed to a nearby hospital as spectators cut his paraglider into pieces for souvenirs. After his release from the hospital, Miller was taken to the Clark County Detention Center, where he was charged with dangerous flying and released on $200 bail. &quot; It was a heavyweight fight, &quot; Miller would joke later, &quot; and I was the only guy who got knocked out. &quot; The media immediately dubbed Miller &quot; Fan Man, &quot; for the paramotor (lightweight engine and propeller) attached to his harness. Fox Sports Net ranked this incident as its #1 &quot; Most Outrageous Sports Moment, &quot; and in 1996 The Simpsons referenced the incident in its &quot; The Homer They Fall &quot; episode. [ Other stunts ] In January 1994, Miller flew into a Denver Broncos - Los Angeles Raiders NFL football game at the Coliseum in Los Angeles. He was arrested for interfering with a sporting event. After the game, Raiders defensive end Howie Long said that had Miller landed in the stands, the physical assault he received in Las Vegas would have paled in comparison as a result of Raider Nation &apos;s notorious raucousness. &quot; Magnify that beating tenfold. That&apos;s what he would have gotten here, &quot; Long said. In February 1994, he skydived into the middle of a soccer match in Bolton, England. After serving a prison sentence in the United Kingdom Miller was deported by British authorities. [ Death ] Miller was reported missing on September 22, 2002. On March 9, 2003, a group of hunters bushwhacking through the woods on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska found a decomposing body identified as that of James Miller. Police said he had chosen the remote Resurrection Pass Trail in Chugach National Forest, veering deep off-trail to a spot that might not have been discovered for years, if ever. Miller had hanged himself from a tree, and the death was ruled a suicide.
