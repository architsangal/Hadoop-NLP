[ 2011–12 Welsh Cup The Welsh Cup — taken before the 2007–08 Final. 1877 135 Wales England The New Saints (3rd time) Wrexham (23 times) ] The Welsh Cup ( [ Cwpan Cymru ] ) is a knock-out football competition contested annually by teams from Wales. The Football Association of Wales is the organising body of this competition, which has been run (except during the two World Wars ) every year since its inception in 1877–78. [ Welsh Cup Notes http://www.wfda.co.uk/welsh_cup_notes.php Welsh Football Data Archive 25 March 2011 ] In the early years of organised football in Wales, football was very much the sport of North Wales rather than the rugby union playing south – the FAW was founded in Ruabon, near Wrexham in 1876, and Wrexham remained the site of the FAW&apos;s head office until 1986; it was not until 1912 that a southern team, Cardiff City, won the Welsh Cup for the first time. The winning team qualifies to play in the following season&apos;s UEFA Europa League (previously teams qualified for the European Cup Winners&apos; Cup, which was discontinued in 1999). [ Participants ] Until 1995, some clubs playing in England close to the Welsh border were also invited to play in the Welsh Cup, but could not progress to the European Cup Winners&apos; Cup by winning the cup. From 1996 to 2011, only clubs playing in the Welsh football league system were allowed to enter the Welsh Cup. This rule excluded the six Welsh clubs who played in the English football league system : Swansea City, Cardiff City, Newport County, Wrexham, Colwyn Bay and Merthyr Town. On 20 April 2011, the Football Association of Wales invited these six clubs to rejoin the Welsh Cup for the 2011–12 season but only Newport County, Wrexham and Merthyr Town accepted. { Welsh cup exile over } In March 2012 UEFA stated that Welsh clubs playing in the English football league system could not qualify for Europen competitions via the Welsh cup but they could qualify via the English league and cup competitions. { Welsh clubs European qualification } [ History ] Between 1961–62 and 1984–85 seasons the final was played as a two-leg match, originally on a points basis rather than aggregate score. In the 1985–86 season it reverted to a single game, to be decided by extra time and penalties as necessary. The last English winner of the Welsh Cup was Hereford United in 1990.
