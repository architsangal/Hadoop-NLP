[ yes Canada 1990 ] Kingston Penitentiary (known locally as KP and Kingston Pen) is a maximum security prison located in Kingston, Ontario between King Street West and Lake Ontario. [ History ] Originally constructed in 1833–1834, and officially opened on June 1, 1835 as the &quot; Provincial Penitentiary of the Province of Upper Canada, &quot; it is one of the oldest prisons in continuous use in the world. Kingston Penitentiary is one of nine prisons in the Kingston area which range from low-security facilities to the maximum-security facilities Kingston Penitentiary and Millhaven Institution (which was initially built to replace Kingston Pen). The institution was built on land, described as &quot; Lot number twenty, in the first concession of the Township of Kingston &quot; The site was chosen for &quot; combining the advantages of perfect salubrity, ready access to the water, and abundant quantities of fine limestone. &quot; {. J. A. Edmison &apos;&apos;The History of Kingston Penitentiary&apos;&apos; Kingston, Ontario Queen&apos;s University. p. 25. Retrieved 2010-01-20 } Six inmates were accepted when the penitentiary was opened. The penitentiary&apos;s western wall adjoins the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour, which hosted the sailing events for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Immediately across the road to the north is the now closed Kingston Prison For Women (the property is now owned by Queen&apos;s University ), officially opened on January 24, 1934 to take female prisoners who had originally been housed in segregated quarters in the main facility. On August 15, 1954, a two-hour riot broke out in the penitentiary—the worst in its history up to that point { &quot; Fire and Riot sweep Kingston Penitentiary &quot;. The Lethbridge Herald, 16 August 1954, p.1 } —involving 900 inmates. During the riot a breakout was attempted, but was foiled by the guards at the gate. The trouble apparently began during a morning baseball game in the exercise yard, when a guard was attacked, followed by several inmates setting fire to various buildings in the yard, including the shops and a warehouse, causing an estimated $2 million in damages. The disturbance was quelled by the guards aided by 160 Canadian Army troops and a squad of RCMP officers. The 50 ringleaders were placed in solitary confinement. { &quot; Extra Guards Patrol Big Pen After Riot &quot;. Syracuse Herald Journal, 16 August 1954, p.7 } On April 14, 1971, a riot lasted four days and resulted in the death of two inmates and destruction of much of the prison. Security was substantially increased and prison reforms were instituted. From 1971–1981, the penitentiary served as Corrections Canada &apos;s Ontario Region Reception Centre. Today the facility houses between 350 and 500 inmates plus another 120 at R.T.C. (the Regional Treatment Centre) contained within the prison. Every inmate is given an individual cell. In 1990, Kingston Penitentiary was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. { Kingston Penitentiary, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada } [ 13265 Kingston Penitentiary ] In April 2012, the Government of Canada announced plans to close the penitentiary. { &quot; Kingston penitentiary in Ontario to close &quot;, CBC News.

After setting fire to a shed as a distraction, the gang used a ladder and went over the wall. They stole a car from a near by property and fled the city. { The Big Red Fox: The Incredible Story of Norman &quot; Red &quot; Ryan, Canada&apos;s Most Notorious Criminal by Peter McSherry (Paperback - Sep 1 1999) } In 1999, prisoner Ty Conn escaped from the prison. Although there have been at least 26 escape attempts since 1836, Conn was the first to succeed since 1958. Two weeks later, surrounded by police in Toronto, Conn committed suicide while speaking on the telephone to CBC producer Theresa Burke. { &apos;&apos;Who Killed Ty Conn&apos;&apos;.
