He first rose to fame with two lopsided victories in the 1951 Ryder Cup matches. He was subsequently selected for the 1953, 1955, 1957, and 1959 teams, serving as playing captain in 1957. He also served as non-playing captain in the 1973 matches, and as special assistant captain to Hal Sutton in 2004. Burke was born in Fort Worth, Texas. His father, Jack Burke, Sr., the pro at Houston &apos;s River Oaks Country Club, started him in golf at age seven. [ Member bio: Jack Burke, Jr. World Golf Hall of Fame http://www.worldgolfhalloffame.org/hof/member.php?member%3D1029 ] He turned professional in 1940. Burke served for four years with the Marines during World War II. After the war, he resumed his career in golf after first considering work in the oil fields of Texas. His first job was as a teaching pro in New Jersey, which was followed by a position as an assistant at Winged Foot Golf Club, [ A Champion of Golf Hauser, Melanie The Memorial Tournament magazine http://www.thememorialtournament.com/magazine/2009/MEM09_BURKE_WEB.pdf 2010-04-10 ] where he was mentored by Claude Harmon, and later club pro at Metropolis Country Club in White Plains, New York.

In his Masters victory, Burke came from eight strokes behind in the final round, with a 71 in heavy winds, to overtake amateur leader Ken Venturi, who shot 80. Perhaps his most famous match was his nine-hour, 40-hole quarterfinal loss to Cary Middlecoff in the 1955 PGA Championship. Burke won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average in 1952, a season in which he won four straight Tour events. He was selected PGA Tour Player of the Year in 1956. After retiring from competition, Burke, along with Jimmy Demaret, was the main force in creating and managing Houston&apos;s Champions Golf Club, a 36-hole facility which has been the site of many PGA Tour events, as well as the 1967 Ryder Cup, 1969 U.S. Open and 1993 U.S. Amateur. He became the fifth recipient of the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003, and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2000. Burke shares his permanent locker at Augusta National Golf Club, home of The Masters in Augusta, Georgia with Tiger Woods. As tradition dictates, both keep their prized green jackets, awarded to the annual winner of the tournament, in a wooden, finished locker with gold name plates on the front, with each year listed for the year they won. In recent years, Burke has coached several current PGA Tour stars, including Phil Mickelson, in putting, at which he is a renowned expert.
