It has member schools that range from New York, North Carolina, and Florida in the east to California in the west. The conference participates in the NCAA &apos;s Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) as a football -only conference. Unlike most other Division I FCS conferences, the Pioneer League consists of institutions that choose not to award athletic scholarship s ( &quot; grants-in-aid &quot; ) to football players. [ History ] [ Foundation ] Alternate Logo Following an NCAA rule change passed in January 1991, which required Division I schools to conduct all sports at the Division I level by 1993, the conference was formed by charter members Butler University, the University of Dayton, Drake University, the University of Evansville, and Valparaiso University. The University of San Diego joined in 1992, and the league played its first season in 1993. Talk of Creighton University and Bradley University joining the league in its origins never materialized by 1993. The six original schools which played in the 1993 season had previously sponsored football at the Division I, Division II and Division III levels. [ Membership changes ] Original contraction The league was narrowed back to five members after Evansville downgraded football from Division I to club status in 1997. Evansville explored upgrading football again to NCAA Division I in 2007, but plans fell through. Studies still continue about a possible football resurrection, which would most likely lead to Evansville re-joining the league. 2001 expansion In 2001, the conference nearly doubled in size and was reorganized with the five current members forming the North Division, and newcomers Austin Peay State University, Davidson College, Jacksonville University and Morehead State University forming the South Division. This reorganization also spawned a new championship system in which the best record holders from each division would play in a title game for the conference championship. 2005 –2008 membership changes On April 8, 2005, Austin Peay announced that it would be leaving the Pioneer Football League after the 2005 season and returning to scholarship-granting competition in 2007 with the Ohio Valley Conference in which it competes in other sports. As a result, the conference was reverted to round-robin play and the divisions and championship game were removed. However, on April 7, 2006 Campbell University announced it would bring back football at the non-scholarship level for the 2008 season, and on December 5, 2007 it accepted an invitation to the PFL. In February 2008, Marist College announced that it would join the PFL for the 2009 season, after the MAAC stopped sponsoring football. Although Campbell moved from the Atlantic Sun Conference to the Big South Conference, which sponsors football, in 2011, it did not join the Big South football conference and remains in the PFL.

That will bring the league&apos;s membership to 12 teams. { http://www.pioneer-football.org/news/default/21/602/ } [ Membership timeline ] DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:1991 till:2020 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:20 left:0 bottom:50 top:5 # &gt; to display a count on left side of graph, use &quot; left:20 &quot; to suppress the count, use &quot; left:20 &quot; &lt; # Colors = id:barcolor { id:line value:black } { id:bg value:white } { id:Full value:rgb(0.742,0.727,0.852) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports } { id:FullxF value:rgb(0.551,0.824,0.777) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports except for football } { id:AssocF value:rgb(0.98,0.5,0.445) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member for football only } { id:AssocOS value:rgb(0.5,0.691,0.824) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in some sports, but not all (consider identifying in legend or a footnote) } { id:OtherC1 value:rgb(0.996,0.996,0.699) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference } { id:OtherC2 value:rgb(0.988,0.703,0.383) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference where OtherC1 has already been used, to distinguish the two } PlotData= { width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s } { bar:1 color:Full from:1991 till:end text: } { Butler (1991 –present) } { bar:2 color:Full from:1991 till:end text: } { Dayton (1991 –present) } { bar:3 color:Full from:1991 till:end text: } { Drake (1991 –present) } { bar:4 color:Full from:1991 till:1997 text: } { Evansville (1991 –1997) } { bar:5 color:Full from:1991 till:end text: } { Valparaiso (1991 –present) } { bar:6 color:Full from:1992 till:end text: } { San Diego (1992 –present) } { bar:7 color:Full from:2001 till:2008 text: } { Austin Peay (2001 –2006) } { bar:8 color:Full from:2001 till:end text: } { Davidson (2001 –present) } { bar:9 color:Full from:2001 till:end text: } { Jacksonville (2001 –present) } { bar:10 color:Full from:2001 till:end text: } { Morehead State (2001 –present) } { bar:11 color:Full from:2008 till:end text: } { Campbell (2008 –present) } { bar:12 color:Full from:2009 till:end text: } { Marist (2009 –present) } { bar:13 color:Full from:2013 till:end text: } { Mercer (2013 –present) } { bar:14 color:Full from:2013 till:end text: } { Stetson (2013 –present) } ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:5 start:1991 TextData = { fontsize:L } { textcolor:black } { pos:(0,30) tabs:(400-center) } { text:^ &quot; Pioneer Football League Membership History &quot; } [ 190 186 218 ] [ 141 211 199 ] [ 251 128 114 ] [ 128 177 211 ] [ 255 255 179 ] [ 253 180 98 ] &gt; If the chart uses more than one bar color, add a legend by selecting the appropriate fields from the following six options (use only the colors that are used in the graphic.)

In addition, league members are allowed to accept at-large invitations to other college bowl games and teams are eligible to compete in the FCS playoffs, but can only receive at-large bids because the league is not an automatic qualifier. As of 2011, the NCAA has never invited any PFL team to the tournament. The PFL was a participant in the NCAA Division I FCS Consensus Mid-Major Football National Championship, along with the Northeast Conference and Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, two other conferences without automatic playoff bids. The Consensus championship has since been discontinued; the NEC now has an automatic playoff bid, while the MAAC no longer sponsors football.
