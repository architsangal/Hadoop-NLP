(born 1 June 1935) is a British architect whose company maintains an international design practice, Foster + Partners. Foster was raised in Manchester in a working-class family and was intrigued by design and engineering from a young age. His years observing Mancunian architecture subsequently influenced his works, and was inspired to pursue a career in architecture after a treasurer clerk noticed his sketches and interest in Manchester&apos;s buildings while he worked at Manchester Town Hall. [ Norman Foster: A life in architecture 30 Sudjic Deyan Weidenfeld 2010 978-0-297-85868-3 ] Foster gained an internship at a local architect&apos;s office before submitting a portfolio and winning a place at the University of Manchester School of Architecture. He subsequently won a scholarship to study at the Yale School of Architecture in the United States of America. Foster returned to the United Kingdom in 1963 and set up a practice, Team 4 which became Foster + Partners. His breakthrough building was arguably the Willis Building in Ipswich in 1975 and he has since designed landmark structures such as Wembley Stadium and 30 St Mary Axe. He is one of Britain&apos;s most prolific architects of his generation. { Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 } In 1999 he was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize, often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.

[ Biography ] [ Early life in Manchester ] Foster was born to Robert Foster and Lilian Smith [ Sudjic 11 ] in 1935 in Reddish (now part of Greater Manchester), Stockport. Foster has no recollection of Reddish as his parents rented a terraced house, 4 Crescent Grove in Levenshulme for fourteen- shillings a week soon after his birth. [ Norman Foster: A Life in Architecture by Deyan Sudjic http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/23/norman-foster-biography-book-review The Observer 23 May 2010 6 October 2011 London Moore Rowan ] Foster&apos;s parents were diligent, hard workers - so diligent that Foster, an only child, felt their heavy workload restricted his relationship with them and he was often looked after by neighbours or other family members. [ Sudjic 19 ] He attended Burnage Grammar School (now Burnage High School ) in Burnage. He said he always felt &apos;different&apos; at school and was bullied. [ The Guardian Profile: Sir Norman Foster: The master builder http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1999/jan/02/books.guardianreview10 The Guardian 2 January 1999 6 October 2011 London ] He retired into the world of books and was quiet and awkward in his early years making faux pas. [ Book review: Norman Foster: A Life in Architecture http://www.scotsman.com/features/Book-review-Norman-Foster-A.6357545.jp scotsman.com 13 June 2010 6 October 2011 ] { Alfred Waterhouse &apos;s } { Manchester Town Hall, where Foster worked as a junior clerk. } { art deco } { Daily Express Building in Manchester was a building that intrigued him. } Manchester was &apos;one of the workshops of the world&apos; during his childhood, and &apos;the embodiment of a great city&apos;. [ Sudjic 32 ] His father, Robert, worked at Metropolitan Vickers at Trafford Park which fuelled his interest in engineering and design. As a youngster, he was fascinated with engineering and the process of designing which caused him to pursue a career designing buildings. [ Taller, higher, bigger, Foster http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2005/oct/24/architecture The Guardian 24 October 2005 5 October 2011 London ] Specific interests included aircraft, a hobby he maintains today; and trains, generated by viewing passing trains on the railway outside his terraced home during his childhood. Foster was not keen on sports, but frequently cycled to the Lake District from Manchester and back the same day. [ Norman Foster at 75: Norman&apos;s conquests Glancey Jonathan http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/jun/29/norman-foster-interview The Guardian 29 June 2010 2012-03-04 ] Foster&apos;s father convinced him to take the entrance exam for Manchester Town Hall&apos;s trainee scheme [ Sudjic 27 ] which he passed in 1951 and took a job as an office junior in the Treasurer&apos;s Department. His parents were pleased, but he was disappointed. Bored with office work, he ventured into the city to observe buildings during his lunch breaks and sketched designs while at his desk. A clerk, Mr Cobb became aware of Foster&apos;s interests. Cobb&apos;s son was studying architecture and his interest led to Foster considering a career in architecture. [ Sudjic 30 ] After working in the Manchester City Treasurer&apos;s office Foster completed his National Service in 1953 serving in the Royal Air Force, a choice inspired by his passion for aircraft. [ Sudjic 34 ] Foster returned to Manchester, not wanting to return to the town hall as his parents wished and unsure of which path to follow. [ Sudjic 35 ] With 7 O-levels, he applied for a job at a duplicating office machine company and when asked by the interviewer why he applied, Foster replied: &apos;mainly because it offered the prospect of a company car, and a £1,000 salary.&apos; [ Sujic 36 ] Foster was searching for a world away from his working-class roots which led the alienation of his parents. [ Sudjic 37 ] [ Education ] After failing to gain a job, Foster was led to John Beardstow, a local architect in Manchester. After a successful interview, he gained a job as an assistant to a contract manager at the practice. [ Sudjic 36 ] Foster was unsure how to become an architect, and if it was even possible coming from a working class background where money for tuition was slim. Nevertheless, he queried colleagues at the architecture practice for advice on how to become an architect. Advised to create a portfolio to hand to an architecture school, he took various drawings, such as perspective and shop drawing s from Beardstow&apos;s practice as inspiration. [ Sudjic 39 ] Foster intended to submit this portfolio to an architectural school in the hope of gaining, however inadvertently Beardstow was so impressed with the drawings he promoted the young Foster to the drawing department of the practice. [ Sudjic 40 ] However after trying to convince Foster to stay and learn his trade as an architect at Beardstow&apos;s, Foster declined and wanted to pursue a place at an architecture school. After he was discharged, in 1956 Foster won a place at the University of Manchester School of Architecture and City Planning. Foster failed to get a grant to help fund his studies, and being from a working-class background money was at a minimum. He took up a number of part time jobs to fund his studies in Architecture. [ Norman Foster: Building the future http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/742087.stm BBC News 9 May 2000 5 October 2011 ] His jobs in his teenage years included being an ice-cream salesman, night-club bouncer and working night shifts at the local bakery to make crumpets. He combined these with self-tuition via visits to the local library in Levenshulme. [ Architect&apos;s Levenshulme inpsiration http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1076763_architects_levenshulme_inpsiration Manchester Evening News 30 October 2008 5 October 2011 Thistlethwaite Laura M.E.N. Media ] Foster took a keen interest in the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer and graduated from Manchester in 1961. Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he met future business partner Richard Rogers and earned his Master&apos;s degree. Vincent Scully encouraged Foster and Rogers to travel in America for a year. { How much does your building weigh, Mr. Foster?, Sternstunde Kultur, Schweizer Fernsehen, 4 December 2011. } After returning to the UK in 1963 he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams allowing them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design. [ Foster and Partners ] { Willis Faber and Dumas Headquarters in } { Ipswich was one of Foster&apos;s earliest commissions after founding } { Foster Associates. } After Team 4 went their separate ways, Foster and Wendy Cheesman founded Foster Associates, which later became Foster and Partners in 1967. A long period of collaboration with American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller began in 1968 and continued until Fuller&apos;s death in 1983. They collaborated on several projects that became catalysts in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design – including the Samuel Beckett Theatre project. Originally they concentrated on industrial buildings. The turning point was the 1969 administrative and leisure center for Fred Olsen, in London, where workers and managers are not separated any more. Foster and Partners&apos; breakthrough building in the UK was the Willis Faber &amp; Dumas headquarters in Ipswich, of 1974. The client was a family run insurance company which wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace. Foster created open-plan office floors long before open-plan became the norm. In a town not over-endowed with public facilities, the roof gardens, 25 metre swimming pool and gymnasium enhanced the quality of life for the company&apos;s 1200 employees. [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/nationaltreasures/2188199/Lord-Norman-Foster-portrait.html Lord Norman Foster portrait The Telegraph 24 June 2008 1 October 2011 London Telegraph Media Group ] The building has a full-height glass facade moulded to the medieval street plan and contributes drama, subtly shifting from opaque, reflective black to a glowing backlit transparency as the sun sets. The design was inspired by the Daily Express Building in Manchester a work Foster admired in his youth. The building is now Grade One listed. The HSBC Building in Hong Kong. Designed by Foster in the 1980s Foster gained a reputation for designing office buildings. In the 1980s he designed the HSBC Main Building in Hong Kong for HSBC. The building is marked by its high level of light transparency, as all 3500 workers have a view to Victoria Peak or Hong Kong bay and the Chinese mainland. [ Norman Foster Treiber Daniel E &amp; FN Spon 1995 76 ] Foster said that if the firm had not won the contract it would probably have been bankrupted. Foster believes that attracting young talent is essential, and is proud that the average age of people working for Foster and Partners is 32, just like it was in 1967. [ Present day ] { 30 St Mary Axe. The building serves as the London headquarters for } { Swiss Re and is informally known as &apos; } { The Gherkin &apos;. } Foster was assigned the brief for a development on the site of the Baltic Exchange in the 1990s. The Exchange was damaged beyond repair by a bomb left by the IRA. Foster + Partners submitted a plan for a 385 metre tall skyscraper, the London Millenium Tower, but its height was seen as excessive for London&apos;s skyline. [ London Millenium Tower http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav%3Dbuilding%26amp%3Blng%3D3%26amp%3Bid%3D102960 Emporis 10 October 2011 ] The proposal was scrapped and instead Foster proposed 30 St Mary Axe, &quot; the gherkin &quot; due to its design which alluded to its shape. Foster worked with engineers to integrate complex computer systems with the most basic physical laws, such as convection. Green, sustainable energy ideas include the complex facade which lets in air for passive cooling and vents it as it warms and rises. Foster&apos;s earlier designs reflected a sophisticated, machine-influenced high-tech vision. His style has evolved into a more sharp-edged modernity. In 2004, Foster designed the tallest bridge in the world, the Millau Viaduct in southern France, with the Millau Mayor Jacques Godfrain stating; &quot; The architect, Norman Foster, gave us a model of art. &quot; [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4091813.stm France shows off tallest bridge BBC News 14 December 2004 1 October 2011 ] In January 2007, The Sunday Times reported that Foster had called in Catalyst, a corporate finance house, to find buyers for Foster + Partners. Foster does not intend to retire, but sell his 80–90% holding in the company valued at £300M to £500M.
