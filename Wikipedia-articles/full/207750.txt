Based on his prior service as an officer in the United States Navy, Robinson earned the nickname &quot; The Admiral &quot;. He and teammate power forward Tim Duncan were nicknamed &quot; The Twin Towers &quot;. Robinson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame along with Michael Jordan, John Stockton, Jerry Sloan, and C. Vivian Stringer [ http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-hall-of-fame11-2009sep11%2C0%2C5971777.story ] [ September 2010 RjwilmsiBot ] on September 11, 2009. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest centers in NBA history. [ http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page%3Ddailydime-greatestcenters The game&apos;s greatest giants ever ESPN.com March 6, 2007 2011-01-25 ] [ Early life ] David Robinson was born August 6, 1965, in Key West, Florida, the second child of Ambrose and Freda Robinson. Since Robinson&apos;s father was in the Navy, the family moved many times. After his father retired from the Navy, the family settled in Woodbridge, Virginia, where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball. He was 5  feet, 9  inches tall in junior high school so he tried his hand at basketball, but soon quit. Robinson attended Osbourn Park High School in Manassas, Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C., where Robinson&apos;s father was working as an engineer after retiring from the Navy. By his senior year in high school he was 6  feet, 7  inches tall, but he had not played organized basketball. When the coach added the tall senior to the basketball team, Robinson earned all-area and all-district honors but generated little interest among college basketball coaches. Robinson scored a 1320 on the SAT, and he chose to go to the U.S. Naval Academy, where he majored in mathematics. [ College basketball career and military service ] David Robinson is widely considered to be the best basketball player in U.S. Naval Academy history. { According to the following article about the city of Annapolis, Robinson won the &quot; Eastman Award &quot; in 1987 and the award is in Lejeune Hall. } [ Bailey Steve In Annapolis, Md., the Past Is Always at Hand New York Times August 22, 2008 http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/travel/escapes/22american.html?pagewanted%3Dprint 2010-03-18 ] { See also the footnote at } { United States Naval Academy#Halls and principal buildings (at &quot; Lejeune Hall &quot; ). } He chose the jersey number 50 after his idol Ralph Sampson. By the time he took the court in his first basketball game for the Navy Midshipmen men&apos;s basketball team, he had grown to 6  ft 9  in (2.06  m), and over the course of his college basketball career he grew to 7  ft 0  in (2.13  m).

Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under Paul Evans (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and under former University of Georgia interim Head Coach Pete Herrmann during his senior season. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the 1987 NBA Draft and was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to wait two years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy. Robinson was 6  ft 8  in when he was admitted to the Naval Academy, two inches above the height limit, but received a waiver from the Superintendent of the Academy. Robinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve in active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the Superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent serving at sea as an unrestricted line officer, hurting his naval career, and might not make it possible for him to be commissioned at all. As a compromise, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman placed Robinson in a program for training civil engineer s for the Naval Reserves that reduced his active-duty obligation to two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia.

In March 2012, Corey Robinson announced that he would be attending Notre Dame to play football. [ NBA career ] Although there was speculation that Robinson might choose not to sign with the Spurs and to become a free agent once his Navy commitment ended, [ Dave Anderson Sports of the Times; The Robinson Plot Thickens http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res%3DF4071EFE385A0C7B8DDDAC0894DF484D81 New York Times May 18, 1987 ] [ Tom Orsborn The Summer Our Ship Came In San Antonio Express-News May 20, 2007 ] Robinson decided in the end to come to San Antonio. Robinson joined the Spurs for the 1989–90 season, and led the Spurs to the greatest single season turnaround in NBA history at the time [ http://www.nba.com/history/players/robinson_bio.html NBA.com: David Robinson Bio ] (a record the Spurs themselves broke in 1997-98, after drafting Tim Duncan, which was then broken by the Boston Celtics in the 2007–08 NBA season ). The Spurs went from 21–61 [ http://www.nba.com/history/standings/19881989.html NBA.com: 1988-89 Standings ] in the 1988–89 season to 56–26 in 1989–90, for a remarkable 35 game improvement. They advanced to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs where they lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers. Following the 1989–90 season, he was unanimously named the NBA rookie of the year, and subsequently Sega produced a game featuring him entitled David Robinson&apos;s Supreme Court. The Spurs made the playoffs seven more seasons in a row, but never advanced further than the Western Conference finals. Robinson also made the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team that won the gold medal in Barcelona. During the 1993–94 season, he became locked in a duel for the NBA scoring title with Shaquille O&apos;Neal, scoring 71 points (breaking George Gervin &apos;s single-game franchise record of 63 on the final day of the 1977-78 NBA season ) against the Los Angeles Clippers to win it. { www.basketball-reference.com, San Antonio (112) @ LA Clippers (97) (April 24, 1994) } Robinson went on to win the MVP trophy in 1995, and in 1996 he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. [ http://www.nba.com/history/players/50greatest.html NBA.com: The NBA at 50 ] Still, from 1991 to 1996, Robinson was thwarted in his quest to claim the one prize that had eluded him: an NBA title. During that span the Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Warriors, Suns (twice), Jazz (twice), and Rockets. The loss against the Rockets was particularly painful for Robinson because it occurred in the Western Conference Finals with Robinson playing head-to-head against his chief rival, Hakeem Olajuwon. By his own admission, Robinson was outplayed by Olajuwon in the series, their only meetings in post-season play. Early in the 1997 season, Robinson&apos;s dreams of becoming a champion seemed to vanish when he was seriously injured. Robinson hurt his back in the preseason. He did return to play, but six games later, suffered a broken foot in a home game against the Miami Heat, and ended up missing the rest of the regular season. As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players, the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20 –62 record. However, his injury proved to be a blessing in disguise: due to their dismal record in 1997, the Spurs enjoyed the first pick in the next year&apos;s NBA draft, and with it they selected Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest University, who was, after a few years, the final key to Robinson&apos;s quest for an NBA title. [ Champion ] Before the start of the 1998 –99 season, the NBA owners and the NBA commissioner David Stern locked out the NBA Players&apos; Association to force negotiations on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. This lockout lasted for 202 days, well into the regular NBA season, before an agreement was finally reached. After playing a truncated 50-game season, the Spurs finished with an NBA-best record of 37–13, giving them the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. The Spurs blitzed through the first three rounds of the NBA playoffs, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Lakers, and Portland Trail Blazers by a combined record of 11–1. In the NBA finals, the combination of Robinson in the post and second-year, 6  ft 11 in (2.11  m) Tim Duncan proved overpowering, the Spurs beat the underdog New York Knicks in five games to become the NBA champions for the first time. Duncan was named Finals MVP. { NBA.com:&apos;Spurs Tower Over NBA&apos; accessed July 11, 2008 } [ Champion again ] Robinson announced he would retire from basketball after the 2002 –03 campaign. On June 15, 2003, in the finale to Robinson&apos;s career, the Spurs sealed another NBA title with an 88–77 victory over the New Jersey Nets in Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals. Turning back the clock, Robinson scored 13 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in his final game for the Spurs. He and the year&apos;s regular season and NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan shared Sports Illustrated magazine&apos;s 2003 Sportsmen of the Year award. Robinson averaged 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game over 987 games in his NBA career. Also, he is one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in the NBA, as well as being one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double (with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks against the Detroit Pistons on February 17, 1994), and one of the only five players to record more than 70 points in a single game (with 71 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 24, 1994), only Elgin Baylor (71 points), Wilt Chamberlain (70, 72, 73 twice, 78, 100 points), David Thompson (73 points), and Kobe Bryant (81 points) have scored more than 70 points. [ http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page%3Ddailydime-060123 ESPN.com - NBA - Kobe makes records wilt ] Robinson is also noteworthy for his harmonious relationship with Tim Duncan. Sportswriter Chris Sheridan noted that it was rare for someone like Robinson to have welcomed and mentored Duncan as willingly as he did.

In 1991, Robinson visited with fifth graders at Gates Elementary School in San Antonio and challenged them to finish school and go to college. He offered a $2,000 scholarship to everyone who did. In 1998, proving even better than his word, Robinson awarded $8,000 to each of those students who had completed his challenge. In perhaps his greatest civic and charitable achievement, David and his wife, Valerie, founded the Carver Academy in San Antonio, which opened its doors in September 2001. To date, the Robinsons have donated more than $11 million to the school.
