{ Wanka } [ the pejorative ] [ wanker ] Wanker is a pejorative term of English origin, common in Commonwealth and ex-Commonwealth countries, including Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. It initially referred to an onanist but has since become a general insult. It is synonym ous with tosser. [ Meaning ] The term wanker originated from British slang in the 1940s. { Online Etymology Dictionary } Wanker literally means &quot; one who wanks ( masturbates ) &quot;. In modern usage it is usually a general insult. It conveys contempt, not commentary on sexual habits. Wanker has similar meanings and overtones to American pejoratives like jerk(-off). { Etherington, Mike: The very Best of British The American&apos;s guide to speaking British } It is sometimes found in the phrase intellectual wanker, alluding to an individual who appears to indulge in obscurantist language and sophistry with the principal aim of promoting his own self-perceived intelligence (or concealing his intellectual weakness). More generally, wanker can carry suggestions of egotist ical and self-indulgent behaviour (analogous to American douche(bag) { http://www.thefrisky.com/post/246-how-to-have-the-most-expensive-day-of-your-life/?sms_ss=facebook } ): this is the dominant meaning in Australia and New Zealand. { Ludowyk, Frederick: Anatomy of Swearing } &quot; Wanker &quot; hand gesture Wanker may be indicated by a one-handed gesture, { How to make a Wanker gesture and how not to make it } usually to an audience out of hearing range.

Such wankers are impervious to criticism because they&apos;re always doing battle with straw critics. They never remember what they said last week, and assume you won&apos;t either. &quot; { Atrios, &quot; The One True Wanker of the Decade: Tom Friedman &quot;, April 17, 2012. } [ Differences in perceived levels of offensiveness ] In December 2000, the Advertising Standards Authority published research on attitudes of the British public to pejoratives.
