Its capital is the city of Vladikavkaz. Its population according to the 2010 Census was 712,980. [ 2010Census ] [ Name ] In the last years of the Soviet Union, as nationalist movements swept throughout the Caucasus, many intellectuals in the North Ossetian ASSR called for the revival of the name of Alania, a medieval kingdom of the Alans, ancestors of the modern-day Ossetians. The term of &quot; Alania &quot; quickly became popular in Ossetian daily life through the names of various enterprises, a TV channel, political and civic organizations, publishing house, soccer team, etc. In November 1994, the name of &quot; Alania &quot; was officially added to the republican title (Republic of North Ossetia–Alania). { Shnirelman, Victor (2006). The Politics of a Name: Between Consolidation and Separation in the Northern Caucasus. Acta Slavica Iaponica 23, pp. 37-49. } [ History ] [ History of North Ossetia–Alania ] [ Early history ] The territory of North Ossetia was first inhabited by Caucasian tribes. Some Nomad ic Alans settled in the region in the 7th century, forming the kingdom of Alania. It was converted to Christianity by missionaries from Byzantium. Alania greatly profited from the Silk Road which passed through its territory. After the Middle Ages, the Mongols &apos; and Tartars &apos; repeated invasions decimated the population, now known as the Ossetians. Islam was introduced to the region in the 17th century by Kabard ians. Conflicts between the Khanate of Crimea and the Ottoman Empire eventually pushed Ossetia into an alliance with Imperial Russia in the 18th century. Soon, Russia established a military base in the capital, Vladikavkaz, making it the first Russian-controlled area in the northern Caucasus. By 1806, Ossetia was under complete Russian control. [ Russian/Soviet rule ] Border changes after World War II The Russians&apos; rule led to rapid development of industry and railways which overcame its isolation. The first books from the area came during the late 18th century, and became part of the Terskaya Region of Russia in the mid-19th century. The Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in North Ossetia being merged into the Soviet Mountain Republic in 1921. It then became the North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast on 7 July 1924, then merged into the North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 5 December 1936. In World War II, it was subject to a number of attacks by Nazi German invaders unsuccessfully trying to seize Vladikavkaz in 1942. The North Ossetian SSR declared itself the autonomous republic of the Soviet Union on June  20, 1990. Its name was changed to Republic of North Ossetia–Alania in 1991. [ Post-Soviet rule ] The Soviet Union&apos;s collapse posed particular problems for the Ossetian people, who were divided between North Ossetia, which was part of the Russian SFSR, and South Ossetia, part of the Georgian SSR. In December 1990 the Supreme Soviet of Georgia abolished the autonomous Ossetian enclave amid the rising ethnic tensions in the region, and much of the population fled across the border to North Ossetia or Georgia proper. Some 70,000 South Ossetian refugees were resettled in North Ossetia, sparking clashes with the predominantly Ingush population in the Prigorodny District. That led to the Ossetian–Ingush conflict. As well as dealing with the effects of the conflict in South Ossetia, North Ossetia has had to deal with refugees and the occasional spillover of fighting from the war in neighboring Chechnya. The bloodiest incident by far was the September 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, in which Chechen insurgents attributed to Shamil Basayev (who alternatingly denied and claimed responsibility) seized control of a school. In the firefight between the terrorists and Russian forces that ended the crisis, 335 civilians, the majority of them children, died.
