{ Laurier Golden Hawks won the } { 2005 Vanier Cup, defeating } { Saskatchewan 24–23. } The Vanier Cup (in [ Coupe Vanier ] ) is the name of the championship of Canadian Interuniversity Sport football and the name of the trophy awarded to the victorious team. It is currently played between the winners of the Uteck Bowl and the Mitchell Bowl. It is named after Georges Vanier, the former Governor General of Canada and was first awarded in 1965 to the winner of an invitational event contested between two teams that were selected by a panel. In 1967, the trophy was declared the official &quot; CIAU (now CIS) National Football Championship &quot; and a playoff system was instituted. From its creation until 1982, it was known as the Canadian College Bowl. The game typically occurs in late November, although it is occasionally played in December. The 2011 Vanier Cup game was played at BC Place in Vancouver for the first time. It was played between the McMaster Marauders and the Laval Rouge et Or. McMaster won the game 41–38 and captured their first championship in school history. The Western Ontario Mustangs and Laval Rouge et Or have won the most Vanier Cups (6), while Western has the most appearances (12). Seventeen teams have won the Vanier Cup, while three others have played for the championship but never won. There are seven active teams that have never appeared in the championship game. [ History ] Logo for the 2011 Vanier Cup in Vancouver The Vanier Cup was created in 1965 as the championship trophy of the Canadian College Bowl. For the first two years of competition, the Canadian College Bowl was an invitational event, with a national panel selecting two teams to play, much like the system employed by American college football today. In 1967, the Canadian College Bowl was declared the national football championship of the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union, now Canadian Interuniversity Sport, with a playoff system determining the two participants.

However, after the CIS opened the game to host conference bids in 2001, the possibility arose to have games held outside Toronto. The 2004, 2005 and 2008 games were hosted by the OUA at Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton, and the 2006 game was hosted by the University of Saskatchewan at Griffiths Stadium in Saskatoon.

It was first awarded at the first championship in 1965 and named in honour of Teddy Morris, who died the same year. Morris, a Hall of Fame former Toronto Argonauts player and coach, was an organizer of the first bowl and champion for developing Canadian players. The Bruce Coulter Award was first awarded in 1992 and is dependent on what position the winner of the Ted Morris Trophy played. If the winner is from the offence, then the Bruce Coulter Award winner will be the most outstanding defensive player or vice-versa. It was named after Bruce Coulter, long-time Head Coach at Bishop&apos;s University and former offensive and defensive player with the Montreal Alouettes in the 1950s. Coulter was inducted as a builder in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1997.
