While there she did her first nude layout, but they eventually returned to Virginia. The layout brought an offer to shoot her first porn film, a short, in Baltimore. She and Yontz subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where she devoted herself to the pursuit of her career in porn, initially using the name &quot; Sweet Alice &quot; as well as &quot; Linda Grasser. &quot; { PopMatters.com } She eventually adopted the screen name Seka, after a female blackjack dealer she knew in Las Vegas.
