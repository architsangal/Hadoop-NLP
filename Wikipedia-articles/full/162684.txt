Ken was created by Tony Warren as one of Coronation Street&apos;s original characters. He debuted in the soap&apos;s first episode on 9 December 1960. [ Corrie&apos;s Bill will mark half century http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century Metro ( Associated Newspapers ) 29 April 2011 7 November 2008 ] Having appeared continuously since the programme&apos;s inception, December 2010 marked Ken&apos;s 50th anniversary on-screen. At this time, Roache officially became the longest-serving actor in a televised soap opera. Roache was honoured at the 2010 Guinness World Records ceremony for the achievement, when he surpassed actor Don Hastings from the American soap opera As the World Turns, who previously held this title. Roache stated in 2010 that he has no plans to leave the role and will remain in Coronation Street for as long as they will have him. Ken was introduced as the educated son of a working-class family. Portrayed as moralistic and a political activist, Ken differed from the other, predominantly working-class characters in the soap opera. The character developed a reputation as a ladies&apos; man; plots saw Ken dating numerous women, marrying five times to four women ( Valerie Tatlock in 1962, Janet Reid in 1972 and Deirdre Hunt in 1981 and again in 2005), fathering four children ( Susan Barlow, Peter Barlow, Lawrence Cunningham and Daniel Osbourne; with Laurence and Daniel sharing a 34 year age gap, the longest in any soap), and adopting one daughter ( Tracy Barlow ). [ Moss John Coronation Street, Granada Television, Manchester http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century Manchester UK 29 April 2011 2002 ] Of the many women Ken has been paired on-screen with, his relationship with Deirdre has been the most enduring. Ken and Deirdre&apos;s fictional relationship made newspaper headlines in Britain in 1983 due to Deirdre&apos;s adultery with Mike Baldwin. The storyline captured both media and viewer interest. 20 million people tuned in to watch Ken&apos;s discovery of the affair. The storyline lead to a feud between Ken and Mike, prominent in both characters&apos; narratives until Mike&apos;s screen death in 2006. Despite his somewhat antagonistic role in the show&apos;s early years, Ken developed a reputation among critics for representing an archetypal &quot; boring man &quot;. This is an allegation denied by Roache, who has cited Ken&apos;s evolution over the years, his chaotic love life and dysfunctional family as evidence to the contrary. Roache has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards for his portrayal of Ken. Away from the canonical serial, Ken has been portrayed by James Roache (William Roache&apos;s son) in the dramatisation The Road to Coronation Street, and by Simon Chadwick in the play Corrie!. He has also been spoofed by impressionist Jon Culshaw. [ Storylines ] Ken is born and raised in Coronation Street, Weatherfield, Greater Manchester on 9 October 1939. He is the eldest son born to Frank (Frank Pemberton) and Ida Barlow ( Noel Dyson ). An intelligent pupil, Ken attends grammar school after passing his eleven plus exam and in 1957 wins a scholarship at Manchester University; he lives with his parents and brother David ( Alan Rothwell ) in Weatherfield while studying and gains a second class honours degree in History and English. Being educated and politically-minded, Ken differs from his family and neighbours. This is a source of friction between Ken and his father Frank, who believes Ken is trying to distance himself from his working-class roots. When Ken writes a scathing article about his uneducated neighbours in Weatherfield, Frank and the community are outraged. In 1961 Ken&apos;s mother dies in a motor accident, and he turns down a teaching post to support his father. Ken and Frank continue to clash until Frank&apos;s departure in 1964. David&apos;s death in 1968 and Frank&apos;s in 1971 leave Ken as the sole surviving Barlow. Ken begins teaching, and marries Valerie Tatlock ( Anne Reid ) in July 1962. Two years later, he has a fling with exotic dancer Pip Mistral (Elaine Stevens), but his marriage survives. Twins Peter (Robert Heanue) and Susan (Katie Heanneau) are born on 15 April 1965. In January 1966, Ken has another affair with reporter Jackie Marsh (Pamela Craig). Valerie leaves when she finds out, but is later persuaded to return. Ken continues to stand up for his political beliefs, and spends seven days in prison in March 1967, after being arrested for protesting. Ken is left a single-parent following Valerie&apos;s untimely death; she perishes after being electrocuted in January 1971, and Ken is left heartbroken. Ken is supported by Valerie&apos;s uncle Albert Tatlock ( Jack Howarth ), with whom he shares a close relationship, but caring for the twins proves too difficult and they are sent to live with their grandparents in Glasgow. Ken has numerous flings, including a one-night stand with Rita Littlewood ( Barbara Knox ), but his next serious relationship occurs in 1973, when Ken marries Janet Reid ( Judith Barker ), in the hope that she will mother his two children. Janet refuses to do this, and in 1974 they separate. Janet flits in and out of Ken&apos;s life until 1977, when she kills herself by taking an overdose when Ken turns down a reconciliation. When Ray Langton ( Neville Buswell ) leaves his wife Deirdre ( Anne Kirkbride ) in 1978, Ken supports her. In 1981 they marry, with Ken becoming stepfather to Deirdre&apos;s four-year-old daughter Tracy (Christabel Finch). However, by 1983, Deirdre grows bored with Ken and has an affair with his rival, Mike Baldwin ( Johnny Briggs ). Ken and Deirdre&apos;s marriage suffers; the couple separate in 1990, and eventually divorce following Ken&apos;s affair with Wendy Crozier (Roberta Kerr), his colleague at the local newspaper, The Weatherfield Recorder. Ken takes the separation badly and attempts suicide by overdose, but is stopped by his friend Bet Lynch ( Julie Goodyear ). Ken and Mike, who are the moral opposites of each other, remain enemies; Ken is incensed when his daughter, Susan, falls in love and has a short-lived marriage with Mike. In 1991 Ken and Mike compete for the same woman, Alma Sedgewick ( Amanda Barrie ). When she is dumped by Mike in favour of Jackie Ingram (Shirin Taylor), she starts seeing Ken. On Christmas Day 1991, Mike lures Alma back into his bed to get back at Ken. Later in 1992, Ken falls for one of his pupil&apos;s mothers  – Maggie Redman (Jill Kerman). The Baldwin/Barlow feud erupts again, as Mike is the father of Maggie&apos;s son, Mark (Christopher Oakswood). Mike hates the thought of Ken spending Christmas Day with his son, but Ken&apos;s pride gets the better of him. He cannot handle the situation, and he and Maggie split. Ken has a relationship with hairdresser Denise Osbourne ( Denise Black ) in 1994 and fathers her child; their son Daniel (Lewis Harney) is born in 1995. Denise agrees to marry Ken, but is having an affair with her brother-in-law Brian Dunkley ( Benny Young ) at the same time. She leaves Weatherfield in 1996, leaving Daniel with Ken. It is a short-lived custody as, later that year, Denise returns and snatches Daniel; Ken&apos;s attempts to reclaim his son fail. Ken and Deirdre remain close, despite their other relationships. They reunite in 1999, following encouragement from Deidre&apos;s mother Blanche ( Maggie Jones ). They eventually remarry on 8 April 2005; although Ken discovers that Deirdre slept with Dev Alahan ( Jimmi Harkishin ) in 2001, he forgives her and they remain together. Deirdre supports Ken in 2002 when he loses his teaching post for assaulting a pupil, Aidan Critchley (Dean Ashton), who has been terrorising him. Marital problems arise in 2006 when, following Mike&apos;s death from Alzheimer&apos;s, Ken grows jealous of Deirdre&apos;s grief reaction; he leaves home and tries to rebuild a relationship with his estranged son Daniel. Daniel&apos;s mother Denise, now single, gets the wrong idea and attempts to rekindle a romance with Ken; Ken rebuffs her advances and returns to Deirdre. Ken does stray in 2009, after meeting Martha Fraser ( Stephanie Beacham ). Ken falls in love with Martha, and in May 2009, plans to leave with her. He cannot go through with it, and he jilts her, returning to Deirdre. Eventually he admits to the infidelity. Although Deirdre is angry, she forgives him as he had forgiven her fling with Dev; however, Deirdre later cheats on Ken again, kissing Lewis Archer ( Nigel Havers ). Relations are once again strained between Ken and Deirdre. The couple acknowledge their mutual unhappiness with their marriage, but remain together. In late August 2010 Norris Cole ( Malcolm Hebden ) discovers an unopened letter addressed to Ken, dating back to the 1960s. The letter is written by Ken&apos;s first girlfriend, Susan Cunningham ( Patricia Shakesby ), whom Ken had dated in 1960. Susan has a son named Lawrence ( Linus Roache ), who turns out to be Ken&apos;s child. Ken and Lawrence bond, which temporarily threatens Ken&apos;s relationship with his other son Peter. When Ken discovers that Lawrence is intolerant of the homosexuality of his own son, James ( James Roache ), Ken severs contact. Realising that he has been unappreciative and neglectful of Peter over the years, he makes an effort to bond, supporting him through his relationship and health problems that follow. [ Creation and development ] [ Casting ] { Egan 2010, p.32. } Ken Barlow is one of the twenty-two original Coronation Street characters devised by series creator Tony Warren. He made his debut in the soap&apos;s first episode, broadcast on 9 December 1960. While auditionees for the other twenty-one original roles were drawn from casting director Margaret Morris&apos; contacts in the north of England, Warren spotted William Roache performing in the Granada Television play Marking Time, and knew that he was the right actor to play Ken. { Roache 2010, pp.42–43. } Roache almost declined the invitation to audition: &quot; I wasn&apos;t interested. I had my flat in London, I was getting acting parts and it all looked very rosy. &quot; [ http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/showbiz/994127/Coronation-Streets-Bill-Roache-50-years-as-Ken-Barlow.html What a Corrie on News of the World News International 26 September 2010 26 April 2011 http://www.webcitation.org/5yJafAbeP 29 April 2011 ] He changed his mind at the insistence of his agent, and attended the audition, at which he was asked to read The Daily Telegraph newspaper in a Lancashire accent. Roache believes that his indifference towards being cast had a positive impact on his audition, as it enabled him to relax. Two pilot episodes were filmed, with Ken played by Roache in one, and by actor Philip Lowrie in the other. { Roache 2010, p.40. } Lowrie was later cast in the role of another original character, Dennis Tanner.

[ http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/long-haul/article-2968739-detail/article.html In for the long haul Bath Chronicle Northcliffe Media 9 October 2010 26 April 2011 ] His agent convinced him to take it, as it would enhance his exposure around the broadcast of Marking Time. Coronation Street was a hit with viewers and its contract was extended. Roache was given a six-month contract in early 1961, followed by a one-year contract in June of that year, which he deemed amazing security at a time when he had been &quot; leading a hand-to-mouth existence &quot;. { Roache 2010, p.59. } The series became a long-running soap opera, airing multiple times weekly, and Roache continued in the role, though gradually ceased to affect a Lancashire accent. { Roache 2010, p.86. } Roache originally earned ₤10 per episode, compared to the ₤3,000 per episode that he earned in 2010. He stated in 2010 that although he initially only intended to feature in Coronation Street for a short time, once he had filmed it and it was transmitted with &quot; such colossal impact &quot;, he realised it was something special.

The soap was originally titled Florizel Street when it was commissioned. Roache reportedly could not pronounce Florizel, so the name of the street was changed to Coronation Street.

Roache has revealed that Ken&apos;s role in the serial was threatened in 1964, when producer Tim Aspinall, who was dubbed the &quot; mad axe-man &quot;, took the helm of Coronation Street. Aspinall culled a variety of characters from the serial, including fan favourite Martha Longhurst ( Lynne Carol ), and Ken was one of the characters he wished to axe: &quot; He had a kind of hit list of characters. He decided who he wanted out, while others including myself were put on warning that we were likely to be given the chop at a later date. It was appalling, &quot; recalls Roache. A potential storyline was devised in which Ken and his then wife Valerie would move to Australia. { Roache 2010, pp.76–77. } However, Ken was given a reprieve, as before he could be axed, Aspinall himself was sacked from his position. Spiritual enlightenment and a desire for self-improvement led Roache to consider quitting the series in the early 1970s, as he struggled with being in &quot; the most ego-driven profession there is &quot;. He ultimately decided to stay—a decision he is happy with in retrospect, as his qualms were never with the series itself, but the way he felt personally. { Roache 2010, pp.92–93. } In 2010 Roache pledged to stay with Coronation Street: &quot; I&apos;m not even thinking about retiring. It isn&apos;t an option and I don&apos;t want to even consider it [...] I love the Street and while they want me and while I can do it I want to carry on. I don&apos;t care if I&apos;m 120, I&apos;ll still be there. &quot; Roache said in 2010, &quot; When people ask me why I&apos;ve played the same role for 50 years I try to explain that I haven&apos;t because like all human beings, and thanks to clever script-writers, Ken&apos;s evolved. He’s been married three times, had 24 girlfriends and is head of a totally dysfunctional family. He has a son [Peter] who&apos;s an alcoholic bigamist and a daughter [Tracy] who&apos;s a convicted murderer. How many actors get the chance to perform scenes with meaty content like that? &quot; [ http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1345234_william_roache_me_ken_barlow_and_my_friend_emma William Roache: Me, Ken Barlow and my friend Emma Manchester Evening News Trinity Mirror 9 October 2010 29 April 2011 ] [ Characterisation ] [ 25% right #cccfff &quot; Ken has always been very earnest and honourable in his views, and he&apos;s tried to do the right thing. The trouble is that like any other human being he is flawed: we all are. When it came to the sort of job he would do, it was clear that teaching fitted perfectly with him as a person. Not only did it help satisfy him intellectually, it also allowed him to help others and at the same time give him a degree of control, which he probably always wanted. I always thought of him during that first decade as a young man who had a very stubborn streak in him when it came to his principles and what he thought was right. &quot; ] Tony Warren created Ken as a &quot; zeitgeist &quot; of modern times in 1960, and it has been suggested that Ken is a &quot; prism through which to read the political and cultural history of the last half century &quot;. [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/17/coronation-street-ken-barlow-bore In praise of Ken Barlow Joe Moran The Guardian ( Guardian News and Media ) 17 November 2010 29 April 2011 ] In the soap&apos;s early years, Ken was frequently presented as resenting what he saw as the anti-intellectual, repressed climate around him, and author Dorothy Hobson has suggested that Ken was ashamed of his working-class roots. { Hobson 2003, p.117. } Roache concurs that Ken obviously had higher aspirations than &quot; being stuck in Coronation Street &quot;, but notes that &quot; he was also portrayed as a nice young guy who was happy to help out if he could. &quot; { Roache 2010, p.54. } Roache considers himself &quot; the guardian of Ken &quot;, responsible for ensuring that his actions and dialogue remain true to the character. This responsibility lead to a two-year quarrel with his co-star Pat Phoenix, when she insisted that her character, Elsie Tanner, undermine Ken in an argument. Annoyed at Ken being belittled and the scene stripped of its &quot; dramatic impact &quot;, Roache rowed with Phoenix, who did not speak to him again—outside of their scenes together—for two years. { Roache 2010, pp.83–85. } An article in the Daily Mail in 2010 stated, &quot; in the beginning Ken was an angry young man who, as a student, was representative of the millions who had benefited from post-war reforms, such as free ­education for the gifted. &quot; The Guardian Joe Moran likened Ken to Richard Hoggart &apos;s scholarship boy &quot; the &apos;uprooted and anxious&apos; figure whose education had alienated him from his working-class origins. &quot; Moran suggested that Ken has led &quot; what Hoggart once called a &apos;carousel life&apos;, a life not of the upward trajectory of the professional career but of living from year to year and taking whatever job turns up. &quot; Moran added that Ken &quot; refused to go along with the last half century&apos;s stress on consumer aspiration and meritocratic elitism &quot;, but added that by modern standards, &quot; Ken has wasted his education and his life. He has played little part in &apos;wealth creation&apos; [...] and is still stuck in the same house he lived in when he was a student, leading his carousel life, stoically and decently. &quot; Ken&apos;s political stance is left - liberal. He has been described as the most famous fictional reader of The Guardian, a newspaper that attracts readers of the mainstream left of British political opinion. Ken has had several forays into journalism for left-wing publications over the years, and was occasionally shown to be frustrated that his political views were not shared by others. A scathing article he wrote for a newspaper in which he labelled his neighbours as &quot; lazy-minded, politically ignorant, starved of a real culture and prejudiced against any advance in human insight and scientific progress &quot; led to clashes with his father and a fistfight at the Rovers with Len Fairclough ( Peter Adamson ).

He changed from teacher to newspaper owner, through various jobs, but threw that away too. He has always liked to see himself as a big fish in a small pond, with his steely, domineering manner and feeling of superior intellect. &quot; Little suggested that Ken has transformed from an angry young man who never fitted in and was always challenging the system, into a bore next door, eventually discovering that he couldn&apos;t change the world after all. Little dubbed Ken Coronation Street&apos;s elder statesman and lynch-pin, a one-man Greek tragedy, and the greatest survivor in Weatherfield.

Chronicling the history of Coronation Street in 2007, Virgin Media stated, &quot; Perhaps unfairly dubbed boring, Ken is ultimately an intelligent man, frustrated by the cards life has dealt him  – although the hair, clothes and strong morals haven&apos;t helped. &quot; [ http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/soaps/coronation-street-history2.php Coronation Street: Who&apos;s Who? Virgin Media 25 January 2007 3 June 2009 ] Popular perception of Ken as being boring originated, in Roache&apos;s view, around the time of the Ken–Deirdre–Mike love triangle storyline. He refutes the label, particularly as Ken has had numerous romantic dalliances during his tenure. { Roache 2010, p.131. } Karen Price of the Western Mail called him the Street&apos;s resident intellectual, who has never quite managed to break free from his roots.

Discussing this, author Hobson has suggested that Ken&apos;s numerous relationships could give the impression that the character is a lothario or a great romantic; however, Hobson noted that this would be inaccurate as Ken is &quot; neither a great romantic nor someone with whom you would be wise to trust your romantic or emotional future. In fact, he is one of the characters about whom audiences would tend to want to warn any female characters to &apos;stay away, it&apos;ll end in tears&apos;. { Hobson 2003, p.129. } Roache feels that Ken&apos;s approach to romance early in his tenure belied his educated, intellectual affectations, and revealed him to be a typical &quot; northern working-class man at heart. &quot; He explained: &quot; [Ken] was the sort who wanted to have a wife who would stay at home, look after the kids and make sure the house was run smoothly, while he went off to work to pursue a career. It was very old-fashioned in many ways, but he could never see it that way and it was often left to the women he had relationships with to remind him of that trait in his character. &quot; Ken&apos;s many relationships have been marred by infidelities. Despite being generally &quot; well-meaning &quot;, Roache assessed that for the first two decades of Coronation Street, Ken had a ruthless streak where women were involved. While he has since mellowed somewhat, he was initially a &quot; sensitive, thinking chauvinist who liked the idea of having a wife who was always there for him, but at the same time [...] found nothing wrong with flirting or going off with another woman. &quot; { Roache 2010, pp.118–119. } ITV publicity noted how many relationships and flings he has had, stating &quot; This could take a while... Ken has had more girlfriends than most of the Street’s male residents put together. &quot; [ Ken Barlow http://entertainment.stv.tv/home/65702-ken-barlow/ STV ( STV Group plc ) 2 May 2011 17 December 2008 ] Between the periods of 1960 and 2007, Ken married four times and dated 27 women, including a character played by the then unknown actress Joanna Lumley, who played headmaster&apos;s daughter Elaine Perkins in 1973.

Roache and Reid had been to neighbouring schools, which gave them common ground and a relaxed attitude to working together. Ken&apos;s relationship with Valerie became popular with viewers. Roache once attributed their success to his own rapport with Reid, citing it as a helpful element in their on-screen chemistry. Ken and Valerie married on 4 August 1962. Executive producer H. V. Kershaw was aware of their popularity, and requested that Granada Television&apos;s evening duty officer be made available on the night of broadcast, in order to take phone calls of congratulations from viewers. Although no calls were made, 20  million viewers watched the wedding episode. Reid was &quot; thrilled &quot; with the reaction to the wedding. Roache was initially skeptical about the impact marriage would have on Ken&apos;s development. Roache said: &quot; I was a sort of young semi-heartthrob in those days and thought getting married was going to finish all that. &quot; { Little 1995, pp.40–41. } He felt that, given Ken&apos;s aspirations of upward social mobility and desire to leave Weatherfield, marriage conflicted with his characterisation, but realised it was necessary for the writers to anchor him in the area. { Roache 2010, p.94. } Valerie gave birth to twins, Peter and Susan, and became a housewife to look after them. All scenes involving the child actors were filmed separately from episodic shoots, to avoid unwanted noise ruining Roache and Reid&apos;s scenes. In one storyline, Ken had to start looking after the children more frequently, but he grew bored and would often leave them unattended. Valerie accused him of attempted murder on one occasion when a small house fire occurred  – with the twins trapped inside. { Little 1995, pp.57–58. } His boredom with his marriage caused him to have an affair with Jackie Marsh (Pamela Craig). There were only &quot; kissing scenes &quot; written into scripts, but the production team made it clear they were having a sexual relationship. The storyline &quot; horrified &quot; viewers, and Craig received abusive letters from angry fans. Craig knew nothing more than a short affair could occur between the pair. On-screen Elsie Tanner convinced him to end the affair; Valerie found out, but forgave him. { Little 1995, pp.63–64. } Roache enjoyed the aftermath, as it added a new dimension to Ken, whereby &quot; He was a married man with kids, and had all of those good intentions, but he was also liable to stray and clearly had trouble resisting the temptation of another woman. &quot; { Roache 2010, p.96. } Ken and Valerie&apos;s marriage came to an untimely end in 1971. Following Reid&apos;s decision to leave the role  – having grown bored of playing the character  – the producers opted to kill Valerie off.

She had plans for them to move away from the Street and into a bigger house, and went along with the idea Ken had of getting the twins back to live with them, while all along having no intention of sharing a home with his kids. it soon became clear that the marriage was not going to be a happy one, and Janet was no Val. &quot; ] Ken&apos;s second marriage in the serial was to a character named Janet Reid (Judith Barker) in 1973; their relationship was short-lived. There was no buildup to their marriage; Ken returned from Scotland and introduced Janet as his wife. [ Richardson Anne Corrie&apos;s Best Characters: No 2  – Ken Barlow http://www.aoltv.co.uk/2010/12/09/corries-best-characters-no-2-ken-barlow/ AOL 8 May 2011 9 December 2010 http://www.webcitation.org/5yXB1Ud0v 8 May 2011 ] The storyline&apos;s fast pace angered Roache; he once stressed: &quot; I was very cross about the whole thing. There was no wedding, she just arrived, no build-up to it. It was just like an idea that was shoved in. I wasn&apos;t happy. &quot; The storyline was unpopular with viewers, who did not approve of the wedding. Janet was already an unpopular character by then, because of her previous affairs with two other Coronation Street males. Barker said Janet was often perceived as treating Ken unfairly. She openly showed her dislike for his children and sent them to boarding school. The situation saw Ken realise he was in a &quot; loveless marriage &quot;  – a match made whilst feeling lonely and under the presumption that she was his last chance of happiness. The breakdown of their marriage was accompanied by what Little dubbed &quot; a series of spectacular rows &quot;, which saw Ken become violent towards Janet. { Little 1995, p.116. } One such row, which followed Ken&apos;s discovery of Janet&apos;s plans to send the twins to boarding school, was later used as an exercise in drama schools, which Roache deemed &quot; a nice compliment to everyone involved in creating the moment. &quot; { Roache 2010, p.109. } Janet and Ken split up in 1974. Barker was included in the series on and off for a few years, as Janet would occasionally return to be with Ken. In late 1976 Barker was asked to reprise the role for a final time. Janet returned on-screen in 1977 and asked Ken for another chance, claiming she had changed. When he rejects her, she commits suicide by taking an overdose. Barker recalled the &quot; exhausting &quot; scenes she and Roache filmed, and said there was substantial &quot; dramatic tracking &quot; scenes as Ken discovered her dead in bed. Ken was described as &quot; shattered &quot; and &quot; remorseful &quot; by the death of Janet, and felt guilty over the fact he did not try to help her more. To worsen his situation, he was initially suspected of murdering her. { Little 1995, pp.137–138. } [ Deirdre Hunt ] In 1972, Deirdre Hunt, played by Anne Kirkbride, was introduced into Coronation Street; the character would become synonymous with Ken&apos;s narrative when, in the early 1980s, Deirdre became Ken&apos;s third wife. A combined audience of 24 million viewers tuned in to see the nuptials.

In 2010 Roache said, &quot; [Ken] was beginning to look very ordinary and quite nerdy, and that in turn had a knock-on effect for me, because I started to lose confidence as an actor. I went through a time where I was really scared of &apos;drying&apos;, which is not being able to remember your lines. You start to wonder about your own ability to remember lines and act in the way you had, which can be very damaging. &quot; Roache inferred that the writers no longer knew how to utilise Ken. Although he had rarely done so in the past, he voiced his concerns to the series&apos; producer, dismayed that the character &quot; seemed to be floating in a nebulous state &quot;. He believes that Ken was thereafter included in &quot; much stronger stuff &quot; as a result, including a storyline in which Deirdre had an affair with his rival, Mike Baldwin (Briggs). { Roache 2010, p.20. } The storyline was devised in 1982. { Roache 2010, p.129. } Then producer Mervyn Watson recalls: &quot; It was normal story conference and we looked at the Ken/Deirdre marriage and had the idea of her having an affair with somebody in the Street. It was extremely passionately debated because there were categorical and opposite view points expressed. &quot; Watson believes that actors often feel &quot; disturbed and uncomfortable &quot; at the prospect of what their character will experience. In turn, he thought the scenario generated some of the best performances in the actors&apos; careers. He concluded that Roache proved his theory correct, and praised his performance. { Little 1995, p.165. } [ free rei gn ] { to vent my spleen  – so much so that even Anne Kirkbride didn&apos;t know how I was going to play the scene. All the anger and hurt Ken was feeling spilled out. &quot; } { Sharp 1996, p.15. } A now infamous scene, in which Ken comes face-to-face with Mike following the discovery of the affair and a showdown ensues, was originally scripted differently. Ken was intended to stand and meekly watch Mike and Deirdre chatting on his doorstep. Roache disliked this version, as he believed Ken&apos;s response lacked realism. Partly fuelled by his previous frustration with Ken&apos;s &quot; lame &quot; characterisation, Roache approached the episode&apos;s director, Brian Mills, and requested that Ken be allowed to hit Mike. Though the filming set-up planned for the scene did not allow for this, it was agreed that Ken would attempt to hit Mike, and that Deirdre would intervene. { Roache 2010, pp.22–24 } In the transmitted scene, Deirdre did intervene, resulting in Ken attempting to manhandle her. Roache recalls, &quot; Every time I looked at the words and at what was supposed to happen I knew it just didn&apos;t ring true. Poor Annie wasn&apos;t prepared for what happened to her next and actually burst into tears because of the ferocity of my performance. She was shaken up by it, and when it came to the moment for Mike Baldwin to knock at the door she got an even bigger shock. After Baldwin asked why Deirdre had put the phone down when he&apos;d called earlier, I slammed the door shut with my left hand and then slammed poor Annie against the door itself, leaving her shaken and shocked. She then made her way into the Barlows&apos; living room, sobbing her heart out, and Brian left the cameras rolling, capturing [Anne&apos;s] genuine distress. &quot; The storyline was described as the most volatile and explosive in the programme&apos;s history. Roache recalls viewers taking it very seriously, to the point that he received letters reading: &quot; Dear Ken, I though you should know that Mike Baldwin is seeing your wife! &quot; { Roache 2010, p.130 } He related that, &quot; When Deirdre decided to stop seeing Mike and stay with Ken, the scoreboard at Old Trafford on the night flashed the message that the couple were not splitting up to 56,000 football fans, amid thunderous cheers from the crowd! &quot; 20  million viewers tuned in for the episode; it attained the soap&apos;s second-highest recorded overnight ratings, surpassed only by the farewell episode of Hilda Ogden ( Jean Alexander ) in 1987.

The couple&apos;s first marriage eventually disintegrated in the early 1990s, this time when Ken had an affair with colleague Wendy Crozier, a dalliance which ended in divorce for the Barlows. Ken was kicked out of home on New Year&apos;s Day 1990. Their on/off relationship continued, with each having various other liaisons, until producers decided to reunite Ken and Deidre in 1999. Roache said, &quot; I was pleased. It seemed to fit perfectly with the lives that had been created for them throughout their time in Coronation Street. They had both gone off and done very silly things and had had affairs with people, and yet their overriding need as they got older was for each other. &quot; Ken and Deirdre&apos;s second marriage in 2005 was watched by an estimated 13 million viewers, compared to the nine million who watched the wedding of Prince Charles to Camilla Parker Bowles the following day.

Roache said, &quot; We have been together on screen for pretty much 30 years now and so much of what we do on camera is instinctive. We really are like an old married couple who have had their ups and downs, lived through them and come out the other side. &quot; [ http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a290831/bill-roache-praises-lovely-kirkbride.html Bill Roache praises &quot; lovely &quot; Kirkbride Ryan Love Digital Spy Hachette Filipacchi UK 1 December 2010 2 May 2011 ] [ Denise Osbourne ] Ken was paired romantically with hairdresser Denise Osbourne ( Denise Black ) in 1994, the romance scuppering the chances of a reconciliation between recent divorcees Ken and Deirdre. Scriptwriters had actually been planning to reunite Ken and Deirdre, but when Deirdre&apos;s actress fell ill and had to be written out, the scripts were changed and Ken was paired with Denise instead.

The Official Coronation Street Annual 1997 has described Ken and Denise as a &quot; mis-matched pair &quot; who were never destined to spend their lives together. In the storyline, Ken fathered Denise&apos;s son Daniel. They had an on/off relationship and a wedding was planned in 1996; however, in a plot twist, it was revealed to Ken that Denise, unable to &quot; hold her primitive lusts in check &quot;, was having an affair with her brother-in-law, Brian.

Denise Black has discussed her character&apos;s ambivalence towards her relationship with Ken, revealing why she believed Denise engaged in infidelity: &quot; The thing is that she&apos;s in love with both men. When she&apos;s with Brian she loves him. And she&apos;s completely in love with Ken when he&apos;s with her. So she has two loves and all the guilt that goes along with that scenario.

Denise&apos;s return storyline was scripted to coincide with Coronation Street s increase to four weekly episodes. It focused upon a custody battle for Daniel between Ken and Denise after Denise snatched Daniel. A source at the time discussed the storyline and Ken&apos;s reaction to losing his son: &quot; Ken is devastated when he returns home the week before Christmas and finds his son gone. He simply can&apos;t believe he&apos;s been snatched by the woman who dumped them. He immediately starts a custody battle. Denise plays heavily on the fact that she is the mother, while Ken [claims] that he is back in a relationship with his ex-wife Deirdre. Deirdre actually goes to court with him for support, but she gets angry when she finds out he tries to use their friendship as a lever to get Daniel back. &quot; [ http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEN%27S%2BIN%2BTROUBLE%2BAGAIN...IT%2BMUST%2BBE%2BCHRISTMAS.-a061159089 Ken&apos;s in trouble again...It must be Christmas Brian Roberts Sunday Mirror Trinity Mirror 29 September 1996 1 May 2011 ] When Denise was awarded custody, she left Coronation Street, and Ken lost contact with his son. Denise was reintroduced for several months in 2007, over a decade after she had last appeared. Ken tracked down his son following marital unease with Dierdre, which led to interactions with Denise when he turned up unannounced for a visit.

His later love interests included Wendy Crozier (Kerr), Alma Sedgewick (Barrie) and Maggie Redman (Kerman). [ Family ] Ken was disdainful of his parents, Frank (Pemberton) and Ida (Dyson). Their strained familial relationship was apparent from his very first scene, in which conflict arose over his reluctance to eat a meal with brown sauce. Roache called it &quot; good character-defining stuff &quot;, which established the antagonism between Ken and his father, borne from Ken&apos;s snobbery and desire to abandon his roots. { Roache 2010, p.53. } The death of his mother further illuminated the father-son relationship. Roache recalls that, &quot; although their relationship could often be stormy, with Ken&apos;s views and attitude rubbing Frank up the wrong way on a number of issues, the fact was that they had been thrown together by her death and they had to get used to living with each other without the buffer that Ida had often provided. &quot; { Roache 2010, pp.65–66. } While Dyson left the series under her own volition, Pemberton later became one of several cast members fired under Aspinall&apos;s tenure as producer.

Afterwards, further problems occurred and Ken was no longer able to cope.

Just the mention of Baldwin&apos;s name was enough to get Ken twitching with barely contained anger, and for Johnny Briggs and me it was absolutely wonderful. At best the two characters sometimes tolerated each other in an uneasy truce, but at worst the two of them not only threw insults at each other, but punches too. It was a relationship that ran for many years, and although towards the end of Mike Baldwin&apos;s time on the show you might say there was a little mellowing going on, it was never a relationship that was going to be anything other than uneasy. &quot; William Roache ] Of the love triangle storyline, Briggs has said, &quot; the way it captured the nation was amazing.

Scriptwriters capitalised on the rivalry between the characters when, in 1986, Mike married Ken&apos;s daughter Susan, a union that Ken strongly opposed. Numerous fights between Ken and Mike were featured, and Briggs has suggested that they became famous for their brawls. The first fight between the pair occurred in 1986, when Ken confronted Mike in his factory about Mike&apos;s maltreatment of his daughter. Of the confrontation, Briggs has said, &quot; It was a classic  – Baldwin getting it in his own territory, the factory. It took a lot to get Ken angry but after the way Mike had treated his daughter, he was furious. He marched into the office and let him have it. This was one of those rare times he caught Mike off-guard. &quot; Mike was shown to get revenge on Ken, though it took a further four years before he could do so on-screen. In a scene which aired in 1990, Mike punched Ken, knocking him over a table in the Rovers Return public house. Briggs has suggested that he and Roache became old hands at doing on-screen fistfights, and that both really enjoyed doing the stunts. According to Briggs, no choreographers were ever used. In 1998 one incident left Briggs with an injury after he fell backwards.

The episode was broadcast after the 9 pm watershed due to its depiction of violence. Ken and Mike were bound together by armed robbers, which facilitated an end to their feud; Ken helped Mike to combat a panic attack. The pair resolved to put the past behind them; it was a temporary reprieve. Mike had unknowingly fathered a son, Adam, during his brief marriage to Susan Barlow; she kept the baby a secret from him. Mike discovered Adam&apos;s existence in 2001; Susan attempted to flee, but was killed in a motor accident. Then followed a battle between Mike and Ken for custody of Adam, with Ken adamant that Mike should not look after his grandson. The storyline lead to the fifth fistfight between Ken and Mike in the soap&apos;s history, with the pair brawling at the funeral of Susan.

For most of Mike&apos;s life, it was his battles with Ken that kept him going. Like two cowboys, they spent their lives sizing each other up.
