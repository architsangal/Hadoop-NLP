The population was 1,145 at the 2000 census. [ History ] Ansonia was founded in 1845 under the name of &quot; Dallas. &quot; The village initially grew slowly; significant expansion only came after the coming of a railroad in 1852. { Wilson, Frazer. History of Darke County Ohio: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time. Vol. 1. } { Milford : Hobart, 1914. } [ 568 ] Because dense swamp s hindered settlement in the vicinity, [ 566 ] woodland was plentiful, and Ansonia became a center of manufacturing for hardwood products. [ 568 ] In 1873, the residents replaced their old school with a substantial two- story building at a cost of ten thousand dollars; this building was the first home of Ansonia High School, which was founded in that year. In turn, this building was demolished and a replacement erected in 1903. Another prominent structure in the village was a mausoleum; built of marble in 1911, it was the first mausoleum in Darke County. [ 569 ] In its early decades, Ansonia was heavily influenced by Freemasonry. The community&apos;s first lodge was chartered on October 21, 1874 with a membership of sixteen; in its first forty years, this lodge expanded nearly eightfold. An IOOF lodge was instituted on June 18, 1875 with sixteen members; it grew nearly sevenfold in its first forty years. Sixteen women in the community founded a chapter of the Daughters of Rebekah in 1894, and a lodge of the Knights of Pythias was also established in the village.
