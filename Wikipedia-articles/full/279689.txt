[ Demographics ] The National Statistical Coordination Board of the Philippines characterizes the municipality of Puerto Galera as 1st Class based on household income. { Municipality/City: PUERTO GALERA, National Statistics Coordination Board of the Philippines. } The population was 28,035 at the time of the 2007 Census of Population conducted by the National Statistics Office. { 2000 Census report for Oriental Mindoro - National Statistics Office } [ Barangays ] Puerto Galera is politically subdivided into 13 barangay s : Aninuán Balatero Dulangán Palangán Sabang San Antonio San Isidro Santo Niño Sinandigan Tabinay Villaflor Población Baclayán [ Environment ] In the summer of 1998 there was some extensive coral bleaching around Medio Island and a large section of shallow reef (&apos;Coral Gardens&apos;) died. Since then the coral has regrown with a larger diversity of coral species replacing the prolific table corals. Corals in Puerto galera were largely unaffected by the 2010 El Nino event. In 2006 two super-typhoons damaged the shallow areas around Escarceo Point. Many of the faster growing coral species were destroyed to a depth of 6m. This represented about 5% of the coral reef in the area. From mid-2008 there were extensive signs of new coral recruitment. Acropora species (staghorn and table coral) rapidly recolonated the area so that most of the damaged coral have been replaced with new growth. A study by the University of the Philippines in the 1980s, found that the Batangas, Puerto Galera area has one of the highest diversity of marine species in the world. It forms the centre of the golden triangle - The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia - renowned for their coral and fish species.

The area was designated a Man and Biosphere Reserve of UNESCO in 1973 and has some of the most diverse coral reef diving in Asia. The marine environment has benefited in recent years from the influx of tourist dollars. This has seen a huge reduction in the number of fishermen in the area, as they gain higher revenue from tourists.
