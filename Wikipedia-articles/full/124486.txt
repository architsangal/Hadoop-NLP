[ History ] Main Street in 1908 Originally known as Upper Gilmanton, Belmont was chartered in 1727 as a parish of Gilmanton. With water power from the Tioga River, it developed as a mill town. { History of the Belmont Mill (1833-2007) } Built in 1833, the Gilmanton Village Manufacturing Co. made cotton and woolen textiles. Over the years it would change owners, names and products. In 1921, it was the Belmont Hosiery Co., a maker of silk, lisle and woolen stockings. It went out of business in 1955, and the renovated mill building is now a community center. Separated from Gilmanton by an act of legislature, the town was incorporated in 1859 as Upper Gilmanton. The name Belmont was adopted in 1869 to honor August Belmont, a wealthy financier who (it was hoped) would contribute to the nascent town, but he never acknowledged the act. { New Hampshire Economic and Labor Market Information Bureau Profile } [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of [ 32.3 sqmi ], of which [ 30.5 sqmi ] is land and [ 1.9 sqmi ] is water, comprising 5.76% of the town.
