[ History and architecture ] An early settler in this part of DeKalb County was Chapman Powell, whose &quot; Medicine House &quot; cabin was built near 1218 Clairmont Road. (It has been preserved and relocated to Stone Mountain Park.) Dr. Powell (1798–1870) owned most of the land in the Candler Lake and South Fork Peachtree Creek area during his lifetime. His land was later purchased by Walter Candler. { Glen Creek Watershed History: &quot; Points of Interest in the Watershed &quot; } Major Washington Jackson Houston owned land on the north side of the South Fork of Peachtree Creek, in what is now the North Druid Hills CDP. Visitors used to visit Major Houston to buy ground cornmeal produced by his 1876 gristmill or to attend social gatherings held on his property. Major Houston converted the mill into an early hydroelectric plant circa 1900. Atlanta contractor Harry J. Carr bought Houston&apos;s land in the 1920s and constructed the fieldstone and wrought iron home now known as the Houston Mill House. Emory University purchased the home in the 1960s and renovated it. Houston Mill House, located at 849 Houston Mill Road, is now open for dining and special events. { http://www.houstonmillhouse.com/history.php } At the southeast corner of I-85 and North Druid Hills Road stands the former Executive Park Hotel, built in the 1960s. It was originally built with open two-story motel-style section and a five-story enclosed section. Later a tower was added and the complex included 2 nightclubs, a swimming pool and boutiques. During the 1990s, it served as a BellSouth training facility and temporary residences. { &quot; BellSouth training center &quot;, &apos;&apos;Flickr&apos;&apos; } [ Government and infrastructure ] The United States Postal Service operates the Druid Hills Post Office at 1799 Briarcliff Road NE in the CDP. { &quot; Post Office Location - DRUID HILLS. &quot; } { United States Postal Service.

The commercial component consists of two major shopping centers that are located at the intersection of LaVista and North Druid Hills roads that were developed in the 1950s. While it is generally accepted that the name &quot; Toco Hills &quot; is derived from the Toco Hill shopping center, the origin of that name is disputed. Some sources claim that the developer chose the name word Toco because it was the Brazilian Indian word for &quot; good luck. &quot; { http://neighborhoods.ajchomefinder.com/DeKalb/Toco%20Hills/30329?id=1 } Other sources claim Toco is an informal abbreviation of &quot; top of the County. &quot; { http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Briarcliff-Atlanta-GA.html } { http://www.atlantatimemachine.com/commercialbldgs/toco.htm } In any case, the shopping center was developed on what was a hill, and the name gradually changed to &quot; Toco Hills. &quot; The area is home to a large Jewish population, and marked by wooded subdivisions featuring mostly ranch homes surround the commercial area.
