[ Power point ] [ March 2012 ] [ 2010 6 15 ] { C++ } { Microsoft Windows } { Presentation program } { Proprietary } { commercial software } [ 2011 6 14 ] { Mac OS X } { Presentation program } { Proprietary } { commercial software } Microsoft PowerPoint is the name of a proprietary commercial software program developed by Microsoft. It was developed by Microsoft and officially launched on May 22, 1990. It is part of the Microsoft Office suite, and runs on Microsoft Windows and Apple &apos;s Mac OS X operating system. The current versions are Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2010 for Windows and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2011 for Mac. [ History ] Power Point 3.0 running on Windows 3.1 Originally designed for the Macintosh computer, the initial release was called &quot; Presenter &quot;, developed by Dennis Austin [ October 2011 ] and Thomas Rudkin [ October 2011 ] of Forethought, Inc. [ Gaskins Robert 1984-08-14 Sample Product Proposal: presentation graphics for overhead projection http://www.gbuwizards.com/files/gaskins-original-powerpoint-proposal-14-aug-1984.pdf 2009-08-19 ] In 1987, it was renamed to &quot; PowerPoint &quot; due to problems with trademarks, the idea for the name coming from Robert Gaskins. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8207849.stm The problem with PowerPoint Atkinson Max 19 August 2009 BBC News ] In August of the same year, Forethought was bought by Microsoft for $14 million USD ($ [ US 14000000 1987 ] in present-day terms [ US ] ), and became Microsoft&apos;s Graphics Business Unit, which continued to develop the software further. PowerPoint was officially launched on May 22, 1990, the same day that Microsoft released Windows 3.0. PowerPoint changed significantly with PowerPoint 97. Prior to PowerPoint 97, presentations were linear, always proceeding from one slide to the next. PowerPoint 97 incorporated the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language, underlying all macro generation in Office 97, which allowed users to invoke pre-defined transitions and effects in a non-linear movie-like style without having to learn programming PowerPoint 2000 (and the rest of the Office 2000 suite) introduced a clipboard that could hold multiple objects at once. Another change was that the Office Assistant was changed to be less intrusive. [ Swartz Luke 2003-06-12 http://xenon.stanford.edu/~lswartz/paperclip/ Why People Hate the Paperclip ] [ Microsoft Office 2000 ] [ Operation ] PowerPoint presentations consist of a number of individual pages or &quot; slides &quot;. The &quot; slide &quot; analogy is a reference to the slide projector. A better analogy would be the &quot; foils &quot; (or transparencies/plastic sheets) that are shown with an overhead projector, although they are in decline now.Slides may contain text, graphics, sound, movies, and other objects, which may be arranged freely. PowerPoint, howevere of a consistent style in a presentation using a template or &quot; Slide Master &quot;. The presentation can be printed, displayed live on a computer, or navigated through at the command of the presenter. For larger audiences the computer display is often projected using a video projector. Slides can also form the basis of webcasts. PowerPoint provides three types of movements: Entrance, emphasis, and exit of elements on a slide itself are controlled by what PowerPoint calls Custom Animations. Transitions, on the other hand, are movements between slides. These can be animated in a variety of ways. Custom animation can be used to create small story boards by animating pictures to enter, exit or move. [ Cultural impact ] A PowerPoint Presentation in Progress. Supporters say that [ http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/powerpoint.htm PowerPoint Presentations: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Shkaminski ] [ http://www.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk/journal/vol2/beej-2-3.htm The use and abuse of PowerPoint in Teaching and Learning in the Life Sciences: A Personal Overview Jones Allan 2003-08-18 2009-02-10 Bioscience Education ] [ http://technologysource.org/article/use_of_powerpoint_in_teaching_comparative_politics/ Technology Source The Use of PowerPoint in Teaching Comparative Politics ] the ease of use of presentation software can save a lot of time for people who otherwise would have used other types of visual aid—hand-drawn or mechanically typeset slides, blackboards or whiteboards, or overhead projections. Ease of use also encourages those who otherwise would not have used visual aids, or would not have given a presentation at all, to make presentations. As PowerPoint&apos;s style, animation, and multimedia abilities have become more sophisticated, and as the application has generally made it easier to produce presentations (even to the point of having an &quot; AutoContent Wizard &quot; (discontinued in PowerPoint 2007) suggesting a structure for a presentation), the difference in needs and desires of presenters and audiences has become more noticeable. The benefit of PowerPoint is continually debated, though most people believe that the benefit may be to present structural presentations to business workers, such as Raytheon Elcan does.

Wired Issue 11.09 ] Its use in classroom lectures has influenced investigations of PowerPoint’s effects on student performance in comparison to lectures based on overhead projectors, traditional lectures, and online lectures. Not only is it a useful tool for introductory lectures, but it also has many functions that allow for review games, especially in the younger grades. There are no compelling results to prove or disprove that PowerPoint is more effective for learner retention than traditional presentation methods. [ http://www.citeulike.org/user/yoel/article/3987866 Information retention from PowerPoint; and traditional lectures April Savoy 2009-01-30 2009-03-05 Computers &amp; Education ] The effect on audiences of poor PowerPoint presentations has been described as PowerPoint hell. [ Criticism ] Although PowerPoint has the aforementioned benefits, some argue that PowerPoint has negatively affected society. The terms &quot; Death by PowerPoint &quot; and &quot; PowerPoint Hell &quot; refer to the poor use of the software. Many large companies and branches of the government use PowerPoint as a way to brief employees on important issues that they must make decisions about. Opponents of PowerPoint argue that reducing complex issues to bulleted points is detrimental to the decision making process; in other words, because the amount of information in a presentation must be condensed, viewing a PowerPoint presentation does not give one enough detailed information to make a truly informed decision. A frequently cited example is Edward Tufte &apos;s analysis of PowerPoint slides prepared for briefing NASA officials concerning possible damage to the Space Shuttle Columbia during its final launch. [ Tufte Edward http://www.edwardetufte.com PowerPoint Does Rocket Science--and Better Techniques for Technical Reports 09/06/2005 http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id%3D0001yB%26amp%3Btopic_id%3D1 04/27/2010 ] Tufte argues that the slides, prepared by the Boeing Corporation, had the effect of oversimplifying the situation, and provided false assurance that the ultimately fatal damage to the shuttle was only minimal. Tufte argued: The most critical information was consigned to the lowest level of importance in the outline style. The low resolution of the slides encouraged the use of acronyms and undescriptive pronouns instead of specific, descriptive terms and language. PowerPoint&apos;s limited font styling obscured proper notation of key scientific measurements. Tufte concluded that: The language, spirit, and presentation tool of the pitch culture had penetrated throughout the NASA organization, even into the most serious technical analysis, the survival of the shuttle. A review of Tufte&apos;s book, The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint can be read online. { Lowenthal, P. R., &amp; White, J. W. (2008, January). Review of the book The cognitive style of PowerPoint: Pitching out corrupts within. Education Review. } Similar criticisms appeared in the Report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board ( &quot; Engineering by Viewgraphs &quot; v.1, p.191). { Report (August 2003) } [ &quot; Death by PowerPoint &quot; ] “Death by PowerPoint” is a criticism of slide-based presentations referring to a state of boredom and fatigue induced by information overload during presentations such as those created by the Microsoft application PowerPoint. The phrase was first coined by Angela R. Garber. [ http://www.smallbusinesscomputing.com/biztools/article.php/684871 Death By Powerpoint Small Business Computing.com April 2001 ] Further criticisms of the cognitive effects of PowerPoint have been expounded by others, for example, Edward Tufte (2006) { Tufte E.R. (2006), The cognitive style of PowerPoint: Pitching out corrupts within (2nd Ed,) Graphics Press: Cheshire, CT. } and Kalyuga et al. (1991). { Kalyuga, P., Chandeler, P. and Sweller, J. (1991), When redundant on-screen text in multi media technical instruction can interfere with learning. Human Factors. 46(3):567–581. } Wright (2009) suggests PowerPoint is a convenient prop for poor speakers, it can reduce complicated messages to simple bullet points and it elevates style over substance; and that these three things contribute to its popularity. { Wright, J. (2009) A matter of presentation. Nursing Management 16(4):30–34. } It can also be called “PowerPoint Poisoning”—a term originated by Scott Adams of Dilbert fame. The Anti PowerPoint Party (founded in May 2011) is a Swiss political party dedicated to decrease professional use of PowerPoint and other presentation software, which the party claims &quot; causes national-economic damage amounting to 2.1 billion CHF &quot; and lowers the quality of a presentation in &quot; 95% of the cases &quot;. The party advocates flip charts as an alternative to presentation software. [ Boredom ] “PowerPoint hell” is the tedium some people report on sitting through PowerPoint visual presentations that are too long and complex, making excessive use of the software’s features and when the presenter just reads from the slides.

In September 2010, Colonel Lawrence Sellin was fired from his post at the ISAF for publishing a piece critical of the over-dependence of military staffs on the presentation method and bloated bureaucracy.

Office PowerPoint Viewer is added by default to the same disk or network location that contains one or more presentations packaged by using the Package for CD feature. PowerPoint Viewer is installed by default with a Microsoft Office 2003 installation for use with the Package for CD feature. The PowerPoint Viewer file is also available for download from the Microsoft Office Online Web site. Presentations password-protected for opening or modifying can be opened by PowerPoint Viewer. The Package for CD feature allows packaging any password-protected file or setting a new password for all packaged presentations. PowerPoint Viewer prompts for a password if the file is open password-protected. PowerPoint Viewer supports opening presentations created using PowerPoint 97 and later. In addition, it supports all file content except OLE objects and scripting. PowerPoint Viewer is currently only available for computers running on Microsoft Windows.

Screen Capturing allows for taking a screen capture and adding it into the document. It is now possible to remove background images, and there are additional special effects that can be used with pictures, such as &apos;Pencil effects&apos;. Additional transitions are also available. However, the ability to apply certain text effects directly onto existing text, as seen in Microsoft Word is not available; a separate WordArt text box is still required.
