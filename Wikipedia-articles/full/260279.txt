The town was first settled in 1768 by James Sanderson and his family. { Hayward&apos;s &apos;&apos;New England Gazetteer of 1839&apos;&apos; } In 1776, Major Joab Hoisington built a gristmill, followed by a sawmill, on the south branch of the Ottauquechee River. { A. J. Coolidge &amp; J. B. Mansfield, &apos;&apos;A History and Description of New England&apos;&apos;; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 } Although the Revolution slowed settlement, Woodstock developed rapidly once the war ended in 1783. The Vermont General Assembly met here in 1807 before moving the next year to the new capital at Montpelier. Waterfalls in the Ottauquechee River provided water power to operate mills. Factories made scythes and axes, carding machines, and woolens. There was a machine shop and gunsmith shop. Manufacturers also produced furniture, wooden wares, window sashes and blinds.
