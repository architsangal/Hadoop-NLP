Russell Wakefield, } { Elizabeth Louisa Moresby, } { Evangeline Walton, } { Ramsey Campbell } Algernon Henry Blackwood, CBE (14 March 1869 – 10 December 1951) was an English short story writer and novelist, one of the most prolific writers of ghost stories in the history of the genre. He was also a journalist and a broadcasting narrator. S. T. Joshi has stated that &quot; his work is more consistently meritorious than any weird writer&apos;s except Dunsany &apos;s &quot; { S. T. Joshi, The Weird Tale (University of Texas Press, 1990), p.132. } and that his short story collection Incredible Adventures (1914) &quot; may be the premier weird collection of this or any other century &quot;. { S. T. Joshi, The Weird Tale (University of Texas Press, 1990), p.131. } [ Life and work ] Blackwood was born in Shooter&apos;s Hill (today part of south-east London, but then part of northwest Kent ) and educated at Wellington College. His father was a Post Office administrator who, according to Peter Penzoldt, &quot; though not devoid of genuine good-heartedness, had appallingly narrow religious ideas &quot;. { Peter Penzoldt, The Supernatural in Fiction (1952), Part II, Chapter 7. } Blackwood had a varied career, working as a milk farmer in Canada, operating a hotel, as a newspaper reporter in New York City, bartender, model, journalist for the New York Times, private secretary, businessman, and violin teacher. { Jack Sullivan, ed. The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural (1986), p. 38 } Throughout his adult life, he was an occasional essayist for various periodicals. In his late thirties, he moved back to England and started to write stories of the supernatural. He was very successful, writing at least ten original collections of short stories and eventually appearing on both radio and television to tell them. He also wrote fourteen novels, several children&apos;s books, and a number of plays, most of which were produced but not published. He was an avid lover of nature and the outdoors, and many of his stories reflect this. To satisfy his interest in the supernatural, he joined the Ghost Club. He never married; according to his friends he was a loner but also cheerful company. { Jack Sullivan, ed. The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural (1986), p. 39 } Jack Sullivan points out that &quot; Blackwood&apos;s life parallels his work more neatly than perhaps that of any other ghost story writer. Like his lonely but fundamentally optimistic protagonists, he was a combination of mystic and outdoorsman; when he wasn&apos;t steeping himself in occultism, including Rosicrucianism and Buddhism, he was likely to be skiing or mountain climbing. &quot; His two best known stories are probably &quot; The Willows &quot; and &quot; The Wendigo &quot;. He would also often write stories for newspapers at short notice, with the result that he was unsure exactly how many short stories he had written and there is no sure total. Though Blackwood wrote a number of horror stories, his most typical work seeks less to frighten than to induce a sense of awe. Good examples are the novels The Centaur, which climaxes with a traveller&apos;s sight of a herd of the mythical creatures; and Julius LeVallon and its sequel The Bright Messenger, which deal with reincarnation and the possibility of a new, mystical evolution in human consciousness. In correspondence with Peter Penzoldt, Blackwood wrote { Quoted in Peter Penzoldt, The Supernatural in Fiction (1952), Part II, Chapter 7. } My fundamental interest, I suppose, is signs and proofs of other powers that lie hidden in us all; the extension, in other words, of human faculty. So many of my stories, therefore, deal with extension of consciousness; speculative and imaginative treatment of possibilities outside our normal range of consciousness.... Also, all that happens in our universe is natural; under Law; but an extension of our so limited normal consciousness can reveal new, extra-ordinary powers etc., and the word &quot; supernatural &quot; seems the best word for treating these in fiction. I believe it possible for our consciousness to change and grow, and that with this change we may become aware of a new universe. A &quot; change &quot; in consciousness, in its type, I mean, is something more than a mere extension of what we already possess and know. Blackwood was a member of one of the factions of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as was his contemporary Arthur Machen. { http://www.shadowplayzine.com/Articles/hermetic_horrors.htm } Qabalistic themes are at the heart of his novel The Human Chord.

Blackwood died after several strokes. Officially his death on 10 December 1951 was of cerebral thrombosis with arteriosclerosis as contributory. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. A few weeks later his nephew took his ashes to Saanenmoser and scattered them over the mountains that he had loved for over forty years.

Lovecraft included Blackwood as one of the &quot; Modern Masters &quot; in the section of that name in &quot; Supernatural Horror in Literature &quot;. Peter Penzoldt devotes the final chapter of The Supernatural in Fiction (1952) to an analysis of Blackwood&apos;s work, and the book is dedicated &quot; with deep admiration and gratitude, to Algernon Blackwood, the greatest of them all &quot;. There is an extensive critical analysis of Blackwood&apos;s work in Jack Sullivan &apos;s book Elegant Nightmares: The English Ghost Story From Le Fanu to Blackwood (1978). There is a critical essay on Blackwood&apos;s work in S. T. Joshi &apos;s The Weird Tale (1990). The plot of Caitlin R. Kiernan &apos;s novel Threshold (2001) draws upon Blackwood&apos;s &quot; The Willows &quot;, which is quoted several times in the book. Kiernan has cited Blackwood as an important influence on her writing. In The Books in My Life, Henry Miller chose Blackwood&apos;s The Bright Messenger as &quot; the most extraordinary novel on psychoanalysis, one that dwarfs the subject. &quot; Algernon Blackwood appears as a character in the novel The Curse of the Wendigo by Rick Yancey [ Works ] [ Novels ] In sequence of first publication : Jimbo: A Fantasy (1909a) The Education of Uncle Paul (1909b) The Human Chord (1910) The Centaur (1911) A Prisoner in Fairyland (1913); sequel to The Education of Uncle Paul The Extra Day (1915) Julius LeVallon (1916a) The Wave (1916b) The Promise of Air (1918a) The Garden of Survival (1918b) The Bright Messenger (1921); sequel to Julius LeVallon Dudley &amp; Gilderoy: A Nonsense (1929) Children&apos;s novels: Sambo and Snitch (1927) The Fruit Stoners: Being the Adventures of Maria Among the Fruit Stoners (1934) [ Plays ] In sequence of first performance: The Starlight Express (1915), coauthored with Violet Pearn; incidental music by Edward Elgar; based on Blackwood&apos;s 1913 novel A Prisoner in Fairyland The Crossing (1920a), coauthored with Bertram Forsyth; based on Blackwood&apos;s 1913 short story &quot; Transition &quot; Through the Crack (1920b), coauthored with Violet Pearn; based on Blackwood&apos;s 1909 novel The Education of Uncle Paul and 1915 novel The Extra Day White Magic (1921a), coauthored with Bertram Forsyth The Halfway House (1921b), coauthored with Elaine Ainley Max Hensig (1929), coauthored with Frederick Kinsey Peile; based on Blackwood&apos;s 1907 short story &quot; Max Hensig — Bacteriologist and Murderer &quot; [ Short fiction collections ] In sequence of first publication: The Empty House and Other Ghost Stories (1906); original collection The Listener and Other Stories (1907); original collection John Silence (1908); original collection; reprint ed with added preface, 1942 The Lost Valley and Other Stories (1910); original collection Pan&apos;s Garden: a Volume of Nature Stories (1912); original collection Ten Minute Stories (1914a); original collection Incredible Adventures (1914b); original collection Day and Night Stories (1917); original collection Wolves of God, and Other Fey Stories (1921), honorarily coauthored with Wilfred Wilson; original collection Tongues of Fire and Other Sketches (1924); original collection Ancient Sorceries and Other Tales (1927a); selections from previous Blackwood collections, and pre-publication abridgment of 1932&apos;s planned The Willows and Other Queer Tales The Dance of Death and Other Tales (1927b); selections from previous Blackwood collections; reprinted as 1963&apos;s The Dance of Death and Other Stories Strange Stories (1929); selections from previous Blackwood collections Short Stories of To-Day &amp; Yesterday (1930); selections from previous Blackwood collections The Willows and Other Queer Tales (1932); selected by G.
