The meaning of the first element is uncertain (maybe merr which means &quot; mare &quot; or mýrr which means &quot; bog &quot; or &quot; marsh &quot; ) and the last element is akr which means &quot; field &quot; or &quot; acre &quot;.

Traditionally, mining has played a major role in the area and has been of great economic importance for Meråker. Thus a silver mining cart on a red background as a symbol for the municipality was an obvious decision. The cart depicted in the arms, however, is officially described as a cart, not a mining cart.
