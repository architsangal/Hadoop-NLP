It was nominated for the National Book Award, was a best-seller, and is one of DeLillo&apos;s better-known novels. In 2006, a survey of eminent authors and critics conducted by The New York Times found Underworld the runner-up for the best work of American fiction of the past 25 years; it garnered 11 of 125 votes, finishing behind only Toni Morrison &apos;s Beloved with 15 votes. { In Search of the Best - New York Times } [ Plot introduction ] Underworld is a non-linear narrative that has many intertwined themes. A central character is Nick Shay, a waste management executive, who leads an undirected existence in late 20th century America. His wife, Marian, is having an affair with one of his friends. The events of the novel span from the 1950s through the 1990s. The characters in the book respond to several historical events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis and nuclear proliferation. The novel is divided into eight sections: Prologue – The Triumph of Death (3 October 1951; this section has been published separately, as a novella, under the title Pafko at the Wall ) Part 1 – Long Tall Sally (Spring-Summer 1992) Part 2 – Elegy for Left Hand Alone (Mid-1980s – Early 1990s) Part 3 – The Cloud of Unknowing (Spring 1978) Part 4 – Cocksucker Blues (Summer 1974) Part 5 – Better Things for Better Living Through Chemistry (Selected Fragments Public and Private in the 1950s and 1960s) Part 6 – Arrangement in Gray and Black (Fall 1951 – Summer 1952) Epilogue – Das Kapital [ Explanation of the novel&apos;s title ] DeLillo said that the novel’s title came to him as he thought about radioactive waste buried deep underground and about Pluto, god of death. { Bing, Jonathan. The Ascendance of Don DeLillo, } { Publishers Weekly, August 11, 1997. (retrieved Sept. 7, 2007) } The waste and byproducts of history, dissected and discussed throughout the novel, constantly resurface from the underworld (or, subconscious) of the American population despite their best attempts to repress and bury things they would rather forget. Further connections and connotations about the title can be made between part of the novel&apos;s subject matter (mafia criminals in New York who Nick Shay fantasises may have had his father killed), and the 1927 gangster film of the same name. [ Plot summary ] The novel opens on October 3, 1951, when a boy named Cotter Martin sneaks in to watch the New York Giants play the Brooklyn Dodgers at the Giants&apos; home field Polo Grounds. { &quot; Reticent Novelist Talks Baseball, Not Books &quot; by David Firestone, The New York Times, September 10, 1998. Retrieved 2010-06-01. } (The prologue, Pafko at the Wall, was written on its own before the novel.) In the ninth inning, Ralph Branca pitches to Bobby Thomson, who hits the ball into the stands for a three-run homer, beating the Dodgers 5-4 and capturing the National League pennant. Known to baseball fans as &quot; The Shot Heard &apos;Round the World &quot;, the fate of that ball is unknown, but in DeLillo&apos;s novel, Cotter Martin wrests this valuable ball away from another fan who has just befriended him and runs home. Cotter&apos;s father, Manx, steals the ball and later sells it for thirty-two dollars and forty-five cents. Branca and Thomson are never given much screen time, and Jackie Gleason and Frank Sinatra only put in cameos, but other historical figures become important parts of the story. J. Edgar Hoover muses on death, loyalty and leather masks while comedian Lenny Bruce faces the Cuban Missile Crisis by impersonating a hysterical housewife shrieking, &quot; We&apos;re all gonna die! &quot; Early in the novel it is revealed that Nick Shay was in a juvenile detention center for murdering a man, but it is not until near the end of the book that we learn the details of his crime. After being released from the detention center, he is sent to a Jesuit reform school in northern Minnesota. In the epilogue, we learn that Nick and Marian remain married despite infidelity on both sides. In fact, Nick indicates their relationship is much improved as he has opened up to her about his past – a subject that had always much-interested her and that he had been unwilling to discuss. [ Characters in Underworld ] Nick Shay – The novel’s protagonist and a waste management executive. He spends much of his life trying to come to terms with his father’s disappearance. Marian Shay – Nick’s wife. Rosemary – Nick’s mother. Jimmy – Nick’s father who disappeared when Nick was 11. He and his family lived near Arthur Avenue, Bronx. On page 234, an old, infirm character easily walks from Jimmy&apos;s neighborhood to Arthur Avenue. Jimmy was a small-time bookie who had a reputation for never writing anything down. He went out for a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes and never returned. Matty – Nick’s little brother. Very skilled at chess in his youth, but then gave it up. He served in the military in Vietnam and then worked for the U.S. government in the development of nuclear weapons. However, he soon finds he is uncomfortable with his choice of career and leaves to join a think tank. Klara Sax – An aspiring artist who has a brief affair with Nick when he is 17 years old and she is in her 30s and married to Albert Bronzini with a young daughter. She and Albert divorce some time later (this is her first marriage). In all, she married three times, but divorced all three men.

George the Waiter - A middle-aged heroin-addict, a childhood friend of Nick&apos;s.

[ Literary significance and reception ] The response from critics was very positive with David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle declaring Underworld DeLillo&apos;s “best novel and perhaps that most elusive of creatures, a great American novel. &quot; { Wiegand, David. We Are What We Waste, San Francisco Chronicle, 21 September 1997 } The novel has been called ambitious and highly powerful. { Marshall, Gary. Don DeLillo: Underworld, Spike Magazine, December 1998 } Several critics did note that it was overly long and could have benefited from some additional editing. { Amis, Martin. Survivors of the Cold War, The New York Times, October 5, 1997 } On Salon.com, Laura Miller wrote that “Nick&apos;s secret, the one that supposedly provides the book&apos;s suspense, proves anticlimactic. &quot; { Miller, Laura. one nation, undercover, Salon.com, 26 September 1997. } In May 2006, The New York Times Book Review named Underworld as a runner up for the best work of American fiction of the previous 25 years. { &quot; What is the best work of American fiction of the last 25 years? &quot; } { The New York Times, May 21, 2006. } The well-known literary critic Harold Bloom, although also expressing reservations about the book&apos;s length, has said Underworld is &quot; the culmination of what [DeLillo] can do &quot; and one of the few contemporary American works of fiction that &quot; touched what I would call the sublime, &quot; along with works by Cormac McCarthy, Philip Roth, and Thomas Pynchon. { &quot; } { Harold Bloom on Blood Meridian &quot; } [ Allusions and references ] [ Allusions to other works ] The novel has J. Edgar Hoover utterly intrigued by The Triumph of Death, a painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Hoover first sees the painting while at the baseball game; the painting was reproduced in Life and pieces of it fall on him when someone in the stands above tears up the magazine and tosses the pieces. Later in the book he obtains a print of the painting. Several segments of the novel are named in homage to other works. Das Kapital is Karl Marx &apos;s magnum opus, &quot; Long Tall Sally &quot; is a song by Little Richard also famous as a cover by The Beatles, and &quot; Cocksucker Blues &quot; is an infamous unreleased Rolling Stones song and film. &quot; Better Things for Better Living Through Chemistry &quot; was an advertising slogan for DuPont. [ Allusions to actual history, geography and current science ] The novel incorporates a number of historical events. The prologue is about &quot; The Shot Heard &apos;Round the World &quot; and the whereabouts of the ball hit by Thomson are a recurrent element of the book. The book also employs Lenny Bruce ’s reaction to the Cuban Missile Crisis and Soviet Union&apos;s atomic weapons program (including their testing grounds in Kazakhstan ). DeLillo has said that the front page of The New York Times on October 4, 1951, inspired Underworld. { Interview with Don DeLillo by } { Terry Gross of } { Fresh Air, October 12, 1997. } { The front page of &apos;&apos;The New York Times&apos;&apos; on October 4, 1951 } [ Awards and nominations ] In 1997, Underworld was a finalist for the National Book Award. { National Book Award winners and finalists (retrieved September 7, 2007) } Underworld was a nominated finalist for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize. { 1998 Pulitzer Prize winner and finalists } In addition, Underworld was the winner of the 2000 William Dean Howells Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.
