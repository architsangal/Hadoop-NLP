Pitchfork said &quot; at every turn Marry Me takes the more challenging route of twisting already twisted structures and unusual instrumentation to make them sound perfectly natural and, most importantly, easy to listen to as she overdubs her thrillingly sui generis vision into vibrant life. &quot; The songs featured on Marry Me were largely written when Clark was eighteen and nineteen years old, and, according to Clark, &quot; represented a more idealized version of what life was or what love was or anything in the eyes of someone who hadn&apos;t really experienced anything. &quot; The album featured its one single, &quot; Paris Is Burning &quot;, as well as a music video for &quot; Jesus Saves, I Spend &quot;.
