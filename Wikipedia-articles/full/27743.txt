Solar energy technologies include solar heating, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal electricity and solar architecture, which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces. Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that &quot; the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared &quot;.

The Earth receives 174   petawatts (PW) of incoming solar radiation ( insolation ) at the upper atmosphere. { Smil (1991), p. 240 } Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth&apos;s surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. [ Natural Forcing of the Climate System Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/041.htm#121 2007-09-29 ] Earth&apos;s land surface, ocean s and atmosphere absorb solar radiation, and this raises their temperature. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth&apos;s surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclone s and anti-cyclone s.

However, all renewable energies, other than geothermal and tidal, derive their energy from the sun. Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight. Active solar techniques use photovoltaic panels, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.

When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates&apos; Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. { Balcomb(1992) } Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance. Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures are a result of increased absorption of the Solar light by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower albedo s and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and plant trees. Using these methods, a hypothetical &quot; cool communities &quot; program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3  °C at an estimated cost of US$1  billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US$530  million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings.

During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. { Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 42–46 } Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. { Bénard (1981), p. 347 } { Leon (2006), p. 62 } More recently the technology has been embraced by vinters, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.

Daylighting systems collect and distribute sunlight to provide interior illumination. This passive technology directly offsets energy use by replacing artificial lighting, and indirectly offsets non-solar energy use by reducing the need for air-conditioning. { Tzempelikos (2007), p. 369 } Although difficult to quantify, the use of natural lighting also offers physiological and psychological benefits compared to artificial lighting. Daylighting design implies careful selection of window types, sizes and orientation; exterior shading devices may be considered as well. Individual features include sawtooth roofs, clerestory windows, light shelves, skylights and light tube s. They may be incorporated into existing structures, but are most effective when integrated into a solar design package that accounts for factors such as glare, heat flux and time-of-use. When daylighting features are properly implemented they can reduce lighting-related energy requirements by 25%. [ Apte, J. et al.

Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment. { Mazria(1979), p. 29–35 } A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building.

Commercial CSP plants were first developed in the 1980s, and the 354 MW SEGS CSP installation is the largest solar power plant in the world and is located in the Mojave Desert of California. Other large CSP plants include the Solnova Solar Power Station (150 MW) and the Andasol solar power station (100 MW), both in Spain.

[ http://books.google.com/books?id%3D9CcDAAAAMBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA41%26amp%3Bdq%3DPopular%2BScience%2B1931%2Bplane#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3DPopular%20Science%201931%20plane%26amp%3Bf%3Dtrue &quot; Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power &quot;, June 1931, Popular Science 2011-04-19 ] Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. { Perlin (1999), p. 18–20 } Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. { Perlin (1999), p. 29 } These early solar cells cost 286  USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. { Perlin (1999), p. 29–30, 38 } [ Solar chemical ] [ Solar chemical ] Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical. { Bolton (1977), p. 1 } A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. { Wasielewski MR. Photoinduced electron transfer in supramolecular systems for artificial photosynthesis. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 435-461. } The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol ) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. { Hammarstrom L and Hammes-Schiffer S. Artificial Photosynthesis and Solar Fuels. Accounts of Chemical Research 2009; 42 (12): 1859-1860. } Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050- the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. { Gray HB. Powering the planet with solar fuel. Nature Chemistry 2009; 1: 7. } Hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2300-2600  °C). { Agrafiotis (2005), p. 409 } Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. { Zedtwitz (2006), p. 1333 } Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute uses a 1  MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1200  °C. This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen. [ Solar Energy Project at the Weizmann Institute Promises to Advance the use of Hydrogen Fuel Weizmann Institute of Science http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/site/en/weizman.asp?pi%3D371%26amp%3Bdoc_id%3D4210 2008-06-25 ] Sandia&apos;s Sunshine to Petrol (S2P) technology uses the high temperatures generated by concentrating sunlight along with a zirconia / ferrite catalyst to break down atmospheric carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide (CO). The carbon monoxide can then be used to synthesize conventional fuels such as methanol, gasoline and jet fuel. [ Sandia’s Sunshine to Petrol project seeks fuel from thin air Sandia Corporation http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2007/sunshine.html 2008-05-02 ] A photogalvanic device is a type of battery in which the cell solution (or equivalent) forms energy-rich chemical intermediates when illuminated. These energy-rich intermediates can potentially be stored and subsequently reacted at the electrodes to produce an electric potential. The ferric-thionine chemical cell is an example of this technology. { Bolton (1977), p. 16, 119 } Photoelectrochemical cells or PECs consist of a semiconductor, typically titanium dioxide or related titanates, immersed in an electrolyte. When the semiconductor is illuminated an electrical potential develops. There are two types of photoelectrochemical cells: photoelectric cells that convert light into electricity and photochemical cells that use light to drive chemical reactions such as electrolysis. { Bolton (1977), p. 11 } A combination thermal/photochemical cell has also been proposed. The Stanford PETE process uses solar thermal energy to raise the temperature of a thermionic metal to about 800C to increase the rate of production of electricity to electrolyse atmospheric CO2 down to carbon or carbon monoxide which can then be used for fuel production, and the waste heat can be used as well. { http://spacefellowship.com/news/art21587/solar-power-could-soon-compete-with-oil.html } [ Solar vehicles ] [ Solar vehicle Solar-charged vehicle Electric boat Solar balloon ] { World Solar Challenge where solar cars like the Nuna3 race through a } [ 3021 km mi on ] { course from Darwin to Adelaide. } Development of a solar powered car has been an engineering goal since the 1980s.

As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.

Unlike rockets, solar sails require no fuel. Although the thrust is small compared to rockets, it continues as long as the Sun shines onto the deployed sail and in the vacuum of space significant speeds can eventually be achieved.

[ Energy storage methods ] [ Thermal mass Thermal energy storage Phase change material Grid energy storage V2G ] Solar Two&apos;s thermal storage system generated electricity during cloudy weather and at night. Solar energy is not available at night, and energy storage is an important issue because modern energy systems usually assume continuous availability of energy. { Carr (1976), p. 85 } Thermal mass systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or seasonal durations. Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high specific heat capacities such as water, earth and stone. Well-designed systems can lower peak demand, shift time-of-use to off-peak hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements. { Balcomb(1992), p. 6 } [ Request for Participation Summer 2005 Demand Shifting with Thermal Mass Demand Response Research Center http://www.drrc.lbl.gov/pubs/RFP_071405.pdf 2007-11-26 PDF ] Phase change materials such as paraffin wax and Glauber&apos;s salt are another thermal storage media. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately 64  °C). The &quot; Dover House &quot; (in Dover, Massachusetts ) was the first to use a Glauber&apos;s salt heating system, in 1948. { Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 212–214 } Solar energy can be stored at high temperatures using molten salt s. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The Solar Two used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store 1.44   TJ in its 68   m 3 storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%. [ Advantages of Using Molten Salt Sandia National Laboratory http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm 2007-09-29 ] Off-grid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is often legally handled by &apos;rolling back&apos; the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility is required to pay for the extra at the same rate as they charge consumers. [ PV Systems and Net Metering Department of Energy http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html 2008-07-31 http://web.archive.org/web/20080704062311/http%3A//www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html 2008-07-04 ] Other legal approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water to run through a hydroelectric power generator.

The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th  century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum. { Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 63, 77, 101 } The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. { Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249 } { Yergin (1991), p. 634, 653-673 } Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the US (SERI, now NREL ), Japan ( NEDO ), and Germany ( Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE ). [ Chronicle of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp 2007-11-04 ] Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s. { Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 117 } These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. { Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 139 } As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and growth rates have averaged 20% per year since 1999.

The International Energy Agency has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces: The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared. In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaic panels, solar water heaters and power stations built with mirrors could provide a third of the world’s energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting climate change. The energy from the sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in energy efficiency and imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters. &quot; The strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale &quot;.
