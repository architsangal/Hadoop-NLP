It is also the core city of the largest micropolitan area in the United States. { Small-town USA goes micropolitan. 2004. October 18, 2006. &lt; http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2004-06-27-rural_x.htm &gt;. } The city population was 36,383 according to the 2010 census. Torrington is a former mill town, as are most other towns along the Naugatuck River Valley. It is currently competing with the neighboring city of Winsted to recreate a pleasant Main Street environment. Downtown Torrington is home to the Nutmeg Conservatory for the Arts, which trains ballet dancers and whose Company performs in the Warner Theatre, a 1,700 seat auditorium restored in 2002 to its original 1931 glory. The theater, while originally built as a cinema by the Warner Brothers film studio, has been reborn as a performing arts venue and arts instruction organization, and will serve as a cornerstone of the city&apos;s downtown revitalization project. Downtown Torrington also hosts the largest Lodge of Elks in New England. Elks Lodge #372 supports many community activities and events. The daily newspaper in town is The Register Citizen, a Journal Register Company publication that serves Torrington and Winsted, in addition to most of the Northwest Corner. Charlotte Hungerford Hospital has also developed into an important health care resource for the area. In 2008, Torrington was named by Bizjournals as the number one &quot; Dreamtown &quot; ( micropolitan statistical area ) out of ten in the United States to live in. [ History ] Torrington, originally Wolcottville, was first settled in 1735 by Ebenezer Lyman, Jr., of Durham, Connecticut. { Torrington was known as Wolcottville, after the Wolcott family of Connecticut, which produced several governors between 1813 and 1881. } Its early settlers resided on the hills west of the Naugatuck River where the first school, church, store, and tavern were constructed. Later, the eastern hill known as Torringford was settled, as it provided the best farmland. Torrington was given permission to organize a government and incorporate as a town in October 1740. The fast moving waters of the Naugatuck River were used to power early nineteenth-century industries. Industrial growth skyrocketed when Frederick Wolcott constructed a woolen mill in 1813. The mill attracted a large workforce and created demands for goods, services, and housing. From a postcard sent in 1906 Israel Coe and Erastus Hodges began the construction of two brass mills on the Naugatuck River in 1834. This event sparked the beginning of the brass industry in Torrington, which later would spread throughout the entire Naugatuck Valley. In 1849, the Naugatuck Valley railroad was completed, connecting Torrington with other population centers, ending its isolation, and stimulating further industrial growth. Soon, Torrington was producing a variety of metal products, including needles, brass, hardware, bicycles, and tacks. Torrington&apos;s growing industrial plants attracted English, Irish, and German immigrants throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Between 1880 and 1920, Torrington&apos;s population exploded from 3,000 to 22,000 as immigration from southern and eastern Europe increased; most immigrants during this period were Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, or Lebanese. Torrington was chartered as a city in 1923. In 1955, a massive flood destroyed much of the downtown area and other property in the region when Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane caused local rivers to overflow. Torrington is the birthplace of abolitionist John Brown.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 40.4  square miles (104.6  km²). Approximately 39.8  square miles (103.1  km²) of it is land and 1.5  km² (0.6 sq  mi or 1.41%) of it is water. The eastern and western sides of the city, at its borders, are at the tops of peaks, while the downtown and central sections of the city are in the Naugatuck River Valley. This provides some interesting views from the higher locations, with the city lights as a backdrop below. Due to the lack of suitable highways and bypass routes in an East/West direction, crossing the city requires driving down into the valley and back up the other side.

[ Downtown redevelopment ] Torrington is planning to revitalize its downtown area in an effort to attract residents and visitors to the city&apos;s shopping and cultural opportunities. These redevelopment plans are still in discussion and are not yet completed. The following ideas have been discussed: [ Coe Memorial Park restoration ] The historic restoration and renovation to downtown Coe Memorial Park were completed in the beginning of 2004. The Coe Memorial Park Subcommittee and the City of Torrington, worked closely with Ferrero Hixon Associates, to restore the Park to a Victorian walking park, much as it was when it was first gifted to the Town in 1906. These renovations included new sidewalks and paths, and the relocation of memorials and monuments. In 2005, award winning horticulturist, Gwenythe B. Harvey, owner of the firm The Garden Goddess, LLC, was hired to redefine, design and upgrade existing garden areas. Coe Memorial Park&apos;s Botanical Gardens has since become a well-known tourist destination. [ http://www.coeparkgardens.com/historicalpages1.html Coe Memorial Park Historical Page The Garden Goddess 9 October 2010 ] [ Retail expansion ] Torrington hopes to attract a wide variety of merchants into its downtown setting. Empty and abandoned buildings would be converted into a mix of retail, office, and residential space. A potential plan discusses the possibility of a national clothing retailer or bookstore chain constructing a location at the top of Water Street on the site of the Kelley Bus Company. This plan has come under fire by some because it involves the demolition of the former Torrington railroad station, which is considered by many to be historical. Despite this, the former Torrington railroad station was demolished, as a safety hazard, in 2011. The Torrington fire department noted that the roof was in such disrepair, and no funds were available to fix it, saving the station was not an option. A Big Y supermarket and a Lowe&apos;s Home Improvement store opened in the summer of 2009 on Winsted Road. [ Accessibility ] A parking garage is slated to be constructed in the heart of downtown on either Main Street or Water Street. The municipal parking lot next to the Torrington Library would also serve as a downtown parking area. Because the downtown redevelopment project emphasizes pedestrian access, brick sidewalks lined with trees, benches, and bike racks would be constructed along Main Street.

The city expects to convert Main Street into a one-way road with parking lining one side of the street. The neighboring Prospect Street would also be converted into a one-way road with traffic flowing in the opposite direction. Most of the roads are in medium to poor condition and filled with pot holes.

The abuse, attempted murder and lawsuit was later depicted in a 1989 made-for-TV movie A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story, starring Nancy McKeon. [ Transportation ] Three primary state highways meet in downtown Torrington: Route 8, Route 4, and Route 202. Other major roads include Route 183 and Route 272. The city is served by buses of the Northwestern Connecticut Transit District. [ Sports Teams/Events ] Baseball The new and improved Torrington Titans will now be playing in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League of New England. They played their inaugural season in the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league. After leading the ACBL in attendance in 2010, the team was sold to the Carminucci Sports Group (CSG), which transferred their affiliation to the Futures League. CSG owns both the Brockton Rox of the professional Can-Am League, and fellow Futures League affiliate the Martha&apos;s Vineyard Sharks. The Titans play their home games at Fuessenich Park in downtown Torrington, CT. The Titans&apos; field manager is Gregg Hunt. Hunt is the New England Collegiate Baseball League &apos;s all-time winningest field manager. Hunt began his tenure as manager of the Torrington Twisters and continued with the Titans. He is the longest tenured manager in all of New England summer collegiate baseball. [ September 2011 ] Hunt has coached four first round draft picks, including the Washington Nationals &apos; Stephen Strasburg. In 2009, an organization called Our Baseball Haven, introduced a unique concept and proposal through which a collegiate baseball team could once again call Torrington its home. The concept, called &quot; crowdsourcing &quot; was supported by some five hundred individuals and the Peekskill (NY) Robins of the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League (ACBL) were moved to Torrington and their name changed to the Torrington Titans. The Titans capped their successful 2010 inaugural season by winning the Kaiser Division. The Torrington Twisters were a member of the New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL) from 1997-2008. Torrington twice played host to the league All-Star Game (1998, 2008) and generally placed high in their division each season. The organization shipped out in the middle of the night to Massachusetts in 2008 leaving bitter feelings by the community with both the NECBL and the ownership group. A professional baseball team once located in the city was known as the Torrington Braves, and were a member of the Colonial League. After just one season, 1950, they disbanded. Running The Torrington Road Race is a five-mile (8  km) run, which coincides with Donor&apos;s Week in August. Starting at Coe Memorial Park, the course extends to the farther reaches of the valley, including Riverside Avenue, Migeon Avenue, Prospect Street and others. The race, which started in 1972, primarily includes runners from around Connecticut and has also attracted some runners each year from Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
