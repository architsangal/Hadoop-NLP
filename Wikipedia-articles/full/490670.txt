IgE was discovered in 1966 by the Japan ese scientist couple Teruko and Kimishige Ishizaka. [ Ishizaka K, Ishizaka T, Hornbrook MM Physico-chemical properties of human reaginic antibody. IV. Presence of a unique immunoglobulin as a carrier of reaginic activity J. Immunol. 97 1 75–85 1966 4162440 ] [ Receptors ] IgE elicits an immune response by binding to Fc receptor s found on the surface of mast cell s and basophil s, and are also found on eosinophil s, monocyte s, macrophage s and platelet s in humans. Fcε has two types: FcεRI, the high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRII, also known as CD23, is the low-affinity IgE receptor IgE can upregulate the expression of both Fcε receptors. FcεRI is expressed only on mast cells and/or basophils in both mice and humans. Aggregation of antigen s and binding of IgE to the FcεRI on mast cells causes degranulation and the release of mediators from the cells, while basophils cross-linked with IgE release type 2 cytokine s like interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) and other inflammatory mediators. The low-affinity receptor (FcεRII) is always expressed on B cell s, but its expression can be induced on the surfaces of macrophage s, eosinophil s, platelet s, and some T cell s by IL-4. [ October 2010 ] [ Physiology ] There is much speculation into what physiological benefits IgE contributes, and, so far, circumstantial evidence in animal models and statistical population trends have hinted that IgE may be beneficial in fighting gut parasites such as Schistosoma mansoni, but this has not been conclusively proven in humans. Although it is not yet well understood, IgE may play an important role in the immune system’s recognition of cancer, [ Karagiannis S Activity of human monocytes in IgE antibody-dependent surveillance and killing of ovarian tumor cells Eur J Immunol 33 4 1030–1040 2003 12672069 10.1002/eji.200323185, 1 Wang Qin East Nick Burke Frances Riffard Stephane Bracher Marguerite G. Thompson Richard G. Durham Stephen R. Schwartz Lawrence B. ] in which the stimulation of a strong cytotoxic response against cells displaying only small amounts of early cancer markers would be beneficial. Of course, if this were the case, anti-IgE treatments such as omalizumab (for asthma) might have some undesirable side effects. [ Role in disease ] Atopic individuals can have up to 10 times the normal level of IgE in their blood (as do sufferers of hyper-IgE syndrome ). However, this may not be a requirement for symptoms to occur as has been seen in asthmatics with normal IgE levels in their blood - recent research has shown that IgE production can occur locally in the nasal mucosa. [ Takhar P Allergen drives class switching to IgE in the nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis J Immunol 174 8 5024–32 2005 15814733, 1 Smurthwaite L Coker HA Fear DJ Banfield GK Carr VA Durham SR Gould HJ ] IgE that can specifically recognise an &quot; allergen &quot; (typically this is a protein, such as dust mite DerP1, cat Fel d 1, grass or ragweed pollen, etc.) has a unique long-lived interaction with its high-affinity receptor FcεRI so that basophils and mast cells, capable of mediating inflammatory reactions, become &quot; primed &quot;, ready to release chemicals like histamine, leukotriene s, and certain interleukins, which cause many of the symptoms we associate with allergy, such as airway constriction in asthma, local inflammation in eczema, increased mucus secretion in allergic rhinitis, and increased vascular permeability, it is presumed, to allow other immune cells to gain access to tissues, but which can lead to a potentially fatal drop in blood pressure as in anaphylaxis. Although the mechanisms of each response are fairly well understood, why some allergics develop such drastic sensitivities when others merely get a runny nose is still one of science&apos;s hot topics. Regulation of IgE levels through control of B cell differentiation to antibody-secreting plasma cells is thought to involve the &quot; low-affinity &quot; receptor FcεRII, or CD23 [ August 2008 ]. CD23 may also allow facilitated antigen presentation, an IgE-dependent mechanism whereby B cells expressing CD23 are able to present allergen to (and stimulate) specific T helper cells, causing the perpetuation of a Th2 response, one of the hallmarks of which is the production of more antibodies. [ Pharmacology ] IgE may be an important target in treatments for allergy and asthma. Currently, severe allergy and asthma is usually treated with drugs (like anti-histamines) that damp down the late stages of inflammation and relax airway smooth muscle. However, these treatments are fairly broad in their action, so many have unpleasant side-effects; they may also inhibit important protective responses. [ September 2008 ] In 2002, researchers at The Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics determined the structure of IgE. [ Wan T The crystal structure of IgE Fc reveals an asymmetrically bent conformation Nat Immunol 3 7 681–686 2002 12068291 10.1038/ni811, 1 Beavil Rebecca L. Fabiane Stella M. Beavil Andrew J. Sohi Maninder K. Keown Maura Young Robert J. Henry Alistair J. Owens Ray J. ] Understanding of this structure (which is atypical of other isotypes in that it is highly bent and asymmetric) and of the interaction of IgE with receptor FcεRI will enable development of a new generation of allergy drugs that seek to interfere with the IgE-receptor interaction. A new treatment, omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, recognises IgE not bound to its receptor and is used to neutralise or mop-up existing IgE and prevent it from binding to cells. It may be possible to design treatments cheaper than monoclonal antibodies (for instance, small molecule drugs) that use a similar approach to inhibit binding of IgE to its receptor.
