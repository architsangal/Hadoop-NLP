[ Abomasum (PSF).png 250px Rough illustration of a ruminant digestive system Ruminants Animal ia Chordata Mammal ia Artiodactyla Ruminantia Families Antilocapridae Bovidae Cervidae Giraffidae Moschidae Tragulidae ] A ruminant is a mammal of the order Artiodactyla that digests plant-based food by initially softening it within the animal&apos;s first compartment of the stomach, principally through bacterial actions, then regurgitating the semi-digested mass, now known as cud, and chewing it again. The process of rechewing the cud to further break down plant matter and stimulate digestion is called &quot; ruminating &quot;. [ Ruminant Digestive System http://faculty.fortlewis.edu/LASHELL_B/Nutr2-Rumdigestion.pdf ] There are about 150 species of ruminants which include both domestic and wild species. Ruminating mammals include cattle, goat s, sheep, giraffe s, bison, moose, elk, yak s, water buffalo, deer, camel s, alpaca s, llama s, antelope, pronghorn, and nilgai.Taxonomically, the suborder Ruminantia includes all those species except the camels, llamas, and alpacas, which are Tylopoda. Therefore, the term &apos;ruminant&apos; is not synonymous with Ruminantia. The word &quot; ruminant &quot; comes from the Latin ruminare, which means &quot; to chew over again &quot;. [ Explanation ] Food digestion in the simple stomach of non-ruminant animals versus ruminants Russell,J. B. 2002. Rumen Microbiology and its role In Ruminant Nutrition. The primary difference between a ruminant and non-ruminant (called monogastric s, such as humans, dogs, and pigs) is that ruminants have a four-compartment stomach. The four parts of the stomach are rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud or bolus. The cud is then regurgitated, chewed to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size. Fiber, especially cellulose and hemi-cellulose, is primarily broken down into the three volatile fatty acids (VFAs), acetic acid, propanoic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid, in these chambers by microbes (mostly bacteria and well as some protozoa, fungi and yeast ). Protein and non-structural carbohydrate ( pectin, sugars, starches ) are also fermented. Even though the rumen and reticulum have different names they represent the same functional space as digesta can move back and forth between them. Together these chambers are called the reticulorumen. The degraded digesta, which is now in the lower liquid part of the reticulorumen, then passes into the next chamber, the omasum, where water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream. After this the digesta is moved to the true stomach, the abomasum. The abomasum is the direct equivalent of the monogastric stomach (for example that of the human or pig), and digesta is digested here in much the same way. Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulorumen are also digested in the small intestine. Fermentation continues in the large intestine in the same way as in the reticulorumen. Only small amounts of glucose are absorbed from dietary carbohydrates. Most dietary carbohydrates are fermented into VFAs in the rumen. The glucose needed as energy for the brain and for lactose and milk fat in milk production, as well as other uses, comes from non-sugar sources such as the VFA propionate, glycerol, lactate and protein. The VFA propionate is used for around 70% of the glucose and glycogen produced and protein for another 20% (50% under starvation conditions). { William O. Reece (2005).

R. R. 1989. &quot; Evolutionary steps of ecophysiological and diversification of ruminants :a comparative view of their digestive system &quot;. Oecologia, 78:443-457 } There are also pseudo-ruminants having three-compartment stomach instead of four like ruminants. Monogastric animals such as Guinea pigs, horses and rabbits are not ruminants as they have a simple single-chambered stomach and digest cellulose via an enlarged cecum allowing the easy digestion of fibrous materials. Such animals are called hindgut fermenters. [ Abundance, distribution, and domestication ] Wild ruminants number at least 75 million and are native to all continents except Australia and Antarctica. Nearly 90% of all species are found in Eurasia and Africa alone. Species inhabit a wide range of climates (from tropic to arctic) and habitats (from open plains to forests). { Hackmann. T. J., and Spain, J. N. 2010. &quot; Ruminant ecology and evolution: Perspectives useful to livestock research and production &quot;. Journal of Dairy Science, 93:1320-1334 } The population of domestic ruminants is greater than 3.5 billion, with cattle, sheep, and goats accounting for about 95% of the total population. Goats were domesticated in the Near East at approximately 8,000 B.C. Most other species were domesticated by 2,500 B.C., either in the Near East or southern Asia. { Hackmann. T. J., and Spain, J. N. 2010. &quot; Ruminant ecology and evolution: Perspectives useful to livestock research and production &quot;. Journal of Dairy Science, 93:1320-1334 } [ Ruminant physiology ] Ruminating animals have various physiological features which enable them to survive in nature. One feature of ruminants is their continuously growing teeth. During grazing, the silica content in forage causes abrasion of teeth. Abrasion of the teeth is compensated by continuous tooth growth throughout the ruminant&apos;s life, as opposed to humans or other non-ruminants whose teeth stop growing after a particular age. Most ruminants do not have upper incisors; instead they have a thick dental pad to thoroughly bite food. { Colorado State University, Hypertexts for Biomedical Science: Dental Anatomy of Ruminants } Camels and llamas are exceptions; their dentition shows traces of vesitigial central incisors in the upper jaw. [ Rumen microbiology ] Vertebrate s lack the ability to hydrolyse beta [1-4] glycosidic bond of plant cellulose due to the lack of an enzyme celulase. Thus ruminants must completely depend upon the microbial flora, present in rumen or hindgut, so as to digest cellulose. Digestion of food in rumen is primarily carried out by the rumen microflora which contain dense populations of several species of bacteria, protozoa, sometimes yeasts and fungi. It is estimated that 1mm of rumen contains 10-50 billion bacteria, 1 million protozoa and several yeasts, fungi. { Rumen ecology } As the environment inside a rumen is anaerobic, most of these microbial species are obligate or facultative anaerobes which can decompose complex plant material such as cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, protein s. Hydrolysis of cellulose results in sugars which are further fermentated to acetate, lactate, propionate, butyrate, carbon dioxide and methane. During grazing, ruminants produce large amount of saliva. Estimates are within 100 to 150 litres of saliva per day for an adult cow. { Some physical and chemical properties of Bovine saliva which may affect rumen digestion and synthesis Journal of Dairy Science Vol 32 (2), p. 123-132, 1949. } The role of saliva is to provide ample fluid for rumen fermentation and as a buffering agent. { Rumen physiology } Rumen fermentation produces large amounts of organic acids and thus maintaining the appropriate pH of rumen fluids is a critical factor in rumen fermentation. [ Tannin toxicity in ruminant animals ] Tannin s are phenolic compounds that are commonly found in plants. These compounds play a role in protection from predation, as well as growth regulation, when they are digested by herbivore s. Found in the leaf, bud, seed, root, and stem tissues, tannins are widely distributed in many different species of plants. Tannins are separated into two classes: hydrolysable tannins and condensed tannin s. Depending on their concentration and nature either class can have adverse or beneficial effects. When ruminants digest some plants, they acquire a surplus of tannins and rumen microbe s do not have the enzymatic ability for degrading condensed tannins. In fact, digestion of tannins by ruminants in large amounts can reduce the activity and the proliferation of ruminal microorganisms reducing ruminal biohydrogenation. [ Vasta, V., H. P. S. Makkar, M. Mele, and A. Priolo Ruminal biohydrogenation as affected by tannins in vitro Br. J. Nutr 2009 102 82–92 ] Tannins can also precipitate proteins and inhibit the absorption of nutrients. [ Bate-Smith and Swain Flavonoid compounds Florkin M., Mason H.S. Comparative biochemistry Academic Press New York 1962 75–809 III ] Very high levels of tannin intake can produce toxicity that can even cause death. Animals normally consuming tannin-rich plants can develop defensive mechanisms against tannins, such as the strategic deployment of lipid s and extracellular polysaccharide s that have a high affinity to binding to tannins. [ Min, B. R., T. N. Barry, G. T. Attwood, and W. C. McNabb. The effect of condensed tannins on the nutrition and health of ruminants fed fresh temperate forages: a review. Anim. Feed Sci. Technol 2003 106:3–19 ] These mechanisms prevent tannins from causing adverse effects on rumen microbes. [ Religious importance ] The Law of Moses in the Bible allowed only the eating of animals that had cloven hooves and &quot; that chew the cud &quot;, [ Bible King James Leviticus 11 6 ] a stipulation preserved to this day in Jewish dietary laws. [ Other uses ] The verb to ruminate has been extended metaphor ically to mean to ponder thoughtfully or to meditate on some topic. Similarly, ideas may be chewed on or digested. Chew the (one&apos;s) cud is to reflect or meditate. In psychology, &quot; rumination &quot; refers to a pattern of thinking, and is unrelated to digestive physiology. [ Ruminants and climate change ] [ Climate change and agriculture ] Methane has 23 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide and its production by ruminants may contribute to a greenhouse effect or climate change. Methane production by animals, principally ruminants, is estimated 15-20% global production of methane. { Cicerone, R. J., and R. S. Oremland. 1988 &quot; Biogeochemical Aspects of Atmospheric Methane &quot; } { Yavitt, J. B. 1992. Methane, biogeochemical cycle. Pages 197–207 in Encyclopedia of Earth System Science, Vol. 3. Acad.Press, London, England. } The rumen is the major site of methane production in ruminants. { Asanuma. N., M. Iwamoto, T. Hino. 1999. &quot; Effect of the addition of fumarate on methane production by ruminal microorganisms in vitro. &quot; J.
