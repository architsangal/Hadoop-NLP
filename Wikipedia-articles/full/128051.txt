[ History ] The Mount Gilead Downtown Historic District is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The town was incorporated in 1899. Local resident Bob Jordan is a former Lt. Governor of N.C. Mayor Jimmy Haithcock was the longest serving mayor, having served 33 years and David Wilder served as a town commissioner for 40 years. Like many small southern towns, Mount Gilead suffered decline with the loss of textile jobs. However, the town is in the process of reinventing itself. Mount Gilead was recently selected to participate in the N.C. Small Town Main Street Program and received a S.T.E.P. (Small Town Economic Prosperity) grant of $220,000 to help revitalize the downtown area and create jobs, respectively. The Mount Gilead Museum is located in a restored Victorian house near the downtown area. The house belonged to the McAulay family who played an important role in Mount Gilead business, church, social, and civic life. The museum houses many documents, photographs, and historic artifacts that tell the story of Mount Gilead&apos;s past. Mount Gilead is the birthplace of noted civil rights attorney Julius L. Chambers (b. 1936). A graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (J.D., 1962), Chambers served as editor-in-chief of the school&apos;s Law Review and went on to earn his master of law degree from Columbia University in 1964. That summer he opened in Charlotte, NC, an office that would become the state&apos;s first integrated law practice. Chambers and his founding partners, James E. Ferguson, II and Adam Stein, working with lawyers of the Legal Defense Fund, successfully litigated civil rights cases and helped shape the contours of civil rights law by winning landmark United States Supreme Court rulings in such cases as Swann v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971), the famous school busing decision, and Griggs v. Duke Power Co. 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971) and Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405 (1975), two of the Supreme Court&apos;s most significant Title VII employment discrimination decisions. { http://www.law.unc.edu/faculty/directory/chambersjuliusl/ } [ Arts ] The Piedmont Center of the Arts and The Ford Place Restaurant, Pub &amp; Special Events Center were two projects which were successfully created as a result of funds from the North Carolina Rural Center.
