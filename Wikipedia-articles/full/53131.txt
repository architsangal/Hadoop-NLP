Theatre owner James Nederlander as well as The New York Times { The New York Times, 2006-05-01 } have referred to Blaine as a modern day Houdini. [ Early life ] Blaine was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and is of Puerto Rican descent on his father&apos;s side, and Russian Jewish on his mother&apos;s. His mother, Patrice Maureen White (1946–1995), { Record of Maureen P. Bukalo, } { Social Security Deat Index. } was a school teacher living in New York, and his father William Perez was a Vietnam veteran.When he was four years old, he saw a magician performing magic in the subway.

Due to the intense weather, no cars or taxis were on the road, so Blaine had to hail a snowplow, which transported the couple to the hospital. { http://www.usmagazine.com/momsbabies/news/david-blaines-magical-baby-snow-plow-ride-201132 } [ Stunts and specials ] [ Street Magic and Magic Man ] On May 19, 1997, Blaine&apos;s first television special, David Blaine: Street Magic aired on the ABC network. According to the New York Daily News, “Blaine can lay claim to his own brand of wizardry. The magic he offers in tonight’s show operates on an uncommonly personal level.” { Magic special turns out to be both, } { Daily News (New York), 1997-05-19 } When asked about his performance style, David explained, “I&apos;d like to bring magic back to the place it used to be 100 years ago.”&apos; { If He Can Conjure Magical Ratings, That&apos;s Some Trick, } { The New York Times, 1997-05-11 } Time magazine commented, &quot; his deceptively low-key, ultracool manner leaves spectators more amazed than if he&apos;d razzle-dazzled. &quot; { The Wizard of Grunge, } { Time, 1997-05-19 } The concept of focusing on spectator reactions (for example, in his rendition of the Balducci levitation ) changed the way that magic has been shown on TV. The New York Times wrote, “He&apos;s taken a craft that&apos;s been around for hundreds of years and done something unique and fresh with it. &quot; Penn Jillette, of Penn &amp; Teller, stated, &quot; the biggest break through done in our lifetime was David Blaine&apos;s &apos;Street Magic,&apos; where his idea was to do really simple tricks but to concentrate... to turn the camera around on the people watching instead of the people doing. So to make the audience watch the audience, which that first special &apos;Street Magic,&apos; is the best TV magic special ever done and really, really does break new ground. &quot; { What Will Magic Be Like in the Future? } { Big Think, 2010-07-08 } In Magic Man, Blaine is shown traveling across the country, entertaining unsuspecting pedestrians in New York City, Atlantic City, Dallas, San Francisco, Compton, and the Mojave Desert recorded by a small crew with handheld cameras. Jon Racherbaumer commented, &quot; Make no mistake about it, the focus of this show, boys and girls, is not Blaine. It is really about theatrical proxemics; about the show-within-a-show and the spontaneous, visceral reactions of people being astonished. &quot; [ http://www.magicdirectory.com/blaine/magic1.shtml Bingo Bango!

According to CNN, &quot; Blaine&apos;s only communication to the outside world was by a hand buzzer, which could have alerted an around-the-clock emergency crew standing by. &quot; BBC News reported that the cramped plastic coffin offered six inches (152  mm) of headroom and two inches on each side. During the endurance stunt Blaine ate nothing and drank only two to three tablespoons of water a day. { Magician surfaces from watery grave after weeklong burial, } { CNN, 1999-04-12 } An estimated 75,000 people visited the site, including Marie Blood, Harry Houdini &apos;s niece, who said, &quot; My uncle did some amazing things, but he could not have done this. &quot; { Kuntzman, Gersh.

And I’m not just talking entertainment.” { Shallow Grave, } { Time Out New York, 1999-04-01 } [ Frozen in Time ] { Times Square, } { New York. } On November 27, 2000, Blaine began a stunt called &quot; Frozen in Time &quot;, which was covered on a TV special. Blaine stood encased in a massive block of ice located in Times Square, New York City. He was lightly dressed and seen to be shivering even before the blocks of ice were sealed around him. A tube supplied him with air and water while his urine was removed with another tube. He was encased in the box of ice for 63 hours, 42 minutes and 15 seconds before being removed with chain saws. The ice was transparent and resting on an elevated platform to show that he was actually inside the ice the entire time. CNN confirmed that &quot; thousands of people braved the pouring rain Wednesday night to catch a glimpse of Blaine as workers cut away at the ice. &quot; { Illusionist freed from icy confines after 62 hours, } { CNN, 2000-11-30 } He was removed from the ice in an obviously dazed and disoriented state, wrapped in blankets and taken to the hospital immediately because doctors feared he might be going into shock. { David Blaine0 – Fearless (DVD), Buena Vista Home Entertainment, shows footage of his hospitalization including the exclamation &quot; He is going into shock! &quot; } The New York Times reported, &quot; The magician who emerged from the increasingly unstable ice box seemed a shadow of the confident, robust, shirtless fellow who entered two days before. &quot; { McKinley, Jesse. Magician Emerges From Icy Stunt, } { The New York Times, November 30, 2000. Accessed April 27, 2012. } Blaine said in the documentary follow-up to this feat that it took a month before he was able to walk again and that he had no plans to ever again attempt a stunt of this difficulty. [ December 2011 ] { Bryant Park in } { New York. } [ Vertigo ] On May 22, 2002, a crane lifted Blaine onto a 100-foot (30 m) high and 22-inch (0.56 m) wide pillar in Bryant Park, New York City. Although he was not harnessed to the pillar, there were two retractable handles on either side of him to grasp in the event of harsh weather. { Burkeman, Oliver. New York&apos;s pillar-dweller jumps, } { The Guardian, May 23, 2002. Accessed April 27, 2012. } The Evening Standard &apos;s James Langton wrote, &quot; He was battered by high winds and unusually cold May weather during his first night and would have been killed or seriously injured if he had fallen. &quot; { Langton, James. Blaine drops from 100ft pole, } { Evening Standard, May 23, 2002. Accessed April 27, 2012. } He remained on the pillar for exactly 35 hours. The New Yorker ’s Adam Gopnik wrote, “David Blaine, standing up there, is actually as good a magical metaphor for the moment as Houdini, fighting his way out of the straitjacket of immigrant identity toward prosperity, was for his. &quot; { Gopnik, Adam. Up in the Air, } { The New Yorker, June 3, 2002. Accessed April 27, 2012. } With his legs weak from standing atop the pillar for so long, he ended the feat by jumping down onto a landing platform made out of a 12-foot (3.7 m) high pile of cardboard boxes and suffered a mild concussion.

Editing director, Bruce Tracy, explains “David Blaine is the most exciting and creative magician since Houdini, and now, readers have the opportunity to enjoy Blaine&apos;s unique book about magic, and they can participate by testing their own ability to discover and interpret clues.” { BEA Show Daily: Can We Interest You in $100,000?, } { Publishers Weekly, 2002-05-03 } The treasure hunt, Blaine&apos;s $100,000 Challenge, was devised by game designer Cliff Johnson, creator of The Fool&apos;s Errand, and solved by Sherri Skanes on March 20, 2004, 16 months after the book&apos;s publication. { The Armchair Treasure Hunt Club Mysterious Stranger: A Book of Magic, } { The Armchair Treasure Hunt Club } [ Above the Below ] { City Hall (London). } On September 5, 2003, Blaine began his 44-day endurance stunt sealed inside a transparent Plexiglas case suspended 9 metres (30  ft) in the air next to Potters Fields Park on the south bank of the River Thames, the area between City Hall and Tower Bridge in London. The case, measuring [ 3 ft m 1 ] by [ 7 ft m ] by [ 7 ft m ], had a webcam installed so that viewers could observe his progress. During the 44-day period, Blaine went without any food or nutrients and survived on just 4.5 litres of water per day. The endurance stunt became the subject of much media attention. The Guardian wrote, &quot; Blaine has created one of the most eloquent and telling visual images of our time. &quot; { Lawson, Mark. People are not cartoons, } { The Guardian, September 27, 2003. Accessed April 27, 2012. } The Times reported that &quot; 1,614 articles in the British press have made reference to the exploit. &quot; { Illusionist and the facts of life, 2003-10-20 } Then U.S. President George W. Bush referred to Blaine’s stunt in a speech at the Whitehall Palace in London, saying “The last noted American to visit London stayed in a glass box dangling over the Thames. A few might have been happy to provide similar arrangements for me.” { Remarks by the President Bush at Whitehall, &quot; From 9-11 to the Iraq War 2003 &quot;, 2003-11-19 } A number of spectators were mischievous or hostile towards the endurance artist. The Times reported that eggs, lemons, sausages, bacon, water bottles, beer cans, paint-filled balloons and golf balls had all been thrown at the box. The Evening Standard reported that one man was arrested for attempting to spike the water supply to Blaine&apos;s box with monkey urine. { Blaine cage attack, } { Evening Standard, 2003-09-16 } According to BBC News, a hamburger was flown up to the box by a remote-controlled helicopter as a taunt. { 2003: David Blaine ends glass box stunt, } { BBC News, 2003-10-19 } On September 25, BBC News reported that Blaine announced via webcam that he was feeling the taste of pear drops on his tongue. { What&apos;s going on inside David Blaine&apos;s body?, } { BBC News Online, 2003-09-25 } Dr. Adam Carey, who performed a medical examination of Blaine before he entered the box, said that the taste was produced by ketones produced by the body burning fatty acids, which are themselves produced from fat reserves. Blaine emerged on schedule on October 19, murmuring &quot; I love you all! &quot; and was quickly hospitalized. The New England Journal of Medicine published a paper that documented his 44 day fast and stated that his re-feeding was perhaps the most dangerous part of the stunt.

His appearance and body-mass index after his fast would not by themselves have alerted us to the risks of refeeding. Despite cautious management, he had hypophosphatemia and fluid retention, important elements of the refeeding syndrome.” { Refeeding David Blaine: studies after a 44-day fast &quot;, David Blaine Library } The event was filmed by director, and close friend of Blaine, Harmony Korine.

In an interview on The Howard Stern Show on Sirius satellite radio, Blaine spoke of the week-long fasting he did before the &quot; drowning alive &quot; stunt, to avoid having to be concerned with defecation. [ Revolution ] On November 19, 2006, Blaine announced his next stunt: he would be shackled to a rotating gyroscope. His goal was to escape from his shackles after the gyroscope had been spinning for 16 hours. The gyroscope was constantly spinning at a rate of eight revolutions per minute while hanging above an empty lot in Manhattan near Times Square. The stunt began on November 21, 2006, with Blaine declaring, &quot; This one&apos;s exciting for me. This one&apos;s a fun one. &quot; 52 hours later, without food or water, a dehydrated and weakened Blaine landed on a wooden platform [ 30 ft m ] below after jumping from the hanging gyroscope.

Blaine said the stunt was particularly important since The Salvation Army had provided him with clothing while he was growing up. &quot; This challenge is close to my heart, &quot; Blaine said.

This faster heart rate increases oxygen consumption leading to painful carbon dioxide buildup. In the final minute, his heart rate became erratic and Blaine became worried he might blackout.

Ultimately, Blaine held his breath for 17 minutes 4½ seconds, surpassing Colat&apos;s previous mark of 16 minutes 32 seconds. This was Blaine&apos;s first Guinness record and it stood for almost four and a half months, until surpassed by Tom Sietas on September 19, 2008. During the following interview, Blaine stated: &quot; I really thought I was not going to make it, &quot; claiming that he did so by staying in a meditative state which was helped by the studio lights reflecting off the sphere. According to Blaine, besides the pressure of performing on television, the heart-rate monitor happened to be close enough to his ear so that he heard its beeping, and he had to keep his feet locked in holds at the bottom of the sphere — instead of just floating freely, as he did in the pool on Grand Cayman months earlier. Back then he said he was so relaxed he &quot; wasn’t even there &quot; during most of the breath-hold. But when he emerged from the sphere today, he told Oprah, &quot; I was pretty much here the whole time. &quot; [ Dive of Death ] { Donald Trump with David Blaine announcing Blaine&apos;s next event in the atrium of the Trump Tower. } On September 18, 2008, Donald Trump and Blaine held a press conference at the Trump Tower in New York City to announce his latest feat, “The Upside Down Man.” Blaine was to hang upside down without a safety net for 60 hours above Central Park ’s Wollman Rink, with a predicted end for 10:45 p.m. on September 24. Reportedly, Blaine risked blindness and other maladies in the stunt including having to repeatedly defecate in his own pants. { Blaine Stunt Could Cause Blindness, } { The Associated Press } Trump has helped finance this and other Blaine events. Blaine hung over the Wollman Rink and interacted with fans by lowering himself upside down. At the press conference, Blaine stated he had already gone without food for over a week and would continue to do so throughout the act. In order to drink fluid and restore circulation, he would pull himself up, all the while contending with muscle spasms and lack of sleep. Blaine began the stunt on Monday September 22, but was widely criticized when, only hours into the endurance challenge, he was seen by fans to be standing on a waiting crane platform, and not upside down, as expected. { David Blaine is only upside down for 50 minutes per hour - MyParkMag } He reportedly would come down once an hour to receive a medical check, stretch and relieve himself.

He was then pulled back up into the air, and, in the words of the &apos;&apos;Daily News&apos;&apos; (New York), &quot; hung in the air like a sack of potatoes with a goofy grin on his face, occasionally kicking his legs as though he were running. &quot; { &apos;&apos;David Blaine: President Bush&apos;s speech messed up my &apos;&apos;Dive of Death&apos;&apos;, } { &apos;&apos;Daily News&apos;&apos; (New York), September 25, 2008 } The plan had been for Blaine to be pulled up into the air by helium balloons and disappear into the atmosphere.
