These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water. Magnesium chloride as the natural mineral bischofite is also extracted (solution mining) out of ancient seabeds; for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form usually used in prescription oral magnesium supplements. [ Structure, preparation, and general properties ] MgCl 2 crystallizes in the cadmium chloride motif, which features octahedral Mg. A variety of hydrates are known with the formula MgCl 2 (H 2 O) x, and each loses water with increasing temperature: x = 12 (-16.4 °C), 8 (-3.4 °C), 6 (116.7 °C), 4 (181 °C), 2 (ca. 300 °C). { Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. &quot; Inorganic Chemistry &quot; Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5. } In the hexahydrate, the Mg 2+ remains octahedral, but is coordinated to six water ligand s. { Wells, A. F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. ISBN 0-19-855370-6. } The thermal dehydration of the hydrates MgCl 2 (H 2 O) x (x = 6, 12) does not occur straightforwardly. { see notes in Rieke, R. D.; Bales, S. E.; Hudnall, P. M.; Burns, T. P.; Poindexter, G S. “Highly Reactive Magnesium for the Preparation of Grignard Reagents: 1-Norbornane Acid” Organic Syntheses, Collected Volume 6, p.845 (1988). http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV6P0845.pdf } As suggested by the existence of some hydrates, anhydrous MgCl 2 is a Lewis acid, although a very weak one. In the Dow process, magnesium chloride is regenerated from magnesium hydroxide using hydrochloric acid : (aq) + 2 H 2 O ( l )It can also be prepared from magnesium carbonate by a similar reaction. In most of its derivatives, MgCl 2 forms octahedral complexes. Derivatives with tetrahedral Mg 2+ are less common. Examples include salts of ( tetraethylammonium ) 2 MgCl 4 and adduct s such as MgCl Mg(OH) 2 ( s ) + 2 HCl → MgCl 2 ( TMEDA ). N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, Chemistry of the Elements, Pergamon Press, 1984. Johnathan [ Applications ] Magnesium chloride serves as precursor to other magnesium compounds, for example by precipitation: MgCl 2 ( aq ) + Ca(OH) 2 (aq) → Mg(OH) 2 ( s ) + CaCl 2 (aq) It can be electrolysed to give magnesium metal: { Hill, Petrucci, McCreary, Perry, &quot; General Chemistry &quot;, 4th ed., Pearson/Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, USA. } MgCl 2 ( l ) → Mg( l ) + Cl 2 ( g ) This process is practiced on a substantial scale. Magnesium chloride is used for a variety of other applications besides the production of magnesium : the manufacture of textiles, paper, fireproofing agents, cement s and refrigeration brine, and dust and erosion control. Mixed with hydrated magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride forms a hard material called Sorel cement. Magnesium ion Mg 2+ (usually added as the chloride) is an important component in the polymerase chain reaction, a procedure used to amplify DNA fragments. It is generally used in experimental biology whenever RNA and DNA and their enzymes are to function in vitro, since Mg 2+ is a necessary associate ion for nucleotide s in biology, such as ATP. Magnesium chloride is also used in several medical and topical (skin related) applications. It has been used in pills as supplemental sources of magnesium, where it serves as a soluble compound which is not as laxative as magnesium sulfate, and more bioavailable than magnesium hydroxide and magnesium oxide, since it does not require stomach acid to produce soluble Mg 2+ ion. It can also be used as an effective anaesthetic for cephalopods, some species of crustaceans, { http://webs.lander.edu/rsfox/invertebrates/homarus.html } and several species of bivalve, including oysters. { Culloty, S.C. &amp; Mukahy, M.F. 1992. An evaluation of anaesthetics for Ostrea edulis (L.). Aquaculture. 107: 249-252. } [ Culinary use ] Magnesium chloride ( E511 [ Food Standard Agency Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist 22 March 2010 ] ) is an important coagulant used in the preparation of tofu from soy milk. In Japan it is sold as nigari ( にがり, derived from the Japanese word for &quot; bitter &quot; ), a white powder produced from seawater after the sodium chloride has been removed, and the water evaporated. In China it is called lushui ( 卤水 ). Nigari or lushui consists mostly of magnesium chloride, with some magnesium sulfate and other trace elements. It is also an ingredient in baby formula milk. [ Use in Gardening and Horticulture ] Because magnesium is a mobile nutrient, magnesium chloride can be effectively used as a substitute for Magnesium Sulfate (Epsom Salt) to help correct magnesium deficiency in plants via foliar feeding. It is advisable to use a smaller dose when using magnesium chloride compared to the recommended dose of magnesium sulfate (20 g/L). { [pubs.aic.ca/doi/pdf/10.4141/cjps85-018 Comparison of Magnesium Sulfate and THIS Mg Chelate Foliar Sprays] } This is due primarily to the chlorine present in magnesium chloride, which can easily reach toxic levels if over-applied and/or applied too often. { Magnesium Chloride Toxicity in Trees } It has been found that higher concentrations of magnesium in tomato and some pepper plants can make them more susceptible to disease caused by infection of the bacteria Xanthomonas campestris, since Mg is essential for bacterial growth. { Effect of Foliar and Soil Magnesium Application on Bacterial Leaf Spot of Peppers } [ Use as an anti-icer ] Picture of truck applying liquid de-icer (magnesium chloride) to city streets. Picture of solid form of rock salt used for ice removal on streets. Generally, all ice melters work in the same way by depressing the freezing point of ice or snow and turning the mixture into a liquid or semi-liquid slush. A number of state highway departments throughout the United States have decreased the use of rock salt and sand on roadways and have increased the use of solutions of magnesium chloride (often called &quot; liquid magnesium chloride &quot; ) as a de-icer or anti-icer. Magnesium chloride is less toxic to plant life surrounding highways and airports, and is less corrosive to concrete and steel (and other iron alloys) than sodium chloride. Nevertheless, magnesium chloride (CAS# 7786-30-3), calcium chloride (CAS# 010043-52-4) and sodium chloride (CAS# 007647-14-5) can be slightly toxic when applied directly in large amounts to grass, bushes, and trees. Airports prefer potassium compounds such as potassium acetate as a deicer instead of chloride salts because it offers the advantage of being less aggressive on soils and is much less corrosive, and for this reason it is preferred for airport runways. It is, however, more expensive.The liquid magnesium chloride is sprayed on dry pavement (tarmac) prior to precipitation or wet pavement prior to freezing temperatures in the winter months to prevent snow and ice from adhering and bonding to the roadway. The application of anti-icers is utilized in an effort to improve highway safety. Magnesium chloride is also sold in crystal form for household and business use to de-ice sidewalks and driveways. In these applications, the compound is applied after precipitation has fallen or ice has formed, instead of previously. Factors to consider for any anti-icer / de-icer product include (1) amount needed to be effective, (2) time needed to react and go into solution, (3) how long it will provide de-icing action (e.g., longer means fewer reapplications), (4) effectiveness of temperature range (magnesium chloride is 5 degrees F), and (5) environmental aspects such as residues, effects on plant life and effects on concrete. Purchasing and use decisions should be carefully considered since anti-icing and de-icing performance capabilities of common ice melting compounds vary significantly. The use of magnesium chloride seems to show an improvement in driving conditions during and after freezing precipitation, but it can (1) damage electric utilities in two ways: (a) by contamination of insulators, causing tracking and arcing across them, and (b) by corrosion of steel and aluminium poles and pole hardware and (2) it may accelerate damage to vehicle components through accelerated corrosion. [ Use in dust and erosion control ] Road departments and private industry may apply liquid or powdered magnesium chloride to control dust and erosion on unimproved (dirt or gravel) roads and dusty job sites such as quarries. Its hygroscopy makes it absorb moisture from the air, limiting the number of smaller particles (silts and clays) which become airborne. A small percentage of owners of indoor arenas (e.g. for horse riding) may apply magnesium chloride to sand or other &quot; footing &quot; materials to control dust. Although magnesium chloride use in an equestrian (horse) arena environment is generally referred to as a dust suppressant it is technically more accurate to consider it as a water augmentation activity since its performance is based on absorbing moisture from the air and from whatever else comes in contact with it. This hygoscopic action of magnesium chloride may present multiple negative characteristics in equestrian arena environments and should be carefully considered before implementing such a program. [ Use in hydrogen storage ] Magnesium chloride has shown promise as a storage material for hydrogen. Ammonia, which is rich in hydrogen atoms, is used as an intermediate storage material. Ammonia can be effectively absorbed onto solid magnesium chloride, forming Mg(NH 3 ) 6 Cl. Ammonia is released by mild heat, and is then passed through a catalyst to give hydrogen gas. [ Medical and veterinary use ] Magnesium chloride is a type of pharmaceutical preparation of magnesium. Medically-prescribed magnesium supplements such as Slo-Mag and Mag-SR contain magnesium chloride which is slowly released from a matrix. However, since magnesium is absorbed by the body in ionic form (after the salt dissolves in water) such supplements have no advantage over any soluble magnesium salt (for example, magnesium citrate or magnesium aspartate ). One veterinary study in 1989 indicated some effectiveness against tumors when magnesium chloride was used as a feed additive. { Veterinary Medical Research Institute, Iowa State University } [ Experimental antilipid effects in animals ] In a recent experiment with mice, MgCl 2 fortification of drinking water reduced cholesterol and triglyceride levels, although overall plasma lipid levels were similar at the beginning and the end of the study. { Atherogenesis inhibition induced by magnesium-chloride fortification of drinking water } [ Marine aquarium use ] Diagram showing concentrations of various salt ions in seawater: Note that the diagram is only correct in units of wt/wt, not wt/vol or vol/vol. Magnesium in natural seawater values are between 1250  mg/L and 1350  mg/L. (approximately 3.7% of the total seawater mineral content. See thumbnail chart.) Dead Sea minerals contain a significantly higher magnesium chloride ratio (50.8%). In seawater Magnesium helps to stabilize the correct combination of calcium, alkalinity, and pH values. Severely low values of magnesium (900  mg/L or below) can cause low pH values and an inability to maintain proper alkalinity and calcium values. If levels of magnesium become too low, coral growth ceases; decline of coral health follows. Carbonates and calcium are essential for all growth of corals, coralline algae, clams, and invertebrates. Maintaining the correct magnesium values is very important and is indirectly responsible for coral and coralline algae growth by making it possible to maintain correct calcium, alkalinity, and pH values. Magnesium can be depleted by mangrove plants and the use of excessive Kalkwasser or by going beyond natural calcium, alkalinity, and pH values. { http://www.advancedaquarist.com/issues/oct2003/chem.htm } [ Toxicology ] Magnesium ions are bitter-tasting, and magnesium chloride solutions are bitter in varying degrees, depending on the concentration of magnesium. Magnesium toxicity from magnesium salts is rare in healthy individuals with a normal diet, because excess magnesium is readily excreted in urine by the kidneys. A few cases of oral magnesium toxicity have been described in persons with normal renal function ingesting large amounts of magnesium salts, but it is rare. If a large amount of magnesium chloride is eaten, it will have effects similar to magnesium sulfate, causing diarrhea, although the sulfate also contributes to the laxative effect in magnesium sulfate, so the effect from the chloride is not as severe.
