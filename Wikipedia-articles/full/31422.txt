In loose form, it is the widely used substance known as talcum powder. It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses, its crystal s being so rare as to be almost unknown. It has a perfect basal cleavage, and the folia are non- elastic, although slightly flexible. It is the softest known mineral and listed as 1 on the Mohs hardness scale. It can be easily scratched by a fingernail. It is also sectile (can be cut with a knife). It has a specific gravity of 2.5–2.8, a clear or dusty luster, and is translucent to opaque. Talc is not soluble in water, but it is slightly soluble in dilute mineral acid s. Its colour ranges from white to grey or green and it has a distinctly greasy feel. Its streak is white. Soapstone is a metamorphic rock composed predominantly of talc. [ Formation ] A block of talc. Talc is a metamorphic mineral resulting from the metamorphism of magnesian minerals such as serpentine, pyroxene, amphibole, olivine, in the presence of carbon dioxide and water. This is known as talc carbonation or steatization and produces a suite of rocks known as talc carbonate s. Talc is primarily formed via hydration and carbonation via the following reaction; serpentine + carbon dioxide → talc + magnesite + water 2 Mg 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 + 3CO 2 → Mg 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2 + 3 MgCO 3 + 3 H 2 O Talc can also be formed via a reaction between dolomite and silica, which is typical of skarn ification of dolomites via silica-flooding in contact metamorphic aureoles; dolomite + silica + water → talc + calcite + carbon dioxide 3 CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 + 4 SiO 2 + H 2 O → Mg 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2 + 3 CaCO 3 + 3 CO 2 Talc can also be formed from magnesian chlorite and quartz in blueschist and eclogite metamorphism via the following metamorphic reaction : chlorite + quartz → kyanite + talc + water In this reaction, the ratio of talc and kyanite is dependent on aluminium content with more aluminous rocks favoring production of kyanite. This is typically associated with high-pressure, low-temperature minerals such as phengite, garnet, glaucophane within the lower blueschist facies. Such rocks are typically white, friable, and fibrous, and are known as whiteschist. Talc is a tri-octahedral layered mineral; its structure is similar to that of pyrophyllite, but with magnesium in the octahedral sites of the composite layers. [ Occurrence ] Talc output in 2005 Talc is a common metamorphic mineral in metamorphic belts which contain ultramafic rock s, such as soapstone (a high-talc rock), and within whiteschist and blueschist metamorphic terranes. Prime examples of whiteschists include the Franciscan Metamorphic Belt of the western United States, the western European Alps especially in Italy, certain areas of the Musgrave Block, and some collisional orogens such as the Himalayas which stretches along Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan. Talc carbonate ultramafics are typical of many areas of the Archaean craton s, notably the komatiite belts of the Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia. Talc-carbonate ultramafics are also known from the Lachlan Fold Belt, eastern Australia, from Brazil, the Guiana Shield, and from the ophiolite belts of Turkey, Oman and the Middle East. Notable economic talc occurrences include the Mount Seabrook talc mine, Western Australia, formed upon a polydeformed, layered ultramafic intrusion. The France-based Luzenac Group is the world&apos;s largest supplier of mined talc; its largest talc mine at Trimouns near Luzenac in southern France produces 400,000   tonne s of talc per year, representing 8% of world production. { Luzenac Group report (2006). p.3. } [ Uses ] Talcum powder. The structure of talc is composed of Si 2 O 5 sheets with magnesium sandwiched between sheets in octahedral sites. Talc is used in many industries such as paper making, plastic, paint and coatings, rubber, food, electric cable, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, ceramics, etc. A coarse grayish-green high-talc rock is soapstone or steatite and has been used for stoves, sinks, electrical switchboards, crayons, soap, etc. It is often used for surfaces of lab counter tops and electrical switchboards because of its resistance to heat, electricity and acids. Talc finds use as a cosmetic (talcum powder), as a lubricant, and as a filler in paper manufacture. Talc is used in baby powder, an astringent powder used for preventing rashes on the area covered by a diaper (see diaper rash ). It is also often used in basketball to keep a player&apos;s hands dry. Most tailor&apos;s chalk, or French chalk, is talc, as is the chalk often used for welding or metalworking. Talc is also used as food additive or in pharmaceutical products as a glidant. In medicine talc is used as a pleurodesis agent to prevent recurrent pleural effusion or pneumothorax. In the European Union the additive number is E553b. Talc is widely used in the ceramics industry in both bodies and glazes. In low-fire artware bodies it imparts whiteness and increases thermal expansion to resist crazing. In stonewares, small percentages of talc are used to flux the body and therefore improve strength and vitrification. It is a source of MgO flux in high temperature glazes (to control melting temperature). It is also employed as a matting agent in earthenware glazes and can be used to produce magnesia mattes at high temperatures.

Its production requirements are less energy-intensive than ordinary Portland cement at around 650 °C, while it absorbs far more carbon dioxide as it hardens. This results in a negative carbon footprint overall, as the cement substitute removes 0.6 tonnes of CO 2 per tonne used. This contrasts with a carbon footprint of 0.4 tonne per tonne of conventional cement. { Revealed: The cement that eats carbon dioxide Alok Jha, The Guardian, 31 December 2008 } Talc is sometimes used as an adulterant to illegal heroin, to expand volume and weight and thereby increase its street value. With intravenous use, it may lead to talcosis, a granulomatous inflammation in the lung s. [ Safety ] Talc powder is a household item, sold globally for use in personal hygiene and cosmetics and used by many millions every year. Some suspicions have been raised about the possibility its use promotes certain types of diseases, mainly cancers of the ovaries and lungs. This is not widely recognised as an established link. { Talcum powder and cancer, Cancerresearch.uk } { Talcum Powder and Cancer, American Cancer Society } The studies reference, by subject: pulmonary issues, [ 2198684 Pulmonary toxicity of inhaled and intravenous talc 1990 Hollinger MA 52 2 121–7; discussion 117–9 Toxicology letters 10.1016/0378-4274(90)90145-C ] lung cancer, [ 12616290 http://www.ntp.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid%3D0709BB4D-D4A2-78A0-F519C6ABAF22CDC1 NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Talc (Non-Asbestiform) in Rats and Mice (Inhalation Studies) 1993 National Toxicology Program 421 1–287 National Toxicology Program technical report series ] [ http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/Talc.html Health effects of mining and milling talc.
