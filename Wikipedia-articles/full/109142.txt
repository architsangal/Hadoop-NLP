By 1830, a Euro-American town called Alligator was established, adjacent to the Seminole town. The city was incorporated and changed to its current name in 1859. The name was changed because the mayor&apos;s wife, who had recently moved to the town, refused to hang her lace curtains in a town named Alligator.

The American Civil War Battle of Olustee took place near Lake City in February 1864. It was the only major battle in Florida during the war.

Lake City&apos;s started out as the Seminole community of Alligator Village (Hvlpvtv Tvlofv) in Spanish Florida. Historians don&apos;t know when it was established but its existence is documented by the U.S. army in 1821. Spanish Florida had long been a place of freedom for slaves escaping from the Bristish colonies and the United States. Also, many of the refugees from the Creek War moved to Spanish Florida to live among or near the Seminole in the aftermath of the Creek War, because they had been forced to surrender their land to the U.S.A. in the Treaty of Fort Jackson. In a February 1821 report by Captain John H. Bell, he mentions that the recent death of the micco (chief) of Alligator Village prevented the micco&apos;s attendance at a gathering of chiefs. After Florida became a territory of the United States in 1821, pioneer and immigrant settlers from the United States formed their own settlement adjacent to Alligator Village and called it Alligator Town. Then, following the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the residents of Alligator village relocated to the banks of Peace Creek in the newly established Seminole reservation, leaving Alligator Town on its own. When Columbia County was formed in 1832, Alligator Town became the seat of the county government. Alligator Town was renamed Lake City in 1859. The most famous resident of Alligator Village was Alligator Warrior (Hvlpvtv Tvstvnvke). He was a son of a daughter of Micanopy (King) Payne (Mekk-Onvpv Pin) and lead Seminole warriors in the 2nd Seminole War (1835–1842) to prevent the relocation of Florida&apos;s Indians to the Arkansas Territory (now known as Oklahoma). Although Alligator Warrior was certainly a leader of warriors, the U.S. military mistakenly referred to him as a chief because they did not understand Seminole culture. The Alligator Warrior Festival tries to educate and entertain by demonstrating how Native American, European, African and mixed-descent settlers lived in early 19th Century Florida. Living-history reenactors portraying 1830&apos;s Seminoles, U.S. soldiers, pioneer militia and settlers give presentations in their period camps and reenact the 18 September 1836, Battle of San Felasco Hammock, { s:Report of Colonel Warren, Fort Gilleland, September 18, 1836, to R. K. CALL, Governor of Florida Report of Colonel Warren regarding the Battle of San Felasco Hammock } which is the 2nd Seminole War battle that took place closest to O&apos;Leno State Park. The festival also includes Native American musicians and dancers, a drum arbor with dance ground and tee pee camp, as well as other musicians, demonstrators of early 19th Century skills such as blacksmithing, barrell making, spinning and weaving, and traders selling historic replicas, skillfully handcrafted arts, manufactured souvenirs, and food. { Alligator Festival web site } The first Alligator Festival was held in 1995 at Olustee Park in downtown Lake City. The event was not held from 2000 to 2001 while Olustee Park was being completely rebuilt. The renovated Olustee Park was no longer suitable for the event so it was held at Wilson Park from 2002 to 2003. Needing a larger space, it was held at Gateway College from 2003 to 2007. The organizational committee reorganized into a non-profit corporation in 2007. Then, for the city&apos;s sesquicentennial (150th) celebration in 2009, the event was held at the old memorial stadium because use of the college grounds became unaffordable. Starting in 2010 the annual festival is being held at O&apos;Leno State Park, in Columbia County, where the appropriate facilities exist for a full scale battle reenactment, historic camping and large crowds. { Alligator Fest web site } [ Other recreational facilities ] 1 Public outdoor Rifle and Pistol range, 9 Soccer Fields, 26 baseball/softball Fields, 7 Tennis Courts. 8 Raquet Ball Courts, 2 Golf Course, 4 Local Parks, 1 Public Swimming Pool, 1 YMCA, 1 Amateur Theatre, 3 State Parks, 2 Auto Racing Tracks [ Notable natives ] Jerome Carter - NFL safety Shayne Edge - former Florida Gators and Pittsburgh Steelers punter Bertram Nelson Herlong - Bishop, Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee Michael Kirkman - MLB Pitcher, World Series, Texas Rangers Martha Mier - pianist and Composer John Franklin Stewart - MLB, 2nd Base Pat Summerall - NFL placekicker, television sportscaster Jason Todd - former Shinedown guitarist Gerard Warren - NFL defensive tackle Reinard Wilson - NFL linebacker Chubby Wise - Famous Fiddler Fred P.
