[ http://www.bu.edu/alumni/bostonia/2001/fall/oreilly/index.html Bostonia - BU alumni quarterly 2001 ] A producer will research the story and book guests for O&apos;Reilly, and an information packet will be produced with possible angles for O&apos;Reilly to explore. The producers will often &quot; pre-interview &quot; the guest so that they know what potential points he or she might make. [ http://www.aim.org/aim_report/A214_0_4_0_C/ Accuracy in media report 2003 ] For each show, O&apos;Reilly, with the assistance of his staff, will produce a script with the words for the &quot; Talking Points Memo &quot; and &quot; Pinheads and Patriots &quot; segments, and points of discussion and questions for the guests that will appear on the program. On February 2, 2009 the show launched in high definition and moved to the previous studio used by the Fox Report. Radio talk show host Laura Ingraham is the current regular guest host, though Mike Huckabee, Juan Williams, Monica Crowley, Eric Bolling, and Greg Gutfeld have also filled in. [ Segments ] The show is divided into titled segments, appearing in the following general order. Not all segments appear in all programs, and occasionally segments will repeat. Talking Points Memo: O&apos;Reilly&apos;s commentary on a current event or the state of the country. Top Story: O&apos;Reilly covers one of the important news stories of the day, with interviews with newsmakers, noted analysts, or Fox News Channel reporters. If there is nothing breaking, the Top Story will often expand on the subject covered in the Talking Points Memo with a guest that either rebuts or concurs with the memo. Impact: O&apos;Reilly focuses on issues of crime and the law in this segment. Updates on criminal investigations, trials, and lawsuits are highlighted. Other times, issues relating to government relations and agencies are featured, as are stories about the Iraq War. Unresolved Problem: O&apos;Reilly focuses on an issue that he feels is not sufficiently covered by other media. Personal Story: O&apos;Reilly invites an author of a best selling book, a newsmaker thrust into the spotlight, someone who has experienced an event currently in the news, or someone who has interviewed a newsmaker. Factor Follow-Up: O&apos;Reilly revisits an issue discussed in a previous edition of the Factor. Back of the Book: Various topics will be placed in this segment, which is one of the last segments (hence the name). Two examples are &quot; Reality Check &quot; and the &quot; Great American Culture Quiz &quot;, in which O&apos;Reilly quizzes two Fox News colleagues (usually Steve Doocy and Martha MacCallum ) on pop culture. Factor Mail: O&apos;Reilly reads brief snippets of Email sent to him. He frequently puts together letters that have opposite viewpoints on a particular segment. For instance, one letter will say O&apos;Reilly was excessively lenient toward a guest while the next will say he was excessively hard on him. He will also frequently read out a short verse, usually a limerick. Pinheads and Patriots: A segment where O&apos;Reilly praises someone he feels has done good things for the country or the culture, while chastising someone else he feels is committing specific harm or has simply made some sort of embarrassing blunder. In an experimental version of the segment, during early 2011, O&apos;Reilly would roll a clip and the viewers would vote on whether the people in clip were &quot; Patriotic &quot; or &quot; Pinheaded &quot;; the new format was eventually scrapped and O&apos;Reilly returned to declaring his &quot; Pinheads &quot; and &quot; Patriots &quot; unilaterally. Word of the Day: When providing the email address for viewers to write, O&apos;Reilly will state that when writing, &quot; don&apos;t be (a) &quot; followed by a lesser-known word (thus challenging his viewers to discover the word&apos;s meaning). Occasionally, the following segments appear: Barack and a Hard Place: A weekly segment where the best and worst things that U.S. President Barack Obama has done during the week are talked about with Alan Colmes and Monica Crowley. Children at Risk: O&apos;Reilly covers issues relating to the health and well-being of children and adolescents. Charles in Charge: A regular segment where O&apos;Reilly seeks commentary from Charles Krauthammer about the week&apos;s political events. Culture War: This segment which O&apos;Reilly debates social issues that divide the country. Culture Warriors O&apos;Reilly talks to Margaret Hoover and Gretchen Carlson about various subjects. Did You See That?: Video clips are shown and discussed with Dagen McDowell. Dumbest Things of the Week: Friday segment where the dumbest things of the week are shown and discussed with Arthel Neville and Greg Gutfeld. Factor Investigation: O&apos;Reilly invites guests who have investigated a person or organization that O&apos;Reilly has criticized. Fridays with Geraldo: Geraldo Rivera, of the Fox News-produced and syndicated Geraldo At Large, discusses a topic of interest to O&apos;Reilly. Sometimes its own segment; other times rolled into one of the above segments. Kelly File: A segment where O&apos;Reilly talks to Megyn Kelly. Great American News Quiz: Trivia questions are answered by Steve Doocy and Martha MacCallum. The Ingraham Angle: A segment where O&apos;Reilly talks to Laura Ingraham. Is It Legal: Lis Wiehl and Kimberly Guilfoyle talk about legal matters. Miller Time: A Wednesday segment where O&apos;Reilly talks to Dennis Miller. Policing the...: A segment where O&apos;Reilly reviews several sources for normally outlandish content. The &quot; the &quot; in the name is usually followed up by &quot; net &quot; (Internet), or Media. The Most R!d!culous Item of the Day: Replaced by &quot; Pinheads &amp; Patriots, &quot; it was a brief segment highlighting an offbeat news item. Factor Flashback: Normally aired during episodes in which someone fills in for O&apos;Reilly; a replay of a previously aired segment. Weekdays with Bernie: A segment where Bernard Goldberg discusses topics with O&apos;Reilly (generally this segment will appear on Mondays). Lou&apos;s the Boss: Business and economic issues are discussed with Lou Dobbs Watters&apos; World: A segment that airs every two weeks on Monday, in which Factor producer Jesse Watters talks to the younger generation about a broad range of issues.

The show, hosted by Stephen Colbert, is a satirical spoof of pundit shows like The O&apos;Reilly Factor, spoofing its format and the mannerisms and ideology of O&apos;Reilly, whom Colbert calls &quot; Papa Bear. &quot; Colbert makes no secret of his spoofing O&apos;Reilly: upon hearing the news that O&apos;Reilly approved of The Colbert Report, he declared on-air that &quot; I like you too.

Later in &quot; Return of the King &quot;, O&apos;Reilly is shown attacking Martin Luther King for saying that America should &quot; love thy enemy &quot; and &quot; turn the other cheek &quot;, even in respects to the 9/11 attacks. O&apos;Reilly accuses him of hating America and tells him to &quot; Take another 40 year nap, Commie bastard. &quot; The Political Machine features a skit called &quot; The O&apos;Malley Scenario &quot; ( &quot; A show you appear on while running for president &quot; ). In Arrested Development, the failed Bluth company frequently features on The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day segment. CNNNN, an Australian comedy show which satirized cable news, featured a recurring segment entitled The Firth Factor. These segments typically showed Charles Firth, a member of the Chaser comedy team, presenting his opinion on topical issues, often through use of over-the-top comparisons (such as dipping a paper heart in a can of black paint and claiming: &quot; This is how black Saddam Hussein &apos;s heart is &quot; ) and outrageous statements in a parody of O&apos;Reilly and Australian current affairs personalities. The Chaser&apos;s War on Everything also featured a segment in its second season where it poked fun at the O&apos;Reilly factor. In 2008 Talkshow with Spike Feresten has begun parodying O&apos;Reilly with a series of videos entitled &quot; Lil Bill O&apos;Reilly &quot;, using a child as O&apos;Reilly.
