[ 6 ] The city is the fifth-oldest European city in the state of South Carolina. The population of the city was 13,964 as of the 2010 census [ 2 ] (though the greater city population was 67,326). The city is located 37 miles southeast of Columbia, on the north fork of the Edisto River in the Piedmont area. In May 2000, the city created the Orangeburg County Community of Character initiative. It is a collaborative effort in community development by the Downtown Orangeburg Revitalization Association (DORA), The Times and Democrat newspaper, the Orangeburg County Chamber of Commerce, and the Orangeburg County Development Commission. In 2005, the National Civic League awarded Orangeburg County the coveted All-America City Award (which can also be awarded to a county), which recognizes and encourages civic excellence. It honors communities in which citizens, government, businesses, and non-profit organizations demonstrate successful resolution of critical community issues. In 2007, Orangeburg hosted the first Democratic U.S. presidential candidate debate of the campaign season at Martin Luther King Jr. Auditorium on the campus of South Carolina State University. [ History ] Orangeburg, named for William IV, Prince of Orange, the son-in-law of King George II, of England, was first settled by Europeans in 1704 when the Indian trader, George Sterling, set up a post there. To encourage settlement, the General Assembly of the Province of South Carolina in 1730 made the area into a township in the shape of a parallelogram 15 x [ 5 mi km ]. In 1735, a colony of 200 Swiss, German and Dutch immigrants formed a community near the banks of the North Edisto River. The site was attractive because of the fertile soil and the abundance of wildlife. The river provided an outlet to the port of Charleston for the area&apos;s agriculture and lumber products. The town soon became a well-established and successful colony, composed chiefly of small yeomen farmers. The church played an important role in the early life of Orangeburg. The first church was established by a German Lutheran congregation. It later identified as an Anglican Church, which was the established church and exempt from colonial taxation. The church building was erected prior to 1763 in the center of the village and was destroyed during the Revolutionary War. A subsequent church building was used as a smallpox hospital by General William Tecumseh Sherman during the Civil War. In the nineteenth century, settlers developed the county as large-scale cotton plantations following the invention of the cotton gin, which enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton. Major planters transported black slaves from coastal areas to work as laborers; others were brought into the area for sale by slave traders from the Upper South. Slaves comprised most of the labor through the plantation era. African Americans form a majority in the city and county. The center of the original village was near what is now Broughton and Henley Streets, according to a marker there. In the 1960s, Orangeburg was a major center of Civil Rights Movement activities involving students from both Claflin College and South Carolina State College and residents of Orangeburg&apos;s Black community. When whites used economic retaliation local Blacks seeking school integration in 1956 after the US Supreme Court ruling declaring segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, students came to their support with hunger strikes, boycotts, and mass marches. In 1960, over 400 students were arrested on sit-ins and integration marches organized by CORE. In August 1963, the Orangeburg Freedom Movement (OFM), chaired by Dr. Harlowe Caldwell of the NAACP, submitted 10 pro-integration demands to the Orangeburg Mayor and City Council. After negotiations failed, mass demonstrations similar to those in the Birmingham campaign resulted in more than 1,300 arrests. On February 8, 1968, after days of protests against a segregated bowling alley, violence broke out near the bowling alley between police and Black students from South Carolina State. Police opened fire on a crowd of students, killing Samuel Hammond, Henry Smith, and Delano Middleton, and wounding 27 others in what became known as the &quot; Orangeburg Massacre &quot;. { &quot; History &amp; Timeline &quot;, Civil Rights Movement Veterans } [ Geography ] Orangeburg is located at [ 33 29 49 N 80 51 44 W type:city ] (33.496843, -80.862206) [ 1 ].
