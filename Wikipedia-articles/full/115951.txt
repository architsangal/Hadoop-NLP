In 1752, the land was surveyed and divided into [ 30 acre m2 on ] lots, although some soldiers sold their rights for whatever they could get. Those that did settle found their cabins razed by Indians trying to drive them away. In response, the veterans built at Standish Corner a stockade d fort, which provided protection until Indian hostilities ceased in 1759 with the Fall of Quebec. Pearsontown Plantation was incorporated as Standish on November 30, 1785. [ Maine League of Historical Societies and Museums Doris A.
