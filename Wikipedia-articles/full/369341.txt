Wilson&apos;s decision to call an election turned on the fact that his government, elected a mere 17 months previously in 1964 had an unworkably small majority of only 4 MPs. Wilson&apos;s hope that he would be returned to office with a larger majority had been encouraged by the government&apos;s victory in a by-election in Kingston upon Hull North. In the end the hope was vindicated: the Labour government was returned with a much larger majority of 96. { The BBC lists this result as 363 seats, which would give a majority of 96, due to the speaker&apos;s seat being listed as &quot; other &quot;, which is ironic as the BBC tends to include the speaker in the party totals. 364 seats would naturally result in a majority of 98. } Prior to the general election, in 1965, Labour had actually performed poorly in local elections, and lost at a crucial by-election, cutting their majority to just 2. Labour ran its campaign with the slogan &quot; You know Labour government works &quot;. Shortly after the local elections, Sir Alec Douglas-Home was replaced with Edward Heath, as leader of the Conservative party. The Conservative campaign, although more professional than previously, had not really had time to prepare, and with Heath only having just settled in the year before, there had been little time for him to become well known among the British public. As for the Liberals money was an issue, 2 elections in the space of just 2 years had left the party in a tight financial position. { 1966: Wilson gains mandate BBC News } The election night was broadcast live on the BBC, and was presented by Cliff Michelmore, Robin Day, Robert McKenzie and David Butler.
