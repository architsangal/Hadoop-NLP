As of the 2010 census recorded its population to be 840,978, making it the third most populous county in the state. { www.census.gov } Of Michigan&apos;s five largest counties, Macomb experienced the most population growth (6.7%) between 2000 and 2010. The county seat is Mt. Clemens. [ 6 ] Macomb County is part of the Detroit metropolitan area; the city of Detroit is located south of 8 Mile Road, the county&apos;s southern border. Macomb County contains 28 cities, townships and villages, including three of the top ten most populous municipalities in Michigan as of the 2010 census: Warren (#3), Sterling Heights (#4) and Clinton Township (#10). { US Census Bureau Population Estimates, census.gov, retrieved 2010-Jun-22 } Most of this population is concentrated south of Hall Road, one of the county&apos;s main thoroughfares. The county is named for Alexander Macomb, Jr., an early U.S. Army commander. [ February 2012 ] [ History ] The Ojibwa lived in the area centuries before European contact. The first European explorers arrived in the area during the 17th century. A Moravian colony was established in the county in the late 18th century. They included French fur trappers and missionaries. In addition to the original French and English, later settlers included German s, Belgian s and others who came directly from Europe. In the 19th century the county received many American migrants from New York and New England who were attracted to the area for land and booming jobs. [ February 2012 ] Macomb County was formally organized on January 15, 1818 as the third county in the Michigan territory. At that time, it covered a much larger area than it does today. In 1819 and 1820, large portions of the county were removed to form the counties of Oakland, Lapeer, Genesee and St. Clair. The county was named in honor of General Alexander Macomb, a highly decorated veteran of the War of 1812. [ February 2012 ] The county gained fame in the 1980s and &apos;90s as a bellwether of state and national politics. Macomb&apos;s large cohort of working-class, socially conservative whites gave it one of the nation&apos;s most prominent concentrations of &quot; Reagan Democrat s &quot;. Outsider candidates with a conservative- populist bent have done well there in the past (e.g. George Wallace in 1968 and Pat Buchanan in 1992). [ February 2012 ] In May 2008, Macomb County voters approved the inclusion of a County Executive in a new charter to be submitted to the voters by 2010. A charter commission was elected in November 2008 for the purpose of drafting a charter for submission to Governor Granholm, which was submitted and approved and placed on the November 2009 ballot. The Charter passed with a 60.4% to 39.6% margin. { http://www.newsroomsolutions.com/m4/112.html } [ February 2012 self source ] [ Geography ] According to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of [ 569.78 sqmi ], of which [ 480.44 sqmi ] (or 84.32%) is land and [ 89.34 sqmi ] (or 15.68%) is water.
