Edgar Hoover in 1924 } John Edgar Hoover (January 1, 1895 – May 2, 1972) was the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States. Appointed director of the Bureau of Investigation—predecessor to the FBI—in 1924, he was instrumental in founding the FBI in 1935, where he remained director until his death in 1972 aged 77. Hoover is credited with building the FBI into a large and efficient crime-fighting agency, and with instituting a number of modernizations to police technology, such as a centralized fingerprint file and forensic laboratories. Late in life and after his death Hoover became a controversial figure as evidence of his secretive actions became public. His critics have accused him of exceeding the jurisdiction of the FBI.

[ Early life and education ] J. Edgar Hoover was born on New Year&apos;s Day 1895 in Washington, D.C., to Anna Marie (née Scheitlin; 1860–1938), who was of German Swiss descent, and Dick Naylor Hoover, Sr. (1856–1921), of English and German ancestry. The uncle of Hoover&apos;s mother was a Swiss honorary consul general to the United States. Hoover grew up near the Eastern Market in Washington&apos;s Capitol Hill neighborhood. At Central High, he sang in the school choir, participated in the Reserve Officers&apos; Training Corps program, and competed on the debate team, [ Cox, John Stuart and Theoharis, Athan G. 1988 The Boss: J. Edgar Hoover and the Great American Inquisition Temple University Press 0-87722-532-X ] where he argued against women getting the vote and against abolition of the death penalty. { The Guardian, The secret life of J Edgar Hoover } He obtained a law degree from George Washington University Law School in 1916, and an LL.M., a Master of Laws degree, in 1917 from the same university.

Edgar Hoover&apos;s GW Years GW Today GWU ] {. } [ http://alumni.gwu.edu/prominent/classyear/1880s30s.html GWU Alumni Prominent ] {. } While a law student, Hoover became interested in the career of Anthony Comstock, the New York City United States Postal Inspector, who waged prolonged campaigns against fraud and vice, and also was against pornography and birth control. [ FBI career ] During World War I, immediately after getting his LLM, Hoover was hired by the Justice Department. He was soon promoted to head of the Enemy Aliens Registration Section. In August 1919, he became head of the new General Intelligence Division of the Bureau of Investigation within the Justice Department [ Red Scare: A Study in National Hysteria, 1919–1920 Murray Robert K 1955 University of Minnesota Press Minneapolis 0-8166-5833-1 193 ] {. } (see the Palmer Raids ). Hoover joined the Bureau as America&apos;s first great Communist scare was getting under way, and handpicked as his assistant a man named George Ruch. One of two key associates to name their own sons J Edgar, Ruch expressed astonishment that left-wingers should even &quot; be allowed to speak and write as they like &quot;. { The Guardian, The secret life of J Edgar Hoover } Hoover and Ruch favoured deporting people merely for being members of radical organisations, and used the Bureau to spy on lawyers representing those arrested in the Red Raids of 1920. One of them, on whom Hoover was to keep tabs for half a century and deem &quot; the most dangerous man in the United States &quot;, was future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter. { The Guardian, The secret life of J Edgar Hoover } In 1921, he rose in the Bureau of Investigation to deputy head, and in 1924, the Attorney General made him the acting director. On May 10, 1924, President Calvin Coolidge appointed Hoover as the sixth director of the Bureau of Investigation, following President Warren Harding &apos;s death and in response to allegations that the prior director, William J. Burns, was involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. When Hoover took over the Bureau of Investigation, it had approximately 650 employees, including 441 Special Agents. Hoover was noted as sometimes being capricious in his leadership; he frequently fired FBI agents, singling out those who he thought &quot; looked stupid like truck drivers &quot; or he considered to be &quot; pinheads &quot;. [ Schott Joseph L No Left Turns: The FBI in Peace &amp; War Praeger 1975 0-275-33630-1 ] [ yes 2012 February 2012 ] He also relocated agents who had displeased him to career-ending assignments and locations. Melvin Purvis was a prime example; he was one of the most effective agents in capturing and breaking up 1930s gangs and received substantial public recognition, but a jealous Hoover maneuvered him out of the FBI. [ Purvis Alston Tresinowski Alex The Vendetta: FBI Hero Melvin Purvis&apos;s War Against Crime and J. Edgar Hoover&apos;s War Against Him Public Affairs 2005 183+ 1-58648-301-3 ] Hoover often hailed local law-enforcement officers around the country and built up a national network of supporters and admirers in the process. One that he often commended was the conservative sheriff of Caddo Parish, Louisiana, J. Howell Flournoy, for particular effectiveness. { &quot; Sheriff 26 Years – J. H. Flournoy Dies, &quot; Shreveport Journal, December 14, 1966, p. 1 } [ Gangster wars ] { Depression Era gangsters, including } { Pretty Boy Floyd, } { Baby Face Nelson, } { Machine Gun Kelly, and more (1920s). } In the early 1930s, criminal gangs carried out large numbers of bank robberies in the Midwest. They used their superior firepower and fast getaway cars to elude local law enforcement agencies and avoid arrest. Many of these criminals, particularly John Dillinger, who became famous for leaping over bank cages and repeatedly escaping from jails and police traps, frequently made newspaper headlines across the United States. Since the robbers operated across state lines, their crimes became federal offenses, giving Hoover and his men the authority to pursue them. Initially, the FBI suffered some embarrassing foul-ups, in particular with Dillinger and his conspirators. A raid on a summer lodge named &quot; Little Bohemia &quot; in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, left an FBI agent and a civilian bystander dead, and others wounded. All the gangsters escaped. Hoover realized that his job was now on the line, and he pulled out all stops to capture the culprits. In late July 1934, Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the Director of Operations in the Chicago office, received a tip on Dillinger&apos;s whereabouts which paid off when Dillinger was located, ambushed and killed by FBI agents outside the Biograph Theater. In the same period, there were numerous Mafia shootings as a result of Prohibition, while Hoover continued to deny the very existence of organized crime. { Sifakis, Carl. The Mafia Encyclopedia (New York: Facts on File, 1999), p.127. } Frank Costello helped encourage this view by feeding Hoover, &quot; an inveterate horseplayer &quot; known to send Special Agents to place $100 bets for him, { Sifakis, p.127. } tips on sure winners through their mutual friend, gossip columnist Walter Winchell. Hoover said the Bureau had &quot; much more important functions &quot; than arresting bookmakers and gamblers. Even though he was not there, Hoover was credited with several highly publicized captures or shootings of outlaws and bank robbers. These included that of Dillinger, Alvin Karpis, and Machine Gun Kelly, which led to the Bureau&apos;s powers being broadened and it was given its new name in 1935: the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1939, the FBI became pre-eminent in the field of domestic intelligence. Hoover made changes, such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the Identification Division to compile the largest collection of fingerprints to date.

Hoover was concerned about subversion, and under his leadership, the FBI spied upon tens of thousands of suspected subversives and radicals. According to critics, Hoover tended to exaggerate the dangers of these alleged subversives and many times overstepped his bounds in his pursuit of eliminating that perceived threat. { See, for example, } [ Cox, John Stuart and Theoharis, Athan G. 1988 The Boss: J. Edgar Hoover and the Great American Inquisition Temple University Press 0-87722-532-X ] The FBI investigated rings of German saboteurs and spies starting in the late 1930s, and had primary responsibility for counterespionage. The first arrests of German agents were made in 1938, and continued throughout World War II. { William Breuer, Hitler&apos;s Undercover War, New York: St. Matin&apos;s Press, 1989, ISBN 0-312-02620-X. } In the Quirin affair during World War II, German U-boat s set two small groups of Nazi agents ashore in Florida and Long Island to cause acts of sabotage within the country. The two teams were apprehended after one of the men contacted the FBI, and told them everything. He was also charged and convicted.

It was not initially realized that espionage was being committed, but due to multiple wartime Soviet use of one-time pad ciphers, which are normally unbreakable, redundancies were created, enabling some intercepts to be decoded, which established the espionage. Hoover kept the intercepts—America&apos;s greatest counterintelligence secret—in a locked safe in his office, choosing not to inform President Truman, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath, or two Secretaries of State— Dean Acheson and General George Marshall —while they held office. He informed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the Venona Project in 1952. In 1946, U.S. Attorney General Tom C. Clark authorized Hoover to compile a list of potentially disloyal Americans who might be detained during a wartime national emergency. In 1950, at the outbreak of the Korean War, Hoover submitted to President Truman a plan to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and detain 12,000 Americans suspected of disloyalty. Truman did not act on the plan.

At this time he formalized a covert &quot; dirty tricks &quot; program under the name COINTELPRO. [ Cox, John Stuart and Theoharis, Athan G. 1988 The Boss: J. Edgar Hoover and the Great American Inquisition Temple University Press 312 0-87722-532-X ] This program remained in place until it was revealed to the public in 1971, after the theft of many internal documents stolen from an office in Media, Pennsylvania, and was the cause of some of the harshest criticism of Hoover and the FBI. COINTELPRO was first used to disrupt the Communist Party, where Hoover went after targets that ranged from suspected everyday spies to larger celebrity figures such as Charlie Chaplin who were seen as spreading Communist Party propaganda, [ Sbardellati John Tony Shaw Booting a Tramp: Charlie Chaplin, the FBI, and the Construction of the Subversive Image in Red Scare America ] and later organizations such as the Black Panther Party, Martin Luther King, Jr. &apos;s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and others. Its methods included infiltration, burglaries, illegal wiretaps, planting forged documents and spreading false rumors about key members of target organizations. [ Kessler Ronald Ronald Kessler The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI St. Martin&apos;s Paperbacks 2002 107, 174, 184, 215 0-312-98977-6 ] Some authors have charged that COINTELPRO methods also included inciting violence and arranging murders. { See for example } [ James Joy States of Confinement: Policing, Detention, and Prisons Palgrave Macmillan 2000 335 0-312-21777-3 ] {, } [ Williams Kristian Our Enemies In Blue: Police And Power In America Soft Skull Press 2004 183 1-887128-85-9 ] { and } [ Churchill, Ward and Wall, Jim Vander Agents of Repression: The FBI&apos;s Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement South End Press 2001 53+ 0-89608-646-1 ] In 1975, the activities of COINTELPRO were investigated by the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, called the Church Committee after its chairman, Senator Frank Church ( D - Idaho ), and these activities were declared illegal and contrary to the Constitution. [ Intelligence Activities And The Rights Of Americans 1976 http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIa.htm October 25, 2006 ] Hoover amassed significant power by collecting files containing large amounts of compromising and potentially embarrassing information on many powerful people, especially politicians. According to Laurence Silberman, appointed Deputy Attorney General in early 1974, FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley thought such files either did not exist or had been destroyed. After The Washington Post broke a story in January 1975, Kelley searched and found them in his outer office. The House Judiciary Committee then demanded that Silberman testify about them. In 1956, several years before he targeted King, Hoover had a public showdown with T.R.M. Howard, a civil rights leader from Mound Bayou, Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard had criticized the FBI&apos;s failure to thoroughly investigate the racially motivated murders of George W. Lee, Lamar Smith, and Emmett Till. Hoover wrote an open letter to the press singling out these statements as &quot; irresponsible. &quot; [ Response to Mafia and civil rights groups ] In the 1950s, evidence of Hoover&apos;s unwillingness to focus FBI resources on the Mafia became grist for the media and his many detractors. His moves against people who maintained contacts with subversive elements, some of whom were members of the civil rights movement, also led to accusations of trying to undermine their reputations. The treatment of Martin Luther King, Jr. and actress Jean Seberg are two examples. Jacqueline Kennedy recalled that Hoover told President John F. Kennedy that King tried to arrange a sex party while in the capital for the March on Washington and told Robert Kennedy that King made derogatory comments during the President&apos;s funeral.

Kennedy. In 1964, just days before Hoover testified in the earliest stages of the Warren Commission hearings, President Lyndon B. Johnson waived the then-mandatory U.S. Government Service Retirement Age of seventy, allowing Hoover to remain the FBI Director &quot; for life. &quot; The House Select Committee on Assassinations issued a report in 1979 critical of the performance by the FBI, the Warren Commission, and other agencies. The report also criticized what it characterized as the FBI&apos;s reluctance to thoroughly investigate the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.

Hoover personally made sure that Warner Bros. would portray the FBI more favorably than other crime dramas of the times. In 1979, there was a large increase in conflict in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) under Senator Richard Schweiker, which had re-opened the investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy, reported that Hoover&apos;s FBI &quot; failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President &quot;.

Johnson attacked the notion of Hoover&apos;s homosexuality for relying on &quot; the kind of tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected – guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip. &quot; He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose &quot; description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible is clearly a homophobic fantasy. &quot; He believes only those who have forgotten the virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government can believe reports that Hoover would allow himself to be seen in compromising situations. { David K Johnson, The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government (University of Chicago Press, 2004), 11–13 } Some people affiliated with Hoover, however, defended the claims that he had homosexual tendencies.

Edgar Hoover: Gay or Just a Man Who Has Sex With Men? 2 ] Another FBI agent who had gone on fishing trips with Hoover and Tolson revealed that the director liked to &quot; sunbathe all day in the nude. &quot; Hoover often frequented New York City&apos;s Stork Club and one observer – soap model Luisa Stuart, who was 18 or 19 at the time – told Summers she saw Hoover holding hands with Tolson as they all rode in a limo uptown to the Cotton Club in 1936. Novelist William Styron told Summers that he once spotted Hoover and Tolson in a California beach house and the director was painting his friend&apos;s toenails. Harry Hay, founder of the Mattachine Society, one of the first gay rights organizations, confirmed that Hoover and Tolson sat in boxes owned by and used exclusively by gay men at their racing haunt Del Mar in California. One medical expert told Summers that Hoover was of &quot; strongly predominant homosexual orientation &quot;, while another medical expert categorized him as a &quot; bisexual with failed heterosexuality. &quot; [ Freemasonry ] Hoover was a devoted Freemason, being raised a Master Mason on 9  November 1920, in Federal Lodge No.  1, Washington, DC, just two months before his 26th birthday.

Edgar Hoover room exists within the House of the Temple. The room contains many of Hoover&apos;s personal papers and records.
