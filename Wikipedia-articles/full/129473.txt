The population was 5,676 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Weirton – Steubenville, WV -OH Metropolitan Statistical Area. Toronto is known as the &quot; Gem City &quot;. [ History ] The area was first settled in the 19th century, when it was known as Newburg&apos;s Landing. When the railway was built, however, the area&apos;s name was changed to Sloanes Station. In 1881, after a vote, the town was incorporated under its present name. This was taken from the much larger Canadian city of the same name, which civic leader Thomas M. Daniels felt was a place worth emulating. In the 20th century, the town became a center of heavy industry with a number of large factories in and around the town. In the 1980s and 1990s the city, along with the rest of the region, declined sharply as manufacturing jobs left. Today the only major employer is the Titanium Metals Corporation, and it is employing fewer and fewer workers each year.
