{ birthplace in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. } { alt=A sculpture in the form of an open book. The text of the poem &quot; In Flanders Fields &quot; is written within and a small red poppy lays on top. } &quot; In Flanders Fields &quot; is a war poem in the form of a rondeau, written during the First World War by Canadian physician and Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae. He was inspired to write it on May 3, 1915, after presiding over the funeral of friend and fellow soldier Alexis Helmer, who died in the Second Battle of Ypres. According to legend, fellow soldiers retrieved the poem after McCrae, initially unsatisfied with his work, discarded it. &quot; In Flanders Fields &quot; was first published on December 8 of that year in the London -based magazine Punch. It is one of the most popular and most quoted poems from the war. As a result of its immediate popularity, parts of the poem were used in propaganda efforts and appeals to recruit soldiers and raise money selling war bond s. Its references to the red poppies that grew over the graves of fallen soldiers resulted in the remembrance poppy becoming one of the world&apos;s most recognized memorial symbols for soldiers who have died in conflict. The poem and poppy are prominent Remembrance Day symbols throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly in Canada, where &quot; In Flanders Fields &quot; is one of the nation&apos;s best known literary works. [ Background ] alt=Upper body of a man in a soldier&apos;s uniform. He has short dark hair parted in the middle and maintains a neutral expression. John McCrae was a poet and physician from Guelph, Ontario. He developed an interest in poetry at a young age and wrote throughout his life. [ Prescott 1985 11 ] His earliest works were published in the mid 1890s in Canadian magazines and newspapers. [ http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/history/firstwar/mccrae/earlyyears The early years Veterans Affairs Canada 2012-02-06 ] McCrae&apos;s poetry often focused on death and the peace that followed. [ Prescott 1985 21 ] At the age of 41, McCrae enrolled with the Canadian Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of the First World War. He had the option of joining the medical corps due to his training and age, but volunteered instead to join a fighting unit as a gunner and medical officer. [ Gillmour 2001 91–92 ] It was his second tour of duty in the Canadian military. He previously fought with a volunteer force in the Second Boer War. [ Prescott 1985 31 ] He considered himself a soldier first; his father was a military leader in Guelph and McCrae grew up believing in the duty of fighting for his country and empire. [ Bassett 1984 14 ] McCrae fought in the second battle of Ypres in the Flanders region of Belgium where the German army launched one of the first chemical attacks in the history of war. They attacked the Canadian position with chlorine gas on April 22, 1915, but were unable to break through the Canadian line which held for over two weeks. In a letter written to his mother, McCrae described the battle as a &quot; nightmare &quot; : &quot; For seventeen days and seventeen nights none of us have had our clothes off, nor our boots even, except occasionally. In all that time while I was awake, gunfire and rifle fire never ceased for sixty seconds..... And behind it all was the constant background of the sights of the dead, the wounded, the maimed, and a terrible anxiety lest the line should give way. &quot; [ http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/history/firstwar/mccrae/flanders In Flanders Fields Veterans Affairs Canada 2012-02-06 ] Alexis Helmer, a close friend, was killed during the battle on May 2. McCrae performed the burial service himself, at which time he noted how poppies quickly grew around the graves of those who died at Ypres. The next day, he composed the poem while sitting in the back of an ambulance. [ Gillmour 2001 93 ] [ Poem ] alt=The poem hand-written by McCrae. In this copy, the first line ends with &quot; grow &quot;, differing from the original published version. The first chapter of In Flanders Fields and Other Poems, a 1919 collection of McCrae&apos;s works, gives the text of the poem as follows: In Flanders fields the poppies blow { Between the crosses, row on row, } { That mark our place; and in the sky } { The larks, still bravely singing, fly } Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days agoWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, { Loved and were loved, and now we lie, } { In Flanders fields. } Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throw { The torch; be yours to hold it high. } { If ye break faith with us who die } We shall not sleep, though poppies grow { In Flanders fields. } As with his earlier poems, &quot; In Flanders Fields &quot; continued McCrae&apos;s preoccupation with death and how it stood as the transition between the struggle of life and the peace that followed. [ Prescott 1985 106 ] It was written from the point of view of the dead. It spoke of their sacrifice and served as their command to the living to press on. Historian Paul Fussell criticized the poem in his work The Great War and Modern Memory (1975). [ Fussell 2009 315 ] He noted the distinction between the pastoral tone of the first nine lines and the &quot; recruiting-poster rhetoric &quot; of the third stanza. Describing it as &quot; vicious &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot;, Fussell called the final lines a &quot; propaganda argument against a negotiated peace &quot;. [ Fussell 2009 314–315 ] As with many of the most popular works of the First World War, it was written early in the conflict, before the romanticism of war turned to bitterness and disillusion for soldiers and civilians alike. [ Publication ] alt=A page from a book. The first stanza of the poem is printed above an illustration of a white cross amidst a field of red poppies while two cannons fire in the background. Cyril Allinson was a sergeant major in McCrae&apos;s unit. While delivering the brigade&apos;s mail, he watched McCrae as he worked on the poem, noting that McCrae&apos;s eyes periodically returned to Helmer&apos;s grave as he wrote. When handed the notepad, Allinson read the poem and was so moved he immediately committed it to memory. He described it as being &quot; almost an exact description of the scene in front of us both &quot;.

It is said he crumpled the paper and threw it away. [ http://news.google.com/newspapers?id%3Dsc4kAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3D-Q8GAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3D816%2C694462 Forever there... In Flanders Fields The Journal Opinion 2006-03-29 2012-02-07 8 ] It was retrieved by a fellow member of his unit, either Edward Morrison or J. M. Elder, [ http://www.army.gov.au/traditions/documents/inflandersfield_1.htm The Red Poppy The Australian Army 2012-02-07 ] or Allinson himself. McCrae was convinced to submit the poem for publication. [ Prescott 1985 96 ] Another story of the poem&apos;s origin claimed that Helmer&apos;s funeral was actually held on the morning of May 2 after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes. A third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between the times wounded arrived for medical attention. [ Prescott 1985 95–96 ] Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication. [ Gillmour 2001 94 ] He submitted it to The Spectator in London, but it was rejected. It was then sent to Punch, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, though Punch attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index. [ Prescott 1985 105 ] The word that ends the first line of the poem has been disputed. According to Allinson, the poem began with &quot; In Flanders Fields the poppies grow &quot; when first written. However, since McCrae ended a later line with the same word, Punch received permission to change the wording of the opening line to end with &quot; blow &quot;. McCrae himself used either word when making handwritten copies for friends and family.

Most recently, the Royal Canadian Mint was inundated with queries and complaints from those who believed the first line should end with &quot; grow &quot; when a design for the ten-dollar bill was released in 2001 that featured the first stanza of &quot; In Flanders Fields &quot;, ending the first line with &quot; blow &quot;.

[ Bassett 1984 50 ] Its appeal was nearly universal. Soldiers took encouragement from it as a statement of their duty to those who died while people on the home front viewed it as defining the cause for which their brothers and sons were fighting. [ Bassett 1984 49 ] It was often used for propaganda, particularly in Canada by the Unionist Party during the 1917 federal election amidst the Conscription Crisis. French Canadian s in Quebec were strongly opposed to the possibility of conscription, but English Canadian s voted overwhelmingly to support Prime Minister Robert Borden and the Unionist government. &quot; In Flanders Fields &quot; was said to have done more to &quot; make this Dominion persevere in the duty of fighting for the world&apos;s ultimate peace than all the political speeches of the recent campaign &quot;. [ Prescott 1985 125 ] McCrae, a staunch supporter of the empire and the war effort, was pleased with the impact his poem had in the election. In a letter, he stated: &quot; I hope I stabbed a [French] Canadian with my vote. &quot; The poem was a popular motivational tool in Great Britain, where it was used to encourage soldiers fighting against Germany, and in the United States where it was reprinted across the country. It was one of the most quoted works during the war, [ Prescott 1985 105–106 ] used in many places as part of campaigns to sell war bond s, during recruiting efforts and to criticize pacifists and those who sought to profit from the war. [ Prescott 1985 133 ] American composer Charles Ives used &quot; In Flanders Fields &quot; as the basis for a song of the same name that premiered in 1917.

[ Prescott 1985 101 ] He was promoted to the acting rank of Colonel on January 13, 1918, and named Consulting Physician to the British Armies in France. The years of war had worn McCrae down, however. He contracted pneumonia that same day, and later came down with cerebral meningitis. On January 28, he died at the military hospital in Wimereux and was buried there with full military honours.

The poem is sometimes viewed as an anachronism; It spoke of glory and honour in a war that has since become synonymous with the futility of trench warfare and the wholesale slaughter produced by 20th century weaponry. Nancy Holmes, professor at the University of British Columbia, speculated that its patriotic nature and usage as a tool for propaganda may have led literary critics to view it as a national symbol or anthem rather than a poem.

A co-founder of The Royal British Legion, Haig supported and encouraged the sale. The practice quickly spread throughout the British Empire. The wearing of poppies in the days leading up to Remembrance Day remains popular in many areas of the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
