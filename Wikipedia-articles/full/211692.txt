She was named after a mountain in Wakayama Prefecture. The ships of this class displaced [ 13300 LT t on ], were [ 201 m ft on ] long and capable of [ 36 kn km/h mph in on ]. They carried two floatplane s, their main armament was ten [ 203 mm in on ] guns in five twin turret s. This was the heaviest armament of any cruiser class in the world, at the time they were built. [ Service history ] Nachi was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal on 26  November 1924, launched and named on 15  June 1927, and was commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 26  November 1928. Her service in World War II started in the Dutch East Indies, where she engaged the enemy off Makassar on 8  February 1942. She played a key role in the Battle of the Java Sea on 27  February, and was involved in the sinking of [ Exeter 68 6 ] and [ Encounter H10 2 ] in another action off south Borneo on 1  March. Nachi then moved to the Aleutian Islands where she was engaged in the diversionary attack on the islands on 3 June; she was back in the Aleutians when she was damaged on 26  March 1943 in the battle of the Komandorski Islands, and was engaged in an action at Kiska in July 1943. By October 1944, she was in the Philippines and took part in the Leyte Campaign, as part of a cruiser force under the command of Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima. Nachi was damaged in the Battle of Surigao Strait on 25  October 1944 after a collision with Mogami. [ Fate ] Nachi was in Manila Bay on 5 November 1944 when she was attacked by three waves of US planes from the aircraft carrier s [ Lexington CV-16 6 ] and [ Ticonderoga CV-14 2 ] of Task Force 38. In the engagement, Nachi was hit at least nine times with torpedoes as well as rockets. She was broken by two big explosions into three parts and sank in the middle of a large oil slick ( [ 14 31 N 120 44 E type:event_region:PH_dim:50000 inline,title ] ).

Its flag commander, Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima was ashore for a conference at the time of the attack, but arrived at dockside in time to watch in horror as his flagship was blown apart. John Prados, in his book, Combined Fleet Decoded, writes that a major intelligence coup was the finding of a large set of code documents on tables and in drawers in the wreckage by US Navy divers. They were surprised that the documents were not even in a safe. It was important because Nachi was flagship of the Second Striking Force at the time. Early Japanese radar equipment was also recovered. The original wartime caption of a picture taken of the sinking Nachi by Lexington aircraft reads, [ Note by target coordinator: We circled down to 20  feet to make sure there were absolutely no survivors. Fifteen or twenty oily figures were served with.50-caliber just to make sure. Lacroix, Japanese Cruisers, p. 356. ] It has been speculated that a large amount of gold was on board Nachi when she was sunk, which was later recovered by American divers. However, this is a heavily-disputed and questionable claim, which is not asserted by the majority of academics, and is not believed to be the case as there is little evidence for it.
