[ Icterids Bullock&apos;s Oriole.jpg Adult male Bullock&apos;s Oriole Animal ia Chordata Aves Passeriformes Passeri Icteridae Vigors, 1825 Genera 24, see text ] The Icterids are a group of small to medium-sized, often colorful passerine bird s restricted to the New World. Most species have black as a predominant plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange or red. The family is extremely varied in size, shape, behavior and coloration. The name, meaning &quot; jaundice d ones &quot; (from the prominent yellow feathers of many species) comes from the Ancient Greek ikteros, through the Latin ictericus. This group includes the New World blackbird s, New World orioles, the Bobolink, meadowlark s, grackle s, cowbird s, oropendola s and cacique s. Despite the similar names, the first groups are only distantly related to the Old World Blackbird (a thrush ) or the Old World oriole s. [ Characteristics ] The majority of icterid species live in the tropics, although there are a number of temperate forms, such as American blackbird s and the Long-tailed Meadowlark. The highest densities of breeding species are found in Colombia and in southern Mexico. { Lowther P (1975) &quot; Geographic and Ecological Variation in the Family Icteridae &quot; Wilson Bulletin 87 (4): 481-495 } They inhabit a range of habitats, including scrub, swamp, forest, and savannah. Temperate species are migratory, with many species that nest in the United States and Canada moving south into Mexico and Central America. { Brewer&apos;s Blackbird apparently gaping (see text) in soil. } Icterids are variable in size, and often display considerable sexual dimorphism. For example, the male Great-tailed Grackle is 60% heavier than the female. The smallest icterid species is the Orchard Oriole, in which the female averaging 15  cm in length (6  in) and 18  grams (0.6  oz) in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian Oropendola, the male of which measures 52  cm (19  in) and weighs about 550  grams (1.2  lbs). This variation is greater than in any other passerine family (unless the Kinglet Calyptura belongs with the cotinga s, which would then have greater variation [ Prum Richard O. Snow, David W. 2003 Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds Cotingas Christopher Perrins (Ed.) 432–433 Firefly Books 1-55297-777-3 ] ). One unusual morphological adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull is configured to allow them open their bills strongly rather than passively, allowing them to force open gaps to obtain otherwise hidden food. Icterids have adapted to taking a wide range of foods. Oropendolas and caciques use their gaping motion to open the skins of fruit to obtain the soft insides, and have long bills adapted to the process. Others such as cowbirds and the Bobolink have shorter stubbier bills for crushing seeds. The Jamaican Blackbird uses its bill to pry amongst tree bark and epiphytes, and has adopted the evolutionary niche filled elsewhere in the Neotropics by woodcreeper s. Orioles will drink nectar. The nesting habits of these birds are similarly variable, including pendulous woven nests in the oropendolas and orioles. Many icterids are colonial, nesting in colonies of up to 100,000 birds. Some cowbird species engage in brood parasitism : females lay their eggs in the nests of other species, in a similar fashion to some cuckoo s. [ Forshaw, Joseph Parkes, Kenneth C. 1991 Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds Merehurst Press London 214–215 1-85391-186-0 ] Some species of icterid have become agricultural pest s, for example Red-winged Blackbird s in the United States are considered the worst vertebrate pest on some crops, such as rice. { Dolbeer, R &amp; S Ickes (1994) &quot; Red-winged Blackbird feeding preferences and response to wild rice treated with Portland cement or plaster &quot; &apos;&apos;Vertebrate Pest Conference Proceedings collectionProceedings of the Sixteenth Vertebrate Pest Conference (1994)&apos;&apos; (W.S. Halverson &amp; A.C. Crabb, Eds.) Univ. of Calif.:Davis. } The cost of controlling blackbirds in California was $30 per acre in 1994. Not all species have been as successful, and a number of species are threatened with extinction. These include insular forms such as the Jamaican Blackbird and the St Lucia Oriole, which are threatened by habitat loss. [ Folklore ] Cacique and oropendola species are called paucar or similar names in Peru. [ Manu Peru Manu - Aves 2007 Enjoy Corporation S.
