Such &quot; council schools &quot;, also referred to in Mississippi lexicon as &quot; academies &quot;, were established by the White Citizens&apos; Council movement in reaction to the demands for racial integration by the American Civil Rights movement. The Blackhawk rally was hosted by the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC). A photograph of Barbour with CCC members appeared on the CCC webpage, and some commentators and pundits demanded that Barbour ask for his picture to be removed from the site, but Barbour refused. Barbour stated that &quot; Once you start down the slippery slope of saying, &apos;That person can&apos;t be for me,&apos; then where do you stop?... I don&apos;t care who has my picture. My picture&apos;s in the public domain. &quot; Barbour&apos;s Democratic opponent, then-governor Ronnie Musgrove, declined to be critical, stating that he had also attended Blackhawk rallies in the past, and would have done so that year except for a scheduling conflict. { &quot; Barbour won&apos;t ask CCC to take photo off Web site &quot; } [ February 2011 ] Historically, both Democrats and Republicans have participated in Blackhawk.

[ Tobacco matters ] Barbour&apos;s taxation policies have come under scrutiny. The &quot; Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids &quot; insinuated that Barbour&apos;s lobbying-era affinity with the tobacco industry may also explain his 2006 proposal to dismantle Mississippi&apos;s controversial youth-tobacco-prevention program, called The Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi.

Moore created the organization when he, representing the State of Mississippi, settled a multi-billion dollar suit with the tobacco industry. According to the lawsuit, the funds were to offset the extra costs incurred by Medicaid while dealing with smoking-related illnesses. Opponents have consistently claimed that Moore uses the organization to further his political ambitions. The Partnership regularly makes huge grants to political organizations such as the Legislative Black Caucus. Many point to additional facts, such as The Partnership not allowing a public audit, which in turn permits the group to have no public accountability of its expenditures of state funds. [ please give a reliable source for this assertion. July 2010 ] In 2006, Judge Jaye Bradley, the same judge who awarded Moore the annual $20  million in 2000, vacated her previous decision. Bradley claimed she did not decide against The Partnership because of its inability to perform but because she believes that the state legislature is the only body that can legally decide how state funds can be delegated. Following the decision, Barbour stated that it says a lot about Judge Bradley &quot;...that she is a strong enough person to have the gumption to vacate her own order. The only way for the state to spend state funding is for the Legislature to appropriate it through the legislative process. &quot; { &quot; No Moore Partnership? &quot;, June 8, 2006 } After an appeal by Moore, Barbour went on to win a Mississippi Supreme Court battle that prevented the tobacco settlement moneys from funding the program, maintaining that it is unconstitutional for a judge to award state proceeds to a private organization. Barbour&apos;s lawyer stated The Partnership was &quot; the most blatant diversion of public funds to a private corporation in the history of the state of Mississippi &quot; as The Partnership refuses to allow a state audit of its expenditures of the state&apos;s money. { &quot; Tobacco Wars &quot; } [ December 2010 ] Barbour has also received criticism from some Mississippi Democrats for his refusal to approve a bill to increase the cigarette tax and decrease the grocery tax passed by the Mississippi House of Representatives during his first term as governor. Mississippi currently has the third-lowest cigarette tax and the highest grocery tax—while being the poorest state in the country. He stated that the lack of revenue generated after the tax swap would quite possibly result in bankrupting the state government, which was already fragile due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The House of Representatives could produce no figures to dispute this assertion. Also, in his successful 2004 campaign, Barbour ran on the platform that he would veto any tax increase.
