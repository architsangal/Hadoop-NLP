[ forestgreen ] [ white ] [ gold ] { Mighty Oaks } { Oakie } The State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF) is an American, specialized, doctoral-granting institution located in the University Hill neighborhood of Syracuse, New York, immediately adjacent to Syracuse University. ESF also operates several regional campuses across central New York, including the Ranger School in Wanakena, New York. The College&apos;s curricula focus on the understanding, management and sustainability of the environment and natural resources. It commemorated its centennial in 2011. { http://www.esf.edu/centennial/ } [ Founding ] [ History of the New York State College of Forestry ] The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was established in 1911 through a bill signed by New York Governor John Alden Dix. The previous year, Governor Hughes had vetoed a bill authorizing such a college. { Rodgers, A.D. Liberty Hyde Bailey: A Story of American Plant Sciences. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1949. } Both bills followed the state&apos;s defunding, in 1903, of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. { http://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ } { http://foresthistory.org/Publications/FHT/FHT1998/cornell.pdf } Originally a unit of Syracuse University, in 1913, the College was made a separate, legal entity. { Hudson River school artist } { Sanford Robinson Gifford, showing the devastation wrought by years of tanbarking and logging. } Syracuse native and constitutional lawyer Louis Marshall, with a summer residence at Knollwood Club on Saranac Lake and a prime mover for the establishment of the Adirondack and Catskill Forest Preserve (New York), became a Syracuse University Trustee in 1910. He confided in Chancellor James R. Day his desire to have an agricultural and forestry school at the University, { http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html } and by 1911 his efforts resulted in a New York State bill to fund the project: the aforementioned appropriation bill signed by Governor Dix. { Alpert, Herbert. Louis Marshall: 1856-1929. 2008. ISBN 978-0-595-48230-6. p. 36. } Marshall was elected president of the college&apos;s Board of Trustees at its first meeting, in 1911; at the time of his death, eighteen years later, he was still president of the Board. { Louis Marshall, &quot; Champion of Liberty &quot;, selected papers and addresses(in 2 volumes), edited by Charles Reznikoff,1957. Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia,PA. } The first dean of the College was William L. Bray, a Ph.D., graduate from the University of Chicago, { http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/ecology/aepsp3.html } botanist, plant ecologist, biogeographer and Professor of Botany at Syracuse University. In 1907 he was made head of the botany department at Syracuse, and in 1908 he started teaching a forestry course in the basement of Lyman Hall. Bray was an associate of Gifford Pinchot, who was the first Chief of the United States Forest Service. { Bray, William. Forest Resources of Texas. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Bureau of Forestry, 1904. } { &quot; The Knothole: Student Life and Government &quot;. April 4, 2008. Volume 61 Issue 9. Retrieved on October 23, 2009. } In 1911, in addition to assuming the deanship of forestry, Bray organized the Agricultural Division at Syracuse University. He remained at Syracuse until 1943 as chair of botany and Dean of the Syracuse Graduate School. { &quot; Chrono-Biographical Sketch: William Bray &quot;. A Biographical History of Biogeography by Charles H. Smith, Ph.D., Joshua Woleben, and Carubie Rodgers/ Retrieved on October 23, 2009. } In 1915, the same year that Dr. Bray published The Development of the Vegetation of New York State, he became one of the founding members, along with Raphael Zon and Yale School of Forestry &apos;s second dean, James W. Toumey, of the Ecological Society of America. { http://www.esa.org/history/peopleid.php } In 1950, the 1917 &quot; activist wing &quot; of that Society formed today&apos;s The Nature Conservancy. { http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html } { http://www.nature.org/pressroom/ip/press/forests.html } Most of the professors, in the early years of the College of Forestry at Syracuse and the Department of Forestry at Cornell&apos;s New York State College of Agriculture were educated in forestry at the Yale School of Forestry. The forestry students at Syracuse but not at Cornell were referred to as &quot; stumpies &quot; by their classmates probably up until woman were admitted to the college. Fifty-two students were enrolled in the school&apos;s first year, the first 11 graduating two years later, in 1913. { SUNY-ESF. 2008. Alumni Directory. 100th Anniversary Edition. Syracuse, NY, p. 455. } One of the hallmarks of the College, its research, dates back to 1912, beginning with a study on what firms were using lumber in the state of New York as well as the wood species and quantities. In 1912, the College opened its Ranger School in Wanakena, New York, in the Adirondacks. The College began enrolling women as early as 1915, but the first women to complete their degrees —one majoring in landscape engineering and two in pulp and paper —graduated in the late 1940s. { &quot; A History of ESF &quot;. SUNY-ESF website. Retrieved on October 26, 2009. } In January 1930, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, recommending an allocation of $600,000 towards construction of the college&apos;s second building, in honor of Louis Marshall, recently deceased, noted that: &quot; under [Marshall&apos;s] leadership and the leadership of its late dean, Franklin Moon, the School of Forestry made giant strides until it became recognized as the premier institution of its kind in the United States &quot;. { Adler, Cyrus, &quot; Louis Marshall: A Biographical Sketch &quot;, American Jewish Year Book, 1930-31, pp. 54-55 } The cornerstone of Louis Marshall Memorial Hall was laid in 1931 by former Governor and presidential candidate Alfred E. Smith who was elected to assume the presidency of the college&apos;s Board of Trustees. With the formation of the State University of New York (SUNY) in 1948, the College became recognized as a specialized college within the SUNY system, and its name was changed to State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. In 1972, the College&apos;s name was changed yet again to State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Unlike other state-supported degree-granting institutions which had been created at private institutions in New York State, the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was an autonomous institution not administratively part of Syracuse University. In 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF&apos;s &quot; primacy &quot; among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies.

Salins ] [ Campuses ] [ Main campus ] The Syracuse campus is ESF&apos;s main campus, and is where most academic and administrative activity takes place. It is made up of seven (soon to be eight) main buildings: Baker Laboratory: Named after Hugh P. Baker, Dean of the College from 1912–1920 and again 1930-33. The building is the location of several computer clusters and auditorium-style classrooms. It is home to the Department of Construction Management and Wood Products Engineering, and the Department of Environmental Resources and Forest Engineering. The building recently underwent a $37 million overhaul; providing updated space for the Tropical Timber Information Center and the Nelson C. Brown Center for Ultrastructure Studies. When the renovation is complete, Baker Lab will be the site of ESF&apos;s NASA-affiliated Research Center. Baker Laboratory houses two multimedia lecture halls, a &quot; smart &quot; classroom outfitted for computer use and distance learning, and two construction management and planning studios. It also has a full-scale laboratory for materials science testing, including a modern dry kiln, a wood identification laboratory, shop facilities (including portable sawmill) and wood preservation laboratory. &quot; ESF&apos;s Baker Laboratory Revamped for Engineering &quot;. ESF Office of Communications. Retrieved on October 23, 2009. Bray Hall: The building is the oldest on campus, completed in 1917, the largest building devoted to Forestry at the time. It is named after William L. Bray, a founder of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University and its first Dean, 1911-12. It is the location of most administrative offices, and the Department of Forest and Natural Resources Management. Illick Hall: The building was completed in 1968, and is home to the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology. It is named after Joseph S. Illick, a dean of the State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. There is a large lecture hall (Illick 5) in the basement. Several greenhouses are located on the fifth floor. The Roosevelt Wildlife Museum is also located in the building. All of the bathrooms in this buildings mysteriously smell horrid, despite being very clean. Jahn Laboratory: Named after Edwin C.

Home to the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Studies departments. The Alumni (Nifkin) Lounge, Gallery (snack bar), Campus Bookstore, and Marshall Auditorium are located within. Twin brass plaques in the entryway commemorate the contributions of Marshall and his son, alumnus Bob Marshall. Moon Library: Dedicated to F. Franklin Moon, an early dean of the College. Completed in 1968, along with Illick Hall. A computer cluster and student lounge are located in the basement. Walters Hall: Named after J. Henry Walters, who served on the College&apos;s Board of Trustees. Completed in 1969. Home to the Department of Paper and Bioprocess Engineering. The pilot plant in the building includes two paper machines and wood-to-ethanol processing equipment. Gateway Building: Currently under construction: &quot; The SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) broke ground Friday, Aug. 6, 2010, for construction of the new Gateway Building, a $28.3 million project that will showcase the college&apos;s commitment to sustainability through a sophisticated array of renewable energy technologies. &quot; The new building will be a showcase for green infrastructure and development. &quot; The Gateway Building&apos;s design and construction sets a new standard for LEED buildings, producing more renewable energy than it consumes, &quot; said ESF President Cornelius B. Murphy, Jr. The building is expected to be completed with LEED Platinum certification. http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=415 Bray Hall, Marshall Hall, Illick Hall, and Moon Library border the quad. The college&apos;s first-ever, on-campus dormitories, dubbed Centennial Hall after the institution&apos;s 100th anniversary, opened for student occupancy in August 2011. Other buildings on the Syracuse campus include one for maintenance and operations, a garage, and a greenhouse converted to office space. Among planned new buildings is a research support facility. The historical Robin Hood Oak is located behind Bray Hall. The tree is said to have grown from an acorn brought back by a faculty member from the Sherwood Forest in England. It was the first tree to be listed on the National Registrar of Historic Trees in the United States.

[ Academics ] The ESF mission statement is &quot; to advance knowledge and skills and to promote the leadership necessary for the stewardship of both the natural and designed environments. &quot; { &quot; ESF Mission &amp; Vision &quot;. SUNY-ESF website. Retrieved on October 23, 2009. } ESF is a &quot; specialized institution &quot; of the State University of New York, meaning that curricula focus primarily on one field, the College&apos;s being environmental management and stewardship. Students supplement their education with courses taken at Syracuse University. ESF has academic departments in the fields of chemistry; construction management and wood products engineering; environmental and forest biology; environmental resources and forest engineering; environmental science; environmental studies; forest and natural resources management; landscape architecture; and paper and bioprocess engineering. Interdepartmental environmental science programs offer students integrative degrees across the natural sciences. ESF is considered a very competitive school. Admission is more selective, with an acceptance rate of 43.1 percent for fall 2009. ESF is ranked at 34th, tied with Michigan State University, and Miami-Ohio, and ahead of all other SUNY schools in the 2011 U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings of the top public national universities. Furthermore, ESF is ranked 79th in the 2011 US News &amp; World Report list of the best National Universities (both public and private), also ahead of all other SUNY schools. The Washington Monthly College Guide has ranked ESF No. 26 among the nation&apos;s top service-oriented colleges and universities. [ 79 26 277 ] Forbes Magazine ranked SUNY-ESF #23 in its listing of “America’s Best College Buys” for 2010. Forbes.com has also ranked SUNY-ESF at No. 3 on its 2010 list of the 20 best colleges for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). SUNY-ESF is listed at No. 2, ahead of top programs like Duke, Cornell and Yale, among the best college environmental programs in the nation by Treehugger.com, a website devoted to sustainability and environmental news. DesignIntelligence magazine has ranked ESF&apos;s undergraduate and graduate programs in &quot; Landscape Architecture &quot;, respectively at No. 12 and No. 9 in the United States. [ Campus life ] Many students identify themselves as a &quot; Stumpy &quot; (or &quot; Stumpie &quot; ). The nickname was given to students by their neighbors at Syracuse University, probably in the 1920s, and most-likely refers to forestry &quot; stump jumpers &quot;. Although originally used as an insult, today, most students embrace the nickname with pride. Students at the Syracuse campus enjoy many activities on and off campus. There are a number of student clubs and organizations at ESF, including the Undergraduate Student Association, Graduate Student Association, Woodsmen Team, Bob Marshall Club, Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society, Soccer Club, Sigma Lambda Alpha Honor Society, The Knothole (weekly newspaper), Papyrus Club, The Empire Forester (yearbook), Landscape Architecture Club (formally the Mollet Club), Forest Engineers Club, Environmental Studies Student Organization, Habitat for Humanity, Ecologue (yearly journal), the Bioethics Society, Green Campus Initiative, and Baobab Society. Wanakena students have their own woodsmen and ice hockey teams. A number of professional organizations are also open to student membership, including the Society of American Foresters, Wildlife Society, Conservation Biology club, American Fisheries Association, and the (currently defunct) American Water Resources Association. ESF has an agreement with adjacent Syracuse University that allows ESF students to enjoy many amenities offered by SU. ESF students take courses at their sister institution, can apply for admission to concurrent degree and joint certificate programs, and may join any SU organization except for NCAA sports teams. SU students are also welcome to enroll in ESF classes. Because of this, students feel a certain degree of integration with the Syracuse University community. Every May, ESF holds a joint commencement ceremony with Syracuse University in the Carrier Dome. ESF&apos;s baccalaureate diplomas bear the seals of both the State University of New York and Syracuse University. Students also enjoy a variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theaters in Syracuse, and nearby Marshall Street and Westcott Street. [ Athletics ] SUNY-ESF is currently affiliated with the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), fielding six teams in four sports: Cross-country, men&apos;s &amp; women&apos;s Golf, men&apos;s Soccer, men&apos;s and women&apos;s Basketball, men&apos;s The school&apos;s men&apos;s cross-country team were the 2011 USCAA national champions. The women&apos;s cross-country team came in second in the same tournament. { SUNY-ESF, &quot; Mighty Oaks Men Win National Cross-Country Championship, &quot; November 11, 2011. Accessed: May 18, 2012. } ESF has a long tradition of competing in intercollegiate woodsman competitions in the northeastern US and eastern Canada. The team came in first in both the men&apos;s and women&apos;s divisions of the northeastern US and Canadian 2012 spring meet. { SUNY-ESF, &quot; Men’s, Women’s Teams Win Timber Sports Spring Meet &quot;. Accessed: May 18, 2012. } In addition to the intercollegiate USCAA and woodsman teams, ESF students also play on club sports teams, both at ESF and Syracuse University. [ Affiliation with Syracuse University ] ESF was founded in 1911 as the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee Louis Marshall, with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed the Governor&apos;s veto of annual appropriations to a separate New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. { Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University, 1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 161, Cornell University Press } ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from Syracuse University, even while some resources, facilities and infrastructure are shared. { http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html } The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students take courses at both institutions, and baccalaureate diplomas from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with that of the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools, as well. The college receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college&apos;s educational facilities. The state has somewhat similar financial and working relationships with five statutory college s that are at Alfred University and Cornell University, although unlike ESF, these statutory institutions are legally and technically part of their respective host institutions and are essentially day-to-day administered by them as well. ESF faculty, students, and students&apos; families join those from Syracuse University (SU) in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August, and combined commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to libraries, recreational facilities, student clubs, and other activities at both institutions, except for the schools&apos; intercollegiate sports teams, affiliated with the NCAA and NAIA, respectively. [ http://www.esf.edu/welcome/esfsu.htm The ESF-SU Relationship State University of New York 2008-09-18 ] [ Traditions ] The best known tradition among ESF students is that walking across the quad is shunned. The tradition, which dates back to at least the early 1960s, is intended to inhibit tracks from being worn into the lawn. Hecklers have been known to yell and even tackle people walking across the quad. However, other activities such as Frisbee and soccer playing are encouraged on the Quad. Eustace B. Nifkin, ESF&apos;s previous mascot, is an unofficial student. He first appeared in the 1940s after a group of students summering in the Adirondacks thought him up. Ever since, he has appeared on class rosters, written articles for The Knothole, and sent mail to the College from around the world. He has a girlfriend, the lesser-known Elsa S. Freeborn. SUNY granted him a bachelor&apos;s degree in 1972. The Alumni Lounge in Marshall Hall is dedicated to Nifkin. Another well known legend is that of Chainer or Chainsaw who supposedly graduated in 1993. Traditional events include: Earth Week events Spring Banquet December Soiree Friends and Family BBQ Coffee Haus Festival of Places Paper run Donut Hours Waste Audit Free Movies Nights Insomniacs Woodsmen Team (Forestry Club) [ Alumni ] More than 18,000 have graduated from ESF since its founding in 1911.
