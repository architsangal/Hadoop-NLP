[ 75.1 ] { D000649 } Amniocentesis (also referred to as amniotic fluid test or AFT) is a medical procedure { The word amniocentesis itself indicates precisely the procedure in question, } { Gr. ἀμνίον amníon being the &quot; inner membrane round the foetus &quot; and κέντησις kéntēsis meaning &quot; pricking &quot;, i.e. its puncture in order to retrieve some } { amniotic fluid. } used in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections, [ http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/amniosentesis.htm Diagnostic Tests – Amniocentesis Harvard Medical School 2008-07-15 ] in which a small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amnion or amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus, and the fetal DNA is examined for genetic abnormalities. This process can be used for prenatal sex discernment and hence this procedure has legal restrictions in some gender -biased countries. [ Procedure ] Before the start of the procedure, a local anesthetic can be given to the mother in order to relieve the pain felt during the insertion of the needle used to withdraw the fluid. After the local is in effect, a needle is usually inserted through the mother&apos;s abdominal wall, then through the wall of the uterus, and finally into the amniotic sac. With the aid of ultrasound-guidance, a physician punctures the sac in an area away from the fetus and extracts approximately 20  ml of amniotic fluid. If used for prenatal genetic diagnosis, fetal cells are separated from the extracted sample. The cells are grown in a culture medium, then fixed and stained. Under a microscope the chromosomes are examined for abnormalities. The most common abnormalities detected are Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), and Turner syndrome (monosomy X). In regard to the fetus, the puncture heals and the amniotic sac replenishes the liquid over the next 24–48 hours.

[ Lung maturity ] Amniocentesis can predict fetal lung maturity, which is inversely correlated to the risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome. In pregnancies of greater than 30 weeks, the fetal lung maturity may be tested by sampling the amount of surfactant in the amniotic fluid. Several tests are available that correlate with the production of surfactant. These include the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio ( &quot; L/S ratio &quot; ), the presence of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and more recently, the surfactant/albumin (S/A) ratio. For the L/S ratio, if the result is less than 2:1, the fetal lungs may be surfactant deficient. The presence of PG usually indicates fetal lung maturity. For the S/A ratio, the result is given as mg of surfactant per gm of protein. An S/A ratio &lt; 35 indicates immature lungs, between 35-55 is indeterminate, and &gt; 55 indicates mature surfactant production(correlates with an L/S ratio of 2.2 or greater). [ Other ] Amniocentesis can also be used to detect problems such as: [ 16506709 ] Infection, in which amniocentesis can detect a decreased glucose level, a Gram stain showing bacteria or an abnormal differential count of white blood cells. Rh incompatibility Decompression of polyhydramnios An emerging indication for amniocentesis is in the management of preterm rupture of membranes where measurement of certain amniotic fluid inflammatory markers may be helpful. If amniotic fluid IL-6, a marker of inflammation, is elevated, the fetus is at high risk and delivery should be considered.

Committee opinion, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. } In contrast to amniocentesis, the risk of miscarriage from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is believed to be approximately 1 in 100, although CVS may be done up to four weeks earlier, and may be preferable if the possibility of genetic defects is thought to be higher.

These stem cells would also, if used to treat the same individual they came from, sidestep the donor/recipient issue which has so far stymied all attempts to use donor-derived stem cells in therapies. Artificial heart valves, working tracheas, as well as muscle, fat, bone, heart, neural and liver cells have all been engineered through use of amniotic stem cells [ March 2012 ].
