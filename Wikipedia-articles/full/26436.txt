It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists and musicians struggling to survive and create in New York&apos;s Lower East Side in the thriving days of Bohemian Alphabet City, under the shadow of HIV / AIDS. The musical was first seen in a limited three-week workshop production at New York Theatre Workshop in 1994. This same New York City off-Broadway theatre was also the musical&apos;s initial home following its official January 25, 1996 opening. The show&apos;s creator, Jonathan Larson, died suddenly the night before the off-Broadway premiere. The show won a Pulitzer Prize, and the production was a hit. The musical moved to Broadway&apos;s larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996.

The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008 after a 12-year run of 5,124 performances, the ninth-longest-running Broadway show at the time. The production grossed over $280 million. { Time Magazine, March 10, 2008 issue, p. 66 } The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions. In 2005 it was adapted into a motion picture that features most of the original cast members. [ Concept and genesis ] In 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create &quot; a musical based on Puccini &apos;s La Bohème, in which the luscious splendor of Puccini&apos;s world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York. &quot; [ Rent ( &quot; Leap of Faith &quot; ) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn%3D1164910567 Larson Jonathan Jonathan Larson Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine 1997 18–37 HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins New York, New York 0-688-15437-9 ] In 1989 Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed a few songs together, including &quot; Santa Fe &quot;, &quot; Splatter &quot; (later re-worked into the song &quot; Rent &quot; ), and &quot; I Should Tell You &quot;. Larson made the suggestion to set the play in the East Village, the artsy avant-garde neighborhood of Manhattan down the street from his Greenwich Village apartment, and also came up with the show&apos;s ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that &quot; rent &quot; also means torn apart.). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson&apos;s original concept and make Rent his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for Rent; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera &quot; to bring musical theater to the MTV generation. &quot; [ Tommasini Anthony The Seven-Year Odyssey That Led to Rent The New York Times 1996-03-17 http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9507E1D91639F934A25750C0A960958260 Section 2 Page 7 true ] Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds. Jonathan Larson focused on composing Rent in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the Moondance Diner to support himself. Over the course of seven years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained forty-two songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of Rent&apos;s script. When Rent had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot. As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of Rent featured songs that never made it to the final version, such as &quot; You&apos;re A Fool &quot;, Voice Mail #4 &quot;, &quot; Come To The Meeting &quot;, &quot; Open Road &quot;, &quot; He Says &quot;, &quot; On The Street #1-3 &quot;, &quot; You&apos;ll Get Over It &quot;, the predecessor of &quot; Tango: Maureen, &quot; featuring Mark and Maureen; &quot; Right Brain &quot;, the predecessor to &quot; One Song Glory, &quot; featuring Roger; &quot; Do A Little Business &quot;, the predecessor of &quot; You&apos;ll See, &quot; featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins, and Angel; &quot; Female to Female A &amp; B, &quot; featuring Maureen and Joanne; and &quot; Real Estate &quot;, a number where Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his film making. This workshop version of Rent starred Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi. Larson continued to work on Rent, gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions. { Rapp, Anthony. Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent (2006) Simon &amp; Schuster ISBN 0-7432-6976-4 } On January 24, 1996, after the musical&apos;s final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson enjoyed his first (and only) newspaper interview with music critic Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times, attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini&apos;s opera. Larson would not live to see Rent&apos;s success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm (believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome ) in the early morning of January 25, 1996. The first preview of Rent was canceled and instead, friends and family gathered at the theater where the actors performed a sing-through of Rent in Larson&apos;s memory. The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theatre Workshop. Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, Rent moved to Broadway&apos;s previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996. [ Sources and inspiration ] Larson&apos;s inspiration for Rent&apos;s content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini&apos;s opera La bohème, the world premiere of which was in 1896 –- 100 years before Rent&apos;s premiere. La bohème was also about the lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini&apos;s opera, is replaced by AIDS in Rent; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York&apos;s East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of Rent&apos;s characters also heavily reflect Puccini&apos;s original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in Rent represents the character of Alcindoro in Bohème, but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only Rent character whose predecessor in La bohème is the opposite gender. La bohème Rent Mimi, a seamstress with tuberculosis Mimi Márquez, an S &amp; M dancer with HIV Rodolfo, a poet Roger Davis, a songwriter-musician who is HIV positive Marcello, a painter Mark Cohen, an independent Jewish filmmaker and Roger&apos;s roommate Musetta, a singer Maureen Johnson, a lesbian Rapp, p. 19 performance artist Schaunard, a musician Angel Dumott Schunard, a gay drag queen percussionist with AIDS Colline, a philosopher Tom Collins, a gay philosophy professor (Not full-time) at New York University and anarchist with AIDS Alcindoro, a state councilor Joanne Jefferson, a lesbian lawyer, who is Maureen&apos;s girlfriend. (Also partially based on Marcello) Benoit, a landlord Benjamin &apos;Benny&apos; Coffin III, the local landlord and a former roommate of Roger, Mark, Collins, and Maureen. Other examples of parallels between Larson&apos;s and Puccini&apos;s work include Larson&apos;s song &quot; Light My Candle &quot;, which is nearly identical to the first scene between Mimi and Rodolfo in La bohème, &quot; Quando me n&apos;vo (Musetta&apos;s Waltz) &quot;, a melody taken directly from Puccini&apos;s opera, and &quot; Goodbye Love &quot;, a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini&apos;s and Larson&apos;s work. [ http://www.impresario.ch/libretto/libpucboh_e.htm La bohème  —Libretto in English Kernkonzepte: Impresario Puccini, Giacomo Giacomo Puccini ] &quot; Quando me n&apos; vo&apos; &quot; is paralleled in the first verse of &quot; Take Me or Leave Me, &quot; when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, &quot; Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song... &quot; Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, &quot;...that doesn&apos;t remind us of &apos;Musetta&apos;s Waltz&apos;. &quot; Rent is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in &quot; Rent &quot; ]) made their way into the play. [ Beals, Gregory The World of Rent Newsweek 1996-05-13 CXXVII 20 58–59 ] { ( Abstract ) } Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson&apos;s own girlfriend left him for a woman. The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson&apos;s friend, documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein. Playwright Sarah Schulman alleged that Rent bore striking similarities to her novel People in Trouble. [ http://www.slate.com/id/2131017 2011-03-03 Sarah Schulman: the writer Rent ripped off November 23, 2005 June Thomas Slate.com ] The line, &quot; I&apos;m more of a man than you&apos;ll ever be... and more of a woman than you&apos;ll ever get! &quot;, attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at his funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films Mannequin (1987) and Mannequin Two: On the Move (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood is a flamboyantly homosexual man who performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women&apos;s clothing; however, the line was originally in the film Car Wash (1976) as delivered by Antonio Fargas, a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser. The earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off Oedipus in her performance piece instead of Hey Diddle Diddle; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a jazz philosopher, while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like &quot; Real Estate &quot;, which was later cut. { SiteforRent.com accessed April 15, 2007. } Life Café Many actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. The Life Café, where the &quot; La Vie Boheme &quot; numbers are set, is an actual restaurant in the East Village of New York City. [ http://www.lifecafenyc.com/ls_press.shtml Making Rent; A Spell for Alphabet City 2007-01-05 Life Cafe 2005, 1998 Ben Lerman; Andrew Jacobs Life Press ] [ Rent ( &quot; Connection &quot; ) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn%3D1164910567 Larson Jonathan Jonathan Larson Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine 1997 138–141 HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins New York, New York 0-688-15437-9 ] The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village conflicts of the late 1980s that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park. &quot; Will I? &quot;, a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line in the single stanza of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali, and Pam carry the names of Larson&apos;s friends who died of AIDS. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) are changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who are living with or have died from AIDS. [ Rent ( &quot; Leap of Faith: Friends in Deed &quot; ) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn%3D1164910567 Larson Jonathan Jonathan Larson Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine 1997 21 HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins New York, New York 0-688-15437-9 ] The scene and song &quot; Life Support &quot; was also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the &quot; forget regret &quot; refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan&apos;s HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this &quot; credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay? &quot; Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, &quot; Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today? &quot; Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, &quot; Then why choose fear? &quot; Gordon says, &quot; I&apos;m a New Yorker. Fear&apos;s my life. &quot; [ Lynn Thomson controversy ] Lynn Thomson was a dramaturg who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework Rent. She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a &quot; new version &quot; of the musical. She sued the Larson estate for $40 million USD and sought 16% of the show&apos;s royalties, claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the &quot; new version &quot; of Rent. During the trial, Thomson could not recall the lyrics to the songs that she wrote or the structures of the libretto she created. The judge ruled against her and gave the Jonathan Larson Estate full credit and right to Rent. A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

Mark Cohen, an aspiring filmmaker, begins a new documentary, as his roommate, Roger Davis, tunes up his guitar ( &quot; Tune Up #1 &quot; ) but they are quickly interrupted by a call from Mark&apos;s mother, who wishes Mark a Merry Christmas and claims she was sorry to hear about his recent break-up with Maureen Johnson ( &quot; Voicemail #1 &quot; ). Roger and Mark&apos;s friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist and college professor, arrives at their building but is mugged before he can enter. Meanwhile, Roger and Mark receive a call from their former friend and roommate Benjamin &quot; Benny &quot; Coffin III. After marrying a woman from a wealthy family, Benny bought Mark and Roger&apos;s apartment building, as well as the lot next door. He tells them last year&apos;s rent is due, despite his promise to let them live there for free ( &quot; Tune Up #2 &quot; ). Mark and Roger refuse to pay their rent ( &quot; Rent &quot; ). Meanwhile, a drag queen named Angel Dumott Schunard (appearing in men&apos;s clothing for this scene) finds Collins on the street and gets him on his feet ( &quot; You Okay Honey? &quot; ). The revelation that they both have AIDS kindles friendship. Back at the loft, Mark tries to get Roger out of the apartment, but Roger refuses. Mark reveals that Roger has been living in withdrawal for the past year due to his girlfriend April&apos;s suicide. Mark leaves to find Collins after reminding Roger to take his AZT ( &quot; Tune Up #3 &quot; ). Roger attempts to write a great song to make his mark on the world before he dies of AIDS ( &quot; One Song Glory &quot; ). Their downstairs neighbor, a club dancer and drug addict named Mimi Marquéz walks in, asking Roger to light a candle for her, only to continually blow it out so that she may flirt with him ( &quot; Light My Candle &quot; ). Joanne Jefferson, a lawyer and Maureen&apos;s new girlfriend, receives a phone call from her parents, wondering why she is stage managing for Maureen&apos;s protest and reminding her that she has to attend her mother&apos;s confirmation hearings ( &quot; Voicemail #2 &quot; ). Angel, now in drag, and Collins arrive bearing gifts including alcohol and a box of Cap&apos;n Crunch. Collins introduces Angel to his friends ( &quot; Today 4 U &quot; ). Benny arrives with an offer: if they convince Maureen to cancel her protest against him building a Cyber Studio in the lot next door, he&apos;ll let them live in his new studio project, rent-free ( &quot; You&apos;ll See &quot; ). However, the two rebuff his offer. After Benny leaves, Angel and Collins invite Mark and Roger to attend Life Support, a local HIV support group meeting. Mark hurries off to help fix Maureen&apos;s sound equipment for the protest, only to run into Maureen&apos;s new girlfriend Joanne, and the two of them commiserate about Maureen&apos;s flighty, unfaithful ways ( &quot; Tango: Maureen &quot; ). He then enters—slightly late—into the support group meeting ( &quot; Life Support &quot; ). Meanwhile, Mimi attempts to seduce Roger ( &quot; Out Tonight &quot; ) but Roger, afraid to fall in love again, harshly rebuffs her ( &quot; Another Day &quot; ). After Mimi leaves, Roger admits to an empty apartment his fears about dying from AIDS while the group at Life Support admits their fears as well ( &quot; Will I? &quot; ). On their way to Maureen&apos;s protest, Collins, Mark and Angel help a homeless woman who is being harassed by police officers. She then mocks Mark for trying to assuage his guilt while not really doing anything to help them ( &quot; On the Street &quot; ). Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York and opening up a restaurant in Santa Fe ( &quot; Santa Fe &quot; ). Soon after, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other and begin a relationship ( &quot; I&apos;ll Cover You &quot; ). Joanne exasperatedly prepares for Maureen&apos;s show ( &quot; We&apos;re Okay &quot; ). Roger intercepts Mimi on her way to buy drugs and apologizes for his behavior. He invites her to come to the protest and dinner with them, to which she agrees. Meanwhile, people from the streets protest for not having a place to spend Christmas ( &quot; Christmas Bells &quot; ). Maureen arrives and begins her performance: A thinly-veiled criticism of Benny through a metaphor involving a cow and a bulldog, culminating in her urging the crowd to &quot; moo &quot; with her ( &quot; Over The Moon &quot; ). At the Life Café after the show, Benny criticizes the protest and the group&apos;s Bohemian lifestyle, declaring that Bohemia is dead. Mark and all the bohemians in the café rise up and celebrate the Bohemian lifestyle, paying tribute to everything they love, driving Benny from the café ( &quot; La Vie Boheme A &quot; ). Mimi confronts Roger about ignoring her during dinner. Roger tries to explain that he has baggage, but Mimi isn&apos;t fazed. Then, as Mimi&apos;s beeper goes off (reminding her to take her AZT) she and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive ( &quot; I Should Tell You &quot; ). Joanne returns, explaining that Mark and Roger&apos;s building has been padlocked and that Benny has called the police in response to the evicted residents of Avenue B rioting and &quot; mooing &quot; in the streets. As the first act closes, Mark reveals that amidst the riot, Roger and Mimi share their first kiss ( &quot; La Vie Boheme B &quot; ). [ Act II ] Cast of &apos;&apos;Rent&apos;&apos; performing &quot; Seasons of Love &quot; at &apos;&apos;Broadway on Broadway&apos;&apos;, 2005. Opening with &quot; Seasons of Love &quot; - a song which contemplates how to measure a year in a life - the second act takes place over the course of the year following the first act, beginning on New Years Eve ( &quot; Seasons of Love &quot; ). Having been locked out of their apartment by Benny; Mark, Roger, and the Bohemians gather to break-in ( &quot; Happy New Year A &quot; ). We learn through a series of voicemails ( &quot; Voicemail #3 &quot; ) that Mark had filmed the riot which had made the nightly news and gained him the attention of media producer Alexi Darling. The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives. He says he&apos;s there to call a truce, but the group doesn&apos;t trust him. He reveals that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind by making sexual advances on him. Mimi denies seducing Benny, but the revelation that they had once been together upsets Roger and he briefly rebuffs her before Angel settles everyone down. Roger and Mimi both apologize, but Mimi remains upset, and turns to the drug dealer for a fix ( &quot; Happy New Year B &quot; ). While setting up for another protest, Maureen and Joanne have a fight, giving each other relationship ultimatums. Maureen&apos;s flirtatious ways and Joanne&apos;s controlling behavior are too much for the other to take, so they break up ( &quot; Take Me Or Leave Me &quot; ). The company sings a reprise of &quot; Seasons of Love &quot;, as time passes and seasons change ( &quot; Seasons of Love B &quot; ). By spring, Roger and Mimi&apos;s relationship becomes strained. Roger keeps talking about moving out of town. Mimi comes home late again, causing Roger to believe that she is cheating on him with Benny. Roger jealously storms out, Mimi stops him and tries to tell him the truth, that she is not cheating and that she is still using drugs, but can&apos;t get the words out, and Roger leaves. Alone in the apartment, Mimi sings of her love for Roger, and elsewhere, Roger sings of his love for Mimi ( &quot; Without You &quot; ). Collins continues nursing Angel who is very sick as AIDS begins to overtake him. Mark continues to receive calls from Alexi Darling at Buzzline, a tabloid news program ( &quot; Voicemail #4 &quot; ). Eventually, Roger and Mimi, and Joanne and Maureen, reconcile. They then break up just as quickly ( &quot; Contact &quot; ). At the same time, Angel dies, leaving Collins heartbroken ( &quot; I&apos;ll Cover You [Reprise] &quot; ). At Angel&apos;s funeral, Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS ( &quot; Halloween &quot; ). He finally accepts the job offer from Buzzline. Roger reveals that he is leaving New York for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel&apos;s funeral. Maureen and Joanne realize their fighting is petty, and they reconcile. Mimi tries to go to Roger, but he turns away. After everyone leaves, Mark confronts Roger about his behavior towards Mimi. As the two friends fight, Mark reveals that Roger&apos;s feelings aren&apos;t jealousy towards Benny, but fear of losing Mimi to AIDS. As Roger leaves, he runs into Mimi, who claims that she heard everything and just wanted to tell Roger goodbye ( &quot; Goodbye Love &quot; ). Roger and Mark both have an artistic epiphany, as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel&apos;s memory. Roger returns to New York just in time for Christmas, and Mark quits Buzzline to work on his own film ( &quot; What You Own &quot; ). Worried about their children not answering their calls, the cast&apos;s parents leave several messages on their phones ( &quot; Voice Mail #5 &quot; ). On Christmas Eve, one year to date from where the show started, Mark has finished his film and is ready to screen it. Roger has found his song but can&apos;t find Mimi anywhere. Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a convenience store to provide money to anybody with the code (A-N-G-E-L). Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who is very weak and close to death. She begins to fade, but not before telling Roger that she loves him ( &quot; Finale A &quot; ). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, which reveals the depths of his feelings for her ( &quot; Your Eyes &quot; ). Mimi appears to die, but suddenly awakens. She says that she was heading into a light, but Angel told her to go back. The surviving Bohemians and Benny gather together to rejoice and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other and reaffirm that there is &quot; no day but today &quot; ( &quot; Finale B &quot; ).
