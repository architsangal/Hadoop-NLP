It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively S$ to distinguish it from other dollar -denominated currencies. It is divided into 100 cent s. [ History ] Between 1845 and 1939, Singapore used the Straits dollar.

The currencies of the 3 countries were interchangeable at par value under the Interchangeability Agreement until 8 May 1973 when the Malaysian government decided to terminate it. Brunei and Singapore however continue with the Agreement until the present day. ] This was replaced by the Malayan dollar, and, from 1953, the Malaya and British Borneo dollar, which were issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. Singapore continued to use the common currency upon joining Malaysia in 1963 but, two years after Singapore&apos;s expulsion and independence from Malaysia in 1965, the monetary union between Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei broke down. Singapore established the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore, on April 7, 1967 [ Low Siang Kok, Director (Quality), Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore The Future of Money / Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 2002-06-22 http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/40/31/35391062.pdf PDF 2007-12-28 OECD Publications France 92-64-19672-2 147 Chapter 6: Singapore Electronic Legal Tender (SELT) – A Proposed Concept The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore (BCCS) was established on 7 April 1967 by the enactment of the Currency Act (Chapter 69). It has the sole right to issue currency notes and coins as legal tender in Singapore. ] and issued its first coins and notes. Nevertheless, the Singapore dollar was exchangeable at par with the Malaysian ringgit until 1973, and interchangeability with the Brunei dollar is still maintained. Initially, the Singapore dollar was pegged to the British pound sterling at a rate of S$60 = £7. This peg lasted until the demise of the Sterling Area in the early 1970s, after which the Singapore dollar was linked to the US dollar for a short period of time. As Singapore&apos;s economy grew and its trade links diversified to many other countries and regions, Singapore moved towards pegging its currency against a fixed and undisclosed trade-weighted basket of currencies from 1973 to 1985. From 1985 onwards, Singapore adopted a more market-oriented exchange regime – classified as a Monitoring Band – in which the Singapore dollar is allowed to float (within an undisclosed bandwidth of a central parity) but closely monitored by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) against a concealed basket of currencies of Singapore&apos;s major trading partners and competitors. This in theory allows the Singaporean government to have more control over imported inflation and to ensure that Singapore&apos;s exports remain competitive. All issued Singapore dollar currency in circulation is fully backed by international assets to maintain public confidence. { International Economics - Historical Exchange Rate Regime of Asian Countries The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Copyright 2000. Retrieved August 15, 2008. } The foreign reserves officially stand at over US$230 billion - as of May 2011. Prior to 1970, the various monetary functions associated with a central bank were performed by several government departments and agencies. As Singapore progressed, the demands of an increasingly complex banking and monetary environment necessitated streamlining the functions to facilitate the development of a more dynamic and coherent policy on monetary matters. Therefore, parliament passed the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act in 1970, leading to the formation of MAS on 1 January 1971. The MAS Act gave the MAS the authority to regulate all elements of monetary, banking, and financial aspects of Singapore.On 31 March 2003, the Board of Commissioners of Currency Singapore (BCCS) merged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which took over the responsibility of banknote issuance.

There are both paper and polymer notes in circulation. The designs of the polymer notes are very similar to the corresponding paper note except for the slightly slippery feel and a small transparent window design in the corner of the banknote. Polymer notes are progressively replacing the paper banknotes in circulation. The notes also have Braille patterns at the top right-hand corner of the front design. 4th Series – Portrait Series (1999–present) Image Value Dimensions Main Colour Description Date of issue Status Material Obverse Reverse Obverse Reverse $2 $2 $2 126 × 63  mm Purple President Yusof bin Ishak, Money Cowrie Education September 9, 1999 Circulation Paper $2 $2 January 12, 2006 Polymer $5 $5 $5 133 × 66  mm Green President Yusof bin Ishak, Gold-Ringed Cowrie Garden City September 9, 1999 Paper $5 $5 May 18, 2007 Polymer $10 $10 $10 141 × 69  mm Red President Yusof bin Ishak, Wandering Cowrie Sports September 9, 1999 Paper $10 $10 May 4, 2004 Polymer $50 $50 $50 156 × 74  mm Blue President Yusof bin Ishak, Cylindrical Cowrie Arts September 9, 1999 Paper $100 $100 $100 162 × 77  mm Orange President Yusof bin Ishak, Swallow Cowrie Youth Paper $1000 $1000 $1000 170 × 83  mm Pink President Yusof bin Ishak, Beautiful Cowrie Government Paper $10000 $10000 $10,000 180 × 90  mm Gold President Yusof bin Ishak, Onyx Cowrie Economics Paper The S$10,000 and B$ 10000 note are the world&apos;s most valuable banknote (that is officially in circulation).
