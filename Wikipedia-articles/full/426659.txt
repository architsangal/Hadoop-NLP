[ 1949 10 05 ] { Regina, Saskatchewan } { Liberal } { Regina, } { Saskatchewan } { Barrister, solicitor, broadcaster, business executive, lawyer } { Pam Goodale } Ralph Edward Goodale, PC, MP (born October 5, 1949) was Canada &apos;s Minister of Finance from 2003 to 2006 and continues to be a Liberal Member of Parliament. He was named Opposition House Leader by interim Liberal leader Bill Graham in 2006, and continued to serve in this role under the leadership of Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff until September 2010 when he was promoted to Deputy Leader. [ Early life ] Goodale was born in Regina, Saskatchewan and raised on a farm near Wilcox, Saskatchewan. He was a member of Scouts Canada and earned the rank of Queen&apos;s Scout. [ December 2011 ] He first attended the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus and then obtained a law degree from the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, where he was awarded the Gold Medal for academic achievement. [ Federal politics, 1974-1979 ] Active at politics from a young age, he was first elected to the Parliament of Canada in the 1974 election at the age of 24. He served as backbench MP until the 1979 election, when he was defeated. [ Provincial politics ] In 1981, Goodale was named leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party. He led that party to a very poor showing in the 1982 provincial election, in which the party received 4.51% of the popular vote and won no seats in the provincial legislature. However, Goodale was the only Liberal candidate to receive more than 1,000 votes. [ December 2011 ] The party won 9.99% of the vote in the 1986 provincial election, but only Goodale was elected to the legislature. Goodale ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility in this election, arguing that both the Progressive Conservative and New Democrat (NDP) parties favoured excessive spending policies, typified by their proposals for a Keynesian-style stimulation of the provincial economy through subsidized home improvement and renovation schemes. [ Return to federal politics ] [ Defeated in 1988 election ] Goodale resigned as leader to run for the federal Liberal Party in the 1988 election, but he was narrowly defeated by former Regina mayor Larry Schneider, who later went on to serve briefly in Kim Campbell&apos;s cabinet. Beginning earlier that year and prior to his resignation, Goodale&apos;s executive assistant was Jason Kenney. Kenney would become a Conservative Party of Canada MP in a Calgary riding. Goodale then spent five years in the private sector, working for companies such as the Pioneer Life Assurance Company, Pioneer Lifeco Inc., and Sovereign Life Insurance Co.; he has stated in interviews that he felt his political career had ended. [ In government, 1993-2006 ] Goodale in 2004. Goodale ran again in the 1993 federal election and was elected as part of the Liberals&apos; massive landslide that year. As a member of the new Chrétien cabinet, Goodale was named Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. He has the prenomial &quot; the Honourable &quot; and the postnomial &quot; PC &quot; for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen&apos;s Privy Council for Canada on November 4, 1993. { Biodata } [ December 2011 ] In 1997, he became the Minister of Natural Resources. In 2002, he was named Minister of Public Works and Government Services. The Department of Public Works and Government Services had been plagued by scandals. A close ally of Paul Martin, Goodale was appointed to the senior portfolio of Finance Minister when Martin became Prime Minister on December 12, 2003. In that capacity he tabled two consecutive balanced budgets and launched the Government&apos;s productivity agenda. On December 28, 2005, a letter surfaced from Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli confirming the force was launching a criminal investigation into whether details regarding government tax policies relating to income trust funds were leaked from the Finance Minister&apos;s office. Goodale said he would co-operate completely with any investigation, but would not step aside while the RCMP continued their probe. The investigation deals only with the Department of Finance, and not the minister himself.

[ 2006 Liberal Party leadership election ] After the Liberals&apos; defeat, and Paul Martin&apos;s election night announcement that he would be resigning as party leader, Goodale initially indicated that he was not interested in succeeding Martin in that post. &quot; I do not anticipate ever having to cross that bridge, &quot; he said. &quot; I rule it out. &quot; [ http://www.cbc.ca/sask/story/goodale-liberals060124.html ] [ August 2010 RjwilmsiBot ] On March 16, 2006, however, the Toronto Star reported that Goodale was reconsidering his decision, and stated that he may enter the Liberal leadership election after all.

On November 28, 2006, he endorsed Bob Rae to be the next leader of the Liberal Party. [ December 2011 ] After the third ballot, Bob Rae, who finished third, was eliminated. Goodale then endorsed Stéphane Dion, the eventual winner. Goodale was opposed to David Orchard &apos;s candidacy in the by-election for Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River. { Delacourt, Susan, &quot; Dion accused of snubbing Orchard &quot;, Toronto Star, January 5, 2008 } Dion terminated the nomination contest and appointed Joan Beatty as the candidate. [ Coalition government ] In November 2008, the three opposition parties in the Canadian parliament indicated their intention to defeat the Stephen Harper government in a motion of no confidence, and expressed their desire for the Governor General Michaëlle Jean, to ask a member of the opposition to form a new government. There was initially some speculation that Goodale would become Prime Minister of Canada as leader of the coalition government.

As the NDP surpassed the Liberals in number of seats, that gave them priority in choosing parliamentary offices, and they requested that Goodale forfeit his suite in the coveted Central Block. Many Liberals saw this as a measure of disrespect to Goodale, noting that he had seniority as a former cabinet minister and house leader, and as the Conservatives (who also increased their caucus in the election) had not asked any Liberals to give up their offices.
