McHenry calls U.S. soldier in Iraq a ‘two-bit security guard.’ } — performing security duties in Iraq as &quot; a two-bit security guard &quot; because the contractor denied McHenry access to a gym. We spent the night in the Green Zone, in the poolhouse of one of Saddam’s palaces. A little weird, I got to be honest with you. But I felt safe. And so in the morning, I got up early — not that I make this a great habit — but I went to the gym because I just couldn’t sleep and everything else. Well, sure enough, the guard wouldn’t let me in. Said I didn’t have the correct credentials. It’s 5:00 in the morning. I haven’t had sleep. I was not very happy with this two bit security guard. So you know, I said, “I want to see your supervisor.” Thirty minutes later, the supervisor wasn’t happy with me, they escort me back to my room. It happens.

Earlier that day, McHenry had appeared on CNBC and accused Warren of lying to Congress about her involvement in government inquiries into mortgage servicing. [ Wyatt Edward Decorum Breaks Down at House Hearing http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/25consume.html The New York Times May 24, 2011 ] The meeting had several late and last minute changes, so Warren altered her schedule to accommodate the chair&apos;s request. Around 2:15 pm, McHenry called for a temporary recess to partake in a floor vote. In response, Warren indicated that McHenry&apos;s staff had agreed to the 2:15 pm closing time to allow her ample time to attend another meeting. McHenry replied, &quot; You had no agreement.... You&apos;re making this up, Ms. Warren. This is not the case. &quot; As Warren and some in the audience reacted with surprise, Rep. Elijah Cummings interjected, &quot; Mr. Chairman... I&apos;m trying to be cordial here, but you just accused the lady of lying.

McHenry faced a heavily contested primary in the 10th and bested his closest opponent, Catawba County Sheriff David Huffman, in a primary runoff by only 85 votes. In the general election, McHenry won 64% of the popular vote, defeating Democrat Anne Fischer. However, it was generally thought McHenry&apos;s victory in the primary runoff was tantamount to election in November: his district is considered North Carolina&apos;s most Republican district, having sent Republicans to represent it since 1963. [ 2006 ] [ United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2006 ] In the 2006 election, McHenry defeated Democrat Richard Carsner, gaining almost 62% of the vote on the way to a second term representing the 10th District.

Johnson was considered the strongest and best-funded Democrat to run in the district in over 20 years. In part because of this, the Cook Political Report moved the race from &quot; Safe Republican &quot; to &quot; Likely Republican. &quot; This meant that in Charlie Cook &apos;s opinion, while McHenry still had a considerable advantage, a victory by Johnson could not be ruled out. Shortly after the Cook Political Report&apos;s update, Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report, also a nonpartisan analysis of American politics and elections, addressed the race and indicated his opinion that an upset is unlikely. { How Long Are the House Democrats’ Really Long Shots? } McHenry won the 2008 election, 57.56% to 42.44%.
