The condition appears to have been first described in the American medical literature by Drs. Samia Temtamy and John Rogers in 1976 [ Temtamy Samia Rogers Macrodactyly, hemihypertrophy, and connective tissue nevi: Report of a new syndrome and review of the literature The Journal of Pediatrics 1976 December 89 6 924–927 993918 July 31, 2011 ] [ Opitz John Jorde Hamartoma Syndromes, Exome Sequencing, and a Protean Puzzle The New England Journal of Medicine July 27, 2011 21793737 July 31, 2011 10.1056/NEJMe1107384 365 7 661–3 ] Dr. Michael Cohen described it in 1979, [ Cohen MM, Hayden PW A newly recognized hamartomatous syndrome Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 15 5B 291–6 1979 118782 ] only a few more than 200 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with estimates that about 120 people are currently alive with the condition. { Woman&apos;s 11-stone legs may be lost at } { BBC } As attenuated forms of the disease may exist, there could be many people with Proteus syndrome who remain undiagnosed. Those most readily diagnosed are also the most severely disfigured. [ Presentation ] Proteus syndrome causes an overgrowth of skin, bones, muscles, fatty tissues, and blood and lymphatic vessels. Proteus syndrome is a progressive condition wherein children are usually born without any obvious deformities. Tumors of skin and bone growths appear as they age. The severity and locations of these various asymmetrical growths vary greatly but typically the skull, one or more limbs, and soles of the feet will be affected. There is a risk of premature death in affected individuals due to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism caused by the vessel malformations that are associated with this disorder. Because of carrying excess weight and enlarged limbs, arthritis and muscle pain may also be symptoms — as is the case for Mandy Sellars, a woman living with a form of Proteus syndrome. [ Neglia Ashley http://www.aolhealth.com/bio/ashley-neglia Living With Proteus syndrome AOL Health May 2009 http://www.aolhealth.com/health/proteus-syndrome June 2009 ] Further risks may occur due to the mass of extra tissue. The disorder itself does not uniformly cause learning impairments: the distribution of intelligence deficits among sufferers of Proteus syndrome appears higher than that of the general population, although this is difficult to determine with statistical significance. [ Turner Joyce Cohen, Biesecker Reassessment of the Proteus syndrome literature: application of diagnostic criteria to published cases American Journal of Medical Genetics Oct 1, 2004 2004 130A 2 111–122 15372514 July 31, 2011 10.1002/ajmg.a.30327 ] In addition, the presence of visible deformity may have a negative effect on the social experiences of the sufferer, causing cognitive and social deficits. Afflicted individuals are at increased risk for developing certain tumors including unilateral ovarian cystadenomas, testicular tumors, meningiomas, and monomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland. [ March 2009 ] [ Genetics ] Proteus syndrome is an overgrowth disorder caused by a rare genetic mosaicism. A genetic mutation during embryonic develop gives rise to overgrowth in a subset of the individual&apos;s cells In 2011 researchers determined the cause of Proteus syndrome. In 26 of 29 patients who met strict clinical criteria for the disorder Lindhurst et al. identified an activating mutation in AKT1 kinase in a mosaic state gene. { Lindhurst MJ, Sapp JC, Teer JK, Johnston JJ, Finn EM, Peters K, Turner J, Cannons JL, Bick D, Blakemore L, Blumhorst C, Brockmann K, Calder P, Cherman N, Deardorff MA, Everman DB, Golas G, Greenstein RM, Kato BM, Keppler-Noreuil KM, Kuznetsov SA, Miyamoto RT, Newman K, Ng D, O&apos;Brien K, Rothenberg S, Schwartzentruber DJ, Singhal V, Tirabosco R, Upton J, Wientroub S, Zackai EH, Hoag K, Whitewood-Neal T, Robey PG, Schwartzberg PL, Darling TN, Tosi LL, Mullikin JC, Biesecker LG (2011) A Mosaic Activating Mutation in AKT1 Associated with the Proteus Syndrome. N Engl J Med } This mutation was not present in more than 1,000 persons who were unaffected by this disorder. Previous research had suggested the condition linked to PTEN on chromosome 10, [ Smith JM, Kirk EP, Theodosopoulos G, et al. Germline mutation of the tumour suppressor PTEN in Proteus syndrome J.

The lesions appear to be distributed in a mosaic manner.

However, careful research has shown that Merrick actually suffered from Proteus syndrome.
