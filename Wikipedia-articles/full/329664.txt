[ April 2010 ] Television was introduced in Finland in 1957. Color television started in 1969. Prior to 1986, YLE monopolized the Finnish television. All terrestrial analogue stations stopped broadcasting on September 1, 2007 after introducing digital television; cable providers were allowed to continue analog broadcasting in their networks until March 1, 2008. Typically, foreign-language content is subtitled, retaining the original language soundtrack. Foreign programming intended for children is, however, usually dubbed into one of the national languages. Regardless of the intended audience, many shows receive a Finnish and/or Swedish title which is used in programme schedules. [ Digital terrestrial ] [ Digital terrestrial television in Finland ] Digital terrestrial television was launched on August 21, 2001. The analogue networks continued its broadcasts alongside the digital ones until September 1, 2007, when they were shut down nationwide. Before the analogue switchoff, the terrestrial network had three multiplex es : MUX A, MUX B and MUX C. MUX A contained the channels of the public broadcaster Yleisradio and MUX B was shared between the two commercial broadcasters: MTV3 and Nelonen. MUX C contained channels of various other broadcasters. After the analogue closedown, a fourth multiplex named MUX E was launched. In addition the free-to-air broadcasts, two companies are providing encryption cards for pay television: Canal Digital and PlusTV. Canal Digital was the first to launch, originally only offering four Canal+ channels (the Disney Channel was added later on). PlusTV was launched in November 2006, originally only broadcasting MTV3 Max and Subtv Juniori (later on adding Subtv Leffa and Urheilu+kanava ). Both packages got more channels with the launch of MUX E in September 2007: SVT Europa and MTV3 Fakta was added to PlusTV and KinoTV was added to Canal Digital, while Discovery Channel, Eurosport, MTV Finland and Nickelodeon were added to both packages. September 2007 also saw the launch of the SveaTV package in Ostrobothnia which broadcasts channels from Sweden. On the digital platform, subtitling isn&apos;t a part of the video stream, but is delivered as a separate data stream, which allows subtitling in multiple languages and the option to remove subtitles. Due to technical problems with the subtitles, many people cancelled their television licenses. [ was this the main problem? May 2009 ] This meant that YLE had to make drastic budget cuts. The digital channel YLE Extra was closed on December 31, 2007 and was replaced by YLE TV1+, a simulcast of TV1 with subtitles included in the video stream. TV1+ was closed on August 4, 2008 due to its low viewing share.
