He was a Democrat. Born in Lubbock, Texas, Leland attended Wheatley High School in Houston, Texas { &quot; Distinguished HISD Alumni, &quot; } { Houston Independent School District } and obtained a bachelor&apos;s from Texas Southern University in Houston. In 1972, Texas for the first time allowed its State House of Representatives and Senate seats to be elected as single-member districts. Soon after the decision, five minority candidates (dubbed the &quot; People&apos;s Five &quot; ), including eventual winners Leland, Craig Washington and Benny Reyes ran for district seats in the Texas House of Representatives, a first for a state that, although Barbara Jordan had been a state senator, had not seen any African-American state representatives since Reconstruction. Leland remained in the state legislature until he was elected to Congress in 1979. He remained in Congress until his death, being reelected to the United States House of Representatives every two years. { George Bush Intercontinental Airport is named after Leland } Leland was an effective advocate on hunger and public health issues. In 1984 Leland established the congressional select committee on Hunger and initiated a number of programs designed to assuage the famine crises that plagued Ethiopia and Sudan through much of the 1980s. Leland pioneered many afro-centrtic cultural norms in Washington which included wearing a dashiki and African style hats. { Leland, Mickey. } { Handbook of Texas Online.

A large number of other government programs, fellowships, and academic organizations have also been named in his memory.
