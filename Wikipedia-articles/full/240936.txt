[ 1998 9 21 ] [ 2007 5 14 ] { 9 } { 207 } { List of The King of Queens episodes } { Everybody Loves Raymond } { http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/kingofqueens/ } The King of Queens is an American sitcom that originally ran on CBS from September 21, 1998, to May 14, 2007. This show was produced by Hanley Productions and CBS Productions (1998–2006), CBS Paramount Television (2006–2007), in association with Columbia Pictures Television (1998–1999) Columbia TriStar Television (1999–2002), and Sony Pictures Television (2002–2007). It was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, USA. After the series finale broadcast on May 14, 2007, The King of Queens became the last American live action sitcom that premiered in the 1990s to end its run. { http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165581/trivia } [ Plot ] Doug and Carrie Heffernan ( Kevin James and Leah Remini ) share their home at 3121 Aberdeen Street in Rego Park, Queens, New York (hence the show&apos;s title), { The } { exterior shots of the Heffernans&apos; house have been made in } { Cliffside Park, New Jersey, see } [ http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2009/10/30/the-king-of-queens-house/ The King of Queens House October 30, 2009 ] with Carrie&apos;s oddball dad, Arthur Spooner ( Jerry Stiller ). [ http://cbs.seenon.com/detail.php?p%3D43900%26amp%3Bv%3Dcbs-kingofqueens King of Queens – The Complete Eighth Season CBSStore.com 2009-05-30 ] Doug, who makes a living as a delivery driver for the International Parcel Service (IPS), spends most of his time at his home with his wife Carrie. Carrie works as a secretary for a law firm in midtown Manhattan and later is a secretary for a real estate firm. This is complicated by Arthur, who can be quite a handful—so much so that they hired a dog walker, Holly ( Nicole Sullivan ), to walk him along with her canine charges in the local park. Doug hangs with his advice-giving buddies Deacon Palmer ( Victor Williams ), Spencer Olchin ( Patton Oswalt ), Richie Iannucci ( Larry Romano season 1–3) and Danny Heffernan ( Gary Valentine season 3 onwards). Most scenes usually take place in the Heffernans&apos; home, but other common locations include Doug and Carrie&apos;s workplaces, the restaurant &quot; Cooper&apos;s &quot; and the residences of friends and family. While locations seen during the theme-song were filmed in areas surrounding New York, the series was filmed in California. How and when Doug and Carrie first met is unclear. In one episode, a flashback episode of how they first met, Doug and his friend Richie are bouncers at a club and meet Carrie and one of Carrie&apos;s girlfriends who are partying at the club. The girls go back to the guy&apos;s apartment to hook up. But, in another episode &apos;Road Rayge&apos;, Doug and Carrie are on their couch watching TV and the song Boogie Oogie Oogie comes on the TV show they are watching. Carrie asks Doug to dance, because she says it&apos;s their song. Doug doesn&apos;t remember and Carrie says Doug asked her to dance to the song at Kim Ianola&apos;s birthday party when they were in Junior High School. So, they would have had to have known each other while attending that school or at an earlier time. In the same episode where Carrie and Doug were showed to have first met, Doug also met Deacon while pretending to work at IPS so Carrie would sleep with him. In a later episode, it was implied that they all went to high school together, as Kelly and Carrie were said to have slept with the same guy neither husband knew of until the day of the guy&apos;s wedding. [ Cast and characters ] Douglas &quot; Doug &quot; Heffernan (played by Kevin James ): Doug is an average parcel delivery man who exhibits a rather light-hearted and sometimes immature mentality. Doug&apos;s birth date is February 9, 1965. According to what Doug&apos;s parents revealed to him in episode 5x23 &quot; Dog Shelter &quot;, he was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His misadventures are often fueled by his childish and immature mannerisms as well as his love of food. These basic desires often cause him to think of strange, intricate schemes in order to get what he wants, although they always manage to fall through in the end causing constant squabbles between him and Carrie. Doug&apos;s tendency to give in to his temptations, despite promising Carrie otherwise, is another common reason why the two have disagreements. He generally enjoys the simple pleasures of watching sports and playing poker with his friends. Doug is also a New York Mets, New York Knicks, New York Jets and New York Rangers fan. He is incredibly uncomfortable with change and will go to ridiculous lengths to avoid any kind of change in his little world, whether it&apos;s coping with his childhood dog&apos;s death (who in fact has died several times and was replaced by his parents with different dogs of the same breed), or with a simple change in his mother&apos;s recipe for lemon squares (artificial to natural flavoring). Unlike many married protagonists of sitcoms, Doug has rarely been attracted to other women. Due to his immature and selfish nature, he is constantly at odds with his wife, friends and co-workers. Carrie Heffernan (played by Leah Remini ): Carrie is Doug&apos;s beautiful yet sarcastic and sharp-tongued wife. She never finished college and is employed as a hard-working legal secretary. Her constant attempts to make their relationship and daily lives more romantic and meaningful causes Doug endless frustration, as Doug prefers things to be simple and to have as few restrictions on his life as possible. The more perceptive and insightful of the couple, Carrie often pushes Doug to make more of himself and improve his morals but can be just as unscrupulous as he. Carrie has a tough attitude and is even physically abusive to Doug periodically. She has been judged by Holly and Doug as being scary (particularly when she&apos;s upset). During a flashback, Carrie finds that she is usually happier (she describes herself as never being truly happy) when others are miserable. Although Carrie admonishes Doug for his lazy and often self-centered behaviour, she has proven herself to be even more selfish at times, with little patience for others&apos; problems or tolerance for their quirks. Many episodes have shown the couple trying to escape some socially unpleasant situation at Carrie&apos;s behest with it resulting in her abandoning Doug who, being the push-over, is left to fend for himself; she once left him lost in a forest to go have lunch, while another time she left him at an odd Bed and Breakfast run by an eccentric couple while she checked into a hotel and went dancing. Carrie&apos;s best friend is Deacon&apos;s wife, Kelly Palmer. Arthur Spooner (played by Jerry Stiller ): Carrie&apos;s widowed father Arthur, who has been married three times and then for the fourth time to Spence&apos;s mother during the final season, is the classic oddball of the family. He lives in the basement of the Heffernan house because he accidentally set fire to his own uninsured home, burning it to the ground saving only his hotplate, which started the fire, in the pilot episode. Arthur is mostly known for his incoherent irascible outbursts. He tells a lot of questionable stories of what he claims he&apos;s been through in his past. Arthur is usually seen causing regular chaos and getting on someone&apos;s bad side with his antics, craziness, and obnoxious behaviors. Carrie and Doug sometimes have trouble finding some time alone just for the two of them because Arthur tends to get in the way. Even with all of his bad behavior, deep down Arthur has a heart of gold, which always manages to shine through, causing Doug and Carrie to feel guilty about yelling at him in the end. Arthur also tries to cause trouble with Doug&apos;s friends. He especially picks on Spence, but also (unsuccessfully) tries it on Deacon, who often refers to him as &quot; the old man. &quot; Deacon Palmer (played by Victor Williams ): Doug&apos;s best friend. Deacon is the more responsible of the two, in addition to being the classic &quot; family man. &quot; He is tall and athletic. Deacon and his wife Kelly have two sons named Major and Kirby. He&apos;s often seen hanging out with Doug, whether it&apos;s at their lunch break, over the weekend, or for a family gathering. Although he is often experiencing relationship problems, Deacon always has time to chill out and have fun. He will often help Doug plan elaborate schemes to fool Carrie, but rarely likes to get involved in the scheme himself. It is mentioned in a number of episodes that Deacon attended St. John&apos;s University in Queens, but whether or not he graduated is never referenced. In the first season episode &quot; Best Man, &quot; Deacon mentions having served in the National Guard. Spencer &quot; Spence &quot; Olchin (played by Patton Oswalt ): Spence, another friend of Doug, is often viewed as the nerd of the group. Not only is he very paranoid, he also takes an interest in science fiction, fantasy movies, and comic book conventions—interests that his friends do not share. Spence&apos;s birthday is February 14. He is of Albanian heritage, and works as a subway token collector. In one episode, he is a &quot; house boy &quot; for Deacon and Kelly. His character is based largely on the actor who plays him, Patton Oswalt. Spence demonstrates intelligence and capability in a variety of pursuits, but he is haunted by his family history, his domineering and unstable mother, and his inability to assert himself with others. Numerous episodes mention that Spence is asthmatic (a burden he shares with Danny) and allergic to peanuts. In the season eight episode &quot; Hartford Wailer &quot;, Spence is said to be from Ottawa. In the series&apos; penultimate episode, &quot; Single Spaced, &quot; Spence becomes obsessed with romancing Carrie when it appears she and Doug will divorce. [ February 2012 ] Daniel &quot; Danny &quot; Heffernan (played by Gary Valentine ): Danny Heffernan is Doug&apos;s cousin, and he is also seen hanging out with Doug, Spence, and Deacon. In the show&apos;s early seasons Doug has a negative view of Danny, bordering on hate. However as the show progressed, they become friends and co-workers, and regularly hang out along with Deacon and Spence. Danny even becomes Spence&apos;s roommate in a small apartment. The two often looked as if they were involved in a romantic relationship together, and they fought like a married couple. At one point, they actually got legally married in order to get a free TV from a sales pitch after they discovered only married couples were eligible. Danny also used to own a pizza place, and he is divorced. He once had the nickname &quot; Stumpy, &quot; which was given to him by Doug. As shown in the episodes &quot; Silent Mite &quot; and &quot; Paint Misbehavin,&apos; &quot; Danny has asthma and uses an inhaler. Gary Valentine and Kevin James are brothers in real life. They both created last names for acting. Valentine is their father&apos;s middle name. Holly Shumpert (2001–2006) (played by Nicole Sullivan ): Holly is a cheerful, yet insecure dog-walker hired by Doug and Carrie to walk Arthur. She is often seen arriving at the Heffernan house to pick up Arthur, but is also a family friend of the Heffernans. She is often viewed as a bit strange because of her habits and the men she dates (not to mention her habit of over-drinking, to which she openly confesses). In one episode, Holly asks Carrie (referring to her inability to find a boyfriend), &quot; What am I doing wrong? I give them money, I let them stay at my house. &quot; Overall, however, Holly is a gentle soul, especially when she puts up with Arthur&apos;s antics. Holly was written out of the series at the end of season eight, but she later returned one last time for the series finale. Richard &quot; Richie &quot; Ianucchi (1998–2001) (played by Larry Romano ): Richie was one of Doug&apos;s closest friends, but was quietly written out of the show in season three due to Romano&apos;s request to work on another sitcom. During that season, he only appeared in one episode, called &quot; Paint Misbehavin.&apos; &quot; He mostly addressed Doug as &quot; Moose &quot;. Richie was known as the ladies&apos; man among Doug&apos;s friends, even admitting to sleeping with Doug&apos;s sister. Richie was an FDNY firefighter. He also was somewhat of a con artist. His last appearance on the show was in the episode &quot; Paint Misbehavin &quot; in which he has sex (offscreen) with Doug&apos;s sister Stephanie ( Ricki Lake ) and afterwards she promises to call him later, although she has no intentions to. He was also briefly seen in a few clips during the flashback montage at the end of the series finale. Sara Spooner (1998) (played by Lisa Rieffel ): Sara was Carrie&apos;s younger half-sister who was constructed as an irresponsible aspiring actress. She appeared in only 5 episodes (episodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) and then disappeared without any explanation. She was only mentioned one other time (although not by name) in episode 53 by Doug as an excuse to his boss to get out of performing a roast. After the show became more popular, Kevin James was asked to explain what happened to Sara during an interview. According to James, the producers could not think of any storylines to develop Rieffel&apos;s character, so she was discontinued. During the pilot she was on camera for roughly half the episode. However in the other episodes where she was included, her character did not have much to say or do. Subsequent dialogue suggests that Sara Spooner never existed, and that Carrie is an only child. This is an example of &quot; Chuck Cunningham Syndrome &quot; (see Happy Days ). [ Recurring characters ] Kelly Palmer (1998–2001; 2003–2007), Deacon&apos;s wife (played by Merrin Dungey ): Kelly is Carrie&apos;s best friend. She has two children with Deacon. Kelly and Deacon have experienced some serious relationship problems, much more serious than the petty arguments between Doug and Carrie. On one occasion, Deacon mentions being hit in the head with a frying pan. She was absent from the show in 2002 because she needed to take a break from the series. Lou Ferrigno (2000–2007) (played by himself): Ferrigno is the actor known for his role on The Incredible Hulk. Ferrigno and his wife are neighbors of the Heffernans. A running gag on the series is that the neighbors (including the Heffernans) are fascinated by him and it gets on his nerves. Other characters often make reference to his previous role as the Hulk. For example, at one point Doug is angry and Lou tries to calm him down; Doug retorts with the famous line from the Hulk series &quot; Don&apos;t make me angry, you wouldn&apos;t like me when I am angry. &quot; Raymond &quot; Ray &quot; Barone (played by Ray Romano ): Doug&apos;s Long Island friend. This character is tied-in from the series Everybody Loves Raymond. This has led to guest appearances from four actors from the series who play Ray&apos;s wife, mother, father and brother in that series. Also to be noted, all episodes with Ray Romano as Ray Barone play Ray&apos;s name into the title episode (e.g. &quot; Road Rayge &quot; and &quot; Raygin&apos; Bulls &quot; ).

For most of its run it was a Monday night staple, competing with shows such as the long-running drama 7th Heaven. In 2003, when scheduled against The West Wing and Nanny 911, it dropped slightly in the ratings. The final episode aired on May 14, 2007, which made The King of Queens one of the last longest-running sitcoms of the 1990s–2000s (decade). The show is currently in syndication worldwide and airs on TBS and TV Land in the United States and on TVTropolis and OMNI in Canada. In Sweden, and the UK it runs on the ComedyCentral network. According to the DVD commentary of the Pilot episode, the character of Arthur was conceived with Jerry Stiller in mind, but he initially turned down the role. Veteran comedian Jack Carter was then cast and a pilot was shot. Soon afterwards, Stiller changed his mind and took the part, which required reshooting of scenes featuring Carter. The King of Queens was partly inspired by the classic television sitcom The Honeymooners, as the characters of Doug and Carrie are based on the Kramden couple, with similar mannerisms and deadpan expressions. In a 2001 episode of the show ( &quot; Inner Tube &quot; ), the show pays homage to The Honeymooners, as a distraught Doug dreams that he is Ralph Kramden, his wife Carrie is Alice Kramden, and his friend Deacon is Ed Norton. The sequence was filmed in black-and-white and the audio quality (including the audience) matches a 1950s style. The King of Queens was one of the first series to broadcast in 16:9 high-definition video, broadcasting in 1080i. At the time of the show&apos;s premiere, CBS had just regained broadcasting rights to the NFL, and was an early adopter of HDTV technology as a result, allowing The King of Queens to broadcast with the technology. [ Theme song and opening sequences ] The season one main opening was a simple eight-second sequence which showed the window of a subway train with moving through and quickly stopping at the original show logo, which then peeled off to reveal the names of the show&apos;s creators. Starting with season two, the show added a new theme song called &quot; Baby All My Life I Will Be Driving Home To You &quot; which was written by series writers Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, composed by Jonathan Wolff and Scott Clausen, and performed by Billy Vera and the Beaters. An instrumental version was used as the closing theme during season two, but was replaced in season three with a new closing theme composed by Kurt Farquhar. The opening credits from seasons two through nine featured an opening shot of Doug getting into an IPS truck, which then cuts to a long shot of a bridge, where he drives under a bridge onto which the show&apos;s logo is digitally placed, as if it&apos;s a street sign. It then cuts to scenes of Doug, Carrie and Arthur spending time around Queens. In the season two sequence, Kevin James&apos; starring credit was placed over a shot of the Brooklyn Bridge with the Manhattan skyline, but was re-edited after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that felled the World Trade Center. Two short versions of the sequence exist: in original airings where the opening was shortened due to time constraints and in some syndicated airings, the opening featured the shot of the IPS truck going under the bridge, then to the final shot of the credits where Doug and Carrie get ices at the Lemon Ice King of Corona on 108th St in Queens. The second version used in U.S. syndicated airings since 2007 simply features the first eight seconds of the full sequence with the opening establishing shots of Queens placed before the truck scene. In syndicated airings of season one episodes that have aired in the U.S. since the fall of 2007, this version replaced the standard season one sequence in all episodes for unknown reasons.
