[ 2010Census_prelim ] { 31459 } [ 2002Census ] { 1231 } { 49638 } { http://www.admmozhaysk.ru/ } { May 2010 } Mozhaysk { Alternative transliterations include Mozhaisk, Mozhajsk, Mozhaĭsk, and Možajsk. } ( [ Можайск məˈʐajsk ] ) is a town and the administrative center of Mozhaysky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia, located [ 110 km us ] to the west from the Russian capital, on the historic road leading to Smolensk and then to Poland. Population: [ 31,388 31,459 30,735 ] The town was first mentioned in 1231 as an appanage of Chernigov; it was named after the river Mozhai or Mozhaya, whose name is of Baltic origin (cf. Lithuanian mažoja &apos;small&apos;). { Е. М. Поспелов. &quot; Географические названия мира &quot;. Москва, 1998. Стр.  272 } Later it was an important stronghold of the Smolensk dynasty, one time owned by Feodor the Black. The Muscovites seized it in 1303, but in the course of the following century had serious troubles defending it against Algirdas of Lithuania. The principality was usually held by a younger brother of the ruling Grand Duke of Moscow, until the practice was dropped in 1493. In 1562, the Treaty of Mozhaysk was signed there. Mozhaysk continued to defend the Western approaches to Moscow during Napoleon&apos;s invasion of Russia and World War II (during which it was captured by the Germans on October 16, 1941). The great Battle of Borodino took place [ 12 km mi us ] from the city. Town status was granted to it in 1708. The first stone cathedral was built in the kremlin in the early 14th century; in 1849, it was demolished stone by stone and then reconstructed exactly as it used to be. A larger blood-red cathedral in the Gothic Revival style was completed in 1814. The church of St.  Joachim and Anna preserves some parts from the early 15th century. Another important landmark is the Luzhetsky monastery, founded in 1408 by Saint Ferapont and rebuilt in brick in the 16th century. The monastery cathedral, erected during the reign of Basil III, was formerly known for its frescoes, ascribed to Dionisy &apos;s circle. [ In popular culture ] The fact that Mozhaysk is beyond the 101st km zone outside of Moscow and was frequently the last major stop on the way to the capital, led to the &quot; push beyond Mozhay &quot; expression ( [ ru загнать за Можай ], zagnat&apos; za Mozhay), which literally means &quot; push (people, enemy) away (from Moscow) further than Mozhaysk. &quot; { Загнать за Можай (in Russian). } [ International relations ] [ List of twin towns and sister cities in Russia ] [ Twin towns/sister cities ] Mozhaysk is twinned with: [ France ] [ Germany ] [ Bulgaria ] [ Finland ] [ Ukraine ] [ Poland ] [ Belarus ] Château-du-Loir, France Drochtersen, Germany Etropole, Bulgaria Lohja, Finland Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine Ujazd, Poland Vileyka, Belarus [ References ] [ External links ] Unofficial website of Mozhaysk Category:Cities and towns in Moscow Oblast ar:موجايسك az:Mojaysk be:Горад Мажайск bg:Можайск cs:Možajsk de:Moschaisk et:Možaisk es:Mozhaisk eo:Moĵajsk fa:موژایسک fr:Mojaïsk ko:모자이스크 it:Možajsk la:Mosaiscum lt:Možaiskas ja:モジャイスク no:Mozjajsk nn:Mozjajsk pl:Możajsk pt:Mojaisk ru:Можайск sah:Можайскай sk:Možajsk fi:Možaisk tl:Mozhaysk tg:Можайск war:Mozhaysk diq:Mozhaysk zh:莫扎伊斯克
