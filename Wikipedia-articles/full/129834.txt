[ History ] Ohio and Erie Canal in Massillon during the turn of the century Russell &amp; Company Steam Tractor Massillon State Hospital in early 1900&apos;s [ Port of Massillon ] The original settlement of Kendal was founded in 1812 by Thomas Rotch, a Quaker originally of New Bedford, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut. James Duncan of New Hampshire first settled in Kendal before recording the plat for Massillon in December 6, 1826. Duncan, known as the city&apos;s founder, named the town after Jean Baptiste Massillon, a French Catholic bishop. { Stark County Recorder&apos;s Office, Plats, Book 5, Page 17 } The town plat was established along the east bank of the Tuscarawas River, which was the surveyed route for the Ohio and Erie Canal being constructed to connect Lake Erie with the Ohio River. The canal section spanning from Cleveland to Massillon was completed in 1828. Massillon quickly became a major port town along the canal route, known as the Port of Massillon, following the canal&apos;s completion in the 1832. The first telegraph lines would reach Massillon in 1847, and the Ohio &amp; Pennsylvania Railroad would extend its rails to Massillon in 1852. Massillon incorporated as a village in 1853, which included the towns of Kendal to the east and Brookfield to the west (platted in 1835). In 1868, Massillon incorporated as a city when the populated reached 5,000. [ C. M. Russell &amp; amp; Company ] The C. M. Russell &amp; Company, formed in 1842 by Charles. M. Russell and his brothers, Nahum Russell and Clement Russell, manufactured threshing machines and other agricultural implements in Massillon. The company began producing train cars in 1852 and incorporated in 1864 as Russell &amp; Company Inc. In 1884, Russell &amp; Company begain producing its famed steam traction engines and quickly came one of the largest producers of industrial and agricultural equipment. The company began producing gasoline powered equipment in 1915 but ended production in 1924. { http://russellcollectors.org/articles/russell-company-history.asp } [ Massillon Bridge Company ] The Massillon Iron Bridge Company was founded by Joseph Davenport in 1869 after moving to Massillon from Boston to work at the C. M. Russell &amp; Company. Davenport also invented and built the first locomotive &quot; cowcatcher &quot; and cab in Massillon. The company incorporated in 1887 as the The Massillon Bridge Company. The Massillon Bridge Company designed and built steel truss bridges up through the early 1900&apos;s, many of which stand today. [ Massillon State Hospital ] The Massillon State Hospital for the Insane opened in 1898 on 240 acres of land given to the state of Ohio for the purpose of constructing the hospital.

The name of the company was changed to the Jewel Motor Car Company but the company eventually ceased production in 1909. { Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950) } [ Steel Era ] Although steel making and fabrication is found throughout its history, some say Massillon&apos;s steel age didn&apos;t start until 1909 when the first sheet of steel was rolled at the Massillon Rolling Mill Company. Massillon Rolling merged into the Central Steel Company in 1914, and lit its first open hearth furnace in 1915. Central Steel eventually became known as the Central Alloy Steel Company. In 1930, Central Steel was purchased by the Cleveland based Republic Steel, along with Central Steel&apos;s other Massillon divisions including Massillon Union Drawn Steel and its stainless steel division Enduro Stainless. Republic Steel became the third largest steel company in the world, with its Massillon operations employing nearly one-half of the city&apos;s workforce by 1959. Massillon&apos;s steel era came to an end in 1984 when Republic Steel was purchased by LTV Steel and most of the Massillon operations were sold or shuttered. [ Massillon Steel Joist ] Stanley Macomber designed the open-web steel joist in 1921 while working for Massillon’s Central Steel Company. Macomber left Central Steel and founded the Massillon Steel Joist Co. in 1923. His open-web steel joist, patented in 1924, was known as the Massillon Steel Joist. Macomber&apos;s invention was a revolutionary assembly of steel joists with a top slab used to support of floors, ceilings and roofs. The basis of Macomber&apos;s steel joist design is still used today. Stanley Macomber was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame in 2011. { http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/440.html } Lincoln Highway (US-30) looking east into Downtown Massillon, 1966 [ Lincoln Highway ] Lincoln Highway, the first US highway to run from coast to coast, was completed in 1913 and followed Main Street through the center of Massillon. Main Street was eventually renamed Lincoln Way in recognition of the new federal highway. In 1928, the federal government renamed Lincoln Highway to US 30. A controlled access freeway was constructed in 1971, bypassing US-30 around to the city&apos;s most southern part. The old Lincoln Highway that runs through Massillon and Canton was reassigned as State Route 172. Massillon Museum [ Massillon Museum ] The Massillon Museum was established in 1933 in order to preserve the city&apos;s rich history. The museum was accredited in 1972 by the American Association of Museums and is currently located downtown in the historic Gensemer Brothers Dry Goods building.

The Immel Circus is one of the museum&apos;s most interesting collections. The 100-square foot miniature circus contains 2,620 pieces: thirty-six elephants, 186 horses, 102 assorted animals, ninety-one wagons, seven tents, and 2,207 people. Most of the pieces were hand-carved by Dr. Robert Immel of Massillon using tools from his dental practice. { http://www.massillonmuseum.org/ } LKF - The unincorporated town of Massillon, Iowa was named after the city in 1854. [ Little Steel Strike ] Massillon was a site where one of the most tragic instances of anti-union violence in the history of the United States occurred. The Steel Workers Organizing Committee begain an attempt to organize workers at Republic Steel in the spring of 1937, following the unionizing of workers at the country&apos;s two largest steel companies US Steel and Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel. In retaliation, Republic Steel expelled over 1000 union supporters at plants in Canton and Massillon. On May 26, the union eventually called for all workers at Republic Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and Inland Steel (together known as Little Steel) to strike in response to the treatment of workers in Massillon and Canton. On the night of July 11, 1937, a car failed to dim its headlights as it approached a police barracade near a picket line at one of the Massillon plants. City police assumed the worst and without warning opened fire with rifles and shotguns. Police then used this infraction to raid a peaceful crowd that was gathered in front of the union headquarters. Police pumped tear gas canisters and opened fire into the fleeing crowd. Joined by National Guardsmen, the police destroyed the union hall and arrested every suspected unionist they could find. Three men were killed and hundreds were injured during this incident. { Zieger, Robert H. The CIO, 1935-1955. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1995.

Coxey, Sr. sometimes known as General Coxey (April 16, 1854 – May 18, 1951) of Massillon, Ohio, was an American politician, who ran for elective office several times in Ohio. He twice led Coxey&apos;s Army in 1894 and 1914, consisting of a group of unemployed men that he led on marches from Massillon, Ohio to Washington, D.C. to present a &quot; Petition in Boots &quot; demanding that the United States Congress allocate funds to create jobs for the unemployed. Although his march failed, Coxey&apos;s Army was an early attempt to arouse political interest in an issue that grew in importance until the Social Security Act of 1935 encouraged the establishment of state unemployment insurance programs.Jacob Coxey was elected Mayor of Massillon in 1931. [ Football ] [ Professional Football ] While the first players known to be paid to play football are believed to have played for club teams in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, perhaps the first great professional football rivalry was between the Massillon Tigers and Canton Bulldogs from 1903 to 1906 and 1915 to 1919. This rivalry predates both the NFL and the aforementioned rivalry between the Massillon and Canton high schools which continue to use the nicknames of these early professional teams. The Professional Football Researchers Association (PFRA) web site includes articles about the early years of this rivalry, [ http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/03-07-068.pdf The Ohio League 2008-06-11 Braunwart Bob Carroll, Bob 1981 PDF The Coffin Corner Professional Football Researchers Association ] as well as articles about the history of football through the 1970s.
