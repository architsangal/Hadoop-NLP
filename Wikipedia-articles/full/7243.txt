{ Lakeland, Florida. } { Lakeland, Florida, United States. } { CallWeb Internet-based survey software. } A call centre or call center is a centralised office used for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests by telephone. A call centre is operated by a company to administer incoming product support or information inquiries from consumers. Outgoing calls for telemarketing, clientele, product services, and debt collection are also made. In addition to a call centre, collective handling of letters, fax es, live chat, and e-mails at one location is known as a contact centre. A call centre is often operated through an extensive open workspace for call centre agents, with work stations that include a computer for each agent, a telephone set/ headset connected to a telecom switch, and one or more supervisor stations. It can be independently operated or networked with additional centres, often linked to a corporate computer network, including mainframes, microcomputer s and LANs. Increasingly, the voice and data pathways into the centre are linked through a set of new technologies called computer telephony integration (CTI). A contact centre, also known as customer interaction centre is a central point of any organization from which all customer contacts are managed. Through contact centres, valuable information about company are routed to appropriate people, contacts to be tracked and data to be gathered. It is generally a part of company’s customer relationship management (CRM). Today, customers contact companies by calling, emailing, chatting online, visiting websites, faxing, and even instant messaging. [ Technology ] Call centre technology is subject to improvements and innovations. Some of these technologies include speech recognition software to allow computers to handle first level of customer support, text mining and natural language processing to allow better customer handling, agent training by automatic mining of best practices from past interactions, support automation and many other technologies to improve agent productivity and customer satisfaction.

A typical call centre telephone. Note: no handset, phone is for headset use only. Premise-based Call Centre TechnologyHistorically, call centres have been built on PBX equipment that is owned and hosted by the call centre operator. The PBX might provide functions such as Automatic Call Distribution, Interactive Voice Response, and skills-based routing. The call centre operator would be responsible for the maintenance of the equipment and necessary software upgrades as released by the vendor. Virtual Call Centre Technology [ http://www.springerlink.com/content/kapq5p85xnhrwe5b/ M. Popovic and V. Kovacevic An Approach to Internet-Based Virtual Call Center Implementation University of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia ] With the advent of the Software as a service technology delivery model, the virtual call centre has emerged. In a virtual call centre model, the call centres operator does not own, operate or host the equipment that the call centre runs on. Instead, they subscribe to a service for a monthly or annual fee with a service provider that hosts the call centre telephony equipment in their own data centre. Such a vendor may host many call centres on their equipment. Agents connect to the vendor&apos;s equipment through traditional PSTN telephone lines, or over Voice over IP. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor&apos;s data centre, rather than at the call centre operator&apos;s premise. The vendor&apos;s telephony equipment then connects the calls to the call centre operator&apos;s agents. Virtual Call Centre Technology allows people to work from home, instead of in a traditional, centralised, call centre location, which increasingly allows people with physical or other disabilities that prevent them from leaving the house, to work.

Joachim Computer Technology Opens a World of Work to Disabled People New York Times ] A predictive dialling system running out of numbers to dial. Cloud Computing for Call CentresCloud computing for call centres extends cloud computing to Software as a service, or hosted, on-demand call centres by providing application programming interfaces (APIs) on the call centre cloud computing platform that allow call centre functionality to be integrated with cloud-based Customer relationship management, such as Salesforce.com or Oracle CRM and leads management and other applications. The APIs typically provide programmatic access to two key groups of features in the call centre platform: Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) APIs provide developers with access to basic telephony controls and sophisticated call handling on the call centre platform from a separate application. Configuration APIs provide programmatic control of administrative functions of the call centre platform which are typically accessed by a human administrator through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). [ Dynamics ] Calls may be inbound or outbound. Inbound calls are made by consumers, for example to obtain information, report a malfunction, or ask for help. In contrast, outbound calls are made by agents to consumers, usually for sales purposes ( telemarketing ). One can combine inbound and outbound campaigns.

The first tier consists of operators, who initially answer calls and provide general information. If a caller requires more assistance, the call is forwarded to the second tier (in the appropriate department depending on the nature of the call). In some cases, there are three or more tiers of support staff. Typically the third tier of support is formed of product engineers/developers or highly skilled technical support staff for the product. Some critics of call centres argue that the work atmosphere in such an environment is dehumanising.

Inbound call centre - Exclusively or predominantly handles inbound calls (calls initiated by the customer). Outbound call centre - One in which call centre agents make outbound calls to customers or sales leads. Blended call centre - Combining automatic call distribution for incoming calls with predictive dialling for outbound calls, it makes more efficient use of agent time as each type of agent (inbound or outbound) can handle the overflow of the other. [ Criticism and performance ] [ November 2010 ] Criticisms of call centres generally follow a number of common themes, from both callers and call centre staff. From callers, common criticisms include: [ http://online.wsj.com/google_login.html?url%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB116171027921802238.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj If You Want to Scream, Press... - Preview Online.wsj.com 2012-01-28 ] [ http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/pubs/In_Queue/vol2no24.html nationalcallcenters 2012-02-09 ] Operators working from a script Non-expert operators (call screening) Incompetent or untrained operators incapable of processing customers&apos; requests effectively Obsequious behavior by operators (e.g., relentless use of &quot; sir, &quot; &quot; ma&apos;am &quot; and &quot; I&apos;d be happy to assist you &quot; ) Overseas location, with language and accent problems Touch tone menu systems and automated queuing systems Excessive waiting times to be connected to an operator Complaints that departments of companies do not engage in communication with one another Deceit over location of call centre (such as allocating overseas workers false English names) Requiring the caller to repeat the same information multiple times Common criticisms from staff include: [ January 2012 ] Close scrutiny by management (e.g. frequent random call monitoring) Low compensation (pay and bonuses) Restrictive working practices (some operators are required to follow a pre-written script) High stress: a common problem associated with front-end jobs where employees deal directly with customers Repetitive job task Poor working conditions (e.g. poor facilities, poor maintenance and cleaning, cramped working conditions, management interference, lack of privacy and noisy) Impaired vision and hearing problems Rude and abusive customers The net-net of these concerns is that call centres as a business process exhibit levels of variability. The experience a customer gets and the results a company achieves on a given call are almost totally dependent on the quality of the agent answering that call. { Fleming, J., Coffman, C., Harter, J. (2005) Manage Your Human Sigma, Harvard Business Review } Call centres are beginning to address this by using Agent-assisted Automation to standardise the process all agents use.
