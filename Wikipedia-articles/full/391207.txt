In total he made 18 successful ascents on peaks above 8000 m from 1989 through 1997. Boukreev was lost under an avalanche while climbing his eighth 8,000 metre peak, Annapurna. Boukreev was relatively unknown, though well accomplished, in the international climbing community until the 1996 spring climbing season on Mount Everest, when eight people died in one of the biggest tragedies in the climbing history of Mount Everest. The event was chronicled in a number of books, including the best-selling books Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer and The Climb by Boukreev. [ Biography ] Boukreev was born in Korkino, within the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union (in the present Chelyabinsk Oblast ). After completing high school in 1975, he attended Chelyabinsk University for Pedagogy, where he majored in physics and earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 1979. At the same time, he also completed a coaching program for cross-country skiing. After graduation, the 21-year-old dreamed of mountain climbing. Boukreev moved to Alma-Ata, the capital of the neighbouring Kazakh SSR (present day Kazakhstan ) located in the Tian Shan mountain range. From 1985 he was part of a Kazakhstani mountaineering team, and he became a citizen of the Kazakhstan Republic in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 1996 he was the recipient of the David A. Sowles Memorial Award, the American Alpine Club&apos;s highest award for valour for his role in rescuing climbers in the 1996 Everest disaster. [ David A. Sowles Memorial Award http://www.americanalpineclub.org/p/sowles-award The American Alpine Club 20 March 2012 ] [ Climbing accomplishments ] The major highlights of Boukreev&apos;s climbing career are as follows: Lenin Peak (7,137 m)- First solo ascent April 15 Kangchenjunga (8,556 m) - new route with Second Soviet Himalaya Expedition April 30 - May 2 Kangchenjunga - first traverse of the four 8,000 m summits of the massif April Mount McKinley - Cassin Ridge route May Mount McKinley - West Rib route May 10 Dhaulagiri - new route on the west wall with First Kazakhstan Himalaya Expedition October 7 Mount Everest - South Col route May 14 Mount McKinley (6,193 m) July 30 K2 (8,611 m) April 29 Makalu II (8,460 m) May 15 Makalu (8,476 m) May 17 Mount Everest - North Ridge route June 30 Peak Abai (4,010 m) - guide for President of Kazakhstan October 8 Dhaulagiri (8,176 m) - fastest ascent record (17h 15m) December 8 Manaslu (8,156 m) with Second Kazakhstan Himalaya Expedition May 10 Mount Everest - South Col route May 17 Lhotse - solo ascent, speed record September 25 Cho Oyu (8,201 m) with Third Kazakhstan Himalaya Expedition October 9 North summit of Shishapangma (8,008 m) April 24 Mount Everest (8,848 m) May 23 Lhotse (8,501 m) July 7 Broad Peak (8,047 m) - solo ascent July 14 Gasherbrum II (8,035 m) - solo ascent [ Everest 1996 ] Boukreev became widely known as the lead climbing guide for the Mountain Madness expedition headed by Scott Fischer in May 1996. The expedition was one of several attempting to summit Everest on the same day (May 10th). Soon after summitting on May 10 a disastrous blizzard struck, stranding many climbers near the peak overnight, and by May 11 eight climbers from three different expeditions perished. Boukreev rescued three climbers stranded in the disaster above 8000 m, and indeed all six of the climbing clients on the Mountain Madness expedition survived the ordeal. Some have described his rescue efforts as: { Galen Rowell, Wall Street Journal, May 29, 1997 } One of the most amazing rescues in mountaineering history performed single-handedly a few hours after climbing Everest without oxygen by a man some describe as the Leonidas of Himalayan climbing. Others were much more critical. Jon Krakauer described his behavior on the day of the disaster as &quot; extremely unorthodox &quot; and wrote that one of Boukreev&apos;s clients said that he &quot; cut and ran... when it mattered most &quot;. At the core of controversy was Boukreev&apos;s decision to attempt the summit without supplementary oxygen (which Krakauer saw as irresponsible for a guide) and to descend to the camp ahead of his clients in the face of approaching darkness and blizzard. He was one of the first to reach the summit on the day of the disaster and stayed at or near the summit for nearly 1.5 hours helping others with their summit efforts, before returning to his tent by 5 PM on May 10th, well ahead of the later summitters on his team. Boukreev&apos;s supporters point to the fact that his return to camp allowed him enough rest that, when the blizzard had subsided around midnight, he was able to mount a rescue attempt and to lead several climbers still stranded on the mountain back to the safety of the camp. Boukreev&apos;s detractors say that had he simply stayed with the clients, he would have been in better position to assist them down the mountain, though it should be noted that every one of Boukreev&apos;s clients survived, including the three (Pittman, Fox, Madsen) that he rescued on May 11 after he had rested and overcome hypoxia. The only client deaths that day were suffered by the Adventure Consultants expedition, led by guide Rob Hall, who lost his own life when he did choose to stay and help a client complete a late summit rather than helping the client descend and replenish.

They were accompanied by Dimitri Sobolev, a cinematographer from Kazakhstan, who was documenting the attempt. On December 25 around noon, Boukreev and Moro were fixing rope s in a couloir at around the [ 5700 m ft on ] level. Suddenly, a cornice broke loose from a ridge not visible from the climbing route. The resulting avalanche knocked Moro down the mountain where he landed just above their tent at Camp I [ 5200 m ft on ]. Fortuitously, Moro had somehow stayed near the top of the avalanche debris and managed to dig himself out after a few minutes. Unable to see or hear any signs of Boukreev or Sobolev, Moro descended to Annapurna base camp where he was flown by helicopter back to Kathmandu for surgery on his hands, which had been ripped down to the tendon s during the fall. News of the accident reached New Mexico on December 26. Linda Wylie, Boukreev&apos;s girlfriend, left for Nepal on December 28. Several attempts were made to reach the avalanche site by helicopter but inclement weather in late December prevented search teams from reaching Camp I. There was some hope that perhaps Boukreev and Sobolev had managed to reach Camp I. However, on January 3, 1998, searchers were finally able to reach Camp I and an empty tent. Linda Wylie subsequently issued a somber statement from Kathmandu: This is the end... there are no hopes of finding him alive. At the site of Annapurna base-camp there is a memorial chorten to Boukreev including a quotation of his: Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion...I go to them as humans go to worship. From their lofty summits I view my past, dream of the future and, with an unusual acuity, am allowed to experience the present moment...my vision cleared, my strength renewed. In the mountains I celebrate creation. On each journey I am reborn.
