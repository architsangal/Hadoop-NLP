[ http://www.apalaweb.org/awards/awards0203.htm Asian Pacific American Award for Literature (APAAL) 2001–2003 APAAL 19 October 2010 ] [ Plot ] Life of Pi is divided into three sections. In the first, the main character, Pi, an adult, reminisces about his childhood. He was named Piscine Molitor Patel after a swimming pool in France. He changes his name to &quot; Pi &quot; when he begins secondary school, because he is tired of being taunted with the nickname &quot; Pissing Patel. &quot; His father owns a zoo in Pondicherry, providing Pi with a relatively affluent lifestyle and some understanding of animal psychology. { Martel, p. 14 } Pi was born a Hindu, but as a fourteen-year-old he is introduced to Christianity and Islam, and starts to follow all three religions as he &quot; just wants to love god. &quot; { Martel, p. 69 } [ http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2077 Life of Pi(review) 2011-10-10 ] He tries to understand God through the lens of each religion and comes to recognize benefits in each one. Eventually, his family decides to sell their animals and move to Canada due to political concerns in India. In the second part of the novel, Pi&apos;s family embark on a small Japanese freighter to Canada carrying some of the animals from their zoo, but a few days out of port the boat suddenly sinks. Pi ends up in a small lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, a spotted hyena, an injured zebra, and an orangutan. The other humans and animals on the boat all drown. The hungry hyena tears off the zebra&apos;s leg, and spends the next several days eating the zebra bit by bit. The hyena also kills the orangutan. Richard Parker then kills and eats the hyena. Pi is left as the only other survivor. Pi finds food and water supplies on the boat, but as they grow scarce, Pi begins fishing. Pi feeds Richard Parker so that the tiger will not eat him; he also wants to keep the tiger alive to avoid total solitude on the ocean. Pi ensures that the tiger considers Pi the alpha animal and will therefore refrain from attacking him. Pi recounts that after an indeterminate time at sea, the pair encountered a mysterious island, seemingly constructed of edible algae supporting a forest and a large population of meerkat s. Following a period of recuperation, Pi becomes afraid of the island after discovering that the algae is carnivorous, and leaves with the tiger. In all, Pi survives 227 days in the lifeboat, often half delusional with thirst and hunger. The lifeboat reaches the coast of Mexico and Richard Parker escapes into the nearby jungle, so that rescuers find only Pi. The third part of the novel is a conversation between two officials from the Japanese maritime department. They seek to ascertain why the ship sank, so they interview Pi, but they do not believe his story. Pi then tells a similar story, but this time without animals. Instead, he recounts a story of human brutality, being adrift on a lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg, and the ship&apos;s cook, who killed the sailor and Pi&apos;s mother and cut them up to use as bait and food. Parallels to Pi&apos;s first story lead the Japanese officials to believe that the orangutan represents his mother, the zebra represents the sailor, the hyena represents the cook, and Richard Parker is Pi himself. Pi asks if this new story is acceptable, or if he should change any parts that are still too unbelievable; the officials change the subject back to the sinking of the ship. After giving all the relevant information, Pi asks which of the two stories they prefer. Since the officials cannot prove which story is true and neither is relevant to the reasons behind the shipwreck, they choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says, &quot; and so it goes with God &quot;. [ Inspiration ] In a 2002 interview with PBS, Martel revealed his inspiration for his novel, &quot; I was sort of looking for a story, not only with a small &apos;s&apos; but sort of with a capital &apos;S&apos;  – something that would direct my life. &quot; [ Martel Yann Yann Martel http://www.pbs.org/newshour/conversation/july-dec02/martel_11-11.html Ray Suarez PBS NewsHour PBS 11 November 2002 31 August 2010 ] He spoke of being lonely and needing direction in his life. The novel became that direction and purpose for his life.

His youthful exploration into comparative religion culminates in a magnificent epiphany of sorts. right ] Piscine Molitor &quot; Pi &quot; Patel is the narrator and protagonist of the novel. He was named after a swimming pool in Paris, despite the fact that neither his father nor his mother particularly liked swimming. The story is told as a narrative from the perspective of a middle-aged Pi, now married and with his own family, and living in Canada. At the time of main events of the story, he is sixteen years old. He recounts the story of his life and his 227-day journey on a lifeboat when his boat sinks in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during a voyage to Winnipeg. [ Richard Parker ] { Bengal tiger much like the one that spent 227 days with Pi } Richard Parker is a 450 pound Bengal tiger that is stranded on the lifeboat with Pi when the ship sinks. The tiger lives on the lifeboat with Pi and is kept alive with the food and water Pi delivers. Richard Parker develops a relationship with Pi that allows them to coexist in their struggle. [ Richard Parker (shipwrecked) ] Martel named the tiger after a character from Edgar Allan Poe &apos;s nautical adventure novel, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838). However, there were a number of other men named Richard Parker who are relevant to Martel&apos;s choice, and that are tied to tales of cannibalism by shipwrecked sailors. Such tales abounded in the 18th and 19th centuries. For instance, in December 1835, the ship Francis Spaight was wrecked in the north Atlantic. Survivors of the wreck were known to have practiced cannibalism in order to survive. In January 1846, a second ship named &quot; Francis Spaight &quot; sank, and took a man named Richard Parker down with it. Another man named Richard Parker was found to be the victim of cannibalism after being set adrift with two other men on a raft in 1884, after a yacht called The Mignonette sank, leaving the crew stranded and starving. { Hutchison, Allan C. &quot; Is Eating People Wrong?: Great Legal Cases and How They Shaped the World. &quot; Toronto: Cambridge University Press, 2011. } In 1884, 46 years after Poe&apos;s novel was published, a new shipwreck shared many similarities with that story: after the sinking of their yacht Mignonette on the way to Australia, Captain Tom Dudley and three sailors were stranded in a dinghy in the Pacific Ocean. They believed they had no choice but to eat one of the party to survive. The victim was a 17-year-old cabin boy named Richard Parker. { The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens; L.R. 14 Q.B.D. 273 } A.W. Brian Simpson&apos;s book on the subject mentions the Francis Spaight and also refers to a boat called Tiger on which a youth was cannibalized in 1766. Having read about these events, Yann Martel thought, &quot; So many victimized Richard Parkers had to mean something. &quot; [ http://www.canongate.net/News/BehindLifeOfPi Yann Martel on tigers, cannibals and Edgar Allan Poe 14 May 2002 Canongate Books 1 September 2010 http://web.archive.org/web/20080318173941/http%3A//www.canongate.net/News/BehindLifeOfPi 18 March 2008 ] [ http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie%3DUTF8%26amp%3BdocId%3D309590 How Richard Parker Came to Get His Name Martel, Yann Yann Martel Amazon.com 1 September 2010 ] [ Setting ] The novel is a work of fiction set in the summer of 1977 that draws real places and events in India. The Patel household&apos;s discussions of the political situation refer to historical events. Pondicherry is a former French colony in India. It does have an Indian Coffee House and Botanical Gardens. The Botanical Garden has a toy train track. It does not have a working train, nor does the garden have a zoo, although it does have a small aquarium. Munnar, the destination for the Patel family&apos;s vacation, is a small but popular hill station in Kerala. The town has a church. Madurai, also referenced in the novel, is a popular tourist and pilgrimage site in Tamil Nadu.
