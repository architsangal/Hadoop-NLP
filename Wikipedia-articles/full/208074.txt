[ yes 2001 10 05 ] { 1.4.1 } [ 2012 01 27 ] { C++ and } { SDL } { Cross-platform } { Interpreter } { GNU General Public License } ScummVM is a collection of game engine recreation s. Originally designed to play LucasArts adventure games that use the SCUMM system (the VM in the name stands for virtual machine ), it now also supports a variety of non-SCUMM games by companies like Revolution Software and Adventure Soft. It was originally written by Ludvig Strigeus. { history of ScummVM on ScummVM Wiki } Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, ScummVM is free software. ScummVM is a reimplementation of the part of the software used to interpret the scripting language s such games used to describe the game world rather than emulating the hardware the games ran on; as such, ScummVM allows the games it supports to be played on platforms other than those for which they were originally released. [ Ports ] Portability is a design goal of the project. { ScummVM Portability guidelines } Ports of ScummVM are available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and a variety of Unix-like systems including Linux (RPM Based, Debian based, source based), members of the BSD family ( FreeBSD / NetBSD / OpenBSD / DragonFly BSD ) and Solaris. It has also been ported to console systems. Less mainstream personal computer ports include those to AmigaOS / MorphOS, Atari/FreeMiNT, Haiku / BeOS / ZETA and OS/2. A variety of game console s have official ports; ScummVM has been ported to gaming machines such as the PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, Nintendo GameCube and Wii, { News on Gamecube/Wii ports } and to handheld console s including the GP2X, Nintendo DS and the PlayStation Portable. Handheld computer platforms supported include Palm OS / Tapwave Zodiac, Symbian OS ( UIQ platform, Nokia 60, 80 and Nokia 7710 / 90 phone series), Nokia&apos;s Internet Tablet OS (used by the Nokia 770, N800 and N810 ), Apple&apos;s iPhone, { Gizmodo news on iPhone port } MotoMAGX, MotoEZX phones and Windows Mobile. Platforms supported by unofficial ScummVM ports include the Microsoft&apos;s Xbox gaming console, BlackBerry PlayBook, { ScummVM for PlayBook } Zaurus, Gizmondo and GP32 portable device platforms. Mobile phone s running Android, { scummvm-android } webOS { Webos Internals Team Ports ScummVM on WebOS } or unofficial Samsung&apos;s bada OS are also supported. [ Games supported by ScummVM ] { GUI of ScummVM 0.8.0 with the &quot; Classic (builtin) &quot; skin } The following games have support built into the current release of ScummVM. { Not all games are completable or even playable.

Elvira 3) Ween: The Prophecy [ Mistic&apos;s GPL violations ] [ 40% 1px In December 2008, members of the ScummVM team discovered that three games for the Nintendo Wii console ( &quot; Freddi Fish: The Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds &quot;,... &quot; Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It&apos;s Dark Outside &quot;,... and &quot; Spy Fox: Dry Cereal &quot;,...) made use of ScummVM, without complying with the terms of the GPL license. They sent a warning letter to the German distributor of these games, Atari Deutschland GmbH, who was not aware that ScummVM was used in the creation of the games. Atari Deutschland GmbH established contact with Mistic Software Inc., the developers of the games. Mistic Software Inc. responded by denying that members of the ScummVM team hold any rights to the particular code they used. The dispute was ultimately settled in May 2009 by Mistic Software Inc. paying all legal fees and making a donation to the Free Software Foundation as a sign of good will, without acknowledging copyright infringement. ] In December 2008, the ScummVM team was informed that three games for the Wii console were using ScummVM illegally. Atari had contracted Majesco Entertainment to port these titles to the Wii, who in turn contracted Mistic Software to port the games. Mistic used the ScummVM binary (version 0.9.0), in addition to the games&apos; assets and source code, to port the games, but did not credit the ScummVM team or distribute ScummVM source code as required by ScummVM&apos;s license, the GNU GPL. Examination of the binary showed a clear violation; the ScummVM team credits were still in the code, as well as known bugs from that release. The team contacted gpl-violations.org for legal representation. At first denying the charges, Atari later started negotiating when they learned the ScummVM team only desired adherence to the GPL, and not monetary compensation. However, upon learning that using open-source software is forbidden by Nintendo for use with the Wii software development kit, the developers challenged the legality of the reverse engineering methods used by the ScummVM team, claiming that they therefore had no rights over the resulting code. The ScummVM team denied these charges. Faced with a long court battle, the matter was settled by ScummVM team members fingolfin and cyx, who agreed to post a press release and no longer speak of the case. The remaining copies of the games violating the GPL were ordered to be sold within a set period, after which time all remaining stock copies must be destroyed or high fines will be levied. As a result, Mistic must make a donation to the Free Software Foundation in addition to paying all expenses incurred by the lawyers working for gpl-violations.org. { GPL, ScummVM and violations } [ Development ] ScummVM was a participant in the Google Summer of Code 2007, 2008, { Summer of Code project ideas page } 2009, 2010 { http://www.scummvm.org/news/20100428/ } { http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2010/scummvm } and 2011. { http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc } { http://google-melange.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2011/scummvm } The following games have been added to ScummVM&apos;s Subversion tree. The engines may be in various states of operation. [ 2 * Inca II: Wiracocha * Myst * Operation Stealth * Orion Burger * Personal Nightmare * Riven: The Sequel to Myst * The 11th Hour * The Big Red Adventure * The Last Dynasty ] Another World was integrated for a short period of time causing a brief but heated discussion, ranging from emotional to purely technical aspects. Some felt it was more of an action game than an adventure game, others worried that ScummVM, being geared towards bitmapped graphics, really was not the ideal platform for a polygon-based game. The discussion was rendered moot when the raw project was officially closed by its author, at the request of Eric Chahi, the original developer of Another World, who was developing his own Windows-based update. [ July 2008 ] Operation Stealth and Future Wars support was added by integrating another stand-alone recreation of their engine: cinE. { SourceForge.net: cinE - the cinematic Engine } In 2006, the Adventure Game Interpreter engine was added. It is based on Sarien code, an AGI interpreter that was outdated and buggy in some ways, which has been solved in the new ScummVM engine. The Sarien project stopped its development, continuing the development into ScummVM&apos;s AGI engine. { Old Sarien Site } TrollVM has also been integrated into ScummVM adding support for three pre-AGI games: Mickey&apos;s Space Adventure, Troll&apos;s Tale, and Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood. { Old TrollVM Site } { http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/ticket/9661 } In 2009, there was a merge with FreeSCI project. The first official merged version appeared in October 2010, introducing support for Sierra&apos;s Creative Interpreter games. During the development cycle leading up to the 0.5.0 release on August 2, 2003, game manufacturer Revolution Software not only helped ScummVM developers add support for their adventure Beneath a Steel Sky by supplying them with the original source code, but also decided to release both the CD and the floppy version of the game as freeware, { Revolution Software Website } available for download on the ScummVM website. { ScummVM 0.5.0 Out, With Some Official Game Support at } { Slashdot } A few months later, the developers of Flight of the Amazon Queen made it freely available in much the same way.
