Elliott co-wrote the film with Adam Resnick. Both men worked for Late Night with David Letterman in the 1980s, as well as the short-lived FOX sitcom Get a Life in the early 1990s. The project was originally to be directed by Tim Burton, who had contacted Chris Elliott after seeing Get a Life episode &quot; Neptune 2000 &quot;. Writer Adam Resnick took over the direction after Burton was offered the film Ed Wood. [ Plot ] Nathaniel Mayweather ( Chris Elliott ) is a snobbish, self-centered virginal man. He is invited by his father to sail to Hawaii aboard the Queen Catherine. After annoying the driver he is forced to walk the rest of the way. Nathaniel makes a wrong turn into a small fishing village where he meets the imbecilic cabin boy/first mate Kenny ( Andy Richter ), and thinks the ship, The Filthy Whore, is a theme ship. It is not until the next morning that Captain Greybar ( Ritch Brinkley ) finds Nathaniel in his room. Nathaniel also realizes that he is on the wrong boat that will not return to dry land for three months. Nathaniel tries to unsuccessfully convince each fisherman to set sail to Hawaii. Later Nathaniel convinces Kenny to set sail for Hawaii. On the way to Hawaii the ship is caught in a fierce storm and Kenny is knocked over board and drowns. Without a cabin boy Greybar forces Nathaniel do the chores. Eventually the crew reaches Hell&apos;s Bucket, a Bermuda Triangle -like area where weird events occur. The four fishermen decide to give Nathaniel another chore that involves dragging him on a floating raft two miles behind for a week to spot any sign of life. Nathaniel has little food and water, begins consuming salt water, and suffers extreme sunburn after confusing cooking oil as lotion. He also realizes he might be going insane after sighting Kenny&apos;s ghost and seeing a floating cupcake that spits tobacco. After falling into the water he is saved by a &quot; shark-man. &quot; Nine days later Nathaniel is pulled back in and tells what happened. It is reveal by Skunk ( Brian-Doyle Murray ) and Big Teddy ( Brion James ) that the shark-man is known as Chocki ( Russ Tamblyn ). Later Nathaniel spots a beautiful young woman name Trina ( Melora Walters ) swimming in the ocean. After she is pulled up in a net Nathaniel becomes smitten with her. With the four fishermen displeased by another passenger they decide to strand both Trina and Nathaniel on the island they&apos;re sailing to. After reaching the island the crew searches for components to fix their boat. Meanwhile Nathaniel tries to get closer to Trina who constantly rejects him. Greybar and Skunk both suggest to Nathaniel that a beautiful woman named Calli ( Ann Magnuson ) can help him build his confidence. After an encounter with Calli, Nathaniel again meets Trini who becomes attracted to him immediately. Later Calli&apos;s husband Mulligan ( Mike Starr ), a giant, comes home to find Nathaniel&apos;s bag. Realizing what Calli has done, Mulligan decides to go and kill him. Nathaniel tries to save everyone by confessing to the giant he&apos;s the one who slept with Calli. When Mulligan is about to kill Nathaniel with a giant nail clipper Chocki saves him. While Mulligan grapples with Chocki, Nathaniel kills Mulligan by choking him with his own belt. After everyone arrives in Hawaii Nathaniel offers his new found companions a job at the hotel where his father is the owner. However they refuse the offer because all they know how to do is fish and stink. They also tell him that Nathaniel is a fancy lad and should stay in Hawaii where he belongs. Nathaniel and Trina depart ways. His father, William Mayweather ( Bob Elliott, Chris Elliott&apos;s real-life father), expresses his disappointment towards his actions. Not wanting to live the fancy life Nathaniel leaves the office, finds Trina and both join the crew on the The Filthy Whore.
