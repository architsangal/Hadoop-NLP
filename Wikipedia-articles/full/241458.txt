[ May 2012 ] [ yes 1948 1 28 ] { Arthington, Liberia } { National Patriotic Party } { Jewel Howard (1997–2006) } { Charles Phillip } { Bentley University } Charles McArthur Ghankay Taylor (born 28 January 1948) is a Liberian politician who was the 22nd President of Liberia, serving from 2 August 1997 until his resignation on 11 August 2003.

After being removed for embezzlement, he eventually arrived in Libya, where he was trained as a guerilla fighter. He returned to Liberia in 1989 as the head of a Libyan-backed resistance group, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, to overthrow the Doe regime, initiating the First Liberian Civil War. Following Doe&apos;s execution, he gained control of a large portion of the country and became one of the most prominent warlord s in Africa.

Domestically, opposition to his regime grew, culminating in the outbreak of the Second Liberian Civil War in 1999. By 2003, he had lost control of much of the countryside and was formally indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. That year, he resigned as a result of growing international pressure and went into exile in Nigeria. In 2006, the newly elected President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf formally requested his extradition, after which he was detained by UN authorities in Sierra Leone and then at the Penitentiary Institution Haaglanden in The Hague, awaiting trial.

He took the name &apos;Ghankay&apos; later on, possibly to please and gain favor with the indigenous people.

[ Government, imprisonment and escape ] Taylor supported the 12 April 1980 coup led by Samuel Doe, which saw the murder of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. and seizure of power by Doe. Taylor was appointed to a high position in Doe’s government in the General Services Agency of Liberia, a position that left him in charge of purchasing for the Liberian government. However, he was sacked in May 1983 for embezzling almost $1,000,000 and sending the funds to an American bank account. Taylor fled to the United States but was arrested on 24 May 1984 by two US Deputy Marshals in Somerville, Massachusetts, on a warrant for extradition to face charges of embezzling $922,000 of government funds intended for machinery parts. Citing a fear of assassination by Liberian agents, Taylor sought to fight extradition from the safety of jail with the help of his attorney, former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark. He was detained in a House of Corrections in Plymouth, Massachusetts. On 15 September 1985, Taylor and four other inmates allegedly escaped from the Plymouth facility, a minimum security prison, by sawing through a bar covering a window in an unused laundry room. After dropping 12 feet to the ground by means of a knotted sheet, the five inmates climbed a fence. Shortly thereafter, Taylor and two other escapees were met at nearby Jordan Hospital by Taylor&apos;s wife, Enid, and Taylor&apos;s sister-in-law, Lucia Holmes Toweh. A getaway car was driven to Staten Island, where Taylor then disappeared. All four of Taylor&apos;s fellow escapees, as well as Enid and Toweh, were later apprehended. [ May 2012 ] In July 2009, Mr Taylor himself told at his trial, at the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone in the Hague, that US CIA agents had helped him escape from the maximum[minimum?] security prison in Boston in 1985. The US Defence Intelligence Agency did confirm that Mr Taylor first started working with US intelligence in the 1980s but refused to give details on exactly what role Mr Taylor played, citing national security. { http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16627628 } [ Civil war ] Taylor managed to flee the United States and shortly thereafter it is assumed that he went to Libya, where he underwent guerrilla training under Muammar Gaddafi, becoming Gaddafi&apos;s protégé. [ http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id%3D9441341 How the mighty are falling 17 July 2007 5 July 2007 The Economist ] Eventually, he left Libya and traveled to Côte d&apos;Ivoire, where he founded the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). In December 1989, Taylor launched a Libyan-funded armed uprising from Côte d&apos;Ivoire into Liberia to overthrow the Doe regime, leading to the First Liberian Civil War. { Grim legacy of Liberia&apos;s most isolated town BBC } By 1990, his forces soon controlled most of the country. That same year, Prince Johnson, a senior commander of Taylor&apos;s NPFL, broke away and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL). In September 1990, Johnson captured Monrovia, depriving Taylor of outright victory. Doe was captured and torture d to death by Johnson and his forces, resulting in a violent political fragmentation of the country. The civil war turned into an ethnic conflict, with seven factions fighting for control of Liberia&apos;s resources (especially iron ore, diamonds, timber, and rubber). According to a 2 June 1999, article in The Virginian-Pilot, { Sizemore, Bill. &quot; Robertson, Liberian Leader Hope to Strike Gold in Coastal Africa. &quot; The Virginian-Pilot. 2 June 1999. (Copy found at.) Charles Taylor... } Taylor had extensive business dealings with American televangelist Pat Robertson during the civil war. According to the article, Taylor gave Robertson the rights to mine for diamonds in Liberia&apos;s mineral-rich countryside. According to two Operation Blessing pilots who reported this incident to the Commonwealth of Virginia for investigation in 1994, Robertson used his Operation Blessing planes to haul diamond-mining equipment to his new mines in Liberia, despite the fact that Robertson was telling his 700 Club viewers that the planes were sending relief supplies to the victims of the genocide in Rwanda. The subsequent investigation by the Commonwealth of Virginia concluded that Robertson diverted his ministry&apos;s donations to the Liberian diamond-mining operation, but Attorney General of Virginia Mark Earley blocked any potential prosecution against Robertson, as the relief supplies were also sent.

He famously campaigned on the slogan &quot; He killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will vote for him. &quot; [ Sarah Left War in Liberia 4 August 2003 http://www.guardian.co.uk/westafrica/story/0%2C%2C1008084%2C00.html The Guardian 18 January 2008 London ] The elections were overseen by the United Nations&apos; peacekeeping mission, United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, along with a contingent from the Economic Community of West African States. [ http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/co_mission/unomil.htm UNOMIL 18 January 2008 2001 Information Technology Section/Department of Public Information ] Taylor won the election in a landslide, garnering 75 percent of the vote. Taylor&apos;s toughest competitor, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, collected only 10 percent of the vote. Taylor&apos;s victory has been widely attributed to the belief that he would resume the war if he lost. [ March 2012 ] During his time in office, Taylor ran down the Armed Forces of Liberia, dismissing 2,400–2,600 former personnel, many of whom were ethnic Krahn brought in by former President Doe. { Adebayo, Liberia&apos;s Civil War, International Peace Academy, 2002, p.235 } In its place, he installed the Anti-Terrorist Unit, the Special Operations Division of the Liberian National Police (LNP), which he used as his own private army. Numerous allegations were leveled at Taylor during his presidency, particularly regarding his involvement in the Sierra Leone Civil War. He was accused of aiding the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) through weapon sales in exchange for blood diamonds. Due to a UN embargo against arms sales to Liberia at the time, these weapons were largely purchased on the black market through arms smugglers such as Viktor Bout.

Moreover, he was accused of assisting the RUF in the recruitment of child soldiers. In addition to aiding the RUF in these acts, Taylor reportedly personally directed RUF operations in Sierra Leone. { Merchant of Death: Money, guns, planes, and the man who makes war possible.

Upon being charged by the UN of being a gunrunner and diamond smuggler during his presidency, he publicly appeared in all white robes and begged God for forgiveness, while at the same time denying the charges.

This group was frequently accused of atrocities, and is thought to have been backed by the government of neighboring Guinea. [ Back to the Brink Human Rights Watch Report 1 May 2002 14 4(A) http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/liberia/ 18 January 2008 ] This uprising signaled the beginning of the Second Liberian Civil War. By early 2003, LURD had gained control of northern Liberia. That year, a second Ivorian -backed rebel group, Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), emerged in southern Liberia and achieved rapid successes.

On 7 March 2003, the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) issued a sealed indictment for Taylor. { &quot; The Prosecutor vs. Charles Ghankay Taylor &quot; The Special Court for Sierra Leone. Retrieved 26 March 2010 } Earlier that year, Liberian forces had killed Sam Bockarie, a leading member of the RUF in Sierra Leone, in a shootout under Taylor&apos;s orders. Some have claimed that Taylor ordered Bockarie killed in order to prevent Bockarie from testifying against him at the SCSL. [ The Mysterious Death of a Fugitive 7 May 2003 The Perspective (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) http://www.theperspective.org/fugitivebockarie.html The Perspective 18 January 2008 ] In June 2003, the Prosecutor to the Special Court unsealed the indictment and announced publicly that Taylor was charged with war crimes. The indictment asserted that Taylor created and backed the RUF rebels in Sierra Leone, who were accused of a range of atrocities, including the use of child soldier s. [ David M. Crane CASE NO.

[ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4577547.stm BBC 24 May 2005 UN pressed over Liberia&apos;s Taylor Susannah Price 2 January 2010 ] The indictment was unsealed during Taylor&apos;s official visit to Ghana, where he was participating in peace talks with MODEL and LURD officials. With the backing of the then-South African president Thabo Mbeki and against the urging of Sierra Leone president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, Ghana declined to detain Taylor, who returned to Monrovia. [ Resignation ] During his absence for the peace talks in Ghana, it was alleged that the U.S. government urged Vice President Moses Blah to seize power. [ Jonathan Paye-Layleh Profile: Moses Blah 10 August 2003 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3140063.stm BBC News 18 January 2008 ] Upon his return, Taylor briefly dismissed Blah from his post, only to reinstate him a few days later. In July 2003, LURD initiated a siege of Monrovia, and several bloody battles were fought as Taylor&apos;s forces halted rebel attempts to capture the city. The pressure on Taylor increased further as U.S. President George W. Bush stated that Taylor &quot; must leave Liberia &quot; twice that month. On 9 July, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo offered Taylor exile in his country on the condition that Taylor stay out of Liberian politics. [ http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/09/liberia/ Nigeria would shield Taylor from trial CNN 10 July 2003 28 April 2010 ] Taylor insisted that he would resign only if U.S. peacekeeping troops were deployed to Liberia. Bush publicly called upon Taylor to resign and leave the country in order for any American involvement to be considered. Meanwhile, several African states, in particular the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) under the leadership of Nigeria, sent troops under the banner of ECOMIL to Liberia.

On 6 August, a 32-member U.S. military assessment team were deployed as a liaison with the ECOWAS troops. [ http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/07/liberia/ Liberia&apos;s Taylor not ready to leave 7 July 2003 CNN 28 April 2010 ] On 10 August, Taylor appeared on national television to announce that he would resign the following day and hand power to Vice President Blah. He harshly criticized the United States in his farewell address, saying that the Bush administration &apos;s insistence that he leave the country would hurt Liberia. On 11 August, Taylor resigned, with Blah serving as president until a transitional government was established on 14 October. At the handover were Ghana ian President John Kufuor, South African President Thabo Mbeki, and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, all representing African regional councils. The U.S. brought Joint Task Force Liberia &apos;s Amphibious Ready Group of three warships with 2,300 Marines into view of the coast. Taylor then flew to Nigeria, where the Nigerian government provided houses for him and his entourage in Calabar. [ Exile ] In November 2003, the United States Congress passed a bill that included a reward offer of two million dollars for Taylor&apos;s capture. While the peace agreement had guaranteed Taylor safe exile in Nigeria, it also required that he not attempt to influence Liberian politics, a requirement that his critics claimed he disregarded. On 4 December, Interpol issued a red notice regarding Taylor, suggesting that countries had a duty to arrest him. Taylor was placed on Interpol&apos;s Most Wanted list, declaring him wanted for crimes against humanity and breaches of the 1949 Geneva Convention, and noting that he should be considered dangerous. Nigeria stated it would not submit to Interpol&apos;s demands, agreeing only to deliver Taylor to Liberia in the event that the President of Liberia requested his return. On 17 March 2006, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the newly elected President of Liberia, submitted an official request to Nigeria for Taylor&apos;s extradition. This request was granted on 25 March, whereby Nigeria agreed to release Taylor to stand trial in the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). Nigeria agreed only to release Taylor and not to extradite him, as no extradition treaty existed between the two countries. [ Disappearance and arrest ] Three days after Nigeria announced its intent to hand him over to Liberia, Taylor disappeared from the seaside villa where he had been living in exile. [ Polgreen, Lydia Nigeria Says Ex-President of Liberia Has Disappeared The New York Times 29 March 2006 http://nytimes.com/2006/03/29/international/africa/29liberia.html ] One week prior to his disappearance, Nigerian authorities had taken the unusual step of allowing local press to accompany census takers into Taylor’s seaside Calabar compound. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo was scheduled to meet with President Bush less than 48 hours after Taylor was reported missing. Speculation ensued that Bush would refuse to meet with Obasanjo if Taylor were not apprehended. Less than 12 hours prior to the scheduled meeting between the two heads of state, Taylor was reported apprehended and en route to Liberia. On 29 March, Taylor tried to cross the border into Cameroon through the border town of Gamboru in northeastern Nigeria. His Range Rover with Nigerian diplomatic plates was stopped by border guards, and Taylor&apos;s identity was eventually established. State Department staff later reported that significant amounts of cash and heroin were found in the vehicle. Upon his arrival at Roberts International Airport in Harbel, Liberia, Taylor was arrested and handcuffed by LNP officers, who then immediately transferred responsibility for the custody of Taylor to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). Irish UNMIL soldiers then escorted Taylor aboard a UN helicopter to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where he was delivered to the SCSL. [ Trial ] Newsboard documenting the Charles Taylor case. The SCSL prosecutor originally indicted Taylor on 3 March 2003 on a 17 count indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict in Sierra Leone. On 16 March 2006, a SCSL judge gave leave to amend the indictment against Taylor. Under the amended indictment, Taylor was charged with 11 counts. At Taylor&apos;s initial appearance before the court on 3 April 2006, he entered a plea of not guilty.

King&apos;s predecessor had pushed for the trial to be held abroad because of fear that a local trial would be politically destabilizing in an area where Taylor still had influence. The Appeals Chamber of the Special Court dismissed a motion by Taylor&apos;s defense team, who argued that their client could not get a fair trial there and also wanted the Special Court to withdraw the request to move the trial to The Hague.

This fulfilled a condition laid down by the Dutch government, who had stated they were willing to host the trial but would not jail him if convicted.
