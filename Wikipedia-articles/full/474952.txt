[ 2010Census_prelim ] { 5873 } [ 2002Census ] { 1933 } { 41167 } { May 2010 } Tiksi ( [ Тикси ] ) is an urban locality (a settlement ) and the administrative center of Bulunsky District of the Sakha Republic, Russia, situated on the Arctic Ocean coast. Population: [ 5,055 5,873 11,649 ]. Despite its rapid population decline it remains the most northerly settlement with a population of more than 5,000. It is one of the principal ports for accessing the Laptev Sea. It is served by the Tiksi Airport and saw other military construction projects during the Cold War at Tiksi North and Tiksi West airfields. [ History ] Tiksi, on the Laptev Sea, Arctic Ocean In August 1901, Russian Arctic ship &apos;&apos;Zarya&apos;&apos; headed across the Laptev Sea, searching for the legendary Sannikov Land (Zemlya Sannikova) but was soon blocked by floating pack ice in the New Siberian Islands. During 1902 the attempts to reach Sannikov Land continued while Zarya was trapped in fast ice. Leaving the ship, Russian Arctic explorer Baron Eduard Toll and three companions vanished forever in November 1902 while travelling away from Bennett Island towards the south on loose ice floes. Zarya was finally moored close to Brusneva Island in the Bay of Tiksi (Bukhta Tiksi), never to leave the place again. The remaining members of the expedition returned to Saint Petersburg, while Captain Matisen went to Yakutsk. The name Tiksi means &quot; a moorage place &quot; in Sakha language. Tiksi [ Climate ] Tiksi, as would be expected from its location, has a polar climate ( Köppen ET). Winters are brutally cold, though no colder than the inland subarctic regions, and have frequent and occasionally heavy snowfalls. The very short summers are generally mild, though in 1991 a freakish temperature as high as [ 34 C F 0 ] was reported, and quite damp with rainfall on most days.
