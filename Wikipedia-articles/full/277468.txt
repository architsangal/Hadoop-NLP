[ the two-body problem in classical mechanics the career management problem of working couples two-body problem (career) ] { barycenter with elliptic orbits. } In classical mechanics, the two-body problem is to determine the motion of two point particles that interact only with each other. Common examples include a satellite orbiting a planet, a planet orbiting a star, two star s orbiting each other (a binary star ), and a classical electron orbiting an atomic nucleus (although to solve this system correctly a quantum mechanical approach must be used). The two-body problem can be re-formulated as two independent one-body problems, a trivial one and one that involves solving for the motion of one particle in an external potential. Since many one-body problems can be solved exactly, the corresponding two-body problem can also be solved. By contrast, the three-body problem (and, more generally, the &apos;&apos;n&apos;&apos;-body problem for n  ≥  3) cannot be solved, [ April 2012 ] except in special cases. { mass orbiting around a common } { barycenter.

The goal is to determine the trajectories x 1 (t) and x 2 (t) for all times t, given the initial positions x 1 (t  =  0) and x 2 (t  =  0) and the initial velocities v 1 (t  =  0) and v 2 (t  =  0). When applied to the two masses, Newton&apos;s second law states that \mathbf{F}_{12}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2}) = m_{1} \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{1} \quad \quad \quad (\mathrm{Equation} \ 1) \mathbf{F}_{21}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2}) = m_{2} \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{2} \quad \quad \quad (\mathrm{Equation} \ 2) where F 12 is the force on mass 1 due to its interactions with mass 2, and F 21 is the force on mass 2 due to its interactions with mass 1. Adding and subtracting these two equations decouples them into two one-body problems, which can be solved independently. Adding equations (1) and (2) results in an equation describing the center of mass ( barycenter ) motion. By contrast, subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) results in an equation that describes how the vector r  =  x 1   &amp; minus;  x 2 between the masses changes with time. The solutions of these independent one-body problems can be combined to obtain the solutions for the trajectories x 1 (t) and x 2 (t). [ Center of mass motion (1st one-body problem) ] Addition of the force equations (1) and (2) yields m_{1}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_1 + m_2 \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_2 = (m_1 + m_2)\ddot{\mathbf{R}} = \mathbf{F}_{12} + \mathbf{F}_{21} = 0 where we have used Newton&apos;s third law F 12  =   &amp; minus;F 21 and where \ddot{\mathbf{R}} \equiv \frac{m_{1}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{1} + m_{2}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}} \mathbf{R} is the position of the center of mass ( barycenter ) of the system. The resulting equation: \ddot{\mathbf{R}} = 0 shows that the velocity V  =  d&apos;&apos;R/dt of the center of mass is constant, from which follows that the total momentum m 1 v 1  +  m 2 v 2 is also constant ( conservation of momentum ). Hence, the position R (t&apos;&apos;) of the center of mass can be determined at all times from the initial positions and velocities. [ Displacement vector motion (2nd one-body problem) ] Dividing both force equations by the respective masses, subtracting the second equation from the first and rearranging gives the equation \ddot {\mathbf{r}} = \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{1} - \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{2} = \left( \frac{\mathbf{F}_{12}}{m_{1}} - \frac{\mathbf{F}_{21}}{m_{2}} \right) = \left(\frac{1}{m_{1}} + \frac{1}{m_{2}} \right)\mathbf{F}_{12} where we have again used Newton&apos;s third law F 12  =   &amp; minus;F 21 and where r is the displacement vector from mass 2 to mass 1, as defined above. The force between the two objects, which originates in the two objects, should only be a function of their separation r and not of their absolute positions x 1 and x 2; otherwise, there would not be translational symmetry, and the laws of physics would have to change from place to place. The subtracted equation can therefore be written: \mu \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{F}_{12}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2}) = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) where \mu is the reduced mass \mu = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{m_1} + \frac{1}{m_{2}}} = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} Solving the equation for r(t) is the key to the two-body problem; general solution methods are described below. Once R (t) and r(t) have been determined, the original trajectories may be obtained \mathbf{x}_1(t) = \mathbf{R} (t) + \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \mathbf{r}(t) \mathbf{x}_2(t) = \mathbf{R} (t) - \frac{m_{1}}{m_1 + m_2} \mathbf{r}(t) as may be verified by substituting the definitions of R and r into the right-hand sides of these two equations. [ Two-body motion is planar ] The motion of two bodies with respect to each other always lies in a plane (in the center of mass frame ). Defining the linear momentum p and the angular momentum L by the equations \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{r} \times \mu \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} the rate of change of the angular momentum L equals the net torque N \mathbf{N} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \dot{\mathbf{r}} \times \mu\dot{\mathbf{r}} + \mathbf{r} \times \mu\ddot{\mathbf{r}} \, and using the property of the vector cross product that v × w = 0 for any vectors v and w pointing in the same direction, \mathbf{N} \ = \ \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} \, with F = μ d 2 r / dt 2. Introducing the assumption (true of most physical forces, as they obey Newton&apos;s strong third law of motion ) that the force between two particles acts along the line between their positions, it follows that r × F  =  0 and the angular momentum vector &apos;&apos;&apos;L&apos;&apos;&apos; is constant (conserved). Therefore, the displacement vector r and its velocity v are always in the plane perpendicular to the constant vector L. [ Central forces ] [ Classical central-force problem ] For many physical problems, the force F(r) is a central force, i.e., it is of the form \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = F(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}} where r = |r| and r̂ = r/r is the corresponding unit vector. We now have: \mu \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = {F}(r) \hat{\mathbf{r}} \, where F(r) is negative in the case of an attractive force. [ Work ] The total work done in a given time interval by the forces exerted by two bodies on each other is the same as the work done by one force applied to the total relative displacement.
