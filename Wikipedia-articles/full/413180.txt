He rose to the rank of SS- Obergruppenführer, and was involved in the administration of German concentration camps during the Second World War. [ Early years ] Pohl was born in Duisburg -Ruhrort as the son of blacksmith Hermann Otto Emil Pohl and his wife Auguste Pohl (née Seifert); he was the fifth of a total of eight children. After graduating from school in 1912, he became a full-time sailor in the Imperial Navy, being trained in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven as well as the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. During World War I, he served in the Baltic Sea region and the coast of Flanders. Pohl also attended a navy school, and became paymaster on 1 April 1918; most of his time in the navy from then on was spent in Kiel. On 30 October of the same year, he married. After the end of the war, Pohl attended courses at a trade school, and began studying law and state theory at the Christian-Albrechts-Universität in Kiel; he dropped out of university soon again though, and became paymaster for the Freikorps &quot; Brigade Löwenfeld &quot;, working in Berlin, Upper Silesia and the Ruhr basin. In 1920, like many others involved in the Lüttwitz-Kapp Putsch, he was accepted into the Weimar Republic &apos;s new navy, the Reichsmarine. Pohl was transferred to Swinemünde (now in Poland ) in 1924. [ SS career ] One year later, in 1925, Pohl became a member of the SA, then finally joined the re-founded Nazi party on 22 February 1926 as member #30842. He met Heinrich Himmler in 1933 and became his protégé. He was appointed chief of the administration department in the staff of the Reichsführer-SS ( &quot; National leader SS &quot; ) and given the rank of SS-Standartenführer on 1 February 1934 and began to influence the administration of the concentration camps. His career continued when he was made Verwaltungschef (chief of administration) and Reichskassenverwalter ( &quot; Reich treasurer &quot; ) for the SS on 1 June 1935, then initiated the Inspektion der Konzentrationslager ( &quot; Concentration Camps Inspectorate &quot; ), an organization to organize and oversee the administration of the concentration camp s. He also founded the &quot; Gesellschaft zur Förderung und Pflege deutscher Kulturdenkmäler &quot; ( &quot; Society for the preservation and fostering of German cultural monuments &quot; ), which was primarily dedicated to restoring Wewelsburg, an old castle that was supposed to be turned into a cultural and scientific headquarters of the SS at Himmler&apos;s request. The &quot; society &quot; soon became a part of Pohl&apos;s SS administration office. Pohl also left the Roman Catholic Church in 1935. [ Concentration camp administrator ] Oswald Pohl as a general of the SS. In June 1939 Pohl became chief of both the Hauptamt Verwaltung und Wirtschaft ( &quot; main bureau [for] administration and economy &quot;, part of the SS) and the Hauptamt Haushalt und Bauten ( &quot; main bureau [for] budget and construction &quot;, part of the Reich &apos; s ministry for the interior). On 1 February 1942, both institutions were combined into the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (SS-WVHA, &quot; SS main bureau for economic administration &quot; ) with Pohl in charge. In this function, Pohl oversaw the organization of the concentration camp s, deciding on the distribution of detainees to the various camps and the &quot; rental &quot; of detainees for slave labour until 1944. The exploitation of the captives rested on the Nazi principle of &quot; destruction by labour &quot;. [ May 2012 ] Pohl also directed the processing of the remains of the murdered Jews, and was directly involved in the management of the 1944 extermination of the Hungarian Jews. Late in 1944, control of the concentration camps was removed from Pohl, with the Rüstungsministerium (ministry of armament) taking over; at the same time, the responsibility for construction was also taken away from the SS-WVHA. Pohl remained in charge of the administration of the Waffen-SS for the remainder of the war. [ Postwar ] Oswald Pohl receives his sentence of death by hanging. After the end of World War II in 1945, Pohl first hid in Upper Bavaria, then near Bremen. He was captured by British troops on 27 May 1946 and sentenced to death on 3 November 1947 by an American military tribunal - following after the first Nuremberg trials - for crimes against humanity, war crime s and membership in a criminal organization as well as for mass murders and crimes committed in the concentration camps administered by the SS-WVHA while he was in charge. Without denying his knowledge of the mass killings of Jews, Pohl presented himself as a mere executive; he even had the insolence of accusing the prosecution of being guided by feelings of hatred, influenced by its Jewish representatives. [ May 2012 ] Pohl was not executed right away. Time and again Pohl appealed his death sentence. Moreover, during the Nuremberg trials, he started to see a Roman Catholic priest. Officially, Pohl had never left the Catholic Church, although he stopped visiting churches from 1935 on. In 1950, his reconversion resulted in the appearance of his book Credo. Mein Weg zu Gott ( &quot; Credo. My way to God &quot; ), which was published with permission of the Catholic Church. Pohl was hanged shortly after midnight on 8 June 1951 at Landsberg Prison in Landsberg am Lech.
