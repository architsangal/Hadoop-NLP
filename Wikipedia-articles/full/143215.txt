[ May 2009 March 2010 March 2010 ] This article refers to the act of coaching people. For other uses of the word, see Coach (disambiguation). Coaching, when referring to getting coached by a professional coach, is a teaching or training process in which an individual gets support while learning to achieve a specific personal or professional result or goal. The individual getting coached may be referred to as the client, the mentee or coachee, or they may be in an intern or apprenticeship relationship with the person coaching them. Coaching may also happen in an informal relationship between one individual who has greater experience and expertise than another and offers advice and guidance, as the other goes through a learning process. The structures, models and methodologies of coaching are numerous, and may be designed to facilitate learning new behavior for personal growth, or professional advancement. There are also forms of coaching that help the coachee improve a physical skill, like in a sport or performing art form. Some coaches use a style in which they ask questions and offer opportunities that will challenge the coachee to find answers from within him/herself. This &quot; socratic method &quot; facilitates the learner to discover answers and new ways of being based on their values, preferences and unique perspective. When coaching is aimed at facilitating psychological or emotional growth it should be differentiated from therapeutic and counseling disciplines, since a client of coaching, in most cases is considered healthy (i.e. not sick). The purpose of the coaching is to help them move forward from their present situation. Different coaching methods may be done with individuals or with groups, in person, over the phone or online. The UK&apos;s Chartered Institute of Personnel Management reports [ Taking the Temperature of Coaching, 2009 ] that 51% of companies (sample of 500) &apos;consider coaching as a key part of learning development&apos; and &apos;crucial to their strategy&apos;, with 90% reporting that they &apos;use coaching&apos;. More recent research in 2011 by Qa Research, an independent marketing research agency in the UK, found that 80% of organisations surveyed had used or are now using coaching, but also found that while 90% of organisations with over 2,000 employees had used coaching in the past five years, only 68% of companies with 230–500 employees had done the same. [ http://www.i-l-m.com/research-and-comment/9617.aspx Creating a Coaching Culture research report I-l-m.com 2011-05-19 2012-03-28 ] The basic skills of coaching are often developed in managers within organizations specifically to improve their managing and leadership abilities, rather than to apply in formal one-to-one coaching sessions. These skills can also be applied within team meetings and are then akin to the more traditional skills of group facilitation. [ 3 ] [ Origins ] Etymologically, the English term “coach” is derived from a medium of transport that traces its origins to the Hungarian word kocsi meaning “carriage” that was named after the village where it was first made. { Philosophical roots of coaching } The first use of the term coaching to mean an instructor or trainer arose around 1830 in Oxford University slang for a tutor who &quot; carries &quot; a student through an exam. Coaching thus, has been used in language to describe the process used to transport people from where they are, to where they want to be. The first use of the term in relation to sports came in 1831. { Online Etymology Dictionary, Etymonline.com } Historically the evolution of coaching has been influenced by many other fields of study including those of personal development, adult education, psychology (sports, clinical, developmental, organizational, social and industrial) and other organizational or leadership theories and practices.Since the mid-1990s, coaching has developed into a more independent discipline and professional associations such as the Association for Coaching, The International Coach Federation, and the European Coaching and Mentoring Council have helped develop a set of training standards. { Excellence in Coaching: The Industry Guide, by Jonathan Passmore, 2010 } { (Davidson &amp; Gasiorowski, 2006) } Janet Harvey, president of the International Coach Federation, was quoted in a New York Times article about the growing practice of Life Coaching, in which she traces the development of coaching to the early 1970s Human Potential Movement and credited the teachings of Werner Erhard &apos;s &quot; est Training, &quot; the popular self-motivation workshops he designed and led in the &apos;70&apos;s and early &apos;80&apos;s. { Should a Life Coach Have a Life First by Spencer Morgan, The New York Times Jan. 27, 2012http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/fashion/should-a-life-coach-have-a-life-first.html?scp=1 &amp; sq=should%20a%20life%20coach%20have%20a%20life? &amp; st=cse# } The facilitative approach to coaching in sport was pioneered by Timothy Gallwey (1974 - The Inner Game of Tennis. Random House); before this, sports coaching was (and often remains) solely a skills-based learning experience from a master in the sport. Other contexts for coaching include executive coaching, life coaching, emotional intelligence coaching and wealth coaching. [ Applications ] There are many definitions of coaching, mentoring and various styles of management and training. { Greif, S. (2007). Advances in Research on Coaching Outcomes. International Coaching Psychology Review, 2(3), 222–249 } What follows are more succinct definitions of the various forms of coaching. However, there may be overlap between many of these types of coaching activities. [ March 2010 ] Managing is making sure people do what they know how to do.Training is teaching people to do what they don’t know how to do.Mentoring is showing people how the people who are really good at doing something do it.Coaching is none of these – it is helping to identify the skills and capabilities that are within the person, and enabling them to use them to the best of their ability. Professional coaching uses a range of communication skills (such as targeted restatements) to help clients shift their perspectives and thereby discover different solutions to achieve their goals. These skills are used when coaching clients in any field. In this sense, coaching is a form of meta-profession that can apply to accompanying clients in any human endeavor, ranging from their concerns in sports and personal, professional, social, family, political, spiritual dimensions, etc. [ Life coaching ] Life coaching is a practice that helps people identify and achieve personal goals. Life coaches help clients set and reach goals using a variety of tools and techniques. Life coaches are neither therapists nor consultants; psychological intervention and business analysis are outside the scope of their work. Life coaching draws inspiration from disciplines including sociology, psychology, positive adult development, career counseling, NLP, mentor ing and other types of counseling. Contemporary life coaching can be traced to the teachings of Benjamin Karter, a college football coach turned motivational speaker of the late 1970s and early 1980s. [ Williams Patrick 2007 The history and evolution of life coaching Therapist as life coach, an introduction for counselors and other helping professionals W.W. Norton &amp; Co. (New York) http://www.lifecoachtraining.com/resources/articles/articles/The_History_and_Evolution_of_Life_Coaching_ch2.pdf ] Many Life-Coach training schools and programs are available worldwide, providing options (classroom attendance or home study) for the individual who wants to gain a certificate or diploma and paid work in the field of life coaching. Many certificates and a few diploma credential designations are available within the profession. Critics contend that life coaching is akin to psychotherapy without restrictions, oversight, or regulation. However, the Colorado General Assembly, after holding a hearing on such concerns, asserted that coaching is unlike therapy because it does not focus on examining nor diagnosing the past. { State.co.us, &quot; Digest of Bills &quot; - 2004, Professions and Occupations Retrieved April 3, 2006 } [ ADHD coaching ] [ left May 2012 ] ADHD coaching is a specialized type of life coaching that uses specific techniques geared toward working with the unique brain wiring of individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Coaches work with clients to help them better manage time, organize, set goals and complete projects. In addition to helping clients understand the impact ADHD has had on their lives, coaches can help clients develop &quot; work-arounds &quot; strategies to deal with specific challenges, and determine and use individual strengths. Coaches also help clients get a better grasp of what reasonable expectations are for them as individuals, since people with ADHD &quot; brain wiring &quot; often seem to need external mirrors for accurate self-awareness about their potential despite their impairment. [ http://jad.sagepub.com/content/8/4/221.abstract Accuracy of Self-Evaluation in Adults with ADHD Journal of Attention Disorder 2005 ] [ Business coaching ] Business coaching is a type of personal or human resource development. It provides positive support, feedback and advice to an individual or group basis to improve their personal effectiveness in the business setting. Business coaching includes executive coaching, corporate coaching and leadership coaching. The International Coach Federation, the International Coaching Council and the Worldwide Association of Business Coaches provide a membership-based association for business coaching professionals. These and other organizations train professionals to offer business coaching to business owners. [ http://blogs.wsj.com/independentstreet/2008/04/10/executive-coaching-worth-the-money/ Lorber Laura Executive Coaching – Worth the Money? The Wall Street Journal 10 April 2008 12 November 2008 ] According to a MarketData Report in 2007, an estimated 40,000 people in the U.S., work as business or life coaches, and the $2.4 billion industry is growing at rate of 18% per year. [ http://www.businesscoaching.com/business-coaching-statistics/ Businesscoaching.com Businesscoaching.com 2009-10-29 2012-03-28 ] According to the National Post, business coaching is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. [ http://vongehrconsulting.com/Finding-Answers-Blog/2010/08/why-getting-a-business-coach-is-a-good-investment/ Vongehrconsulting.com Vongehrconsulting.com 2010-09-13 2012-03-28 ] There are almost as many different ways of delivering business coaching as there are business coaches. Some offer personal support and feedback, others combine a coaching approach with practical and structured business planning and bring a disciplined accountability to the relationship. Particularly in the small business market, business coaching is as much about driving profit as it is about developing the person. Coaching is not a practice restricted to external experts or providers. Many organizations expect their senior leaders and middle managers to coach their team members toward higher levels of performance, increased job satisfaction, personal growth, and career development. Business coaching is not the same as mentoring. Mentoring involves a developmental relationship between a more experienced &quot; mentor &quot; and a less experienced partner, and typically involves sharing of advice. A business coach can act as a mentor given that he or she has adequate expertise and experience. However, mentoring is not a form of business coaching. Few link coaching activities to compensation, however, resulting in less coaching by managers. [ http://www.blessingwhite.com/CC_report.asp The Coaching Conundrum Report 2009 BlessingWhite 2009 22 January 2009 ] [ Executive coaching ] Executive coaching is designed to help facilitate professional and personal development to the point of individual growth and improved performance. Coaches need to have a strong understanding of individual differences in a work place as well as the ability to adapt their coaching style or strategies. It is suggested that those coaches who are unable to acknowledge these differences will do more harm than good. Many executive coaches have a specific area of expertise: sports; business or psychology. Regardless of specific area of focus, coaches still need to be aware of motivational needs and cultural differences. Executive coaches work their clients towards specific professional goals. These include career transition, interpersonal and professional communication, performance management, organizational effectiveness, managing career and personal changes, developing executive presence, enhancing strategic thinking, dealing effectively with conflict, and building an effective team within an organization. An industrial organizational psychologist is one example of executive coaching. [ http://siop.org siop.org siop.org 2012-03-28 ] [ Control Theory ] Multiple factors effect coaching such as motivation, cultural differences, goals, and feedback. For control theory focuses on goals and feedback. The basic premise of control theory is that people attempt to control the state of some variable by regulating their own behavior. With behavioral regulation first compare the goal with feedback. After comparing the two you can now evaluate if there is a behavior that can be changed to increase performance which will help reach your goal. [ Gregory Jane Beck, J.; Carr, A. Goals, feedback, and self-regulation: Control theory as a natural framework for executive coaching. Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research 3/11 2011 March 63 1 26–38 10.1037/a0023398 http://psycnet.apa.org.suproxy.su.edu/journals/cpb/63/1/26.html 23 February 2012 ] [ DELTA Approach ] [ May 2012 ] [ May 2012 ] The DELTA Approach to executive coaching was developed to be value sensitive when it came to coaching. DELTA coaching is an acronym that consists of five main elements. DELTA, (D) Determining cultural values, (E) Employing typical coaching techniques, (L) Looking and listening for motivational needs and deficiencies, (T) Tailoring coaching techniques to motivational needs and cultural values, and (A) Assessing the effectiveness of these. [ Coultas Chris Bedwell, W.; Burke, S.; Salas, E. Values sensitive coaching: The DELTA approach to coaching culturally diverse executives. Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research 9/11 2011 September 63 3 149–161 10.1037/a0025603 http://psycnet.apa.org.suproxy.su.edu/journals/cpb/63/3/149.html 23 February 2012 ] [ DELTA Determining Cultural Values ] When determining the cultural values it is best to review Hofstede&apos;s dimensions of national culture. [ DELTA Employing Typical Coaching Techniques ] Employing typical coaching techniques can be broken down into four main elements: (1) a one-on-one relationship, (2) monitoring the coachee’s performance and other work-relevant behaviors, (3) setting goals based on the behaviors monitored, and (4) providing feedback throughout the relationship.Feedback and feedback interventions are one of the most common and well-known coaching techniques. The main goal of feedback is to provide information in regards to the coachee’s performance with the goal in mind to improve one’s performance. [ DELTA Looking and Listening ] Looking and listening for motivational needs and deficienciesAll motivational theories, strategies, and techniques in essence, use feedback and goal setting to drive the personal and professional development of the coachee. A good coach will be able to use these techniques as well as highlight performance and goal deficiencies in the coachee’s professional life. [ DELTA Tailoring Coaching Techniques ] Executive coaching is highly individualized by nature because of this, the coach must be able to deal with differences and adapt accordingly. All coaches must be able to adjust their coaching strategies to maximize motivation of clients. Motivation varies from person to person usually related to culture. Determining if the culture leans more toward individualism or collectivism would allow the coach to determine the type of feedback necessary for motivation. A more individual focused culture might benefit more from self efficacy. While collective cultures would benefit more by focusing on the group’s efficacy or group feedback. [ DELTA Assessing the effectiveness ] Individuals are not motivated by the same thing, exploring different means of motivating and assessing how well they work is the final step in the DELTA process. Compensations, rewards, and need satisfaction are all effective tasks for motivating. [ Expat and global executive coaching ] Expat and global Executive coaching deals specifically with the unique set of challenges created from crossing cultures following an international or domestic relocation. This niche of coaching tends to center around adapting to a new culture, identity issues created within relocating families, difficulties attaining professional goals amidst a changing political and social structure, and other social and personal hurdles unique to each individual. This method of coaching is either individual, or group-based and helps the client gain fulfillment, success and a sense of identity in the areas that are coached. [ May 2011 ] [ Career coaching ] Career coaching focuses on work and career or issues around careers. It is similar in nature to career counseling and traditional counseling. Career coaching is not to be confused with life coaching, which concentrates on personal development. Another common term for a career coach is career guide, although career guides typically use techniques drawn not only from coaching, but also mentoring, advising and consulting. For instance, skills coaching and holistic counseling are increasingly of equal importance to careers guidance in the UK. { Professor Jenny Bimrose, &apos;The Changing Context of Career Practice: Guidance, Counselling or Coaching?&apos; } [ Financial coaching ] Financial coaching is an emerging form of coaching that focuses on helping clients attain their financial goals. In contrast to financial counselors and educators, financial coaches do not provide financial advice to clients, nor do they focus on providing financial information. As such, financial coaches do not need to be experts in personal finance. At its most basic, financial coaching is a one-on-one relationship in which the coach provides encouragement and holds the client accountable to financial goals. Financial coaching is rooted in the fact that although many people have financial goals and aspirations, they often struggle to attain them. Recognizing the array of challenges inherent in behavior change, including all too human tendencies to procrastinate and overemphasize short-term gains over long-term wellbeing, financial coaches monitor clients’ progress over time. This monitoring function holds clients accountable and is hypothesized to boost clients’ self-control and willpower. [ May 2011 ] Previous studies in psychology indicate that individuals are much more likely to follow through on tasks when they are monitored by others, rather than when they attempt to ‘self-monitor.’ [ May 2011 ] Financial coaches also provide encouragement and support, which may also facilitate goal attainment. Although early research links financial coaching to improvements in client outcomes, much more rigorous analysis is necessary before any causal linkages can be established. [ May 2011 ] [ Personal coaching ] Personal coaching is a process which is designed and defined in a relationship agreement between a client and a coach. It is based on the client&apos;s expressed interests, goals and objectives. A professional coach may use inquiry, reflection, requests and discussion to help clients identify personal and/or business and/or relationship goals, and develop action plans intended to achieve those goals. The client takes action, and the coach may assist, but never leads or does more than the client. Professional coaching is not counseling, therapy or consulting. [ Rogers Jenny 2008 Coaching skills - a Handbook Open University Press. 2nd Edn. ] These different skill sets and approaches to change may be adjunct skills and professions. [ Health coaching ] [ Health coaching ] In the world of health and wellness, a health coach is an emerging new role. Health coaching is becoming recognized as a new way to help individuals &quot; manage &quot; their illnesses and conditions, especially those of a chronic nature. [ May 2011 ] The coach will use special techniques, personal experience, expertise and encouragement to assist the coachee in bringing his/her behavioral changes about. [ Sports coaching ] { Marylebone Cricket Club coaching books } [ Coach (sport) ] In sports, a coach is an individual that teaches and supervises, which involved in the direction, instruction and training of the on-field operations of an athletic team or of individual athletes. This type of coach gets involved in all the aspects of the sport, including physical and mental player development. Sports coaches train their athletes to become better at the physical components of the game, while others train athletes to become better at the mental components of the game. The coach is assumed to know more about the sport, and have more previous experience and knowledge. The coach’s job is to transfer as much of this knowledge and experience to the players to develop the most skilled athletes. When coaching its entail to the application of sport tactics and strategies during the game or contests itself, and usually entails substitution of players and other such actions as needed. Many coaches work at setting their own rules and regulations. They are expected to provide and maintain a drug free environment, act as a role model both on and off of the fields and courts. Coaches must ensure that their players are safe and protected during games as well as during practices. [17] [18] [ Dating coaching ] [ Dating coach ] Dating coaches are coaches whose job is to direct and train people to improve their success in dating and relationships.A dating coach directs and trains his/her clients on various aspects of meeting and attracting long-term partners and meeting more compatible prospects. The focus of most programs is on confident and congruent communication. Dating coaches may focus on topics important to the art of dating : interpersonal skills, flirting, psychology, sociology, compatibility, fashion and recreation al activities. Neil Strauss in The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists also focuses on neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), theories of persuasion, history and evolutionary biology, body language, humor and street smarts. [ Conflict coaching ] Conflict coaching may be used in an organizational context or in matrimonial and other relationship matters. Like many other techniques of this nature, it is premised on the view that conflict provides an opportunity to improve relationships, to create mutually satisfactory solutions and attain other positive outcomes when differences arise between and among people. [ May 2011 ] [ Victimisation coaching ] Victimisation Coaching is a type of life coaching that educates people who consider themselves as victims of crime or those who fear victimisation. Coaches work with groups of people to assist them on how to identify and approach potentially hazardous situations. [ Christian coaching ] Christian coaching is becoming more common among religious organizations and churches. A Christian coach is not a pastor or counselor, (although they may also be credentialed in those disciplines), but rather someone who has been professionally trained to address specific coaching goals from a distinctively Christian or biblical perspective. Although training courses exist, there is no single regulatory body for Christian coaching. Some of these training programs feature best-selling Christian authors, leaders, speakers or pastors. Several of these authors have developed their own coach training programs, such as Henry Cloud and John Townsend [ April 2012 ], or John C. Maxwell. [ Coaching ethics and standards ] One of the challenges in the field of coaching is upholding levels of professionalism, standards and ethics. To this end, many of the coaching bodies and organizations have codes of ethics and member standards and criteria according to which they hold their members accountable in order to protect coaching clients&apos; interests. [ May 2011 ] [ Viability as a career ] While coaching as a career has become increasing popular over the past 15 years, fueled by the work of Thomas J. Leonard, there are differing viewpoints concerning how viable a career in coaching is given the competitive marketplace. Suzanne Falter-Barnes and David Wood demonstrated, in a 2007 Survey of 3,000 coaches, that more than 50% of coaches are earning under $10,000 a year. [ http://www.solutionbox.com/surveyresults2.htm Coach Career Survey 2007 SolutionBox 2007 ] However, the survey canvassed a mixture of full-time and part-time coaches.
