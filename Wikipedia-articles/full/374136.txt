[ Coleman Brian 2007 Check The Technique : Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies Villard New York 978-0-8129-7775-2 ] [ Background ] In contrast to their previous album, Paul&apos;s Boutique, the Beastie Boys returned somewhat stylistically to their punk rock roots on Check Your Head, playing their own instruments for the first time on record since their early EPs (although they did provide live instrumentation on at least two songs on Paul&apos;s Boutique). Hence photographer Glen E. Friedman &apos;s idea to shoot photos with their instrument cases (one of which became the cover). Supposedly, a trading card with Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. from a set of Desert Storm trading cards was the inspiration for the title.

The album also marks the first appearance of long time collaborator keyboardist Money Mark. The Beastie Boys toured with the Rollins Band and Cypress Hill in early 1992 to support Check Your Head.
