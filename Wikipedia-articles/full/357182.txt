[ Domestic issues ] As president of the new Republic, Victoria was in charge of rebuilding an economy devastated by the long war of independence and the economic blockade promoted by the Spanish crown. To resolve the lack of supplies, a result of the trade embargo, he created the country&apos;s merchant marine, which opened trade routes with the ports of the American countries that had recognized the national independence and with which diplomatic relations were established. However his main concern was to achieve recognition from European countries. The government of Victoria was hampered by severe financial problems. His expenses averaged $18  million pesos annually, but he was only collecting half that amount in revenues. [ Guadalupe Victoria – Presidente desconocido http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/264-guadalupe-victoria-presidente-desconocido ] In order to resolve that problem, Victoria was forced to seek foreign aid. The United Kingdom, knowing how hard-pressed Victoria was (the Army alone accounted for $12  million pesos of the budget), persuaded him to accept two loans, each of over $3  million pounds. These loans, negotiated through banking houses such as Barclay and Goldschmidt, averted bankruptcy and helped retain social peace, factors that undoubtedly enabled Victoria to serve out his full term. Despite these financial problems, there were some highly positive aspects to Victoria&apos;s administration. Two of the first president&apos;s most positive achievements were the establishment of the National Treasury and the abolition of slavery, which were declared on 16 September 1825, when he held for the first time El Grito de Dolores. [ Aguirre Eugenio Victoria Spanish 2005 319 Booket 978-607-07-0215-0 ] In addition, he established the Military Academy, restored Mexico City, [ Aguirre Eugenio Victoria Spanish 2005 291 Booket 978-607-07-0215-0 ] improved education, accorded amnesty to political prisoners, laid plans for a canal in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, opened new ports for shipping, began construction on the National Museum, garrisoned Yucatán to thwart a contemplated Cuba-based Spanish invasion, and unmasked a conspiracy led by a monk named Joaquin Arenas to restore Spanish rule. Victoria also facilitated the activities of the Lancasterian Society, which was dedicated to education, and he created the Naval Force that enabled his greatest achievement: the complete independence of Mexico, when on 18 November 1825, general Miguel Barragán took the last Spanish stronghold, the fortress of San Juan de Ulúa in Veracruz. In politics, his actions were conciliatory. He tried to apply policies that would attract different sides and formed his cabinet with prominent members of the different factions. However, the old conflicts since the days of Iturbide resurfaced. Victoria faced the contradiction of religious intolerance against freedom of speech and press, which were declared in the Constitution, and which he scrupulously observed. On 20 December 1827, he decreed the expulsion of Spaniards of the Republic. [ http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1827_118/Ley_Expulsi_n_de_espa_oles.shtml Ley. Expulsión de españoles. Spanish October 5, 2010 ] The suppressed rebellion of Joaquín Arenas sparked a wave of outrage against the wealthy Spaniards who had sponsored it. Though Lucas Alaman, his Secretary of the Interior, tried to dissuade him, American ambassador Joel R. Poinsett, encouraged Victoria to order the expulsion of the Spaniards, which caused serious economic problems, because most of those expelled were traders who brought their fortunes to Spain.

[ Spanish reconquest of Mexico ] The War of Independence ruined fields, towns, trade and mining. The government had no effective ways of collecting additional customs taxes, and the government operated under debit and salary arrears. Under these conditions it was difficult to undertake an effective strategy for the surrender of San Juan de Ulúa. [ Mar e independencia, 1825. http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina%3Darmada-articulo ] Despite this, Victoria&apos;s government bought some boats to form the basis of the first Mexican Navy. They included the schooners Iguala, Anáhuac, Chalco, Chapala, Texcoco, Orizaba, Campechana and Zumpango. The schooners Tampico, Papaloapan and Tlaxcalteca were added later. Finally, on 23 November 1825, frigate Captain Pedro Sainz de Baranda achieved the capitulation of San Juan de Ulúa, the last Spanish bastion in Mexico. [ 23 de noviembre.

[ Viaje por la historia de México. http://www.sep.gob.mx/work/models/sep1/Resource/564/1/images/16.%20Las%20invasiones%20norteamericanas.pdf ] On 18 August 1824, the General Colonization Law was issued to populate the Northern Territories of ( Alta California, Nuevo México and the north side of the state of Coahuila y Texas ). The decree left the administration of public lands in the hands of the states. On 24 March 1825, the congress passed a law to open the doors to foreign colonization fully; the law gave the settlers land privileges and exemption from taxes for ten years. [ Moisés Austin obtiene permiso para colonizar Texas. http://memoriapoliticademexico.org/Efemerides/1/17011821.html ] The immigration of Americans was abundant and communities quickly formed that retained their language, religion and customs, resulting in weak links with the rest of the country. They disobeyed the laws and continued slavery in Mexican territory. In 1826, the first attempt at separatism was made when empresario Haden Edwards declared independence from state of Coahuila y Texas and created the Republic of Fredonia near Nacogdoches, Texas. The rebellion was quickly quelled. As a direct result of Edwards&apos;s actions, Victoria authorized an extensive expedition, conducted by General Manuel Mier y Teran, to inspect the Texas settlements and recommend a future course of action. Mier y Teran&apos;s reports led to the Laws of April 6, 1830, which severely restricted immigration into Texas. { Morton (1947), p. 34. } [ Nicolás Bravo&apos;s rebellion ] Oil of Nicolás Bravo. During his term, Guadalupe Victoria faced several attempted coups d&apos;état against his government. Seven months after starting his administration the first attempt was discovered. Another was discovered in late 1827. On 23 December 1827, the Scottish Lodge declared the Plan of Montaño in Tulancingo, (now state of Hidalgo ) which was based on 4 points: [ http://books.google.com.mx/books?id%3Drq0j6Lp9Op8C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA73%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA73%26amp%3Bdq%3D20%2Bde%2Bdiciembre%2Bde%2B1827%26amp%3Bsource%3Dbl%26amp%3Bots%3DL4PrYbvIjC%26amp%3Bsig%3DzyXFoNDApUjLvTV4URKHLn8-N3U%26amp%3Bhl%3Des%26amp%3Bei%3D_vW0TJimD4aEtgPYo7GdDA%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Boi%3Dbook_result%26amp%3Bct%3Dresult%26amp%3Bresnum%3D9%26amp%3Bved%3D0CDMQ6AEwCA#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D20%20de%20diciembre%20de%201827%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse La expulsión de los españoles de México y su destino incierto, 1821–1836. 72–73 Spanish October 12, 2010 ] The extinction of secret societies. The change of government. The expulsion of U.S. ambassador Joel R. Poinsett. Strict compliance of the Constitution. Vice-President Nicolás Bravo, head of the revolt, claimed that his sole purpose was to release the Congress and the government of Victoria to the influence of the Yorker Lodge. The plan called mainly for the reorganization of government, which had showed serious deficiencies in the control of public revenues and expulsion of the United States representative on the grounds that country meddled in domestic affairs. (Joel R. Poinsett was expelled from Mexico on 3 January 1830 for that reason).

Nicolás Bravo was expelled from the country while other mutineers were imprisoned. [ Mutiny of La Acordada ] Lithograph of El Parian, 19th century. The Mutiny of La Acordada ( [ no Motín de la Acordada ] ), was a revolt staged on 30 November 1828 by General Jose Maria Lobato, Colonel Santiago García and Lorenzo de Zavala against the government of Guadalupe Victoria when they learned that he supported the candidacy of Manuel Gómez Pedraza in presidential elections. [ Riva Palacios Vicente México á través de los siglos. G. S. López 1940 México ] For the elections of 1828, the Yorker Lodge presented as candidate to the Minister of War Manuel Gómez Pedraza. The Scottish Lodge presented as candidate to Vicente Guerrero, independence hero and victor in the last conspiracy against government. The elections were held on 1 September 1828, and the winner was Manuel Gómez Pedraza. Vicente Guerrero rejected the results and organized a revolution.

Meanwhile, Gómez Pedraza fled from Mexico City, waiving his right to the presidency. That was seized upon by the mob which went to El Parian, the core of Mexican trade, and began looting and burning shops and stores, ruining hundreds of Spanish, Mexican and foreign traders. As a result, in early 1829, Congress annulled the election of 1828 and elected Vicente Guerrero as President. Victoria delivered the presidency to him when his term ended on 1 April 1829. [ Foreign affairs ] One of the main goals of Guadalupe Victoria was recognition of Mexico as an independent nation by the principal foreign powers. He finally got that recognition following the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Federal Republic of Central America, and Gran Colombia. That reduced the problems caused by the economic embargo imposed by the Spanish crown. The economic problems were further reduced when several British companies began mining operations in Mexico, which resulted in a large influx of capitals. He also ratified the contents of the Adams–Onís Treaty and thus the border with the United States. Victoria declared that no proposals would be heard from Spain until it recognized Mexican independence and the form of government established and agreed to, and never ask for indemnification for the loss of Mexico.

He also provided financial assistance to Simón Bolívar to help obtain Peru&apos;s total independence from Spain. [ Post-presidential years and death ] After completing his term, Victoria retired from public life to manage personal affairs in his hacienda El Jobo in Veracruz. When Victoria gave the presidency to his successor, Vicente Guerrero, he said: [ &quot;...I ratified the promise to withdraw from all public business as ex president, but if the country were in danger and were needed to leave everything to save it, you know I will not hesitate to sacrifice me... &quot; ] In 1832, the Government of the Republic, aware of his diplomatic and negotiating skills, asked him to assist in the pacification of Santa Anna, who had taken up arms to demand that the presidency of the Republic be delivered to General Manuel Gómez Pedraza.

At the same time, he fought against rebellions in Veracruz and Oaxaca. While serving as Senator his health began to seriously deteriorate and he began having recurrent seizures which prevented him from completing his term as Governor of Puebla, a position he held for less than five months. Victoria returned to the Senate and in 1835 was elected president of the Senate. [ Aguirre Eugenio Victoria Spanish 2005 542 Booket 978-607-07-0215-0 ] At that time he undertook a vigorous fight against a proposal that sought to change the federal republic to a centralized republic. A few days before returning to the Senate, in Puebla, he stated his position: [ &quot; Twenty three years I have fought for your same cause and if new dangers will call me for your defense, you know that my vote is irrevocable: Federation or death. &quot; ] In November 1836 he was appointed military commander of Veracruz, but he resigned in December of that year to show disagreement to the proclamation of the first Central Republic. [ Aguirre Eugenio Victoria Spanish 2005 550 Booket 978-607-07-0215-0 ] In 1838, his diplomatic intervention was crucial to avoid a war against the French in the incident known as the Pastry War. On 9 March 1839, he was successful with the signing of a peace treaty with France. That was his last public activity.

He moved to the Castle of Perote to receive medical treatment and he died there on 21 March 1843. He was buried there. Guadalupe Victoria was declared by Congress Benemérito de la Patria (Worthy of the Nation) on 25 August 1843, and his name was written in golden letters in the session hall of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1863, his remains were moved to Puebla by General Alejandro García and were placed in the Column of Independence in Mexico City. On 15 August 2010, in celebration of the bicentennial of the beginning of the independence of Mexico, his remains were moved to National Palace and remained on display until 20 July 2011, when were returned to the Column of Independence.
