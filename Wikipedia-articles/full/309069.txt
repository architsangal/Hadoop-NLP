In 2010, former Playboy Playmate Izabella St. James, in her memoir &quot; Bunny Tales: Behind Closed Doors at the Playboy Mansion &quot;, wrote that the house was in need of renovation: &quot; Everything in the Mansion felt old and stale, and Archie the house dog would regularly relieve himself on the hallway curtains, adding a powerful whiff of urine to the general scent of decay. &quot; The house next door is a mirror image of the Mansion layout, only smaller. Hefner purchased the neighboring building in 1996 and it is home to his separated wife Kimberley Conrad and their children together. Hefner and Conrad married in 1989 and separated in 1998. According to the Wall Street Journal, Hefner and his wife announced in March 2009 that they are listing Mrs. Hefner&apos;s home for sale at $US28 million.
