[ 1953 12 15 ] John Marc DeMatteis (born December 15, 1953) is an American writer of comic books. [ Biography ] [ Early career ] Born in Brooklyn, DeMatteis graduated from Midwood High School [ September 2009 ] and Empire State College [ September 2009 ]. He worked as a music critic before getting his start in comic books at DC Comics in the late 1970s. His first published story for the company was &quot; The Blood Boat! &quot; in Weird War Tales #70 (Dec. 1978). { J. M. DeMatteis at the } { Grand Comics Database } He contributed to the company&apos;s line of horror comics notably with the creation of the Creature Commandos in Weird War Tales #93 (Nov. 1980) [ Manning Matthew K.

DeMatteis unveiled vampire/vampire hunter Andrew Bennett with the help of artist Tom Sutton in The House of Mystery #290. &quot; } He briefly wrote the Aquaman feature in Adventure Comics as well. { Manning &quot; 1980s &quot; in Dolan, p. 187: &quot; With issue #475, fan favorite Aquaman was added to the [Adventure Comics] lineup, and his first installment was written by J. M. DeMatteis and illustrated by Dick Giordano. &quot; } DeMatteis and artist Brian Bolland produced a backup story titled &quot; Falling Down to Heaven &quot; in Madame Xanadu, DC&apos;s first attempt at marketing comics specifically to the &quot; direct market &quot; of fans and collectors. [ Michael Catron Catron Michael DC Taps Fan Market for Madame Xanadu Amazing Heroes 1 June 1981 25 Madame Xanadu, a 32-page/$1.00 comic that marks DC&apos;s first attempt at marketing comics specifically to fans and collectors, went on sale in early April. The book contains a 25-page tale by Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers entitled &quot; Dance for Two Demons &quot; and a seven-page fantasy story by J. Marc DeMatteis and Brian Bolland. ] He began writing for Marvel Comics in 1980 on The Defenders, and had a lengthy run on Captain America, paired with penciler Mike Zeck. [ 1980s ] In 1987, DeMatteis and Zeck re-teamed for the &quot; Kraven&apos;s Last Hunt &quot; arc that ran throughout Marvel&apos;s then three Spider-Man titles. DeMatteis and illustrator Jon J. Muth created the graphic novel Moonshadow, for Marvel&apos;s Epic line. DeMatteis followed this with the 1986 Doctor Strange graphic novel Into Shambhala drawn by Dan Green and Blood: A Tale, a hallucinatory vampire story drawn by Kent Williams. Moving back to DC, DeMatteis succeeded Gerry Conway as writer of the superhero-team title Justice League of America. When that series was cancelled { Manning &quot; 1980s &quot; in Dolan, p. 226: &quot; Alongside artist Luke McDonnell, DeMatteis crafted a dramatic four-part finale to the first series of DC&apos;s premier team of superheroes. &quot; } in the wake of the company-wide crossover Legends, DeMatteis stayed through its relaunch as Justice League International, { Manning &quot; 1980s &quot; in Dolan, p. 228: &quot; It was clear that the [Justice League] needed a major overhaul. But no one quite expected how drastic the transformation would truly be in the hands of writers Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis and artist Kevin Maguire. &quot; } scripting over the plots of Keith Giffen. JLI took such lesser-known DC characters as Martian Manhunter, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Mister Miracle, Captain Atom, and Power Girl and turned the then-current preoccupation with &quot; grim &apos;n&apos; gritty &quot; superheroes on its head. The lighthearted series emphasized the absurd aspects of people with strange powers, wearing colorful costumes, volunteering to fight evildoers. While the League had its serious side and often faced world-threatening villain s, it also featured such characters as the lovably inept G&apos;Nort, the worst Green Lantern in the Corps; Mr. Nebula, the interplanetary decorator; the Injustice League, a bunch of bumbling losers; and a flock of homicidal penguin s who had been hybridized with piranha s. The success of Justice League International led to a spinoff in 1989 titled Justice League Europe also co-written with Giffen and featuring art by Bart Sears. { Manning &quot; 1980s &quot; in Dolan, p. 239: &quot; Spinning out of the pages of Justice League International, an offshoot of the Justice League set up camp in Paris. Written by Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis with art by Bart Sears. &quot; } [ 1990s ] The Giffen/DeMatteis team worked on Justice League for five years and closed out their run with the &quot; Breakdowns &quot; storyline in 1991 and 1992. { Manning &quot; 1990s &quot; in Dolan, p. 251: &quot; The lauded Giffen/DeMatteis era of the Justice League came to a dramatic close with &quot; Breakdowns &quot;, a sixteen-part storyline that crossed through the pages of both Justice Leaue America and Justice League Europe. &quot; } DeMatteis scripted Justice League spin-offs such as solo series for Mister Miracle and Doctor Fate. Back at Marvel, DeMatteis again succeeded Conway, this time as writer of The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1991, taking the series in a grimmer, more psychologically oriented direction. In collaboration with regular artist Sal Buscema, DeMatteis&apos; story arc The Child Within (#178-184) featured the return of the Harry Osborn Green Goblin. Spider-Man&apos;s battle with the Goblin continued in The Osborn Legacy in #189 and came to an end when Harry died in The Best Of Enemies! (#200). In the mid-1990s, DeMatteis took over from David Michelinie as writer of The Amazing Spider-Man for a run that included the apparent death of Peter Parker &apos;s Aunt May and the beginnings of the &quot; Clone Saga &quot; arc. DeMatteis as well worked on such characters as Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Man-Thing, and the Silver Surfer. DeMatteis helped launch DC&apos;s mature-audience Vertigo imprint, writing the graphic novels Mercy and Farewell, Moonshadow (a sequel to the Epic Comics series), the miniseries The Last One, and the 15-issue series Seekers Into The Mystery, the story of a Hollywood screenwriter on a journey of self-discovery and the search for universal truths. DeMatteis wrote an autobiographical, digest-sized miniseries Brooklyn Dreams, published by DC&apos;s Paradox Press imprint. DeMatteis&apos; most personal work, it was later collected in one volume under the Vertigo imprint. [ 21st century ] In the 2000s, DeMatteis redefined the Spectre, through the character of Hal Jordan, as a spirit of redemption rather than of vengeance. DeMatteis co-scripted the &quot; Gods of Gotham &quot; storyline in Wonder Woman #164-166 (Jan-March 2001) with Phil Jimenez. { Cowsill, Alan &quot; 2000s &quot; in Dolan, p. 298 &quot; The &apos;Gods of Gotham&apos; storyline marked the start of Phil Jimenez&apos;s run on the series as artist and writer (with J. M. DeMatteis on board as co-scripter for the first arc). &quot; } In 2003, with Giffen, he revived the Justice League International for the mini-series Formerly Known as the Justice League. { Cowsill &quot; 2000s &quot; in Dolan, p. 311: &quot; In 2003, writers J. M. DeMatteis and Keith Giffen and original artist Kevin Maguire worked on a six-part series reuniting [their version of] the team. &quot; } The series won Giffen, DeMatteis and artist Kevin Maguire an Eisner Award. { 2004 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards } The team followed this with &quot; I Can&apos;t Believe It&apos;s Not the Justice League &quot; arc in JLA Classified and, at Marvel, a five-issue run of The Defenders. In 2006, DeMatteis and Giffen began work on two original superhero comedy series, Hero Squared and Planetary Brigade for Boom! Studios. { Talking &quot; Abadazad, &quot; &quot; Hero Squared, &quot; Music and More with J.M DeMatteis, } { Comic Book Resources, May 1, 2006 } DeMatteis teamed with veteran artist Mike Ploog to create the CrossGen fantasy comic Abadazad (May 2004).

[ October 2008 ] In 2008, DeMatteis became editor-in-chief of Ardden Entertainment, guiding the launch of a new Flash Gordon comic book series. In 2009, he wrote a five-issue comic book limited series, illustrated by Mike Cavallaro, The Life and Times of Savior 28, which was released by IDW Publishing in 2009. { Word Balloon: J.M.
