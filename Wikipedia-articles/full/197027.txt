[ http://www.uea.ac.uk/about/History UEA - History 2008-10-03 2007 University of East Anglia ] It was established in 1963, and is a founder-member of the 1994 Group of research-intensive universities. [ http://www.1994group.ac.uk/memberinstitutions.php 1994 Group Member Institutions 2008-05-05 ] [ History ] { Elizabeth Fry, is now home to } { Norwich Law School } The University of East Anglia opened in October 1963, not on its present campus, but in the &quot; University Village &quot; on the other side of Earlham Road, a collection of prefabricated structures designed for 1200 students, laid out by the local architectural firm Feilden and Mawson. There were no residences. The Vice-Chancellor and administration were based in nearby Earlham Hall. In 1961, the first vice-chancellor, Frank Thistlethwaite, had approached Denys Lasdun, an adherent of the &quot; New Brutalist &quot; trend in architecture, who was at that time building Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, to produce designs for the permanent campus. The site chosen was on the western edge of the city, on the south side of Earlham Road. The land, formerly part of the Earlham Hall estate was at that time occupied by a golf course. [ Wilson Bill Nikolaus Pevsner Norfolk 1: Norwich and North- East second Buildings of England 2007 Yale University Press 0-300-09607-0 347 ] Lasdun unveiled a model and an outline plan at a press conference in April 1963, but it took another year to produce detailed plans, which diverged considerably from the model. The first buildings did not open until late 1966. Lasdun put all the teaching and research functions into the &quot; teaching wall &quot;, a single block 460 metres long following the contour of the site. Alongside this he built a walkway, giving access to the various entrances of the wall, with access roads beneath. Attached to the other, southern, side of the walkway he added the groups of terraced residences that became known as &quot; Ziggurats &quot;. In 1968, Lasdun was replaced as architect by Bernard Feilden, who completed the teaching wall and library, and created an arena-shaped square as a social space of a kind not envisioned in his predecessor&apos;s plans. [ Check digit (9) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] { 139–149 } In the mid-1970s, extraction of gravel in the valley of the River Yare, which runs to the south of the campus, resulted in the university acquiring its own lake or &quot; Broad &quot; as it is often referred to. At more or less the same time, a bequest of tribal art and 20th century painting and sculpture, by artists such as Francis Bacon and Henry Moore, from Sir Robert and Lady Lisa Sainsbury resulted in the construction of the striking Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the western end of the main teaching wall, one of the first major works of architect Norman Foster. In 2005 the university, in partnership with the University of Essex, and with the support of Suffolk County Council, the East of England Development Agency, Ipswich Borough Council, Suffolk College, and the Learning and Skills Council, secured £15  million funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England for the creation of a new campus in the Waterfront area of Ipswich, called University Campus Suffolk or UCS.

In January 2010 the University of East Anglia opened UEA London, a purpose built teaching facility near Liverpool Street Station in the City of London to provide facilities for more than 1,000 students. { http://www.uea.ac.uk/london } [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-12962667 Norwich university opens London campus 3 May 2012 BBC News 4 April 2011 ] [ Climatic Research Unit hacking ] [ Climatic Research Unit hacking incident ] In November 2009, computer servers at the Climatic Research Unit (a research institute within the University) were hacked, and the stolen information made public. Over 1,000 emails, 2,000 documents, and source code were released. Because the Climate Research Unit is a major repository for data supporting the idea of man-made global warming their release directly prior to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference attracted international attention and led to calls for an inquiry. { &quot; Climategate: Scientists, Politicians War Over Hacked E-Mails &quot; } [ Campus ] Constable Terrace, one of the university&apos;s halls of residence Notable features of the UEA campus include Earlham Hall which is home to Norwich Law School, the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the western end of the main teaching wall designed by Norman Foster to house the art collection of Sir Robert and Lady Lisa Sainsbury, and &quot; Sportspark &quot;, a multi-sports facilities built in 2001 thanks to a £14.5  million grant from Sport England Lottery Fund.

In terms of accommodation the university campus has eight en-suite residences, namely Constable Terrace, Nelson Court, and Britten, Colman, Victory, Kett, Browne, and Paston Houses. The residences are named after Horatio Nelson, John Constable, Benjamin Britten, Jeremiah Colman, Horatio Nelson&apos;s ship HMS Victory, Robert Kett, Sir Thomas Browne and the Paston family who wrote the Paston Letters. The university also offers en-suite accommodation at the University Village, located next to the university campus. There are also four non en-suite residences on campus, namely Norfolk and Suffolk Terraces also known as the &quot; Ziggurats &quot;, and Orwell and Wolfson Close. The university also manages Mary Chapman Court, a hall of residence in Norwich city centre. [ http://www.ueaaccommodation.co.uk/standard.asp Mary Chapman Court 2008-08-10 ] Facilities on campus include the &quot; Union Pub and Bar &quot;, a concert and disco venue called &quot; The LCR &quot;, a canteen called &quot; Zest &quot;, a cafe/coffee shop called &quot; The Blend &quot;, a bar/coffee shop called &quot; The Hive &quot;, a graduate bar called the &quot; Graduate Students Club &quot; and &quot; The Street &quot; with a 24-hour launderette, the Union Food Outlet, Union Paper Shop, Union Post Office, a coffee shop called &quot; Cafe Direct &quot;, branches of NatWest and Barclays, and a Waterstone&apos;s book shop. Most of these are situated in the centre of the campus, next to The Square. The campus is linked to the city centre and railway station by frequent buses, operated by First, via Unthank Road or Earlham Road. First also operate frequent buses from the campus to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and to Bowthorpe.

In 2008 two academics from UEA, Professor of Development Studies Katrina Brown and Professor of Economic Behaviour and Decision Theory Graham Loomes, were among six scholars in the UK chosen to receive fellowships from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) to allow them to carry out cutting-edge research in social science. { http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2008/dec/homepagenews/socialscience/ } Professor Ian Diamond, ESRC Chief Executive, said &quot; These fellowships are designed to support leading social scientists working in the UK. The scheme offers Fellows with an outstanding track record in research, the time and funding to pursue an exciting research agenda, and to carry out innovative and creative work that will have economic, social land policy impacts. Each of the six successful individuals has an international reputation as a leader in their respective fields. &quot; { http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/PO/releases/2008/december/prof_fells.aspx?ComponentId=29991 &amp; SourcePageId=20654/ } [ Admissions ] According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), in 2004 the proportion of students admitted to the University from independent schools was 11.6%.

A more recent society, The Campus Sustainability Initiative, founded The Sustainability Initiative Fund, where UEA students each pay a £1 per year sustainability fee with the proceeds going towards sustainable projects on campus such as implementing renewable energies or energy conservation projects. The initiative was supported by UEA students in a campus referendum with a 78 percent majority, and the project was inspired by a similar initiative at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The UEA Student Union operates many of the services on the university campus, which are open to all members of the university community and the general public. Connected to both &quot; The Street &quot; and &quot; The Square &quot; is one of the most popular Union venues, the &quot; Union Pub and Bar &quot;, which underwent extension and refurbishment at the cost of £1.2  million in 2002. Other bars include &quot; The Hive &quot; (which, due to efforts from the Students&apos; Union, was refurbished for the start of the 2004/05 academic year), and the &quot; Graduate Students Club &quot;.
