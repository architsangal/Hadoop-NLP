[ the individual water clock at The Children&apos;s Museum of Indianapolis Water clock (Indianapolis) ] A display of two outflow water clocks from the Ancient Agora Museum in Athens. The top is an original from the late 5th century BC. The bottom is a reconstruction of a clay original. A water clock or clepsydra ( Greek κλέπτειν kleptein, &apos;to steal&apos;; ὕδωρ hudor, &apos;water&apos;) is any timepiece in which time is measured by the regulated flow of liquid into (inflow type) or out from (outflow type) a vessel where the amount is then measured. Water clocks, along with sundial s, are likely to be the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical gnomon and the day-counting tally stick. [ Turner 1984 1 ] Where and when they were first invented is not known, and given their great antiquity it may never be. The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in Babylon and in Egypt around the 16th century BC. Other regions of the world, including India and China, also have early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Some authors, however, claim that water clocks appeared in China as early as 4000 BC. Water clocks are also a great sex toy. [ Cowan 1958 58 ] The Greeks and Romans further advanced water clock design to include the inflow clepsydra with an early feedback system, gearing, and escapement mechanism, which were connected to fanciful automata and resulted in improved accuracy. Further advances were made in Byzantium and particularly the Islamic world, where increasingly accurate water clocks incorporated complex segmental and epicyclic gearing, water wheel s, and programmability, advances which eventually made their way to Europe. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks, incorporating gears, escapement mechanisms, and water wheels, passing their ideas on to Korea and Japan [ November 2011 ]. Some water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. These early water clocks were calibrated with a sundial. While never reaching a level of accuracy comparable to today&apos;s standards of timekeeping, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by more accurate pendulum clock s in 17th century Europe. [ Regional development ] [ Persia ] Ancient Persian clock Reconstruction of the scene of a water clock manager(MirAab), Iran According to Callisthenes, the Persia ns were using water clocks in 328 BC to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from qanat s to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Zeebad, dates back to 500BC. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the Nowruz, Chelah, or Yaldā - the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar. { Confrence of Qanat in Iran - water clock in Persia 1383, in Persian } in the History of timekeeping devices in Persia, in every part of the Iranian desert you can find a room called fenjaan a famous device for permanent timekeeping or a water clock.Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today&apos;s standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. [ February 2012 ] Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat&apos;s shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock(MirAab), and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights. { water clock in persia ] آAmordad } The fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers&apos; calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in used until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks. [ Egypt ] The oldest water clock of which there is physical evidence dates to c. 1417-1379 BC, during the reign of Amenhotep III where it was used in the Temple of Amen-Re at Karnak. [ Cotterell Brian Kamminga Johan 1990 Mechanics of pre-industrial technology: An introduction to the mechanics of ancient and traditional material culture Cambridge University Press 0-521-42871-8 18520966 ] {, pp. 59–61 } The oldest documentation of the water clock is the tomb inscription of the 16th century BC Egyptian court official Amenemhet, which identifies him as its inventor.

The Egyptians 1997 The University of Chicago Press Chicago 0-226-15555-2 118 Bureaucrats ] These simple water clocks, which were of the outflow type, were stone vessels with sloping sides that allowed water to drip at a nearly constant rate from a small hole near the bottom. There were twelve separate columns with consistently spaced markings on the inside to measure the passage of &quot; hours &quot; as the water level reached them. The columns were for each of the twelve month s to allow for the variations of the seasonal hours. These clocks were used by priests to determine the time at night so that the temple rites and sacrifices could be performed at the correct hour. [ Cotterell Kamminga 1990 59 ] These clocks may have been used in daylight as well.

Use of the water clock as an aid to astronomical calculations dates back to the Old Babylonian period (c. 2000 BC–c. 1600 BC). [ Pingree David David Pingree Stephanie Dalley The Legacy of Mesopotamia 1998 Oxford University Press Oxford 0-19-814946-8 125–126 Legacies in Astronomy and Celestial Omens ] While there are no surviving water clocks from the Mesopotamian region, most evidence of their existence comes from writings on clay tablet s. Two collections of tablets, for example, are the Enuma-Anu-Enlil (1600–1200 BC) and the MUL.APIN (7th century BC). [ Evans James The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy 1998 Oxford University Press Oxford 0-19-509539-1 15 ] In these tablets, water clocks are used in reference to payment of the night and day watches (guards). These clocks were unique, as they did not have an indicator such as hands (as are typically used today) or grooved notches (as were used in Egypt). Instead, these clocks measured time &quot; by the weight of water flowing from &quot; it. [ Neugebauer 1947 39–40 ] The volume was measured in capacity units called qa. The weight, mana (the Greek unit for about one pound), is the weight of water in a water clock. It is important to note that during Babylonian times, time was measured with temporal hours. So, as seasons changed, so did the length of a day. &quot; To define the length of a &apos;night watch&apos; at the summer solstice, one had to pour two mana of water into a cylindrical clepsydra; its emptying indicated the end of the watch. One-sixth of a mana had to be added each succeeding half-month. At equinox, three mana had to be emptied in order to correspond to one watch, and four mana were emptied for each watch of the winter solstitial night. &quot; [ India ] N. Kameswara Rao suggests that pots excavated from Mohenjodaro might have been used as water clocks; they are tapered at the bottom, have a hole on the side, and are similar to the utensil used to perform abhishekam (pour holy water) on shivalingam. [ N. Kameswara Rao 2005 December Aspects of prehistoric astronomy in India Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India 33 4 499–511 http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~basi/05December/3305499-511.pdf 2007-05-11 It appears that two artifacts from Mohenjadaro and Harappa might correspond to these two instruments. Joshi and Parpola (1987) lists a few pots tapered at the bottom and having a hole on the side from the excavations at Mohenjadaro (Figure 3). A pot with a small hole to drain the water is very similar to clepsydras described by Ohashi to measure the time (similar to the utensil used over the lingum in Shiva temple for abhishekam). harv ] N.

Pande, ed.), pp.,. physics/0301078 ] [ March 2009 ] suggest that the use of the water clock in ancient India is mentioned in the Atharvaveda from the 2nd millennium BC. Ghati or Kapala (clepsydra or water clock) is referred to in Jyotisha Vedanga, where the amount of water that measures a nadika (24 minutes) is mentioned. A more developed form of the clepsydra is described in chapter xiii, 23 of the Suryasiddhanta. { &quot; A copper vessel (in the shape of the lower half of the water jar) which has a small hole in its bottom and being placed upon clean water in a basin sinks exactly 60 times in a day and at night. &quot; - chapter xiii, 23 of the Suryasiddhanta. } At Nalanda, a Buddhist university, four hours a day and four hours at night were measured by a water clock, which consisted of a copper bowl holding two large floats in a larger bowl filled with water. The bowl was filled with water from a small hole at its bottom; it sank when completely filled and was marked by the beating of a drum at daytime. The amount of water added varied with the seasons and this clock was operated by the students of the university. [ Scharfe Hartmut Education in Ancient India 2002 Brill Academic Publishers Leiden 90-04-12556-6 171 ] The description of a water clock in astrologer Varahimira&apos;s Pancasiddhantika (505) adds further detail to the account given in the Suryasiddhanta. The description given by mathematician Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta matches with that given in the Suryasiddhanta. Astronomer Lallacharya describes this instrument in detail. { &quot; A copper vessel weighing 10 palas, 6 angulas in height and twice as much in breadth at the mouth--this vessel of the capacity of 60 palas of water and hemispherical in form is called a ghati. &quot; This copper vessel, which was bored with a needle and made of 3 1/8 masas of gold and 4 angulas long, gets filled in one nadika. &quot; } In practice, the dimensions were determined by experiment.

The oldest reference dates the use of the water-clock in China to the 6th century BC. [ Needham 2000 479 ] From about 200 BC onwards, the outflow clepsydra was replaced almost everywhere in China by the inflow type with an indicator-rod borne on a float. Huan Tan (40 BC – AD 30), a Secretary at the Court in charge of clepsydrae, wrote that he had to compare clepsydrae with sundials because of how temperature and humidity affected their accuracy, demonstrating that the effects of evaporation, as well as of temperature on the speed at which water flows, were known at this time. [ Needham 1995 321–322 ] In 976, Zhang Sixun addressed the problem of the water in clepsydrae freezing in cold weather by using liquid mercury instead. [ Needham 2000 469–471 ] Again, instead of using water, the early Ming Dynasty engineer Zhan Xiyuan (c. 1360-1380) created a sand-driven wheel clock, improved upon by Zhou Shuxue (c. 1530-1558). { Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. Pages 510 –511. } The use of clepsydrae to drive mechanisms illustrating astronomical phenomena began with Zhang Heng (78-139) in 117, who also employed a waterwheel. [ Needham 2000 pps. 30, 532 ] Zhang Heng was the first in China to add an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel, which solved the problem of the falling pressure head in the reservoir tank. Zhang&apos;s ingenuity led to the creation by Yi Xing (683 –727) and Liang Lingzan in 725 of a clock driven by a waterwheel linkwork escapement mechanism. [ Needham 2000 pps. 471, 490, 532 ] The same mechanism would be used by Su Song (1020–1101) in 1088 to power his astronomical clock tower, as well as a chain drive. [ Needham 2000 462 ] Su Song&apos;s clock tower, over [ 30 ft m ] tall, possessed a bronze power-driven armillary sphere for observations, an automatically rotating celestial globe, and five front panels with doors that permitted the viewing of changing manikin s which rang bells or gongs, and held tablets indicating the hour or other special times of the day. Today, in Beijing &apos;s Drum Tower an outflow clepsydra is operational and displayed for tourists. It is connected to automata so that every quarter-hour a small brass statue of a man claps his cymbals. { Picture of water clock in Beijing } [ Greco-Roman world ] An early 19th-century illustration This engraving is taken from &quot; Rees&apos;s Clocks, Watches, and Chronometers 1819-20. The design of the illustration was modified from Claude Perrault&apos;s illustrations in his 1684 translation of Vitruvius&apos;s Les Dix Livres d&apos;Architecture (1st century BC), of which he describes Ctesibius&apos;s clepsydra in great length. of Ctesibius&apos;s clepsydra from the 3rd century BC. The hour indicator ascends as water flows in. Also, a series of gears rotate a cylinder to correspond to the temporal hours. In Greece, a water clock was known as a clepsydra (water thief). The Greeks considerably advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest feedback control system. { Goodenow, J., Orr, R., &amp; Ross, D. &quot; Mathematical Models of Water Clocks. &quot; Rochester Institute of Technology } Ctesibius invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer. { John G. Landels: &quot; Water-Clocks and Time Measurement in Classical Antiquity &quot;, &quot; Endeavour &quot;, Vol. 3, No. 1 (1979), pp. 32-37 (35) } The Roman engineer Vitruvius described early alarm clocks, working with gongs or trumpets. A commonly used water clock was the simple outflow clepsydra. This small earthenware vessel had a hole in its side near the base. In both Greek and Roman times, this type of clepsydra was used in courts for allocating periods of time to speakers. In important cases, when a person&apos;s life was at stake for example, it was filled. But, for more minor cases, it was only partially filled. If proceedings were interrupted for any reason, such as to examine documents, the hole in the clepsydra was stopped with wax until the speaker was able to resume his pleading. [ Hill 1981 6 ] In the 4th century BC, the clepsydra is known to have been used as a stop-watch for imposing a time limit on clients&apos; visits in Athenian brothels. { John G. Landels: &quot; Water-Clocks and Time Measurement in Classical Antiquity &quot;, &quot; Endeavour &quot;, Vol. 3, No. 1 (1979), pp. 32-37 (33) } Slightly later, in the early 3rd century BC, the Hellenistic physician Herophilos employed a portable clepsydra on his house visits in Alexandria for measuring his patients&apos; pulse-beats. By comparing the rate by age group with empirically obtained data sets, he was able to determine the intensity of the disorder. Between 270 BC and 500 AD, Hellenistic ( Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes ) and Roman horologists and astronomer s were developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang bell s and gong s, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe. The 3rd century BC engineer Philo of Byzantium referred in his works to water clocks already fitted with an escapement mechanism, the earliest known of its kind. [ Lewis 2000 356f. ] The biggest achievement of the invention of clepsydrae during this time, however, was by Ctesibius with his incorporation of gears and a dial indicator to automatically show the time as the lengths of the days changed throughout the year, because of the temporal timekeeping used during his day. Also, a Greek astronomer, Andronicus of Cyrrhus, supervised the construction of his Horologion, known today as the Tower of the Winds, in the Athens marketplace (or agora ) in the first half of the 1st century BC. This octagon al clocktower showed scholars and shoppers both sundial s and mechanical hour indicators. It featured a 24- hour mechanized clepsydra and indicators for the eight winds from which the tower got its name, and it displayed the season s of the year and astrological dates and periods. [ Islamic and Arabic world ] { Al-Jazari &apos;s } { elephant water clock (1206). } [ ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari al-Jazari Translated and annotated by Donald Routledge Hill The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices 1974 D. Reidel Dordrecht 969-8016-25-2 ] In the medieval Islamic world (632-1280), the use of water clocks has its roots from Archimedes during the rise of Alexandria in Egypt and continues on through Byzantium. The water clocks by Al-Jazari, however, are credited for going &quot; well beyond anything &quot; that had preceded them. In al-Jazari&apos;s 1206 treatise, he describes one of his water clocks, the elephant clock. The clock recorded the passage of temporal hours, which meant that the rate of flow had to be changed daily to match the uneven length of days throughout the year. To accomplish this, the clock had two tanks, the top tank was connected to the time indicating mechanisms and the bottom was connected to the flow control regulator. Basically, at daybreak the tap was opened and water flowed from the top tank to the bottom tank via a float regulator that maintained a constant pressure in the receiving tank. [ al-Hassan Hill 1986 57–59 ] { castle clock of } { Al-Jazari, 12th century. } The most sophisticated water-powered astronomical clock was Al-Jazari &apos;s castle clock, considered by some to be an early example of a programmable analog computer, in 1206. [ Ancient Discoveries, Episode 11: Ancient Robots History Channel http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DrxjbaQl0ad8 2008-09-06 ] [ April 2012 H3llBot ] It was a complex device that was about [ 11 ft m ] high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits, and a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which traveled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour. { Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 184. } { University of Texas Press, ISBN 0-292-78149-0. } { Routledge Hill, Donald, &quot; Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East &quot;, Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64–69. ( } { cf. } { Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering ) } It was possible to re-program the length of day and night in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year, and it also featured five musician automata who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel. Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float, a float chamber and flow regulator, plate and valve trough, two pulleys, crescent disc displaying the zodiac, and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases. { Google book search } The first water clocks to employ complex segmental and epicyclic gearing was invented earlier by the Arab engineer Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia c. 1000. His water clocks were driven by water wheel s, as was also the case for several Chinese water clocks in the 11th century. { Ahmad Y Hassan, Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering, History of Science and Technology in Islam } Comparable water clocks were built in Damascus and Fez. The latter ( Dar al-Magana ) remains until today and its mechanism has been reconstructed. The first European clock to employ these complex gears was the astronomical clock created by Giovanni de Dondi in c. 1365. Like the Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed an escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. The escapement mechanism was in the form of a constant-head system, while heavy floats were used as weights. { Hassan, Ahmad Y, Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering, History of Science and Technology in Islam } [ Korea ] An incomplete scaled-down model of Jang Yeong-sil&apos;s self-striking water clock. In 1434 during the Choson (or Joseon ) Dynasty, Chang Yongsil (or Jang Young Sil ), Palace Guard and later Chief Court Engineer, constructed the Jagyeongnu (self-striking water clock or striking clepsydra) for King Sejong. What made the Jagyeongnu self-striking (or automatic) was the use of jack-work mechanisms, by which three wooden figures (jacks) struck objects to signal the time. This innovation no longer required the reliance of human workers, known as &quot; rooster men &quot;, to constantly replenish it. By 554, the water clock spread from Korea to Japan. Water clocks were used and improved upon throughout Asia well into the 15th century. [ Modern water clock designs ] Bernard Gitton&apos;s Time-Flow clock Only a few modern water clocks exist today. In 1979, French scientist Bernard Gitton began creating his Time-Flow Clocks, which are a modern-day approach to the historical version. His unique glass tube designs can be found in over 30 locations throughout the world, including one at Europa-Center &apos;s The Clock of Flowing Time in Berlin, one at The Children&apos;s Museum of Indianapolis in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Shopping Iguatemi in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Gitton&apos;s design relies on gravity powering multiple siphon s; for example, after the water level in the minute or hour display tubes is reached, an overflow tube starts to act as a siphon and thus empties the display tube. Actual time keeping is done by a calibrated pendulum powered by a water stream piped from the clock&apos;s reservoir. The pendulum has a carefully constructed container attached to it; this measures the water that is then poured into the display system. There are other modern designs of water clocks, including the Royal Gorge water clock in Colorado, the Woodgrove Mall in Nanaimo, British Columbia, in the Abbotsford Airport in Abbotsford, British Columbia, and the Hornsby Water Clock in Sydney, Australia.
