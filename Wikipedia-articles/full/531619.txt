[ July 2009 ] [ July 2009 ] [ 3D Movie Maker Microsoft Kids Big Blue Dot ( Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker) 1995 Windows 3D computer graphics software English, Japanese Discontinued Proprietary ] 3D Movie Maker (often abbreviated as 3DMM) is a program created by Microsoft &apos;s &quot; Microsoft Kids &quot; subsidiary in 1995. Using this program, directors are able to place 3D characters into pre-made environments, add actions, sound effects, music, text, speech, and special effects then show these movies off to friends, family, and the world. These are saved in the 3D Movie formats: &quot;.3mm &quot; and &quot;.vmm &quot;. The program features two helper characters to guide users through the various features of the program. The character McZee provides help throughout the studio while his assistant Melanie provides various tutorials. In Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker, the user is guided by Stick Stickly. 3D Movie Maker is built on the BRender, a 3D graphics engine created by Argonaut Software. The models and prerendered backgrounds were created by Illumin8 Digital Pictures, a now defunct graphics studio, using Softimage modeling software. The cinematic introduction and help sequences were created by Productions Jarnigoine, a now inactive production company directed by Jean-Jacques Tremblay. [ Variants ] A Japanese expansion pack for 3DMM was released with characters from the popular children&apos;s manga and anime series Doraemon. It consists of 11 new scenes, 5 new characters, and 96 new voices. Demo versions: these only feature the studio, do not allow the opening or saving of movies, and only feature two actors and one prop. They are Bongo, Nakita and a red car for 3D Movie Maker and Ren, Stimpy and a spaceship for Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker. Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker is software separate from, but based on, 3D Movie Maker. This spin-off includes 12 unique actors and 11 unique scenes from Rocko&apos;s Modern Life, Ren &amp; Stimpy and AAAHH!!! Real Monsters. An unofficial expansion pack was later created, allowing Nickelodeon actors, props, scenes, music and sounds to be used in the original 3D Movie Maker.

A video camera works by recording images (frames) in quick succession. 3D Movie Maker stores the positions of the characters and objects for each frame. It moves at about 6 to 8 frames per second, which makes the movies choppier than expected. The finished movie, however, can only be viewed inside 3D Movie Maker using the virtual auditorium or the studio, unless converted to a video file format with a third-party utility. Movies are recorded at the 544 x 306 pixels resolution, in the 16:9 image aspect ratio. [ Theatre building ] The theatre building in 3D Movie Maker consists of several rooms: The ticket booth, where McZee is inside, dancing to music before getting hit by his own paper plane. Afterwards, he asks the user if they would like to see a movie or create their own. The lobby, where McZee strolls around. There is also a concession stand. The theatre, for watching movies. The backstage, a small room which links to the ideas, projects and studio rooms. The ideas room, where one can consult the talent book or use the &quot; splot machine &quot;. The projects room, where Melanie will teach the user how to create a 3D logo or movie techniques. The studio, featuring the toolbox used to create movies. In Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker, only the theatre, &quot; splot machine &quot; and toolbox are available. They are called the &quot; Big chair &quot;, &quot; Choos-O-meter &quot;, and &quot; Movie-making-machine &quot;, respectively, and are all located inside a loft.
