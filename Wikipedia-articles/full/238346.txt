Tarring and feathering is a physical punishment, used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge. It was used in feudal Europe and its colonies in the early modern period, as well as the early American frontier, mostly as a type of mob vengeance (compare Lynch law ). [ Description ] In a typical tar-and-feathers attack, the mob&apos;s victim was stripped to his waist. Hot tar was either poured or painted onto the person while he was immobilized. Then the victim either had feathers thrown on him or was rolled around on a pile of feathers so they stuck to the tar. Often the victim was then paraded around town on a cart or wooden rail. The aim was to inflict enough pain and humiliation on a person to make him either reform his behavior or leave town. The practice was never an official punishment in the United States, but rather a form of vigilante justice. A more brutal derivation, called pitchcapping, was used by British forces against Irish rebels during the period of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Sometimes only the head was shaven, tarred and feathered; at other times, a match was held to the feathers to light them and the tar on fire to inflict pain. [ Materials ] Tarring and feathering was often presented in literature humorously as a punishment inflicting public humiliation and discomfort, but not serious injury. This is hard to understand if the tar used were the material now most commonly referred to as &quot; tar &quot;, which has a high melting point and would cause serious burns to the skin. However, the &quot; tar &quot; used then was pine tar, a completely different substance, with a much lower melting point. Some varieties were liquid at room temperature. [ Petroleum Tar ] Modern tar, also called bitumen or asphalt, is produced from either petroleum or coal. (Americans, at least colloquially, call all these materials tar, while the British seem to reserve ‘tar’ for coal or pine tar, while the petroleum derivative is called bitumen.) Typically used for tarring roads and roofs, the material must be semi-solid in normal weather under the hot sun, so tar, which is a mixture of a large number of different complex hydrocarbons and doesn’t have a single melting point, must have a high “softening point,” the temperature at which the material becomes too soft to do its job. (It becomes more and more liquid as temperature rises above that.) For example, one modern brand of roofing asphalt has a softening point of 220°F (104°C), but is applied at 380°F (193°C). [ http://www.owenscorning.com/trumbull/resources/downloads/asphalt_softening_points.pdf Owens-Corning Trumbull Technical Report: Effects on asphalt softening points of various time and temperature operating conditions PDF 2012-03-07 ] At the latter temperature it is a liquid that can be sloshed around. This kind of petroleum-based hot tar would burn any skin it came into contact with. Paving materials, both coal and petroleum-based, are mixed at somewhat lower temperatures (221°F (105°C) for coal tar, 302-357°F (150-180°C) for bitumen), [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3D8MiQWwvH5HgC Cliff Nicholls, ’’Asphalt Surfacings’’pp. 315, 377 Books.google.com 2012-03-07 ] but when liquid would still be hot enough to cause severe injuries. [ Pine Tar ] However, historically, the most common tar was another material altogether, which had different properties and completely different uses. This was pine tar. It was used for waterproofing wooden ships and for weatherproofing rope. Melville, in Moby Dick, mentions “putting your hand in the tar-pot” as one of the undignified things sailors were expected to do. It was not a punishment, just a duty, like sweeping down the deck. [ http://books.google.com/books?id%3DcyokAAAAMAAJ%26amp%3Bq%3Dtar%2Bpot#v%3Dsnippet%26amp%3Bq%3Dtar%20pot%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse Moby Dick or The White Whale; by Herman Melville, 1892, p.10 Books.google.com 2012-03-07 ] Clearly this would not have been possible with asphalt. But rope, unlike roads, must remain flexible, so the tar used had to be softer (closer to liquid) at lower temperatures. The melting point of pine tar is 130-140°F (55-60°C). [ http://www.sfm.state.or.us/CR2K_SubDB/MSDS/002580.TXT Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety Pine Tar MSDS ] Pine tar’s boiling point is listed at 637°F (337C). Since each of these materials – bitumen, coal tar, pine tar, pitch – is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, its viscosity/temperature characteristics can vary greatly, depending on how it was made and treated, though pitch is by definition darker and thicker than tar. Somewhat like molasses, which comes in different grades, some pine tars were like golden syrup at room temperature, others much blacker and thicker. The latter had to be heated to a higher temperature to use, and so was called “hot tar.” Therefore it is difficult to know, in a particular instance, just what the material might have been that someone was tarred and feathered with. Unless the tar was boiling, it was not necessarily a brutal procedure. Often it seems to have been more a matter of humiliation than torture. [ History ] The earliest mention of the punishment appears in orders that Richard I of England, issued to his navy on starting for the Holy Land in 1189. &quot; Concerning the lawes and ordinances appointed by King Richard for his navie the forme thereof was this... item, a thiefe or felon that hath stolen, being lawfully convicted, shal have his head shorne, and boyling pitch poured upon his head, and feathers or downe strawed upon the same whereby he may be knowen, and so at the first landing-place they shall come to, there to be cast up &quot; (transcript of original statute in Hakluyt &apos;s Voyages, ii. 21). A later instance of this penalty appears in Notes and Queries (series 4, vol. v), which quotes James Howell, writing in Madrid in 1623, of the &quot; boisterous Bishop of Halberstadt, &quot; who, &quot; having taken a place where there were two monasteries of nuns and friars, he caused divers feather beds to be ripped, and all the feathers thrown into a great hall, whither the nuns and friars were thrust naked with their bodies oiled and pitched and to tumble among these feathers, which makes them here (Madrid) presage him an ill-death. &quot; In 1696 a London bailiff, who attempted to serve process on a debtor who had taken refuge within the precincts of the Savoy, was tarred and feathered and taken in a wheelbarrow to the Strand, where he was tied to a maypole that stood by what is now Somerset House, as an improvised pillory. { propaganda print that depicts the tarring and feathering of } { Boston Commissioner of Customs } { John Malcolm. This was the second time Malcolm had been tarred and feathered. } The first recorded incident in America occurred in 1766: Captain William Smith was tarred, feathered, and dumped into the harbor of Norfolk, Virginia, by a mob that included the town&apos;s Mayor. A vessel picked him out of the water just as his strength was giving out. He survived, and was later quoted as saying that &quot;...[they] dawbed my body and face all over with tar and afterwards threw feathers on me. &quot; As with most other tar-and-feathers victims in the following decade, Smith was suspected of informing on smugglers to the British Customs service. The practice appeared in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1767, when mobs attacked low-level employees of the Customs service with tar and feathers. In October 1769, a mob in Boston attacked a Customs service sailor the same way, and a few similar attacks followed through 1774 (the tarring and feathering of customs worker John Malcolm received particular attention in 1774). Such acts associated the punishment with the Patriot side of the American Revolution. The exception was when, in March 1775, a British regiment inflicted the same treatment on Thomas Ditson, a Billerica, Massachusetts man who attempted to buy a musket from one of the regiment&apos;s soldiers. There is no known case of a person dying from being tarred and feathered in this period. During the Whiskey Rebellion, local farmers inflicted the punishment on Federal tax agents. During the night of March 24, 1832, Joseph Smith, Jr. —leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints —was dragged from his home by a group of men who stripped and beat him before tarring and feathering him. His wife and his infant child, who was knocked from his bed by the attackers, were forced from the home and threatened (the infant died several days later from exposure). Smith was left for dead, but limped back to the home of friends. They spent much of the night scraping the tar from his body, leaving his skin raw and bloody. The following day, Smith spoke at a Church devotional meeting and was reported to have been covered with raw wounds and still weak from the attack. { See } { Life of Joseph Smith, Jr. from 1831 to 1834#Life in Kirtland, Ohio } In 1851 a Know-Nothing mob in Ellsworth, Maine, USA, tarred and feathered a Swiss-born Jesuit priest, Father John Bapst, in the midst of a local controversy over religious education in grammar schools. Bapst fled Ellsworth to settle in nearby Bangor, Maine, where there was a large Irish-Catholic community, and a local high school there is named for him. [ 02258a John Bapst Thomas Campbell December 17, 2008 ] In 1917, during an incident known as the Tulsa Outrage, a group of black-robed Knights of Liberty tarred and feathered seventeen members of the IWW in Oklahoma. [ Chapman Lee Roy http://thislandpress.com/09/01/2011/tate-brady-battle-greenwood/ The Nightmare of Dreamland This Land September 2011 September 1, 2011 ] In the 1920s, vigilantes opposed to IWW organizers at California&apos;s harbor of San Pedro, kidnapped at least one organizer, subjected him to tarring and feathering, and left him in a remote location. This was a relatively rare form of mob punishment for Republican African Americans in the post-bellum U.S. South, as its goal is typically pain and humiliation rather than death (as in the more common lynching and burning alive). { Harris, William J. &quot; Etiquette, Lynching, and Racial Boundaries in Southern History: A Mississippi Example. &quot; } { The American Historical Review. Vol. 100, No. 2 (Apr., 1995), pp. 387–410 } There were several examples of tarring and feathering of African Americans in the lead-up to World War I in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Following the Liberation of France in World War II there were instances of alleged German collaborators being tarred and feathered [ January 2008 ] by street mobs. Most of the victims of this practice were women accused of a Collaboration horizontale, or a sexual relationship with German soldiers. Similar tactics were also used by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the early years of The Troubles. Many of the victims were women accused of sexual relationships with policemen or British soldiers.

Edgar Allan Poe &apos;s humorous short story, &quot; The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, &quot; features the staff of an insane asylum being tarred and feathered. It is mentioned in the chorus of the song &quot; To Kingdom Come &quot;, from The Band &apos;s album Music from Big Pink. Jimmy Carter &apos;s 2003 novel Hornet&apos;s Nest describes the tarring and feathering of a Tory by members of the Sons of Liberty. Tarring and feathering is a common punishment for low-lives and unfortunate citizens (and often the Dalton brothers as well) in the French-Belgian comic Lucky Luke, mostly for comedy purposes. The avant-garde electronic music artist Fad Gadget often performed on stage while tarred and feathered. He was photographed in tar and feathers for the cover of his album Gag. In the TV show Deadwood, season 2, episode 5 ( &quot; Complications &quot; ), Samuel Fields, the &quot; Nigger General &quot;, is tarred at scalding temperature on the shoulder by a lynch mob leader, before the procedure is interrupted by sheriff Seth Bullock. The tar is then painstakingly but painfully stripped off his shoulder by Calamity Jane. The AMC TV series Hell on Wheels depicts a character, The Swede, getting tarred and feathered before getting run out of town. In the film Little Big Man, Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman) and his con-artist employer, Merriweather (Martin Balsam), were tarred and feathered for having sold &quot; miracle elixirs &quot; that made several townsfolk seriously ill. [ Metaphorical uses ] The image of the tarred-and-feathered outlaw remains a metaphor for public humiliation many years after the practice became uncommon. To tar and feather someone can mean to punish or severely criticize that person. [ http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tar%20and%20feather Tar and Feather.
