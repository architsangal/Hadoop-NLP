On May 14, 1973 Carl Isaacs, his half brother Wayne Coleman, and fellow prisoner George Dungee escaped from the Maryland State Prison. They were later joined by Carl&apos;s younger brother, 15-year-old Billy Isaacs. While en route to Florida the men came upon the Alday farm in Donalsonville. They stopped at a mobile home owned by Jerry Alday and his wife Mary, to look for gas as there was a gas pump on the property. Alday and his father Ned Alday arrived as the trailer was being ransacked and were ordered inside, and then shot to death in separate bedrooms. Jerry&apos;s brother Jimmy Alday arrived at the trailer on a tractor and he too was led inside and forced to lay on a couch, then shot. Later, Jerry&apos;s 25-year-old wife Mary Alday arrived at the trailer as the men attempted to hide the tractor. She was restrained, while Jerry&apos;s brother Chester Alday and uncle Aubrey Alday arrived in a pickup truck. The criminals accosted the pair still in their truck and forced them inside the trailer where they were also shot to death. Mary Alday was raped on her kitchen table before being taken out to a wooded area miles away where she was raped again and then finally murdered. Billy Isaacs cooperated with prosecutors and received a twenty year sentence for armed robbery. Carl Isaacs, Coleman and Dungee were tried by jury in Seminole County in 1973, convicted and sentenced to death. All three convictions and sentences were overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in 1985, on the grounds that the pool of local jurors had been tainted by excess pretrial publicity. All three defendants were re-tried in 1988 and were again convicted; however, only Carl Isaacs was sentenced to death, Coleman and Dungee receiving life sentences. Carl Isaacs was executed on May 6, 2003 at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson, by lethal injection. { http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/isaacs852.htm } At the time of his execution, aged 49, he was the longest-serving death row inmate anywhere in the USA, having spent 30 years of death row prior to execution. Billy Isaacs was released from prison in 1993. Dungee and Coleman remain incarcerated as of 2012. Janice Daugharty published a fictionalized account of the murders as Going to Jackson (2010, ). The crimes were also portrayed in the film Murder One. [ Religion ] By the 1900s, the need for churches arose. The first church was erected in Donalsonville in 1850, which was the Friendship United Methodist Church. In the beginning the Methodist Church served as a meeting place for all Protestant denominations. Later, the First Presbyterian Church of Donalsonville was established in January 1898 with 25 members. On August 4, 1902, 18 people helped to create the First Baptist Church of Donalsonville. The Church of The Nazarene, which was first called “The Holiness Church,” was established in October 1902. The meetings of the Church of the Nazarene were actually held in a member’s house, until 1903 when a building was erected. The first black church in Donalsonville was created in 1895, founding Live Oak African Methodist Episcopal Church. The people of Donalsonville saw the need to create churches to worship and with this vision came a number of churches, eventually totaling thirteen. (City-Data.com) [ References ] Seminole County.
