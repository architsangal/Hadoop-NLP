[ the color ] [ Vermilion (Cinnabar) E34234 white 227 66 52 0 71 77 11 5 77 89 ] Vermilion is an opaque orangish red pigment, similar to scarlet, but more orange and less red. The first recorded use of vermilion as a color name in English was in 1289. { Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 206; Color Sample of Vermilion: Page 27 Plate 2 Color Sample L11 } As a naturally occurring mineral pigment, it is known as cinnabar, and has been in use around the world for many thousand years. { Gettens, R. J., Feller, R. L. &amp; Chase, W. T., Artists&apos; Pigments: A Handbook of their History and Characteristics, New York: Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 159 } The first recorded use of cinnabar as a color name (the color name &quot; cinnabar &quot; is a synonym for vermilion) in English was in 1382. { Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 193; Color Sample of Cinnabar (It is noted on page 193 that Cinnabar is the same color as Vermilion): Page 27 Plate 2 Color Sample L11 } Most naturally produced vermilion comes from cinnabar mined in China, and vermilion is nowadays commonly called &apos;China red&apos;. [ Cox Robert E. The elixir of immortality: A modern-day alchemist&apos;s discovery of the philosopher&apos;s stone 2009 Inner Traditions Rochester 978-1-59477-303-7 22–23 ] The name &apos;vermilion&apos; is derived from the French vermeil (indicating any red dye), from Latin vermiculum, the ancient insect dye from Kermes vermilio. { Eastaugh, p. 211 } Words for red hues in Portuguese (vermelho) and Catalan (vermell) arose similarly. &apos;Cinnabar&apos; and &apos;vermilion&apos; were used interchangeably to describe either the natural or manufactured pigment until the 17th century when vermilion became the more common name. By the late 18th century &apos;cinnabar&apos; applied to the unground natural mineral only. The chemical structure of the pigment is HgS mercuric sulfide; like most mercury compounds it is considered toxic. Vermilion is now produced by reacting mercury with molten sulfur. Mercuric sulfides offer a range of warm hues – from bright orange-red to a duller bluish-red. Differences in hue arise via the size of the ground particles of pigment. Larger crystals produce duller and less-orange hue. It is now theorized that coarser, duller &quot; Chinese &quot; forms of vermilion will prove to be more permanent than the more orange &quot; French &quot; variety. [ April 2012 ] It is also theorized that purification of any such pigment benefits its general stability. [ April 2012 ] For safety reasons the use of vermilion has recently been replaced (in some applications) with cadmium red, yielding a similar range of hues, although cadmium carries severe hazards of its own. [ History ] { Sindoor (Vermilion) in the Hindu pilgrimage town of } { Pushkar, Rajasthan } Vermilion Box in Shimla Museum, Himachal Pradesh Before the invention of writing, cinnabar pigments were used by humans. This is evidenced across the Old World, east (China, India (as Sindoor )) to west (Spain). As minium it was ancient Rome&apos;s most valued pigment [ December 2010 ]. Grateful Romans led victorious generals in procession to Capitolinus Temple, the victors&apos; faces covered with minium, honoring the vermilion visage of Jupiter upon Capitoline Hill. Pliny the Elder records that it became so expensive that the price became fixed by decree- 70 sesterces per libum { Eastaugh, p. 387 } — ten times more costly than red ochre. From ancient times vermilion was regarded as the color of life (i.e., blood). Cinnabar provided the ubiquitous &quot; China red &quot;, coloring Chinese life from the palatial red lacquer s to the printing-pastes for personal name chops, and a unique red calligraphic ink reserved for Emperors. Chinese Taoists associated vermilion with eternity. By the 8th century CE., the Chinese had recorded a procedure incorporating mercury and sulfur into a synthesized vermilion. By the 12th century the synthetic was introduced into Europe but in the west vermilion remained expensive- comparable to gilding in illuminated manuscript production- until the 14th century when the consistency of the synthetic set a popular standard. Cennino Cennini mentions that vermilion is made by alchemy in a retort. I am leaving out the system for this, because it would be too tedious to set forth in my discussion all the methods and receipts. Because, if you want to take the trouble, you will find plenty of receipts for it, and especially by asking of the friars. But I advise you rather to get some of that which you find at the druggists&apos; for your money, so as not to lose time in the many variations of procedure. And I will teach you how to buy it, and to recognize the good vermilion. Always buy vermilion unbroken, and not pounded or ground. The reason? Because it is generally adulterated, either with red lead or with pounded brick.&apos;&apos; { Cennini, Cennino D&apos; Andrea. Il Libro dell&apos; Arte (The Craftsman&apos;s Handbook). Trans. Daniel V. Thompson, Jr. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1933. } From the 17th century is recorded a modification of Chinese manufacture known as the &apos;Dutch&apos; method. Mercury and melted sulfur were mashed to make black mercury sulfide, then heated in retort, producing vapors condensing as a bright, red mercury sulfide. To remove the sulfur these crystals were treated with a strong alkali, washed and finally ground under water to yield the commercial powder form of pigment. [ Gettens Rutherford J. Stout, George L. Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopedia Courier Dover Publications 1966 171 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DbdQVgKWl3f4C%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bcad%3D0#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 0-486-21597-0 ] Chinese vermilion was considered a superior hue to the European pigment. In 1835 &quot; Chinese vermilion &quot; was described as a cinnabar so pure that it only had to be ground into powder to become a perfect vermilion. Historically European vermilion included adulterants including brick, orpiment, iron oxide, Persian red, iodine scarlet -- and minium (red lead), an inexpensive &amp; bright but fugitive (cf Pigment#impermanence ) lead-oxide pigment. [ Modern day ] In the demanding watercolor applications the hue of natural pigment vermilion is today supplied by a versatile, stable pigment which replaces the mercury of vermilion with cadmium: this contemporary pigment is known as cadmium red. The cadmium pigments offer the same range of warm hues. With addition of selenium or zinc, hues range from lemon-yellow to the dull, deep red known as &quot; cadmium purple &quot;. Natural pigment vermilion remains standard in oil vehicles. [ China red ] &quot; China red &quot; is another name for other versions of the pigment vermilion, which is the traditional red pigment of Chinese art. Chinese name chops are printed with a red cinnabar paste, and vermilion (or cinnabar) is the pigment used in Chinese red lacquer. Cinnabar also has significance in Taoist culture, and was regarded as the color of life and eternity.

Mark Crispin seems to claim Digital&apos;s name for the color was Terracotta, at least in the context of PDP-10 machines running Tops-20.
