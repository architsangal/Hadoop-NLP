Location of Squaw Valley in the United States ] The 1960 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VIII Olympic Winter Games, were a winter multi-sport event held between 18 and 28 February 1960 in Squaw Valley, California, United States. In 1955 at the 50th IOC meeting, the organizing committee made the surprise choice to award Squaw Valley as hosts for the 1960 Winter Games. Squaw Valley was mostly undeveloped, so from 1956 to 1960 all of the venues and infrastructure had to be built or improved at a cost of $80,000,000. The Games featured the first athlete&apos;s village and was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and athletes the ability to walk to nearly all the venues. The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by Walt Disney and televised by CBS. The 1960 Games were the first to have television broadcast rights sold to the highest bidder. It was the first time in 28  years that an Olympic Games had been held in North America. Thirty nations and 665 athletes competed in four sports and 27 events. Women&apos;s speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue, so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning 21 medals, 7 of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova were the only multiple gold medalists. Swedish lumberjack Sixten Jernberg added a gold and silver to the 4 medals he won at the 1956 Winter Games. He would win three more in 1964 to finish his Olympic career with 9 medals, becoming the most decorated Winter Olympian to date. World politics affected the lead-up to the Games with tension between the United States and Soviet Union intensifying, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was forced to debate the participation of China, Taiwan, North Korea and East Germany because of the Cold War. In 1957 the United States government threatened to deny visas to athlete from Communist countries, causing the IOC to threaten to revoke Squaw Valley&apos;s right to host the 1960 Games. Bowing to international pressure, the United States allowed athletes from Communist countries entry for the Games. [ Host city selection ] [ Bids for the 1960 Winter Olympics ] Squaw Valley was an unexpected selection for the 1960 Winter Olympics. Innsbruck, Austria had submitted a compelling bid and was considered the favorite while Squaw Valley was a struggling ski resort with minimal facilities. [ The VIII Winter Olympic Games Squaw Valley Ski Corporation http://www.squaw.com/winter/history_olympics.html 29 July 2011 http://web.archive.org/web/20110716125604/http%3A//www.squaw.com/winter/history_olympics.html 16 July 2011 no ] { Findling &amp; Pelle (2004), p. 338 } The only inhabitant and homeowner in the area was Alexander Cushing, who was inspired to an Olympic bid by a newspaper article mentioning that Reno, Nevada and Anchorage, Alaska had expressed interest in the Games. [ Squaw Valley 1960 International Olympic Committee http://www.olympic.org/squaw-valley-1960-winter-olympics 29 July 2011 ] Cushing, president of the Squaw Valley Development Company, petitioned California Governor Goodwin Knight to support a bid to host the Olympic Games. Knight&apos;s administration agreed and recommended that the California Legislature appropriate US$1,000,000 to the effort. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 19 } Based on the financial support received from the State of California the United State Olympic Committee (USOC) approved the bid on 7 January 1955. Cushing and the USOC received a resolution passed by the United State Congress and signed by President Dwight Eisenhower, calling on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to consider Squaw Valley&apos;s bid for the 1960 Games. Preliminary reports were drafted and submitted to the IOC who was considering bids from Innsbruck, St. Moritz, Switzerland and Chamonix, France. Squaw Valley&apos;s bid was accepted with a caveat by IOC president Avery Brundage who warned the Organizing Committee that unless more funds were secured by April 1956, the bid would be awarded to Innsbruck. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp.19–20 } Another $4,000,000 was committed by the State Legislature, which met Brundage&apos;s requirements and on 4 April 1956 the right to host the 1960 Winter Olympics was officially awarded to Squaw Valley. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 20 } Competitors and officials from European nations were incensed with the selection, they felt that the alpine ski courses were not up to specifications and that the altitude would prove too stressful on the athletes.

Cushing presented the site as a blank canvas of unspoiled environment, where a world-class ski resort could be constructed. The obscurity of the location was underscored at the closing ceremonies of the 1956 Winter Olympics. The mayor of the current host city traditionally passed a flag to the mayor of the next host city signalling the transfer of the Games. Since Squaw Valley was an unincorporated village it had no city government. John Garland, an IOC member from California, was asked to stand in and received the flag from the mayor of Cortina d&apos;Ampezzo. After the Games were awarded to Squaw Valley the California Olympic Commission was formed to take the lead in organizing the Games. { Findling &amp; Pelle (2004), p. 339 } Venues, an Olympic Village, and infrastructure had to be constructed and expanded in a four-year time frame. With the expansion of roads, bridges, water and electrical capacity the resort of Squaw Valley became the city of Squaw Valley. Hotels, restaurants, administration buildings, a Sheriff&apos;s office and a sewage pumping and treatment plant were all constructed to support the influx of visitors for the Games. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 27–28 } Organizers wanted the Olympics to be intimate with nearly all of the venues close to one another and the athletes&apos; village. The Blyth Memorial Ice Arena, three outside skating rinks, a 400-meter speed skating oval, and four dormitories to house athletes had to be constructed. One venue deemed impractical to build was the bobsled run. Organizers felt the lack of possible entrants and the high cost of building the run were sufficient deterrents to leave the bobsled events out of the 1960 Olympic program. [ Everything you need to know about bobsled The Washington Post http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/sport/bobsled/articles/bobsled.htm 29 July 2011 ] Several design innovations and new technologies were used for the 1960 Games. The speed skating, figure skating and ice hockey events were held on artificial ice for the first time in Olympic history. A refrigeration plant capable of heating 4,800 homes had to be built to generate and maintain the ice. The heat generated from the refrigeration plant was used to warm spectators, provide hot water, and melt the snow off of roofs. New timing equipment provided by Longines was installed that used a quartz clock to measure to the hundredths of a second. IBM provided a computer that was capable of tabulating results and printing them in English and French. Blyth arena, site of the opening and closing ceremonies, the figure skating and ice hockey competitions, was built with a [ 22 in cm on ] gap in the roof, which would slide closed as the weather cooled and the cables supporting the roof contracted.

To fund the construction the organizers turned to the federal government for assistance. Squaw Valley was the first Games in the United States to receive federal funding; providing around a quarter of the $80 million required to host the event. The monies were used to build the sports arena and provide military support during the Games. [ Olympic Games: Federal Government Provides Significant Funding and Support Ungar Bernard L.

Governor Knight and his successor Edmund &quot; Pat &quot; Brown remained behind the project, seeing it as a means to showcase the state of California to the world. [ Television ] Television was not new to the Olympic Games, broadcasts of events to international audiences had begun at the 1956 Games. { Toohey and Veal (2008), p. 71 } What was unprecedented was the sale of exclusive rights to broadcast the Games. The Organizing Committee decided to sell the television broadcast rights to CBS for $50,000. [ Are Olympic TV rights worth the price? Spence Jim 20 November 1988 New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/20/sports/views-of-sport-are-olympic-tv-rights-worth-the-price.html 29 July 2011 ] [ Olympics and Television Museum of Broadcast Communications http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode%3Dolympicsand 29 July 2011 http://web.archive.org/web/20110628200608/http%3A//www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode%3Dolympicsand 28 June 2011 no ] Unknown at the time was how lucrative the sale of broadcast rights would become. For example, CBS purchased the rights to broadcast the 1960 Summer Olympics for $550,000. During the Games CBS broadcast 31  hours of television focusing on ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating, alpine skiing and ski jumping. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 73 } The impact of television was felt during the Games; in the men&apos;s slalom event, officials who were unsure if a skier had missed a gate asked CBS if they could review tape of the event. This request gave CBS the idea for what is now known as instant replay. [ Politics ] { Avery Brundage } Athletic competition between the Soviet Union and United States had grown intense during the 1950s. Politically their opposing ideologies and interests in nations such as Germany, China and Korea created a delicate situation as the 1960 Winter Games approached. Of particular interest was the question of whether China would be allowed to participate. { Espy (1979), p. 61 } China last participated at the 1952 Summer Games but had since withdrawn from the IOC due to a dispute over Taiwan&apos;s participation as a separate country. [ China and the Olympic Movement Xiao Li China Internet Information Center http://www.china.org.cn/english/null/116819.htm 4 August 2011 ] The United State supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China. Given the fact that the 1960 Games were to be held in America, there was concern among IOC members that the United States would not allow China, or any other Communist country to participate. In 1957 IOC president Avery Brundage announced that if the United States refused entry to any country recognized by the IOC, then they would revoke Squaw Valley&apos;s invitation to host the Games. { This was coupled with a warning that he would resign from the presidency if restrictions were not lifted } { Espy (1979) pp. 61–62 } Bowing to international pressure, the United States allowed athletes from Communist countries to participate. China continued to demand that Taiwan be expelled from the IOC, demands that were refused until China broke off relations ending any hope that they would participate in 1960. { Espy (1979), pp. 62–63 } Problems similar to the issue with China broke out over North Korea and East Germany. Prior to the Korean War the IOC had recognized the Olympic committee of Korea, which was headquartered in Seoul. North Korea was not recognized as a separate country by the IOC who maintained the existence of one Olympic committee. A unified team compromise was proposed but rejected, which meant only athletes from South Korea participated due to their prior recognition. { Espy (1979), pp. 66–67 } Pressure for full recognition of East Germany continued despite the fact that both East and West Germany had participated as a unified team in 1956. Part of the negotiations for a unified German team was that they be represented by a neutral flag. Initially West German officials refused to agree to this stipulation citing the fact that the West German flag had been used at both the 1956 Winter and Summer Games. Eventually the neutral flag was adopted and a unified German team participated. { Espy (1979), p. 67 } [ Events ] The Games were held from 18 to 28 February. There were 27 events in eight sports contested. The sport of biathlon was added to the program as was speed skating events for women. After a poll was taken indicating that only nine countries would send a bobsled team, the organizers determined that bobsled would be removed from the Olympic program. Despite petitions from the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation to reconsider, the organizers felt they could not justify the costs of constructing a bobsled run for nine competing nations. It would be the only time in Winter Olympic history that the bobsled events were not held. [ Opening ceremonies ] A plaque on an official flagpole commissioned by Walt Disney for the 1960 Games The chairman of the &quot; Pageantry Committee &quot; was Walt Disney, who was responsible for producing both the opening and closing ceremonies. He planned on an opening that would include 5,000 entertainers, the release of 2,000 pigeons, and a military gun salute of eight shots, one for each of the previous Winter Olympic Games. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 53–55 } [ Walt Disney:A Biography Krasniewicz Louise Blitz Michael Greenwood Publishing Group Santa Barbara, USA 2010 132 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DlZ3vTgpHgFoC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA132%26amp%3Bdq%3D1960%2Bwinter%2Bolympics%2Bdisney%26amp%3Bhl%3Den#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D1960%20winter%20olympics%20disney%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 978-0-313-35830-2 17 August 2011 ] The opening ceremonies were held on 18 February 1960 at Blyth Arena in the midst of a blizzard. Heavy snow fell the morning of the 18th and caused traffic problems that delayed the ceremony by an hour. The festivities began with a sustained drum roll as the flags of each participating nation were raised on specially designed flag poles. As the Greek standard bearer led the 30 participating countries in the traditional Parade of Nations the weather broke and the rest of the two-hour ceremony proceeded in sunshine. Vice President Richard Nixon represented the United States government and declared the Games open. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 53 } The Olympic flame was lit by Kenneth Henry, Olympic champion of the 500  meter speed skating race at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. The Olympic oath was taken by Carol Heiss on behalf of all the athletes. As the national delegations exited the stadium fireworks concluded the ceremonies. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 55 } [ Ice hockey ] [ Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics ] The ice hockey tournament took place at Blyth Arena and the Squaw Valley Olympic Skating Rink. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 121 } Controversy over the amateur status of some of the players overshadowed the event. Canadian Olympic officials began to protest the use of &quot; professional amateurs &quot; by Eastern Bloc countries, and especially the Soviet Union. They alleged that the Soviets were giving their elite hockey players phantom jobs in the military that allowed them to play hockey full time, which gave Soviet teams an advantage that they used to dominate Olympic hockey tournaments for nearly 30  years. { Caraccioli (2006), p. 48 } This issue started coming to light during the 1960 Games and would culminate in a Canadian boycott of Olympic hockey tournament at the 1972 Winter Olympics. { Caraccioli (2006), p. xvii } The team from the United States won an improbable gold medal, defeating the favored Canadian and Soviet teams, who took silver and bronze respectively.

Subsequently it was a demonstration sport at the 1928, 1936, and 1948 Winter Olympics, though the competition was only open to members of the military.

Skiers from 6 different nations won medals and Penny Pitou of the United States was the only multiple medal winner when she earned two silvers in the downhill and giant slalom. [ Closing ceremonies ] The Games were brought to a close on 28 February, in Blyth Memorial arena in front of 20,000 people. Flags of the participating nations were followed by the athletes marching as a group with no national distinctions. The flag bearers made a semi-circle around the rostrum and the national anthems of Greece, United States, and Austria were played as their respective flags were raised. { The Greek flag honored Greece as the originators of the Olympic Games, the United States flag represented the host nation and the Austrian flag was raised because } { Innsbruck, Austria had been selected to host the 1964 Winter Games. } IOC president Avery Brundage declared the Games closed at which point the Olympic flame was extinguished. The Games concluded with the release of several thousand balloons. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 59–60 } [ Calendar ] The opening ceremony was held on 18 February, along with the first games of the hockey tournament. From 19 to 28 February, the day of the closing ceremony, at least one event final was held each day. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 54–59 }  OC   Opening ceremony   &amp; ensp;●   Event competitions  1   Event finals†  CC   Closing ceremony February 1960 18 Thu 19 Fri 20 Sat 21 Sun 22 Mon 23 Tue 24 Wed 25 Thu 26 Fri 27 Sat 28 Sun Events Ceremonies OC CC link= Ice hockey Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 124–135 ●   ●   ●   ●   ●   ●   ●   ●   1 1 link= Figure skating Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 137–151 1 1 1 3 link= Speed skating Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 153–159 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 link= Alpine skiing Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 100–102 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 link= Cross-country skiing Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 115–117 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 link= Nordic combined Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 106 1 1 link= Ski jumping Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 105–106 1 1 link= Biathlon Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 120 1 1 Total event finals 2 3 3 3 4 2 2 4 2 2 27 Cumulative Total 2 5 8 11 15 17 19 23 25 27 27 † The numeral indicates the number of event finals for each sport held that day. [ Venues ] The lack of facilities prior to the Olympics gave organizers freedom to tailor the layout of the venues to fit the needs of the athletes. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 33 } Their vision was for an intimate Games in which athletes and spectators could walk between venues. This was accomplished with the exception of the cross-country events, which were held at McKinney Creek a [ 12 mi km on ] drive from Squaw Valley. In prior Winter Olympics the athletes were housed in hotels and billeted with local families. Since no such facilities existed in Squaw Valley the organizers decided to build the first Olympic Village at the Winter Games. Competitors slept in one of four dormitories and ate together in a dining room. The complex was located centrally with access to all the sporting facilities. The peaks surrounding Squaw Valley were used for the alpine skiing events. The ladies&apos; downhill and men&apos;s slalom and giant slalom were on KT-22 mountain, while the ladies&apos; slalom and giant slalom were contested on Little Papoose Peak. Squaw Peak was the site of the men&apos;s downhill competition. Prior to the Games concerns persisted that the courses would not meet international standards. To addresses these concerns a test event was held in 1959 and attending delegates from the International Ski Federation (FIS) left assured that the events would comply with FIS rules and specifications. Bleachers were constructed for officials, coaches and spectators along with broadcast booths for radio and television. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 93 } The ski jump hill was located on Little Papoose Peak directly opposite of Blyth Memorial Arena. Designed by Heini Klopfer, the hill was innovative in that it had 40, 60, and 80  meter jumps. Tall trees on both sides protected athletes from the wind and it was situated so that the sun would be at the jumper&apos;s back during the competition. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 103 } McKinney Creek Stadium was built to host all of the cross-country races, which included the biathlon and a portion of the Nordic combined competition. It consisted of a timing building, two Quonset hut s for competitors and course workers, a scoreboard and bleachers to accommodate 1,200 people. Shooting ranges were interspersed throughout the biathlon cross-country course and were supervised by non-commissioned officer s of the United States military. { Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 109–118 } Blyth Memorial Arena was the centerpiece of the Games. It was host to the opening and closing ceremonies, the figure skating competition, several speed skating events as well as most of the games in the hockey tournament. { The alternate site for ice hockey and speed skating was the Squaw Valley Olympic skating rink, which was an outdoor venue with artificial ice. } All three of the sports were held indoors on artificial ice for the first time in Olympic history. At full capacity the arena accommodated 11,000 people, 8,500 of which were seated. [ Then and if Brown Matthew Nevada Magazine January/February 2010 http://www.nevadamagazine.com/issues/read/then_and_if/ 17 August 2011 ] One end of the stadium could be opened and closed, depending on the event. During the ceremonies it was open to allow for the entrance of the athletes, during the competitions it was closed to accommodate more spectators. A special machine was created to resurface the ice for all three competitions. It could lay a new ice surface on the 400-meter speed skating track in 45  minutes. In addition to resurfacing the ice the machine created the snow dividers that delineated the racing lanes. The roof was designed on a suspension principle using cables rather than vertical supports, this removed any visual impediments for the audience but it weakened the strength of the roof. Given the amount of annual snowfall this was a concern, but designers planned on using heat generated by the refrigeration plant to melt the snow. There were flaws in the design and miscalculations in the load the roof could bear, during a particularly heavy snowfall in 1983 a portion of the roof collapsed and the building was demolished.

South Africa competed at the Winter Games for the first time. (It was also its last for many years, as Apartheid policies prevented further participation until 1994). Athletes from West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) competed together as the United Team of Germany from 1956 to 1964.
