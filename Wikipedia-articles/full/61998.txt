He graduated from Mississippi State University in 1977, receiving a BS degree in accounting. He later enrolled in the University of Mississippi School of Law to become a tax lawyer, but his interest shifted to general civil litigation. He graduated in 1983 with a JD degree specializing in criminal law. [ Marriage and family ] Grisham married Renee Jones on May 8, 1981, and the couple have two children together: Shea and Ty.

It was during this time that an unfortunate incident got him &quot; serious &quot; about college. A fight had broken out among the crew on a Friday, with gunfire from which Grisham ran to the restroom to escape. He did not come out until after the police had &quot; hauled away rednecks &quot;.
