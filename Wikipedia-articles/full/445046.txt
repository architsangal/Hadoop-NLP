Named Katahdin by the Penobscot Indians, the term means &quot; The Greatest Mountain &quot;. Katahdin is the centerpiece of Baxter State Park : a steep, tall mountain formed from underground magma. The flora and fauna on the mountain are typical of those found in northern New England. Katahdin was known to the Native Americans in the region, and was known to Europeans at least since 1689. It has inspired hikes, climbs, journal narratives, paintings, and a piano sonata. [ http://www.answers.com/topic/alan-hovhaness answers.com Alan Hovhaness, Sonata for piano, Op. 40 20 March 2009 ] The area around the peak was protected by Governor Percival Baxter starting in the 1930s. Katahdin is the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, and is located near a stretch known as the Hundred-Mile Wilderness. [ Geography ] Katahdin is located in Baxter State Park, which is in east central Piscataquis County, about 25  miles (40  km) northwest of Millinocket. It is on the drainage divide between the East and West branches of the Penobscot River and is the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. The second highest point in Maine, Sugarloaf Mountain at 1,295 m (4,250  ft) is over one hundred miles to the southwest. There is low lake country to the south and west of Katahdin, and lowlands extending east to the Atlantic and north to the Saint Lawrence River in Canada. It is commonly thought that Katahdin is the first place in the United States mainland to receive sunlight in the morning, but this is incorrect. Other mountains, lower in elevation but further to the east or southeast, depending on the season, see the first sunrise of the day. [ 6820 Katahdin, Maine 2010-08-15 ] { Analysis by Blanton C. Wiggin, published in the January 1972 issue of } { Yankee magazine, determined that the first sunrise in the U.S. occurs at } { Mars Hill in most of the spring and summer, and at } { Cadillac Mountain in most of the fall and winter. } [ Natural history ] Katahdin is part of a laccolith (an intrusion of magma underground) that formed in the Acadian orogeny, when an island arc collided with eastern North America approximately 400 million years ago. On the sides of Katahdin are four glacial cirques carved into the granite by alpine glacier s and in these cirques behind moraine s and esker s are several picturesque ponds.

Bedrock surfaces of igneous rocks which have been buried by glacial sediments and only recently exposed have well preserved striations, as in the vicinity of Ripogenus Dam. Several outcrops of sedimentary rocks along the Patten Road show striations, especially on the north side of the road at Hurricane Deck. A few outcrops near the Pattern Road just north of Horse Mountain are striated as are several outcrops of sedimentary rocks along the road from Trout Brook Farm northward to Second Lake Matagamon. Fauna include black bear, deer and moose as well as black flies and mosquito s in the spring. Among the birds are Bicknell&apos;s Thrush and various songbirds and raptors. The mountain has its own indigenous butterfly related to an Arctic type. The flora include pine, spruce, fir, hemlock, beech, maple, birch, aspen, and diapensia. [ TjWikiKatahdin.jpg 1022px Mount Katahdin ] [ Human history ] { Frederic Edwin Church, 1895 } Katahdin is referred to 60 years after Field’s climb of Agiokochuk ( Mount Washington ) in the writings of John Gyles, a teenage colonist who was captured near Portland, Maine in 1689 by the Abenaki. While in the company of Abenaki hunting parties, he traveled up and down several Maine rivers including both branches of the Penobscot, passing close to “Teddon”. He remarked that it was higher than the White Hills above the Saco River. Among some Native Americans, Katahdin was believed to be the home of the storm god Pamola, and thus an area to be avoided. [ Captivity of John Gyles http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/PageView/24033/0029?id%3Da06846515ef3ef06 Early Canadiana Online 18 May 2008 ] The first recorded climb of &quot; Catahrdin &quot; was by Massachusetts surveyor Charles Turner, Jr. in August 1804. [ A Description of Mount Catardin 1804 C. Turner Massachusetts Historical Society Second Series Vol. viii Boston ] In the 1840s Henry David Thoreau climbed Katahdin, which he spelled &quot; Ktaadn &quot;; his ascent is recorded in a well-known chapter of The Maine Woods. A few years later Theodore Winthrop wrote about his visit in Life in the Open Air. Painters Frederic Edwin Church and Marsden Hartley are well-known artists who created landscapes of Katahdin. On Nov. 30 2011, Christie&apos;s auctioned Church&apos;s 1860 painting Twilight(Katahdin) for $3.1 million. In the 1930s Governor Percival Baxter began to acquire land and finally deeded more than 200,000 acre s (809  km²) to the State of Maine for a park, named Baxter State Park after him. The summit was officially recognized by the US Board on Geographic Names as &quot; Baxter Peak &quot; in 1931. Because &quot; Katahdin &quot; means &quot; Greatest Mountain &quot;, &quot; Mount Katahdin &quot; means &quot; Mount Greatest Mountain &quot;, which local people maintain is incorrect, [ Clark Stephen Katahdin: A Guide to Baxter State Park &amp; Katahdin 2003 Clark Books 0-9741677-6-2 ] however the official name is Mount Katahdin as decided by the US Board on Geographic Names in 1893. The Appalachian Trail on Katahdin&apos;s Hunt Spur [ Recreation opportunities ] As the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail and southern terminus of the International Appalachian Trail, Katahdin is a popular hiking and backpacking destination and the centerpiece of Baxter State Park. Baxter State Park is open year round, though strictly regulated in winter. The overnight camping season is from May  15 to October  15 each year. Capacity limits have been placed on day use parking at the trailheads to minimize the overuse of trails. { Baxter State Park Authority, day use parking } [ Knife Edge ] The most famous hike to the summit goes along Knife Edge, which traverses the ridge between Pamola Peak and Baxter Peak. The mountain has claimed 19  lives since 1963, { Hiking in Baxter State Park: Tips } mostly from exposure in bad weather and falls from the Knife Edge. For about 3/10 of a mile the trail is 3 feet wide, with a drop off on either side. The Knife Edge is closed during periods of high wind. [ Other references ] Two US Navy ships have been named USS &apos;&apos;Katahdin&apos;&apos; after the mountain. Katahdin is also the name of a 1914 steamboat (later converted to diesel ) owned by the Moosehead Marine Museum that plies the waters of Moosehead Lake in northern Maine. The Katahdin potato was named after the mountain [ USDA and is still popular in the Northeastern United States. It was certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1932.
