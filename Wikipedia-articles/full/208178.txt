This article refers to the New World wood warbler family of birds, the Parulidae. For the Eurasian species Phylloscopus sibilatrix, see Wood Warbler. [ New World warblers Protonotaria-citrea-002 edit.jpg Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea) Animal ia Chordata Aves Passeriformes Passeri Parulidae Wetmore et al., 1947 Species See text ] The New World warblers or wood-warblers are a group of small, often colorful, passerine bird s restricted to the New World. They are closely related to neither the Old World warbler s nor the Australian warblers. Most are arboreal, but some, like the Ovenbird and the two waterthrush es, are more terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivore s. It is likely that this group originated in northern Central America, which remains with the greatest diversity and numbers of species. From thence they spread north during the interglacial periods, mainly as migrants, returning to the ancestral region in winter. Two genera, Myioborus and Basileuterus seem to have colonised South America early, perhaps before the two continents were linked, and provide most warbler species of that region. The scientific name for the family, Parulidae, originates from the fact that Linnaeus in 1758 named the Northern Parula as a tit, Parus americanus, and, as taxonomy developed, the genus name was modified first to Parulus and then Parula. The family name, of course, derives from that genus. [ Description ] All the warblers are fairly small. The smallest species is the Lucy&apos;s Warbler (Oreothlypis luciae), at about 6.5  grams and 10.6  cm (4.2  in). The largest species depends upon the true taxonomy of the family. Traditionally, it was listed as Yellow-breasted Chat, at 18.2  cm (7.2  in). Since this may not be parulid, the Parkesia waterthrushes, the Ovenbird, the Russet-crowned Warbler and Semper&apos;s Warbler, all of which can exceed 15  cm (6  in) and 21  grams, could be considered the largest. The migratory species tend to lay larger clutches of eggs, typically up to six, since the hazards of their journeys mean that many individuals will have only one chance to breed. In contrast, two eggs is typical for many tropical species, since the chicks can be provided with better care, and the adults are likely to have further opportunities for reproduction. Many migratory species, particularly those breeding further north, have distinctive male plumage at least in the breeding season, since males need to reclaim territory and advertise for mates each year. This tendency is particularly marked in the large genus Dendroica. In contrast, resident tropical species, which pair for life, show little if any sexual dimorphism. There are of course exceptions. The Parkesia waterthrushes and Ovenbird are strongly migratory, but have identical male and female plumage, whereas the mainly tropical and sedentary yellowthroat s are dimorphic. The Granatellus chats also show sexual dimorphism, but due to recent genetic work have been moved into the family Cardinalidae (New World buntings and cardinals). [ Systematics ] There are a number of issues in the taxonomy and systematics of the Parulidae. The New World warblers are closely related to the tanager s, and some species like the conebill s Conirostrum and the Bananaquit have been placed into either group by different authorities. Currently, the conebills are normally placed in Thraupidae and the Bananaquit in its own family. Green-tailed Warbler, Yellow-breasted Chat, and White-winged Warbler are other species where there have been questions as to whether they should be considered as warblers or tanagers. The Pardusco, Nephelornis oneilli is also of uncertain affinities [ Genera and species ] Bachman&apos;s Warbler, Vermivora bachmanii Blue-winged Warbler, Vermivora cyanoptera Golden-winged Warbler, Vermivora chrysoptera { Genus Oreothlypis } Tennessee Warbler, Oreothlypis peregrina Orange-crowned Warbler, Oreothlypis celata Nashville Warbler, Oreothlypis ruficapilla Virginia&apos;s Warbler, Oreothlypis virginiae Colima Warbler, Oreothlypis crissalis Lucy&apos;s Warbler, Oreothlypis luciae Flame-throated Warbler, Oreothlypis gutturalis Crescent-chested Warbler, Oreothlypis superciliosa Whistling Warbler, Catharopeza bishopi Black-and-white Warbler, Mniotilta varia Genus Setophaga Myrtle Warbler, Setophaga coronata coronata Audubon&apos;s Warbler, Setophaga coronata auduboni Black-fronted Warbler, Setophaga coronata nigrifrons Goldman&apos;s Warbler, Setophaga coronata goldmani { Yellow-throated Warbler, Setophaga dominica } { Bahama Warbler, Setophaga flavescens } { Vitelline Warbler, Setophaga vitellina } { Prairie Warbler, Setophaga discolor } { Adelaide&apos;s Warbler, Setophaga adelaidae } { Barbuda Warbler, Setophaga subita } { St. Lucia Warbler, Setophaga delicata } { Grace&apos;s Warbler, Setophaga graciae } { Black-throated Gray Warbler, Setophaga nigrescens } { Townsend&apos;s Warbler, Setophaga townsendi } { Hermit Warbler, Setophaga occidentalis } { Golden-cheeked Warbler, Setophaga chrysoparia } { Black-throated Green Warbler, Setophaga virens } Prothonotary Warbler, Protonotaria citrea Worm-eating Warbler, Helmitheros vermivorus Swainson&apos;s Warbler, Limnothlypis swainsonii Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapillus Northern Waterthrush, Parkesia noveboracensis Louisiana Waterthrush, Parkesia motacilla Connecticut Warbler, Oporornis agilis Kentucky Warbler, Geothlypis formosus Mourning Warbler, Geothlypis philadelphia MacGillivray&apos;s Warbler, Geothlypis tolmiei Common Yellowthroat, Geothlypis trichas Belding&apos;s Yellowthroat, Geothlypis beldingi Altamira Yellowthroat, Geothlypis flavovelata Bahama Yellowthroat, Geothlypis rostrata Olive-crowned Yellowthroat, Geothlypis semiflava Black-polled Yellowthroat, Geothlypis speciosa Masked Yellowthroat, Geothlypis aequinoctialis Gray-crowned Yellowthroat, Geothlypis poliocephala Hooded Yellowthroat, Geothlypis nelsoni Red-faced Warbler, Cardellina rubrifrons Wilson&apos;s Warbler, Cardellina pusilla Canada Warbler, Cardellina canadensis Red Warbler, Cardellina ruber Pink-headed Warbler, Cardellina versicolor Painted Whitestart, Myioborus pictus Slate-throated Whitestart, Myioborus miniatus Tepui Whitestart, Myioborus castaneocapillus Brown-capped Whitestart, Myioborus brunniceps Yellow-faced Whitestart, Myioborus pariae White-faced Whitestart, Myioborus albifacies Saffron-breasted Whitestart, Myioborus cardonai Collared Whitestart, Myioborus torquatus Spectacled Whitestart, Myioborus melanocephalus Golden-fronted Whitestart, Myioborus ornatus White-fronted Whitestart, Myioborus albifrons Yellow-crowned Whitestart, Myioborus flavivertex Fan-tailed Warbler, Basileuterus lachrymosus Gray-and-gold Warbler, Basileuterus fraseri Two-banded Warbler, Basileuterus bivittatus Golden-bellied Warbler, Basileuterus chrysogaster Choco Warbler, Basileuterus chlorophrys Pale-legged Warbler, Basileuterus signatus Citrine Warbler, Basileuterus luteoviridis Black-crested Warbler, Basileuterus nigrocristatus Gray-headed Warbler, Basileuterus griseiceps Santa Marta Warbler, Basileuterus basilicus Gray-throated Warbler, Basileuterus cinereicollis White-lored Warbler, Basileuterus conspicillatus Russet-crowned Warbler, Basileuterus coronatus Golden-crowned Warbler, Basileuterus culicivorus Three-banded Warbler, Basileuterus trifasciatus White-bellied Warbler, Basileuterus hypoleucus Rufous-capped Warbler, Basileuterus rufifrons Golden-browed Warbler, Basileuterus belli Black-cheeked Warbler, Basileuterus melanogenys Pirre Warbler, Basileuterus ignotus Three-striped Warbler, Basileuterus tristriatus White-rimmed Warbler, Basileuterus leucoblepharus White-striped Warbler, Basileuterus leucophrys Flavescent Warbler, Basileuterus flaveolus Buff-rumped Warbler, Phaeothlypis fulvicauda Neotropical River Warbler, Phaeothlypis rivularis [ Incertae sedis ] Green-tailed Warbler or Green-tailed Ground Warbler, Microligea palustris (Not a parulid) Yellow-headed Warbler, Teretistris fernandinae (Not a parulid) Oriente Warbler, Teretistris fornsi Semper&apos;s Warbler, Leucopeza semperi (possibly related to Teretistris and if so not a parulid) Wrenthrush, Zeledonia coronata (Not a parulid) Yellow-breasted Chat, Icteria virens (Not a parulid) White-winged Warbler, Xenoligea montana (Not a parulid) [ References ] Curson, Quinn and Beadle, 1994.
