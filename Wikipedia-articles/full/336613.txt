He was the sole anchor of ABC&apos;s &apos;&apos;World News Tonight&apos;&apos; from 1983 until his death in 2005 of complications from lung cancer. A high-school dropout, he transformed himself into one of American television&apos;s most prominent journalists. Jennings started his career early, hosting a Canadian radio show at the age of nine. He began his professional career with CJOH-TV in Ottawa during its early years, anchoring the local newscasts and hosting a teen dance show, Saturday Date, on Saturdays. In 1965, ABC News tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program. His inexperience was attacked by critics and others in television news, making for a difficult first stint in the anchor chair. Jennings became a foreign correspondent in 1968, reporting from the Middle East. He returned as one of World News Tonight&apos;s three anchors in 1978, and was promoted to the role of sole anchor in 1983. Jennings was also known for his marathon coverage of breaking news stories, staying on the air for 15 or more hours straight to anchor the live broadcast of events such as the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991, the Millennium celebrations in 2000, and the September 11 attacks in 2001. In addition to anchoring, he was the host of many ABC News special reports and moderated several American presidential debates. Having always been fascinated with the United States, Jennings became a naturalized United States citizen in 2003. Along with Tom Brokaw at NBC and Dan Rather at CBS, Jennings formed part of the &quot; Big Three &quot; news anchors who dominated American evening network news from the early 1980s until his death in 2005, which closely followed the retirements of Brokaw and Rather. [ Life and career ] [ Early life ] Jennings was born on July 29, 1938, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; he and his younger sister Sarah were children of Elizabeth (Osborne) and Charles Jennings, a prominent radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting Peter&apos;s People, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air.

After the CBC moved his father to its Ottawa headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to Lisgar Collegiate Institute. He struggled academically, and Jennings later surmised that it was out of &quot; pure boredom &quot; that he failed 10th grade and dropped out. &quot; I loved girls, &quot; he said. &quot; I loved comic books. And for reasons I don&apos;t understand, I was pretty lazy. &quot; { Lalli, Frank (October 2002). &quot; Peter Jennings: Newsman on the Heartland &quot;. } { Reader&apos;s Digest.

He had hoped that the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him in the small town of Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville, branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including Damn Yankees and South Pacific. { &quot; Where are they now? &quot;. } { Orpheus Musical Theatre Society.

When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand. { Ward, Bruce (August 9, 2005). &quot; Canadian&apos;s wit, insight and authority made him Americans&apos; &apos;centre of gravity&apos; &quot;.

There, he ran into Elmer Lower, then president of ABC News, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. { Sullivan, Patricia (August 8, 2005). &quot; ABC News Anchor Was a Voice of the World &quot;. } { The Washington Post, p.

What if I fail? &quot; Three months later though, he changed his mind and packed his bags for America. [ America&apos;s youngest anchor ] Jennings started reporting for ABC at its New York news bureau. At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of NBC and CBS, and the network was trying to attract younger viewers. On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian from the field and placed him at the anchor desk of Peter Jennings With the News, then a 15-minute nightly newscast. He replaced Ron Cochran, a fellow Canadian. At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor. { Glass, Charles (August 9, 2005). &quot; Peter Jennings &quot;. } { The Independent, p. 32.

Some in the American audience disliked Jennings&apos; Canadian accent. He pronounced lieutenant as &quot; leftenant &quot;, mangled the pronunciation of &quot; Appomattox, &quot; and misidentified the &quot; Marines&apos; Hymn &quot; as &quot; Anchors Aweigh &quot; at Lyndon Johnson &apos;s presidential inauguration; his lack of in-depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a &quot; glamorcaster &quot;. &quot; It was a little ridiculous when you think about it, &quot; he later reflected. &quot; A 26-year-old trying to compete with Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley.

In 1968, he established ABC&apos;s Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. { &quot; Peter Jennings &quot;. } { ABC News. Retrieved on November 30, 2006. } The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC&apos;s Now news program. As ABC&apos;s Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies of the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut. { Fenyvesi, Charles (December 30, 1991 / January 6, 1992). &quot; Washington whispers &quot;. } { US News &amp; World Report through LexisNexis Academic, p. 34.

His live reporting, which drew on the expertise he had acquired in the Middle East, provided context for Americans who were unfamiliar with the Palestinian group. By hiding with his camera crew close to the athletic compound where the Israeli athletes were being held hostage, Jennings was able to provide ABC with clear video of the masked hostage-takers. He would later be criticized for insisting on using the terms &quot; guerillas &quot; and &quot; commandos &quot; instead of &quot; terrorists &quot; to describe the members of Black September. { Friedman, Rachel Zabarkes (July 9, 2004). &quot; Worse than Tom and Dan? &quot;. } { National Review.

He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first American reporter to interview the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris. Meanwhile, ABC News and its newly installed president, Roone Arledge, were preparing an overhaul of its nightly news program, whose ratings had languished in third place behind CBS and NBC since its inception. In the late 1970s, a disastrous pairing of Harry Reasoner and Barbara Walters at the anchor desk left the network searching for new ideas. Arledge decided to implement a three-anchor format for the program. On July 10, 1978, World News Tonight debuted with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago, and Jennings in London. { Waters, Harry F. with Betsy Carter (August 20, 1979). &quot; ABC News Marches On &quot;.

By the summer of 1979, the innovative broadcast, which featured some of the same glitzy presentation as Arledge&apos;s previous television coup, Wide World of Sports, had climbed in the ratings. The newscast had gained 1.9 million households from its debut, and was now in a dead heat with NBC&apos;s evening newscast. Jennings also found renewed success in his personal life. In 1979, he married for the third time to fellow ABC correspondent Kati Marton. That same year, he became a father when Marton gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth. In 1982, Jennings&apos; and Marton&apos;s second child, Christopher, was born. As part of ABC&apos;s triumvirate, Jennings continued to cover major international news, especially Middle East issues. His nightly appearance at an anchor desk in London gave the impression that ABC News was more dedicated to foreign news than the other networks. { Schwartz, Tony (December 12, 1981). &quot; Arledge Fights, Yet Revels in, his Outsider Status &quot; (fee required).

His insistence on covering the major international stories himself irked some of his fellow ABC foreign correspondents, who came to resent being scooped by what they deemed as &quot; Jennings&apos; Flying Circus. &quot; Jennings, too, was not completely satisfied with his job in London. When his contract expired with ABC in the early 1980s, Jennings flirted with the possibility of moving back to Canada and working with the CBC on its new nightly newscast, The Journal.

The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, and the beginning of what the media would deem the &quot; Big Three &quot; era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. &quot; With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces, &quot; he said. &quot; That&apos;s an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is what it comes down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake. &quot; { Smith, Sally Bedell (August 10, 1983). &quot; Peter Jennings Named Sole ABC Anchor &quot;.
