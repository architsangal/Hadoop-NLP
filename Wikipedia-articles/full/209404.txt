Formed in 1995, the band was a major player in the mid-90&apos;s emo scene, otherwise known as the &quot; second wave &quot; of emo music. As they gained prominence, they began touring with bands such as Green Day and Weezer before becoming headliners themselves, eventually embarking on international tours of Japan and Europe.

While the imprint was started to release albums by The Get Up Kids, it served as a launching pad for several side-projects such as The New Amsterdams and Reggie and the Full Effect.

In 2008 the band announced a 2009 reunion tour to support the tenth anniversary re-release of Something to Write Home About, their most successful studio album. Soon after the reunion, the band entered the studio to write new material.

In 2011 they released another album, There Are Rules. [ History ] [ Early years (1995–1997) ] { Emo&apos;s in 1997 } While in high school, Ryan Pope, Rob Pope, and Jim Suptic formed a short-lived band called Kingpin. Matt Pryor had been writing songs since he was a teenager, and was playing in a band called Secret Decoder Ring. [ POP AND JAZZ GUIDE http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9C06E3D7133FF937A25751C1A9679C8B63 New York Times 2001-12-14 2008-03-02 ] Following the demise of the two bands in 1995, The Get Up Kids were formed. The band originally planned on calling themselves &quot; The Suburban Get Up Kids &quot;, until reasoning that there were fewer band names beginning with the letter &apos;G&apos; than there are with the letter &apos;S&apos;, and that therefore they were more likely to be noticed in a record store if their name began with a &apos;G&apos;. The band was formed on October 14, 1995 on Suptic&apos;s 18th birthday. [ Grubbs Eric Post: A Look at the Influence of Post-Hardcore-1985-2007 iUniverse 2008 224–266 0-595-51835-4 ] At the time the lineup consisted of Pryor on guitar and lead vocals, Suptic on guitar, Rob Pope on bass, and Thomas Becker on drums. However, Becker soon left for college in California, and was replaced by Nathan Shay, who was attending school with Suptic at the Kansas City Art Institute. In 1995, Pryor, Suptic, and friend Kevin Zelko saved to self-release &quot; Shorty/The Breathing Method &quot;, their first 7-inch. However, due to an unwillingness to tour, Shay was replaced by Robert&apos;s younger brother Ryan in April 1996. The band became increasingly popular in the burgeoning underground Midwestern music scene, forming strong relationships with bands such as Rocket Fuel is the Key, Coalesce and Braid. After the &quot; Shorty &quot; 7-inch, the band released &quot; A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts &quot;. [ Conoley Ben Vinyl File: Sex Pistols, the Draft, F*cked Up, Coliseum and a Get Up Kids spotlight http://www.punknews.org/article/24898 Punknews.org 2007-08-01 ] Encouraged by interest stirred by the band&apos;s first 7-inch, they recorded their first EP, Woodson. It was released as a 7-inch through Contrast Records, with Doghouse Records releasing a CD-EP version which included the songs from both Woodson and A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts. After Woodson, Doghouse approached the band with a two-album contract, offering them $4,000 to record their first full-length album. [ Four Minute Mile (1997–1998) ] [ The Get Up Kids - Coming Clean.ogg &quot; Coming Clean &quot; &quot; Coming Clean &quot;, from the band&apos;s debut album Four Minute Milepersonifies the hard-edged, DIY-feel of the band&apos;s early work. Ogg ] After signing to Doghouse, the band drove to Chicago to record their debut full-length album with producer Bob Weston of Shellac. The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got out of school and finishing in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan&apos;s high school graduation. It was on that tour that the band met James Dewees, the new drummer for Coalesce while the bands were playing together in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. After the show, the members of the two bands became close friends, eventually leading them to record a split 7-inch produced by Ed Rose entitled &quot; The Get Up Kids / Coalesce &quot;. For the split, each band covered one of the other&apos;s songs in their own style. Coalesce did a post-hardcore cover of &quot; Second Place &quot;, and The Get Up Kids recorded a power-pop rendition of &quot; Harvest of Maturity &quot;. A few months later, the band released their debut full-length record Four Minute Mile, bringing a great deal of attention from critics, fans and labels alike. The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour of Europe and the band rapidly created an overseas fanbase. While the band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention, they became unhappy with Doghouse Records&apos; ability to keep up with the increasing popularity of the band. The Get Up Kids announcement to leave Doghouse Records brought interest from prominent record labels including Sub Pop, Geffen and Mojo Records. The band made a decision to sign to Mojo, but before the contracts were signed, they began to have second thoughts. The main issue was over the label&apos;s insistence on owning merchandising rights, a large source of the band&apos;s income. Moreover, the band was insulted the label requested they re-record &quot; Don&apos;t Hate Me &quot; from Four Minute Mile for their next record, feeling that the label believed it was &quot; the best that [they could] write &quot;. Before the deal with Mojo was official, the band met Rich Egan, founder of Los Angeles-based Vagrant Records. He convinced the band to sign to Vagrant instead, offering them $50,000 to record a second album, as well as their own imprint, Heroes &amp; Villains Records. [ Something to Write Home About (1999–2001) ] { Bowery Ballroom in 2000 } In 1998, James Dewees recorded his first solo album under the pseudonym Reggie and the Full Effect. While Dewees wrote the songs himself, he asked Matt Pryor and Rob Pope to help record some of the instrumentals. The resulting album, Greatest Hits 1984-1987 incorporated a great deal of synthesizer keyboards, leading Pryor to ask Dewees to collaborate with The Get Up Kids on some new songs they were writing. The next year, The Get Up Kids released Red Letter Day, a five-track EP produced by Ed Rose to fulfill their two-record deal with Doghouse. It was Dewees&apos; debut on a Get Up Kids record, although he was still credited as featured musician. The cleaner, more focused sound of the EP provided the chance to experiment with the inclusion of keyboards and is a bridge between the raw sound of Four Minute Mile and the more dynamic style of their next studio album. After the release of Red Letter Day, Dewees joined the band full-time and the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund the production of the album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records. The album&apos;s lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band&apos;s only &apos;true&apos; emo album, as the album&apos;s aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. [ Brackett Nathan Nathan Brackett The New Rolling Stone Album Guide Simon &amp; Schuster 2004 330 0-7432-0169-8 ] Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie label s in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. [ Paul Aubin About Vagrant Records http://www.punknews.org/labels/vagrant Punk News 2008-03-02 ] Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene&apos;s DIY ethic.

Venues booked months in advance could no longer hold the demand by the time the band arrived in town and fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform. To capitalize on anticipation for the band&apos;s next album, Vagrant Records released a rarities compilation Eudora in 2001. Eudora consisted of alternate takes, covers, and B-sides since the band&apos;s formation. Likewise, Doghouse released a re-mastered edition of Four Minute Mile and a compilation entitled The EPs: Woodson and Red Letter Day, combining the two Doghouse-owned EPs on one compact disc. [ On a Wire (2002–2003) ] After three years of touring for Something to Write Home About, the band was beginning to feel burned-out on that material and was looking to experiment with a more mature sound. They also wanted to find a new producer to challenge them creatively, approaching Nigel Godrich and Gil Norton with offers, although both declined. Finally, the band settled on Scott Litt, best known for his work with R.E.M. and Nirvana. [ Pappademas Alex The Get Up Kids – Guilt Show http://www.spin.com/reviews/get-kids-guilt-show Spin 2004-04-19 2008-03-02 ] The band&apos;s third studio album, On a Wire was released on May 14, 2002, debuting the band&apos;s new sound. Just as Something to Write Home About alienated fans with its more produced sound, On a Wire was criticized by fans who were disappointed with the album&apos;s softer musical direction.

Ogg ] While many fans were upset with this sudden change of direction, the album was generally well-received by mainstream publications. Entertainment Weekly was highly positive, writing that &quot; This is the group at their best. &quot; [ Carmanica Jon 2002 5 The Get Up Kids – &quot; On a Wire &quot; Entertainment Weekly May 31, 2002 http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C249666%2C00.html 2009-02-24 ] In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote &quot; On a Wire quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards... The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender. &quot; [ Walters Barry 2002 5 The Get Up Kids: On a Wire Rolling Stone 898 http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C249666%2C00.html 2009-02-24 ] The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band&apos;s popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, only to find that they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label&apos;s top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of On a Wire. In an interview with Alternative Press, lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on On a Wire seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he didn&apos;t think that &quot; anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance &quot;. Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term &quot; emo &quot;, a word that had defined them for years but had come to mean something different. Pryor commented on the album, saying &quot; We really didn’t give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident that we were going to kill this ‘emo’ stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust.” [ Guilt Show (2003–2004) ] In 2003 the band began recording their fourth studio album. The album would be the first recorded in Black Lodge Studios in Eudora, Kansas, a studio renovated and owned by the Pope brothers and producer Ed Rose. The writing process for the album was different than their past efforts, as most of the songs were written by only three of the band members. In the early stages of writing, Jim Suptic was on his honeymoon. James Dewees was involved in a difficult divorce, and much of his creative efforts inspired by those events went into the fourth Reggie and the Full Effect album Songs Not to Get Married To. While this led to a less collaborative effort than in the past, it gave the Pope brothers a more substantial role in writing than ever before. In an interview with Alternative Press, Pryor confirmed the song &quot; Never Be Alone &quot; was written by Rob Pope about his 2003 divorce from The Anniversary keyboardist Adrianne Verhoeven. This fractured approach to the writing process began to strain relationships in the band, at one point leading Suptic to consider quitting the band. Pryor drew lyrical inspiration from the lives of friends and people he knew, extracting stories of abuse, betrayal and guilt. The album&apos;s lyrics also delve into incidents of adultery ( &quot; Wouldn&apos;t Believe It &quot;, &quot; How Long Is Too Long &quot; ) and the album&apos;s first single &quot; The One You Want &quot; is said to be about a woman who Pryor says &quot; Sucks the soul out of people &quot;.

Sonically, the album combined the more measured, sophisticated sound of On a Wire with the frenetic style of their earlier work.

[ Brackett Nathan The New Rolling Stone Album Guide Fireside Books November 2, 2004 330 4th 0-7432-0169-8 ] The more pop-driven tone of the album reunited the band with many fans who were disenchanted after On a Wire, while also staying close enough to the evolution of the last album to interest newer fans and critics. However, their return was overshadowed by the booming popularity of other contemporary emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional, who invited the band to open for them on the 2004 Honda Civic Tour. [ Evans Rob The Get Up Kids join Dashboard Confessional, Thrice on Civic Tour http://www.livedaily.com/news/6421.html LiveDaily 2004-03-01 2009-02-24 ] [ Breakup (2004–2005) ] { Uptown Theater marquee on July 2, 2005 before the band&apos;s farewell concert. } Over the course of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, relationships between the band members continued to decline. The band&apos;s live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times. Matt Pryor&apos;s wife had recently given birth to their first child, and being away from his family had made him irritable and standoffish. [ Matt Pryor: Why He &quot; Quit &quot; The Get Up Kids http://www.lawrence.com/audioclips/147/ Lawrence.com 2005-03-15 2008-12-09 ] After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance hit an all-time low, with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs. At one tour date in England, the tensions came to a head when Ryan Pope confronted Pryor over his recent despondence, leading to a band meeting where Pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment to the rest of the group. After some discussion, the band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band.

The show was recorded and released the following May as the band&apos;s first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater. On Tuesday, March 8, 2005, The Get Up Kids announced that after ten years, they were calling it quits.
