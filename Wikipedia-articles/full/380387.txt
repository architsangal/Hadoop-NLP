Therefore, all else being equal, Louise would have been styled as Her Royal Highness Princess Louise of Wessex. However, when her parents married, the Queen, via a Buckingham Palace press release, announced that (in hopes of avoiding some of the burdens associated with royal titles) their children would be styled as the children of an earl, rather than as princes or princesses. Thus, court communications never refer to her in terms of a princess of the United Kingdom, but simply as The Lady Louise Windsor. There are two opposing opinions as to whether or not Louise is &quot; legally &quot; a princess and Her Royal Highness: Some experts consider the Queen&apos;s press release to not have enough legal force to override the 1917 letters patent, whereas other experts contend that the Queen&apos;s will, however expressed, is law in matters of royal titles and styles.
