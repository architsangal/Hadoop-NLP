[ 1999 ] { NATO.0+55+3d.modular } [ 2001 ] { Mac OS 8, } { Mac OS 9 } { Discontinued } { interdisciplinary m9ndfukc } { Proprietary } NATO.0+55+3d was an application software for realtime video and graphics, released by 0f0003 Maschinenkunst in 1999 for the Mac OS operating system. Being one of the earliest applications to allow realtime video manipulation and display, it was used by artists for a large variety of purposes, prominently for live performance, VJing and interactive installation. [ Design ] Running in the framework of Max (a visual programming interface for rapid prototyping and developing of audio software), NATO.0+55+3d extended Max by allowing to access and manipulate all the media types that QuickTime supports (films, images, 3D models, QuickTime VR, etc.). { Meta 2001 : 151 } The functionalities included image generation, image processing, control over MIDI and numerical data, integration with Internet, 3D, text and sound. [ Applications ] Artists used the software to &quot; manipulate video for live performance and installations &quot; ( Mieszkowski 2002 ). The flexibility of the interface provided artists with &quot; a uniquely suitable environment for the creation of new synesthesiac applications and experiences &quot; ( Meta 2001 ) and &quot; opened up tremendous possibillities for working with realtime video &quot; ( Gilje 2005 ). As NATO was distributed with a software development kit, [ http://www.bootsquad.com/old_site/nato/ A discussion of NATO.0+55+3d modular Bernstein Jeremy 2001 2011-09-12 ] several artists and programmers created third party extensions (e.g. the PeRColate [ Trueman Dan DuBois R.

[ History ] At the time of its release (the summer of 1999 { Gilje 2005 } ), NATO.0+55+3d was in demand as it appeared several years before other similar infrastructures such as GEM and Jitter (produced by the makers of Max/MSP directly). Earlier software such as Image/ine developed in 1997 at STEIM was drawing in a similar direction, [ Kosnik Marko an open letter to imag/ine and nato users and developers 55 mailing-list 2 February 2002 http://mail.bek.no/pipermail/55/2002-February/002807.html 2009-08-26 ] but the fact that NATO.0+55+3d was operating inside the Max/MSP framework, using its &quot; visual programming &quot; protocol, provided at the same time greater ease of use and more flexibility, { &quot; Jitter is far more complicated and more made for engineers/programmers than Nato, which was basically a video object library for max/msp, and more fun - it seemed always so fragile, and easy to loose. &quot; - Mia Makela, aka SOLU, in: } [ http://www.skynoise.net/2005/10/06/solu-dot-org-vj-interview Solu Dot Org : VJ Interview 2005 2007-08-24 ] allowing the user to create his own applications and tools. It gained popularity among video artists and performers, who were using it for a large variety of purposes, prominently for live performance and interactive installation.
