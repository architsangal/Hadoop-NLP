His original land grant was on the north side of Elizabeth Drive, land which today is used for farming research by the CSIRO and University of Sydney. He named his property Exeter Farm but the creek running through his property became known as Badgery&apos;s Creek and this was the name that stuck to the local area. [ http://www.liverpool.nsw.gov.au/adetailedhistoryofliverpool.htm#suburbs History of our suburbs: Badgerys Creek Liverpool City Council 2008-04-12 ] Badgery bought other land to the south of his grant and after he died, the area was subdivided in the 1880s, vastly increasing the local population. A school was established in 1895 and the area gradually developed as a rural suburb which by 1981 had a population of 1560. In 1986, the Federal Government announced it was building the Second Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek. It bought out properties and most of the population moved away so that by 1996 there were fewer than 500 residents. Construction never started on the airport, and the government has now sold much of its holdings for housing, making the site even more unsuitable for an airport. But the $8m 2012 report into Sydney&apos;s aviation needs has found Badgery&apos;s Creek to still be the best site. [ Climate ] Badgerys Creek is one of the driest suburbs of Sydney with the annual precipitation being around 640mm, which is 500mm below Sydney city&apos;s average annual (1,200mm).

Well over half the houses were being rented (57%), largely because of the federal government&apos;s purchase of land in the area. Badgerys Creek was still strongly rural with the three most common industries of employment being freight transport (10.1%), vegetable farming (9.4%) and meat (5.2%).
