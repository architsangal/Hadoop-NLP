{ NOTOC } [ Terek Sandpiper Xenus cinereus (Alnus).jpg 240px LC iucn3.1 Animalia Chordata Aves Neornithes Neognathae Neoaves Charadriiformes Scolopaci Scolopacidae Xenus Kaup, 1829 X. cinereus Xenus cinereus ( Güldenstädt, 1775) Tringa cinereaTringa terek ] The Terek Sandpiper (Xenus cinereus) is a small migratory Palearctic wader species, the only member of the genus Xenus. [ Description and systematics ] { Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary, } { Andhra Pradesh, } { India. } Slightly larger than the Common Sandpiper at 22–25  cm length, its long upcurved bill – somewhat reminiscent of an avocet &apos;s, but not as strongly curved – makes it very distinctive. As the scientific specific name implies, this wader has a grey back, face and breast in all plumage s; a white supercilium may appear more or less distinct. The belly is whitish and the feet yellow; the bill has a yellowish base, with the rest being black. The call is a high whistle. Among the Scolopacidae, Xenus is part of the shank - tattler - phalarope clade and less closely related to the calidrid sandpipers. Based on the degree of DNA sequence divergence and putative shank and phalarope fossil s from around the Oligocene / Miocene boundary some 23-22 million years ago, the Terek Sandpiper presumably diverged from their relatives in the Late Oligocene. Given the numerous basal fossils of the group found in Eurasia it is likely that the Terek Sandpiper lineage originated there, possibly by being isolated as the remains of the Turgai Sea dried up, which happened just around this time. { Mlíkovský (2002), Paton et al. (2003), Thomas et al. (2004) } [ Distribution and ecology ] This bird breeds near water in the taiga from Finland through northern Siberia to the Kolyma River, and migrate south in winter to tropical coasts in east Africa, south Asia and Australia, usually preferring muddy areas. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, and particularly in autumn it is sometimes seen passing through the Marianas on migration; on Palau, further off its usual migration route, it is decidedly uncommon on the other hand. Almost annually and apparently more and more often in recent times, a few birds stray to Alaska and the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands. Every few years, individual vagrants are recorded in the Neotropics, where they arrive either as migrating birds from Africa, or as North American strays accompanying local waders south for winter. Such vagrants have been recorded as far south as Argentina. { Wiles et al. (2004), VanderWerf et al. (2006), White et al. (2006) } It feeds in a distinctive and very active way, chasing insects and other mobile prey, and sometimes then running to the water&apos;s edge to wash its catch. It lays three or four eggs in a lined ground scrape. { Xenus cinereus &apos;&apos; &amp; Little Stint &apos;&apos; } { Calidris minuta &apos;&apos; in } { Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary, } { Andhra Pradesh, } { India. } The Terek Sandpiper likes to associate with Ruddy Turnstone s (Arenaria interpres), smallish calidrid s, and Charadrius (but maybe not Pluvialis ) plover s; a vagrant bird at Paraty ( Rio de Janeiro state ) was noted to pair up with a Spotted Sandpiper (Actitis macularius). { White et al. (2006) } Thus it may be that the Terek Sandpiper under natural conditions may mate with Common Sandpiper (A. hypoleucos), the Old World sister species of Spotted Sandpiper (A. macularius). As hybridisation in shorebirds is extremely commonplace and Actitis is among the closer relatives of the Terek Sandpiper, such pairings (should they indeed occur) may produce hybrid offspring. This is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) applies. Widespread and often quite commonly seen, the Terek Sandpiper is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. { BLI (2008) } [ Footnotes ] [ References ] [ Xenus cinereus ] [ BirdLife International (BLI) 2008 144007 Xenus cinereus 3 January 2009 ] [ Check digit (8) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] [ 10.1016/S1055-7903(03)00098-8 ] [ 10.1186/1471-2148-4-28 ] Mlíkovský, Jirí (2002): Cenozoic Birds of the World, Part 1: Europe.
