[ April 2012 ] [ the film the novel Forrest Gump (novel) other uses Forrest Gump (disambiguation) ] [ 1994 7 6 ] { 141  minutes } { English } { $55  million } { $677,387,716 } Forrest Gump is a 1994 American epic comedy-drama romance film based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis, starring Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Gary Sinise. The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a naïve and slow-witted native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century. The film differs substantially from Winston Groom&apos;s novel on which it is based, including Gump&apos;s personality and several events that were depicted. Filming took place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate the protagonist into archived footage and to develop other scenes. A comprehensive soundtrack was featured in the film, using music intended to pinpoint specific time periods portrayed on screen. Its commercial release made it a top-selling soundtrack, selling over 8  million copies worldwide. Released in the United States on July 6, 1994, Forrest Gump was well-received by critics and became a commercial success as the top grossing film in North America released that year. The film earned over $677  million worldwide during its theatrical run. The film won the Academy Award s for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Zemeckis, Best Actor for Tom Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects and Best Film Editing. It also garnered multiple other awards and nominations, including Golden Globe Awards, People&apos;s Choice Awards and Young Artist Awards, among others. Since the film&apos;s release, varying interpretations have been made of the film&apos;s protagonist and its political symbolism. In 1996, a themed restaurant opened based on the film, and has since expanded to multiple locations worldwide. The scene of Gump running across the country is often referred to when real life people attempt the feat.

He starts with telling about the } { braces he wore on his legs as a child, which caused other children to bully him. At school, Forrest met Jenny ( } { Robin Wright ), an abused girl who became his lifelong friend. Her advice to Forrest was to &quot; run &quot; whenever he got into trouble. Forrest ran constantly, eventually allowing him to discard his leg braces and &quot; run like the wind blows. &quot; } Despite having below average intelligence, Forrest earned a scholarship to the University of Alabama after Bear Bryant spotted Forrest running away from bullies. While in college, he witnessed George Wallace &apos;s infamous Stand in the Schoolhouse Door and was named to the All-American football team, who met with President John F. Kennedy. After graduating, Forrest enlisted in the Army and was sent to Vietnam, where he became friends with Benjamin Buford &quot; Bubba &quot; Blue ( Mykelti Williamson ), a man whose lifelong dream was to buy a shrimping boat. When the platoon was ambushed, Forrest&apos;s &quot; running &quot; saved many of the men in his unit as Forrest ran repeatedly into the firefight and carried them to safety. Bubba died, while the platoon&apos;s commanding officer, Lt. Dan Taylor ( Gary Sinise ), lost both legs. Forrest himself was injured and awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon B. Johnson. While recovering from his injuries, Forrest discovered an aptitude for ping pong. He began playing for the U.S. Army team, eventually competing against Chinese teams on a goodwill tour. He went to the White House for a third time to meet President Richard Nixon who provided him a room at the Watergate hotel, where Forrest, reporting what he thought was a power outage, inadvertently exposed the Watergate scandal. Because of his many accomplishments, Forrest was invited to appear on the Dick Cavett Show. While in New York for the filming, he again met Lt. Dan, now an embittered drunk and living on welfare. Lt. Dan was scornful of Forrest&apos;s plans to enter the shrimping business and jokingly promised to be Forrest&apos;s first mate if he ever succeeded. Using money from his ping-pong career, Forrest bought a shrimping boat, fulfilling his wartime promise to Bubba. Lt. Dan kept his earlier promise and joined him as first mate. They initially had little luck, but after Hurricane Carmen swept away the rest of their competition, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company became a huge success. At the same time, Forrest returned home to care for his dying mother. Forrest left the company in the hands of Lt. Dan, who invested their wealth in shares from Apple. The two men became extremely wealthy. Jenny returned to visit Forrest at his old home, eventually staying for an undetermined time. One day after dinner, Forrest asked her to marry him, and after she declined, he left the house. Later, Jenny climbed into Forrest&apos;s room and they slept together, but she left in a cab the following morning. Distraught, Forrest decided to go for a long run. Over the next three years, he ran coast to coast several times, gathering a group of followers. In the end, as suddenly as he had begun, he ran home to Alabama to find a letter from Jenny. Forrest says that Jenny&apos;s letter invited him to come and see her, which is why he was waiting for the bus. An elderly woman who has been listening to his story tells him that Jenny&apos;s address is only a few blocks away, and he runs to meet her. Once they are reunited, he discovers they have a young son, also named Forrest ( Haley Joel Osment ). Jenny tells him that she is suffering from an unknown virus. She proposes to him and he accepts. They return to Alabama with their son and marry, but Jenny dies soon after. On his son&apos;s first day of school, Forrest sits with his son at the bus stop. As the bus picks Forrest Jr. up and drives away, Forrest sits on the same tree stump where his own mother sat on Forrest&apos;s first day of school, the day he met Jenny.

Along the way, he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. John Travolta was the original choice to play the title role, and admits passing on the role was a mistake. Bill Murray was also considered for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after an hour and a half of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest&apos;s pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Bob Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel. Hanks agreed to take the role only on the condition that the film was historically accurate. Michael Conner Humphreys portrayed the young Forrest Gump. Hanks revealed in interviews that after hearing Michael&apos;s unique accented drawl, he incorporated it into the older character&apos;s accent. Robin Wright as Jenny Curran: Gump&apos;s childhood friend who enters his life at various times in adulthood, eventually becoming mother to his son and later marrying Gump. Jenny is a survivor of child sexual abuse, which results in her struggles with self-destructive behavior throughout much of her life. She eventually sorts herself out and becomes a waitress in Savannah, Georgia where she lives in an apartment with her (their) son, Forrest, Junior. She dies from an unknown virus, which reviewers and authors speculated as being HIV/AIDS. Zemeckis reflected on Wright&apos;s portrayal of the role, &quot; Robin exudes a kind of strength and, at the same time, a vulnerability. She doesn&apos;t bring any of her stardom to the role. You don&apos;t look at her on-screen and think that this is Robin Wright&apos;s interpretation of the character. She&apos;s a real chameleon. &quot; Hanna R. Hall portrayed the young Jenny Curran. Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan Taylor: Gump and Bubba&apos;s commanding officer during the Vietnam War, who comes from a long line of soldiers with a dubious history of dying in combat. After losing his legs in an ambush and being rescued against his will by Forrest, he falls into a deep depression. He later serves as Forrest&apos;s first mate at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, gives most of the orders, and regains his will to live and ultimately forgives Forrest for his actions in Vietnam and acknowledges that Gump saved his life. By the end of the film, he is engaged to be married and is sporting &quot; magic legs &quot; – titanium alloy prosthetics which allow him to walk again. Mykelti Williamson as Benjamin Buford &quot; Bubba &quot; Blue: Bubba is Gump&apos;s friend whom he meets upon joining the Army. Throughout filming, Williamson wore a lip attachment to create Bubba&apos;s protruding lip. David Alan Grier, Ice Cube and Dave Chappelle were all offered the role before turning it down. Chappelle claimed he believed the film would be unsuccessful and has also admitted that he regrets not taking the role. Bubba was originally supposed to be the senior partner in the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, but, due to his death in the line of duty in Vietnam, his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan Taylor took his place. The company posthumously carried this name. Sally Field as Mrs. Gump: Forrest&apos;s mother, who raises him after his father abandons them. Field reflected on the character, &quot; She&apos;s a woman who loves her son unconditionally.... A lot of her dialogue sounds like slogans, and that&apos;s just what she intends. &quot; Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Gump, Jr.: Forrest and Jenny&apos;s son. Osment was cast in the film after the casting director noticed him in a Pizza Hut commercial. Peter Dobson as Elvis Presley : a house guest Forrest encounters. Although Kurt Russell was uncredited, he provided the voice over for Elvis Presley in the scene where Presley met Gump. Dick Cavett as himself. Cavett played the 1970s version of himself, with makeup applied to make him appear younger. Consequently, Cavett is the only well-known figure in the film to play a cameo role rather than be represented through the use of archival footage. Sam Anderson as Principal Hancock: Forrest&apos;s elementary school principal. Richard D&apos;Alessandro as Abbie Hoffman : A Yippie at a Vietnam War rally who gives Forrest a chance to speak about the war. Geoffrey Blake as Wesley: A member of the SDS group and Jenny&apos;s abusive boyfriend. Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Dorothy Harris: The school bus driver who drives both Forrest, and later his son, to school. Sonny Shroyer as Coach Paul &quot; Bear &quot; Bryant : Forrest&apos;s football coach of the University of Alabama. Grand L. Bush, Conor Kennelly, and Teddy Lane Jr. as the Black Panthers : Members of an organization that protests against the Vietnam War, President Lyndon B. Johnson, and anti-black racism. Bill Roberson as Large Man on Bench: An older man who sits on the bench next to Forrest in Savannah, Georgia and listens to Gump&apos;s stories. [ Production ] [ Script ] [ Forrest Gump (novel) ] [ 30em #c6dbf7 &quot; The writer, Eric Roth, departed substantially from the book. We flipped the two elements of the book, making the love story primary and the fantastic adventures secondary. Also, the book was cynical and colder than the movie. In the movie, Gump is a completely decent character, always true to his word. He has no agenda and no opinion about anything except Jenny, his mother and God. &quot; ] The film is based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom. Both center on the character of Forrest Gump. However, the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the novel with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest, Jr. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump&apos;s life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the Continental US. [ Delarte Alonso Movies By The Book: Forrest Gump Bob&apos;s Poetry Magazine PDF February  2004 http://bobspoetry.com/Bobs01Fe.pdf 24 July 2, 2009 ] Gump&apos;s core character and personality are also changed from the novel; among other things his film character is less of an autistic savant —in the novel, while playing football at the university, he fails craft and gym, but receives a perfect score in an advanced physics class he is enrolled in by his coach to satisfy his college requirements. The novel also features Gump as an astronaut, a professional wrestler, and a chess player. Two directors were offered the opportunity to direct the film before Robert Zemeckis was selected.

The randomness of experience? &quot; [ Lyall Sarah It&apos;s &apos;Forrest Gump&apos; vs. Harrumph http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/weekinreview/it-s-forrest-gump-vs-harrumph.html The New York Times July 31, 1994 October 21, 2010 http://www.webcitation.org/5texWzYFD October 21, 2010 ] Hanks interpreted the feather as: &quot; Our destiny is only defined by how we deal with the chance elements to our life and that&apos;s kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge. &quot; [ Forrest Gump-(Through the eyes of Forrest Gump) DVD Paramount Pictures 23:27 August 28, 2001 ] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: &quot; It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance? &quot; [ Forrest Gump-(Through the eyes of Forrest Gump) DVD Paramount Pictures 23:57 August 28, 2001 ] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: &quot; It can mean so many things to so many different people. &quot; [ Forrest Gump-(Through the eyes of Forrest Gump) DVD Paramount Pictures 26:29 August 28, 2001 ] The feather is stored in a book titled Curious George, Forrest&apos;s favorite book, which his mother read to him, connecting the scene&apos;s present time with his childhood in the 1940s. The placement of the feather in the book is directly on a picture of the monkey walking on a tightrope. Whether that was intentional or not, it is very symbolic. The feather also has a correlation with Jenny&apos;s constant obsession with &quot; becoming a bird and flying far far away &quot; due to the abuse (sexual and physical) she endured from her father. She goes as far in the film as to ask Forrest &quot; if [she] jumped off the bridge, could [she] fly? &quot; [ Political interpretations ] In Tom Hanks&apos; words, &quot; The film is non-political and thus non-judgmental &quot;. Nevertheless, in 1994, CNN&apos;s Crossfire debated whether the film promoted conservative values or was an indictment of the counterculture movement of the 1960s. Thomas Byers, in a Modern Fiction Studies article, called the film &quot; an aggressively conservative film &quot;. [ Byers Thomas B.

But, Forrest Gumpisn&apos;t about politics or conservative values. It&apos;s about humanity, it&apos;s about respect, tolerance and unconditional love. &quot; ] It has been noted that while Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Curran&apos;s life is full of countercultural embrace, complete with drug usage and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of tongue-in-cheek reconciliation. Jennifer Hyland Wang argued in a Cinema Journal article that Curran&apos;s death to an unnamed virus &quot;...symbolizes the death of liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade [1960s]. &quot; She also notes that the film&apos;s screenwriter, Eric Roth, when developing the screenplay from the novel, had &quot;...transferred all of Gump&apos;s flaws and most of the excesses committed by Americans in the 1960s and 1970s to her [Curran]. &quot; Other commentators believe that the film forecast the 1994 Republican Revolution and used the image of Forrest Gump to promote his traditional, conservative values. Jennifer Hyland Wang observes that the film idealizes the 1950s, as evidenced by the lack of “whites only” signs in Gump&apos;s southern childhood, and “revisions” the 1960s as a period of social conflict and confusion. She argues that this sharp contrast between the decades criticizes the counterculture values and reaffirms conservatism. [ Wang Jennifer &quot; A Struggle of Contending Stories &quot; : Race, Gender, and Political Memory in &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; Cinema Journal Spring, 2000 39 3 92–115 10.1353/cj.2000.0009 ] As viewed by Political Scientist Joe Paskett, this film is &quot; one of the best films of all time. &quot; [ Gordinier Jeff Mr. Gump Goes to Washington http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C296004%2C00.html Entertainment Weekly February 10, 1995 October 21, 2010 http://www.webcitation.org/5texZkMKf October 21, 2010 ] Wang argued that the film was used by Republican politicians to illustrate a &quot; traditional version of recent history &quot; to gear voters towards their ideology for the congressional elections. In addition, presidential candidate Bob Dole cited the film&apos;s message in influencing his campaign due to its &quot;...message that has made [the film] one of Hollywood&apos;s all-time greatest box office hits: no matter how great the adversity, the American Dream is within everybody&apos;s reach. &quot; In 1995, National Review included Forrest Gump in its list of the &quot; Best 100 Conservative Movies &quot; of all time. [ Quillen Ed Why are modern conservatives so enchanted with Forrest Gump? Denver Post May 7, 1995 ] Then, in 2009, the magazine ranked the film number four on its 25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years list. [ Miller John J. The Best Conservative Movies http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q%3DYWQ4MDlhMWRkZDQ5YmViMDM1Yzc0MTE3ZTllY2E3MGM%3D National Review February 23, 2009 October 21, 2010 http://www.webcitation.org/5texch3Dn October 21, 2010 ] &quot; Tom Hanks plays the title character, an amiable dunce who is far too smart to embrace the lethal values of the 1960s. The love of his life, wonderfully played by Robin Wright Penn, chooses a different path; she becomes a drug-addled hippie, with disastrous results. &quot; James Burton, a professor at Salisbury University, argued that conservatives claimed Forrest Gump as their own due less to the content of the film and more to the historical and cultural context of 1994. Burton claimed that the film&apos;s content and advertising campaign were affected by the cultural climate of the 1990s, which emphasized family values and “American values” - values epitomized in the successful book Hollywood vs. America. He claimed that this climate influenced the apolitical nature of the film, which allowed for many different political interpretations. [ Burton James Amos Film, History and Cultural Memory: Cinematic Representations of Vietnam-Era America During the Culture Wars, 1987-1995 PhD Thesis September 2007 ] Burton points out that many conservative critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after the popularity of the film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton implies that the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements. Some commentators see the conservative readings of Forrest Gump as indicants of the death of irony in American culture. Vivian Sobchack notes that the film&apos;s humor and irony relies on the assumption of the audience&apos;s historical (self-) consciousness. [ Soundtrack ] [ Forrest Gump (soundtrack) Forrest Gump - Original Motion Picture Score ] The 32-song soundtrack from the film was released on July 6, 1994. With the exception of a lengthy suite from Alan Silvestri &apos;s score, all the songs are previously released; the soundtrack includes songs from Elvis Presley, Fleetwood Mac, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Aretha Franklin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Three Dog Night, The Byrds, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, The Mamas And The Papas, The Doobie Brothers, Bob Seger, and Buffalo Springfield, Michael McDonald among others. Music producer Joel Sill reflected on compiling the soundtrack: &quot; We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods, yet we didn&apos;t want to interfere with what was happening cinematically. &quot; [ Rice Lynette Songs Set the Mood for &apos;Gump&apos; http://news.google.com/newspapers?id%3DSzcTAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3DhOoDAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3D5648%2C4299465%26amp%3Bdq%3Dforrest%2Bgump%2Bsoundtrack Gainesville Sun August 14, 1994 July 3, 2009 ] The two-disc album has a variety of music from the 1950s–1980s performed by American artists. According to Sills, this was due to Zemeckis&apos; request, &quot; All the material in there is American. Bob (Zemeckis) felt strongly about it. He felt that Forrest wouldn&apos;t buy anything but American. &quot; The soundtrack reached a peak of second place on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; charts. The soundtrack went on to sell twelve  million copies, and is one of the top selling albums in the United States.

[ Sequel ] [ Gump and Co. ] The screenplay for the sequel was written by Eric Roth in 2001. It is based on the original novel&apos;s sequel, Gump and Co. that was written by Winston Groom in 1995. Roth&apos;s script begins with Forrest sitting on a bench waiting for his son to return from school.

Pocket Books 1996 1 0-671-52264-7 ] The first chapter of the book suggests that the real-life events surrounding the film have been incorporated into Forrest&apos;s storyline, and that Forrest got a lot of media attention as a result of the film. During the course of the sequel novel, Gump runs into Tom Hanks and at the end of the novel is the film&apos;s release, including Gump going on The David Letterman Show and attending the Academy Awards.
