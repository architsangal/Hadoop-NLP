The team was founded prior to the 1999 season. The team is owned by Glen Taylor, who also owns the Lynx&apos; NBA counterpart, the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Lynx have qualified for the WNBA Playoffs in three of their thirteen years in Minnesota. The franchise has been home to many high-quality players such as Katie Smith, explosive small-forward Seimone Augustus, hometown point guard Lindsay Whalen, and Connecticut standout Maya Moore. The team is the reigning champion of the WNBA, having won the 2011 WNBA Finals. [ Franchise history ] [ Joining the league (1998–2004) ] On April 22, 1998, the WNBA announced they would add two expansion teams (Minnesota and the Orlando Miracle ) for the 1999 season. The team was officially named the Minnesota Lynx on December 5, 1998. The Lynx started their inaugural season in 1999 with 12,122 fans in attendance to watch the first regular-season game against the Detroit Shock at Target Center. The Lynx defeated Detroit 68–51 in the franchise&apos;s first game. They finished their first season 15–17 overall and held the same record in 2000. In 2001, the Lynx took a turn for the worse as they posted a 12–20 record. The Lynx&apos; first head coach Brian Agler was released during the 2002 season after compiling a 47–67 record in three-plus seasons. Heidi VanDerveer became the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. The team finished finish the 2002 season with a 10–22 record, worst in franchise history (until 2006). In 2003, the Lynx hired Suzie McConnell Serio as head coach. She led the team to finish with a franchise-best 18–16 record and advanced to the WNBA Playoffs for the first time. They matched both of these feats in the 2004 season. [ Seimone Augustus joins the team (2005–2007) ] Seimone Augustus The 2005 season was one of transition for the franchise. Leading scorer Katie Smith was dealt to Detroit in July and the team stumbled down the stretch, missing the playoffs for the first time in three years. The poor finish did pay off however, as the team won the draft lottery and selected All-American guard Seimone Augustus of Louisiana State University with the first overall pick in the 2006 WNBA Draft. The Lynx began the 2006 season as the youngest team in the WNBA. On May 31, the team set the WNBA single game scoring record (at the time), routing the Los Angeles Sparks by a score of 114–71. That victory however, was a rare bright spot in a frustrating season. With her team floundering to an 8–15 record, head coach Suzie McConnell Serio resigned on July 23. She was replaced by assistant Carolyn Jenkins, who piloted the squad to a 2–9 finish. The team&apos;s 24 losses set a franchise record. Following the season, Augustus was named the 2006 WNBA Rookie of the Year. The 22-year-old was the second player in team history to win the award. On December 13, 2006, the Lynx named veteran NBA assistant Don Zierden their fifth head coach. His staff included Carolyn Jenkins former Lynx player Teresa Edwards. In the 2007 WNBA Draft, the Lynx traded center Tangela Smith, who they acquired in the dispersal draft from the Charlotte Sting, to the Phoenix Mercury for point guard Lindsey Harding, who had been selected first overall. The Lynx began the 2007 season 0–7, lost ten straight in July and failed to get into the playoff race. They finished tying a league worst 10–24 record. On November 1, 2007, assistant coach/former head coach Carolyn Jenkins was named Director of Player Personnel of the WNBA. [ Hot starts without results (2008–2009) ] The 2008 season started out much different for the Lynx than in previous years. They came flying out of the gates, going 7–1 in the first five weeks of the season. The Lynx then cooled off. They managed to play competitive basketball all season, but lost many key games down the stretch. In the end, the Lynx finished with a respectable 16–18 record in a tough Western Conference where every team was in the playoff chase until the final week of the season. The Lynx however, did not qualify After two consecutive 10–24 seasons, the 2008 Lynx was a step in the right direction. In 2009, Don Zierden resigned just days before the start of the season. Jennifer Gillom who replaced Teresa Edwards as an assistant coach the previous year, was promoted to head coach. Another Zierden Lynx assistant, former NBA player Jim Petersen stayed with Gillom during the season, working with post players Charde Houston and Nicky Anosike. The Lynx saw similar results in 2008...started with a good run (7–3), but lost many key games, including a horrific six-game losing streak, and finished 14–20, out from the playoffs for the fifth straight season. [ A new team and the first championship (2010–present) ] After five disappointing seasons, the offseason brought much more impact to the franchise. The team hired former Detroit Shock assistant coach Cheryl Reeve as their new head coach, parting ways with Jennifer Gillom, who took the head coaching job of the Los Angeles Sparks. The Lynx also made some moves in the off-season by selecting Rebekkah Brunson in the Sacramento Monarchs dispersal draft, and trading their first overall pick of the 2010 WNBA Draft and Renee Montgomery to the Connecticut Sun for former Minnesota Gopher Lindsay Whalen and the second overall pick. They added free agent Hamchétou Maïga to the lineup, and selected University of Virginia guard Monica Wright with the second pick in the 2010 Draft. With these offseason transactions, the Lynx looked forward to a much improved 2010 season, which was echoed by the eighth annual WNBA general manager poll. Forty-five percent of the general managers declared the Lynx the most-improved team as the 2010 season began. The selection of Maya Moore during the 2011 WNBA Draft led many people to believe the Lynx to be championship contenders for the 2011 season. The team finally lived up to expectations in 2011, behind stellar play from Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Maya Moore, and Lindsay Whalen, all of whom were named to the 2011 Western Conference All-Star Team. The Lynx went into the All-Star break with a 10–4 record, good for first place in the conference. { http://www.sportspagemagazine.com/content/header/features/lynx-look-to-keep-special-season-going-as-second-h.shtml?48048 } After losing to Phoenix in a 112–105 contest at Target Center on July 13, the Lynx went on a nine-game winning streak, a franchise record and the longest in the league for 2011. It is the third longest streak in WNBA history. The team finished with a 27-7 record, best in the WNBA and in team history. The Lynx earned the top overall seed in the 2011 WNBA Playoffs. In the first round, they defeated the San Antonio Silver Stars two-games-to-one in the best of three series. The Lynx then swept the Phoenix Mercury in two games to win their first conference championship. { Lynx vs. Mercury WNBA Game Report } In the Finals, the Lynx trailed at halftime in each game, but rallied each time to sweep the Atlanta Dream in three games, securing their first WNBA title. Seimone Augustus was named Finals MVP. [ Uniforms ] The home uniforms are white with blue, green, and silver trim. &quot; Lynx &quot; is written on the jerseys in green. The road uniforms are blue with silver, white and green trim and &quot; Minnesota &quot; written in silver. As part of the move to Adidas &apos;s Revolution 30 technology, the Lynx made subtle changes such as rounded numbers in silver. In addition, the team nickname will be featured prominently on both the home and away jerseys. They also eliminated green from the uniforms. The Lynx are also one of 10 WNBA teams sponsored by Boost Mobile and is prominently featured on their uniforms. [ Lynx Foundation ] The Minnesota Lynx Foundation holds an annual &quot; Catwalk for a Cure &quot; event at the Mall of America during the WNBA &apos;s Breast Health Awareness Week to raise funds for breast cancer related charities. The 2011 event was held Aug. 5 and raised $5,000 for Susan G. Komen for the Cure. { http://www.wnba.com/lynx/community/ } [ LosLynx ] &quot; LosLynx &quot; is the unofficial rallying cry of the Minnesota Lynx. The term&apos;s genesis was a 2010 commercial for Bing that parodied telenovella s. The commercial ended with a man yelling &quot; Los Links! &quot; Lynx guard Lindsay Whalen was amused by the commercial and the obvious homophone, and began imitating the cry in practice. When guard Candice Wiggins, who had been injured for much of the 2010 season, returned in 2011, she heard the phrase in practice. It reminded her of her own thoughts regarding promotions in NBA cities with significant Spanish-speaking populations, in which teams like the Miami Heat would wear jerseys identifying them as &quot; El Heat. &quot; She had thought that a promotion for &quot; Los Lynx &quot; would be entertaining. { Los Lynx Worldwide } Eventually, Wiggins tweeted the term as a hashtag on a post about the team. From there, the meme quickly spread throughout the fanbase, inspiring chants and cheers, and even appearing on T-shirts sold by Lynx forward Charde Houston. { #LosLynx } In addition to LosLynx, the hashtag #LYNXANITY became a popular post-win tweet for Lynx fans during the 2011 playoffs.
