The academy was founded in January 1936 by Rukmini Devi Arundale. Under Arundale&apos;s guidance the institution achieved national and international recognition for its unique style and perfection. In 1962, Kalakshetra moved to a new campus in Besant Nagar, Chennai, India, occupying 40 hectares (99 acres) of land [ Kalashethra http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/india/chennai/28585/kalakshetra/nightlife-detail.html 2011-12-03 ].

Rukmini Devi Arundale, along with her husband, Dr. George Arundale, a known theosophist, in Adyar, Chennai in 1936. She not only invited the best of students, but also noted teachers, musicians and artists to be a part of this institution. { Early years of Kalakshetra tamilnation.org } Year long celebrations, including lectures, seminars and festivals marked her 100th birth anniversary, on February 29, in 2004 at Kalakshetra and elsewhere in many parts of the world, [ Another centenary celebration http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/01/27/stories/2003012700070300.htm The Hindu Jan 27, 2003 ] also on Feb 29, a photo exhibition on her life opened at the Lalit Kala Gallery in New Delhi, and on the same day, President A.P.J.

She introduced group performances and staged various Bharatanatyam-based ballets. According to Shri Sankara Menon (1907–2007), who was her associate from Kalakshetra’s beginnings, [ Guru who inspired love (Sankara Menon’s centenary at Kalakshetra) http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/28/stories/2007092850930100.htm The Hindu Sep 28, 2007 ] Rukmini Devi raised Bharatanatyam to a puritan art form, divorced from its recently controversial past by &quot; removing objectionable elements &quot; (mostly, the Sringara, certain emotional elements evocative of the erotic, such as hip, neck, lip and chest movements) from the Pandanallur style, which was publicly criticized by Balasaraswati and other representatives of the traditional devadasi culture. Not all love was portrayed, at least outside parameters considered &quot; chaste &quot;. Balasaraswati said that &quot; the effort to purify Bharatanatyam through the introduction of novel ideas is like putting a gloss on burnished gold or painting the lotus &quot;. E.Krishna Iyer said about Rukmini Devi, “There is no need to say that before she entered the field, the art was dead and gone or that it saw a renaissance only when she started to dance or that she created anything new that was not there before”.
