Records Bushwick Bill Scarface Willie D Prince Johnny C The Slim Jukebox DJ Ready Red Big Mike Raheem ] Geto Boys (originally spelled Ghetto Boys) are a rap group from Houston, Texas, consisting of Scarface, Willie D, and Bushwick Bill. The Geto Boys have earned notoriety for their lyrics which cover controversial topics such as misogyny, gore, psychotic experiences, and necrophilia. Despite the explicit content of their songs, critic Alex Henderson argues that the group &quot; comes across as much more heartfelt than the numerous gangsta rap...wannabes who jumped on the gangsta bandwagon in the early ’90s. &quot; [ Review of We Can&apos;t be Stopped 2007-12-21 Henderson Alex Allmusic ] The Geto Boys broke new ground with their soulful southern sound (a precursor to the Dirty South style). [ March 2012 ] [ History ] The original &quot; Ghetto Boys &quot; consisted first of Raheem, The Slim Jukebox, and Sir Rap-A-Lot. When Raheem and Sir Rap-A-Lot left, the group added DJ Ready Red, Prince Johnny C, and Little Billy (the dancer who later came to be known as Bushwick Bill ). The first single the group released was &quot; Car freak &quot; in 1986, which then followed with two LPs &quot; You Ain&apos;t Nothin&apos;/I Run This &quot; in 1987, and &quot; Be Down &quot; in 1988. The group released their debut album in 1988 entitled, Making Trouble. With the release receiving very little attention, the group broke up shortly thereafter and a new line-up was put together with the inclusion of Scarface and Willie D, both aspiring solo artists. This new line-up recorded the 1989 album, Grip It! On That Other Level. The group&apos;s 1990 self-titled album, The Geto Boys, caused Def American Recordings, the label to which the group was signed at the time, to switch distributors from Geffen Records to Warner Bros. Records (with marketing for the album done by WB sister label Giant Records ) because of controversy over the lyrics. In the early 1990s, several American politicians attacked rap artists associated with the sub-genre, gangsta rap, including the Geto Boys. A high-profile incident in which Bushwick Bill lost an eye in a shooting with his girlfriend helped boost sales of the group&apos;s 1991 album, We Can&apos;t Be Stopped. The album cover features a picture of the injured Bushwick being carted through a hospital by Scarface and Willie D. On the album&apos;s title track, the group responded to Geffen Records ending its distribution deal with Def American. The album featured the single, &quot; Mind Playing Tricks on Me &quot;, which became a big hit in the hip-hop community and even charted well on the pop charts reaching #23 on the Billboard Hot 100. After Willie D left the group, Scarface and Bushwick Bill continued with the Geto Boys with the addition of Big Mike who made his debut appearance with the group on 1993&apos;s album, Till Death Do Us Part. Although Till Death Do Us Part was certified gold, it was not as well received by fans as the lyrically gifted shoes of Willie D, who also wrote for Bushwick, proved too large to fill for Big Mike. However, the album did spawn one top 40 hit in &quot; Six Feet Deep &quot; which peaked at #40 on the Billboard Hot 100. Subsequently, Big Mike was dropped and Willie D returned for 1996&apos;s critically acclaimed The Resurrection and 1998&apos;s Da Good Da Bad &amp; Da Ugly which Bushwick was not a part of. After three years on hiatus, the group reunited in 2002 to record its seventh album, The Foundation, which was released on January 25, 2005. The Geto Boys were featured on Scarface&apos;s My Homies Part 2 album. The song &quot; Street Life &quot; from the album Till Death Do Us Part was featured on the motion picture South Central. A video clip for the song with footage from the film was released. [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DvnyC-NPEPtk geto boys street life YouTube 2007-04-19 2012-03-31 ] Although the band rarely releases albums or perform together, the interest in the group has never wavered as fans anxiously await one more album or performance. However, the group did come together for a much anticipated reunion at Cypress Hill &apos;s SmokeOut festival in San Bernardino, CA on October 23, 2009.

July 19, 2010. Retrieved on July 20, 2010. } In 2012, the Geto Boys will release a song with the Insane Clown Posse on The Mighty Death Pop! &apos;s &quot; White Pop &quot; bonus album &quot; Mike E. Clark&apos;s Extra Pop Emporium &quot;. [ Lyrics and influence ] The group&apos;s name, Geto Boys, comes from a deliberate misspelling of the word Ghetto. For its first two albums, Making Trouble (1988) and Grip It! On That Other Level (1989), the spelling was the English standard &quot; Ghetto Boys &quot;. For their third album, The Geto Boys, they changed it to the &quot; Geto &quot; spelling, which the group has used since. The Geto Boys&apos; lyrics push gangsta rap themes to extremes, and sometimes focus on rape, necrophilia, murder, explicit sex, cartoonish violence, and hostility toward women. The group is credited for putting the South on the hip hop music map and inspired a legion of acts including 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., UGK, T.I., Goodie Mobb, OutKast, 50 Cent, Chamillionaire, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Young Jeezy, Juvenile, Mystikal, Esham and Insane Clown Posse.

On That Other Level, with songs such as &quot; Mind of a Lunatic &quot; and &quot; Trigga-Happy Nigga &quot;. [ Invalid length. ] { 174–185 } { The Dark Carnival } The Geto Boys&apos; popularity was boosted somewhat in 1999 by the prominent use of two songs— &quot; Damn it Feels Good to Be a Gangsta &quot; (released as a promotional single for the 1992 compilation album Uncut Dope [ http://www.discogs.com/Geto-Boys-Damn-It-Feels-Good-To-Be-A-Gangster/release/1267770 Geto Boys - Damn It Feels Good To Be A Gangster (CD) at Discogs Discogs.com 2012-03-31 ] ) and &quot; Still &quot; (from The Resurrection)—in Mike Judge &apos;s film Office Space, now considered a cult classic. The song &quot; Mind of a Lunatic &quot; has been covered by many recording acts including Marilyn Manson in 2003, as a B-side off the album The Golden Age of Grotesque. The single &quot; Damn it Feels Good to Be a Gangsta &quot; has also been covered by the band Aqueduct and country singer Carter Falco.
