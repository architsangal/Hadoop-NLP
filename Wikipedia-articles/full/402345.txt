Jean Baptiste Charbonneau (February 11, 1805  – May 16, 1866) was an American explorer and guide, fur trapper and trader, military scout during the Mexican-American War, alcalde (mayor) of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, and a gold prospector and hotel operator in California. He spoke French and English, and learned German and Spanish during his six years in Europe from 1823-1829. He also spoke Shoshone and other western American Indian languages, learned during his years of trapping and guiding. Son of Sacagawea, a Shoshone, and Toussaint Charbonneau, her French-Canadian husband, who worked as a trapper and interpreter for the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804-1806, Jean Baptiste was born during the travel. He was taken by his parents as an infant across the country. The Expedition co-leader William Clark and other European Americans nicknamed the boy Little Pomp or Pompy. He lived with Clark in St. Louis, Missouri as a boy, where he attended St. Louis academy. Clark paid for his education. Charbonneau&apos;s image appears with that of his mother on the United States Sacagawea dollar silver coin. He is the only child ever depicted on United States currency. Pompeys Pillar on the Yellowstone River in Montana and the community of Charbonneau, Oregon [ McArthur Lewis A Lewis A. McArthur Lewis L. McArthur Oregon Geographic Names 1928 seventh 2003 Oregon Historical Society Press Portland, OR 0-87595-277-1 190 ] are named for him. [ Childhood ] Jean Baptiste Charbonneau was born to Sacagawea, a Shoshone, and her husband, the French-Canadian trapper Toussaint Charbonneau, in early 1805 at Fort Mandan in North Dakota. This was during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which wintered there in 1804–05. The senior Charbonneau had been hired by the expedition as an interpreter and, learning that his pregnant wife was Shoshone, the captains Lewis and Clark agreed to bring her along. They knew they would need to negotiate with the Shoshone for horses and guides at the headwaters of the Missouri River. Meriwether Lewis noted the boy&apos;s birth in his journal: { efficacy.— } [ http://books.google.com/books/about/Original_journals_of_the_Lewis_and_Clark.html?id%3DkvAtAAAAYAAJ Original journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804–1806 1 257 Meriwether Lewis William Clark Charles Floyd 1904 ] {. } { The infant Charbonneau traveled from North Dakota to the } { Pacific Ocean and back, carried along in the expedition&apos;s boats or upon his mother&apos;s back. His presence is often credited by historians with assuring native tribes of the expedition&apos;s peaceful intentions, as they believed that no war party would travel with a woman and child. } In April 1807, about two years after the expedition, the Charbonneau family moved to St. Louis, at Clark&apos;s invitation. Toussaint Charbonneau and Sacagawea departed for the Mandan villages in April, 1809, and left the boy to live with Clark. In November, 1809, the parents returned to St. Louis to try farming, but left again in April, 1811. Jean Baptiste continued to reside with Clark. Clark&apos;s two-story home, built in 1818, contained an illuminated museum [ 100 ft m ] long by [ 30 ft m ] wide. Its walls were decorated with national flags and life-size portraits of George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, Indian artifacts and mounted animal heads. Upon visiting the museum, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, a geologist and ethnographer, wrote, &quot; Clark evinces a philosophical taste in the preservation of many subjects of natural history. We believe this is the only collection of specimens of art and nature west of Cincinnati, which partakes of the character of a museum, or cabinet of natural history. &quot; [ Henry R Schoolcraft Travels in the Central portions of the Mississippi Valley New York J. and J. Harper 1825 294 ] {. } As a boy, Charbonneau learned from the vast collection. Clark paid for Charbonneau&apos;s education at the St. Louis academy, a Jesuit Catholic school, although the expense was considerable for the time. The school&apos;s single classroom was then located in the storehouse of Clark&apos;s friend, the trader Joseph Robidoux. Brothers James and George Kennerly paid for Charbonneau&apos;s supplies for 1820 and were reimbursed by Clark: [ USA Department of the Interior Abstract of Expenditures by Captain W.

From June through September 1820 and in 1822, Jean Baptiste boarded with Louis Tesson Honoré, a Clark family friend and member of his church, Christ Episcopal. [ Ritter Michael 2005 Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, Man of Two Worlds Charleston Booksurge 1-59457-868-0 ] {. } [ 67 ] The general had helped organize the church in 1819. They lived in St. Ferdinand Township in St. Louis County, Missouri near Charbonneau&apos;s father&apos;s [ 320 acre km2 ] of land. [ Adult life ] On June 21, 1823, at age eighteen, Charbonneau met Duke Friedrich Paul Wilhelm of Württemberg, the nephew of King Freidrich I Wilhelm Karl of Württemberg. [ Brigitte Gastel Lloyd Paul Theroff January 18, 2002 ] {. } Charbonneau was working at a Kaw Indian trading post on the Kansas River near present-day Kansas City, Kansas. Wilhelm was traveling in America on a natural history expedition to the northern plains with Jean Baptiste&apos;s father as his guide. On October 9, 1823, he invited the younger Charbonneau to return to Europe with him, which was agreed upon. The two set sail on the Smyrna from St. Louis in December 1823. Jean Baptiste lived at the duke&apos;s palace in Württemberg for nearly six years, where he learned German and Spanish, and improved his English and French. The latter was still the dominant language of St. Louis, which had first enabled his conversations with the Duke. [ 71 ] According to a 1932 translation of Wilhelm&apos;s journal by the historian Louis C. Butscher, Wilhelm wrote that Charbonneau was &quot; …a companion on all my travels over Europe and northern Africa until 1829. &quot; [ 75 ] [ Hebard Grace Sacajawea: Guide and Interpreter of Lewis and Clark Glendale, CA Clarke 1932 119–24 ] {. } Another scholar questions the accuracy of Butscher&apos;s translation. For instance, in 2001 Albert Furtwangler, noting two more recent translations of the duke&apos;s journals [ Wilhelm Paul trans. Nitske, W Robert Travels in North America 1822–1824 Norman Univ. of Oklahoma Press 1973 ] {. } [ Wilhelm Paul trans. Bek, William First Journey to North America in the Years 1822 to 1824 South Dakota Historical Collections 1938 19 ] {. }, suggests that Charbonneau&apos;s role in Wilhelm&apos;s court may have been less intimate than Butscher&apos;s perhaps romanticized account implied. Charbonneau may have been hired as a servant, rather than invited as a companion. As support, he notes the apparent lack of further contact between the two men after Charbonneau&apos;s return to America. However, lack of contact in itself does not mean Charbonneau was a hired hand. Such an act may have been an insult to Clark, which the duke likely would have avoided. [ Furtwangler Albert Sacagawea&apos;s Son as a Symbol Oregon Historical Quarterly 102 Fall, 2001 3 ] {. } [ Morris Larry E The Fate of the Corps New Haven Yale University Press 2004 ] {. } As with many aspects of his life, little is known for certain about Charbonneau&apos;s time in Europe. [ Children ] Parish records in Wuerttemberg show that while there, Charbonneau fathered a child with Anastasia Katharina Fries, a soldier&apos;s daughter. The baby, Anton Fries, died about three months after his birth. Nearly two decades later, while in California as an alcalde or magistrate, Charbonneau was recorded as being the father of another child. On May 4, 1848, Maria Cantarina Charguana was born to Margarita Sobin, a Luiseño woman, and Charbonneau. Sobin, 23 at the time, traveled to Mission San Fernando Rey de España near Los Angeles for the infant girl&apos;s baptism, performed on May 28, 1848, and recorded by Father Blas Ordaz as entry #1884. Margarita Sobin later married Gregory Trujillo, and some of their descendants may be members of the La Jolla band of Mission Indians. { &quot; Maria Canatarina Charguana, child of Margarita Sobin, &quot; First Book of Baptisms. May 28, 1848, entry #1884, Plaza Church, Los Angeles, California } [ Trapper and hunter ] In November 1829, Charbonneau returned to St. Louis, where he was hired by Joseph Robidoux as a fur trapper for the American Fur Company, to work in Idaho and Utah. [ 84 ] [ Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series Jean Baptiste Charbonneau ] {. } He attended the 1832 Pierre&apos;s Hole rendezvous while working for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. There he fought in the bloodiest non-military conflict that preceded the Plains Indian wars, which began in 1854. [ 88 ] From 1833–49 Charbonneau worked in the fur trade in the Rocky Mountain Trapping System [ Wishart David J The Fur Trade of the American West, 1807–1840, A Geographical Synthesis Lincoln University of Nebraska Press 1979 125–27 ] {. } with other mountain men, such as Jim Bridger, James Beckwourth and Joe Meek. { United States National Park Service: &quot; Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, &quot; The Lewis and Clark Journey of Discovery } { 7th Baronet of Blair &apos;&apos;, 1837, by } { Alfred Jacob Miller } From 1840–42 he worked from Fort Saint Vrain, floating bison hides and tongues [ 2000 mi km ] down the South Platte River to St. Louis. On one of the voyages, he camped with Captain John C. Frémont on his cartographic expedition. In 1843, he guided Sir William Drummond Stewart, a Scottish baronet, on his second long trip to the American West, which was a lavish hunting expedition. [ Victor Frances The River of the West: Life and Adventure in the Rocky Mountains and Oregon Hartford Bliss &amp; Co 1870 474 ] {. } Seeking employment again, in 1844 Charbonneau went to Bent&apos;s Fort in Colorado, where he was chief hunter, and worked also as a trader with southern Plains Indians. William Boggs, a traveler who met him, wrote that Charbonneau &quot; …wore his hair long, [and] was…very high strung… &quot; He reported, &quot; …it was said Charbenau (sic) was the best man on foot on the plains or in the Rocky Mountains. &quot; { Hafen LeRoy, &quot; The W.M. Boggs Manuscript About Bent&apos;s Fort, Kit Carson, the Far West and Life Among the Indians, &quot; The Colorado Magazine 7 (March, 1930): pp. 45-69 } [ Mexican-American War ] In October 1846, Charbonneau, Antoine Leroux and Pauline Weaver were hired as scouts by General Stephen W. Kearny. Charbonneau’s experience with military marches, such as with James William Abert [ 128 ] in August, 1845, along the Canadian River, and his fluency in Indian languages qualified him for the position. Kearny directed him to join Colonel Philip St. George Cooke and Lieutenant William H. Emory on an arduous march from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to San Diego, California, a distance of [ 1100 mi km ]. Their mission was to guide 20 huge Murphy supply wagons to California for the military during the Mexican-American War. [ 136 ] A Mormon contingent of 339 men accompanied U.S. cavalry on the uncharted trail. The marchers became known as the Mormon Battalion. A memorial to the battalion was erected at the San Pedro River, one mile (1.6  km) north of the US–Mexico border near the present-day ghost town of Palominas, Arizona. Cooke noted that from November 16, 1846, to January 21, 1847, Charbonneau assisted 29 times on the march. [ 150 ] Eight of the 20 wagons reached Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, four miles (6  km) from today’s Oceanside, California, and the leaders counted the expedition as a success. Cooke wrote, &quot; History may be searched in vain for an equal march of infantry. &quot; [ Bieber Ralph Exploring Southwestern Trails, 1846–1854 Glendale Arthur H Clark 1938 104 ] {. } Known as the Gila Trail, the wagon road was used by settlers, miners, stagecoaches of the Butterfield Stage line and cattlemen driving longhorns to feed the gold camps. Parts of the route became the Southern Pacific Railroad and U.S. Route 66. In February 1848, knowledge gained about the region was used as the basis of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which established the United States-Mexico border in December 1853 following the Mexican-American War. [ 151 ] [ Alcalde ] In November 1847, Charbonneau accepted an appointment from Colonel John D. Stevenson as alcalde (mayor) at Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. This position made him the only civilian authority, a combined sheriff, lawyer and magistrate, in a post-war region covering about [ 225 sqmi km2 ]. From 1834–50, the lands were owned by rancheros through legally questionable land-grants. The rancheros hired local American Indians, mainly Luiseño, to do agricultural work. Many functioned in virtual servitude, and some rancheros paid them only with liquor. Trying to correct abuses and also facilitate post-war control, in November, 1847, Colonel Richard Barnes Mason, the territorial governor, ordered Charbonneau to force the sale of a large ranch owned by the powerful Jose Antonio Pico, whose family was politically connected. His brother Pio Pico had been the last governor of California under Mexico. { See this page for } [ http://digarc.usc.edu/search/controller/view/chs-m19419.html Portrait of Jose Antonio Pico, the elder brother of Pio Pico and Andrés Pico USC ] {. } On January 1, 1848, Mason banned the sale of liquor to Indians. Such ordinances attacked the foundation of ranchero power and ability to do business. Eventually the changes led to United States civilian control of California. [ 161 ] Although Charbonneau was assisted by Captain J. D. Hunter as he negotiated with Pico, he saw that local resistance would make enforcing Mason&apos;s orders difficult. Charbonneau resigned his post in August, 1848, and was soon followed by Hunter. California statehood on September 9, 1850, ended the post-war difficulties. [ Gold mining ] In September 1848, Charbonneau arrived in Placer County, California at the American River, near what is now Auburn. Arriving early in what became known as the California Gold Rush, he joined only a handful of prospectors. Panning was not done during the hard Sierra Nevada winter or spring runoff, so in June, 1849, he joined Jim Beckwourth and two others at a camp on Buckner&apos;s Bar to mine the river at the Big Crevice. This claim &quot; …was shallow and paid well. &quot; [ Angel Myron Fairchilds MD History of Placer County Oakland Thompson and West 1882 229 ] {. } Charbonneau lived at a site known as Secret Ravine, one of 12 ravines around Auburn. A successful miner, he kept working in the area for nearly sixteen years. Charbonneau afforded the mining region&apos;s highly inflated cost of living. For example, at a time when a good wage in the West was $30 per month, it cost $8–16 per day to live in Auburn. [ 176 ] Transiency was high but Charbonneau was still there in 1860, working as the hotel manager at the Orleans Hotel. { Eighth Decennial Census, 1860 } By 1858 many miners had left the California fields for other gold rushes. In April, 1866, he departed for other opportunities at age 61. He may have headed for Montana to prospect for gold, although sites such as at Silver City and DeLamar in Idaho Territory were much closer. [ 190 ] [ Death ] Inskip ruins It is not clear why Charbonneau left Auburn, California. Before leaving he visited the Placer Herald newspaper and visited with an editor, who wrote later in his obituary, &quot;..he was about [his purpose was] returning to familiar scenes. &quot; [ Obituary Placer Herald July 7, 1866 ] {. } Some of those &quot; familiar scenes &quot; may have been where he had lived and worked as a mountain man east of the Great Basin. His destination also may have been the Owyhee Mountains, where rich placer deposits were discovered in May, 1863. Or perhaps he sought to reach Alder Gulch near Virginia City, Montana, because it had produced $31,000,000 in gold by late 1865. Other possible destinations were the Bannock, Montana gold strikes or—as noted above—the mines at Silver City (formerly Ruby City), Delamar or Boonville. [ Waldemar Lindgren Report on Florida Mountain Idaho State Historical Society Reference 1899 ] {. } His route and travel method likely took him on a stagecoach over Donner Summit and east along the well-traveled Humboldt River Trail to Winnemucca, Nevada, then north to army Camp McDermitt near the Idaho border. [ 197 ] Passing the camp in rugged terrain, the men reached an Owyhee River crossing at present-day Rome, Oregon, where an apparent accident occurred and Charbonneau went into the river. The accident&apos;s cause is unknown, but there are several possibilities. He may have been on a stagecoach operated by the Boise-Silver City-Winnemucca stage company that began its route in 1866 out of Camp McDermitt and in crossing the river, the coach sank. [ 198 ] Or he may have been on horseback and fallen off the river bank or slipped out of the saddle while crossing. The Owyhee River in snowmelt may have turned into whitewater. Other possibilities are he was injured on the land journey, inhaled alkali dust, or fell ill from drinking contaminated water. [ 199 ] The ill Charbonneau was taken to Inskip Station in Danner, Oregon, built in 1865, about [ 33 mi km ] from the river and west of Jordan Valley. It is now a ghost town. The former stage coach, mail stop and general store served travelers to Oregon and the California gold fields. It had its own well, and Charbonneau may have deteriorated from drinking the water. [ 200 ] After his death there, his body was taken one-quarter mile north and interred at 42.9518°N 117.339°W. Charbonneau died on May 16, 1866. A death notice was sent by an unknown writer, likely one of two fellow travelers on the journey east, to the Owyhee Avalanche newspaper and it said he died of pneumonia. [ Owyhee Avalanche Ruby City, ID June 2, 1866 ] {. } This is the first documented evidence of his death. [ 201 ] The Placer Herald obituary writer opined that he succumbed to the infamous &quot; Mountain Fever &quot;, to which many illnesses in the West were attributed. His grave site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is on [ 1 acre m2 ] of land. (It is near the Anderson General Store, which is intact and appears to be in 1940s condition.) Now contained within the [ 6000 acre km2 ] Ruby Ranch, the site was donated to Malheur County, Oregon by the owners. The gravesite has three historical markers. In 1971 the Malheur County Daughters of the American Revolution placed a marker. In 1973 the Oregon Historical Society installed a marker, reading: [ Oregon History Jean Baptiste Charbonneau 1805–1866 This site marks the final resting place of the youngest member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Born to Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau at Fort Mandan (North Dakota), on February 11, 1805, Baptiste and his mother symbolized the peaceful nature of the &quot; Corps of Discovery. &quot; Educated by Captain William Clark at St. Louis, Baptiste at 18 traveled to Europe where he spent six years becoming fluent in English, German, French and Spanish. Returning to American in 1829, he ranged the far west for nearly four decades as mountain man, guide, interpreter, magistrate, and forty-niner. In 1866, he left the California gold fields for a new strike in Montana, contracted pneumonia enroute, reached &quot; Inskips Ranche &quot; here, and died on May 16, 1866. ] In 2000 a third marker was dedicated by the Lemhi-Shoshone tribe. As the son of Sacagawea, a Northern Shoshone who lived in the Lemhi Valley, Charbonneau was considered one of their people. Memorial to Charbonneau at Ft. Washakie Earlier in the twentieth century, some Dr. Grace Raymond Hebard argued that Charbonneau died and was buried at the Shoshone Wind River Indian Reservation. Dr. Charles Eastman, a Santee Sioux, did research that attempted to establish that Charbonneau&apos;s mother Sacagawea died at the reservation on April 9, 1884. Some believe that Charbonneau died in 1885 and was buried next to her. Memorials in their names were erected in 1933 at Ft. Washakie. { Note: See photo of Charbonneau&apos;s memorial on this page, which gives his death as 1885 and states he was buried west of that site in the } { Wind River Mountains. } Eastman did his research in 1924–25, interpreting oral history. But that tradition has been superseded by documentary evidence for both Charbonneau and Sacagawea. In 1964 an edited nineteenth-century journal was published that included the information that Sacagawea died much earlier, on December 20, 1812, of a &quot; putrid fever &quot; (possible following childbirth) at Fort Manuel Lisa on the Missouri River. { Luttig, John. Journal of a Fur Trading Expedition on the Upper Missouri, 1812–13, ed. Stella Drumm, New York: Argosy-Antiquarian Ltd., 1964 } Four 19th-century documents support this earlier date, including a statement by William Clark years after the 1805–07 Lewis and Clark expedition that &quot; Secarjawea was dead. &quot; [ Ottoson Dennis R Toussaint Charbonneau, A Most Durable Man South Dakota History Spring, 1976 152 6 ] {. } [ Legacy and honors ] [ McArthur Lewis A Lewis A.

He is the only child ever depicted on United States currency. Pompeys Pillar on the Yellowstone River in Montana and the community of Charbonneau, Oregon are named after him.
