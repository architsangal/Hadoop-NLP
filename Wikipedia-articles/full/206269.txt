[ March 2010 ] A diagram illustrating vertical integration and contrasting it with horizontal integration In microeconomics and management, the term vertical integration describes a style of management control. Vertically integrated companies in a supply chain are united through a common owner. Usually each member of the supply chain produces a different product or (market-specific) service, and the products combine to satisfy a common need. It is contrasted with horizontal integration. Vertical integration has also described management styles that bring large portions of the supply chain not only under a common ownership, but also into one corporation (as in the 1920s when the Ford River Rouge Complex began making much of its own steel rather than buy it from suppliers). Vertical integration is one method of avoiding the hold-up problem. A monopoly produced through vertical integration is called a vertical monopoly. Nineteenth-century steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie introduced the concept and use of vertical integration. { http://www.slu.edu/x28249.xml } This led other businesspeople to use the system to promote better financial growth and efficiency in their businesses. [ Three types ] Vertical integration is the degree to which a firm owns its upstream suppliers and its downstream buyers. Contrary to horizontal integration, which is a consolidation of many firms that handle the same part of the production process, vertical integration is typified by one firm engaged in different parts of production (e.g. growing raw materials, manufacturing, transporting, marketing, and/or retailing). There are three varieties: backward (upstream) vertical integration, forward (downstream) vertical integration, and balanced (both upstream and downstream) vertical integration. A company exhibits backward vertical integration when it controls subsidiaries that produce some of the inputs used in the production of its products. For example, an automobile company may own a tire company, a glass company, and a metal company. Control of these three subsidiaries is intended to create a stable supply of inputs and ensure a consistent quality in their final product. It was the main business approach of Ford and other car companies in the 1920s, who sought to minimize costs by integrating the production of cars and car parts as exemplified in the Ford River Rouge Complex. A company tends toward forward vertical integration when it controls distribution centers and retailers where its products are sold. [ Examples ] One of the earliest, largest and most famous examples of vertical integration was the Carnegie Steel company. The company controlled not only the mills where the steel was made, but also the mines where the iron ore was extracted, the coal mines that supplied the coal, the ships that transported the iron ore and the railroads that transported the coal to the factory, the coke ovens where the coal was cooked, etc. The company also focused heavily on developing talent internally from the bottom up, rather than importing it from other companies. { Folsom, Burton The Myth of the Robber Barons 5th edition. 2007. pg 65 &quot; only we can develop ability and hold it in our service. Every year should be marked by the promotion of one or more of our young men. &quot; } Later on, Carnegie even established an institute of higher learning to teach the steel processes to the next generation. [ American Apparel ] American Apparel is a fashion retailer and manufacturer that advertises itself as a vertically integrated industrial company.

[ Oil industry ] Oil companies, both multinational (such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips or BP ) and national (e.g. Petronas ) often adopt a vertically integrated structure. This means that they are active along the entire supply chain from locating deposits, drilling and extracting crude oil, transporting it around the world, refining it into petroleum products such as petrol/gasoline, to distributing the fuel to company-owned retail stations, for sale to consumers. [ Telephone ] Telephone companies in most of the 20th century, especially the largest (the Bell System ) were integrated, making their own telephone s, telephone cable s, telephone exchange equipment and other supplies. [ Reliance ] The India n petrochemical giant Reliance Industries has integrated back into polyester fibres from textiles and further into petrochemical s, beginning with Dhirubhai Ambani. Reliance has entered the oil and natural gas sector, along with retail sector. Reliance now has a complete vertical product portfolio from oil and gas production, refining, petrochemicals, synthetic garments and retail outlets. [ Motion picture industry ] From the early 1920s through the early 1950s, the American motion picture had evolved into an industry controlled by a cartel of companies, also known as a &quot; mature oligopoly &quot;. The film industry was led by the Big Eight major film studio s. The most powerful of these studios were the fully integrated Big Five studios: MGM, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, and RKO. These studios not only produced and distributed films, but also operated their own theaters. Meanwhile, the Little Three studios: Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists produced and distributed feature films, but did not own their own theaters. The issue of vertical integration (also known as common ownership) has been a main focus of policy makers because of the possibility of anti-competitive behaviors affiliated with market influence. For example, in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., the Supreme Court ordered the five vertically integrated studios to sell off their theater chains and all trade practices were prohibited (United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 1948). { Oba, Goro, and Chan-Olmstead, Sylvia. &quot; Self-Dealing or Market Transaction?: An Exploratory Study of Vertical Integration in the U.S. Television Syndication Market. &quot; Journal of Media Economics 19.2 (2006): 99-118. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. } The prevalence of vertical integration wholly predetermined the relationships between both studios and networks and modified criterion in financing. Networks began arranging content initiated by commonly owned studios and stipulated a portion of the syndication revenues in order for a show to gain a spot on the schedule if it was produced by a studio without common ownership. { Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) &quot; The Television Will Be Revolutionized &quot;.New York, NY: New York University Press. p.87 } In response, the studios fundamentally changed the way they made movies and did business. Lacking the financial resources and contract talent they once controlled, the studies now relied on independent producers supplying some portion of the budget in exchange for distribution rights.

Apple retail stores sell its own hardware, software and services directly to consumers. [ Problems and benefits ] There are internal and external (e.g. society-wide) gains and losses due to vertical integration. They will differ according to the state of technology in the industries involved, roughly corresponding to the stages of the industry lifecycle. [ Static technology ] This is the simplest case, where the gains and losses have been studied extensively. [ Internal gains ] Lower transaction costs Synchronization of supply and demand along the chain of products Lower uncertainty and higher investment Ability to monopolize market throughout the chain by market foreclosure Strategic independence (especially if important inputs are rare or highly volatile in price, such as REM ) [ Internal losses ] Higher coordination costs Higher monetary and organizational costs of switching to other suppliers/buyers Weaker motivation for good performance at the start of the supply chain since sales is guaranteed and poor quality may be blended into other inputs at later manufacturing stages [ Benefits to society ] Better opportunities for investment growth through reduced uncertainty Local companies are better positioned against foreign competition [ Losses to society ] Monopolization of markets Rigid organizational structure, having much the same shortcomings as the socialist economy (cf. John Kenneth Galbraith &apos;s works) [ Vertical expansion ] Vertical expansion, in economics, is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of companies that produce the intermediate goods needed by the business or help market and distribute its product. Such expansion is desired because it secures the supplies needed by the firm to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product. The result is a more efficient business with lower costs and more profits. Related is lateral expansion, which is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of similar firms, in the hope of achieving economies of scale. Vertical expansion is also known as a vertical acquisition. Vertical expansion or acquisitions can also be used to increase scales and to gain market power. The acquisition of DirectTV by News Corporation is an example of forward vertical expansion or acquisition. DirectTV is a satellite TV company through which News Corporation can distribute more of its media content: news, movies, and television shows. The acquisition of NBC by Comcast Cable is an example of backward vertical integration. In the United States, protecting the public from communications monopolies that can be built in this way is one of the missions of the Federal Communications Commission.
