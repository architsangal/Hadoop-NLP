[ September 2010 ] Professor Thomas (Tom) Cavalier-Smith (born October 21, 1942), FRS, FRSC, NERC Professorial Fellow, is a Professor of Evolutionary Biology in the Department of Zoology, at the University of Oxford. { http://www.cavali.net/cavali/default.asp?menuitemID=131 } He was presented with the International Prize for Biology (a prize of 10 million yen ) in 2004. { The Committee on the International Prize for Biology of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science awards the 2004 International Prize for Biology in the field of &quot; Systematic Biology and Taxonomy &quot; to Prof. Thomas Cavalier-Smith, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, UK. Retrieved December 9, 2006. } [ Life ] He was educated at Norwich School, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (MA) and King&apos;s College London (PhD). From 1967 to 1969, he was a guest investigator at Rockefeller University.He taught in the biophysics department of King’s College London. In 1989 he taught botany at the University of British Columbia. In 1999, he joined the University of Oxford. { http://www.cifar.ca/thomas-cavalier-smith } He won the 2007 Frink Medal of the Zoological Society of London. [ Classification of life ] Cavalier-Smith has published extensively on the classification of protists. One of his major contributions to biology was his proposal of a new kingdom of life: the Chromista, although the usefulness of the grouping is questionable given that it is generally agreed to be an arbitrary (polyphyletic) grouping of taxa. He also proposed that all chromista and alveolata share the same common ancestor, a claim later refuted by studies of morphological and molecular evidence by other labs. He named this new group the Chromalveolate s. He also proposed and named many other high-rank taxa, like Opisthokont a (1987), Rhizaria (2002), and Excavata (2002). Together with Chromalveolata, Amoebozoa (he amended their description in 1998), and Archaeplastida (which he called Plantae since 1981) the six form the basis of current taxonomy of eukaryote s. Prof. Cavalier-Smith has also published prodigiously on issues such as the origin of various cellular organelles (including the nucleus, mitochondria ), genome size evolution, and endosymbiosis. Though fairly well known, many of his claims have been controversial and have not gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community to date. Most recently, he has published a paper citing the paraphyly of his bacteria l kingdom, the origin of Neomura from Actinobacteria and taxonomy of prokaryote s. According to Palaeos.com: Prof. Cavalier-Smith of Oxford University has produced a large body of work which is well regarded. Still, he is controversial in a way that is a bit difficult to describe. The issue may be one of writing style. Cavalier-Smith has a tendency to make pronouncements where others would use declarative sentences, to use declarative sentences where others would express an opinion, and to express opinions where angels would fear to tread. In addition, he can sound arrogant, reactionary, and even perverse. On the other [hand], he has a long history of being right when everyone else was wrong. To our way of thinking, all of this is overshadowed by one incomparable virtue: the fact that he will grapple with the details. This makes for very long, very complex papers and causes all manner of dark murmuring, tearing of hair, and gnashing of teeth among those tasked with trying to explain his views of early life. See, [for example], Zrzavý (2001) [ Zrzavý J 2001 The interrelationships of metazoan parasites: a review of phylum- and higher-level hypotheses from recent morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses http://www.palaeos.com/Eukarya/Eukarya.Origins.2.html#Plasma_Membrane Folia Parasitol 48 81–103 ] [and] Patterson (1999). { Patterson, DJ (1999). The diversity of eukaryotes. Amer. Naturalist 65: S96-S124. Apusomonadida, Eukarya. } Nevertheless, he deals with all of the relevant facts. { Origins of the Eukarya Cited on February 9, 2009. } [ The first two kingdoms of life: plants and animals ] { Carl Linnaeus was a distinguished member of the animal kingdom. } The use of the word &quot; kingdom &quot; to describe the living world dates as far back as Linnaeus (1707–1778) who divided the natural world into three kingdoms: animal, vegetable, and mineral. { Dan H. Nicolson. Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?. Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century held at the University of Maryland on 4 November 1996. Edited by James L. Reveal } [ Scamardella Joseph M., 1999 Not plants or animals: a brief history of the origin of Kingdoms Protozoa, Protista and Protoctista http://www.im.microbios.org/08december99/03%20Scamardella.pdf PDF Internatl Microbiol 2 207–216 ] The classifications &quot; animal kingdom &quot; (or kingdom Animalia ) and &quot; plant kingdom &quot; (or kingdom Plantae ) remain in use by modern evolutionary biologists. { Redwood trees are distinguished members of the vegetable kingdom. } By 1910 the animal kingdom had been subdivided into twelve phyla : protozoa, porifera, coelenterata, platyhelminthes, nemathelminthes, trochhelminthes ( Rotifers and Gastrotricha ), molluscoida, echinodermata, annulata ( Polyzoa, Phoronida, and Brachiopoda ), arthropoda, mollusca, and chordata. The protozoa were originally classified as members of the animal kingdom. { Douglas A. Penny and Regina Waern. Biology. An Introduction to aspects of Modern Biological Science. (1965) Pitman Publishing. Vancouver Calgary Toronto Montreal. Pages 626-640. } Now they are classified as a separate group. Zoology is the study of animals while botany is the study of plants. While zoologists divided the animal kingdom into phyla, botanists carved the plant kingdom into &quot; divisions &quot;. By 1940, botanists had carved the plant kingdom into five divisions: Thallophyta ( Algae, Fungi, Bacteria, and Lichenes ), Charophyta, Bryophyta ( Heptacae and Musci ), Pteridophyta, and Spermatophyta. Fungi and bacteria were included within the plant division thallophyta. Today, bacteria are no longer classified as plants and fungi are known to be more closely related to animals than to plants. [ The third kingdom: protists ] { sea anemone is an animal that resembles a plant. } By mid-nineteenth century, microscopic organisms were generally classified into four groups: Protozoa (primitive animals), Protophyta (primitive plants), Phytozoa (animal-like plants &amp; plant-like animals), and Bacteria (formerly regarded as plants). In 1858, Richard Owen (1804–1892) proposed that the animal phylum Protozoa be elevated to the status of kingdom. In 1860, John Hogg (1800–1869) proposed that protozoa and protophyta be grouped together into a new kingdom which he called &quot; Primigenum &quot;. According to Hogg, this new classification scheme prevented &quot; the unnecessary trouble of contending about their supposed natures, and of uselessly trying to distinguish the Protozoa from the Protophyta &quot;. In 1866, Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) proposed the name &quot; Protista &quot; for the Primigenum kingdom and included bacteria in this third kingdom of life. [ The fourth kingdom: fungi ] { enokitake, } { buna-shimeji, bunapi-shimeji, } { king oyster mushroom and } { shiitake. } { Fungi } are more closely related to animals than to plants. By 1959, Robert Harding Whittaker (1920–1980) proposed that fungi, which were formerly classified as plants, be given their own kingdom. His four kingdoms of life were: the Protista, (or unicellular organisms); the Plantae, (or multicellular plants); the Fungi; and the Animalia (or multicellular animals). Whittaker subdivided the Protista into two subkingdoms: Monera ( bacteria ) and Eunucleata (single celled eukaryotes ). R. H. Whittake. On the Broad Classification of Organisms. The Quarterly Review of Biology, Vol. 34, No. 3 (Sep., 1959), pp. 210-226. [ The fifth kingdom: bacteria ] Bacteria are fundamentally different from the eukaryote s ( plant s, animal s, fungi, amebas, protozoa, and chromista ). Eukaryotes have cell nuclei, bacteria do not. In 1969, Robert Whittaker elevated the bacteria to the status of kingdom. His new classification system divided the living world into five kingdoms: plants, animals, protists (excluding bacteria), fungi, and Monera (the kingdom bacteria). Benjamin S. Weeks, and I. Edward Alcamo. Microbes and Society, Second Edition. Page 32. Note: the word &quot; protist &quot; is ambiguous. Eunucleata = single celled eukaryotes Before 1959: protist = prokaryotes + Eunucleata + sponges From 1959 to 1969: protist = prokaryotes + Eunucleata Since 1969: protist = Eunucleata [ The three domains of life ] Phylogenetic tree based on Woese et al. rRNA analysis in 1990 Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 87 12 4576–9 1990 2112744 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 54159 1990PNAS...87.4576W The kingdom Monera can be divided into two distinct groups: eubacteria and archaebacteria. In 1977 Carl Woese and George E. Fox proposed that eubacteria and archaebacteria both be elevated to the status of super-kingdom. { Gert Korthof, (2007). Carl Woese: from scientific dissident to textbook orthodoxy. Cited February 11, 2009. } In 1990, Woese further elevated the status of bacteria by dividing life into three domains : eubacteria (which he called &quot; Bacteria &quot; ), archaebacteria (which he called &quot; Archaea &quot; ), and eukaryotes (which he called &quot; Eukaryota &quot; ). eukaryotes = plants + chromista + animals + fungi + Eunucleata prokaryotes = Monera = eubacteria + archaebacteria Note: the modern use of the word &quot; bacteria &quot; is ambiguous. It may refer either to eubacteria (as in the above phylogenetic tree) or prokaryotes (as in reference to the kingdom Monera). [ The seventh kingdom: chromista ] { brown algae are a member of the kingdom Chromista. } By 1981, Cavalier-Smith had divided the domain Eukaryota into nine kingdoms. { Cavalier-Smith T. Eukaryote kingdoms: seven or nine? Biosystems. 1981;14(3-4):461-81. [Additional Related Articles &amp; #93; } By 1993, he reduced the total number of eukaryote kingdoms to six. He also classified the domains Eubacteria and Archaebacteria as kingdoms, adding up to a total of eight kingdoms of life: Plantae, Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Chromista, and Archezoa. Cavalier-Smith&apos;s new classification scheme retained the plant, animal and fungal kingdoms from the traditional five kingdom model. It also split the kingdom Monera into the two groups, eubacteria and archaebacteria, as proposed by Woese and Fox. In addition it split the kingdom protists into three new kingdoms: archezoa, protozoa, and chromista. Most chromists are photosynthetic. This distinguishes them from most other protists. In both plants and chromists photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. In plants, however, the chloroplasts are located in the cytosol while in chromists the chloroplasts are located in the lumen of their rough endoplasmic reticulum. This distinguishes chromists from plants. [ The eighth kingdom: archezoa ] Cavalier-Smith&apos;s eighth kingdom, Archezoa [ Cavalier-Smith T Chao EE., 1996 Dec Molecular phylogeny of the free-living archezoan Trepomonas agilis and the nature of the first eukaryote J Mol Evol 43 6 551–62 8995052 10.1007/BF02202103 ] is now defunct. He now assigns former members of the kingdom Archezoa to the phylum Amoebozoa. { Thomas Cavalier-Smith. Only six kingdoms of life. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004) } [ Kingdom protozoa ] Cavalier-Smith referred to what remained of the protist kingdom, after he removed the kingdoms Archezoa and Chromista, as the &quot; kingdom Protozoa &quot;. In 1993, this kingdom contained 18 phyla as summarized in the following table: { T.Cavalier-Smith.

The phylum Opalozoa was established by Cavalier-Smith in 1991. { T. Cavalier-Smith. The Protozoan Phylum Opalozoa. Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology Volume 40 Issue 5, Pages 609 - 615. } [ Cavalier-Smith&apos;s six kingdom models ] By 1998, Cavalier-Smith had reduced the total number of kingdoms from eight to six : Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae (including red and green algae ), Chromista and Bacteria. { T. CAVALIER-SMITH. A revised six-kingdom system of life. Biological Reviews (1998), 73 : 203-266. } Five of Cavalier-Smith&apos;s kingdoms are classified as eukaryotes as shown in the following scheme: Kingdom Animalia Kingdom Fungi { Bikont s (primarily } { photosynthetic ) } Kingdom Plantae (including red and green algae) Kingdom Chromista Eukaryotes are divided into two major groups: unikont s and bikont s. Uniciliates are cells with only one flagellum and unikonts are descended from uniciliates. Unikont cells often have only one centriole as well. Biciliate cells have two flagella and bikonts are descended from biciliates. Biciliates undergo ciliary transformation by converting a younger anterior flagellum into a dissimilar older posterior flagellum. Animals and fungi are unikonts while plants and chromista are bikonts. Some protozoa are unikonts while others are bikonts. The Bacteria (= prokaryotes) are subdivided into Eubacteria and Archaebacteria. According to Cavalier-Smith, eubacteria is the oldest group of terrestrial organisms still living. He classifies the groups which he believes are younger (archaebacteria and eukaryotes) as neomura. [ His 1998 model ] [ Kingdom animalia ] In 1993, Cavalier-Smith classified Myxozoa as a protozoan parvkingdom. By 1998, he had reclassified it as an animal subkingdom. Myxozoa contains three phyla, Myxosporidia, Haplosporidia, and Paramyxia, which were reclassified as animals along with Myxozoa. Likewise, Cavalier-Smith reclassified the protozoan phylum Mesozoa as an animal subkingdom. In his 1998 scheme, the animal kingdom was divided into four subkingdoms: Radiata (phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, and Ctenophora ), Myxozoa, Mesozoa, and Bilateria (all other animal phyla). He created three new animal phyla: Acanthognatha ( rotifers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, and gnathostomulids ), Brachiozoa ( brachiopods and phoronids ), and Lobopoda ( onychophorans and tardigrades ) and recognized a total of 23 animal phyla. [ Kingdom protozoa ] Under Cavalier-Smith&apos;s proposed classification system, protozoa share the following traits: they have or are descended from organisms with mitochondria they have or are descended from organisms with peroxisomes they lack collagen ous connective tissue they lack epiciliary retronemes (rigid thrust-reversing tubular cilia ry hairs) they lack two additional membranes outside their chloroplast envelope Organisms that do not meet these criteria were reassigned to other kingdoms by Cavalier-Smith. [ His 2003 model ] [ Kingdom protozoa ] In 1993, Cavalier-Smith divided the kingdom Protozoa into two subkingdom s and 18 phyla. By 2003 he used phylogenic evidence to revise the total number of proposed phyla down to 11: Amoebozoa, Choanozoa, Cercozoa, Retaria, Loukozoa, Metamonada, Euglenozoa, Percolozoa, Apusozoa, Alveolata, Ciliophora, and Miozoa. [ Amoebas ] Amoebas ( AmE : amebas) do not have flagella and are difficult to classify as unikont or bikont based on morphology. In his 1993 classification scheme, Cavalier-Smith incorrectly classified amoebas as bikonts. Gene fusion research later revealed that the clade Amoebozoa, was ancestrally uniciliate. In his 2003 classification scheme, Cavalier-Smith reassigned Amoebozoa to the unikont clade along with animals, fungi, and the protozoan phylum Choanozoa. Plants and all other protists where assigned to the clade Bikont by Cavalier-Smith. Cavalier-Smith&apos;s 2003 classification scheme: uniciliate protozoan phylum Choanozoa kingdom Fungi kingdom Animalia { Bikont s } phylum Cercozoa phylum Retaria ( Radiozoa and Foraminifera ) { protozoan infrakingdom } { Excavata } phylum Loukozoa phylum Metamonada phylum Euglenozoa phylum Percolozoa { protozoan phylum } { Apusozoa ( } { Thecomonadea and } { Diphylleida ) } { the } { chromalveolate clade } phylum Ciliophora phylum Miozoa ( Protalveolata, Dinozoa, and Apicomplexa ) { kingdom } { Plantae ( } { Viridaeplantae, } { Rhodophyta and } { Glaucophyta ) } [ Cladogram ] By September 2003, Cavalier-Smith&apos;s tree of life looked like this: [ Stechmann Alexandra Cavalier-Smith Thomas The root of the eukaryote tree pinpointed http://www.cladocera.de/protozoa/stechmann_2003_cb.pdf 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00602-X 12956967 PDF Current Biology 13 17 ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Retaria Cercozoa ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Kingdom Chromista Alveolata ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] [ Choanozoa Kingdom Animalia ] [ Kingdom Fungi ] In the above tree, the traditional plant, animal, and fungal kingdoms, as well as Cavalier-Smith&apos;s proposed Chromista kingdom, are shown as leaves. The leaves Eubacteria and Archaebacteria together make up the Bacteria kingdom. All remaining leaves together make up the protozoa kingdom. By 2010 new data emerged that showed that Unikonts and Bikonts, originally considered to be separate because of an apparently different organization of cilia and cytoskeleton, are in reality more similar than previously thought. As a consequence, Cavalier-Smith revised the above tree and proposed to move its root to reside in between the Excavata and Euglenozoa kingdoms.
