It operates bus, light rail, and commuter rail services throughout the state, notably connecting to major commercial and employment centers both within the state and in the adjacent cities of New York and Philadelphia. Covering a service area of [ 5325 sqmi km2 ], NJ Transit is the nation&apos;s largest statewide public transit system and the nation&apos;s third largest provider of bus, rail and light rail transit by ridership, { Vantuono, William C. &quot; New Jersey&apos;s innovators: New Jersey Transit&apos;s billion-dollar capital budget is focused on creating a unified, statewide network of commuter and light rail lines. New technologies are a key part of that strategy &quot;, } { Railway Age, April 2004. Accessed August 22, 2007. &quot; In late 2003, 20 years after portions of the Pennsylvania, Erie-Lackawanna, Jersey Central, and Lehigh Valley railroads or their successors were combined to form the nation&apos;s third-largest commuter rail system, Secaucus Junction opened. &quot; } linking major points in New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia. New Jersey Transit also acts as a purchasing agency for many private operators in New Jersey, with numerous private operators receiving equipment from New Jersey Transit (primarily buses) for route service within the state not controlled by New Jersey Transit. [ History ] [ July 2009 ] [ January 2007 ] New Jersey Transit, founded in June 1979, was an offspring of the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), mandated by the state government to address the many transportation issues that had developed at the time. NJ Transit came into being with the passage of the Public Transportation Act of 1979 to &quot; acquire, operate and contract for transportation service in the public interest. &quot; NJ Transit originally acquired and managed a number of private bus services. Conrail (or Consolidated Rail Corporation) had been formed in 1976 through the merging of a number of financially troubled railroads, and operated commuter railroad service under contract from the NJDOT. In 1983, NJ Transit assumed operation of all commuter rail service in New Jersey from Conrail. It now operates every passenger and commuter rail line in the state except for Amtrak; the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH), which is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; the PATCO Speedline, which is owned by the Delaware River Port Authority; two SEPTA Regional Rail lines, the West Trenton Line and the Trenton Line; and a handful of tourist trains in the southern and northwestern parts of New Jersey. New Jersey Transit also runs most of the state&apos;s bus lines. In northern New Jersey, many of the bus routes are arranged in a web. In southern New Jersey, most routes are arranged in a &quot; spoke-and-hub &quot; fashion, with routes emanating from Trenton, Camden, and Atlantic City. In addition to routes run by New Jersey Transit, NJ Transit also subsidizes and provides buses for most of the state&apos;s private operators, such as Coach USA, DeCamp, Lakeland, and Academy, providing fixed route or commuter service. Since inception, rail ridership has quadrupled. In the 1990s, the system expanded, with new Midtown Direct service to New York City and new equipment. On October 21, 2001 it opened a new station at Newark Liberty International Airport. On December 15, 2003, NJ Transit opened the Secaucus Junction transfer station, connecting two major portions of the system, allowing passengers on trains based out of Hoboken Terminal to switch to other trains to get to Midtown Manhattan more conveniently. The transfer saves passengers headed into Midtown Manhattan an estimated 15 minutes of travel time. Previously, passengers on trains into Hoboken had to connect to PATH trains at Hoboken to get to Midtown or Lower Manhattan. On October 31, 2005, NJT took over Clocker (NY-Philadelphia) service from Amtrak. Four new trains were added to the schedule, but service was cut back to Trenton. [ Current operations ] { Penn Plaza East in } { Newark } New Jersey Transit&apos;s operations are divided into three classes: bus, rail, and light rail, operated under three legal businesses: NJ Transit Bus Operations, Inc, for bus and Newark Light Rail operations, subsidiary NJ Transit Mercer, Inc. for bus operations around Trenton, and NJ Transit Rail Operations, Inc., for commuter rail operations. [ Bus ] [ New Jersey Transit Bus Operations ] New Jersey Transit operates service on 247 bus routes and the Newark Light Rail using 2,477 buses { NTD filings for New Jersey Transit } (leasing out the remainder to private operators) and 20 light rail vehicles (with numerous other line runs being subsidized by New Jersey Transit), { NJT Press Release with key facts about the agency at the bottom of the page } The complete bus fleet, including buses purchased by New Jersey Transit for other New Jersey operators above the 2,477, can be viewed here. [ Light Rail ] [ Light rail in New Jersey ] New Jersey Transit operates three separate light rail lines: [ 20.6 mi km ] [ 4.3 mi km ] [ 1.0 mi km ] [ 34 mi km ] Hudson-Bergen Light Rail – a 24-stop, multi-branch line that runs along the Gold Coast from Bayonne to North Bergen, with a major stop at Hoboken Terminal, all in Hudson County. The fleet consists of 52 Kinki Sharyo electric light rail vehicles owned by NJ Transit and operated under contract by 21st Century Rail. Newark Light Rail – a line consisting of two segments serving Newark and the surrounding area. The Newark City Subway segment has 12 stops, is long, and runs from Newark Penn Station to North Newark and Bloomfield. The Broad Street Extension segment has 5 stops in total, is long, and connects Newark Penn Station to Newark Broad Street Station. The fleet consists of 21 Kinki Sharyo electric light rail vehicles owned and operated by the Central Division of New Jersey Transit Bus Operations. River Line – a 20-stop, line running from Trenton to Camden along the Delaware River, mostly along the Bordentown Secondary line formerly owned by Conrail and CSX. The fleet consists of 20 Stadler GTW diesel light rail vehicles owned by NJ Transit and operated under contract by Southern New Jersey Rail Group. [ Rail ] [ New Jersey Transit Rail Operations ] NJ Transit has 11 commuter rail lines: Morristown Line Gladstone Branch { North Jersey Coast Line } { Northeast Corridor Line (includes the } { Princeton Branch ) } { Pascack Valley Line } { Raritan Valley Line } Additional special event service is provided on the Meadowlands Rail Line. NJ Transit operates over 100 diesel locomotive s, of which 11 are supplied by Metro-North Railroad as part of an operating agreement for the Port Jervis Line, and 61 electric locomotive s. Its fleet consists of over 650 push-pull cars, of which 65 are supplied by Metro-North, and 230 electric multiple unit cars. [ Police Department ] [ New Jersey Transit Police Department ] The New Jersey Transit Police Department (NJTPD) is the transit police force for the New Jersey Transit Corporation. It is a general-powers police agency with state wide jurisdiction with the primary focus on policing the numerous bus depots, rail and light-rail stations throughout New Jersey. The department currently employs 240 sworn police officers. [ Proposed projects ] [ section May 2011 ] [ Bus rapid transit ] [ Bus rapid transit in New Jersey ] Bus rapid transit in New Jersey includes limited stop bus lines, exclusive bus lanes (XBL) and bus bypass shoulders (BBS). Next Generation Bus [ NJ Transit Bus Service: The Next Generation Presentation APTA New Jersey Transit April 10, 2010 http://www.apta.com/mc/multimodal/previous/2010/Presentations/New-Jersey-Transit-BRT-Initiatives-Go-Bus28-and-Reuse-of-a-Right-of-way-in-Union-County.pdf 2012-03-03 ] [ Evaluation of Next Generation Bus (BRT- type) Service in the NJTPA Region NPTPA http://www.njtpa.org/Plan/Studies/next_gen_brt_study.aspx 2012-04-30 ] is the term used by NJT to refer to the development of numerous bus rapid transit (BRT) systems across the state which are being studied by the agency, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), the metropolitan planning organizations of New Jersey (MPO), and contract bus carriers. In 2011, NJT announced that it would equip its entire bus fleet with devices for real-time locating, thus creating the basis for &quot; next bus &quot; scheduling information at bus shelter s and web-abled devices and considered an important feature of BRT. [ Northern Branch ] [ Northern Branch Corridor Project ] New Jersey Transit is planning to extend the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail from its current terminus into Englewood or Tenafly along the Northern Branch, an existing freight rail line. [ Rouse Karen Going with electric trains The Record 2009-07-19 http://www.northjersey.com/news/transportation/bridges_tunnels/Going_with_electric_trains.html 2009-07-19 ] As of 2012, a draft environmental impact statement has been released, but no funding has been identified. [ Passaic-Bergen Rail Line ] [ Passaic-Bergen Rail Line ] The Passaic-Bergen Passenger Rail Project is a project that would reintroduce passenger service on a portion of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway right-of-way between Hawthorne and Hackensack using newly built Diesel Multiple Unit rail cars. { http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo &amp; PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2313 } { http://www.northjersey.com/bergen/NJ_Transit_to_expand_passenger_train_service.html } [ Lackawanna Cut-Off ] [ Lackawanna Cut-Off ] In May 2001, the State of New Jersey acquired the right-of-way of the Lackawanna Cut-Off. This line, constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad between 1908 and 1911, provided a direct route, with minimal curves and grades between Slateford Junction, two miles (3.25  km) below the Delaware Water Gap, to the crest of the watershed at Lake Hopatcong ( Port Morris Junction ), the connection with NJ Transit &apos;s Montclair-Boonton Line. At the time of the Cut-Off&apos;s construction, the DL &amp; W already had extensive experience with concrete construction, but not on the scale that would be employed on the Cut-Off. Indeed, all of the structures on the line, including stations, bridges, interlocking towers and two large viaducts, not to mention thousands of fence posts, were made of concrete. Despite the lack of maintenance on these structures over the past four decades (and in some cases much longer), most are still in operational or near-operational condition. A 2004 study conducted by New Jersey Transit estimates that bringing the line back into operation to Scranton, PA would cost approximately $350 million. In 2011, the retracking of the Cut-Off from Port Morris to Andover, NJ, a distance of 7.3 miles (11.8 km) began. Re-opening that section of the line is currently slated for 2014. The proposed rehabilitation west of Andover, which has not yet been funded, would provide commuter rail service between Scranton, Pennsylvania and Hoboken Terminal on the Hudson River waterfront in New Jersey (with connecting service to trains serving New York&apos;s Penn Station ). Service to Midtown Manhattan would be made available to the growing exurban communities in Monroe County in the Poconos, and in upper Warren County and lower Sussex County. { NJ Transit – New Jersey-Pennsylvania Lackawanna Cut-off Passenger Rail Restoration Project Draft Environmental Assessment } [ Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex (MOM) ] The Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex (MOM) { MOM Map of Alternatives } line is a proposed south and central New Jersey commuter rail route offering those counties&apos; residents access to New Brunswick, Newark and New York&apos;s Penn Station. The line was originally proposed by the Ocean County Board of Chosen Freeholders in March 1980. This route would run on a 40.1-mile rail corridor and would provide diesel commuter rail service from Monmouth Junction ( South Brunswick ), where the Jamesburg Branch partially joins the Northeast Corridor (NEC), to Lakehurst. As of 2006, the line was opposed by Jamesburg and Monroe Township. From Monmouth Junction, the line would continue southeast to Jamesburg, Monroe, Englishtown, Manalapan, Freehold Borough, Freehold Township, Howell and Farmingdale. A new rail connection would be required in Farmingdale. It would proceed southward from Farmingdale to Lakehurst, passing through Howell, Lakewood, Jackson, Toms River Township, and Lakehurst/ Manchester. Trains on this line would also operate on the NEC between Monmouth Junction and Newark. Passengers destined for New York would transfer at Newark. Eight new stations and a train storage yard would be constructed. In mid-February 2008, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine withdrew the Monmouth Junction alignment from the MOM Plan. Corzine opted to endorse the two remaining alternate alignments (via Red Bank or Matawan-Freehold, the latter which is currently part of the Henry Hudson rail trail. NJ Transit is still planning to go forward with the study of all the routes as to not delay action further on the EIS, and says all three routes are still up for evaluation, although they will take the Governor&apos;s comments into consideration. In August 2010, NJ Transit received $534,375 in Federal Funds to investigate the possibilities of a MOM line. { http://newstranscript.gmnews.com/news/2010-09-01/Front_Page/Federal_dollars_to_fund_rail_study.html } [ Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania ] In November 2008, the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation (LVEDC), along with both Lehigh and Northampton counties, commissioned a study to explore the merits of expanding the Raritan Valley Line to the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, which would potentially include stops in Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton. { &quot; County eyes N.J. rail extension to area, &quot; &apos;&apos;The Morning Call&apos;&apos;, November 7, 2008. } [ West Trenton ] [ West Trenton Line (NJ Transit) ] The West Trenton Line is a proposed service connecting West Trenton Station with Newark Penn Station. The train would connect with the Raritan Valley Line at Bridgewater. As of 2004, New Jersey Transit&apos;s estimate of the cost of creating a passenger line to West Trenton was $197 million. { West Trenton Line, accessed December 21, 2006 } To date, no funding for the proposal has been secured. { http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=Project016To [Accessed April 5, 2008] } Service ran on the line prior to 1983. [ Cancelled projects ] [ Access to the Region&apos;s Core ] [ Access to the Region&apos;s Core ] NJ Transit intended to construct a new two-track Hudson River tunnel adjacent to the two existing single-track Northeast Corridor tunnels (built in the early 20th century by the Pennsylvania Railroad ). NJ Transit referred to the project as Access to the Region&apos;s Core, which would have used Dual-Power Locomotives and a newly constructed rail junction at Secaucus, allowing for a one-train ride between the Port Jervis, Main, Bergen County, Pascack Valley, and Raritan Valley lines and Penn Station New York. The project broke ground in June 2009. { GOVERNOR CORZINE MAKES CAPITAL COMMITMENT FOR NEW TRANS-HUDSON COMMUTER RAIL TUNNEL: Applauds united support from New Jersey and New York senators, press release, dated May 10, 2006 } Both the Federal Transit Administration and The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey made public commitments of $3 billion to the project. However, the project was suspended on October 7, 2010 due to concerns that the state of New Jersey would be solely responsible for the projected $5 billion in overruns. On October 27, 2010, Governor Chris Christie made a final decision to cancel the project. Amtrak later unveiled the Gateway Project, which addresses some of the issues ARC was meant to resolve.
