As such, he was the most prominent national socialist in the Netherlands before and during the Second World War. During the war, he was able to keep this position, due to the support he received from the Germans. After the war, he was convicted and executed for high treason. [ Biography ] [ Early life ] He was born in 1894 in Werkendam, in the northern part of the province of Noord-Brabant in the Netherlands. He showed from an early age talent for technical matters and he chose to study civil engineering in Delft. In the 1920s, he became active in several extreme right organizations such as the Dietsche Bond which advocated a Greater Netherlands including Flanders (Dutch-speaking Belgium ). [ Foundation of the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging ] [ Anton Adriaan Mussert Netherlands (single nationwide constituency) Netherlands May 1937 December 1942 Member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands ] On 14 December 1931, he, Cornelis van Geelkerken, and ten others founded the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB) (literally, the National Socialist Movement), a Dutch counterpart to the German National Socialists, the Nazis. In its early years, the NSB boasted that its membership included several hundred Jews, { Current Biography 1941, p620-23 } until the German party directed a more antisemitic course. A 1933 demonstration at Utrecht attracted only 600 protestors. A year later, however, the NSB rallied 25,000 demonstrators in Amsterdam. The NSB received 300,000 votes in the 1935 parliamentary elections, enough to alert the Netherlands to the Fascist threat. { Id. at 622 } In the 1937 voting, the Fascists polled a little more than half as much. Thereafter, Mussert worked toward preventing resistance to a German invasion. A state of siege was declared by the Dutch government in April 1940 after the foreign correspondent for the New York Times, Vladimir Poliakov, broke the news that Mussert&apos;s followers were preparing to kidnap Queen Wilhelmina as part of a coup. On May 10, German troops invaded the Netherlands and Mussert was permitted to suppress all political parties other than the NSB. [ Mussert&apos;s role during the war ] [ 1940 ] Mussert was not appointed prime minister of the occupied nation. Instead, Austrian Nazi Artur Seyss-Inquart was appointed as the Reichskommissar, while Berlin summoned Mussert to control his uncooperative countrymen. Mussert responded by working with the Gestapo in stopping resistance to the Nazi occupation. On 21 June 1940 Mussert agreed to have NSB members train with the SS-Standarte &apos;Westland&apos;. On 11 September, Mussert instructed Henk Feldmeijer, to organize the Nederlandsche SS (Dutch SS) as a division of the NSB. However, Mussert had nothing to do with the raising of an all-Dutch volunteer SS unit, the SS-Freiwilligen-Legion Niederlande. { Meyers, Jan; Mussert, een politiek leven, Amsterdam, 1984, ISBN 90-295-3113-4 (Dutch language) } Regardless, thousands of Dutch citizens were arrested. [ Following years ] Mussert&apos;s membership card in the NSB Hitler declared Mussert to be &quot; Führer of the Dutch People &quot; on December 13, 1942, albeit solely as an assistant to Seyss-Inquart. { &quot; Obscure Dutch Politician Named New &apos;Fuehrer&apos; for the Netherlands, &quot; Oakland Tribune, December 14, 1942, p5 } [ Death ] Upon the surrender of Germany, Mussert was arrested at the NSB office in The Hague on May 7, 1945. He was convicted of high treason on November 28 after a two day trial, and was sentenced to death on December 12 of that year. He appealed to Queen Wilhelmina for clemency. She refused. On 7 May 1946, Mussert was executed by a firing squad on the Waalsdorpervlakte, a site near The Hague where hundreds of Dutch citizens had been put to death by the Nazi regime. { &quot; Dutch Nazi Executed, &quot; Amarillo Globe, May 7, 1946, p1 } [ See also ] History of the Netherlands (1939–1945) [ References ] The Patriotic Traitors : A History of Collaboration in German-Occupied Europe, 1940-45 by David Littlejohn ISBN 0-434-42725-X Dutch Under German Occupation: 1940-1945 by Werner Warmbrunn ISBN 0-8047-0152-0 Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890 edited by Philip Rees, 1991, ISBN 0-13-089301-3 [ External links ] [ 0063448 Portret van Anton Adriaan Mussert ] Anton Mussert and the Dutch Nazi Party Anton Adriaan Mussert Flags of the NSB, a Paul Verhoeven directed 1968 TV documentary [ Mussert, Anton Dutch politician May 11, 1894 Werkendam, Netherlands May 7, 1946 The Hague, Netherlands ] Category:1894 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in the Netherlands Category:Delft University of Technology alumni Category:Dutch civil engineers Category:Dutch fascists Category:Dutch people of World War II Category:Executed Dutch Nazi collaborators Category:Executed politicians Category:History of the Netherlands Category:Leaders of political parties in the Netherlands Category:National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands politicians Category:People executed by firing squad Category:People from Werkendam Category:World War II political leaders cs:Anton Adriaan Mussert de:Anton Mussert es:Anton Mussert eo:Anton Mussert fr:Anton Mussert fy:Anton Mussert he:אנטון אדריאן מוסרט nl:Anton Mussert no:Anton Mussert pl:Anton Mussert ru:Мюссерт, Антон Адриан fi:Anton Mussert
