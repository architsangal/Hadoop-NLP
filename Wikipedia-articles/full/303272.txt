When experimentally tested, species from Australia, New Guinea and Japan were also found to be susceptible to the infection.

In 1959, to bolster dwindling stocks of native crayfish, the signal crayfish was introduced to Sweden. The signal crayfish was known to be resistant, and it was not recognised at that time that it was a carrier of the disease. After 150 years of contact, no resistance has been discovered in native European crayfish.

Transport of signal crayfish, red swamp crayfish and infected native European freshwater crayfish between waters is the main cause for contamination. Transmission of the disease through items that has been in contact with contaminated water, for example a fishing tool or footwear is also possible. The spores are also sensitive to high or low temperatures. Most authorities have local rules and regulations that the amount of water moved between different waters (in for example a boat) is minimised. It is usually also recommended to only use fishing bait from the same lake when fishing, alternatively freeze it to at least [ -10 C F ] for one day before use, if risk for contamination exists. The fungal spores of crayfish plague disappear from an infected water system (connected lakes and rivers) in a few weeks after the last infected crayfish is gone.

[ Signs ] Infection with Aphanomyces astaci is accompanied by few signs in its early stages, and the first indication of infection may be mortality.

The effects of the neurotoxin s in the oömycete can include appearing in daytime (crayfish are typically nocturnal) and a lack of co-ordination.
