(Photo: Joe Rimensberger)}} The Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun was a German single-engine sports and touring aircraft developed by Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (Bavarian Aircraft Works). The Bf 108 was of all-metal construction. The Bf 109 fighter used many of the same design features. [ such as... July 2009 ] [ Design and development ] Originally designated the M 37, the aircraft was designed as a four-seat sports/recreation aircraft for competition in the 4th &apos;&apos;Challenge de Tourisme Internationale&apos;&apos; (1934). [ Technical Memorandums No. 760 - Technical Aspects of the 1934 International Touring Competition (Rundflug) December 1934 http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930094657_1993094657.pdf R. Schulz W. Pleines PDF National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 13 March 2010 ] { Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun } The M 37 prototype flew first in spring 1934 powered by a 250  PS (247  hp, 184  kW) Hirth HM 8U inverted- V engine, which drove a three-blade propeller. Although it was outperformed by several other aircraft in the competition, the M 37&apos;s overall performance marked it as a popular choice for record flights. Particular among these traits was its extremely low fuel consumption rate, good handling, and superb takeoff and landing characteristics. One of the first major changes made to the production variants was to adapt the fuselage for a four-seat configuration. The Bf 108A first flew in 1934, followed by the Bf 108B in 1935. The Bf 108B used the Argus As 10 air-cooled inverted V8 engine. The nickname Taifun (German for &quot; typhoon &quot; ) was given to her own aircraft by Elly Beinhorn, a well known German pilot, and was generally adopted. { Smith 1971, pp. 36–37. } [ Operational history ] Soon after the first production aircraft began to roll off the assembly line in Augsburg, several Bf 108s had set endurance records. The Bf 108 was adopted into Luftwaffe service during World War II, where it was primarily used as a personnel transport and liaison aircraft. The plane involved in the Mechelen Incident was a Bf 108. Production of the Bf 108 was transferred to occupied France during World War II and production continued after the war as the Nord 1000 &apos;&apos;Pingouin&apos;&apos;. [ Variants ] { Nord Noralpha painted to represent an Me 208 } M 37/Bf 108A Initial version designed in 1934 for use in Challenge 1934. Six were built with the Hirth HM 8U, one other initially had a 220  PS (217  hp, 162  kW)Argus As17B inline engine and later a 160  PS (158  hp, 118  kW) Siemens Sh14A radial. Bf 108B Revised version, built from late 1935. Prototype had a Siemens Sh14A radial, but production machines used the 240  PS (237  hp, 177  kW) Argus 10C or the 270  PS (266  hp, 199  kW) Argus 10E. Quadrant shaped rather than rectangular rear window, tailwheel replacing skid, revision of shape of empennnage and removal of tailplane upper bracing. Bf 108C Proposed high-speed version, powered by a 400  PS (395  hp, 294  kW) Hirth HM 512 engine. Probably not built. Me 208 Improved and enlarged version with a retractable tricycle landing gear. Two prototypes were built by SNCAN (Nord) in France during the war. After 1945 Nord continued its production as the Nord Noralpha. A Nord Noralpha is on display at the Valiant Air Command Warbird Museum in Titusville, Florida, United States which has been painted to represent an Me 208. Valiant Air Command Nord 1000 &apos;&apos;Pingouin&apos;&apos; Bf 108 built during and after the war by SNCAN in France; followed by the Nord 1001, that had only minor variations and the Nord 1002 which used a Renault engine.

Royal Air Force RAF Aldon impressed four Bf 108s on the outbreak of World War II and put into service, who designated them Messerschmitt Aldon. It was the fastest light communications aircraft the RAF had then, but they were often mistaken for Bf 109s. Post-war, 15 more captured Bf 108s flew in RAF colours. [ United States 1912 ] A single Bf 108B was purchased by the U.S. Military Attaché for Air in the spring of 1939 for $14,378 and designated XC-44. It was repossessed by the Nazi government in December 1941 (after having been condemned in November).
