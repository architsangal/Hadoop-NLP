His book Soul On Ice is a collection of essays praised by The New York Times Book Review at the time of its publication as &quot; brilliant and revealing. &quot; Cleaver went on to become a prominent member of the Black Panthers, having the titles Minister of Information, and Head of the International Section of the Panthers while in exile in Cuba and Algeria. As editor of the official Panther&apos;s newspaper, Cleaver&apos;s influence on the direction of the Party was rivaled only by founders Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. Cleaver and Newton eventually fell out with each other, resulting in a split that weakened the Party. A reformed serial rapist and racist, in Soul on Ice Cleaver wrote, &quot; If a man like Malcolm X could change and repudiate racism, if I myself and other former Muslims can change, if young whites can change, then there is hope for America. &quot; [ Soul on ice Cleaver Eldridge 1968, 1991 Dell/Delta 0-385-33379-X ] {, p. 106 } Cleaver eventually turned to the right-wing, becoming an LDS Church member and a member of the Republican Party. [ Early life ] Born in Wabbaseka, Arkansas, as a child Cleaver moved with his family to Phoenix and then to Los Angeles. [ African American Lives Gates Henry Louis Higginbotham, Eveleyn B.

They had a son, Ahmad Maceo Eldridge Cleaver, and a daughter, Joju Younghi Cleaver. As a teenager he was involved in petty crime and spent time in detention centers. At the age of eighteen he was convicted of a felony drug charge and sent to the adult prison at Soledad. In 1958, he was further convicted of rape and assault with intent to murder and eventually served time in Folsom and San Quentin prisons. [ Eldridge Cleaver, Black Panther Who Became G.O.P.

[ Soul on ice Cleaver Eldridge 1968, 1991 Dell/Delta 0-385-33379-X ] In the essays, Cleaver traces his own development from a &quot; supermasculine menial &quot; to a radical black liberationist, and his essays became highly influential in the black power movement. In the most controversial part of the book, Cleaver acknowledges committing acts of rape, stating that he initially raped black women in the ghetto &quot; for practice, &quot; and then embarked on the serial rape of white women. He described these crimes as politically inspired, motivated by a genuine conviction that the rape of white women was &quot; an insurrectionary act. &quot; When he began writing Soul on Ice, he unequivocally renounced rape and all his previous reasoning about it. The essays in Soul on Ice are divided in four thematic sections: { Andrews, William L., Frances Smith. Foster, and Trudier Harris. The Oxford Companion to African American Literature. New York: Oxford UP, 1997 } &quot; Letters from Prison &quot;, describing Cleaver&apos;s experiences with and thoughts on crime and prisons; &quot; Blood of the Beast &quot;, discussing race relations and promoting black liberation ideology; &quot; Prelude to Love – Three Letters &quot;, love letters written to Cleaver&apos;s attorney, Beverly Axelrod; and &quot; White Woman, Black Man &quot;, on gender relations, black masculinity, and sexuality. [ Black Panther Party ] Eldridge Cleaver was released from prison in 1966, after which he joined the Oakland -based Black Panther Party, serving as Minister of Information, or spokesperson. What initially attracted Cleaver to the Panthers as opposed to other prominent groups was their commitment to armed struggle. [ POST-PRISON WRITINGS &amp; SPEECHES Cleaver Eldridge 1969 Vintage 978-0-394-42323-4 ] In 1967, Eldridge Cleaver, along with Marvin X, Ed Bullins and Ethna Wyatt, formed the Black House political/cultural center in San Francisco. Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Askia Toure, Sarah Webster Fabio, Art Ensemble of Chicago, Avotcja, Reginald Lockett, Emory Douglas, Samuel Napier, Bobby Hutton, Huey Newton, and Bobby Seale were Black House regulars. [ The Autobiography of Leroi Jones Baraka Amiri Baraka 1984, 1986, 1997 Lawrence Hill Books 1-55652-231-2 ] He was a Presidential candidate in 1968 on the ticket of the Peace and Freedom Party. { &apos;&apos;Former Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver Dies at 62&apos;&apos;, by Jenifer Warren, &apos;&apos;The Los Angeles Times&apos;&apos;, 5/2/98 } Cleaver was born on August 31, 1935, and therefore would not have been the requisite 35 years of age until more than a year after Inauguration Day 1969. (Although the Constitution requires that the President be 35 years of age, it does not specify if he must have reached that age at the time of nomination, or election, or inauguration.) Courts in both Hawaii and New York held that he could be excluded from the ballot because he could not possibly meet the Constitutional criteria. { Jones v.

Also in 1968, Cleaver led an ambush of Oakland police officers, during which two officers were wounded. In the aftermath of the ambush, Cleaver was wounded and seventeen-year-old Black Panther member Bobby Hutton was killed. { http://colemantruth.net/kate1.pdf } Charged with attempted murder, he jumped bail to flee to Cuba and later went to Algeria. Following Timothy Leary &apos;s Weather Underground assisted prison escape, Leary stayed with Cleaver in Algeria; however, Cleaver placed Leary under &quot; revolutionary arrest &quot; as a counter-revolutionary for promoting drug use. Cleaver later left Algeria and spent time in France. Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton eventually fell out with each other over the necessity of armed struggle as a response to COINTELPRO and other actions by the government against the Black Panthers and other radical groups. [ The COINTELPRO Papers Jim Vanderwall Ward Churchill 1990, 2002 South End Press 0-89608-648-8 ] Cleaver advocated the escalation of armed resistance into urban guerilla warfare, while Newton suggested the best way to respond to was to put down the gun, which he felt alienated the Panthers from the rest of the Black community, and focus on more pragmatic reformist activity.

With regard to the attempted murder charge stemming from the armed Panther attack on Oakland police in 1968, legal wrangling ended in Cleaver being sentenced to probation for assault. In 1980, he admitted that he had led the Panther group on a deliberate ambush of the police officers, thus provoking the shoot-out. { Kate Coleman, 1980, &quot; Souled Out: Eldridge Cleaver Admits He Ambushed Those Cops. &quot; New West Magazine. } [ Soul on Fire (1978) ] Playing on the title of Soul on Ice, Cleaver published Soul on Fire in 1978. [ Cleaver Eldridge Soul on Fire Word Books 1978 Waco, Texas ] Cleaver made several claims regarding his exile in Algeria: he claimed he was supported by regular stipends from the government of North Vietnam, which the United States was then bombing. Cleaver stated that he was followed by other former criminals turned revolutionaries, many of whom hijacked planes to get to Algeria. Apparently, the Algerians expected Cleaver to keep his proteges in line, which he described as increasingly difficult as their increasing numbers stretched his North Vietnamese allowance to the breaking point. Cleaver organized a stolen car ring, stealing cars in Europe to sell in Africa. Around this time Cleaver discovered his wife had a lover; the lover was subsequently murdered. Cleaver eventually fled Algeria out of fear for his life. He could no longer control his proteges and the Algerian police were cracking down on them. He subsequently lived underground for a time in France. Cleaver became a born again Christian during his year of isolation, while living underground. He later led a short-lived revivalist ministry called Eldridge Cleaver Crusades, &quot; a hybrid synthesis of Islam and Christianity he called &apos;Christlam&apos;. &quot; [ Later life ] In the early 1980s, Cleaver became disillusioned with what he saw as the commercial nature of mainstream evangelical Christian ity and examined alternatives, including Sun Myung Moon &apos;s campus ministry organization CARP, and Mormonism. { &quot; One Journey Home: Eldridge Cleaver&apos;s Spiritual Path &quot; by Linda Neale &apos;&apos;EarthLight Magazine&apos;&apos; #50, Spring 2004 } Cleaver was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on December 11, 1983, { Shows date of the baptism of Leroy Eldridge Cleaver, https://new.familysearch.org } { &quot; From Black Panther to Mormon: The Case of Eldridge Cleaver &quot; at Mormonmatters.org } periodically attended regular services, lectured by invitation at LDS gatherings, and was a member of the church in good standing at the time of his death in 1998. By the 1980s, Cleaver had become a conservative Republican. He appeared at various Republican events and spoke at a California Republican State Central Committee meeting regarding his political transformation. In 1984 he ran for election to the Berkeley City Council but lost.

Shortly after his final arrest, he moved to Southern California, falling into poor health. [ Death ] Eldridge Cleaver died at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center on May 1, 1998.
