Except for a five-year affiliation with the Chicago Cubs (1979–84), the Angels stayed in the Quad Cities through the 1992 season.

[ Joel Dinda Davenport, Iowa, in the Midwest League http://www.mwlguide.com/cities/davenport/index.html 2007-01-01 ] { Modern Woodmen Park in } { Davenport } The team used the nickname of its major-league parent through the 1991 season. It was known as the Quad City River Bandits from 1992 through the 2003 season. On October 20, 2003, the team was renamed the Swing of the Quad Cities; the nickname, like the previous one, was chosen as the winning entry in a &quot; name the team &quot; contest. On December 13, 2007, the team announced it would return to its earlier moniker, becoming the Quad Cities River Bandits. More than 48 percent of voters in a contest sponsored by the franchise&apos;s new owners preferred the River Bandits name over the Swing and four other finalists: the Channel Cats, the Current, the River Eagles, and the Talons.

In 1986 Chicago businessman Harry Semrow purchased the team but sold it after the 1987 season due to poor health. Richard Holtzman, another Chicago businessman who owned as many as five minor league teams, owned the franchise from 1987 until 1998. In 1998, Holtzman sold the team to Seventh Inning Stretch, a company owned by Kevin Krause, a businessman out of Mason City, Iowa, and son of Kum &amp; Go co-founder William Krause. On December 28, 2006, Krause agreed to sell the team to Florida -based Main Street Baseball for an undisclosed price; the sale was completed on November 29, 2007.
