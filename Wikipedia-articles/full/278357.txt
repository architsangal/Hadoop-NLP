Logo for the inaugural WNBA All-Star Game, held in 1999 The Women&apos;s National Basketball Association All-Star Game, commonly referred to as the WNBA All-Star Game is an annual exhibition basketball game played in the United States between the best players of the Eastern and Western Conference of the Women&apos;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). [ Structure ] Each conference is represented by a team of 12 players who are currently having the best seasons performance-wise around the league. The starters are determined by fans voting through internet ballots. The rest of the players are selected by league personnel including head coaches as well as media personalities. At the end of the game, an all-star game Most Valuable Player (MVP) is named, as decided by a panel of media members. [ History ] In 2004, the game was not played in its usual format due to the WNBA players competing in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. That year, the USA national team defeated a team of WNBA All-Stars 74-58 at Radio City Music Hall. This game is not considered to be an All-Star Game. No game was played in 2008 due to the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing, China. The 2010 game also matched Team USA against a WNBA All-Star team, with Team USA winning 99–72 at Mohegan Sun Arena. Much like the 2004 game, this year&apos;s matchup is not considered to be an All-Star Game.
