[ the mythological figure Jupiter&apos;s irregular moon Ananke (moon) ] { Plato &apos;s &apos;&apos; } { Republic &apos;&apos;. } In Greek mythology, Ananke, also spelled Anangke, Anance, or Anagke ( Ancient Greek : [ grc Ἀνάγκη ], from the common noun [ grc ἀνάγκη ], &quot; force, constraint, necessity &quot; ), was a primordial ancient Greek goddess of inevitability, the personification of destiny, necessity and fate. She appears as a serpentine being, and marks the beginning of the cosmos, along with Chronos, in the Orphic cosmogony. Together they surrounded the primal egg of solid matter and so brought about the creation of the ordered universe. The ancient representation of the goddess, is perhaps a torch-bearing figure, but she was also depicted holding a spindle, as the representation of Moira (fate). Ananke may be related with the Homeric Moira and with Tekmor, the primeval goddess of ordinance in the cosmogony of Alcman (7th century BC). It seems that she represented a universal principle of natural order, which controlled all fate and circumstance of mortals, and was far beyond the reach of the younger gods whose fates she was sometimes said to control. The Greek writers named this power Moira, or Ananke, and even the gods could not alter what was ordained. { Aeschylus, } { Prometheus Bound, 510–518 &quot; Prometheus : Not in this way is Moira (Fate), who brings all to fulfillment, destined to complete this course. Only when I have been bent by pangs and tortures infinite am I to escape my bondage. Skill is weaker by far than Ananke (Necessity). Chorus : Who then is the helmsman of Ananke (Necessity)? Prometheus : The three-shaped Moirai (Fates) and mindful Erinyes (Furies). Chorus : Can it be that Zeus has less power than they do?Prometheus : Yes, in that even he cannot escape what is foretold. Theoi Project - Ananke. } According to the ancient Greek traveller Pausanias, there was a temple in ancient Corinth where the goddesses Ananke and Bia (meaning violence or violent haste) were worshipped together in the same shrine. In Roman mythology, she was called Necessitas ( &quot; necessity &quot; ). [ Etymology ] &quot; Ananke &quot; is derived from the common Ancient Greek noun ἀνάγκη, (Ionic αναγκαίη : anankaiê ) meaning force, constraint or necessity. Homer uses the word meaning necessity ( αναγκαίη πολεμίζειν, &quot; ιt is necessary to fight &quot; ) or force ( εξ’ ανάγκης, &quot; by force &quot; ). { Iliad 4.300, } { Oddysey 4.557 : Lidell, Scott: &apos;&apos; A Greek English Lexicon&apos;&apos; ανάγκη } In Ancient Greek literature the word is also used meaning fate or destiny, ( ανάγκη δαιμόνων, &quot; fate by the daemon s or by the gods &quot; ), and by extension compulsion or torture by a superior. { E.Ph.1000, } { Xenophon Hiero 9.4 } The word is often personified in poetry, as Simonides does: &quot; Even the gods don’t fight against ananke &quot;. { Simonides Fr. 4.20 Diehl : C.M.Bowra, The Greek experience.W.P Publishing company, Cleveland and New York p.61 } In the philosophical sense it means necessity, logical necessity, { Aristotle, Metaph.1026.b28, 1064.b33 : Lidell, Scott: &apos;&apos; A Greek English Lexicon&apos;&apos; ανάγκη } or laws of nature { Xenophon, Memorabilia 1.11.1 : Lidell, Scott: &apos;&apos; A Greek English Lexicon&apos;&apos; ανάγκη } [ Mythical cosmogonies ] { Jacob Bryant&apos;s } { Orphic Egg (1774) } In the cosmogony of Alcman first came Thetis (Disposer, Creation), and then simultaneously Poros (path) and Tekmor ( end post, ordinance). { τέκμωρ ( Τekmor) : fixed mark or boundary, end post, purpose τέκμαρ, } { Old English: Takn, sign, mark, English : token, sign, omen. Compare Sanskrit, } { Laksmi. token, Online Etymology Dictionary } Poros is related with the beginning of all things, and Tekmor is related with the end of all things. { Alcman, frag 5, (from Scholia), Transl Cambell, Vol Greek Lyric II : Theoi Project - Ananke. } Later in the Orphic cosmogony, first came Thesis (Disposer), whose ineflable nature is unexpressed. Ananke is the primeval goddess of inevitability, and she is entwined in the serpentine coils of her mate, the time-god Chronos, at the very beginning of time. They represent the everlasting cosmic-forces of fate and time. Together they surround the primal egg of solid matter ( Orphic egg ) in their constricting coils and split it into its constituent parts (earth, heaven and sea) and so they bring about the creation of the ordered universe. { Orphica. Theogonies frag 54 (from Damascius). Greek hymns C3rd, C2nd cent. BC Theoi Project - Ananke. } These ideas were the basis of the cosmogony of Empedocles (5th century BC). Strife ( Neikos ) separated the four elements from the initial sphere, until Love ( Philia ) appeared and balanced everything. Strife and Love are fighting against each other in a cosmic ever-recurring process, and stern Ananke keeps the immemorial order. { Frag. B57, (Simplicius, On the Heavens, 586) } { Empedocles, Fragments (Greek philosopher C5th B.C.) : &quot; There is a law of stern Ananke (Necessity), the immemorial ordinance of the gods made fast for ever, bravely sworn and sealed: should any Daimon (Spirit or God), born to enduring life, be fouled with sin of slaughter, or transgress by disputation, perjured and forsworn, three times ten thousand years that soul shall wander an outcast from Felicity, condemned to mortal being, and in diverse shapes with interchange of hardship go his ways.” Theoi Project - Ananke. } A cosmic egg is a mythological motif found in the creation myth s of many culture s and civilization s.

Mundane Egg (The) Bartleby.com 2011-02-01 ] The earliest ideas of &quot; Egg-shaped Cosmos &quot; seem to come from some of the Sanskrit scriptures ( Brahmanda ). The Rig Veda uses the term Hiranyagarbha, (literally &quot; golden fetus &quot; or &quot; golden womb &quot; ), which floats around in emptiness for a while, and then breaks into two halves which formed heaven ( Dyaus, in Greek Zeus ) and earth { Rig Veda 10.121 } [ Origins ] Ananke seems to have similar functions with the Homer ic Moira ( fate ) and with Tekmor ( proof, ordinance) a primeval goddess in the cosmogony of Alcman (7 th century BC) who were both related with the limit and end of life. { &quot; Not yet is thy fate (moira) to die and meet thy doom &quot; ( } { Iliad 7.52), &quot; But thereafter he (Achilleus) shall suffer whatever Fate (Aisa) spun for him at his birth, when his mother bore him &quot; : ( } { Iliad 20.128 ): } { M. Nilsson. (1967). Die Geschichte der Griechissche Religion, Vol I C.F.Beck Verlag., Műnchen pp 363,364 } In the Homeric poems Zeus appears as the guider of destiny, but his decisions are controlled by this abstract power ( Moira). { M.Nilsson (1967). Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, Vol I. C.F.Beck Verlag. Munchen. p.361-368 } In the Theogony of Hesiod (7 th century BC) the three Moirai (Fates) are acting over the gods. { Hesiod, } { Theogony 221–225. &quot; Also Night ( } { Nyx ) bare the destinies ( } { Moirai ), and ruthless avenging Fates ( } { Keres ), who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and gods... until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty. &quot; } { online &apos;&apos;The Theogony of Hesiod. Transl. Hugh Evelyn White&apos;&apos; (1914) 221–225. } In Plato &apos;s Republic (4th century BC) the Three Fates are daughters of Ananke. { Plato, Republic 617c (trans. Shorey) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) : Theoi Project - Ananke. } When the Greeks moved away from the belief that gods resemble men, they tried to find a single principle behind the various gods, and even to define it as what is essentially divine. The Pythagoreans (6 th century BC) advanced to an idea of divine omnipotence, { Iamblich, Pyth., &quot; It is not that the case that for the gods some things are possible and some impossible, but all things are possible. &quot; : C.M.Bowra (1957) The Greek experience, World Publishing Company, Cleveland and New York. p.p 60,61 } and some others sought to find something else behind the gods which was more powerful than they. They might call this power Ananke or Moira. { Suidas s.v. Anankei (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D. In the Epigrams : &quot; See how all-wise Ananke (Necessity) taught him to find an escape from Hades.And a proverb: &apos;The gods do not fight against Ananke (Necessity).&apos; It recommends that one should be satisfied with what is available. &quot; Theoi Project - Ananke. } In either case there was a feeling towards a notion of order, to which even the gods had to conform, and a desire to bring the gods under the same rule which was applied to men The concept of a universal principle of natural order has been compared with similar concepts in other cultures like the Vedic Rta, the Avesta n Asha ( Arta ) and the Egyptian Maat. Rta and Arta originally meant &quot; properly joined &quot; and manifested those features of nature which either remain constant or occur on regular bases. In human sphere the words were related with morality meaning &quot; truth &quot; or &quot; righteousness &quot;. { &quot; The concept of Ṛta originally arose in the Indo-Aryan period from a consideration of the natural order of the world and of the occurrences taking place within it as doing so with a kind of causal necessity. In the context of Vedic religion, those features of nature which either remain constant or which occur on a regular basis were seen to be a manifestation of the power of Ṛta in the physical cosmos &quot; : } { Hermann Oldenberg (1894). Die Religion des Veda, Verlag Wilhelm von Herz, Berlin pp. 195-196 } and the Egyptian goddess Maat had similar functions. { Gods and Myths of Ancient Egypt, Robert A. Armour, American Univ in Cairo Press, p167, 2001, ISBN 977-424-669-1 } Recurring events like the transmigration of the souls related with morality, appear in the Pythagorean and Orphic beliefs, in some poems of Pindar, { Pindar, Fr.133, Bergk :Persephone and the wandering of the souls : } { M.Nilsson (1967). Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, Vol I. C.F.Beck Verlag. Munchen. p.691, 692 } and especially in the work of Empedocles ( 5 th century BC), who represents Ananke as the immemorial ordinance of men and gods. However in the official Greek religion Ananke represents the universal principle of &quot; necessity &quot; and is not usually related with any &quot; moral purpose &quot;, or &quot; recurring events &quot;. { Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 430 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.) : &quot; Men serve no harsher mistress than Ananke (Necessity), who drives me now and forced me to come here at another king’s behest. &quot; Theoi Project - Ananke. } [ Mythology ] In the Orphic cosmogony originally there was the unexpressed Thesis ( tithimi, τίθημι: put or join together). Chronos ( unaging time) was engendered by the first two principles ( water and mud) and he was represented as a dragon (serpent) with extra heads growing upon him. He was united with Ananke ( or Adrasteia, inescapable) who had the same serpentine nature, and they produced the cosmic egg which had the dyad of thetwo natures (male and female) inside it. The theology of the Orphic rhapsodiesbegins with the first-born (Protogonos) bisexual god Phanes (phainomai, φαίνομαι: &quot; to appear &quot; ) who is also called Zeus, the order of all, and of the whole world. The one before the two Thesis, however, he leaves unexpressed, his very silence being an intimation of its ineffable nature. The third principle after the two was engendered by these -- Ge (mud) and Hydros (Water), that is -- and was a Serpent (Drakon) with extra heads growing upon it of a bull and a lion, and a god’s countenance in the middle; it had wings upon its shoulders, and its name was Khronos (Unaging Time) and also Herakles. United with it was Ananke (Inevitability, Compulsion), being of the same nature, or Adrasteia, incorporeal, her arms extended throughout the universe and touching its extremities. Orpheus says, Khronos (Time) generated an egg and it is from these that &quot; Protogonos-Phanes &quot; was produced. What is this triad, then? The egg; the dyad of the two natures inside it (male and female), and the plurality of the various seeds between; and thirdly an incorporeal god with golden wings on his shoulders. And the third god of the triad this theology too celebrates as Protogonos (First-Born) Phanes, and it calls him Zeus the order of all and of the whole world, wherefore he is also called Pan ( παν :all). The altenative names of Ananke are Adrasteia and Tekmor. { Theoi Project - Ananke. } [ Ancient Greek literature ] In Ancient Greek literature, Ananke represents necessity and is not usually related with any &quot; moral purpose &quot;. Homer uses the word Moira which is later personified indicating the destiny, but it seems that originally the word included the &quot; ascertainment &quot; or &quot; proof &quot;. &quot; According to fate &quot; meant &quot; rightly, in order &quot;. This universal principle of natural order might be called Moira which according to Herodotus a god cannot escape, { Herodotus, Histories I 91: C.M.Bowra (1957) The Greek experience p.p 60,61 } or Ananke as Simonides does, saying that even the gods don’t fight against it. This proverb is also mentioned in Suidas. Aeschylus in Prometheus Bound combines Moirai and Ananke in a scheme, when he makes Prometheus say that Zeus cannot change what is ordained, which is itself the work of the Fates and Furies according to necessity. Sophocles believed that the gods send to all men their destiny. Tyche (fortune) was originally a power of destiny too, and then she describes the change of human lack. Sophocles is referring to &quot; necessary change, or destiny &quot; ( anankea tyche&apos; ). { Ai. 485, also Antig.V 1158 : Nilsson Vol I, pp. 756-757 } In a passage god (theos) tyche and daemon have similar meanings. { &apos;&apos;Gods, tyche and daemon &quot;. : Nilsson Vol I, pp. 756,757 } In the tragedies of Euripides the change between happiness and mishappiness is very important. Ananke and tyche mean a simple &quot; ascertainment &quot;. { Nilsson Vol I, pp. 773,774 } The gods are by the fate, but in Alcestis he says that nothing is stronger than Ananke, nor there is any cure for it. { Euripides, Alcestis 962 ff (trans. Vellacott) (Greek tragedy C5th B.C.): Theoi Project - Ananke. } In Iphigenia in Aulis, moira and tyche have similar meanings: &quot; You mistress moira and tyche, my daemon &quot;. { Iph.Avl. V 1136 : Nilsson Vol I, p. 774 } Pindar believed that destiny comes from the gods, and kept the old belief that none could escape from the destiny. He is appealing for a friendship to the Moirai and to Soteira Tyche (savior). { Nilsson Vol I, pp.748,749 } When he needed to justify the deeds of some heroes in the myth s, his ideas were well fitted in the aristocratic society: &quot; A law exists, the king of all, of mortals and immortals, which justifies the most violent action, by a superior hand &quot;. { Fr. 169. &quot; Nomos and Physis &quot;, (Law and Nature): &quot; There is an evident universal law, which with the inherited aristocratic excellence, imposes the superior against the inferior, and gains the success &quot;. : Nilsson Vol. I, p. 749 } He came to the conclusion that &quot; With Ananke everything is good &quot;. { Fr.260, Nemean V, 20ff :Nilsson p. 749 } In a story of Herodotus, Ananke has a similar meaning representing the compulsion by a superior. When the Athenians asked the people of Andros to give them money for their protection, because they had come with the aid of two gods, Peitho ( Persuation ) and Ananke, they replied that the power of Athens could never be stronger than the goddess Penia (Poverty) who expressed their inability to pay. { Herodotus Histories 8. 111. 1 (trans. Godley) (Greek historian C5th B.C.). Theoi Project - Ananke. } When the social structure was shaken by the corruption of war, divine power was quoted by men as a precedent for their own behaviour, which might be turned to a disastrous end. When the citizents of Melos invoked the gods against the unjust oppression of the Athenians, the Athenians answered that was a &quot; necessary law of nature &quot; for them to rule wherever they could. { Thucydides, V 105.1, Transl. R.Warner : &quot; Our opinion of the gods, and a knowledge of the principles which govern their own conduct, lead us to conclude that is a general necessary law of nature for us to rule wherever we can. &quot; : C.M.Bowra (1957), The Greek experience, World Publishing Company, Cleveland and New York p.62 } In Plato ’ s Republic, the three Moirai are daughters of Ananke. { Plato, Republic 617c (trans. Shorey) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) Theoi Project - Ananke. } In the Symposium he is clearly influenced by the ideas of Empedocles. Ananke represents Strife, who rules the world until Eros (Love) comes and balances everything. { &quot; Though aforetime, as I began by saying, there were many strange doings among the gods, as legend tells, because of the dominion of Ananke (Necessity). But since this god arose, ( Love) the loving of beautiful things has brought all kinds of benefits both to gods and to men. &quot; } { Plato Symposium 197b (trans. Lamb) : Theoi Project - Ananke. } [ Modern literature ] The word &quot; Ananke &quot; is featured in Victor Hugo &apos;s novel Notre-Dame de Paris, written upon a wall of Notre-Dame by the hand of Dom Claude Frollo. In his Toute La Lyre, Hugo also mentions Ananke as a symbol of love. &quot; Ananke &quot; is the title of a science fiction short story by Stanislav Lem, in the series of the Tales of Pirx the Pilot. Ananke is the key to the solution of a disastrous spaceship accident. Ananke is used in the meaning of force and obsession. Norbert Wiener, in his book Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, presents Ananke as the personification of scientific determinism, contrasted with Tyche as the personification of quantum indeterminacy, in the often-quoted sentence: &quot; The chance of the quantum theoretician is not the ethical freedom of the Augustinian, and Tyche is as relentless a mistress as Ananke. &quot; In Kelly McCullough&apos;s &quot; Ravirn &quot; series, Ananke is a prominent figure in all the books under the guise of Necessity. [ See also ] [ Ananke ] Mother Goddess There is a reference to Ananke early in John Banville&apos;s novel THE INFINITIES (Picador, London: 2009). In explaining how the gods fashioned humans so that they would procreate, the narrator [Hermes] says that the gods gave humans lust, &quot; --Eros and Ananke working hand in hand-- &quot;.
