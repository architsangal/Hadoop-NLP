[ Alexander Graham Bell and Sumner Tainter&apos;s optical phone sound-on-film technology RCA Photophone ] A Photophone receiver and headset, one half of Bell and Tainter&apos;s optical telecommunication system of 1880 The photophone (also known as a radiophone) is a telecommunications device which allowed for the transmission of both articulated sound s and normal human conversations on a beam of light. It was invented jointly by Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter on February 19, 1880, at Bell&apos;s 1325 &apos;L&apos; Street laboratory in Washington, D.C. { Bruce 1990, pg. 336 } { Jones, Newell.

On April 1, 1880, Bell&apos;s assistant transmitted the world&apos;s first wireless telephone message to him from the roof of the Franklin School to the window of Bell&apos;s laboratory, some [ 213 m ft -2 ] away. { Bruce 1990, pg.338 } { Carson 2007, pg.76-78 } { Groth, Mike. Photophones Revisted, &apos;Amateur Radio&apos; magazine, Wireless Institute of Australia, Melbourne, April 1987 pps 12 - 17; and May 1987 pps 13 - 17. } Bell believed the Photophone was his most important invention. Of the eighteen patent s granted in Bell&apos;s name alone, and the twelve he shared with his collaborators, four were for the Photophone, which Bell referred to as his &apos;greatest achievement&apos;, writing that the Photophone was &quot; the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone &quot;. { Phillipson, Donald J.C., and Neilson, Laura Bell, Alexander Graham, The Canadian Encyclopedia online. Retrieved 2009-08-06 } The device was a precursor to fiber-optic communication s that came into widespread use during the 1980s. [ April 2012 ] [ Design ] Illustration of a Photophone transmitter, showing the path of reflected sunlight, before and after being modulated Bell and Tainter&apos;s invention was based on the discovery of photovoltaic properties of certain materials by A. E. Becquerel in 1839. The Photophone used crystalline selenium cells at the focal point of its parabolic receiver. This material&apos;s electrical resistance varies inversely with the illumination falling upon it, i.e., its resistance is higher when it is in the dark, and lower when it is exposed to light. The idea of the Photophone was thus to modulate a light beam: the resulting varying illumination of the receiver would induce a corresponding varying resistance in the selenium cells, which was then used to regenerate the sounds captured by the telephone receiver. The modulation of the transmitted light beam was done by a mirror made to vibrate by a person&apos;s voice: the thin mirror would alternate between concave and convex forms, thus focusing or dispersing the light from the light source. The Photophone functioned similarly to the telephone, except that the Photophone used modulated light as a means of transmitting information, while the telephone relied on a modulated electrical signal carried over a conductive wire circuit. Bell described it in his writings: { Clark, J. An Introduction to Communications with Optical Carriers, IEEE Students&apos; Quarterly Journal, June 1966, Vol.36, Iss.144, pp. 218-222, ISSN: 0039-2871, } [ 10.1049/sqj.1966.0040 ] {. Retrieved from IEEExplore website August 19, 2011. } [ We have found that the simplest form of apparatus for producing the effect (transmitter/modulator) consists of a plane of mirror of flexible material against the back of which the speaker&apos;s voice is directed. Under the action of the voice the mirror becomes alternately convex and concave and thus alternately scatters and condenses the light. ] [ History ] A diagram from one of Bell&apos;s 1880 papers Bell transferred the Photophone&apos;s rights to the American Bell Telephone Company in May 1880. { Bruce 1990, pg.339 } The master patent for the Photophone ( [ 235199 ] Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone), was issued in December 1880, many decades before its principles could be applied to practical applications. [ Demonstration ] Illustration of a Photophone receiver, depicting the conversion of modulated light to sound, as well as its electrical power source (P) In their Washington, D.C experiment, Bell and Tainter succeeded in communicating clearly over a distance of some 213 meters (about 700  ft.), using plain sunlight as their light source, practical electrical lighting having only just been invented by Edison. Tainter, who was on the roof of the Franklin School, spoke to Bell, who was in his laboratory listening and who signaled back to Tainter by waving his hat from the window as had been requested. The receiver was a parabolic mirror with selenium cells at its focal point. Conducted from the roof of the Franklin School to Bell&apos;s laboratory at 1325 &apos;L&apos; Street, this was the world&apos;s first wireless telephone communication (away from their laboratory), thus making the Photophone the world&apos;s earliest known radiophone and wireless telephone systems. The selenium cells in the parabolic receiver had an electrical resistance varying between 100 and 300   Ω (ohms). [ Reception and adoption ] The telephone itself was still something of a novelty, and radio was decades away from commercialization. The social reticence to the Photophone&apos;s futuristic form of communications was palpable, as could be discerned in an 1880 New York Times commentary: { Editorial, } { The New York Times, August 30, 1880 } { International Fiber Optics &amp; Communication, June 1986, p. 29 } [ The ordinary man... will find a little difficulty in comprehending how sunbeams are to be used. Does Prof. Bell intend to connect Boston and Cambridge... with a line of sunbeams hung on telegraph posts, and, if so, what diameter are the sunbeams to be....[and] will it be necessary to insulate them against the weather... until (the public) sees a man going through the streets with a coil of No. 12 sunbeams on his shoulder, and suspending them from pole to pole, there will be a general feeling that there is something about Professor Bell&apos;s photophone which places a tremendous strain on human credulity. ] However at the time of their February 1880 breakthrough, Bell was immensely proud of the achievement, to the point that he wanted to name his new second daughter &quot; Photophone &quot;, which was subtly discouraged by his wife Mabel Bell (they instead chose Marian, with Daisy as her moniker). { Carson 2007, pg.77 } He wrote somewhat ecstatically: { Bruce 1990, pg.337 } [ I have heard articulate speech by sunlight! I have heard a ray of the sun laugh and cough and sing!...I have been able to hear a shadow and I have even perceived by ear the passage of a cloud across the sun&apos;s disk. You are the grandfather of the Photophone and I want to share my delight at my success. Alexander Graham Bell in a letter to his father Alexander Melville Bell, dated February 26, 1880 ] While Bell had hoped his new Photophone could be used by ships at sea and to also displace the plethora of telephone lines that were blooming along busy city boulevards, his design failed to protect its transmissions from outdoor interferences such as clouds, fog, rain, snow and such, that could easily disrupt the transmission of light. { Carson 2007, pp.77-78 } Factors such as the weather and the lack of light inhibited the use of Bell&apos;s invention. { Carson 2007, pg.78 } Not long after its invention laboratories within the Bell System continued to improve the Photophone in the hope that it could supplement or replace expensive conventional telephone line s. Its earliest non-experimental use came with military communication systems during World War II, its key advantage being that its light-based transmissions could not be intercepted by the enemy. Bell later also speculated on the Photophone&apos;s possible future applications, writing prior to any perception of the laser, and which also vaguely foretold fiber-optic telecommunications : [ Can Imagination picture what the future of this invention is to be!.... We may talk by light to any visible distance without any conduction wire.... In general science, discoveries will be make by the Photophone that are undreamed of just now. ] He also pondered its possible scientific use in the spectral analysis of artificial light sources, star s and sunspot s. [ Legacy ] A plaque marker on the side of the Franklin School in Washington, D.C. which marks one of the sites where the Photophone was demonstrated In 1947 on the centenary of Bell&apos;s birth, the Telephone Pioneers of America dedicated a historical marker on the side of one of the buildings, the Franklin School, that Bell and Tainter used for their successful trial, which was also the world&apos;s first wireless telecommunication.
