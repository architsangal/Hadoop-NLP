[ 12.2 mi km 1 ] { SE } { 240px } { Pinner High Street } { Eastcote } Pinner is a suburb in the London Borough of Harrow in London, England, 12.2 miles north west of Charing Cross. [ History ] Pinner was originally a hamlet, first recorded in 1231 as Pinnora, { Clarke, A History of Pinner, p.11 } although the already archaic -ora (meaning &apos;hill&apos;) suggests its origins lie no later than c.900. { Clarke, A History of Pinner, p.1 } The area was in the county of Middlesex until 1965, when it was absorbed by the London Government Act 1963 into Greater London. The oldest part of the village lies around the fourteenth-century parish church of St John the Baptist, { Clarke, A History of Pinner, p.34. The church was originally a chapel of ease to St Mary&apos;s Church in Harrow, and was first mentioned in 1234. It was rebuilt in the early fourteenth-century, and rededicated in 1321. The parish became independent of St Mary&apos;s in 1766, when the first perpetual curate was appointed; not until the Wilberforce Act of 1868 did it appoint its first vicar, one William Hind. } at the junction of the present day Grange Gardens, The High Street and Church Lane. The earliest surviving private dwelling, East End Farm Cottage, dates from the late fifteenth-century. { Clarke, A History of Pinner, p.18 } The village expanded rapidly between 1923 and 1939 when a series of garden estates – encouraged by the Metropolitan Railway – grew around its historic core, { Clarke, A History of Pinner, pp.176-184 } and it was largely from this time onwards that the area (including Hatch End, which forms the northeastern part of Pinner) assumed much of its present-day suburban character. The area is now continuous with neighbouring suburban districts including Rayners Lane and Eastcote. Pinner contains a large amount of homes built in the 1930s Art Deco style, the most grand of which is the Grade II listed Elm Park Court at the junction of West End Lane and Elm Park Road. Pinner has had an annual street fair since 1336, when it was granted by Royal Charter by Edward III { Clarke, A History of Pinner, p.25 }; it remains popular today. The majority of the older houses in Pinner were built by the Ellement family who were the local company of builders and joiners, with a road in Pinner still named after that family.
