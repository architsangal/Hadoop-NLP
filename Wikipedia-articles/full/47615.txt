[ Rook (disambiguation) ] { Staunton design } A rook ( [ ♖ ] [ ♜ ] borrowed from Persian رخ rokh, Sanskrit रथ rath, &quot; chariot &quot; ) is a piece in the strategy board game of chess. Formerly the piece was called the castle, tower, marquess, rector, and comes [ Sunnucks 1970 ]. The informal term &quot; castle &quot; is deprecated. { Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed.

Rothenberg, and Chess Fundamentals by } { José Capablanca (2006 revision by } { Nick de Firmian ) also only mention &quot; rook &quot;. } Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each of the corner squares on his own side of the board. [ Initial placement and movement ] [ secright ] In algebraic notation, the white rooks start on squares a1 and h1, while the black rooks start on a8 and h8. The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares (see diagram). As with captures by other pieces, the rook captures by occupying the square on which the enemy piece sits. The rook also participates, with the king, in a special move called castling.

The Persian word rukh means chariot [ Davidson 1949 10 ], and the corresponding pieces in Oriental chess games such as xiangqi and shogi have names also meaning chariot (車). { 現代漢語詞典 ISBN 978-962-07-0211-2 } Persian war chariots were heavily armoured, carrying a driver and at least one ranged-weapon bearer, such as an archer. The sides of the chariot were built to resemble fortified stone work, giving the impression of small, mobile buildings, causing terror on the battlefield. However, in the West the rook is almost universally represented as a crenellated turret. (One possible explanation is that when the game was imported to Italy, the Persian rukh became the Italian word rocca, meaning fortress. Another possible explanation is that rooks represent siege tower s – the piece is called &quot; torre &quot;, meaning tower, in Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish; &quot; tour &quot; in French; &quot; toren &quot; in Dutch; and &quot; Turm &quot; in German. Finally, the chariot was sometimes represented as a silhouette, a square with two points above representing the horse&apos;s heads, which may have been seen to resemble a building with arrowports to the medieval imagination. ) Rooks usually are similar in appearance to small castles, and as a result a rook is sometimes called a &quot; castle &quot; [ Hooper Whyld 1992 ]. This usage was common in the past ( &quot; The Rook, or Castle, is next in power to the Queen &quot; – Howard Staunton, 1847) but today it is rarely if ever used in chess literature or among players, except in the expression &quot; castling &quot;. [ Lasker 1947 8 ] { : &quot; The name &quot; Castle &quot; is rarely if ever used in modern chess literature for this piece. &quot; } [ Horton 1959 175 ] { : &quot; Sometimes the Rook has been called a &quot; Castle &quot; but in modern chess literature this term is rarely, if ever, used. &quot; } The Russian name for the rook (ladya) means a ship or boat. [ Strategy ] [ Relative value ] In general, rooks are stronger than bishops or knights (which are called minor piece s ) and are considered greater in value than either of those pieces by nearly two pawns but less valuable than two minor pieces. Two rooks are generally considered to be worth slightly more than a queen (see chess piece relative value ). Winning a rook for a bishop or knight is referred to as winning the exchange. Rooks and queens are called heavy pieces or &apos;&apos;major pieces&apos;&apos;, as opposed to bishops and knights, the minor pieces. [ Placement ] In the opening, the rooks are blocked in by other pieces and cannot immediately participate in the game; so it is usually desirable to connect one&apos;s rooks on the first rank by clearing all pieces except the king and rooks from the first rank and then castling. In that position, the rooks support each other, and can more easily move to occupy and control the most favorable files. [ tright Polugaevsky vs. Evans, 1970 kd pd rl pd pd pd pl pd rd pl kl pl pl White to move, draws ] A common strategic goal is to place a rook on the first rank of an open file (i.e. one unobstructed by pawns of either player), or a half-open file (i.e., one unobstructed by friendly pawns). From this position, the rook is relatively unexposed to risk but can exert control on every square on the file. If one file is particularly important, a player might advance one rook on it, then position the other rook behind – doubling the rooks. A rook on the seventh rank (the opponent&apos;s second rank) is typically very powerful, as it threatens the opponent&apos;s unadvanced pawns and hems in the enemy king. A rook on the seventh rank is often considered sufficient compensation for a pawn [ Fine Benko 2003 586 ]. In the diagrammed position from a game between Lev Polugaevsky and Larry Evans, { Polugaevsky vs. Evans } the rook on the seventh rank enables White to draw, despite being a pawn down [ Griffiths 1992 102–3 ]. Two rooks on the seventh rank are often enough to force victory, or at least a draw by perpetual check. { The two rooks are sometimes colloquially referred to as &quot; pigs on the seventh &quot;, because they often threaten to &quot; eat &quot; the opponent&apos;s pieces or pawns. } [ Endgame ] Rooks are most powerful towards the end of a game (i.e., the endgame ), when they can move unobstructed by pawns and control large numbers of squares. They are somewhat clumsy at restraining enemy pawns from advancing towards promotion, unless they can occupy the file behind the advancing pawn. By the same token, a rook best supports a friendly pawn towards promotion from behind it on the same file (see Tarrasch rule ). In a position with a rook and one or two minor piece s versus two rooks, generally in addition to pawns, and possibly other pieces – Lev Alburt advises that the player with the single rook should avoid exchanging the rook for one of his opponent&apos;s rooks [ Alburt 2009 44 ]. The rook is a very powerful piece to deliver checkmate. Below are a few examples of rook checkmates that are easy to force. [ tleft rl kd rl kl A two-rook checkmate ] [ tleft rl kd kl A king and rook mate. The king and rook work together to force the enemy king to the edge of the board, where it can be checkmated. ] [ tleft kd pd pd pd rl pl pl pl rd kl A back rank checkmate ] [ Symbology ] right In heraldry, chess rooks are often used as charges. Unlike a real chess rook, they are conventionally shown with two outward-curving horns. This is because they would otherwise appear to be castle towers, since there is no proportion on a coat of arms. This charge is always blazoned &quot; chess rook &quot; so as not to be confused with the bird of that name; it is also not to be confused with the zule, a similar-looking object with two outward-curving horns at both top and bottom. In Canadian heraldry, the chess rook is the brisure of the fifth daughter.
