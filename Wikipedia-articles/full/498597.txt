Sawed-off shotguns are subject to various legal restrictions depending upon jurisdiction. Not always a tool of criminals, such firearms have been and are still in use by military forces and police agencies worldwide. [ Description ] Compared to a standard shotgun, the sawed-off shotgun has a shorter effective range, due to a lower muzzle velocity and wider spread of shot. Its reduced size makes it easier to maneuver and conceal. Powerful and compact, the weapon is especially suitable for use in small spaces. For example, military vehicle crews, and entry teams running through doorways (see entry shotgun ) often use them. To make shotguns less concealable, many jurisdictions have a minimum legal length for shotgun barrels. Most gun makers in the U.S. have not offered sawed-off shotguns to the public since the early 1900&apos;s when shotguns with barrel lengths of under 18 &quot; were restricted, although they had been offered prior to that time without being illegally modified. Currently, aftermarket companies and Special Occupational Taxpayers exist that legally convert most name brand shotguns into such weapons, upon payment of either a $200.00 or $5.00 Federal fee for transferring ownership. [ The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record Evaluation and Inspections Report I-2007-006 United States Department of Justice June 2007 http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/ATF/e0706/back.htm#11 10 September 2008 ] However, a sawed-off shotgun is often an unofficial modification of a standard shotgun. In countries where handgun s are more costly or difficult to obtain, criminals might convert legally purchased or stolen shotguns into concealable weapons. For criminal organizations, the availability of standard hunting ammunition is another advantage of sawed-off shotguns. However, this practice is not limited to localities where handguns are difficult to obtain. Sawed-off shotguns might be made for a number of reasons, such as the reputation they have gained through portrayal in action movies and news reports of crime incidents. The term most genuinely applies to illegal weapons that are created by cutting off the barrel of a standard shotgun. This has a dramatic effect on double-barreled or single-shot shotguns because the barrel can be cut to any length. Pump-action or semi-automatic shotguns have a tube magazine attached to the underside of the barrel which limits the minimum barrel length to slightly longer the length of the magazine tube, when only the barrel is modified. Although the magazine can be shortened, with a corresponding loss in magazine capacity, such a modification tends to be much more technically complex, often involving large diameter square threading, and welding or silver soldering, at a bare minimum. Repeating-fire shotguns with box magazine s do not lose shell capacity when sawed off, but they are far less common than those with tubular magazines. Shotguns manufactured with barrels under the legal minimum length frequently fall into special categories. [ Legal restrictions ] Many nations have placed legal restrictions on sawed-off shotguns. The following are the restrictions for specific nations. [ Australia ] A shotgun may not have its barrel shortened so as to change the category that shotgun would be classified under. Any alteration to the length of the barrel requires permission from the Chief Commissioner of Police in each state. { Firearms Act 1996, Victoria, Australia Accessed March 4, 2009 } [ Brazil ] [ December 2011 ] 12-gauge shotguns with barrel lengths shorter than 24 inches (609 millimeters), are classified as weapons restricted to military and law enforcement only. Shotguns with smaller gauges do not have barrel length restrictions, even for single-shot or double-barrel pistols. Barrels for 28, 32, or.410 gauge shotguns may be of any length if they are original from the factory. [ Canada ] Short-barreled, manually operated shotguns (non-semi-automatics) are non-restricted as long as the barrel remains unmodified from the original factory length. There is no legal minimum for shotgun barrels as long as they are not handguns, and so shotguns with barrels as short as 8.5 inches are available in Canada. { Dominion Arms Grizzly 8.5 &quot; 12 gauge shotgun; retrieved from canadaammo.com } { Remington 870 Shorty 8.5 &quot; 12 gauge shotgun; retrieved from dlaskarms.com } Despite this, the act of reducing the barrel of a shotgun with a greater than 470 mm (18.5 inch) barrel below this length by sawing, cutting, or &quot; otherwise &quot; (by anyone other than a recognized gun manufacturer) is prohibited. { &quot; The Lupara or Short Barreled Shotgun &quot;; retrieved from nfa.ca } [ United Kingdom ] A shotgun cut down so that the barrel is shorter than [ 30 cm in ] or the overall length is less than [ 60 cm in ] is deemed to be a &quot; short-barrelled &quot; shotgun and is prohibited.

Short-barreled muzzleloading blackpowder shotguns, in contrast, are not illegal by federal law and require no tax-stamped permit, although they may be illegal under state law. As with all NFA regulated firearms, a new tax stamp must be purchased before every transfer. Inter-state transfers must be facilitated through a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) while intrastate transfers may be between two persons. { &quot; Transfers of NFA Firearms &quot;; &quot; ATF National Firearms Act Handbook &quot; } In the US, shotguns originally manufactured without shoulder stocks, having their barrels shortened to under 18 inches, are classified as an &quot; Any Other Weapon &quot; by the BATFE and have a $5 transfer tax, if they are manufactured by a maker possessing the appropriate Class 2 Special Occupational Taxpayer Federal Firearms License. However, in order to convert an existing shoulder-stocked shotgun to a short-barreled shotgun or an existing pistol-grip-only shotgun to an &quot; Any Other Weapon &quot;, a private citizen must pay the standard $200 NFA tax. [ US Code 26 26 U.S.C. 5845 1973 http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00005845----000-.html ] The sawed-off law was the law used against Randy Weaver, in the case that lead to the Ruby Ridge tragedy. ATF informant Kenneth Fadeley posed as a gun runner and interacted with Weaver over a period of years. Weaver eventually agreed to sell Fadeley a sawed-off shotgun, saying, &quot; Just tell me what... size [shotgun] and I&apos;ll supply what you want &quot;. Fadeley then showed him where to make the cut. Weaver cut the gun, &quot; [s]itting under a shade tree with a vise and a hacksaw &quot;. Federal agents threatened to charge Weaver unless he agreed to infiltrate Aryan Nations, but he refused. { Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony: Randy Weaver (Sep. 6, 1995), and DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORT ON INTERNAL REVIEW REGARDING THE RUBY RIDGE HOSTAGE SITUATION AND SHOOTINGS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, both from UMKC.edu } The court conflict escalated, eventually resulting in a warrant and a standoff during which Weaver&apos;s wife Vickie, son Sammy, and US Deputy Marshal William Degan were killed. [ Other ] Additional restrictions might apply in many other jurisdiction s. State and local laws might entirely prohibit civilian possession of short-barrelled shotguns. (These restrictions do not apply to military and police departments.) In addition, some firearm types that would normally be considered to fall into the Short Barrel Shotgun (SBS) category are not legally considered to be a SBS. A shotgun is legally defined as a shoulder mounted firearm that fires shot. Shotguns and shotgun receivers that have never had a buttstock of any type installed are not shotguns, as they cannot be shoulder mounted. Therefore, cutting one of these below the 18 &quot; barrel and/or 26 &quot; overall length cannot produce a SBS as the firearm was never a shotgun. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives recognizes these firearms as being a smooth bore handgun which is an Any Other Weapon (AOW). Unlike an SBS, an AOW only carries a $5.00 tax and can be moved interstate without Federal approval. However, to maintain its AOW status, it must not have a buttstock (making it a SBS) or a rifled slug barrel (making it a Destructive Device (DD) if the bore is over 0.5 &quot; ). Firearms of this type are typically over 100 years old. These weapons produced with a barrel length under 18 &quot; are not considered sawed-off shotguns because they were not produced with a shoulder buttstock. Weapons with these specifications fall under the category of smooth bore handguns produced in heavy rifle calibers and 12/20 gauge shotgun calibers, contrary to illegal sawed-off shotguns and are not considered destructive devices. Any firearms capable of shooting shotgun style cartridges produced after the 18 &quot; minimum barrel restrictions were set into place are considered illegal sawed-off shotguns. [ Police and military use ] This short-barrelled shotgun was manufactured with a reduced-length barrel, rather than being modified after its manufacture. Historical military use of sawed-off shotguns includes use as a primary weapon for Confederate cavalry during the American Civil War. These muzzle-loaded weapons were used primarily for close-range combat and to supplement the availability of more traditional short ranged weapons such as the saber or carbine. The availability of the source weapons and the ability to use single ball, shot, or a mix of both as the situation required were reasons why they were initially desired by those establishing Confederate cavalry units. They were replaced over time as more conventional arms became available and as the tactical use of cavalry shifted towards use as mounted infantry. { H &amp; K Fabarm FP6 Entry - features a 14 &quot; barrel and is classified as a short-barrelled shotgun in the U.S. } In modern usage, minimum length and barrel length restrictions only apply to civilian use; military and police departments may issue short-barreled shotguns, and major manufacturers offer special models with barrels in the range of [ 10 to 14 in cm ] as riot shotgun s or combat shotgun s for use in areas with restricted space. These are generally referred to as &quot; entry shotguns &quot;, because they are generally used for entering buildings, where the short easy handling is more important than the increased ammunition capacity of a longer shotgun. Breaching round s provide another use for very short shotguns. These rounds are usually made of sintered powdered metal, but a normal buckshot or bird shot round will also work. A shotgun is used for breaching by placing the gun next to a door lock (0 to 2 inches away, 0 to 5  cm), and firing at a 45 degrees downward angle through the door between the lock or latch and the door frame. The impact of the projectile(s) opens a hole through the door, removing the latch or locking bolt. When through the door, the shot or sintered metal disperses quickly, and because it was aimed downwards, the risk of harming occupants on the other side of the breached door is minimized. Breaching guns used by police and the military may have barrels as short as [ 10 in cm ], and they often have only a pistol grip rather than a full butt stock. Some models use a special cup-like muzzle extension to further minimize the risk of debris injuring the shooter. Because few rounds are fired, any sporting shotgun with a 3 round capacity could be shortened and used as a capable breaching shotgun. [ Barrel length and shot spread ] Shortening the length of a shotgun barrel does not significantly affect the pattern or spread of the pellets until it is decreased to under 50% of a typical barrel length. { Moreau, T. S., Nickels, M. L., Wray, J. L, Bottemiller, K. W., and Rowe, W. F., &quot; Pellet Patterns Fired by Sawed-Off Shotguns, &quot; Journal of Forensic Sciences, JFSCA, Vol. 30, No. 1, January 1985, pp. 137-149. } The pattern is primarily affected by the type of cartridge fired and the choke, or constriction normally found at the muzzle of a shotgun barrel. Cutting off the end of the barrel removes the choke, which generally only extends about two inches (about 5  cm) inward from the muzzle. This results in a cylinder bore, which causes the widest spread generally found in shotgun barrels. For an even wider pattern, special &quot; spreader chokes &quot; or &quot; spreader loads &quot; can be used, that are designed to spread the shot farther. (See choke for more information on the impact of chokes. See shotgun shell for information on spreader loads.) See details on shot patterning. [ Civilian usage ] In the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, where handgun s are not easily obtainable, the sawed-off shotgun was a common weapon in armed robberies during and shortly after the 1960s, and it is this use that most people associate with the weapon. However, in more recent years, handguns and handgun replicas have been more easily available in the United Kingdom, despite an increase in legal restrictions on civilian ownership of handguns in the area: sawed-off shotguns were used in only 157 out of a total of 3727 robberies involving firearms in England and Wales from 2004 to 2005, while handguns comprised 2501 of the weapons used in these robberies. { Violent Crime Overview, Homicide and Gun Crime (Supplementary Volume to Crime in England and Wales 2004/2005) } A sawed-off shotgun with exposed, manually cocked hammers, and dual triggers is known as a lupara ( &quot; wolf-shot &quot; ) in Italy, and while associated with organized crime, was originally used by Sicilian farmers and shepherds to protect their vineyards and flocks of animals. [ Chalker Dennis Dennis Chalker One Perfect Op: an Insider’s Account of the Navy Seal Special Warfare Teams Dockery 2002 Morrow New York 251 0-671-02465-5 ] In rural areas of North India, where it is seen as a weapon of authority and prestige, it is known as a dunali, literally meaning &quot; two pipes &quot;. It is especially common in Bihar, Purvanchal, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. The bank robber Clyde Barrow modified his Browning A-5 shotgun by cutting the barrel down to the same length as the magazine tube, and shortening the stock by [ 5 to 6 in mm ] to make it more concealable. A small, [ 10 - 12 in mm on ] strap was attached to both ends of the butt of the gun, and was looped around his shoulder, concealing the gun between his arm and chest under his jacket in the manner of a shoulder holster. The gun was drawn up quickly and fired from the shoulder under which it was carried. Barrow dubbed it the &quot; Whippit &quot;, as he was able to &quot; whip it &quot; out easily. The light weight of short-barreled shotguns, particularly in configurations that lack substantial stocks, leads some users to use short &apos;minishells&apos; with lower shot and powder loading for comfortable casual use.
