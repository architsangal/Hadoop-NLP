Launched on 20 September 1998 it was Ireland&apos;s first commercial broadcaster. { http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/home/tv-to-plug-a-gap-in-eires-market/2023438.article } The channel is operated by TV3 Group owned by Tullamore Beta Limited a subsidiary of Doughty Hanson &amp; Co. TV3 competes with the Irish national broadcaster&apos;s RTÉ ONE for the title of Ireland &apos;s most watched television channel. [ The TV3 Group ] The TV3 Group was established in January 2009. The network operates TV3 and its sister channel 3e and its online service tv3.ie. The networks studios is located at Ballymount, Dublin. TV3 was initially the first channel from the network launched in 1998. The network expanded in 2008 when TV3 purchased rival channel Channel 6 and rebranded the channel in January 2009 as 3e. In November 2008, tv3.ie website was rebranded, with the intention to develop it into an entertainment portal. Catch up facilities, as well as exclusive content is available for TV3 programming as are news, weather, sport and entertainment updates. In October 2011, 3Player a video-on-demand service was launched. [ History ] [ Initial idea and setbacks ] TV3, which was intended to be Ireland&apos;s third terrestrial channel, took almost ten years to bring from initial planning to debut. In October 1988 the Independent Radio and Television Commission (IRTC) was created to regulate new independent stations. The original TV3 licence to broadcast was granted in 1990 to a consortium including members of U2 and the owner of the Windmill Lane Studios where the group had made many of their records. [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DN3fxgnnJhEU Reeling In The Years 1989 1999 RTÉ 20 May 2010 ] Initially it was envisaged that the station would only broadcast on cable and MMDS but it was later decided that the station should broadcast on terrestrial UHF also. Because of delays in setting up the station, the licence was revoked by the IRTC. After a court battle, the licence was eventually restored in 1993. Logo in 1989 at the IRTC announcement of a 3rd Channel. At this stage, an agreement was made to sell 49% of the company to UTV, the ITV franchise in Northern Ireland, to raise much-needed cash for investment in facilities. However, as TV3 were trying to convince Irish cable and MMDS carriers to replace UTV with their channel, the new shareholders pulled out in 1995. Given that UTV had the third largest audience in the Republic, the carriers declined to drop them in favour of TV3. The result was that the project was on hold again. In 1997, CanWest, decided to step in and buy a major stake in the new company. [ Launch and development ] TV3 finally took to the air on 20 September 1998 at 17:30. A preview of the station&apos;s programming formed the first half-hour of transmissions, followed by the first TV3 News at 18:00.TV3 was the fourth national station to be launched in Ireland; after RTÉ One in 1961 (as Teilifís Éireann), RTÉ Two in 1978 and TG4 in 1996 (as TnaG). It was the first Irish station which was not publicly funded. TV3&apos;s initial on-air branding referred to the station as &apos;tvthree&apos;, although this was part of the corporate logo up to 2009 it was dropped from their on-screen brand in 2001. The Schoolhouse Rock! song, &quot; Three Is A Magic Number &quot;, was the station&apos;s theme tune, played every day during start-up and close-down. In September 2000, Granada Media plc (a predecessor company of ITV plc which then owned six ITV franchises) agreed to acquire 45% of the company from the original TV3 consortium. This was part of deal which gave TV3 the right to simulcast with ITV certain Granada programming. The Granada plc shareholding was taken over by ITV plc upon the merger of Granada with Carlton on 2 February 2004. In early 2001, the station officially launched threetext, the teletext service, much of the content from Thomas Crosbie Media. Test transmissions of this service commenced in late 2000, but as early as 1999 limited programming content was provided. However, in 2004, the news and sports were dropped as part of a rebranding to an &apos;entertainment portal&apos;. On 16 January 2006, Canwest announced to TV3 staff, that it was selling its stake in the channel, [ http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0116/canwest.html Canwest to sell share in TV3 7 March 2009 RTÉ News 16 January 2006 ] in an effort to reduce its debt, resulting in it leaving the European market. A purchaser for this stake for (for €103 million), rights to buy ITV Plc&apos;s stake (for €103 million), and the remaining 10% (for €59 million) was announced on 19 May as Doughty Hanson &amp; Co, a venture capital firm. It was later confirmed that ITVplc would also sell its share. { http://www.digitalspy.ie/media/news/a36211/itv-agrees-to-sell-tv3-stake.html } The channel began broadcasting in widescreen format on Sky Ireland from 6 March 2006 and subsequently on UPC in 2007. In July 2008 TV3 bought rival Irish Broadcaster Channel 6 and in January 2009 rebranded the channel as 3e, in line with it main service TV3. In January 2009 TV3 relaunched under the corporate name of The TV3 Group (Officially they remain TV3 Television Network Limited). The TV3 Group consists of TV3, 3e and tv3.i.e. TV3 also sought a Radio licence from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) for a Multicity service, known as More FM the service was aimed at an over 45 age group, the licence was won by 4FM, TV3 have not sought to enter the radio market since. [ Present services ] [ Analogue Terrestrial Television ] Upon its launch in 1998, TV3 utilized the existing RTÉNL main transmitter masts around the country. It also utilizes three relay services located in Cork City and Limerick City. Availability of TV3 in some rural areas has been limited as TV3 have failed to invest in relay stations for most notably in County Donegal, County Kerry and County Cork. Many rural areas are reliant on satellite reception to receive TV3 via Sky Ireland, this option requires a subscription service. Effectively, TV3 is now available to 98% of homes through Saorview and Saorsat. { http://www.sbpost.ie/news/ireland/rte-must-have-dtt-operational-by-october-48251.html } Similar to other broadcasters in Europe, TV3 will cease broadcasting on analogue from December 2012 or thereafter. [ Digital Terrestrial Television ] In October 29, 2010, as Ireland moved towards full integration of digital terrestrial television through Saorview. Both TV3 and its sister channel 3e have been available on test trials of Saorview since October 29, 2010. { http://www.saorview.ie/channels-services/ } As of May 2011, both channels are now available to 98% of the population. { http://www.saorview.ie/what-is-saorview/key-features/rollout-schedule/ } Between 2008 and 2010, with the development of digital terrestrial television (dtt) within Ireland. The TV3 Group had ambitions to play a significant role in helping to develop the pay television element of DTT in Ireland. TV3 Group helped to shape a consortium known as One Vision (DTT) which was also made up of Arqiva, Eircom and Setanta Sports. OneVision submitted its proposal { http://www.bci.ie/DTT/one_vision/app1.pdf } to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (then the BCI). Initially, Onevision was unsuccessful at gaining the opportunity to operate the pay television element of Ireland&apos;s national DTT service. Negotiations between Boxer TV and BCI failed and on May 1, 2009 Fintan Drury, chairperson of the OneVision consortium announced that OneVision was to enter negotiations with the BCI with the view to take over operations of the pay DTT service.

This service is not expected to launch until late 2012 or thereafter. [ TV3 iPhone App ] On Friday, 24 September 2010 TV3 launched its iPhone application. { http://www.tv3.ie/shows.php?request=tv3app } The service is free to download and offers TV3 viewers the opportunity to watch TV3 content including news, showbiz and sport. It also supplies audiences with an on-demand catch-up service which allows its viewers to watch streamed content. { http://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/tv3-app/id393340799?mt=8 } [ 3Player ] TV3&apos;s Video on Demand (VOD) relaunched on Saturday, October 8, 2011. { http://blog.marketing.ie/?p=7467 } 3Player { http://www.tv3.ie/3player } replaces the original TV3 Catch-Up service previously available at tv3.ie and through its iPhone/iPad app. The new service was revealed at a press call on Friday, October 7, 2011. It is estimated by the TV3 Group that the service will be worth about €7.5 million by 2015. 3Player is in HTML5 format which makes it available on the majority of operating systems. [ Future ] In 2011 TV3 proposed 3 new services and a HD version of TV3 to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. 3KIDS a children&apos;s service for the over 6s, which is to timeshare with 3CLASSICS a documentary and rerun service. They have also suggested a timeshift channel known as TV3+1. The BAI have suggested that these channel will begin broadcasting closer to (or after) analogue switch off in October 2012, TV3 suggested a launch in September 2012 [ http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20110815_BAIDTTEOI_FINAL.pdf Report and Recommendations by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on the exercise of its functions under Statutory Instrument No.67 of 2011 Broadcasting Authority of Ireland 5, 14 28 January 2012 ]. TV3 Group initially proposed to launch two channels to appear on the OneVision pay television service. These channels included a news and current affairs channel called 3TODAY and a channel skewed towards women called 3XPOSÉ /. Onevision withdrew from offering the pay television element to Ireland&apos;s digital terrestrial television Saorview after negotiations with the BAI failed due to difficulties with the terms of RTÉ NL apparently regarding multiplexing, marketing for DTT and other issues. The 3Today service was expected to appear on the Onevision DTT service. The channel was expected to air both Irish and international bespoke programing in current affairs as well as drama, comedy and documentary titles from some of the world’s bestproducers. As of August 2011, it has now emerged that TV3 propose to launch three new channels in late 2012, which vary from their original plans. The first channel is TV3 HD which will air TV3 content in high-definition. TV3 confirmed its plan to build a new HD studio in 2011. [ http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0818/1224302638633.html The Irish Times Ronan McGreevy TV3 to build EUR 4m studio for live audience shows 18 August 2011 ] The new studio will be used to provide new programming in HD and it will also allow independent companies to make use of the new studios also., TV3+1 which will act as a timeshift channel to TV3. 3 Kids which will air programming aimed at 4-12 year olds and 3 Classics a channel which focuses on Irish documentaries and film. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland suggests that these channels will launch in October 2012 before ASO/DSO takes place. { http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20110815_BAIDTTEOI_FINAL.pdf } [ Broadcasting Policy ] TV3 broadcasts a wide range of programming which in its early years depended heavily on international acquisitions. In 2008, the TV3 Group produced a three-year strategy to increase the amount of homegrown productions on the channel. Under their contract with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI), TV3 are required since 2008 to have 30% of their programming coming from Ireland though TV3 now produces 40% Irish produced content (Most of this content comes from in studio productions such as Ireland AM and Xposé ). In 2010 TV3 announced a target of 50% Irish programming by 2012. TV3 has also confirmed its plan to build a major new studio in 2011 which will be fully HD capable with audience capacity. They have a small staff of 200 employees to run two television channels and one on-demand online service. On average, TV3 spend about €10 million on internal productions which are generally for daytime viewers. They do not have a history of strong prime-time content: generally their home produced programmes consist of at least one independently produced programme, e.g. The Apprentice, a number of internal documentaries such as Ireland Undercover and a number of BCI licence fee-funded independent products such as School Run,Diary of... andModern Ireland. As of October 2009, TV3 claim they are the most watched television channel by people aged 15–24 years old. This group was previously captured by RTÉ One. { http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record &amp; only=1 &amp; aid=73 &amp; rid=4282637 &amp; tpl=archnewshome &amp; force=1 } This is an important group to capture as it is often these viewers whom advertisers wish to target. { http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=THE+INSIDE+TRACK-qqqs=mediaandmarketing-qqqid=45193-qqqx=1.asp } In reaction to this press release from TV3, RTÉ rebutted their claims stating that RTÉ One outdoes TV3 in far more demographic categories and that TV3&apos;s press release, &quot; In terms of the selective audiences focussed upon by TV3 in their release, it&apos;s clear this is a recent phenomenon and only pertains to a narrow sub-demographic of young viewers in this country. By contrast, the year-to-date equivalent (1 January - 20 October), all day national share, sees RTÉ One with a 16.2% share of the 15-24s; TV3 with a 13.3% share. &quot; [ http://www.rte.ie/about/pressreleases/2009/1022/responsetotv3221009.html RTÉ News Response from RTÉ Television to TV3 Release on young Television Viewers 22 October 2009 ] [ Budget &lt; ref &gt; &lt; template type= &quot; cite news &quot; &gt; &lt; tag name= &quot; url &quot; &gt; http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/1024/1224257392869.html &lt; /tag &gt; &lt; tag name= &quot; work &quot; &gt; The Irish Times &lt; /tag &gt; &lt; tag name= &quot; title &quot; &gt; Doughty Hanson takes writedown of €54m on investment in TV3 &lt; /tag &gt; &lt; tag name= &quot; date &quot; &gt; 10 October 2009 &lt; /tag &gt; &lt; /template &gt; &lt; /ref &gt; ] In 2009 TV3 had revenues of €54,300,000. In the previous year (2008), TV3 received €62 million in advertising revenue. Increases in programme cost during 2008 included new sporting contracts with the GAA and UEFA, the first renewal of their contract with the British broadcaster ITV for shows such as The X Factor and Coronation Street, a small but significant increase in programmes commissioned from independent producers and their takeover of Channel 6 (now 3e ). They also increased their investment in online technology, with their online service earning a profit for the first time. In 2008, TV3 received €3 million in funding from the licence fee for independent productions on the channel. In 2009, two rounds of redundancies reduced TV3 staff to 213 people. Staff savings have been augmented by agreed reductions in wages. The 200 staff working in TV3 now provide seven hours of live television five days a week, an increase of two hours and a staff reduction of 50 since 2007. In February 2012 the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) restructure TV3&apos;s outstanding loans to the bank. The owners of TV3, Doherty Hanson &amp; Co., have loans of €140million with the bank. €51million will continue to be repaid over the next 5 years, while €81.1 will be frozen until a &quot; liquidity event &quot;, according to the IBRC this is in the event of a sale of TV3.
