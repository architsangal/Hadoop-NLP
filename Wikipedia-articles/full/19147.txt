Geographically, the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia, with the population of around 68,000 people spread out over 34 low-lying coral atoll s, comprising 1,156 individual island s and islet s. The islands share maritime boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west, Wake Island to the north, [ Note2 note ^ ] Kiribati to the south-east, and Nauru to the south. The most populous atoll is Majuro, which also acts as the capital. Micronesian colonists gradually settled the Marshall Islands during the 2nd millennium BC, with inter-island navigation made possible using traditional stick chart s. Islands in the archipelago were first explored by Europeans in the 1520s, with Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar sighting an atoll in August 1526. Other expeditions by Spanish and English ships followed, with the islands&apos; current name stemming from British explorer John Marshall. Recognised as part of the Spanish East Indies in 1874, the islands were sold to Germany in 1884, and became of German New Guinea in 1885. The Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands in World War I, which were later joined with other former German territories in 1919 by the League of Nations to form the South Pacific Mandate. In World War II, the islands were conquered by the United States in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. Along with other Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands were then consolidated into the United-States-governed Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Self-government was achieved in 1979, and full sovereignty in 1986, under a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Politically, the Marshall Islands is a presidential republic in free association with the United States, with the US providing defense, funding grants, and access to social services. Having few natural resources, the islands&apos; wealth is based on a service economy, as well as some fishing and agriculture, with a large percentage of the islands&apos; gross domestic product coming from United States aid. The country uses the United States dollar as its currency. The majority of citizens of the Marshall Islands are of Marshallese descent, with small numbers of immigrants from the Philippines and other Pacific islands. The two official language s are Marshallese, a member of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, and English. Almost the entire population of the islands practises some religion, with three-quarters of the country either following the United Church of Christ – Congregational in the Marshall Islands (UCCCMI) or the Assemblies of God. [ History ] [ History of the Marshall Islands ] The Marshall Islands were settled by Micronesia ns in the 2nd millennium BC. Little is known of this early history. People traveled by canoe between islands using traditional stick chart s. { The History of Mankind by Professor Friedrich Ratzel, Book II, Section A, The Races of Oceania page 165, picture of a stick chart from the Marshall Islands. MacMillan and Co., published 1896. } [ Spanish exploration ] Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar was the first Europe an to see the islands in 1526, commanding the ship Santa Maria de la Victoria, the only surviving vessel of the Loaísa Expedition. On August 21, he sighted an island at 14°N that they named &quot; San Bartolome &quot; (probably Taongi ). { Sharp, pp. 11–3 } On September 21, 1529, Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón commanded the Spanish ship Florida, on his second attempt to recross the Pacific from the Moluccas. He stood off a group of islands from which several natives came off and hurled stones at his ship. These islands, named by him &quot; Los Pintados, &quot; may have been Ujelang. On October 1, he found another group of islands where he went ashore for eight days, exchanged gifts with natives and took on water. These islands, &quot; Los Jardines, &quot; could be Eniwetok or Bikini Atoll. { Wright 1951: 109–10 } { Sharp, pp. 19–23 } The Spanish ship San Pedro and two other vessels in expedition commanded by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi on January 9, discovered an island at 10°N where they went ashore and traded with natives and named it &quot; Los Barbudos &quot; (possibly Mejit ). On January 10, they sighted another island that they named &quot; Placeres &quot; (perhaps Ailuk ), ten leagues away, they sighted another island that they called &quot; Pajares &quot; (perhaps Jemo ). On January 12, they sighted another island at 10°N which they called &quot; Corrales &quot; (possibly Wotho ). On January 15, another low island was sighted at 10°N (perhaps Ujelang ) where they made a good description of the people on &quot; Barbudos. &quot; { Filipiniana Book Guild 1965: 46–8, 91, 240 } { Sharp, pp. 36–9 } After that, ships like San Jeronimo, Los Reyes, Todos los Santos also visited the islands in different years. [ Other European expeditions ] [ German New Guinea ] Captain John Charles Marshall together with Thomas Gilbert came to the islands in 1788. The islands were named after the first in the Russian ( Krusenstern ) and French ( Duperrey ) maps (1820), later in the English maps. However, they were claimed under the Spanish sovereignty as part of the Spanish East Indies. In 1874, the Spanish sovereignty was recognized by the international community. They were sold to Germany in 1884 through papal mediation. A German trading company settled on the islands in 1885. They became part of the protectorate of German New Guinea some years later. [ World War I ] [ South Pacific Mandate ] Under German Imperial control, and even before then, Japanese traders and fishermen from time to time visited the Marshall Islands, although contact with the islanders was irregular. After the Meiji Restoration (1868), the Japanese government adopted a policy of turning Japan into a great economic and military power in East Asia. In 1914, Japan joined the Entente powers during World War I, and found it possible to capture German colonies in China and Micronesia. On September 29, 1914, Japanese troops occupied the atoll of Enewetak, and on September 30, 1914 the atoll of Jaluit the administrative center of the Marshall Islands. [ Marshall Islands. Geographic Background http://web.archive.org/web/20090303214701/http%3A//www.enenkio.org/adobe/GeographyMarshallIslands.pdf enenkio.org ] After the war, on June 28, 1919, Germany renounced all of its Pacific possessions, including the Marshall Islands. On December 17, 1920, the Council of the League of Nations approved the mandate for Japan to take over all former German colonies in the Pacific Ocean located north of the equator. The Administrative Center of the Marshall Islands atoll remained Jaluit. The Japanese were unlike the German Empire, which had primarily economic interests in Micronesia. Despite its small area and few resources, the absorption of the territory by Japan would to some extent alleviate Japan&apos;s problem of an increasing population but an ever decreasing amount of available land to house it. [ Marshall Islands http://piasdgserver.usp.ac.fj/peacenet//index.php?id%3D152 Pacific Institute of Advanced Studies in Development and Governance (PIAS-DG), University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji 11 June 2010 ] [ May 2012 ] During its years of colonial rule, Japan moved more than 1,000 Japanese to the Marshall Islands although they never outnumbered the indigenous peoples as they did in the Mariana Islands and Palau. The Japanese enlarged administration and appointed local leaders, which weakened the authority of local traditional leaders. Japan also tried to change the social organization in the islands from Matrilineality to the Japanese Patriarchal system, but with no success. Moreover, during the 1930s, one third of all land up to the high water level was declared the property of the Japanese government. On the archipelago, before it banned foreign traders, the activities of Catholic and Protestant missionaries were allowed. Indigenous people were educated in Japanese schools, and studied Japanese language and Japanese culture. This policy was the government strategy not only in the Marshall Islands, but on all the other mandated territories in Micronesia. On March 27, 1933, Japan left the League of Nations, but nevertheless continued to manage the islands in the region and in the late 1930s, and started constructing air bases on several atolls.The Marshall Islands were in an important geographical position, being the easternmost point in Japan&apos;s defensive ring at the beginning of World War II.

[ Marshall Islands http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Marshall_islands.htm World Statesmen 11 June 2010 ] In World War II, the United States, during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, invaded and occupied the islands in 1944, destroying or isolating the Japanese garrisons. The US government added the archipelago to the U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, along with several other island groups in the South Sea. The battle in the Marshall Islands caused irreparable damage, especially on Japanese bases. During the American bombing, the islands&apos; population suffered from lack of food and various injuries. U.S. attacks started in mid-1943, and caused half the Japanese garrison of 5,100 people in the atoll Mili to die from hunger by August 1945. [ Dirk H.R. Spennemann Mili Island, Mili Atoll: a brief overview of its WWII sites http://marshall.csu.edu.au/Marshalls/html/WWII/Mili.html 11 June 2010 ] In just one month in 1944, Americans captured Kwajalein Atoll, Majuro and Enewetak, and in the next two months the rest of the Marshall Islands except Wotje, Mili, Maloelap and Jaluit.

Project 4.1 was a medical study conducted by the United States of those residents of the Bikini Atoll exposed to radioactive fallout. From 1956 to August 1998, at least $759 million was paid to the Marshallese Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear testing.

[ Independence ] In 1979, the Government of the Marshall Islands was officially established and the country became self-governing. In 1986, the Compact of Free Association with the United States entered into force, granting the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) its sovereignty. The Compact provided for aid and U.S. defense of the islands in exchange for continued U.S. military use of the missile testing range at Kwajalein Atoll. The independence procedure was formally completed under international law in 1990, when the UN officially ended the Trusteeship status.

The country consists of 29 atoll s and 5 isolated islands. The atolls and islands form two groups: the Ratak Chain and the Ralik Chain (meaning &quot; sunrise &quot; and &quot; sunset &quot; chains).24 of them are inhabited (see above section).

This is the world&apos;s largest shark sanctuary, extending the worldwide ocean area in which sharks are protected from [ 2700000 km2 sqmi -3 ] to [ 4600000 km2 sqmi -3 ]. In protected waters all shark fishing is banned and all by-catch must be released. However, the ability of the Marshall Islands to enforce this zone has been questioned.

[ Agriculture ] Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms. The most-important commercial crops are coconut s, tomato es, melon s, and breadfruit. [ Industry ] Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. [ Fishing ] Fishing has been critical to the economy of this island nation since its settlement. In 1999, a private company built a tuna loining plant with more than 400 employees, mostly women. But the plant closed in 2005, after a failed attempt to convert it to produce tuna steaks, a process that requires half as many employees. Operating costs exceeded revenue, and the plant&apos;s owners tried to partner with the government to prevent closure. But government officials personally interested in an economic stake in the plant refused to help. After the plant closed, it was taken over by the government, which had been the guarantor of a $2 million loan to the business. [ Energy ] On September 15, 2007, Witon Barry (of the Tobolar Copra processing plant in the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro ) said power authorities, private companies, and entrepreneurs had been experimenting with coconut oil as alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles, power generators, and ships. Coconut tree s abound in the Pacific&apos;s tropical islands. Copra, the meat of the coconut, yields coconut oil (1 liter for every 6 to 10 coconuts).

A minority of Marshallese have some recent Asian ancestry, mainly Japanese. Two-thirds of the nation&apos;s population lives on Majuro, the capital, and Ebeye. The outer islands are sparsely populated due to lack of employment opportunities and economic development. Life on the outer atolls is generally traditional.
