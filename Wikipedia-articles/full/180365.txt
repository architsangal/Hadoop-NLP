[ 1953 02 20 ] [ 1984 03 30 1953 02 20 ] { Quebec City, } { Quebec } { Alleged } { patient zero for } { AIDS } { Flight attendant } Gaëtan Dugas ( [ ɡaetɑ̃ dyˈɡa lang ]; February 20, 1953  – March 30, 1984) was a French Canadian who worked for Air Canada as a flight attendant. { &quot; La découverte de la maladie  — Sida, les premières années &quot; (Discovering the illness  — AIDS, the first years), } { Radio-Canada, 17 January 1992 } Dugas became notorious as the alleged patient zero for AIDS, though he is now more accurately regarded as one of many highly sexually active men who spread HIV widely before the disease was identified. [ Patient Zero allegation ] A study published in the American Journal of Medicine in 1984 traced many of New York City &apos;s early HIV infections to an unnamed infected homosexual male flight attendant. Epidemiologists hypothesized that Dugas had carried the virus out of Africa and introduced it into the Western gay community. [ Auerbach D.M. W.W. Darrow, H.W. Jaffe, and J.W. Curran Cluster of cases of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Patients linked by sexual contact The American Journal of Medicine 76 3 487–92 1984 March 2007 10.1016/0002-9343(84)90668-5 6608269 ] Dugas is featured prominently in Randy Shilts &apos;s book And the Band Played On, which documents the outbreak of AIDS in the United States. Shilts portrays Gaëtan Dugas as having almost sociopathic behavior by allegedly intentionally infecting, or at least recklessly endangering, others with the virus. Dugas is described as being a charming, handsome sexual athlete who, according to his own estimation, averaged hundreds of sex partners a year. He claims to have had over 2,500 sexual partners across North America since becoming sexually active in 1972. [ Gladwell Malcolm Malcolm Gladwell The Tipping Point Little Brown 2000 21 0-316-34662-4 ] In addition, Dugas was legally married in Los Angeles on June 27, 1977 in an illegal attempt to receive United States citizenship. According to Snopes.com : [ http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/aidsmary.asp AIDS Mary Mikkelson Barbara Snopes.com 2006-10-06 ] Dugas died in Quebec City on March 30, 1984, as a result of kidney failure caused by continual AIDS-related infections. [ Shilts Randy Randy Shilts And The Band Played On Penguin 1988 439 0-14-011130-1 ] The &quot; Patient Zero &quot; term arose in March 1984 after a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study. The CDC began tracking the sexual liaisons and practices of homosexual men in California, New York, and some other states. As Dugas was found to be the center of a network of sexual partners, he was dubbed &quot; patient 0 &quot;. [ Analysis and criticism ] Genetic analysis of HIV provides some support for the Patient Zero theory. Dugas is now believed to be part of a cluster of homosexual men who traveled frequently, were extremely sexually active, and died of AIDS at a very early stage in the epidemic. [ Kuiken C Thakallapalli R, Esklid A, de Ronde A Genetic analysis reveals epidemiologic patterns in the spread of human immunodeficiency virus American Journal of Epidemiology 152 9 814–22 Los Alamos National Laboratory 2000-11-01 March 2007 10.1093/aje/152.9.814 11085392 ] However, a number of authorities have since voiced reservations about the implications of the CDC Patient Zero study, and characterisations of Dugas as being responsible for bringing HIV to cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the patient zero study, the average length of time between sexual contact and the onset of symptoms was 10.5 months. At the time of the study it was not known that the average length of time between initial infection and AIDS is ten years. While Shilts&apos;s book does not make such an allegation, the rumour that Dugas was the principal disseminator of the virus became widespread. In 1988, Andrew R. Moss published an opposing view in the New York Review of Books. { Moss, Andrew R. &quot; AIDS Without End &quot;, The New York Review of Books, December 8, 1988, retrieved December 2, 2006 } A November 2007 article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences dismisses the Patient Zero hypothesis and claims that AIDS transited from Africa to Haiti in 1966 and from Haiti to the United States in 1969. { AIDS virus invaded U.S. from Haiti: study } { The emergence of HIV/AIDS in the Americas and beyond. } Robert Rayford has since been confirmed as the first documented victim of HIV/AIDS in North America, [ Kolata Gina Gina Kolata Boy&apos;s 1969 Death Suggests AIDS Invaded U.S. Several Times The New York Times 28 October 1987 http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9B0DEFD6173AF93BA15753C1A961948260%26amp%3Bsec%3Dhealth%26amp%3Bpagewanted%3Dall 11 February 2009 ] having died at age 16 in May 1969.
