The Orlando Renegades were a professional American football team that played in the United States Football League in the mid-1980s. [ In Washington ] [ #009B48 ] [ #1E1E1E ] [ #85888B ] [ #FFFFFF ] { Washington Federals (1983-84) Orlando Renegades (1985) } { 1983-4 } { Ray Jauch (4-15) 1984 } { Dick Bielski (3-14) } { 1983-4 Berl Bernhard } [ 1983 season ] The Renegades started out in 1983 as the Washington Federals and played in Washington, D.C. &apos;s Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium under the ownership of prominent Washington attorney Berl Bernhard. The team lured Ray Jauch to be its head coach; he had previously guided the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to success in the Canadian Football League. At the time he was the fourth-winningest coach in CFL history. The Federals finished 4-14, tied for the worst record in the league. However, they were far more competitive than their record indicated. Eight of their losses were by a touchdown or less. They had a fair amount of offensive talent skill players with comparatively good depth. More than any other team in the league, the Federals seemed dogged by inconsistency, bad timing, and terrible luck. A week before the season even began, their player personnel expert bolted to the NFL &apos;s New York Jets. The first game in franchise history was a portent of things to come; the Federals were drilled at RFK 28-7 by the Chicago Blitz, the preseason title favorites coached by former Washington Redskins coach George Allen. The game was played on March 6, 1983, just five weeks after the Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl XVII. The Blitz, led by former Lions and Colts Quarterback Greg Landry, raced out to a 28-0 lead. The Federals were so terrible in the game, the Blitz held Washington to only one first down, and a mere 24 yards total offense in the first half. Chicago led 21-0 before the Federals ever recorded a second first down. By that time, Landry hit 15 of his first 17 pass attempts, including a 23 yard touchdown pass to Trumaine Johnson. Kim McQuilken had a horrible debut as the Federals quarterback, and was replaced by back up Mike Hohensee. Hohensee accounted for the Federals only score, a 19 yard pass to Walker Lee. The next week went ever worse for Washington, as quarterback Hohensee, Running back Craig James and wide receiver Reggie Smith all were injured. McQuilken could only muster 3 points of offense, while throwing two more interceptions. In week 3, the Federals led the Boston Breakers 16-9 with less than five minutes to go in regulation. However, two bad snaps on special teams led to a 19-16 loss. Playing at home week three, the Federals finally got a victory. They managed to defeat the Michigan Panthers, one of the better teams in the USFL and future league champions. The Panthers were led by future NFL quarterback Bobby Herbert, and wide receiver Anthony Carter, one of the fastest players in the league. Federals QB Kim McQuilken had one of his better games, completing 24 of 48 passes and throwing for 324 yards. He threw three touchdowns compared to one interceptions. Panthers Lineback Robert Pennywell intercepted McQuilken, which led to a game trying score on a pass play from Herbert to Derek Holloway. The game went into overtime, where Washington won on a 22 yard pass from McQuilken to Joey Walters. In week 6, the Federals led the Arizona Wranglers 21-16, only to have a potential game-sealing drive stall on the 2-yard-line. The Wranglers&apos; first play from scrimmage after that was a 98-yard touchdown passâ€”the longest in league history. The Federals saved their best game for last in the 1983 season. Playing at home against the Philadelphia Stars, the Federals shocked the league by defeating the 15-2 Stars 21 to 14. When all was said and done, despite the fact the Federals were a mere 4-14, there was one positive, they had defeated both teams who later played in the USFL championship game that year. It seemed like it was going to be another blow out loss. The Stars, led by all league quarterback Chuck Fusina, led 14-6 going into half time. The Stars were a dominate team who had crushed Washington 34-3 earlier in the season. However, the Federals refused to bow down, as McQuilken hit Stan Rome with a 19 yard touchdown pass before half time. Lane had his best day ever as a pro, catching 17 passes for 170 yards. The Federals may have not been dominate in the second half, but they were good enough on this day. Federals rookie linebacker Mike Corvino helped stop two late Stars drives with a sack and interception, respectively. Former New York Giants running back Billy Taylor got in on the scoring for Washington with a six yard run in the third quarter. Washington was able to add two points on the conversation. McQuilken scored his first touchdown as a pro with a one yard run for the go ahead score in the fourth quarter. The Federals had pulled off an upset win over Atlantic division champion Stars, giving much promise for the 1984 season. The only USFL all-star on the team was reserve running back Eric Robinson, whose kickoff return for touchdown vs. Tampa Bay at RFK was the only kickoff return for touchdown in the USFL in 1983. The team changed QBs almost weekly, with different QBs finishing a number of games. In part, it was because the Federals were bitten repeatedly by the injury bug. Jauch&apos;s biggest mistake was probably giving the opening day starter, NFL veteran Kim McQuilken, the quick hook for rookie QB Mike Hohensee. From there the team never seemed to settle with a QB for more than a few games in a row and when McQuilken did play, he often pressed, forcing his throws into coverage. The team alternated between McQuilken and Hohensee, with occasional appearances by former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback &quot; Jefferson Street &quot; Joe Gilliam. He was way past his prime and only threw for 673 yards. The only other quarterback on the team was rookie Mike Forslund, who never got into a game. SMU star rookie running back Craig James was sidelined five games with a fractured vertebra. Hohensee only played in nine games all season. At one point, all of their receivers had leg injuries. The Federals had good linebackers in Joe Harris, Dan Lloyd and Jeff McIntyre. Washington&apos;s best Outside Linebacker, Jeff McIntyre, could cover receivers down field and stop the run. McIntyre lead the team in tackles and sacks until and ankle injury sidelined him for the remaining 6 games. However, they simply stayed on the field too long. Washington-area fans largely viewed the Federals with indifference. They only averaged 13,800 fans per game (in a 56,000-seat stadium). However, their marketing efforts were severely crippled by the Redskins&apos; Super Bowl victory.

There were a lot of reasons for optimism. In spite of the tremendous number of on field mistakes in 1983, the team had played with heart under Jauch, taking better teams down to the wire even at the end of the season. With just a few lucky breaks the Federals might have been almost a.500 teamâ€”and at best, a 12-6 teamâ€”in 1983. They had started the season 1-13, but had finished strongly going 3-1 in the last 4 games of the season. It appeared that the Federals had finally learned how to turn a close game into a win. With the league-wide talent pool expected to be stretched out due to expansion, the schedule seemed likely to be littered with a number of very winnable games. With McQuilken&apos;s post-season retirement, the team had an undisputed and seemingly capable starter at QB in Hohensee. The Birmingham Stallions&apos; acquisition of Cliff Stoudt made their quarterback Reggie Collier available and the Federals added him for depth alongside Hohensee and rookie Lou Pagley. Star HB Craig James was healthy. It seemed like the pitfalls that Jauch had fallen into in the first season might be missed this time around. Player familiarity with the system and their teammates and having a proven winner like Jauch as a coach suggested the Federals were bound to deliver better results in 1984. Unfortunately, the 1984 season came unraveled in a hurry. The league scheduled the Federals to open against the expansion Jacksonville Bulls in a probable effort to help the get the Federals off to a good start. Unfortunately, that plan backfired when the Bulls crushed the Federals 53-14. Hours before the game, the Federals cut all three of their starting linebackers, a move which hobbled the defense. The embarrassing loss forced Bernard to act to save face for his franchise. Jauch was fired after the game and replaced by former Maryland Terrapins and Dallas Cowboys running back Dick Bielski. In week 2, James suffered a season-ending injury. At that point, the season became a total fiasco --- even though Hohensee played fairly well for a second year starter finishing the season with a very respectable QB rating (for the USFL) of 72.2. Support was almost nonexistent; they only averaged 7,700 fans per game in 1984 (including a crowd of 4,432 against the Memphis Showboats ), the worst per-game attendance in league history. With little fan turnout and James&apos; frequent injuries, both the Federals and James were motivated to end their relationship. A little over a month into the season, James was given his release to allow him to sign with the NFL&apos;s Patriots. It took the Federals nine games to finally win. Among their season lowlights were two losses to the expansion Pittsburgh Maulers. The Federals finished 3-15, tied with the Maulers for the worst record in the league. Although the defense was awful throughout the season, the offense was respectable in the last 12 games or so. HB Curtis Bledsoe replaced James as the feature back, rushing for a respectable 1080 yards and 7 TDs in 1984. &quot; Go to &quot; WR Joey Walters caught 98 passes for 1410 yards with 7 TDs and made the 1984 TSN USFL All-Star Team, becoming the Federals&apos; main star. With six games left in the season, Bernhard (who once called the Federals &quot; trained gerbils &quot; ) gave up and sold the Federals to Florida real estate developer Woody Weiser, who announced plans to move the Federals to Miami. Weiser quickly signed up Howard Schnellenberger as the new coach after the season ended. However, on August 22, 1984, the league owners voted to move to a fall schedule in 1986. Weiser knew he could not possibly compete against the Miami Dolphins, so he canceled the deal. This left Bernhard in a desperate situation, as he knew that he stood no chance going head-to-head with the Redskins. A few days later, Tampa Bay Bandits part-owner Donald Dizney stepped up and ended Bernhard&apos;s suffering. Dizney bought the Federals, moving them to Orlando and renaming them the Renegades.

Lee Corso was hired as coach. Corso had a clear plan for the team. He decided to build around the very raw 3rd year QB Reggie Collier. After starting out looking much like the 1984 Federals, the Renegades were fairly competitive in their remaining 12 games as the mobile and talented Collier, who had been an abysmal failure in Birmingham and Washington in his first 2 seasons, began to develop. (Collier later went on to briefly play for the Dallas Cowboys). In 1985, in addition to Collier, the team&apos;s offense featured running back Curtis Bledsoe and WR Joey Walters. The Renegades were one of 8 teams selected to continue operations when the USFL elected to switch to a fall schedule in 1986, but the entire league collapsed before any fall games were played.
