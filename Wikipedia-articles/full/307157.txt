Found in the Andes mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, it has the largest wingspan (at 3.2 m or 10.5 ft) of any land bird. { The Andean Condor is exceeded in wingspan by the } { Wandering Albatross (at 3.6 m/12 ft) and perhaps the } { Dalmatian Pelican (at reportedly up to 3.5 m/11.6 ft). } It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird&apos;s emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female. The condor is primarily a scavenger, feeding on carrion. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of deer or cattle. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to [ 5000 m ft on ], generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world&apos;s longest-living birds, with a lifespan of up to 100 years old in captivity. The Andean Condor is a national symbol of Peru, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador, and plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions. The Andean Condor is considered near threatened by the IUCN. It is threatened by habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from carcasses killed by hunters. Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries. [ Taxonomy and systematics ] The Andean Condor was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae and retains its original binomial name of Vultur gryphus. [ Linnaeus C Carolus Linnaeus Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I. Editio decima, reformata.

(Laurentii Salvii). 1758 86 ] The Andean Condor is sometimes called the Argentinean Condor, Bolivian Condor, Chilean Condor, Colombian Condor, Ecuadorian Condor, or Peruvian Condor after one of the nations to which it is native. The generic term Vultur is directly taken from the Latin vultur or voltur, which means &quot; vulture &quot;. [ Simpson D.P. Cassell&apos;s Latin Dictionary Cassell Ltd. 1979 5 London 883 0-304-52257-0 ] Its specific epithet is derived from a variant of the Greek word γρυπός (grupós, &quot; hook-nosed &quot; ). [ Liddell Henry George Robert Scott 1980 Greek-English Lexicon, Abridged Edition Oxford University Press Oxford 0-19-910207-4 ] The word condor itself is derived from the Quechua kuntur.

Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World Vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. { Sibley, Charles G. and Burt L.

In the north, its range begins in Venezuela and Colombia, where it is extremely rare, then continues south along the Andes in Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, through Bolivia and western Argentina to the Tierra del Fuego. In the early nineteenth century, the Andean Condor bred from western Venezuela to Tierra del Fuego, along the entire chain of the Andes, but its range has been greatly reduced due to human activity. Its habitat is mainly composed of open grasslands and alpine areas up to [ 5000 m ft on ] in elevation. It prefers relatively open, non-forested areas which allow it to spot carrion from the air, such as the páramo or rocky, mountainous areas in general. [ Habitat of the Andean Condor Cleveland Metroparks Zoo http://www.clemetzoo.com/rttw/condor/habitat.htm 2007-01-10 ] It occasionally ranges to lowlands in eastern Bolivia and southwestern Brazil, descends to lowland desert areas in Chile and Peru, and is found over southern-beech forests in Patagonia. [ Ecology and behavior ] { Colca Canyon in southern } { Peru } The condor soars with its wings held horizontally and its primary feather s bent upwards at the tips. The lack of a large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft. Charles Darwin commented on having watched them for half an hour without once observing a flap of their wings. [ Darwin Charles The Voyage of the Beagle P.F.

Andean Condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.

A cooling effect through evaporation has been proposed as a reason for this behaviour, but it makes no sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. [ Sibley, Charles G. and Jon E.

In inland areas, they prefer large carcasses, such as those of dead farm animals or wild deer, while their diet consists mainly of beached carcasses of marine mammals when near the coast. They will also raid the nests of smaller birds to feed on the eggs. [ Andean Condor (Vultur Gryphus) National Geographic http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/andean-condor.html 2007-01-10 ] Coastal areas provide a constant food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean Condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land.

The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species.

Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.
