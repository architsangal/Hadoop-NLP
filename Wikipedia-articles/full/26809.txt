The first game of the &apos;&apos;StarCraft&apos;&apos; series was released for Microsoft Windows on 31 March 1998. With more than 11 million copies sold worldwide as of February 2009, it is one of the best-selling games for the personal computer.

Work on the game started shortly after Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness s release in 1995. StarCraft debuted at the 1996 E3, where it was unfavourably compared to Warcraft II; as a result, the project was entirely overhauled and then showcased to public in early 1997, receiving a far more positive response. StarCraft has had its storyline adapted and expanded through a series of novels, the expansion pack StarCraft: Brood War and two authorized add-ons. The game&apos;s sequel, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, was released in July 2010, with a further expansion pack, StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, expected in 2012. [ http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6281119.html Next Starcraft II due early 2012? Thorsen, Tor GameSpot ] Set in the 26th century, the game revolves around three species fighting for dominance in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector : the Terrans, humans exiled from Earth skilled at adapting to any situation; the Zerg, a race of insectoid aliens in pursuit of genetic perfection, obsessed with assimilating other races; and the Protoss, a humanoid species with advanced technology and psionic abilities, attempting to preserve their civilization and strict philosophical way of living from the Zerg. The game has been praised for pioneering the use of unique factions in real-time strategy gameplay and for a compelling story. Many of the industry&apos;s journalists have praised StarCraft as one of the best and most important [ http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/110068/the-52-most-important-video-games-of-all-time-page-4-of-8/ The 52 Most Important Video Games GamePro 2008-05-21 http://web.archive.org/web/20080913085022/http%3A//www.gamepro.com/article/features/110068/the-52-most-important-video-games-of-all-time-page-4-of-8/ 2008-09-13 ] video games of all time, and for having raised the bar for developing real-time strategy games. StarCraft s multiplayer is particularly popular in South Korea, where players and teams participate in professional competitions, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised tournaments. [ Gameplay ] { isometric perspective } Blizzard Entertainment&apos;s use of three distinct races in StarCraft is widely credited with revolutionizing the real-time strategy genre. All units are unique to their respective races and while rough comparisons can be drawn between certain types of units in the technology tree, every unit performs differently and requires different tactics for a player to succeed. The enigmatic Protoss have access to powerful units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shield s and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy of the quality of their units over the quantity. [ http://uk.gamespot.com/features/starcraft_sg/protoss_units.html StarCraftStrategy Guide: The Protoss Conclave - Units and Structures Greg Kasavin GameSpot 2008-04-18 ] The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. [ http://uk.gamespot.com/features/starcraft_sg/zerg_units.html StarCraftStrategy Guide: The Zerg Swarm - Units and Structures Greg Kasavin GameSpot 2008-04-18 ] The Terrans provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible. They have access to a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery, such as tanks and nuclear weapons. [ http://uk.gamespot.com/features/starcraft_sg/race_overview.html StarCraftStrategy Guide: The Terran Dominion - Units and Structures Greg Kasavin GameSpot 2008-04-18 ] Although each race is unique in its composition, no race has an innate advantage over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same. The balance stays complete via infrequent patches (game updates) provided by Blizzard. [ http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId%3D21149 Blizzard Support: StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment 2008-01-16 2008-04-18 ] StarCraft features artificial intelligence which scales in difficulty, although the player cannot change the difficulty level in the single-player campaigns. Each campaign starts with enemy factions running easy AI modes, scaling through the course of the campaign to the hardest AI modes. In the level editor provided with the game, a designer has access to four levels of AI difficulties: &quot; easy &quot;, &quot; medium &quot;, &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; insane &quot;, each setting differing in the units and technologies allowed to an AI faction and the extent of the AI&apos;s tactical and strategic planning.

[ Resource management ] Each race relies on two resources to sustain their game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by building a refinery on top of a geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it.

[ Base construction ] Protoss and Zerg building construction is limited to specific locations: Protoss buildings need to be linked to a power grid while almost every Zerg structure must be placed on a carpet of biomass, called &quot; creep &quot;, that is produced by certain structures. Terran buildings are far less limited, with certain primary base structures possessing the ability to take off and fly slowly to a new location. Terran buildings, however, require the worker unit to continue construction on the building until it is completed. Also, once a Terran building has taken a certain amount of damage, it will catch fire and eventually burn to the ground without further enemy action, though this can be prevented by repairs performed by a worker unit. The Protoss, by contrast, only require a worker unit to begin the process of transporting a building to the theater of operations via warp, and their buildings&apos; shields (but not their structure) are regenerative. The Zerg worker unit physically transforms into the structure created, which is capable of slowly healing itself. [ Multiplayer ] Multiplayer on StarCraft is powered through Blizzard Entertainment&apos;s Battle.net Internet service. Through this, a maximum of eight players can compete in a variety of game modes, including simply destroying all other players on a level (which may be competitive, as in Ladder play, or non-ranked, as in melee play), to king of the hill and capture the flag objective-based games. In addition, the game incorporates a variety of specialized scenarios for different types of game, such as simulating a football game, using the Terran hoverbike unit to conduct a bike race, or hosting a Zerg hunting competition. StarCraft is also one of the few games that include a spawn installation, which allows for limited multiplayer. It must be installed from a disc, and requires a product key to work just as the full version does. However, one product key can support up to eight spawned installations with access to Battle.net. Limitations of a spawned installation include the inability to play single-player missions, create multiplayer games or use the campaign editor.

According to the story presented in the game&apos;s manual, the overpopulation of Earth in the early 21st century has caused the international government to exile undesirable elements of the human race, such as criminals, the cybernetically enhanced and genetic mutants to colonize the far reaches of the galaxy. [ Terran: History 26–28 Underwood, Peter Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris; Vaughn, Jeffrey StarCraft (manual) Blizzard Entertainment 1998 ] An attempt to colonize a nearby solar system goes wrong, resulting in humanity&apos;s arrival in the Koprulu Sector. In the distant Koprulu Sector of the galaxy, the exiles form several governments, but quickly fall into conflict with each other. One government, the Confederacy of Man, eventually emerges as the strongest faction, but its oppressive nature and brutal methods of suppressing dissidents stir up major rebel opposition in the form of a terrorist group called the Sons of Korhal. Just prior to the beginning of the game, in December 2499, an alien race possessing advanced technology and psionic power, the Protoss, makes first contact with humanity by destroying a Confederate colony world without any prior warning. Soon after this, the Terrans discover that a second alien race, the insectoid Zerg, has been stealthily infesting the surface of several of the Terran colonies, and that the Protoss are destroying the planets to prevent the Zerg from spreading. With the Confederacy threatened by two alien races and internal rebellion, it begins to crumble. [ Terran: History 30–33 Underwood, Peter Roper, Bill; Metzen, Chris; Vaughn, Jeffrey StarCraft (manual) Blizzard Entertainment 1998 ] [ Characters ] [ Characters of StarCraft ] The player assumes the role of three nameless characters over the course of the game. In the first act, the player acts as the Confederate magistrate of an outlying colony world of Mar Sara, threatened by both the Zerg and the Protoss, and is forced through events to join the rebel Sons of Korhal under its leader Arcturus Mengsk. Mengsk&apos;s campaign is accompanied by Jim Raynor, a morally conscious law enforcement officer from Mar Sara, and Sarah Kerrigan, a psychic assassin and Mengsk&apos;s second-in-command. The second episode of the game sees the player as a cerebrate, a commander within the Zerg Swarm. The player is ruled over by the Zerg Overmind, the manifestation of the collective consciousness of the Swarm and the game&apos;s primary antagonist, and is given advice from other cerebrates of higher rank and status while accomplishing the objectives of the Swarm. In the final part of StarCraft, the player is a newly appointed officer (called Executor) within the Protoss military, reporting to Aldaris, a representative of the Protoss government. Aldaris is at odds with the former occupant of the player&apos;s position, Tassadar, over his association with Zeratul, a member of the dark templar, a group considered heretical by the Protoss government.

The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and Jim Raynor are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara in the wake of the Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the Confederacy arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. [ StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment 1998 PC Episode I, mission 3: &quot; Desperate Alliance &quot; ] { Transcript } Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk&apos;s troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions.

Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the Terran population into the Terran Dominion, crowning himself as emperor. [ StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment 1998 PC Episode I, mission 10: &quot; The Hammer Falls &quot; ] { Transcript } The second campaign reveals that Kerrigan was not killed by the Zerg, but rather is captured and infested in an effort to incorporate her psionic traits into the Zerg gene pool. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered. [ StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment 1998 PC Episode II, mission 4: &quot; Agent of the Swarm &quot; ] { Transcript } Meanwhile, the Protoss commander Tassadar discovers that the Zerg&apos;s cerebrate s cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical dark templar. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate Zeratul, who assassinates one of the Zerg&apos;s cerebrates in their hive clusters on Char. [ StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment 1998 PC Episode II, mission 7: &quot; The Culling &quot; ] { Transcript } The cerebrate&apos;s death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the Zerg Overmind, allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, which the Overmind has been seeking for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar and despite heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to embed itself into the crust of the planet. [ StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment 1998 PC Episode II, mission 10: &quot; Full Circle &quot; ] { Transcript } The final episode of the game sees Aldaris and the Protoss government branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while on a mission to arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead. [ StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment 1998 PC Episode III, mission 5: &quot; Choosing Sides &quot; ] { Transcript } A Protoss civil war erupts, pitting Tassadar, Zeratul, and their allies against the Protoss establishment. The dark templar prove their worth when they use their energies to slay two more of the Zerg cerebrates on Aiur, and the Conclave reconciles with them. [ StarCraft Blizzard Entertainment 1998 PC Episode III, mission 9: &quot; Shadow Hunters &quot; ] { Transcript } Aided by Raynor&apos;s forces—who sided with Tassadar back on Char—the Protoss break through the Overmind&apos;s weakened defenses and destroy the Overmind&apos;s outer shell, but take heavy casualties in the process. Tassadar channels his own psionic energies in combination with those of the dark templar through the hull of his command ship and crashes it into the Overmind, sacrificing himself in order to destroy it.

Bill Roper, one of the game&apos;s producers, stated this would be a major departure from the Warcraft approach, comparing its two equal sides to those of chess and stating that StarCraft would allow players to &quot; develop very unique strategies based on which species [is being played], and will require [players] to think of different strategies to combat the other two species. &quot; [ http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starcraft/news.html?sid%3D2563222%26amp%3Bmode%3Dpreviews StarCraftPreview GameSpot Ron Dulin 1996-05-01 2008-04-18 ] In early 1997, the new version of StarCraft was unveiled, receiving a far more positive response.
