[ 1949 11 26 y ] { Dili, } { Portuguese Timor (now } { East Timor ) } { Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor } { Eduardo Mondlane University } Mari Bim Amude Alkatiri (born 26 November 1949) was the first Prime Minister of an internationally-recognized East Timor. He served from May 2002 until he resigned on 26 June 2006 following weeks of political unrest in the country. { Agence France-Presse (2006). East Timor PM quits. Retrieved June 26, 2006. } He is the Secretary-General of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN). He is Hadhrami Arab by ethnicity and comes from the Al-Kathiri tribe a branch of which was also the Royal family of Seiyun that is now part of Yemen. [ Life ] Alkatiri&apos;s ancestors were Hadhrami merchants who lived in Portuguese Timor, he was born in Dili, East Timor, and had 10 other siblings. He left East Timor in 1970 for post-secondary studies in Angola, returning to East Timor as one of the founders of FRETILIN, becoming its Minister for Political Affairs. Following FRETILIN&apos;s declaration of independence for the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on November 28, 1975, Alkatiri was sent overseas as part of a high-level diplomatic mission. After Indonesia invaded the nascent nation on December 7, 1975, Alkatiri and his colleagues were unable to return, and he established the headquarters of the FRETILIN External Delegation in Maputo, Mozambique. During the 24-year Indonesian occupation of East Timor, Alkatiri was a chartered surveyor (Angolan School of Geography), and lived in exile in Angola and Mozambique. He also studied law at Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique. Alkatiri was Senior Legal consultant, in a private law office in Maputo from 1992 to 1998, and consultant on Public International Law and Constitutional Law to the Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique from 1995 to 1998. On May 20, 2002, the United Nations Transitional Administration transferred sovereignty to the first elected Parliament and Government of East Timor. As Secretary-General of the FRETILIN Party, which had received a large majority of the vote in Parliamentary elections the previous August, Alkatiri was chosen as the first Prime Minister of the newly independent nation. In May 2006, his government faced near-civil war conditions when approximately half of the country&apos;s security forces rebelled amidst scenes of rioting and looting in the country&apos;s capital, Dili. On 21 June 2006, President Xanana Gusmão called for Alkatiri to resign or else he would, as allegations that Alkatiri had ordered a hit squad to threaten and kill his political opponents led to mass backlash. { ABC News Online (2006). Alkatiri&apos;s resignation &apos;would paralyse Govt&apos;. Retrieved June 25, 2006. } Senior members of the FRETILIN party met on June 25 to discuss Alkatiri&apos;s future as the Prime Minister, amidst a protest involving thousands of people calling for Alkatiri to resign instead of Gusmão. { Reuters (2006). East Timor ruling party meets to debate PM&apos;s future. Retrieved June 25, 2006. } The party agreed to keep Alkatiri as Prime Minister; Foreign and Interim Defence Minister José Ramos-Horta resigned immediately following this decision. { Associated Press (2006).

In announcing this he said, &quot; I declare I am ready to resign my position as prime minister of the government… so as to avoid the resignation of His Excellency the President of the Republic Xanana Gusmão. &quot; The &apos;hit squad&apos; accusations against Alkatiri were subsequently rejected by a UN Commission, which criticised Gusmão for making inflammatory statements during the crisis, and called Police Chief Paulo Martins&apos;s abandonment of his post a &apos;serious dereliction of duty&apos; { Report of the United Nations Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste, 2 October 2006, http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/COITimorLeste.pdf }. In the June 2007 parliamentary election, Alkatiri was re-elected to a seat in parliament; he was the second name on FRETILIN&apos;s candidate list, after party president Francisco &quot; Lu Olo &quot; Guterres. { &quot; National Provisional Results from the 30 June 2007 Parliamentary Elections &quot;, Comissão Nacional de Eleições Timor-Leste, July 9, 2007. } Alkatiri said on August 1, 2007 that he would be FRETILIN&apos;s candidate for prime minister, while criticizing the record of his rival for the position, Gusmão, who had left the presidency and was elected to parliament at the head of a new party, the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT). FRETILIN won more seats than any other party in parliament, including the CNRT, but a post-electoral coalition led by Gusmão holds a majority of seats. { &quot; East Timor&apos;s ousted prime minister wants his job back &quot;, Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), August 1, 2007. } In a statement, Alkatiri called for a national unity government comprising all parties elected to parliament, saying that this would bring stability. { &quot; Fretilin seeks &apos;inclusive&apos; E Timor govt &quot;, AAP (theage.com.au), August 2, 2007. } With the parties unable to reach an agreement to form a government together, President José Ramos-Horta announced on August 6 that he had decided that the CNRT-led coalition would form the government, with Gusmão at its head. Alkatiri denounced Ramos-Horta&apos;s decision as unconstitutional, and angry FRETILIN supporters reacted to Ramos-Horta&apos;s announcement with violent protests, although Alkatiri said that the party would fight the decision through legal means { &quot; Riots after Gusmao named E Timor PM &quot;, Al Jazeera, August 7, 2007. } and would encourage people to protest and practice civil disobedience. { Lindsay Murdoch, &quot; Fretilin threatens &apos;people-power&apos; coup &quot;, theage.com.au, August 9, 2007. } The party subsequently backed away from its threat of legal action. { &quot; Planned challenge to E Timor Govt dropped &quot;, AFP (abc.net.au), August 15, 2007. } Later in August, after Australian soldiers took FRETILIN flags during protests and allegedly desecrated them, Alkatiri accused the Australians of working against FRETILIN and intimidating it, and said that &quot; it would be better for Australian troops to just return home if they cannot be neutral &quot;. { Lindsay Murdoch, &quot; Defence Force apologises for soldiers&apos; desecration of Fretilin flag &quot;, The Sydney Morning Herald, August 21, 2007. } Mari Alkatiri is an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation [ Assessment ] Alkatiri has been described as a skillful negotiator and an economic nationalist who secured as larger portion of East Timor&apos;s share of the Timor Sea oil resources against Australia.
