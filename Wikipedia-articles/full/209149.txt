[ Interview Date: May 1993 http://www.sting.com/news/interview.php?uid%3D1527 ] Sting later said he was disconcerted by how many people think the song is more positive than it is. He insists it&apos;s about the obsession with a lost lover, the jealousy and surveillance that follows. &quot; One couple told me &apos;Oh we love that song; it was the main song played at our wedding!&apos; I thought, &apos;Well, good luck.&apos; &quot; { American Top 40 broadcast with Casey Kasem. } When asked why he appears angry in the music video Sting told BBC Radio 2, &quot; I think the song is very, very sinister and ugly and people have actually misinterpreted it as being a gentle, little love song. &quot; [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/indepth/everybreathyoutake.shtml Song Library: Every Breath You Take BBC Radio 2 2009-07-08 ] { (Spoken in the second Sting audio clip.) } According to the Back to Mono box-set book, &quot; Every Breath You Take &quot; is influenced by a Gene Pitney song titled &quot; Every Breath I Take &quot;. The song&apos;s structure is a variation on the Classical rondo form with its AABACABA structure, a form rarely found in modern popular music. The demo of the song was recorded in an eight track suite in North London&apos;s Utopia studios and featured Sting singing over a Hammond organ.

He was asked to put guitar onto a simple backing track of bass, drums, and a single vocal, with Sting offering no directive beyond &quot; make it your own. &quot; { Summers, Andy (2006). One Train Later: A Memoir, Thomas Dunne Books, pp. 323-324. } The recording process was fraught with difficulties as personal tensions between the band members, particularly Sting and Stewart Copeland, came to the fore. Producer Hugh Padgham claimed that by the time of the recording sessions, Sting and Copeland &quot; hated each other &quot;, with verbal and physical fights in the studio common. The tensions almost led to the recording sessions being cancelled until a meeting involving the band and the group&apos;s manager, Miles Copeland, resulted in an agreement to continue. The drum track was largely created through separate overdubs of each percussive instrument, with the main backbeat created by simultaneously playing a snare and a gong drum. Keyboard parts were added from Roland guitar synthesisers, a Prophet-5 and an Oberheim synthesiser. The single-note piano in the middle eight was recommended by Padgham, inspired by similar work that he had done with the group XTC.
