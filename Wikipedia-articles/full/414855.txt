[ January 2012 ] Halal ( [ حلال ] [ ar DIN ḥalāl ], &quot; permissible &quot; ) is a term designating any object or an action which is permissible to use or engage in, according to Islamic law. The term is used to designate food seen as permissible according to Islamic law. The opposite of this word is haraam. [ Food ] The terms halal and haraam are applied to many facets of life; and one of the most common uses of these terms is in reference to meat products, food contact materials, and pharmaceuticals.In Islam there are many things that are clearly halal or haraam. There are also items which are not as clear, and for which further information is needed. Items that are not clear are called mashbooh, which means &quot; questionable. &quot; &apos;Halal&apos; means permissible. &apos;Haraam&apos; means forbidden. In Islam, other forbidden items include pork and all its products; &apos;animals improperly slaughtered&apos;; alcoholic drinks, carnivorous animals; birds of prey; and any food contaminated with any of these products. { &quot; Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America. &quot; 22 Nov 2010 } [ Dhabiha: method of slaughter ] [ Dhabihah ] [ ar DIN Ḏabīḥah ] ( [ ar ذَبِيْحَة ] ) is the prescribed method of slaughtering all animals excluding fish and most sea-life per Islamic law. This method of slaughtering animals consists of using a well sharpened knife to make a swift, deep incision that cuts the front of the throat, the carotid artery, wind pipe and jugular veins but leaves the spinal cord intact. { http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11375523 from BBC - Diners &apos;unknowingly eating Halal&apos; at Wembley - 20 September 2010 } The animal is then hung upside-down and left to exsanguinate. The head of an animal that is slaughtered using halal methods is aligned with the Qiblah. In addition to the direction, permitted animals should be slaughtered in the name of God. According to Amin Atta, one of central California’s largest Halal meat producers and former president of the Islamic Center of Central California (Masjid Fresno), the meat itself contains no blood clots within the veins—giving the meat a longer shelf life.  Atta adds, “Animals are consistently treated with mercy and respect and will be blessed with the name of God (Allah) prior to slaughter, according to Islamic Halal requirements”. { http://www.nevadahalal.com } [ Dietary laws ] [ Islamic dietary laws November 2010 ] Islam has laws regarding which foods can and cannot be eaten and also on the proper method of slaughtering an animal for consumption, known as dhabihah. However if there is no other food available then a Muslim is allowed to eat non-halal food. [ Islam Teach Yourself World Faiths Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood 2004 Hodder &amp; Stoughton London 978-0-340-60901-9 204 ] Surah 2:173 states: If one is forced because there is no other choice, neither craving nor transgressing, there is no sin on him. [ 5 5 ns ] [ Explicitly forbidden substances ] A variety of substances are considered as harmful (haraam) for humans to consume and, therefore, forbidden as per various Quranic verses: [ 2 173 ] Pork [ 2 173 ] Blood [ 2 173 ] [ 5 3 ] Animals slaughtered in the name of anyone but God. All that has been dedicated or offered in sacrifice to an idolatrous altar or saint or a person considered to be &quot; divine &quot; [ 2 173 ] Carrion (carcasses of dead animals) [ 5 3 ] An animal that has been strangled, beaten (to death), killed by a fall, gored (to death), savaged by a beast of prey (except by a human) [ 6 121 ] Food over which God&apos;s name is not pronounced (or at least not in a name other than God) [ 5 090 ] Alcohol These verses also have information regarding Halal foods: 2:173, 5:5, and 6:118-119, 121. [ Meat from Christians and Jews ] [ Islamic and Jewish dietary laws compared ] In Surah 5:5 of the Quran, it is written: &quot; The food of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] is lawful for you as your food is lawful for them. &quot; It should also be noted that the Quran does not prescribe any particular method of slaughter. Slaughter methods are attributed to non-Quranic sources. [ April 2012 ] [ In Non-Islamic countries ] { Hui Muslim population. } { dairy products by a German registered merchant } { chocolate. } In South Africa, most chicken products have a halal stamp. The South African National Halal Authority (SANHA) issues certificates and products bearing this logo range from water, snacks, and even meat-free products (which may contain non-halal ingredients). The South African National Halal Authority also licenses the usage of the Halal logo in restaurants where the food is halal but also no-alcohol or pork products can be served. { http://halal-hub.org/cert_body.php } [ October 2011 ] One of the first halal food companies in the USA is Midamar Corporation, established in 1974. It is also one of the first companies in the USA to sell USDA approved and Halal certified US protein products to the Middle East and South East Asia. The certification agency Islamic Services of America (ISA), was established in 2004 and located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Islamic Services of America certifications are recognized by some Islamic countries. Some questions have been raised about the authenticity and practices of ISA and Midamar. An investigative article documents the conflict of interest between ISA and Midamar. At least four members of the Midamar owner&apos;s family are on the board of directors of ISA. Midamar&apos;s vague differentiation on the slaughtering methods has also generated controversy. { Midamar--Some Revelations } In Dearborn, Michigan, the home of one of the largest Muslim and Arab populations in the United States, some fast food restaurant chains such as the McDonald&apos;s Corporation have introduced halal chicken nugget s. [ http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa072901a.htm Halal McNuggets a Hit in Detroit Christine Huda Dodge About.com 6 October 2011 ] In the United Kingdom, China, Malaysia or Singapore, halal fried chicken restaurants having thousands of outlets serve halal foods, such as the ChicKing Fried Chicken, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Brown&apos;s Chicken, and Crown Fried Chicken companies. As of February 2009, Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the U.K. began to sell halal meals in several restaurants. { http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1177969/Fast-food-chain-KFC-converts-London-restaurants-halal-menu.html } Also, in New York City there are numerous halal food cart s in business which serve gyros, chicken platters, and other halal fast foods, whereas in Europe, there are many of the Muslim-owned Döner kebab shops. { http://www.yelp.com/biz/53rd-and-6th-halal-cart-new-york#query:53rd%20and%206th%20food%20cart } A law passed by a county in Ohio in 2005 bans the sale, distribution, or production of food mislabeled &quot; halal, &quot; when county authorities determine that the food does not meet Islamic dietary standards. Similar laws protect kosher foods in most of the United States, and in many other countries, states, or provinces. { http://www.detnews.com/2005/religion/0508/05/B01-270537.html } McDonald&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken have been declared to be halal in Sri Lanka by the Jamiyathul Ulama, the only authority able to give out the certification there. { http://halaal.acju.net/home } In 2008 and 2009, twelve stores in the Mary Brown&apos;s chain in Ontario and Alberta became 100% halal. { Mary Brown&apos;s Website } [ http://www.marybrowns.com/halal.html ? ] Numerous halal meat markets also exist in Southern Ontario and Metro Vancouver. [ October 2011 ] Popeye&apos;s Chicken in Ontario is halal-certified, however, a legal dispute broke out between a group of 14 Muslim franchisees and the chain over the company&apos;s decision to use machine slaughtered birds. The 14 Toronto area outlets are instead using hand slaughtered halal birds and are suing the company so that they can continue to do so. [ Stone Laura Popeye&apos;s in fight over Halal chicken http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1080411--popeyes-in-fight-over-halal-chicken 7 January 2012 Toronto Star 2 November 2011 ] Thailand also has a noticeable population of Muslims and Halal-meat shops country-wide. [ October 2011 ] Within the People&apos;s Republic of China, which has a sizable Hui Muslim minority population, halal food is known as &quot; Qingzhen &quot; ( [ 清真 qīngzhēn pure truth ] ). Halal restaurants run by Hui Chinese resemble typical Chinese food, except that they do not serve pork. Dishes specific to Hui Chinese are known as Chinese Islamic cuisine. [ October 2011 ] [ Dhabiḥa ] Dhabiḥa is relatively difficult to adhere to in non-Muslim countries: [ October 2011 ] The abundance of pork and non-dhabiḥa meats at restaurants presents a rather difficult problem to overcome. While a Muslim will not order a non-halal dish, there is a concern about cross-contamination. This is likely to occur when the dhabiḥa halal dish is prepared with the same cooking tools and in the same kitchen as other non-dhabiḥa halal dishes. Food particles and juices from the two dishes are likely to be exchanged, technically rendering the dhabiḥa halal dish as haraam. Many apparently meat-free dishes, and even some desserts, contain pork, such as most kinds of gelatin, or other non-conforming substances. There is some disagreement about food additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) that may use enzymes derived from pig fat in the production process. It is difficult to avoid such additives when eating out since they are usually not listed on restaurant menus. Some Muslim organizations compile tables of such additives. Food additive numbers [ October 2011 ] Alcoholic beverages, including wine and whiskey, are used in many sauces and cakes, and alcohol is used as an ingredient (a solvent and a preservative ) for the production and storage of food flavorings such as vanilla and other extracts. Since the turn of the 21st century, there have been efforts to create organizations such as the Muslim Consumer Group that certify food products as halal for Muslim consumers. { http://halaladvocates.org/ } &quot; Halal &quot; is an Arabic word meaning &quot; lawful &quot; or &quot; permissible &quot;, and the term not only covers food and drink, but also to all matters of daily life. When it comes to halal food, most people think of meat foods only. However, Muslims must ensure that all foods, particularly processed foods, pharmaceuticals, and non-food items like cosmetics, are also halal. Frequently, these products contain animal by-products or other ingredients that are not permissible for Muslims to eat or use on their bodies. [ October 2011 ] The leading North America n halal food producer and distributor in the United States is the Midamar Corporation. Midamar is the first company in the USA to slaughter halal beef in USDA inspected plants. { Midamar Milestones } This company has been in operation since 1974, and it is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the home of the oldest mosque in the Americas still standing. The children of Muslims who settled in Iowa around 1900 discerned a need to start producing halal beef and chicken catering to the tastes of American Muslims. Since 1991, mainstream manufacturers of soups, grains, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, prepared foods, and other products, as well as hotel s, restaurants, airline s, hospital s, and other service providers have pursued the halal market. These companies purchase halal-certified products. Halal certification tells Muslims that their ingredients and production methods have been tested and declared permissible by a certification body. It also allows companies to export products to most Middle Eastern countries and South East Asian Countries. The oldest and most well-known halal certifier in the United States is called the &quot; Islamic Services of America &quot;. Something that companies which intend to export halal products must keep in mind, when choosing a certifier, is whether or not the certifier is recognized by foreign governmental bodies. [ http://isaiowa.org ? Islamic Services of America ] In 1986, the &quot; Islamic Meat &amp; Poultry Company &quot; was founded in Stockton, California. Islamic Meat &amp; Poultry is a halal-only, U.S. Department of Agriculture inspected, hand slaughtering and meat processing facility. This company follows the principles of slaughtering and meat processing according to the Islamic Shariah. In 2011, Halal Products Certification Institute was established in California and became the first worldwide corporation that certified halal consumer products such as cosmetics, personal care products and perfumes &amp; fragrances. The institute was established by Islamic intellectual scholars and Muslim scientists to assure the dissemination of halal consumer products. Also in Europe, several organizations have been created over the past 20 years in order to certify halal products. A survey recently published by a French association of Muslim Consumers (ASIDCOM) shows that the market of halal products has been developed in a chaotic way. The certification organizations do not have a common definition of &quot; halal &quot; nor agreed upon control procedures and traceability. The controls implemented by individual agencies are all very different: it can go from an annual audit of the slaughterhouse to checking each production with permanent controls in place.

Religious slaughter without stunning was prohibited in several countries in Europe from 1936 to 1944 under the occupation of Nazi Germany (Germany in 1936, Italy in 1938, then in the majority of the other European countries according to the Nazi Germany occupation progress between 1940 and 1944).

In 1978, a study incorporating EEG ( electroencephalograph ) with electrodes surgically implanted on the skull of 17 sheep and 15 calves, and conducted by Wilhelm Schulze et al. at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany concluded that &quot; the slaughter in the form of a ritual cut is, if carried out properly, painless in sheep and calves according to EEG recordings and the missing defensive actions &quot; (of the animals) and that &quot; For sheep, there were in part severe reactions both in bloodletting cut and the pain stimuli &quot; when captive bolt stunning (CBS) was used.

Dr. Schulze himself also warned in his report that the stunning technique may not have functioned properly.

FAWC argued that cattle required up to two minutes to bleed to death when such means are employed. The Chairperson of FAWC at the time, Judy MacArthur Clark, added, &quot; this is a major incision into the animal and to say that it doesn&apos;t suffer is quite ridiculous. &quot; Halal and kosher butchers deny that their method of killing animals is cruel and expressed anger over the FAWC recommendation. Majid Katme of the Muslim Council of Britain also disagreed, stating that &quot; it&apos;s a sudden and quick haemorrhage. A quick loss of blood pressure and the brain is instantaneously starved of blood and there is no time to start feeling any pain. &quot; In April 2008, the Food and Farming minister in the UK, Lord Rooker, stated that halal and kosher meat should be labeled when it is put on sale, so that members of the public can decide whether or not they want to buy food from animals that have been bled to death. He was quoted as saying, &quot; I object to the method of slaughter... my choice as a customer is that I would want to buy meat that has been looked after, and slaughtered in the most humane way possible. &quot; The RSPCA supported Lord Rooker&apos;s views. &quot; { &quot; CIWF Halal and kosher meat should not be slipped in to food chain, says minister } The same years, the French Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fishing has published ASIDCOM’s Bibliographical Report on Religious Slaughter and the Welfare of Animals, as a contribution within the framework of a meeting on animals and society organized in the first half of the year 2008. { Contribution of the meeting on animals and society (Meeting organised in 2008 by the French Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fishing) } This report quotes scientific papers and French veterinary PhD which support the equality or even possible superiority of religious slaughter to other methods of slaughter.
