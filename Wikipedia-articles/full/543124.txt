[ April 2010 ] [ 1945 04 3 ] { Montreal, } { QC, } { CAN } { 1965 } { 1979 } { 1984 } Bernard Marcel &quot; Bernie &quot; Parent (born April 3, 1945) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played 13 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers, Boston Bruins, and Toronto Maple Leafs, and also spent one season in the World Hockey Association (WHA) with the Philadelphia Blazers. During the 1973–74 and 1974–75 seasons, in what many consider the finest consecutive seasons ever by a goaltender, [ Jim Jackson (sportscaster) Jim Jackson Walking Together Forever: The Broad Street Bullies, Then and Now Sports Publishing L.L.C. 37 ] the Flyers won two Stanley Cup s and Parent won the Vezina Trophy and Conn Smythe Trophy both seasons. A 1984 inductee into the Hockey Hall of Fame, Parent was rated number 63 on The Hockey News &apos; list of The Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time in 1998. [ Steve Dryden The Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time 1998 ] [ Early years ] Parent&apos;s hero as a young boy was Montreal Canadiens goalie Jacques Plante, whose sister lived in Parent&apos;s neighborhood. Many times Parent watched out for Plante&apos;s visits to his sister and her family. As a Québécois, Parent&apos;s use of English was a never ending source of locker room and bus trip humor, especially when he was excited. During his early playing career, Parent did not conduct interviews in English for fear of saying the wrong things. [ Playing career ] Parent played for the Niagara Falls Flyers of the OHA Junior A league. A two-time winner of the Dave Pinkney trophy (lowest goals against average or GAA), he wrapped up his junior career on the team that won the OHA championship and the Memorial Cup championship in 1965. Parent began his career with the Boston Bruins in the 1965–66 season, appearing in 39 games. The following season was split between Boston and the Bruins&apos; farm club in Oklahoma. Left unprotected for the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft, Parent was chosen by the Philadelphia Flyers where he and Doug Favell, another former Bruin prospect, split the netminding duties for the Flyers&apos; first season. Parent recorded a 2.48 GAA with four shutouts and the Flyers finished first in the NHL&apos;s West Division. Over the next two seasons, with Favell performing inconsistently or injured, Parent became the Flyers&apos; #1 goalie and appeared in 58 and 62 games for the Flyers. Looking for help up front to improve the club&apos;s offence, the Flyers dealt Parent to the Toronto Maple Leafs on February 1, 1971. The trade turned out to be a positive turn for Parent. In Toronto, Parent joined his boyhood hero, Jacques Plante, who at 42 was having an all-star season. Under Plante&apos;s tutelage, Parent became a more consistent and technically proficient goalie. Parent played well for the Leafs through the 1971–72 season, gaining valuable regular season and playoff experience. Without a contract with the Leafs for the 1972-73 season, Parent signed a large contract with the Miami Screaming Eagles of the newly forming World Hockey Association. He was the first NHL player to jump to the new league. The Eagles did not materialize as planned, and instead became the Philadelphia Blazers. Parent faced a barrage of shots in 63 regular season games for the Blazers in the defensively weak league. After leaving the team over a contract dispute during the 1973 WHA playoffs, he sought a return to the NHL but did not wish to return to the Leafs. Toronto traded Parent&apos;s NHL rights back to the Flyers for Favell and a first round pick in that summer&apos;s (1973) amateur draft. The next two seasons were the greatest of his career. Playing 73 games in a 78 game schedule, Parent sparkled in leading the league with a 1.89 GAA and 12 shutouts. He shared the Vezina Trophy with Chicago&apos;s Tony Esposito and was named a first team all-star as the Flyers to a first place finish in the West Division. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoff MVP) and the Flyers won the first of consecutive Stanley Cup Championships. The following year, he won another Vezina Trophy, a second Conn Smythe Trophy and the Stanley Cup. &quot; Only the Lord saves more than Bernie Parent &quot; became a catch-phrase and bumper sticker in Philadelphia in those years. Following the championship seasons, Parent was sidelined by injury and appeared in only 11 games in 1975–76. Over the next three seasons, he experienced difficulties at times. Plante, although in retirement, continued to have a strong influence on Parent&apos;s career. Parent, like Plante, was a stand-up type goalie. At one point Parent was playing poorly and considering retirement. Plante watched him practice in Philadelphia for two days, then told Parent exactly what he was doing wrong: sitting back on his heels, backing into his crease and losing concentration. Parent heeded Plante&apos;s advice and returned to form. On February 17th 1979, Parent suffered a career-ending eye injury in a game against the New York Rangers. An errant stick entered the right eye hole of his mask, causing permanent damage to his vision. After hospitalization, including the complete loss of sight for two weeks, Parent recovered and eventually regained sight, although not at the level required to resume his playing career. This incident, as well as the ending of Gerry Desjardin&apos;s career when a puck struck his eye in 1977, lead many NHL goalies to switch from fibreglass facemasks toward the cage and helmet style, and resulted in many amateur and junior leagues banning fibreglass masks altogether, mandating the helmet/cage combo. [ Post-career ] After Parent&apos;s retirement, the Flyers retired his jersey number (1) in his honor. He spent several years in the Flyers organization as goaltending coach, mentoring future Vezina-winning goalies Ron Hextall and the late Pelle Lindbergh, the latter of whom idolized Parent as a youngster in his native Sweden. Today, he is employed by the Flyers as Ambassador of Hockey. He can be seen at Flyers home games on the concourse. Parent was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1984. In 1998, he was ranked number 63 on &apos;&apos;The Hockey News&apos;&apos;&apos; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. Parent has been a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
