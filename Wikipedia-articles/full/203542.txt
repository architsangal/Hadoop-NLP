There are 106 symphonies by the classical composer Joseph Haydn. Of these, 104 have numbers associated with them which were originally assigned by Eusebius Mandyczewski in 1908 in the chronological order that was known at the time. { Ethan Haimo, &quot; Haydn&apos;s symphonic forms: essays in compositional logic &quot;, } { Oxford University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-19-816392-4, ISBN 978-0-19-816392-3. } In the subsequent decades, numerous inaccuracies in the chronology (especially in the lower numbers) were found, but the Mandyczewski numbers were so widely used that when Anthony van Hoboken compiled his catalogue of Haydn&apos;s works, he incorporated the Mandyczewski number into Catalogue I (e.g., Symphony No. 34 is listed as Hob. I/34). Also in that time period, two additional symphonies were discovered (which were assigned non-Mandyczewskian letters &apos;&apos;A&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;B&apos;&apos; ) bringing the total to 106. [ The symphonies ] Symphony No. 82 in C major, The Bear ( 1786 ) Symphony No. 83 in G minor, The Hen ( 1785 ) Symphony No. 84 in E-flat major, In nomine Domini (1786) Symphony No. 85 in B-flat major, La Reine ( &quot; The Queen &quot; ) (1785?)

I): Hob. I/105 in B-flat major, better known as the Sinfonia Concertante for violin, cello, oboe and bassoon ( 1792 ) Hob. I/106, for which only one part has survived ( 1769 ?) Hob. I/107 in B-flat major, often known not by a number but as &apos;&apos;Symphony A&apos;&apos; (composed by 1762 ) Hob. I/108 in B-flat major, often known not by a number but as &apos;&apos;Symphony B&apos;&apos; (composed by 1765 ) Hob. I/105 is not really a symphony, but a sinfonia concertante, and as No. 106 has not survived to the present day, the number of &quot; symphonies &quot; by Haydn is usually assumed to be 106. { Oxford Composer Companions: Haydn, ed. David Wyn Jones, } { Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 381. ISBN 0-19-866216-5 } [ Complete recordings ] Four conductors have recorded the complete symphonies of Joseph Haydn. The first to complete the recording project was the Austrian conductor Ernst Märzendorfer, who recorded them with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra. However, this set of recordings had a very limited release and remains largely unknown. Music Web International The first to make a complete recording that was widely available was the Hungarian-British conductor Antal Doráti, with the Philharmonia Hungarica. Hungarian conductor Ádám Fischer recorded a complete cycle in the late 1990s with the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra. In 2009, American conductor Dennis Russell Davies completed a cycle with the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra. http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article6949003.ece Christopher Hogwood was to have recorded a complete cycle of Haydn symphonies with The Academy of Ancient Music for Decca&apos;s L&apos;Oiseau Lyre imprint in a total of 15 volumes, each containing 3 CDs. Between 1990 and 2000, a total of 10 of these volumes were commercially released; these volumes contain Nos. 1-75, plus the two early symphonies numbered 107 and 108, and are presented in a theoretical chronological order rather than numerical order. (The program booklets contained in each of these 10 volumes contain a concordance to the complete contents of the 15 volumes.) Prior to the commencement of this project, Hogwood and the AAM had recorded several of Haydn&apos;s later symphonies for L&apos;Oiseau Lyre, which were released on LP. These earlier recordings were never re-issued on CD, the remaining five volumes of the series were never released, and the L&apos;Oiseau Lyre imprint was discontinued. Another attempt at a complete Haydn cycle on period instruments begun around this time, by the Hanover Band led by Roy Goodman for Nimbus, was also never completed.
