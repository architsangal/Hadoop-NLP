[ Local Polytechnics In Singapore ] Polytechnics in Singapore provide three-year diploma courses and accept students based on their GCE O-level, GCE A-level or Institute of Technical Education (ITE) results. Polytechnics offer a wide range of courses in various fields, including engineering, business studies, accountancy, tourism and hospitality management, mass communications, digital media,humanities, social sciences and biotechnology. There are also specialised courses such as marine engineering, nautical studies, nursing, aviation management, social enterprise and optometry. They provide a more industry-oriented education as an alternative to junior colleges for post-secondary studies. About 40% of each Primary 1 cohort will enrol in polytechnics. Polytechnic graduates with good grades can continue to pursue further tertiary education at local and many overseas universities, notably those in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and be exempted for modules completed in their polytechnics.

For example, Ngee Ann Polytechnic has engaged Chapman University in the United States to provide a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Producing for graduates of the School&apos;s Film and Media Studies department. Likewise, Nanyang Polytechnic has tied up with the University of Stirling in Scotland to provide a course in retail marketing.
