It is also used off-label for a variety of indications, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, phantom limb syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, neuromyotonia, intermittent explosive disorder, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. It has been seen as safe for pregnant women to use carbamazepine as a mood stabilizer, { Gelder, M., Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. Psychiatry. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp250. } but, like other anticonvulsants, intrauterine exposure is associated with spina bifida [ Jentink J Dolk, H, Loane, MA, Morris, JK, Wellesley, D, Garne, E, de Jong-van den Berg, L, EUROCAT Antiepileptic Study Working, Group Intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine and specific congenital malformations: systematic review and case-control study BMJ (Clinical research ed.) 2010-12-02 341 c6581 10.1136/bmj.c6581 21127116 2996546 ] and neurodevelopmental problems.

[ Carbamazepine http://www.drugs.com/monograph/carbamazepine.html The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 3 April 2011 ] It may be used as a second line treatment for bipolar disorder and along with antipsychotic agents in schizophrenia. In the United States, the FDA -approved indications are epilepsy (including partial seizure s and tonic-clonic seizure s ), trigeminal neuralgia, and manic and mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder. Although data are still lacking, carbamazepine appears to be as effective and safe as lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder, both in the acute and maintenance phase.

Carbamazepine preparations typically greatly decrease a person&apos;s alcohol tolerance. Less common side-effects may include cardiac arrhythmias, blurry or double vision and/or the temporary loss of blood cell s or platelet s and in rare cases can cause aplastic anemia. With normal use, small reductions in white cell count and serum sodium are common; however, in rare cases, the loss of platelets may become life-threatening. In this case a doctor may recommend frequent blood tests during the first few months of use, followed by three to four tests per year for established patients. Additionally, carbamazepine may possibly exacerbate preexisting cases of hypothyroidism, so yearly thyroid function tests are advisable for persons taking the drug. There are also rare reports of an auditory side-effect for carbamazepine use, whereby patients perceive sounds about a semitone lower than previously.

Carbamazepine may cause Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), since it both increases the release and potentiates the action of ADH ( vasopressin ). Carbamazepine may aggravate juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, so it is important to uncover any history of jerking, especially in the morning, before starting the drug. It may also aggravate other types of generalized seizure disorder, particularly absence seizures.

This allele occurs almost exclusively in patients with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians.

Drugs that decrease the metabolism of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin, [ Stafstrom CE, Nohria V, Loganbill H, Nahouraii R, Boustany RM, DeLong GR Erythromycin-induced carbamazepine toxicity: a continuing problem Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 149 1 99–101 1995 January 7827672 http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D7827672 http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvQB98w 2010-11-18 no ] cimetidine (Tagamet), propoxyphene (Darvon), and calcium channel blocker s. Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pill s and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. As a drug that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, it accelerates elimination of many benzodiazepines and decreases their action. [ Moody D Raymon LP, Mozayani A (eds.) Handbook of Drug Interactions: a Clinical and Forensic Guide Humana 2004 3–88 Drug interactions with benzodiazepines 1-58829-211-8 ] Valproic acid and valnoctamide both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide into inactive metabolites. [ Gonzalez Frank J. Robert H. Tukey Laurence Brunton, John Lazo, Keith Parker (eds.) Goodman &amp; Gilman&apos;s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 11th 2006 McGraw-Hill New York 978-0-07-142280-2 79 Drug Metabolism ] By inhibiting mEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a buildup of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion. Grapefruit juice raises the bioavailability of carbamazepine by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzymes in the gut wall and in the liver. [ Environmental impact ] Carbamazepine can enter the environment through discharge of wastewater, and has also been shown to persist and accumulate in the organic components of soil and sludge. [ Stamatelatou K, Frouda C, Fountoulakis MS, Drillia P, Kornaros M, Lyberatos G Pharmaceuticals and health care products in wastewater effluents: the example of carbamazepine Water Science Technology Water Supply 3 4 131–137 2003 January http://www.iwaponline.com/ws/00304/0131/003040131.pdf no ] As carbamazepine is an emerging contaminant, { i.e. one that is relatively new, and still unregulated in terms of its discharge to the environment } the effects of its bioaccumulation on other living creatures and plants are not well understood. [ Pharmacokinetics ] Carbamazepine exhibits autoinduction: it induces the expression of the hepatic microsomal enzyme system CYP3A4, which metabolizes carbamazepine itself. Upon initiation of carbamazepine therapy, concentrations are predictable and follow their respective baseline clearance/half-life values that have been established for the specific patient. However, after enough carbamazepine has been presented to the liver tissue, the CYP3A4 activity increases, speeding up drug clearance and shortening the half-life. Autoinduction will continue with subsequent increases in dose but will usually reach a plateau within 5–7 days of a maintenance dose. Increases in dose at a rate of 200  mg every 1–2 weeks may be required to achieve a stable seizure threshold. Stable carbamazepine concentrations occur usually within 2–3 weeks after initiation of therapy. [ Bauer Larry A. Applied Clinical Pharmacokinetics 2nd 2008 McGraw-Hill 978-0-8385-0388-1 ] [ Mechanism of action ] The mechanism of action of carbamazepine and its derivatives is relatively well understood. Voltage-gated sodium channel s are the molecular pores that allow brain cells ( neuron s ) to generate action potential s, the electrical events that allow neuron s to communicate over long distances. After the sodium channels open to start the action potential, they inactivate, in essence closing the channel. Carbamazepine stabilizes the inactivated state of sodium channels, meaning that fewer of these channels are available to subsequently open, making brain cells less excitable (less likely to fire).Carbamazepine has also been shown to potentiate GABA receptor s made up of alpha1, beta2, gamma2 subunits. { Granger, P. et al. Modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor by the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and phenytoin. Mol. Pharmacol. 47, 1189–1196 (1995). } [ History ] Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of Novartis ) in Basel, Switzerland, in 1953. [ Schindler W, Häfliger F Über Derivate des Iminodibenzyls Helvetica Chimica Acta 1954 37 2 472–83. 10.1002/hlca.19540370211 ] Schindler then synthesized the drug in 1960, before its anti-epileptic properties had been discovered. Carbamazepine was first marketed as a drug to treat trigeminal neuralgia (formerly known as tic douloureux) in 1962. It has been used as an anticonvulsant in the UK since 1965, and has been approved in the U.S. since 1974. In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka first used carbamazepine to control mania in patients refractory to antipsychotics ( Lithium was not available in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, did the same thing with success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the anti-aggression effects of this drug. Carbamazepine would be studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s. [ Okuma T, Kishimoto A A history of investigation on the mood stabilizing effect of carbamazepine in Japan Psychiatry Clin.
