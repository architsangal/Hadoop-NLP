A member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, it has successful breeding programs for California Condor s and Asian elephant s.

[ http://www.oregonzoo.org/about/thanks-you-better-zoo/you-and-new-zoo/birth-bond The birth of the bond Oregon Zoo April 11, 2012 ] It all began with two bears purchased by Richard Knight, one brown bear and one grizzly. { Goodall, Mary (March 16, 1958). &quot; ‘Patron Saint’ of Portland&apos;s Zoo Collected Animals, Birds at Drug Store Near Waterfront &quot;. The Sunday Oregonian, p. 41. } { &quot; More Attractions for the Menagerie: Two Bears to be Added to the Free Show on Morrison Street &quot;. The Morning Oregonian, May 17, 1888, p. 8. } A former seaman turned pharmacist, Knight began collecting animals from his seafaring friends. He kept his collection in the back of his drug store on Third &amp; Morrison streets. When caring for the animals became too large a responsibility he sought to sell them to the city of Portland. Instead of buying the animals, the city offered to give Knight two circus cages and allowed him to place the caged bears on the grounds of City Park (now called Washington Park). Care and feeding of the bears, however, still fell to the Knight family and friends. It wasn&apos;t long before Knight addressed the city council again regarding the bears. Just five months later, he offered to donate the bears, along with their cages, to the city. Portland City Council accepted his offer on November 7, 1888, and thus began the Portland Zoo. Located in Washington Park, it was sometimes referred to as the Washington Park Zoo. { &quot; Dock Boss Finds Office Occupied by Young Deer: Washington Park Zoo in Line for Another Pet, but Loses Out by Very Narrowest of Margins &quot;. The Morning Oregonian, June 28, 1928, p. 16. } { &quot; Zoo contest prize taken by old name. &quot; The Oregonian, October 2, 1976, p. 1. } By 1894 there were over 300 animals in the zoo’s collection. In 1925, the zoo moved to the site of the present Portland Japanese Garden, still within Washington Park. The zoo moved again in 1958–59 to its current site, designed by Lawrence, Tucker &amp; Wallmann. [ Snyder Eugene E.

At this time, the Portland Zoo Railway was constructed to connect the zoo to its former site in Washington Park and other attractions there. The zoo&apos;s move to the new, much larger site was made in stages, over more than a year, with the first animals being moved in spring 1958 and limited public access being opened in June 1958, one day after the first section of the Zoo Railway opened. { &quot; Many See Zoo, Train &quot;. The Oregonian, June 9, 1958, p. 15. } During the transition period the new zoo was only open on weekends, as most animals were still at the old site awaiting completion of their new enclosures. { &quot; Russian Bears Inspect New Home at Zoo &quot;. The Oregonian, August 8, 1958, p. 26. } However, the new railway operated six days a week until mid-September. Meanwhile, the old zoo remained in operation, but in May 1959 was restricted to pedestrian access only, closed to automobile access, for its last months of operation. { &quot; Zoo Opening Pushed Back 2 to 4 Weeks &quot;.

The Oregonian, November 4, 1959, p. 14. } { &quot; Move to New Zoo Set for Big Cats &quot;.

The Oregonian, October 10, 1959, p. 5. } The zoo became popular locally in 1953, when Rosy the Asian elephant was acquired. The zoo became world-famous in 1962 when the Asian elephant &quot; Packy &quot; was born. He was the first elephant born in the Western Hemisphere in 44 years and is (as of 2010) the tallest Asian elephant in the United States at 10.5  ft (3.2 m) tall. A total of 28 more calves have been born at the Oregon Zoo, including seven sired by Packy (two of which still live with him), making it the most successful zoo elephant breeding program in the world. On August 23, 2008, Rose-Tu, the granddaughter of the zoo&apos;s first elephant Rosy, gave birth to a son named Samudra. This makes Samudra the first third generation captive born elephant in North America. [ Free the elephants!

Later in 1976, MSD renamed the zoo the Washington Park Zoo after a naming contest. The railway was renamed the Washington Park and Zoo Railway two years later. The Metro Council changed the zoo&apos;s name from the Washington Park Zoo to the Oregon Zoo in April 1998.
