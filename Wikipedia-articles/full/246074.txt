[ Forecast (disambiguation) ] Forecasting is the process of making statements about events whose actual outcomes (typically) have not yet been observed. A commonplace example might be estimation of some variable of interest at some specified future date. Prediction is a similar, but more general term. Both might refer to formal statistical methods employing time series, cross-sectional or longitudinal data, or alternatively to less formal judgemental methods. In any case, the data must be up to date in order for the forecast to be as accurate as possible.

Green 2010 (last updated) ] Usage can differ between areas of application: for example in hydrology, the terms &quot; forecast &quot; and &quot; forecasting &quot; are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times, while the term &quot; prediction &quot; is used for more general estimates, such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period. Risk and uncertainty are central to forecasting and prediction; it is generally considered good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attaching to forecasts. Although quantitative analysis can be very precise, it is not always appropriate. Some experts in the field of forecasting have advised against the use of mean square error to compare forecasting methods.

Scott Armstrong and Fred Collopy International Journal of Forecasting 8 69–80 1992 ] [ Categories of forecasting methods ] [ Qualitative vs. quantitative methods ] Qualitative forecasting techniques are subjective, based on the opinion and judgment of consumers, experts; appropriate when past data is not available. It is usually applied to intermediate-long range decisions. Examples of qualitative forecasting methods are: [ May 2012 ] informed opinion and judgment, the Delphi method, market research, historical life-cycle analogy. Quantitative forecasting models are used to estimate future demands as a function of past data; appropriate when past data are available. The method is usually applied to short-intermediate range decisions. Examples of quantitative forecasting methods are: [ May 2012 ] last period demand, simple and weighted moving average s (N-Period), simple exponential smoothing, multiplicative seasonal indexes. [ Naïve approach ] Naïve forecasts are the most cost-effective and efficient objective forecasting model, and provide a benchmark against which more sophisticated models can be compared. For stable time series data, this approach says that the forecast for any period equals the previous period&apos;s actual value. [ Reference class forecasting ] Reference class forecasting was developed by Oxford professor Bent Flyvbjerg to eliminate or reduce bias in forecasting by focusing on distributional information about past, similar outcomes to that being forecasted. [ Flyvbjerg B. 2008 http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/bt/Documents/Curbing%20Optimism%20Bias%20and%20Strategic%20Misrepresentation.pdf Curbing Optimism Bias and Strategic Misrepresentation in Planning: Reference Class Forecasting in Practice European Planning Studies 16 1 3–21 ] Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize winner in economics, calls Flyvbjerg&apos;s counsel to use reference class forecasting to de-bias forecasts, &quot; the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting.” { Daniel Kahneman, 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), p. 251 } [ Time series methods ] Time series methods use historical data as the basis of estimating future outcomes. Moving average Weighted moving average Exponential smoothing Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) e.g. Box-Jenkins Extrapolation Linear prediction Trend estimation Growth curve [ Causal / econometric forecasting methods ] Some forecasting methods use the assumption that it is possible to identify the underlying factors that might influence the variable that is being forecast. For example, including information about weather conditions might improve the ability of a model to predict umbrella sales. This is a model of seasonality which shows a regular pattern of up and down fluctuations. In addition to weather, seasonality can also be due to holidays and customs such as predicting that sales in college football apparel will be higher during football season as opposed to the off season. [ Nahmias Steven Production and Operations Analysis 2009 ] Casual forecasting methods are also subject to the discretion of the forecaster. There are several informal methods which do not have strict algorithms, but rather modest and unstructured guidance. One can forecast based on, for example, linear relationships. If one variable is linearly related to the other for a long enough period of time, it may be beneficial to predict such a relationship in the future. This is quite different from the aforementioned model of seasonality whose graph would more closely resemble a sine or cosine wave. The most important factor when performing this operation is using concrete and substantiated data. Forecasting off of another forecast produces inconclusive and possibly erroneous results. Such methods include: Regression analysis includes a large group of methods that can be used to predict future values of a variable using information about other variables. These methods include both parametric (linear or non-linear) and non-parametric techniques.

Measures of aggregate error: Mean absolute error (MAE) \ MAE = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N} |E_t|}{N} Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) \ MAPE = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^N |\frac{E_t}{Y_t}|}{N} Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) \ MAD = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N} |E_t|}{N} Percent Mean Absolute Deviation (PMAD) \ PMAD = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N} |E_t|}{\sum_{t=1}^{N} |Y_t|} Mean squared error (MSE) \ MSE = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^N {E_t^2}}{N} Root Mean squared error (RMSE) \ RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^N {E_t^2}}{N}} Forecast skill (SS) \ SS = 1- \frac{MSE_{forecast}}{MSE_{ref}} Average of Errors (E) \ \bar{E}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N {e_i}}{N} Business forecasters and practitioners sometimes use different terminology in the industry. They refer to the PMAD as the MAPE, although they compute this as a volume weighted MAPE. [ May 2012 ] For more information see Calculating demand forecast accuracy. Reference class forecasting was developed to increase forecasting accuracy by framing the forecasting problem so as to take into account available distributional information. { Flyvbjerg, B.

The method uses forecasting to reduce the energy needed to heat the building, thus reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Forecasting is used in the practice of Customer Demand Planning in every day business forecasting for manufacturing companies. Forecasting has also been used to predict the development of conflict situations.

An important, albeit often ignored aspect of forecasting, is the relationship it holds with planning. Forecasting can be described as predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like. { http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/index.php?option=com_content &amp; task=view &amp; id=3 &amp; Itemid=3 } [ Structured analogies for forecasting Kesten C.

Accurate forecasting will help retailers reduce excess inventory and therefore increase profit margin. Studies have shown that extrapolations are the least accurate, while company earnings forecasts are the most reliable. Accurate forecasting will also help them meet consumer demand.

Extremely small errors in the initial input, such as temperatures and winds, within numerical models doubles every five days. [ Storm Watchers 222–224 2002 Cox, John D.
