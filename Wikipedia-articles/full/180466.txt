It was launched by Greek-Cypriot businessman Stelios Haji-Ioannou with two wet leased Boeing 737–200 aircraft, initially operating two routes: London Luton to Glasgow and Edinburgh. In April 1996, the first wholly owned aircraft was delivered to Easyjet, enabling its first international route, to Amsterdam.

In addition, EasyJet has been able to undertake the acquisition of several rival airliners. { Go Fly Boeing 737–300 in 2004 } In March 1998, EasyJet purchased a 40% stake in Swiss charter airline TEA Basle for a consideration of three million Swiss francs. The airline was renamed EasyJet Switzerland and commenced franchise services on 1 April 1999, having relocated its headquarters to Geneva International Airport. This was EasyJet&apos;s first new base outside the United Kingdom. On 16 May 2002, EasyJet announced its intention to purchase rival airline, London Stansted -based Go for £374  million. EasyJet inherited three new bases from Go, at Bristol Airport, East Midlands Airport and London Stansted Airport.

Both airlines have adapted this model for the European market through further cost-cutting measures such as not selling connecting flights or providing complimentary snacks on board. The key points of this business model are high aircraft utilisation, quick turnaround times, charging for extras (such as priority boarding, hold baggage and food) and keeping operating costs low.

Southwest have a fleet age of 14.1 years whereas EasyJet&apos;s fleet age is just 3.6 years. [ http://www.airfleets.net/ageflotte/EasyJet.htm EasyJet Fleet Age airfleets.net 5 October 2010 ] Initially, EasyJet&apos;s employment strategy was to maintain control with minimal union involvement. However in recent years, the airline has adopted a more committed approach with a strategy in place to accommodate unions. While the two airlines share a common business idea, EasyJet&apos;s strategy differs from Ryanair&apos;s in a number of areas. EasyJet flies mainly to primary airports in the cities that it serves, while Ryanair often chooses secondary airports to further reduce costs. For example, EasyJet flies to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Paris Orly, the primary airports in Paris, while Ryanair flies to the smaller Beauvais-Tillé Airport, a 75 minute bus journey from Paris. EasyJet also focuses on attracting business passengers by offering convenient services such as the &quot; Flexi fare &quot; which allows free of charge changes to the flight within a window, speedy boarding and a checked in bag. easyJet also gives passengers the option to transfer on to an earlier flight without charge on the return sector of their booking if there is seats available.

Its early advertising consisted of little more than the airline&apos;s telephone booking number painted in bright orange on the side of its aircraft. The Airline TV series created by LWT and filmed between 1999 and 2007 made EasyJet a household name in the United Kingdom. The series, while not always portraying EasyJet in a positive light, did much to promote the airline during this time. EasyJet has used a number of slogan s since its establishment including &quot; The Web&apos;s Favourite Airline &quot; (a reflection on the airline&apos;s cheeky and cheerful image), &quot; Come on, lets fly &quot; and &quot; To Fly, To Save &quot; (a cheeky take on British Airways&apos; slogan &quot; To Fly, To Serve &quot; ). Its current slogan is &quot; (something) by easyJet &quot; with &quot; europe by easyJet &quot; and &quot; business by easyJet &quot; being the most widely used. [ Environment ] [ EcoJet ] { Winglet on an } { Airbus A319-100 } In June 2007, EasyJet announced plans for construction of its own airliner, dubbed EcoJet. Featuring propfan engines, the EcoJet would feature an increase in fuel efficiency. It would be constructed with extensive use of carbon fibre composite material.

It works by reducing build-up of debris and reduces drag across the surface of the aircraft, thus reducing the fuel bill. It is estimated they could save 1–2% annually, equating to a £14  million reduction in fuel costs. The idea has already been used by US military aircraft and if successful EasyJet will apply the paint to its whole fleet.

[ Criticisms ] { Boarding an EasyJet } { Airbus A319 } EasyJet has also come under criticism in Germany for not observing European Union law on compensation (and assistance to passengers) in cases of denied boarding, delays or cancellations ( Regulation 261/2004 ). In the case of cancellation, passengers should be reimbursed within one week. In 2006, EasyJet did not always refund tickets in a timely fashion.

The figures used were not based on emissions produced by an EasyJet aircraft or emissions produced by EasyJet airline overall as the ad implied, and ASA declared that airline had broken advertising rules. The judgement follows the airline being reprimanded in April 2007 after it made comments that its aircraft created 30% less pollution per passenger than some of its rivals. [ Sweney Mark easyJet ads criticised over green claims The Guardian UK 2 July 2008 http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jul/02/advertising1 22 February 2009 ] [ Destinations ] European and North African destinations; focus cities indicated in grey [ EasyJet destinations ] EasyJet&apos;s five largest bases in order of size are Gatwick, Milan-Malpensa, London-Luton, London-Stansted and Bristol. Newcastle airport is currently the airline&apos;s smallest base with 3 aircraft but EasyJet still offers more flights and destinations from here than all the non-base airports it serves. EasyJet flies in a point to point model rather than the more traditional airline hub and spoke model where the passengers have to change aircraft in transit at a major airport. EasyJet prefers to fly to larger or primary airports usually close to major cities. For example EasyJet flies to the main Düsseldorf airport, instead of Weeze, the secondary airport serving Düsseldorf. Primary airports are not always close to the city they serve and in fact can be further than the city&apos;s minor airport, this is the case at Belfast, Gothenburg and Rome and in these cases, EasyJet still prefer to serve the major airport. EasyJet has 19 European &apos;bases&apos;. Despite EasyJet being a British airline, and having a significant presence there, it has a significant presence in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and many other European countries. The United Kingdom is its biggest market, containing the airlines largest base and nine others as well as a total of six other non-base airports. Its three largest British bases in order of size are London&apos;s Gatwick, Luton and Stansted airports. EasyJet&apos;s largest competitor is Ryanair, which unlike EasyJet has a focus on smaller or secondary airports and in recent years, has started targeting holiday makers. EasyJet focuses heavily on business passengers but operates a greater varierty of holiday destinations than Ryanair. However, EasyJet has a very low presence at holiday destinations like Greece with limted frequencies and only a small number of airports to fly from. Ryanair&apos;s is much higher, especially at all of the Canary Islands and some Greek Islands, in particular Kos and Rhodes. Ryanair often refers to EasyJet as a high fares airline but EasyJet often criticises Ryanair for its choice of airports.

Beginning in December 2006, the airline started to return the Boeing 737–700 aircraft to their lessors. The Belfast base was converted to an A319 operation; the conversion finished in March 2010 with a total of 6 A319 aircraft. EasyJet has returned all the Boeing 737 fleet by November 2011. Through the acquisition of GB Airways, EasyJet inherited nine Airbus A320 and six Airbus A321 aircraft. This gave the airline some time to evaluate the feasibility of operating these larger gauge aircraft. Based on this evaluation, EasyJet decided to swap 25 A319 orders for A320 in July 2008 and later remove the A321 aircraft from the fleet.

There is no incentive for travel agent s to sell EasyJet bookings because there is no commission, a standard practice for the low cost carriers. In December 1997, Russell Sheffield of Tableau, one of EasyJet&apos;s design and adverting agencies, suggested to Stelios Haji-Ioannou that he should consider trialling a website for direct bookings. Haji-Ioannou&apos;s reply was &quot; The Internet is for nerds, it will never make money for my business! &quot;. However Tony Anderson, EasyJet&apos;s marketing director, and Michael Coltman, EasyJet&apos;s business manager, saw the potential and approved a website trial involving putting a different telephone reservations number on the website, to track success. Once Haji-Ioannou saw the results he changed his mind, and EasyJet commissioned Tableau as partners to develop an e-commerce website capable of offering real-time online booking from April 1998—the first low cost carrier to do so in Europe.

A typical Airbus A319 carries approximately 140 passengers in a single class configuration, but as EasyJet does not serve meals on their shorter flights, the airline opted for smaller galleys and had a lavatory installed in unused space at the rear of the aircraft. The space saved by having smaller galleys allowed for the installation of 156 seats. Due to this seating arrangement, EasyJet&apos;s Airbus A319 aircraft have two pairs of overwing exits, instead of the standard one pair configuration found on most Airbus A319 aircraft, to satisfy safety requirements. EasyJet does not provide complimentary meals or beverages on board its flights (apart for some occasional charter flights operated by the airline). Passengers may purchase items on board from the &quot; EasyJet Bistro &quot; buy on board programme. { &quot; EasyJet Shop May 2008 &quot; EasyJet, Accessed 11 October 2008 p.26-27 } Products include sandwiches, toasted sandwiches, chocolate, snacks, hot drinks, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks. Onboard sales are an important part of the airline&apos;s ancillary revenue. EasyJet also sells gifts such as fragrances, cosmetics, gadgets and EasyJet-branded items onboard, as well as tickets for airport transfer services or train tickets. EasyJet had previously provided in-flight entertainment (IFE) on certain aircraft (the ex GB Airways fleet), using drop-down screens on some Airbus aircraft.
