In the context of an evolving information society, the term information ecology marks a connection between ecological ideas with the dynamics and properties of the increasingly dense, complex and important digital informational environment and has been gaining progressively wider acceptance in a growing number of disciplines. &quot; Information ecology &quot; often is used as metaphor, viewing the informational space as an ecosystem. Information ecology also makes a connection to the concept of collective intelligence and Knowledge ecology [ Pór 2000 ]. [ Language of ecology ] Information ecology draws on the language of ecology - habitat, species, evolution, ecosystem, niche, growth, equilibrium, etc. - to describe and analyze information systems from a perspective that considers the distribution and abundance of organism s, their relationships with each other, and how they influence and are influenced by their environment. The virtual lack of boundaries between information systems and the impact of information technology on economic, social and environmental activities frequently calls on an information ecologist to consider local information ecosystems in the context of larger systems, and of the evolution of global information ecosystems.

[ Networked information economy ] In The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, a book published in 2006 and available under a Creative Commons license on its own wikispace, [ Benkler Yochai Yochai Benkler The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Main_Page available under a Creative Commons ] Yochai Benkler provides an analytic framework for the emergence of the networked information economy that draws deeply on the language and perspectives of information ecology together with observations and analyses of high-visibility examples of successful peer production processes, citing Wikipedia as a prime example. Bonnie Nardi in one of her books, &quot; Information Ecologies: Using Technology with Heart, &quot; [ Nardi O’Day 1999 ] applies the ecology metaphor to local environments, such as libraries and schools, in preference to the more common metaphors for technology as tool, text, or system. [ In different domains / disciplines ] [ Knowledge management and computer science ] Information ecology was used as book title by Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak [ Davenport Prusak 1997 ], with a focus on the organization dimensions of information ecology. There was also an academic research project at DSTC called Information ecology, concerned with distributed information systems and online communities. [ Law ] Law schools represent another area where the phrase is gaining increasing acceptance, e.g.NYU Law School Conference Towards a Free Information Ecology { Conference A Free Information Ecology in the Digital Environment, New York University School of Law, March 31, 2000 to Sunday, April 2, 2000 } and a lecture series on Information ecology at Duke University Law School&apos;s Center for the Study of the Public Domain. [ Library science ] The field of library science has seen significant adoption of the term and librarians have been described by Bonnie Nardi as a &quot; keystone species in information ecology &quot;, { http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/archive/nardi.html } { http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/sfsla/bulletin/sepoct00/info_ecology.html } and references to information ecology range as far afield as the Collaborative Digital Reference Service of the Library of Congress, { http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/source/CDRS-KB-CNI.PPT } to children&apos;s library database administrator in Russia. [ Biology ] There has also been increasing use of &quot; information ecology &quot; as a concept among ecologists involved in digital mapping of botanical resources, including research by Zhang Xinshi at the Institute of Botany of the China Academy of Science; also see a presentation to the Information Ecology SIG at Yale University&apos;s Forestry School. { http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/files/dpu-pip/ien-iie.ppt } [ See also ] Collective intelligence Crowd psychology Diffusion of innovations Digital ecosystem Emergence Knowledge ecosystem Knowledge management Knowledge tagging Media ecology Noosphere Sociology of knowledge Territoriality (nonverbal communication) [ References ] [ harv Barlow John Perry 1994 The Economy of Ideas: Selling Wine Without Bottles on the Global Net Wired (magazine) 1994 March http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.03/economy.ideas_pr.html. ] [ harv Capurro Rafael 1990 Towards an Information Ecology Irene Wormell (Ed.): Information and Quality 288 Taylor Graham London http://www.capurro.de/nordinf.htm.
