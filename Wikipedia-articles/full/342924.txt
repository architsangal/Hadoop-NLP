Established in 1940 in Yan&apos;an (延安), the university used to be administered by the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND). After COSTIND was merged into the newly established Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in 2008, the university is now under the direct administration of the MIIT. BIT has been a tier-1 research university in China for more than 50 years. It is one of the first Chinese universities to run a graduate school and received privileged fund from the Chinese government in “the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Five Year Plan.” BIT is also one of the national “ Project 211 ” and “ Project 985 ” universities, which were given priority for development by the Chinese government, the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, the Ministry of Education (MOST) and the Beijing Municipal Government. BIT&apos;s strategic collaborators include eleven Chinese provinces and direct-controlled municipality, as well as forty city or county level governments. The university also has various cooperations with ninety higher education institutions in 29 countries, as well as over one hundred major domestic and international corporate enterprises. [ History ] [ Early history (1940-1952) ] BIT it is the first science and engineering university founded by the Chinese Communist Party. The predecessor of BIT is the Yan&apos;an Academy of Natural Sciences, which was founded in January 1940. In 1943, the Yan&apos;an Academy of Natural Sciences was merged into the Yan&apos;a University as the Yan&apos;an Academy of Natural Sciences (延安大學自然科學院). In January 1946 and January 1947, the academy merged with the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Industrial Vocational School (晉察冀邊區工業專門學校), and the Shanxi - Chahar - Hebei border Industrial Traffic College (晉察冀邊區工業交通學院), respectively. In 1948, the academy became part of the North China University as the School of Engineering. Several science and engineering departments of the Sino-French University (中法大學) were merged into the school in 1950. In 1951, the school was separated from the North China University. However, according to the discipline adjustments policy of the Chinese government, some departments were terminated and transferred to other universities. For example, the Biology Department was transferred to the China Agricultural University. Part of the Aerospace Science Department was transferred to support the newly founded Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In 1952, the school was renamed as the Beijing Institute of Technology. [ Milestone events after 1952 ] In 1959, BIT was designated by the Chinese government as one of the 16 national key universities, which were authorized to offer graduate degrees. In 1978, BIT was still designated as one of the 88 national key universities by the Chinese government, despite that most research was stopped during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. In 1984, BIT was chosen as one of the 25 national key universities to receive special supports from the Chinese government during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. In the same year, BIT was authorized as one of the first 22 Chinese universities to run graduate schools on trial. In 1988, the institution changed its Chinese name from &quot; Institute &quot; to &quot; University &quot;, while the English name remained unchanged. In 1991, BIT was chosen as one of the 14 national key universities to receive special supports from the Chinese government during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. In December 1995, BIT was ratified by the Chinese government as one of the 15 first-tier &quot; Project 211 &quot; universities. In 1996, BIT became one of the first 32 Chinese universities to officially run graduate schools. In the same year, BIT was designated as one of the 27 national key universities during the Ninth Five-Year Plan. In 1999, BIT&apos;s undergraduate education was evaluated as &quot; Excellent &quot; in the assessment organized by the Chinese Ministry of Education. In 2000, BIT was the 10th university to be admitted into &quot; Project 985 &quot;, which gave prioritized supports to selected universities to develop into top domestic universities with international fame. In the same year, BIT was also designated as one of the top 22 universities in the &quot; 21st Century Education Promotion &quot; plan during the Tenth Five-Year Plan.
