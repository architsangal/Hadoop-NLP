Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma (or &quot; Burkitt&apos;s tumor &quot;, Burkitt lymphoma or &quot; malignant lymphoma, Burkitt&apos;s type &quot; ) is a cancer of the lymphatic system (in particular, B lymphocytes ). It is named after Denis Parsons Burkitt, a surgeon who first described the disease in 1956 while working in equatorial Africa. [ synd 2511 ] [ Burkitt D A sarcoma involving the jaws in African children The British journal of surgery 46 197 218–23 1958 13628987 10.1002/bjs.18004619704 ] [ Classification ] Currently Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma can be divided into three main clinical variants: the endemic, the sporadic and the immunodeficiency-associated variants. The endemic variant occurs in equatorial Africa. It is the most common malignancy of children in this area. Children affected with the disease often also had chronic malaria, which is believed to have reduced resistance to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), allowing it to take hold. The disease characteristically involves the jaw or other facial bone, distal ileum, cecum, ovaries, kidney or the breast. The sporadic type of Burkitt lymphoma (also known as &quot; non-African &quot; ) is another form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma found outside of Africa. The tumor cells have a similar appearance to the cancer cells of classical African or endemic Burkitt lymphoma. Again it is believed that impaired immunity provides an opening for development of the Epstein-Barr virus. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes Burkitt&apos;s, accounts for 30-50% of childhood lymphoma. The jaw is less commonly involved, compared to the endemic variant. The ileo-cecal region is the common site of involvement. [ Bellan C, Lazzi S, De Falco G, Nyongo A, Giordano A, Leoncini L Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma: new insights into molecular pathogenesis J. Clin.

Burkitt lymphoma can be one of the diseases associated with the initial manifestation of AIDS. By morphology (i.e. microscopic appearance) or immunophenotype, it is almost impossible to differentiate these three clinical variants. Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma may demonstrate more plasmacytic appearance or more pleomorphism, but these features are not specific. [ Epidemiology ] Of all cancers involving the same class of blood cell, 2% of cases are Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma.

(Source: Modified from WHO Blue Book on Tumour of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. 2001, p. 2001.) ] [ Malignant B cell characteristics ] Normal B cells possess rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes and each isolated B-cell possesses a unique IgH gene rearrangement. Since Burkitt lymphoma and other B-cell lymphomas are a clonal proliferative process, all tumor cells from one patient are supposed to possess identical IgH genes. When the DNA of tumor cells is analyzed using electrophoresis, a clonal band can be demonstrated, since identical IgH genes will move to the same position. On the contrary, when a normal or reactive lymph node is analyzed using the same technique, a smear rather than a distinct band will be seen. This technique is useful since sometimes benign reactive processes (e.g. infectious mononucleosis) and malignant lymphoma can be difficult to distinguish. [ Microscopy ] { H &amp; E stain. } The tumor consists of sheets of a monotonous (i.e. similar in size and morphology) population of medium size lymphoid cells with high proliferative activity and apoptotic activity.

The old descriptive term of &quot; small non-cleaved cell &quot; is misleading. The tumor cells are mostly medium in size (i.e. tumor nuclei size similar to that of histiocytes or endothelial cells ). &quot; Small non-cleaved cells &quot; are compared to &quot; large non-cleaved cells &quot; of normal germinal center lymphocytes. Tumor cells possess small amount of basophilic cytoplasm. The cellular outline usually appears squared off. [ Immunohistochemistry ] The tumor cells in Burkitt lymphoma generally strongly express markers of B cell differentiation (CD20, CD22, CD19) as well as CD10, and BCL6. The tumour cells are generally negative for BCL2 and TdT. The high mitotic activity of Burkitt lymphoma is confirmed by nearly 100% of the cells staining positive for Ki67. [ 978-92-832-2431-0 ] [ Genetics ] All types of Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma are characterized by disregulation of the c-myc gene by one of three chromosomal translocations.

[ Liu D, Shimonov J, Primanneni S, Lai Y, Ahmed T, Seiter K t(8;14;18): a 3-way chromosome translocation in two patients with Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma/leukemia Mol. Cancer 6 35 2007 17547754 10.1186/1476-4598-6-35 1904237 ] The most common variant is t(8;14)(q24;q32), which accounts for approximately 85% of cases. This involves c-myc and IGH@. A variant of this, a three-way translocation, t(8;14;18), has also been identified. [ Smardova J, Grochova D, Fabian P, et al. An unusual p53 mutation detected in Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma: 30 bp duplication Oncol. Rep. 20 4 773–8 2008 October 18813817 http://www.spandidos-publications.com/or/article.jsp?article_id%3Dor_20_4_773 ] A rare variant is at t(2;8)(p12;q24). This involves IGK@ and c-myc. Another rare variant is t(8;22)(q24;q11). This involves IGL@ and c-myc. Combined, the two less-common translocations, t(2;8)(p12;q24) and t(8;22)(q24;q11), account for the remaining 15% of cases not due to the t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation. [ Treatment ] Treatment includes dose-adjusted EPOCH with Rituxan ( rituximab ). [ Wyndham H. Wilson, Kieron Dunleavy, Stefania Pittaluga, Upendra Hegde, Nicole Grant, Seth M. Steinberg, Mark Raffeld, Martin Gutierrez, Bruce A. Chabner, Louis Staudt, Elaine S. Jaffe, and John E.

With faster growing cancers, such as Burkitt&apos;s, the cancer actually responds faster than with slower growing cancers. This rapid response to chemotherapy can be hazardous to patient, as a phenomenon called &quot; tumor lysis syndrome &quot; could occur. Close monitoring of patient and adequate hydration is essential during the process. Chemotherapy [ Yustein JT, Dang CV Biology and treatment of Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma Curr. Opin.

[ Prognosis ] Treatment with dose-adjusted EPOCH with Rituxan ( rituximab ) has shown an 8 year survival rate of 91% for low risk, 90% for low-intermediate risk, 67% for high-intermediate risk, and 31% for high risk cases with few of the side effects associated with Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma chemotherapy.
