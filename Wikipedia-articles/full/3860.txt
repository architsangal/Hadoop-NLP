[ NLCS ] In Major League Baseball, the National League Championship Series (NLCS) is a round in the postseason that determines who wins the National League pennant and advances to Major League Baseball &apos;s championship, the World Series, facing the winner of the American League Championship Series. The reigning National League Champions are the St. Louis Cardinals. Prior to 1969, the National League champion (the &quot; pennant winner &quot; ) was determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season. There were four ad hoc three-game playoff series due to ties under this formulation (in 1946, 1951, 1959 and 1962 ). (The American League had to resolve a tie in 1948, but used a single-game playoff for that.) A structured postseason series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven. The NLCS and ALCS, since the expansion to best-of-seven, are always played in a 2–3–2 format: Since 1995, games 1, 2, 6 and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home field advantage, and Games 3, 4 and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. Home field advantage is given to the team that has the better record, with the exception that the team that made the postseason as the Wild Card team cannot get home field advantage. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage was alternated between divisions each year regardless of regular season record. In 1981, a divisional series was held due to a split season caused by a players&apos; strike. In 1994, the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, the National League Division Series (NLDS). The winners of that round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS. The NLDS was first played in 1995 due to the cancellation of the 1994 postseason during another players&apos; strike. Every team in the National League has appeared in the NLCS at least once. [ Championship Trophy ] The Warren C. Giles Trophy, named for the president of the NL from 1951 to 1969, is awarded to the NLCS winner. { http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20081016__Fantastic_feeling__for_Bill_Giles.html Mike Jensen, &quot; &apos;Fantastic feeling&apos; for Bill Giles, &quot; Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 16, 2008.

The MVP award has been given to a player on the losing team twice, in 1986 to Mike Scott of the Houston Astros and in 1987 to Jeff Leonard of the San Francisco Giants. Although the National League began its LCS MVP award in 1977, the American League did not begin its LCS MVP award until 1980. { League Championship Series Most Valuable Players (MLB.com/News/Awards/History/ ).
