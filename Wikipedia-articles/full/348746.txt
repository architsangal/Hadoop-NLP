[ Early life and education ] Kaku was born in San Jose, California to Japanese immigrant parents. His grandfather came to the United States to take part in the clean-up operation after the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake [ May 2011 ]. His father was born in California but was educated in Japan and spoke little English. Both his parents were put in the Tule Lake War Relocation Center, where they met and where his two brothers were born. At Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, Kaku assembled an atom smasher in his parents&apos; garage for a science fair project.

Kaku graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1968 and was first in his physics class. He attended the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley and received a Ph.D. in 1972, and in 1972 he held a lectureship at Princeton University. During the Vietnam War, Kaku completed his U.S. Army basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia and his advanced individual training at Fort Lewis, Washington.

Kaku defines the show as dealing with the general topics of science, war, peace, and the environment. In April 2006, Kaku began broadcasting Science Fantastic on 90 commercial radio stations, the only nationally syndicated science program on commercial radio in the United States. It is syndicated by Talk Radio Network and now reaches 130 radio stations and America&apos;s Talk on XM. The program is formatted as a live listener call-in show, focusing on &quot; futurology, &quot; which he defines as the future of science. [ April 2010 ] Featured guests include Nobel laureates and top researchers on the topics of string theory, time travel, black holes, gene therapy, aging, space travel, artificial intelligence, and SETI. When Kaku is busy filming for television, Science Fantastic goes on hiatus, sometimes for several months. Kaku is also a frequent guest on many programs, where he is outspoken in all areas and issues he considers of importance, such as the program Coast to Coast AM, where on 30 November 2007, he reaffirmed his belief that there is a 100% probability of extraterrestrial life in the universe.

It played theatrically in the United States, was later broadcast on national TV, and won several film awards. [ May 2011 ] In 2005, Kaku appeared in the short documentary Obsessed &amp; Scientific. The film is about the possibility of time travel and the people who dream about it. It screened at the Montreal World Film Festival and a feature film expansion is in development talks. Kaku also appeared in the ABC documentary UFOs: Seeing Is Believing, in which he suggested that while he believes it is extremely unlikely that extraterrestrials have ever actually visited Earth, we must keep our minds open to the possible existence of civilizations a million years ahead of us in technology, where entirely new avenues of physics open up. He also discussed the future of interstellar exploration and alien life in the Discovery Channel special Alien Planet as one of the multiple speakers who co-hosted the show, and Einstein&apos;s Theory of Relativity on The History Channel. In February 2006, Kaku appeared as presenter in the BBC-TV four-part documentary Time which seeks to explore the mysterious nature of time. Part one of the series concerns personal time, and how we perceive and measure the passing of time. The second in the series deals with cheating time, exploring possibilities of extending the lifespan of organisms. The geological time covered in part three explores the ages of the earth and the sun. Part four covers the topics of cosmological time, the beginning of time and the events that occurred at the instant of the big bang. On January 28, 2007, Kaku hosted the Discovery Channel series 2057. This three-hour program discussed how medicine, the city, and energy could change over the next 50 years. In 2008, Kaku hosted the three-hour BBC-TV documentary Visions of the Future, on the future of computers, medicine, and quantum physics, and he appeared in several episodes of the History Channel&apos;s Universe series. On December 1, 2009, he began hosting a 12-episode weekly TV series for the Science Channel at 10 pm, called Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible, based on his best-selling book. Each 30-minute episode discusses the scientific basis behind imaginative schemes, such as time travel, parallel universes, warp drive, star ships, light sabers, force fields, teleportation, invisibility, death stars, and even superpowers and flying saucers. Each episode includes interviews with the world&apos;s top scientists working on prototypes of these technologies, interviews with science fiction fans, clips from science fiction movies, and special effects and computer graphics. Although these inventions are impossible today, the series discusses when these technologies might become feasible in the future. { SCI-FI SCIENCE: Physics of the Impossible. } In 2010, he began to appear in a series on the website Gametrailers.com called Science of Games, discussing the scientific aspects of various popular video games such as Mass Effect 2 and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. Kaku is popular in mainstream media because of his knowledge and his accessible approach to presenting complex subjects in science. While his technical writings are confined to theoretical physics, his public speaking and media appearances cover a broad range of topics, from the Kardashev scale to more esoteric subjects such as wormhole s and time travel. In January 2007, Kaku visited Oman. While there, he talked at length to select members of that country&apos;s decision makers. In an interview with local media, Dr Kaku elaborated on his vision of mankind&apos;s future. Kaku considers climate change and terrorism as serious threats in man&apos;s evolution from a Type 0 civilization to Type 1.

[ http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vdkmj www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vdkmj ] [ Social policy advocacy ] Kaku has publicly stated his concerns over matters including the anthropogenic cause of global warming, nuclear armament, nuclear power and the general misuse of science. [ Kaku Michio Nuclear Threats and the New World Order CovertAction Quarterly 41 2 Summer 1992 http://www.ratical.org/radiation/inetSeries/NthrtsNnwo.html 2008-02-27 ] He was critical of the Cassini–Huygens space probe because of the [ 72 lb kg ] of plutonium contained in the craft for use by its radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Conscious of the possibility of casualties if the probe&apos;s fuel were dispersed into the environment during a malfunction and crash as the probe was making a &apos;sling-shot&apos; maneuver around earth, Kaku publicly criticized NASA&apos;s risk assessment. [ Kaku Michio A Scientific Critique of the Accident Risks from the Cassini Space Mission http://www.animatedsoftware.com/cassini/mk9708so.htm Animated Software Company 5 October 1997 2008-02-07 ] He has also spoken on the dangers of space junk and called for more and better monitoring. Kaku is generally a vigorous supporter of the exploration of outer space, believing that the ultimate destiny of the human race may lie in extrasolar planet s; but he is critical of some of the cost-ineffective missions and methods of NASA. Kaku credits his anti-nuclear war position to programs he heard on the Pacifica Radio network, during his student years in California. It was during this period that he made the decision to turn away from a career developing the next generation of nuclear weapons in association with Edward Teller and focused on research, teaching, writing and media. [ May 2011 ] Kaku joined with others such as Helen Caldicott, Jonathan Schell, Peace Action and was instrumental in building a global anti-nuclear weapons movement that arose in the 1980s, during the administration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Kaku was a board member of Peace Action and on the board of radio station WBAI-FM in New York City where he originated his long running program, Explorations, that focused on the issues of science, war, peace and the environment. His remark from an interview in support of SETI, &quot; We could be in the middle of an intergalactic conversation...and we wouldn&apos;t even know. &quot;, is used in the third Symphony of Science installment &quot; Our Place in the Cosmos &quot;.
