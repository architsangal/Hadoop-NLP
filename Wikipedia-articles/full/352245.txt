The community is part of a local type of government called a village as one of the communities making up the Villages at Mount Hood, which stretches from the border of Sandy to Government Camp. The community is named after the nearby Zigzag River, a tributary of the Sandy River, which is in turn a tributary of the Columbia River.

Lewis A. McArthur Lewis L. McArthur Oregon Geographic Names 1928 7th 2003 Oregon Historical Society Press Portland, Oregon 0-87595-277-1 ] He described the crossing in his journal: The manner of descending is to turn directly to the right, go zigzag for about one hundred yards, then turn short round, and go zigzag until you come under the place where you started from; then to the right, and so on, until you reach the base. The Zigzag River is no more crooked than adjoining streams, therefore the stream was most likely identified to fellow travelers on what was to become the Barlow Road by the manner of crossing and not for an especially irregular alignment. Zigzag post office was established in 1917; it ran intermittently until 1974. For a time the Zigzag post office was located in present-day Rhododendron. [ Historic structures ] The 1935 Zigzag Ranger Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
