[ Early life ] Born in Spokane, Washington, descended from ancestors who had originally settled in America in 1626, Barker&apos;s childhood was spent around Washington and Idaho. As a youth he had an interest in &quot; fairy stories, history and literature &quot; which would be further influenced by such films as The Thief of Bagdad; all of which helped to turn his casual &quot; wargames &quot; with toy soldiers more towards fantasy. From this his fictional lands of Tsolyanu and others, in what was later to become Tékumel, emerged and were embellished further in middle and high school years during which time he commenced construction of armies of hand-carved figures to represent his creations. Also at an early age, Barker&apos;s interest in languages was piqued by neighboring children of Basque origin who were able to exclude others from their secret conversations in their native tongue.

After six weeks, this was self-published in August 1974 as Empire of the Petal Throne and play commenced forthwith, including such occasional members as Dave Arneson - who singled-out Barker and Tekumel as being his favorite GM and roleplaying game, respectively - from early days. { http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/tekumel/message/24299 } [ Lischka Konrad Der vergessene Tolkien [The Forgotten Tolkien] Der Spiegel 2009-10-06 http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/spielzeug/0%2C1518%2C649336%2C00.html 2009-10-13 ] { (English translation) } [ Raymond Victor Dave Arneson and Tekumel http://sandboxofdoom.blogspot.com/2009/04/dave-arneson-and-tekumel.html 2009-04-11 2009-10-13 ] [ Interview with Dave Arneson Fight On! 2 63–64 Ignatius Umlaut Summer 2008 ] Once Gary Gygax &apos;s attention had been drawn to Barker&apos;s work, it was decided that TSR would publish a revised version of the game mechanics along with a condensed version of his campaign setting. In a Dragon Magazine editorial from December, 1976, editor Tim Kask drew comparisons between the world of Tékumel and J. R. R. Tolkien &apos;s Middle-earth not in terms of literature created, nor that his work was derivative of Tolkien&apos;s (being well-advanced by the time The Lord of the Rings was released), but rather regarding the in-depth detail in the setting, mythos and linguistic backgrounds and concluded that &quot; In terms of development of detail, I think EPT [Empire of the Petal Throne] has it over Middle Earth in the matters that most concern gamers &quot; since it had been developed by a &quot; wargamer &quot;, whereas Tolkien had no such background and having died prior to the release of D &amp; D was thus unable to address this new pastime personally.

The article quotes friends and acquaintances who posit that this may be, at least in part, due to the unfamiliarity of the setting [ Brady Patrick You’re not in Kansas anymore The Eye of All-Seeing Wonder 4 3 Dave Morris Spring 1995 http://www.tekumel.com/eoasw4_02.html 2009-10-14 ] compared with Western society, echoing Fine&apos;s observations from 1983, and possibly even that Tékumel was released to the gaming world too early on, when players had only just started to experiment with their own invented worlds rather than fitting their play into pre-configured, non-literary domains with novel backgrounds. In 2008, Barker founded the Tékumel Foundation along with many of his long-time players, to preserve and manage rights relating to his creations in future. Barker died in home hospice on March 16, 2012. He is survived by his wife, Ambereen. [ Gaming Giant M.A.R.
