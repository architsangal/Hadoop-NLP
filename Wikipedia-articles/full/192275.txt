Zanuck } Darryl Francis Zanuck (September 5, 1902 – December 22, 1979) was an American producer, writer, actor, director and studio executive who played a major part in the Hollywood studio system as one of its longest survivors (the length of his career being rivalled only by that of Adolph Zukor ). He earned three Academy Awards during his tenure. [ Early life ] Zanuck was born in Wahoo, Nebraska, the son of Louise (Torpin) and Frank Zanuck, who owned and operated a hotel in Wahoo. { http://www.wahooschools.org/vnews/display.v/SEC/Wahoo&apos;s%20Famous%20Sons%3E%3EDarryl%20Zanuck } Zanuck was of part Swiss descent and was raised a Protestant.

At eight, he found his first movie job as an extra, but his disapproving father recalled him to Nebraska. In 1918, despite being sixteen, he deceived a recruiter and joined the United States Army and served in France with the Nebraska National Guard. Returning to the U.S., he worked in many part-time jobs while he tried to find work as a writer. He managed to find work producing movie plots, selling his first story in 1922 to William Russell and his second to Irving Thalberg. Screenwriter Frederica Sagor Maas, then story editor at Universal Pictures&apos; New York office, stated that one of the stories Zanuck sent out to movie studios around this time was completely plagiarized from another author&apos;s work.

He moved into management in 1929 and became head of production in 1931. [ Studio head ] In 1933 he left Warners to found 20th Century Films with Joseph Schenck and William Goetz, releasing their material through United Artists. In 1935 they bought out Fox studios to become 20th Century Fox. Zanuck was vice-president of this new studio and took an interventionist approach, closely involved in editing and producing. Like the other heads of Hollywood studios, during the war he was commissioned a Colonel in the Army Signal Corps. He returned to Fox in 1944. In the 1950s, he withdrew from the studio to concentrate on independent producing in Europe. He left his wife, Virginia Fox, in 1956 and moved to Europe to concentrate on producing. Many of his later films were designed in part to promote the careers of his successive girlfriends, Bella Darvi, Irina Demick and Geneviève Gilles, and several movies he produced featured his girlfriend of moment, including the French singer Juliette Gréco. { Charlotte Mosley, editor, In Tearing Haste: Letters Between Deborah Devonshire and Patrick Leigh-Fermor, 2008, John Murray } He returned to control of Fox in 1962, replacing Spyros Skouras, in a confrontation over the release of Zanuck&apos;s production of The Longest Day as the studio struggled to finish the difficult production of Cleopatra. He made his son Richard D. Zanuck head of production. He became involved in a power struggle with the board and his son from around 1969. In May 1971 Zanuck was finally forced from &quot; his &quot; studio.
