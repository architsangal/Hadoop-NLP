[ April 2011 ] { English } { $28 million } { $102,356,381 } Dawn of the Dead is a 2004 horror film directed by Zack Snyder in his directorial debut. It is a remake of George A. Romero &apos;s 1978 film of the same name and stars Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber. The film depicts a handful of human survivors living in a Milwaukee, Wisconsin shopping mall surrounded by swarms of zombie s. The film was produced by Strike Entertainment in association with New Amsterdam Entertainment, released by Universal Pictures and with cameos from original cast members Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini. [ Plot ] After finishing a long shift as a nurse, Ana ( Sarah Polley ), returns to her suburban Milwaukee, Wisconsin neighborhood and to her husband, Luis ( Louis Ferreira ). Caught up in a scheduled date night and the two miss an emergency news bulletin on television. The next morning, Vivian ( Hannah Lochner ), their neighbor&apos;s daughter, enters their bedroom and kills Luis, who immediately reanimates as a zombie and attacks Ana. She flees in her car, but eventually crashes and is knocked unconscious after a bus driver attempts to hijack her car. A montage of news footage (set to Johnny Cash &apos;s &quot; The Man Comes Around &quot; ) depicts zombies overwhelming civilization around the world. Upon waking, Ana joins with Police Sergeant and former Marine Kenneth Hall ( Ving Rhames ), Michael ( Jake Weber ), Andre ( Mekhi Phifer ) and his pregnant wife, Luda ( Inna Korobkina ). The group breaks into a nearby mall where a zombified security guard (name later revealed as Ben Cozine) attacks Luda, who apparently escapes unharmed. They are also confronted by three living guards—C.J. ( Michael Kelly ), Bart (Michael Barry) and Terry ( Kevin Zegers )—who make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. The group secures the mall, then heads to the roof where they see another survivor, Andy ( Bruce Bohne ), who is stranded alone in his gun store, across the zombie-infested parking lot. The next day, a delivery truck carrying more survivors enters the lot, with zombies in close pursuit. C.J. wishes to turn them away but is outnumbered when Terry sides with the new arrivals. C.J. and Bart are disarmed while the newcomers go inside. They include Norma ( Jayne Eastwood ), Steve Marcus ( Ty Burrell ), Tucker ( Boyd Banks ), Monica ( Kim Poirier ), and Glen ( R.D. Reid ), as well as Frank ( Matt Frewer ) and his daughter, Nicole ( Lindy Booth ). Another woman ( Ermes Blarasin ) is severely bloated and too ill to walk; she is wheeled inside via wheelbarrow only to die and reanimate soon after. After she is killed, the group determines that the disease is passed by bites. Andre leaves to see Luda and the group realizes that Frank, who has been bitten, is a potential threat. After some debate, Frank elects to be isolated. When he dies and turns, Kenneth shoots him. Another montage shows the survivors passing time in the mall and various relationships developing, including Kenneth and Andy starting a friendship by way of messages written on a whiteboard and romantic feelings between Ana and Michael. When the power goes out, C.J., Bart, Michael, and Kenneth head to the parking garage to activate the emergency generator. They find a friendly dog but are attacked by zombies, who kill Bart. The remaining men are trapped in the generator compartment where they douse the zombies with gasoline and set them ablaze. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Luda did not escape unharmed when attacked by the security guard and has since entered the advanced stages of infection. She has been tied up to a bed by Andre, where she later goes into labor and dies. She reanimates and the baby is born. Norma checks on the couple and, seeing Luda is now a zombie, kills her. Andre snaps completely; they exchange gunfire, killing each other. The rest of the group arrives to find a zombie baby which they immediately kill. The remaining survivors decide to fight their way to the Milwaukee marina, and travel on Steve&apos;s yacht to an island in Lake Michigan. They begin retrofitting and reinforcing two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape. Andy is dying of starvation, so the group straps a pack of food and a walkie-talkie onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot. Andy calls for Chips, who is of no interest to the zombies, but one gets in the door of the store before Andy can close it. Nicole, worried about Chips, takes the delivery truck and crashes into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry and C.J. head through the sewers to mount a rescue. They reach the gun store, saving Nicole by killing Andy. They grab weapons and ammunition and go back to the mall; along the way, Tucker is killed after he falls into the sewer from the street, breaking both legs. Once inside they are unable to lock the door, forcing an immediate evacuation. Everyone piles into the buses and they navigate through the city. Glen loses control of a chainsaw, accidentally killing himself and Monica; blood splatters on the windshield causing Kenneth to crash the bus. A zombie attacks Steve as he tries to escape. C.J. exits the first van to look for crash survivors with Kenneth and Terry. They encounter the undead Steve but Ana kills him. She retrieves his boat keys, and they take the remaining bus to the marina. There, C.J. sacrifices himself after being unable to get out of the bus in time and blows it up so the rest of the group can escape. Michael reveals he was bitten while helping Ana to board the bus and, despite Ana&apos;s pleas, stays behind and kills himself, leaving Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, Terry and Chips as the only survivors. A montage of footage from a camcorder found on the boat begins with Steve&apos;s escapades before the outbreak, and concludes with the group running out of supplies before finally arriving at an island. They disembark and are attacked by another swarm of zombies. The film ends with the dropped camcorder recording dozens of zombies chasing them, leaving their fate unknown.

After he left the project to concentrate on Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, both Michael Tolkin and Scott Frank were brought in for rewrites. [ http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-critic-reviews/super.3/ Super: Critics&apos; Reviews James Rocchi MSN.com 2011-10-31 ] In a commentary track on the Ultimate Edition DVD for the original George A. Romero&apos;s Dawn of the Dead, Richard P. Rubinstein, producer of both the original and the remake, explained that Tolkin further developed the characters, while Frank provided some of the bigger and upbeat action sequences. The mall scenes of the film as well as the rooftop scenes were shot in the Thornhill Square Shopping Center in Thornhill, Ontario and the rest of the scenes were shot in the Aileen-Willowbrook Neighborhood of Thornhill, Ontario. The set for Ana and Louis&apos;s bedroom was constructed in a backroom of the mall. { DVD Commentary by director Snyder and producer Newman } The mall was defunct, which is the reason the production used it; the movie crew completely renovated the structure, and stocked it with fictitious stores after Starbucks and numerous other corporations refused to let their names be used (two exceptions to this are Roots and Panasonic ). Most of the mall was demolished shortly after the film was shot. The fictitious stores include a coffee shop called Hallowed Grounds (a lyric from Johnny Cash &apos;s song &quot; The Man Comes Around &quot;, which was used over the opening credits), and an upscale department store called Gaylen Ross (an in-joke reference to one of the stars of the original 1978 film). The first half of the film was shot almost entirely in chronological order, while the final sequences on the boat and island were shot much later and at a different location ( Universal Studios Hollywood ) than the rest of the movie, after preview audiences objected to the sudden ending of the original print. [ Deleted scenes ] Deleted scene s were added back for the &quot; Unrated Director&apos;s Cut &quot; DVD edition. Along with gore effects removed to obtain an MPAA R rating, { DVD-only introduction by director Snyder } they include a clearer depiction of how the survivors originally break into the mall, and a short scene where the character of Glen regales the imprisoned C.J. and Bart with his reminiscing about his bisexual coming-of-age. The DVD also offers, as a bonus feature, several more scenes which were not included in any version of the film, including an expanded version of the fictional live broadcasts shown in the mall&apos;s televisions, which chronicles the worldwide effects of the zombie plague, and alternate ending where Michael was never bitten and leaves with the rest of the survivors. [ Reception ] [ Critics Critical response ] In the UK, Dawn of the Dead and Shaun of the Dead were originally scheduled to be released the same week, but due to the similarity in the names of the two films and plot outline, UIP opted to push back Shaun release by two weeks. It was screened out of competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

It currently holds a &quot; Certified Fresh &quot; rating of 74% on Rotten Tomatoes; the site&apos;s consensus calls the film &quot; A kinetic, violent and surprisingly worthy remake of George Romero&apos;s horror classic that pays homage to the original while working on its own terms. &quot; [ http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dawn_of_the_dead/ Dawn of the Dead (2005) reviews Rotten Tomatoes 2009-06-16 ] Roger Ebert said the film &quot; works and it delivers just about what you expect when you buy your ticket &quot; but felt that it &quot; lacks the mordant humor of the Romero version &quot; and the &quot; plot flatlines compared to the 1979 version, which was trickier, wittier and smarter. &quot; [ http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F20040319%2FREVIEWS%2F403190301 Review Roger Ebert Chicago Sun-Times March 19, 2004 2007-06-15 ] George A. Romero said, &quot; It was better than I expected.... The first 15, 20 minutes were terrific, but it sort of lost its reason for being. It was more of a video game. I&apos;m not terrified of things running at me; it&apos;s like Space Invaders. There was nothing going on underneath. &quot; [ http://www.timeout.com/film/news/631.html Simon Pegg interviews George A Romero 2007-03-18 ] Bloody Disgusting ranked the film eighth in their list of the &apos;Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade&apos;, with the article saying &quot; Truly, you can analogize the two films [original and remake] based on their zombies alone – where Romero’s lumbered and took their time (in a good way), Snyder’s came at us, fast, with teeth bared like rabid dogs. &quot; [ http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18425 00&apos;s Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting&apos;s Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 3 Bloody Disgusting 2010-01-03 ] [ Box office ] The film grossed $59 million at the domestic box office, and over one hundred million dollars worldwide, [ Dawn of the Dead Box Office http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id%3Ddawnofthedead.htm 2012-02-26 ] and is one of the few zombie films to make over hundred million dollars at the international box office. [ http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id%3Ddawnofthedead.htm Dawn of the Dead (2005) 2008-06-16 ] [ Comparisons to the original ] In the original film, the zombie s moved very slowly and were most menacing when they collected in large groups. In the remake, the zombies are fast and agile. Many admirers of the original, as well as Romero himself, protested this change, feeling that it limited the impact of the undead. [ http://comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id%3D7973 John Leguizamo on Land of the Dead ComingSoon.net 2009-06-16 ] This is somewhat borne out by the fact that the remake has almost no close-up shots of zombies that last more than a second or two. Snyder mentions this in the commentary track of the remake&apos;s DVD, pointing out that they seem too human when the camera lingers upon them for longer. The original had a smaller cast than the remake, allowing more screen time for each character. Many fans and critics criticized the resulting loss of character development. [ http://www.pajiba.com/dawn-of-the-dead.htm Dawn of the Dead 2009-06-16 ] In the original version, the story unfolds over several months, indicated by the advancing stages of Fran&apos;s pregnancy. In the remake, the events transpire within approximately one month, as evidenced by the supplemental feature The Lost Tape: Andy&apos;s Terrifying Last Days Revealed, located on the DVD in the special features section. Another big change from the original is that unlike Romero, Snyder treats zombification more like a disease, pointing to the bites as the source, instead of anyone who is dead turning into a zombie. Three actors from the original film have cameos in the remake, appearing on the televisions the survivors watch: Ken Foree, who played Peter from the original, plays an evangelist who asserts that God is punishing mankind; Scott H. Reiniger, who played Roger in the original, plays an army general telling everyone to stay at home for safety and Tom Savini, who did the special effects for many of Romero&apos;s movies and played the motorcycle gang member Blades in the original Dawn of the Dead, plays the Monroeville Sheriff explaining the only way to kill the zombies is to &quot; shoot &apos;em in the head. &quot; Monroeville is also the location of the mall used in the 1978 film. In addition, a store shown in the mall is called &quot; Gaylen Ross &quot;, an obvious nod to actress Gaylen Ross, who played Francine in the original film. [ Sequel ] Zack Snyder stated that he would be only producing the sequel to his 2004 remake of George A. Romero &apos;s Dawn of the Dead instead of reprising his role as the director due to working on Watchmen when he announced this movie.
