[ Early life ] Pemberton was born to James Clifford Pemberton (born 1803 in North Carolina ) and Martha L. Gant (born 1803 in Virginia ), both of English descent. { Ancestry of John Pemberton } Though born in Knoxville, GA, Georgia, Pemberton, as a young child, moved with his family. { http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/PEMBERTON/2004-01/1073281384 } [ Invention of Coca-Cola ] In April 1865, Pemberton was wounded in the Battle of Columbus, Georgia, and like many wounded veterans, he became addicted to morphine. Searching for a cure for this addiction, he began experimenting with coca and coca wine s, eventually creating his own version of Vin Mariani, containing kola nut and damiana, which he called Pemberton&apos;s French Wine Coca. { Dominic Streatfeild, Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography, Macmillan (2003), p. 80. } { Richard Davenport-Hines, The Pursuit of Oblivion, Norton (2004), p. 152. } With public concern about drug addiction, depression and alcoholism among veterans, and &quot; neurasthenia &quot; among &quot; highly-strung &quot; Southern women, { John Shelton Reed, Minding The South, University of Missouri Press (2099), p.171. } his medicinal concoction was advertised as being particularly beneficial for &quot; ladies, and all those whose sedentary employment causes nervous prostration, irregularities of the stomach, bowels and kidneys, who require a nerve tonic and a pure, delightful diffusible stimulant. &quot; { Mark Pendergrast, For God, Country, and Coca-Cola: The Definitive History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company that Makes It, Basic Books: enlarged 2nd edition (2000), p.24. } In 1886, when Atlanta and Fulton County enacted temperance legislation, Pemberton found himself forced to produce a non-alcoholic alternative to his French Wine Coca. { Is This the Real Thing? Coca-Cola&apos;s Secret Formula &quot; Discovered &quot; } Pemberton relied on Atlanta druggist Willis Venable to test, and help him perfect, the recipe for the beverage, which recipe he formulated by trial and error. With Venable&apos;s assistance, Pemberton worked out a set of directions for its preparation that eventually included blending the base syrup with carbonated water by accident when trying to make another glass. Pemberton decided then to sell it as a fountain drink rather than a medicine. Frank Mason Robinson came up with the name &quot; Coca-Cola &quot; for the alliterative sound, which was popular among other wine medicines of the time. Although the name quite clearly refers to the two main ingredients, the controversy over its cocaine content would later prompt The Coca-Cola Company to state that the name was &quot; meaningless but fanciful. &quot; Robinson also hand wrote the Spencerian script on the bottles and ads. Pemberton also made many health claims for his product and marketed it as &quot; delicious, refreshing, exhilarating, invigorating &quot; and touted it as a &quot; valuable brain tonic &quot; that would cure headaches, relieve exhaustion and calm nerves. Asa Candler bought the business in 1887. In 1894, Coke was sold in bottles for the first time. During World War II, bottling plants were set up in Europe, Africa, and the Pacific islands. [ John Pemberton in popular culture ] The Fallout series of video games feature a beverage called Nuka-Cola, which is based on Coca-Cola. The inventor&apos;s name, John Caleb-Bradberton, is based on Pemberton. In 2010 the Coca-Cola Company paid tribute to Pemberton as a key character within an advertising campaign called &quot; Secret Formula &quot;. Centered on the secret ingredients of Coca-Cola, imagery related to Pemberton was used to make people more aware of Coke’s history and mythology. John Pemberton was also referenced in an installment of Futurama titled &quot; The Deep South. &quot; In May 2010, a Twitter account was created for John Pemberton, which was subsequently &quot; verified &quot; by the website. It is currently active and has more than 78,000 followers as of April 2012. { John Pemberton&apos;s &apos;Twitter account&apos; } Spotify { Spotify } is partnered with Coca-Cola, and they produced an ad together using John Pemberton&apos;s voice.
