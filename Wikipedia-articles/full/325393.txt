Originally commissioned into the Intelligence Corps in 1963, he transferred to the Parachute Regiment, with which he served two of his three tours of duty in Northern Ireland. On his first, he was present as an adjutant at the events of Bloody Sunday (1972), when soldiers opened fire on protesters, killing 13 people. On his second, he was a company commander in the aftermath of the Warrenpoint ambush (1979), the British Army&apos;s heaviest single loss of life during the Troubles. He was assigned to a staff post at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in 1982 before assuming command of the 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, in 1984. Jackson was posted to Northern Ireland for the third time, as a brigade commander, in the early 1990s. In 1994, Jackson served his first tour in the Balkans, where he commanded a multi-national division of the Implementation Force. Following a staff job back in the UK, he was appointed commander of NATO &apos;s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) in 1997. He returned to the Balkans with the ARRC during the Kosovo War, during which he famously refused to obey an order from American General Wesley Clark, his immediate superior in the NATO chain of command, to block the runways of Pristina Airport and isolate the Russian contingent that was positioned there. He reportedly told Clark, &quot; I&apos;m not going to start the Third World War for you &quot;. The incident attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, and earned Jackson the nickname &quot; Macho Jacko &quot; in the British tabloid press. Jackson established a working relationship with the Russian general commanding the detachment at Pristina, giving him a bottle of whisky, of which Jackson is known to be fond, and providing the Russians with the protection of a squad of British soldiers, commanded by his son, Mark. Upon his return to the UK, Jackson was promoted to full general and appointed Commander-in-Chief, Land Command, the second-most senior position in the British Army. After three years as Commander-in-Chief, Jackson was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, in 2003. He took up the post a month before the start of the Iraq War, amid disputes over the legality of the invasion and claims that the Army was under-equipped. However, he dismissed suggestions that the Army was at &quot; breaking point &quot;. The most controversial point of his tenure as CGS was the restructuring of the regiment system and amalgamation of many regiments into larger ones, leading to the loss of historic regiment names. He was succeeded as Chief of the General Staff by Sir Richard Dannatt in 2006, and retired from the Army after serving for almost 45  years. Jackson continues to speak on military matters and works as a consultant and guest lecturer, and has published an autobiography. He has three children, from two marriages, and four grandchildren. [ Early life ] Jackson&apos;s father, George, served as a soldier in the Household Cavalry before being commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps. On D-Day, George Jackson assumed command of a squadron of amphibious landing vehicles after his commanding officer was killed in action, and he was later awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and mentioned in despatches for his actions. Mike was born at his mother&apos;s home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, in 1944. After the Second World War, George Jackson was eventually posted to Tripoli, Libya, where the family lived for two years, during which time Jackson&apos;s younger sister was born. After suffering a heart attack, George Jackson retired with the rank of major after 40  years in the Army. { Soldier, pp. 1–3. } Jackson&apos;s mother, Ivy ( née Bower), { Jackson, Gen. Sir Michael David, (Sir Mike). } { Who&apos;s Who } { A &amp; C Black, 2011; online edn, } { Oxford University Press. Retrieved 30 May 2011. }, was a curator at a museum in Sheffield. Jackson was educated at various primary schools as the family moved with his father&apos;s postings before being sent to Stamford School, an independent boarding school in south Lincolnshire, where he became a house prefect. He joined the school&apos;s Combined Cadet Force along with John Drewienkiewicz, who eventually became a major general. By the age of 15 Jackson had decided that he wanted to be a soldier. { Soldier, pp 5–7. } [ Early military career ] Despite being advised by the headmaster at Stamford to consider university, Jackson applied to join the British Army in 1961. He was accepted, and started at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 1962, graduating on 20 December 1963. [ 43241 yes 1262 1264 7 February 1964 15 March 2011 ] While at Sandhurst, he became increasingly interested in the Parachute Regiment, but eventually applied to, and was commissioned into, the Intelligence Corps as a second lieutenant at the age of 19. After his commissioning, Jackson took up an opportunity offered by the Intelligence Corps to undertake platoon commanders&apos; training with a combat regiment, and opted to do so with the Parachute Regiment. { Soldier, p. 21. } Before leaving Sandhurst, he had applied to take an &quot; in-service degree &quot; —a degree sponsored by the Army at a civilian university—and was accepted to read Russian studies at the University of Birmingham, returning to the Army after graduation in 1967. { Soldier, p. 24. } [ http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/army_senior_appointments/22296.html Army senior appointments 23 July 2002 United Kingdom Government News 28 February 2011 ] His first promotion was to lieutenant on 20 June 1965, [ 43689 yes 5975 22 June 1965 2 March 2010 ] and he served with the Parachute Regiment in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Anguilla —where he served as adjutant when his battalion relieved the force sent to restore order during the 1969 emergency —after which he was promoted to the rank of captain. { Soldier, pp. 37–39. } [ 44994 yes 12862 22 December 1969 3 March 2010 ] Following Anguilla, his tenure with the Parachute Regiment ended and he reluctantly returned to the Intelligence Corps. He became increasingly determined to rejoin the Parachute Regiment and, after almost a year, was eventually allowed to transfer, retaining the rank of captain in 1970. { Soldier p.45. } [ 45240 yes 13112 1 December 1970 3 March 2010 ] He went on to serve in Northern Ireland as adjutant to 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), and was present at the events of Bloody Sunday, 30  January 1972, when 13  protesters were shot dead by soldiers from 1 PARA in Derry. He was in the tactical headquarters of the Army&apos;s operation to contain the protests immediately before the shooting began and he accompanied the battalion commander, Derek Wilford, when Wilford decided to join the soldiers on the ground. The shooting was over by the time Jackson reached the soldiers&apos; position, but he recalls seeing several bodies in the back of an Army vehicle. { Soldier, pp. 65–67. } In 1976, he was promoted to major [ 46953 yes 9285 9286 6 July 1976 3 March 2010 ] and attended the Staff College, Camberley, before being posted to Germany as chief of staff to the Berlin Infantry Brigade. After Berlin, Jackson served his second tour of duty in Northern Ireland, this time as a company commander. While there, he witnessed the aftermath of the 1979 Warrenpoint ambush, the British Army&apos;s single largest loss of life during The Troubles. He acted as the incident commander, arriving on the scene shortly after the second explosion, and had to identify Major Peter Fursman, a close friend, from the remains of Fursman&apos;s face, which had been blown clear of his skull. { Soldier, p. 123. } He later spoke of the effect the incident had on him, saying, &quot; It greatly disturbed me. Still does &quot;. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1979 Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours [ 47869 yes 5 16 June 1979 2 March 2010 ] and was mentioned in despatches in 1981, in recognition of his service in Northern Ireland. [ 48651 yes 8086 16 June 1981 2 March 2010 ] Having attended the National Defence College, Jackson joined the directing staff at the Army Staff College and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1981. [ 48677 yes 9300 13 July 1981 23 February 2011 ] He served as a member of the directing staff at the Staff College, Camberley, for two and a half years. During his tenure at Camberley, he was seconded to a staff position at the Ministry of Defence in 1982 during the Falklands War, and thus missed the opportunity to serve in the conflict directly. He took command of 1 PARA in March 1984, who, at the time, were deployed in Norway, training for the possibility of a Soviet attack. Concerned that he was insufficiently prepared for the weather conditions, he left Camberley early to train with the Royal Marines. { Soldier, pp. 142–143. } He was appointed Senior Directing Staff (Army) at the Joint Service Defence College from 1986 to 1988 and was promoted to colonel in 1987. [ 50979 yes 8354 8355 30 June 1987 3 March 2010 ] While serving as a colonel, Jackson considered resigning his commission. He wondered if he had missed his chance for promotion to brigadier at the age of 44, and believed he might have &quot; reached [his] ceiling &quot; as it was unusual for older officers to be selected for promotion. { Soldier, p. 151. } He was persuaded to try again the next year and was promoted to brigadier on 31  December 1989, [ 52017 yes 640 15 January 1990 23 February 2011 ] after spending six months on a Service Fellowship writing a paper on the future of the Army and taking the Higher Command and Staff Course. He went on to serve his third tour in Northern Ireland, commanding 39 Infantry Brigade —a post he held until 1992, thus missing the Gulf War. [ http://www.cmaworld.org/Public/Page_Local.aspx?Id%3D297 General Sir Mike Jackson GCB CBE DSO Cranfield Management Association 23 February 2011 ] He was promoted from Member to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1992. [ 53086 yes 17975 26 October 1992 2 March 2010 ] [ High command ] Jackson attained general officer status with promotion to acting major general in May 1992, after holding only one post as a brigadier; in peacetime, senior officers are normally expected to have held two posts before promotion. He was appointed Director General Personal Services (Army) at the Ministry of Defence, reporting to the Adjutant General. { Soldier, p. 174. } [ 52925 yes 8574 18 May 1992 2 March 2010 ] He was granted the substantive rank of major general in June 1992, with his promotion backdated to October 1991. [ 52983 yes 11403 6 July 1992 2 March 2010 ] After two years at the MoD, Jackson took command of the 3rd Mechanised Division in April 1994. [ 53690 yes 8294 6 June 1994 23 February 2011 ] During the Yugoslav Wars in 1995, Jackson had been due to succeed Rupert Smith as commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which would have entailed early promotion to lieutenant general ( three-star rank ) and a blue beret, signifying UN command. As a result of the Dayton Agreement, however, UNPROFOR became the NATO -led Implementation Force (IFOR), and Jackson remained a major general ( two-star rank ), commanding the 3rd Division and troops from several other countries who made up Multinational Division South-West. Jackson retained command of the 3rd Division until July 1996 and went on to serve briefly in a staff post as the Army&apos;s Director General of Development and Doctrine. [ 54486 yes 10563 5 August 1996 2 March 2010 ] He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in November 1996. [ 54574 yes 14850 8 November 1996 3 March 2010 ] After he was appointed Commander of NATO&apos;s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), Jackson was promoted to acting lieutenant general in January 1997, [ 54648 yes 476 14 January 1997 2 March 2010 ] a rank he was granted substantively in April 1997. [ 54726 yes 4170 8 April 1997 2 March 2010 ] Jackson served in the NATO chain of command, reporting to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, American four-star General Wesley Clark. Under Jackson&apos;s command, the ARRC deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1999, where Jackson served his second tour of duty in the Balkans, commanding KFOR, NATO&apos;s multi-national peacekeeping force established at the end of the Kosovo War. He gained significant media attention in June 1999 after a confrontation with Clark in which he refused to block the runways of the Russian-occupied Pristina Airport and isolate the Russian troops there, thus preventing them from flying in reinforcements, after the order was queried by Captain James Blount. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/671495.stm Confrontation over Pristina airport 9 March 2000 BBC News BBC 5 March 2010 ] [ http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/singer-james-blunt-prevented-world-war-3-refused-us-order-to-attack-russian-troops-15004204.html Singer James Blunt &apos;prevented World War 3&apos; Peck Tom 15 November 2010 The Belfast Telegraph Independent News &amp; Media 26 February 2011 ] In one heated discussion with Clark, Jackson reputedly told him &quot; I&apos;m not going to start the Third World War for you &quot;. He later told the BBC he believed that obeying the order would have led to the possibility of an armed confrontation with Russian troops, which he felt was not &quot; the right way to start off a relationship with Russians &quot;. The point became moot when the US government prevailed upon neighbouring countries, including Hungary and Romania, to prevent Russian use of their airspace to fly in reinforcements. Jackson was criticised for his actions by American military officers and politicians, including General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called the incident &quot; troubling &quot;, and Senator John Warner, who accused Jackson of insubordination.

Among his troops, Jackson was christened &quot; Darth Vader &quot; and &quot; Prince of Darkness &quot;, owing to his temper and gravelly voice.

Jackson, who is fond of whisky and cigars, [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6216808.stm Profile: General Sir Mike Jackson 1 September 2007 BBC News BBC 23 February 2011 ] discovered that the Russian troops were apprehensive about being attacked by the Kosovo Liberation Army, and promised to protect the Russians by sending a detachment of British soldiers commanded by his son Mark —along with a bottle of whisky. Jackson was knighted when he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1998, [ 55155 yes 2 15 June 1998 2 March 2010 ] and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1999 [ 55651 yes 11556 29 October 1999 2 March 2010 ] for his leadership in Kosovo. [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1536247/Profile-of-General-Sir-Mike-Jackson.html Profile of General Sir Mike Jackson 7 December 2006 The Daily Telegraph Telegraph Media Group 6 March 2010 ] Upon his return to the British chain of command in early 2000, he assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief, Land Command, the second-highest position in the British Army, and a post which entailed promotion to full general and membership of the Army Board. [ 55782 yes 2558 7 March 2000 2 March 2010 ] As Commander-in-Chief, Jackson was responsible for assembling forces for the 2000 British intervention in Sierra Leone, which included Brigadier David Richards —later Chief of the Defence Staff —and Jackson&apos;s son Mark. He also handled requests from the civilian authorities for assistance with the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, floods and strikes by firefighters and fuel-tanker drivers. { Soldier, pp. 307–310. } While still Commander-in-Chief, he stood in for the Chief of the General Staff, marching behind the coffin at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002.

He managed to return to the UK the next day aboard a casualty evacuation aircraft and had overall responsibility for force generation for the British Army&apos;s contribution to the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. { Soldier, pp. 315–316. } [ Chief of the General Staff ] { Royal Australian Air Force officer at } { The Cenotaph in London on } { Remembrance Day 2003. } { alt=Two men in military uniforms—one blue and one green—standing in front of a stone monument } Jackson succeeded General Sir Michael Walker as Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of, and highest post in, the British Army—on 1  February 2003, [ 56837 yes 1389 3 February 2003 2 March 2010 ] just over a month before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He later said that he &quot; did his homework &quot; in researching the disputed legality of the war and had convinced himself that the invasion was legal. Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, Jackson ordered an inquiry into the alleged abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. He admitted that the allegations had damaged the Army&apos;s reputation, but believed that further damage would be done by covering them up. Several soldiers were eventually convicted in connection with the abuse, after which Jackson publicly apologised on behalf the British Army and promised to appoint an officer to determine what lessons needed to be learnt. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4296511.stm Iraq abuse case soldiers jailed 25 February 2005 BBC News BBC 6 April 2011 ] Weeks after becoming CGS, Jackson was summoned to give evidence before the Bloody Sunday Inquiry. The most controversial action of Jackson&apos;s tenure as CGS was the Army&apos;s modernisation of the regiment al structure in 2004, in which many regiments were merged to form larger ones. The amalgamations led to the loss of many regimental names, including the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, which became part of The Rifles, and the Black Watch, which, after intervention by Queen Elizabeth II, retained its name but became a battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: &quot; There&apos;s a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot. Are you all right for boots? &quot; He later conceded that this could be seen as &quot; cavalier &quot;, and that he &quot; had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation &quot;, but that he &quot; didn&apos;t want to send a message to the enemy that we were in any way not ready &quot;. Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember&apos;s apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers. Jackson was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in December 2004 in the New Year Honours List. [ 57509 yes 2 31 December 2004 23 February 2011 ] His investiture took place immediately after the awarding of the Victoria Cross to Johnson Beharry, who was then a private soldier, as the VC takes precedence over all other awards. Speaking of Beharry&apos;s award, Jackson said he had &quot; never felt more proud of the British Army &quot;, [ http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/apr/27/military.iraq Iraq hero receives VC 27 April 2005 The Guardian Guardian News and Media 26 February 2011 ] and following the investiture said that he was &quot; overshadowed &quot; by Beharry, &quot; and quite rightly so—it was an honour to stand alongside him &quot;.

[ Honorary roles ] Jackson has held a number of honorary and ceremonial positions in various regiments. His first was as Honorary Colonel, 10 (Volunteer) Battalion, The Parachute Regiment in 1994, [ 53620 yes 4384 22 March 1994 2 March 2010 ] which he relinquished in 1999.

He spent nearly 45  years in the Army but called it &quot; a regret &quot; that he never fought in a conventional battle—having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that &quot; Fighting is what a young man with good red blood in his veins joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier &quot;. He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD&apos;s understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers&apos; accommodation &quot; frankly shaming &quot; and saying that the &quot; Armed Forces&apos; contract with the nation  ... must be a two-way one &quot;, going on to say that &quot; military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms &quot;.
