One of four main characters, along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick, he is generally referred to within the series by his surname. He debuted on television when South Park first aired on August 13, 1997; he had earlier appeared in The Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone in 1992 (Jesus vs. Frosty) and 1995 (Jesus vs. Santa). Voiced by Trey Parker, Cartman is an obese, immature, spoiled, selfish, manipulative, lazy, foul-mouthed, mean-spirited, sadistic, racist, sexist, anti-semitic, homophobic, xenophobic, sociopath ic, narcissistic, and ill-tempered elementary school student living with his unwed mother in the fictional town of South Park, Colorado, where he routinely has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life. Despite his many personality flaws, he is also depicted as being highly intelligent, outspoken, cunning and streetwise. He is one of few multilingual characters on the show, and is depicted speaking Spanish, French and German. He tends to make effective use of his capabilities by executing morally appalling—yet highly successful—business ideas. Cartman is one of the most popular characters on the show and has remained one of the most recognizable television characters ever since South Park became a hit during its first season. Parker and Stone describe the character as &quot; a little Archie Bunker &quot;, and state that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most identify. During its fifteen seasons, South Park has received both praise and criticism for Cartman&apos;s tendency to be politically incorrect and shockingly profane. Prominent publications and television channels have included Cartman on their lists of the most iconic television and cartoon characters of all time. [ Role in South Park ] Cartman attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison &apos;s class. During the show&apos;s first 58 episodes, Cartman and the other main child characters are in the third grade, after which they move on to the fourth grade. He is an only child being raised by Liane Cartman, a promiscuous single mother who in &quot; Cartman&apos;s Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut &quot; (1998) claims to be a hermaphrodite when she claims to be the father of Cartman.

Kyle, who is Jewish, is often the target of Cartman&apos;s slander and anti-Semitic insults. The two have shared an enmity since the show&apos;s beginnings, and their rivalry has become significantly more pronounced as the series has progressed, with Cartman even routinely exposing Kyle to physical endangerment. [ http://tv.ign.com/articles/859/859352p1.html &quot; Tonsil Trouble &quot; Review IGN Oct. 12, 2009 ] Although, at other times, Kyle is an enthusiastic participant in Cartman&apos;s schemes and Cartman is sometimes seen actually being nice to Kyle in some instances. { e.g. } { Wing (South Park), } { Crack Baby Athletic Association }. Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by Archie Bunker and Michael &quot; Meathead &quot; Stivic on the 1970s sitcom All in the Family. Kyle has a tendency to make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, and often loses these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman&apos;s motivation in this regard is not merely monetary gain, but an obsession with scoring a victory over Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part episode &quot; Imaginationland &quot; ( season 11, 2007). In &quot; You&apos;re Getting Old, &quot; the final episode of the first half of South Park&apos;s 15th season, it is hinted that Kyle and Cartman may be developing a genuine friendship, possibly due to the void left by Stan&apos;s apparent departure. Cartman&apos;s resentment of Stan is usually reserved for when Cartman proudly proclaims his hatred for both Stan and Kyle as a duo, and his contempt for Stan as an individual is usually limited to his annoyance with Stan&apos;s sensitivity, affection for animals, and the relationship Stan shares with Wendy. { Arp and Jacoby, pp. 58-65 } Despite being intolerant of other cultures, Cartman displays an aptitude for learning foreign languages. In the episode &quot; My Future Self n&apos; Me &quot; when he starts &quot; Parental Revenge Corp &quot;, he speaks Spanish to his Latino workers, though he may have learned the language merely from a practical standpoint in order to better exploit a labor pool. Not surprisingly he knows German, probably due to Nazi and white supremacist sympathies. He speaks it while dressed up as Adolf Hitler while promoting the extermination of Jews to an oblivious audience that didn&apos;t speak German. Cartman can also be seen speaking German fluently in Season 15 Episode 2 &quot; Funnybot &quot;. Conversely in one episode ( &quot; Major Boobage &quot; ) Cartman acts as an Oskar Schindler character for the town&apos;s cats, a rare case of a subplot based on Cartman&apos;s altruism. Cartman constantly teases Kenny for being poor, and derides Kenny&apos;s family for being on welfare.

Ever since the show&apos;s second episode, &quot; Weight Gain 4000 &quot; ( season one, 1997), Cartman, like all other characters on the show, has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique. Cartman is usually depicted wearing winter attire which consists of a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise knit cap tapered with a yellow pom-pon. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head is a more elliptical shape in contrast to the circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin. Although he had originally voiced Cartman without any computer manipulation, Parker now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range with a child-like inflection. The recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound like that of a fourth grader. [ Stephanie Jorgl South Park: Where The Sound Ain&apos;t No Joke!
