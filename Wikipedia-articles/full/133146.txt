Her village at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River was an important stopping point for the Moravian missionaries who were spreading the gospel throughout the wilderness of Pennsylvania during the 1740s. Count Zinzendorf, a missionary being guided by Conrad Weiser with the permission of Shikellamy came to Otstonwakin in 1742. Madame Montour was known to be a friend of the British.

She also had a great amount of influence with the various Indian tribes they were feeling the pressure of colonial expansion. Madame Montour remained loyal to the British despite several attempts by the French to bring her over to their side. Historians note that this was remarkable due to the fact the that British colonial government sometimes went as long as a year without paying her for her services.

Her son, Andrew took over leadership of Otstonwakin upon her death in the late 1740s. Andrew inherited his mother’s gift for languages. He spoke French, English, Lenape, Shawnee and the Iroquoian languages. Comfortable with both Native Americans and Europeans, he made a good living as a translator for both settlers and local tribes. In 1742 when Count Zinzendorf met Montour he wrote that Montour looked &quot; decidedly European, and had his face not been encircled with a broad band of paint we would have thought he was one. &quot; He also served as an interpreter with Conrad Weiser and Chief Shikellamy. He was granted [ 880 acre km2 ] of land by the Province of Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He later was appointed as a captain in George Washington &apos;s Army at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War. Andrew Montour left Montoursville at some point and moved to Juniata County before finally settling on Mountour&apos;s Island in the Allegheny River near Pittsburgh. [ Early settlers ] Montoursville was incorporated as a borough on February 19, 1850. The history of the borough begins about 40 years prior to its formal incorporation. John Else migrated to the Montoursville area from Bucks County, Pennsylvania in 1807. With his family when he was just ten years old. His father had a farm along Mill Creek in what is now Mill Creek Township. John Else worked to build the first permanent bridge over Loyalsock Creek in 1815. This was the first of many improvements that he held build to establish Montoursville as a viable community in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley.

John Burrows is recognized as being the founder of Montoursville. He was born near Rahway, New Jersey. In his youth Burrows delivered mail on horseback, riding between New York and Philadelphia. He also served as a courier for General George Washington during the American Revolution for fourteen months. Following the war Burrows migrated to Muncy and worked in the distilling business for several years. His work at the distilleries enabled him to build up the needed capital to make an investment in some land near the mouth of Loyalsock Creek, what is now Montoursville. Burrows also gained a measure of political clout in Lycoming County serving first as a justice of the peace before being elected to the county commissioner &apos;s post in 1802 and later to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1808. He bought [ 570 acre km2 ] in 1812. Burrows divided his land into lots in 1820 and sold them for $50.00 each. The first buyers of lots in Montoursville divided themselves into two distinct ethnic groups. The Germans settled in the eastern end in a neighborhood that became known as Coffee town, while the English settled in the western neighborhood that was known as Tea town. In addition to selling the lots in Montoursville Burrows operated a highly successful farm. His produce was sent by raft down the Susquehanna River and onto Baltimore where he was able to turn a profit. Burrowns used these profits to further his enterprise by building the first gristmill in the town. John Burrows continued to sell lots up until the time of his death in 1837. Nathaniel Burrows, son of John Burrows, was another successful businessman in Montoursville&apos;s early days. He opened the first general store in the town. He also received the contract for construction of the West Branch Canal in this section of Lycoming County. Nathaniel Burrows was able to influence the construction of the canal so that it ran further away from the river than usual and thereby closer to the town and the businesses of Nathaniel Burrows. [ Indian Park ] Indian Park is located on the north-western side of Montoursville and is parallel to Interstate 180 / U.S. Route 220. It serves as a large recreational park with several miles of hiking and biking trails, numerous softball fields, picnic areas and pavilions and fishing ponds. Indian Park was a trolley park during the late 19th century and early 20th century. Visitors from Williamsport would board the trolley in downtown Williamsport and ride to Indian Park to spend a day of recreation along the banks of Loyalsock Creek. The park was home to one of the largest and longest roller coasters on the East Coast of the United States. The park also featured over [ 20 acre m2 ] of ponds, a theatre, and a merry-go-round. The amusement park was ultimately closed in 1924 due in large part to the rising and continued cost of reconstructing the park following the nearly yearly floods on Loyalsock Creek.

It is a statue of an angel (sculpted by James Barnhill of Asheville, North Carolina ) on a base engraved with the names of the 21 local victims and a brief history. The memorial is in a circular grove of 21 trees (one for each victim). The angel was chosen because a cloud seen above the high school on July 21, 1996, was thought by many onlookers to resemble an angel, with 21 small clouds at its feet. Randolph Hudson of State College was chosen as the memorial designer and Beth Hershberger served as landscape designer.
