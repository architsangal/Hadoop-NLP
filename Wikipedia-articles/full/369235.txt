[ September 2007 March 2010 ] [ 27 20s twenty-seven th 3^3 1, 3, 9, 27 XXVII 11011 33 23 18 ] 27 (twenty-seven) is the natural number following 26 and preceding 28. [ In mathematics ] Twenty-seven is a perfect cube, being 3 3 = 3 × 3 × 3. 27 is also 2 3 (see tetration ). There are exactly 27 straight lines on a smooth cubic surface, which give a basis of the fundamental representation of the E 6 Lie algebra. 27 is also a decagonal number. 27 has an aliquot sum of 13 and is the first composite member of the 13-aliquot tree with the aliquot sequence (27,13,1,0). Twenty-seven is the aliquot sum of the two odd discrete semiprime s 69 and 133. 27 3 = 19,683 and 1+9+6+8+3=27. In base 10, it is the first composite number not evenly divisible by any of its digits. It is the radix (base) of the septemvigesimal positional numeral system. 27 is the only number that is 3 times the sum of its digits. In a prime reciprocal magic square of the multiples of 1/7, the magic constant is 27. In the Collatz conjecture (aka the &quot; 3n + 1 conjecture &quot; ) a starting value of 27 requires 112 steps to reach 1, many more than any lower number. The unique simple formally real Jordan algebra, the exceptional Jordan algebra of self-adjoint 3 by 3 matrices of quaternion s, is 27-dimensional. V. G. Kac, &quot; Classification of Simple Z-Graded Lie Superalgebras and Simple Jordan Superalgebras &quot; Communications in Algebra 5 13 (1977): 1380 In base 10, it is a Smith number and a Harshad number. It is the twenty-eighth (and twenty-ninth) digit in π. (3.141592653589793238462643383279...). If you start counting with 0 it is considered one of few Self-Locating strings in pi. 27 contains the decimal digits 2 and 7, and is the result of adding together the integers from 2 to 7 (2+3+4+5+6+7=27) There are 27 sproradic groups, if the Tits group is included.

This made it the first vacuum tube that could function as a detector in AC-powered radios. Prior to the introduction of the 27, home radios were powered by a set of three or more storage batteries with voltage s of 3 volts to 135 volts.
