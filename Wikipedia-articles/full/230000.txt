He is also famous for developing the Likert Scale, a psychometric scale commonly involved in research using questionnaires and the linking pin model. Likert was known for his support of interdisciplinary collaborations and emphasis on using social science research to effect positive change. { ISR: 60th Anniversary Timeline. &quot; Institute for Social Research. Web. 07 Dec. 2011. &lt; http://www.isr.umich.edu/home/anniversary/timeline.html &gt;. } [ Personal life ] Rensis Likert was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming to George Herbert Likert and Cora A. (née Zonne) Likert, where his father was an engineer with the Union Pacific Railroad. After training to be an engineer, the younger Likert was working as an intern with Union Pacific Railroad during the watershed 1922 strike. The lack of communication between the two parties made a profound impression on him and caused him to study organizations and their behavior for the rest of his life. Likert received his B.A. in sociology from the University of Michigan in 1926. The sociology of the 1920s was highly experimental and incorporated many aspects of modern psychology. In 1932 Likert received a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University. In his thesis, he devised a survey scale ( Likert Scales ) for measuring attitudes and showed that it captured more information than competing methods. The 1-5 Likert Scales would eventually become Likert&apos;s best-known work. Likert died, 3 September 1981 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the age of 78; leaving behind his wife of 53 years, Jane Gibson (3 June 1902 –29 November 1997). Both are interred in the Forest Hill Cemetery in Ann Arbor. { &quot; In Memoriam: Rensis Likert, 1903-1981 &quot;. Leslie Kish (1982). The American Statistician, Vol. 36, No. 2: pp. 124–12 } [ Professional achievements ] Rensis Likert was a founder of the University of Michigan &apos;s Institute for Social Research and was the director from its inception in 1946 until 1970, when he retired and founded Rensis Likert Associates to consult for numerous corporations. He also helped found what is now known as the Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp). During his tenure, Rensis Likert devoted particular attention to research on organizations. During the 1960s and 1970s, his books on management theory were extremely popular in Japan and their impact can be seen across modern Japanese organizations. He did research on major corporations around the world, and his studies have accurately predicted the subsequent performance of the corporations. [ Likert in World War II ] During World War II, Likert was the Director of Survey Divisions throughout different wartime agencies created by the government to compliment The Polling Division. Likert was not at a university at the time, but was actively recruiting other social psychologists into his expanding government survey shop as the United States entered the war. Likert, who was in charge of the Division of Program Surveys in the Department of Agriculture, was later asked to head a Surveys Division in the new Office of Facts and Figures. The Survey and the Polling Division, who were originally meant to work together, started to compete as competition arose for a tight budget. Each also differed in style of organizational management; Likert’s Survey Division was filled with academics and an academic culture, while the Polling Division was filled with a business-like culture. Because of differing values, each group thought they had a lot to teach the other group. The Polling Division was dominated by the use of closed questionnaires that could be easily processed and analyzed. Likert, on the other hand, advocated for open-ended questions, even though his famous Likert Scale is composed of closed-ended questions, after working for the Department of Agriculture. In the Department of Agriculture, he inherited the open question style from professionals who were interviewing recruits. The open questions (or as Likert liked to call them: “fixed questions”) or the free answer technique differed from the Polling Divisions open questions. { Strong Arguments and Weak Evidence: The Open/Closed Questioning Controversy of the 1940s, Jean M. Converse, The Public Opinion Quarterly, Vol. 48, No. 1 (Spring, 1984), pp. 267-282 } [ Likert Scale ] [ Likert Scale ] Likert developed the Likert scale in 1932, and used it to identify the extent of a person’s beliefs, attitudes, or feelings towards some object. The traditional Likert scale asks people the extent to which they agree or disagree with a statement on a 5-point scale. The scale ranges from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.” { Frey, Lawrence R., Botan, Carl H., &amp; Kreps, Gary L. (2000).

Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. } [ Management systems ] [ Likert&apos;s Management Systems ] Likert&apos;s Management Systems are management styles developed by Rensis Likert in the 1960s. He outlined four systems of management to describe the relationship, involvement, and roles of managers and subordinates in industrial settings. The four management systems are:1) Exploitative Authoritative2) Benevolent Authoritative3) Consultative System4) Participative System [ Books ] The following are books that Rensis Likert authored, or contributed to: { Rensis Likert Biography (2005).
