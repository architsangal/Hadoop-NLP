The movie also marks the debut of Lola Bunny. It was produced by Ivan Reitman, and directed by Joe Pytka (live-action), Tony Cervone, and Bruce W. Smith (animation). A fictional account of Jordan&apos;s retirement from the NBA, the film was released theatrically by Warner Bros. Family Entertainment on November 15, 1996. There was also a licensed pinball game by Sega based on the film and a video game by Acclaim Entertainment. It plays out as an alternate story of Jordan&apos;s initial return to basketball, this time with him being inspired by Bugs Bunny and others. Although the film received generally negative reviews, it was a box office success, opening at #1 in the US, and grossing over $230 million worldwide. [ Plot ] At the same time that NBA superstar Michael Jordan is retiring from basketball to pursue a career in baseball, Mister Swackhammer, proprietor of the extraterrestrial theme park &quot; Moron Mountain &quot;, is seeking new attractions for his failing park. He sends the &quot; Nerdlucks &quot; to capture the Looney Tunes, who live deep below ground. Bargaining for their freedom, the Looney Tunes challenge the Nerdlucks to a basketball game, since the thugs are all very short. Preparing to cheat in the game, the Nerdlucks return to Earth and steal the basketball talents of Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, Muggsy Bogues and Shawn Bradley. The Nerdlucks use their stolen talent to become the &quot; Monstars &quot; (or &quot; Mean Team &quot; ), gigantic creatures that the Looney Tunes are unable to defeat. To help them win, the characters recruit Jordan, who reluctantly agrees after the Monstars squash him into the shape of a basketball and bounce him around like one. In the beginning of the game between the TuneSquad and the Monstars rough up the Looney Tunes pretty badly until only Jordan, Bugs, Lola and Daffy are left standing, leaving them short one player. Bill Murray suddenly shows up and joins their team, averting forfeiture. At the game&apos;s climax, the TuneSquad are down by one, and it is up to Jordan to score the winning point. Extending his arm with the power of toon physics, Jordan makes the basket and wins the game. He convinces the Monstars that they&apos;re bigger than Mister Swackhammer, whom the Monstars send to the moon. Jordan also has them return the stolen basketball talent, reverting them back to the tiny Nerdlucks, so they decide to stay with the Looney Tunes instead of returning to Moron Mountain. Afterwards, Jordan is returned back to Earth, where he gives the stolen talent back to their other NBA players. He is later prompted by his rivals to return to the NBA, mirroring his real-life comeback. In the post credits, Bugs Bunny appears pops up in the classic bullseye saying &quot; That&apos;s all folks &quot;, only to be interrupted by Porky Pig, who in turn is interrupted by Daffy, who gets thrown out by the Nerdlucks, leaving them to complete the line. Michael Jordan then lifts the page to ask if he can go home now.
