[ September 2008 ] A map of the White Sea – Baltic Waterway, including the Neva and Svir Rivers and the canal Convict labor at the construction of the White Sea Canal, 1931–1933 Convicts at work, 1932 The White Sea – Baltic Sea Canal ( [ Беломо́рско–Балти́йский кана́л ], [ ru-Latn Belomorsko–Baltiyskiy Kanal ], [ ru-Latn BBK ] ), often abbreviated to White Sea Canal ( [ ru-Latn Belomorkanal ] ) is a ship canal in Russia opened on 2 August 1933. It connects the White Sea with Lake Onega, which is further connected to the Baltic Sea. Until 1961, its original name was the Stalin White Sea – Baltic Sea Canal (Belomorsko–Baltiyskiy Kanal imeni Stalina). The canal was constructed by forced labour of GULAG inmates and during its construction some 100,000 people died (although various estimates have been stated). The canal runs partially along several canalised rivers and Lake Vygozero. The total length of the route is [ 227 km mi ]. As of 2008, the canal sees only light traffic, carrying between ten and forty boats per day. Its economic advantages are limited by its minimal depth of 3.5  m (11.5  ft), [ December 2008 ] inadequate for most sea-going vessels. [ Waterway ] The total waterway length is [ 227 km ], of which [ 48 km ] are manmade. The current flows downwards from Lake Onega to the White Sea, and all navigation marks are set according to it. [ Canal route ] The canal begins near Povenets settlement in Povenets bay of Lake Onega. Right after Povenets there are seven locks close together, forming the &quot; Stairs of Povenets &quot;. These locks are the southern slope of the canal. The canal summit pond is [ 22 km ] long between the locks 7/8. The northern slope has twelve locks numbered 8–19. The route of the northern slope runs through five large lakes; Lake Matkozero between locks 8/9, Lake Vygozero between locks 9/10, Lake Palagorka between locks 10/11, Lake Voitskoye between locks 11/12, and Lake Matkozhnya between locks 13/14. The canal empties out into the Soroka Bay of the White Sea at Belomorsk. The settlements of Povenets, Segezha, Nadvoitsy, Sosnovets, and Belomorsk are located along the canal. [ Sailing conditions ] Minimum lock dimensions are [ 14.3 m on ] wide by [ 135 m on ] long. The navigable channel is [ 36 m on ] wide and [ 3.5 m on ] deep, with a radius of curvature of [ 500 m ]. Speed is limited to [ 8 km/h kn ] in all artificial portions. In case of low visibility (defined as less than one kilometre) navigation is halted. For the navigation seasons of 2008 to 2010, the canal locks were scheduled to operate from 20 May each year until 15/30 October, giving 148–163 navigation days per year. { ru Сроки работы шлюзов ( } [ Lock operation periods ] { ), from the site of the Russian Shipping Companies&apos; Association. } [ Canal use ] The cargo tonnage peaked during 1985 with 7.3 million tonnes being transported along the canal. Cargo quantities remained high during the following five years until 1990 and then declined. Early in the 21st century amounts began to rise gradually, but they remained low compared to the 1985 peak, just 283,400 tonnes in 2001 and 314,600 tonnes in 2002. During the shipping season of 2007, the canal&apos;s cargo volume was at 400,000 tonnes. 2,500 passengers travelled along the canal as well. The canal is operated by the agency known as White Sea and Lake Onega Waterways and Shipping Administration(Беломорско-Онежское государственное бассейновое управление водных путей и судоходства), which is also responsible for shipping on Lake Onega and in Belomorsk harbor area (but not throughout the actual White Sea). The canal, apparently, is a comparatively minor part of the agency&apos;s business, as in the same 2007, the agency&apos;s entire cargo volume was 4.6 million tonnes, and the passenger count, 155,000. According to the official statistics, the total of 193 million tons of cargo had been transported over the canal over the first 75 years of its operation (1938–2008). { 75 лет ББК (75 Years of the White Sea - Baltic Canal) (Government of Karelia Official Site, 2008-08-07) } The canal makes it possible to ship heavy and bulky items from Russia&apos;s industrial centers to the White Sea, and then by sea-going vessels to Siberia &apos;s northern ports. For example, in the summer of 2007, a large piece of equipment for Rosneft &apos;s Siberian Vankor Oil Field was delivered by the Amur-1516 from Dzerzhinsk on the Oka River, via the Volga–Baltic Waterway and the White Sea Canal to Arkhangelsk, and then from there by the ocean-going SA-15 class Arctic cargo ship Kapitan Danilkin to Dudinka on the River Yenisei. { ru Нефтяники получили свое ( } [ The oilmen got their cargo ] { ), } [ ru-Latn Murmansky Vestnik ] {, No. 110, 16 June 2007. } In 2011, heavy equipment for the Sayano-Shushenskaya Hydro Power Plant was shipped from Saint Petersburg via the canal, the Arctic seas, and the Yenisei River. { &quot; Силовые машины &quot; отгрузили вторую партию оборудования, предназначенного для восстановления Саяно-Шушенской ГЭС. (Silovye Machiny has shipped the second batch of equipment for the restoration of the Sayano-Shushenskaya Hydro Power Plant), RBK, 2011-08-25. } The canal system includes five hydroelectric power generating plants, with the total production capacity of 240 MW. [ Oil product shipping ] The canal has seen use shipping oil products from oil refineries on the Volga River to consumers in the Murmansk Oblast, or overseas. Russia&apos;s Volgotanker Company, which owns a fleet of suitably sized petroleum tanker s and ore-bulk-oil carrier s, pioneered this route starting in August 1970, when Nefterudovoz-3 delivered a cargo of fuel oil to the White Sea port of Kandalaksha. { Alexei Bambulyak, Bjorn Franzen. Transportation of oil from the Russian part of the Barents Sea region, as of January 2005 } After many years&apos; interruption, Volgotanker resumed using the canal route in 2003. The company had plans to carry 800,000 tonnes of fuel oil over the canal during 2003, and to increase the volume to 1,500,000 tonnes in 2004. The fuel was being transferred from Volgotanker river tankers to Latvia n seagoing tankers at a floating transfer station near the Osinki Island in the Onega Bay of the White Sea, [ 36 km ] north-east of the port of Onega. Transfer operations began on 24 June 2003. But on 1 September 2003 a low-speed collision between Volgotanker&apos;s Nefterudovoz-57M and the Latvian Zoja-I during a transfer caused a crack the Nefterudovoz&apos;s hull, with a subsequent oil spill age. Various estimates of the extent of the spill were made, the final one being 45  tonnes, of which only nine tonnes were recovered. Volgotanker&apos;s alleged failure to contain the spill, or to cooperate with the competent authorities in a timely manner, resulted in the Arkhangelsk Oblast authorities shutting down the oil transfer operation, at a point when only 220,000 tonnes had been exported. The company was fined and a permit for future operations was not granted. [ History of the construction of the canal ] [ June 2008 ] { Naftaly Frenkel (far right) at the White Sea – Baltic Canal works } The Soviets presented the canal as an example of the success of the First Five-Year Plan. Its construction was completed four months ahead of schedule. The entire canal was constructed in twenty months, between 1931 and 1933, almost entirely by manual labor. The canal was the first major project constructed in the Soviet Union using forced labor. BBLAG, the Directorate of the BBK Camps, serviced the construction, supplying a workforce of an estimated 100,000 convicts, { &quot; The Economics of Forced Labor: The Soviet Gulag &quot;, Chapter 8: &quot; The White Sea–Baltic Canal &quot; by Paul R. Gregory, page 158 } at the cost of huge casualties. { Gulag, The Storm projects - The White Sea Canal, Gulag.eu. Retrieved August 28, 2011. } Prison labor camp projects were not usually publicized, but the work on the Belomor canal was an exception, as the convicts were thought to not only construct the canal but reforge themselves in the process (Soviet concept of perekovka, or reforging). { O. Figes, The Whisperers 117 (2007) } [ Organization and management ] The workforce for the Canal was supplied by the Belbaltlag camp directorate (White Sea Baltic Corrective Labor Camp Directorate, WSBC) of the OGPU GULAG. P.F. Aleksandrov (П. Ф. Александров), acting chief of WSBC, January 16, 1932, full chief from March 28, 1932 to at least January 15, 1933 Matvei Berman, head of the GULAG during most of the 1930s, Firin reported directly to him Ruder, p. 21 Semyon Grigoryevich Firin ( :ru:Фирин, Семён Григорьевич ), Chief of Construction, also mentioned in 1933 documents as chief of WSBC Naftaly Frenkel, the Chief of Works, November 16, 1931 to the end of construction. Lazar Kogan, chief of the BBK Construction Directorate Yakov Davidovich Rappoport ( :ru:Раппопорт, Яков Давидович, deputy chief of the BBK Construction Directorate E.I. Senkevich (Э. И. Сенкевич), chief of WSBC, November 16, 1931-January 16, 1932, also assistant chief of the BBK Construction Directorate Система исправительно-трудовых лагерей в СССР Genrikh Yagoda, Deputy Chairman of the OGPU, as well as Berman, Firin, Kogan, and Rappoport were awarded medals for the completion of the canal by the Politburo on July 15, 1933. { Khlevniuk, p. 35 } [ Working conditions ] [ June 2008 ] { Agitprop propaganda poster used to motivate convict laborers during the construction. The writing on the poster says: &apos;Canal Army soldier! The heat of your work will melt your prison term!&apos; } The Soviets portrayed the project as evidence of the efficiency of the Gulag. Supposedly &quot; reforging &quot; &quot; class enemies &quot; (political prisoners) through &quot; corrective labor &quot;, the working conditions at the BBK Camp were brutal, with the prisoners given only primitive hand tools to carry out the massive construction project. { O. Figes, The Whisperers 114 (2007). } The mortality was about 8.7%. { V.N. Zemskov, &quot; Zaklyuchyonnye v 1930-e gody: socialno-demograficheskiye problemy &quot;, p. 62 / В.Н. 3емсков «Заключенные в 1930-е годы: социально — демографические проблемы», стр. 62 } Still more became sick and disabled. [ The canal and Russian writers ] A carefully prepared visit in August 1933 to the White Sea – Baltic Canal may have hidden the worst of the brutality from a group of 120 Russian writers and artists, the so-called Writers Brigade, including Maxim Gorky, Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, Viktor Shklovsky, and Mikhail Zoshchenko, who compiled a work in praise of the project, the 600-page Stalin White Sea–Baltic Canal ( [ Беломорско-Балтийский канал имени Сталина ] ), published at the end of 1934. However, it should be noted that Shklovsky visited Belomorkanal on his own and did not travel there with the group organized by Maxim Gorky. Likewise, Gorky himself did not travel with the Brigade but instead organized the trip. Gorky had previously visited the Solovetski Islands labor camp in 1929 and wrote about it in the Soviet journal Our Accomplishments. Additionally, it is doubtful that all of the writers involved in the project were unaware of the brutality or actual living conditions present in the camp. In fact, one of the contributors, Sergei Alymov, was a prisoner at the Belomor camp and was the editor for the camp newspaper Perekovka, ( &quot; Re-forging &quot; ). Similarly, Aleksandr Avdeenko&apos;s account of the trip to Belomor includes conversations between OGPU chief Semyon Firin and Prince Mirsky that reveal at least some of the writers were aware of the true nature of Belomor. [ Commemoration ] The canal was commemorated by the Soviet Belomorkanal cigarette brand. There was a monument for the prisoners who perished during the construction at Povenets, and a smaller memorial in Belomorsk near to the entrance of the canal into the White Sea. There was even a play, a comedy, written about the canal by Nikolay Pogodin. A memory of the canal is also preserved in the Russian language, in the words &quot; zeka &quot;, &quot; zek, z/k &quot; for &quot; inmate &quot;. Originally the abbreviation stood for [ ru заключённый каналоармеец ], literally &quot; incarcerated canal-army-man &quot;. It was usually abbreviated to [ ru з/к ] in paperwork, and pronounced as [ ru зэка́ ] ( [ zɨˈka IPA ] ), which gradually transformed into [ ru зэк ] ( [ ˈzɛk IPA ] ), then [ ru зек ] ( [ ˈzʲek IPA ] ). { &quot; White Sea Baltic Canal named after Stalin.
