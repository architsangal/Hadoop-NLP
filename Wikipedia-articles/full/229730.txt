He rose to prominence during his time at Arsenal from 1996 to 2005, where he won three Premier League titles – one unbeaten – and four FA Cup s, eventually becoming club captain. After leaving Arsenal in 2005, he spent one season at Juventus before joining Internazionale in 2006, following Juventus&apos; relegation for their part in a match-fixing scandal. He has 107 caps for France, and was part of their 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 -winning sides. In May 2010, Vieira was nominated Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. He announced his retirement from professional football on 14 July 2011.

His grandfather served in the French Army, making him eligible for French nationality at birth. His surname Vieira, which is Portuguese, is his mother&apos;s maiden name, who is from Cape Verde. [ Vieira: My Autobiography Patrick Vieira 978-0-7528-7260-5 2005 ] Vieira first played for AS Cannes, where he made his debut at the age of 17 and captained the team aged just 19. In the summer of 1995, he was signed by Italian giants Milan, though he played mainly in the reserves and made only two first-team appearances. [ Arsenal ] In September 1996, the incoming Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger requested Vieira&apos;s purchase from Milan prior to taking up his position. Vieira was signed for £3.5  million, a figure which would be deemed a bargain in years to come. { Where Are They Now?, premierleague.com, accessed 29 May 2007. } { Fordyce, Tom, &quot; Bargain Hunt: The Premiership Years &quot;, news.bbc.co.uk, 22 January 2003, accessed 29 May 2007. } His height, stamina, and physical strength allowed him to settle into the English game quickly, while his composure and the quality of his passing cemented his position as an integral part of Wenger&apos;s stylish attacking side. Forming a powerful midfield partnership with French compatriot Emmanuel Petit, Vieira won the Premier League and FA Cup Double in 1998, his first full season at the club. { Arsenal – summary of the 1997/98 season, arseweb.com, accessed 29 May 2007. } That summer, he was called up to France &apos;s 1998 World Cup squad. Vieira&apos;s early years at Arsenal were beset by disciplinary problems. In the 2000–01 season, he was sent off twice in two consecutive matches (the opening matches of the season), though after returning he did not receive another card for 28 matches. In all, he has been sent off twelve times in his career: nine times with Arsenal and once each with Juventus, France, and Internazionale. Vieira (center, on podium) holding the 2003–04 Premiership trophy after Arsenal&apos;s unbeaten season. Vieira would go on to win UEFA Euro 2000 with France, as well as a second Double with Arsenal in 2002. He also played in the 2000 UEFA Cup Final. Arsenal lost the final to Turkish side Galatasaray on penalties, with Vieira missing his. After Tony Adams &apos; retirement in 2002, Vieira (already vice-captain) became club captain, since which his disciplinary problems cooled significantly. Though he missed Arsenal&apos;s 2003 FA Cup Final win with injury and therefore did not qualify for a winner&apos;s medal, Vieira lifted the trophy jointly with captain for the day David Seaman. In 2003–04 at Arsenal, he captained the side on an historic unbeaten season in the Premier League. { CLUB RECORDS, arsenal.com, accessed 23 May 2007. } At the beginning of this campaign, he was in and out of the side because of a hamstring injury, with Ray Parlour replacing him in the side. Vieira returned for the Champions League match against Lokomotiv Moscow, however, with the Gunners winning 2–0 and qualifying for the first knockout round. [ 2004–05 season and Madrid speculation ] { Vieira decides to stay at Arsenal, CNN, 23 August 2004, accessed 10 August 2009. } Following Real Madrid &apos;s unsuccessful approach, Vieira remained Arsenal&apos;s captain for the 2004–05 season, during which the club broke Nottingham Forest &apos;s record for the highest number of games unbeaten in the Premiership. { Arsenal run ends at 49, BBC, 25 October 2004, accessed 12 August 2009. } Vieira made a solid start to the season but was not in sparkling form. Arsenal had passed the record and were 49 games unbeaten and were first in the table with 25 points from a possible 27. They were 49 and out when they lost to Manchester United; Vieira&apos;s and Arsenal&apos;s form then decreased with draws against relegation candidates Southampton, Crystal Palace, and West Bromwich Albion which saw them fall to second place. Vieira scored his first goal of the season in a topsy-turvy North London derby, which Arsenal won 5–4. Vieira scored his second goal of the season in vain as Arsenal lost to a weakened Liverpool. Chelsea were starting to sail away with the title and Arsenal were struggling to keep up with Chelsea despite a creditable 2–2 draw with the league leaders. Arsenal then suffered a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Bolton Wanderers before Manchester United completed the double over Arsenal with a 4–2 win at Highbury, in which Vieira scored the opening goal. Before this game started, Vieira had a big confrontation with Manchester United captain Roy Keane, in which Keane confronted him about an incident involving Gary Neville. Arsenal fell to third, but improved to take second ahead of United. Arsenal also finished with impressive home wins against fifth place Liverpool and fourth place Everton with Vieira scoring against Everton in a massive 7–0 win. Vieira scored in the fourth round of the FA Cup 2004-05 in a 2–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. In the 2005 FA Cup Final, he scored the winning penalty in a penalty shoot-out after a 0–0 draw with Manchester United. { Redknapp keen on ex-Gunner Vieira. } { BBC Sport (24 July 2009). Retrieved on 2009-07-25. } Renewed speculation about Vieira&apos;s future emerged at the conclusion of the season, and the cup victory ultimately proved to be his final game for Arsenal. In August 2008, Vieira was ranked the fifth-greatest Arsenal player of all-time in a fan poll conducted on the club&apos;s official website. { Greatest 50 Players | History. Arsenal.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-08. } [ Exit from Arsenal ] On 14 July 2005, Arsenal accepted a bid of €20  million from Italian giants Juventus [ http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/comunicatipricesensitive/14_lug_2005_eng.pdf Agreement with Arsenal F.C. for the acquisition of the registration rights of the player Patrick Vieira 14 July 2005 12 June 2010 Juventus FC official site ] and Vieira agreed a five-year contract with the Serie A side the following day. One of the reasons for his transfer was also the emergence of teenager Cesc Fàbregas, who had played in place of Vieira when the latter was injured. In total, Vieira played 407 times for Arsenal and scored 34 times. In his time at Arsenal, Vieira appeared in the PFA Team of the Year six years in a row from the 1998–99 season up to the 2003–04 season. He returned to Arsenal for one game on 22 July 2006 in a testimonial for Dennis Bergkamp as one of the Arsenal legends against AFC Ajax legends. Despite his departure, Vieira has remained a favourite among Arsenal fans. An image of him sits alongside 14 other past and present Arsenal greats in &quot; The Armoury, &quot; the club&apos;s shop at the Emirates Stadium. [ Juventus ] After Vieira&apos;s move to Juventus, then-Juventus manager Fabio Capello used Vieira in a midfield consisting of Brazil ian Emerson and Czech Pavel Nedvěd. He helped Juventus to record their best ever start to a league season. Despite his performances dipping as the result of a persistent groin injury and a reported training ground bust-up with teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović, Vieira helped Juventus retain the Scudetto, which was later stripped. In a twist of fate, Vieira returned to Highbury on 28 March 2006 to play against Arsenal in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League. Arsenal won 2–0 on aggregate, scoring twice in the first leg. Vieira received a yellow card in the first leg match at Highbury and was suspended for the return leg on 5 April 2006. During the first leg, he was the subject of a strong tackle by former club and national teammate Robert Pirès. Vieira was left crestfallen as Pirès regained possession and Arsenal attacked, scoring the first goal of the tie through Cesc Fàbregas. Pirès humorously quipped that it was the first time in 13 years he had got the better of Vieira physically. { Haond, Patrick, &quot; Pirès delight at dumping Vieira &quot;, skysports.com, 29 March 2006, accessed 29 May 2007. } Vieira playing with Inter [ Internazionale ] Juventus were stripped of their 2004–05 and 2005–06 titles after it was revealed they were involved in a match-fixing scandal. { Juventus relegation appeal fails, news.bbc.co.uk, 18 August 2006, accessed 29 May 2007. } Juventus were relegated to Serie B and deducted 17 points by the Italian Football Federation for their involvement, prompting many of the club&apos;s major stars to move elsewhere. After press speculation linking him to various clubs, including a move back to Arsenal, on 2 August 2006, Vieira officially signed a four-year deal for Internazionale in a deal to be worth €9.5 million, [ http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/comunicatipricesensitive/02_ago_2006_eng_vie.pdf Agreement with F.C.

But due to injury, he failed to become one of the regular starter; Olivier Dacourt, initially a backup player, became manager Roberto Mancini &apos;s first choice player in the 2006–07 season. And since the club signed Sulley Muntari and Thiago Motta, Vieira became of lesser and lesser importance in the team. In response to extensive media speculation regarding a possible return by Vieira to his former club in 2009, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger admitted that he would contemplate re-signing Vieira.

Nonetheless, he and veteran defender Lilian Thuram were instrumental in convincing Zidane to end his retirement and help the flagging campaign to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.
