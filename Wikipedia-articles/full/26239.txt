[ History ] The state of Rhineland-Palatinate was established on 30 August 1946. It was formed from the northern part of the French Occupation Zone, which included parts of Bavaria (the Rhenish Palatinate ), the southern parts of the Prussia n Rhine Province (including the District of Birkenfeld which formerly belonged to Oldenburg ), parts of the Prussian Province of Nassau (see Hesse-Nassau ), and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt ( Rhinehessen on the western banks of the Rhine ); the constitution was legally confirmed by referendum on 18 May 1947. [ Geography ] Situated in western Germany, Rhineland-Palatinate borders (from the north and clockwise) North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Baden-Württemberg, France, Saarland, Luxembourg and Belgium. The largest river in the state is the Rhine, which forms the border with Baden-Württemberg and Hesse in the southeast before flowing through the northern part of Rhineland-Palatinate. The Rhine Valley is bounded by mountain chains and forms a fascinating landscape containing some of the most historically significant places in Germany. The Eifel and Hunsrück mountain chains are found on the west bank of the Rhine in northern Rhineland-Palatinate, while the Westerwald and Taunus mountains are found on the east bank. The hilly lands in the southernmost region of the state are covered by the Palatinate forest and the Palatinate. These mountain chains are separated from each other by several tributaries of the Rhine: the Mosel, the Lahn and the Nahe. The modern state consists of a conglomeration of the historic regions of southern Rheinland Province, Rheinhessen and the Palatinate. See also List of places in Rhineland-Palatinate. [ Administration ] { Mainz } { Koblenz } { Trier } { Speyer } Rhineland-Palatinate is divided into 24 districts, formerly grouped into the three administrative regions : Koblenz, Trier and Rheinhessen-Pfalz. Since 2000, the employees and assets of the former administrative regions have been organized into the Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion Trier (Supervisory and Service Directorate Trier) and the Struktur- und Genehmigungsdirektionen (Structural and Approval Directorates) Nord in Koblenz and Süd in Neustadt (Weinstraße).

The Takkanot Shum ( [ תקנות שו &quot; ם ] ), or Enactments of ShU &quot; M were a set of decrees formulated and agreed upon over a period of decades by their Jewish community leaders. The official web site for the city of Mainz states: [ One of the most glorious epoches in Mainz’s long history was the period from the beginning of the 900&apos;s and evidently much earlier. Following the barbaric Dark Ages, a relatively safe and enlightened Carolingian period brought peace and prosperity to Mainz and much of central–western Europe. For the next 400 years, Mainz attracted many Jews as trade flourished. The greatest Jewish teachers and rabbis flocked to the Rhine. Their teachings, dialogues, decisions and influence propelled Mainz and neighboring towns along the Rhine into world-wide prominence. Their fame spread, rivaling that of other post- Diaspora cities such as Bagdhad. Western European— Ashkenazic or Germanic— Judaism became centered in Mainz, breaking free of the Babylonia n traditions. A Yeshiva was founded in the 10th century by Gershom ben Judah.

Benckiser, SGE Deutsche Holding, Schott Glassworks concludes the top 5 employers in the state. [ Agriculture and viticulture ] Rhineland-Palatinate is Germany&apos;s leading producer of wine in terms of grape cultivation and wine export. Its capital, Mainz, may be called the capital of the German wine industry, being the home of the German Wine Institute, the German Wine Fund in the Haus des Deutschen Weines (House of German Wine), and the Verband Deutscher Prädikats- und Qualitätsweingüter Wine Bourse, which brings together the top winemaker s of Germany and the wine merchants of the world. Of thirteen wine regions producing quality wine in Germany, six ( Rheinhessen, Pfalz, Mosel, Nahe, Mittelrhein and Ahr ) are located in Rhineland-Palatinate, with 65% to 70% of the production of wine grapes in Germany having their origin within the state. 13,000 wine producers generate 80% to 90% of the German wine export, which was 2.6  million  hectoliters in 2003. [ May 2010 ] Traditional grape varieties and a wide range of varieties developed during the last 125 years are characteristic for the region. Classical white varieties are cultivated at [ 63683 ha acre ]. These comprise the famous Riesling s [ 14446 ha acre ], Müller-Thurgau ( [ 8663 ha acre ] ), Silvaner ( [ 3701 ha acre ] ) and Kerner ( [ 3399 ha acre ] ). The share of red varieties grew constantly during the last decades and amounts to [ 20000 ha acre ]. Dornfelder, a new cultivar, is the leading red grape cultivated on [ 7626 ha acre ], which is more than a third. Blauer Portugieser ( [ 4446 ha acre ] ) and Spätburgunder ( [ 3867 ha acre ] ) show also appreciable cultivated shares. { Cultivated grape varieties in Rhineland-Palatinate 2005 publisher: Statistical Office of Rhineland-Palatinate } In addition, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay as white varieties and Regent and St. Laurent as red varieties have been increasing their share, as the growing conditions improve in Rhineland-Palatinate. The state supports the wine industry by providing a comprehensive consultancy and education program in the service supply centers (German: DLR) of the land. The Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding and also the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute are fully or even partially financed by the state. Many well known new breeds, such as Morio-Muskat, Bacchus, Optima and Regent have been created in these institutes. The world-wide leader in sparkling wine production, producing 245  million bottles in 2006, is the renowned Schloss Wachenheim Group. This company is headquartered in Trier, with operations in several locations in Rhineland-Palatinate. { annual report Schloss-Wachenheim Group 2005/2006 publisher: Schloss-Wachenheim Group } Other renowned sparkling wine producers, such as Kupferberg, Deinhard and Henkell, also had their roots in the region, but now belong to companies outside the state as a result of business consolidation. [ Emigration ] Rhineland-Palatinate has supplied immigrants to many parts of the world. The names of the villages of New Paltz, Palatine Bridge and German Flatts, New York and Palatine, Illinois attest to settlements of Palatine Germans. The Hunsrückisch en dialect in Brazil also bears testimony to an immigrant community. The Pennsylvania Dutch spoken by the Amish in the United States is (among other dialects) derived from the German dialect spoken in the Rhineland-Palatinate, which many Palatine refugees brought to the colony in the early decades of the 18th century. The only existing Pennsylvania German newspaper, Hiwwe wie Driwwe is being published bi-annually in the village Ober-Olm, which is located close to Mainz, the state capital. In the same village, one can find the headquarter of the German-Pennsylvanian Association. Certain colonies in the United States were settled by major groups of poor Palatines —then refugees in England —passage paid for by Queen Anne to reduce the number of impoverished families who had taken refuge in London. In 1710 the English used ten ships to transport nearly 3,000 Germans to the colony of New York. Many died en route, as they had been weakened by disease. They were settled in work camps along the Hudson River, where they developed naval stores for the English to work off their passage. Churches set up in both the East and West Camps provided some of the earliest population records in New York. In 1723 the first hundred heads of families were allowed to acquire land west of Little Falls, New York along the Mohawk River, in what was called the Burnetsfield Patent after the governor. This became Herkimer County. The Germans and their descendants were important in the defense of the Mohawk Valley during the American Revolutionary War. New Bern is one of the earliest North Carolina colonies settled in 1710 by about 400 Palatines (650 left Germany, but about half died in passage) and 100 Swiss. This venture was orchestrated by the Swiss-born Christoph von Graffenried after purchasing more than [ 19000 acre ha ] from the British Proprietors of the Carolinas. In the 19th century, there was a substantial numbers of emigrants from the area around Trier, many of whom settled in Wisconsin.
