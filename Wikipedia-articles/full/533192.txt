[ 2009 05 25 ] { Microsoft Windows } { Proprietary ( } { Freeware ) } TrueSpace (styled as trueSpace) was a freeware 3D computer graphics and animation software developed by Caligari Corporation, bought-out by Microsoft. As of May 2009, it has been officially discontinued, but with some &apos;unofficial support&apos; up to February 2010, at least. [ History ] The company was founded in 1985 by Roman Ormandy. A prototype 3D video animation package for the Amiga Computer led to the incorporation of Octree Software in 1986. From 1988 to 1992, Octree released several software packages including Caligari1, Caligari2, Caligari Broadcast, and Caligari 24. Caligari wanted to provide inexpensive yet professional, industrial video and corporate presentation software. In 1993 Octree Software moved from New York to California and became known as Caligari Corporation. In 1994 trueSpace 1.0 was introduced on the Windows platform.In early 2008, the company was acquired by Microsoft and trueSpace 7.6 was released for free.

It is with regret that I have to tell you that trueSpace is one of the products affected. As a consequence, you will see reduction or elimination of services offered for trueSpace. For example, there will be no phone or email support offered for trueSpace by Microsoft, and our web site may also be affected. While the dates are not absolutely fixed, some services and contacts may come to an end as early as Friday May 22, 2009, while others will continue as long as possible with no firm cutoff date available yet.

[ Overview ] TrueSpace is a modeling/animation/rendering package. It features a plug-in architecture that allows the user to create tools to enhance the core package. TrueSpace is currently at release version 7 (also known to its users as tS7). Point upgrades have brought it up to version 7.6, and have added new modeling features. It also has an interface that beginners will find easy to learn. Caligari has enhanced the modeling, surfacing and rendering capabilities of TrueSpace, and the latest version TrueSpace7 allows all aspects of real-time design, modeling and animation within a virtual 3D space shared by remote participants over the broadband internet. The TrueSpace7 collaboration server enables multiple participants to connect to a shared 3D space to create and manipulate shared content in real-time. [ Features ] One of the most distinctive features of trueSpace is its interface, using mainly 3D widgets for most common editing operations. trueSpace can also be scripted, using Python for creating custom scripts, tools and plugins. trueSpace7 introduces the use of VBScript and JScript as scripting tools for developing plugins and interactive scenes. trueSpace is also known for its icon heavy interface which was drastically overhauled for version 7 onwards. While staff at Caligari had originally made them &apos;inhouse&apos; during the creation process of earlier releases, trueSpace 7 had a new set of icons made by Paul Woodward, a freelance designer and illustrator. Capabilities of the software include creating visualizations and animations with realistic lighting (through the use of radiosity, HDRI and Global Illumination ) and organic modelling using NURBS, subdivision surface s and metaballs. The software has several native formats: RsScn for scenes, RsObj for objects, RSMat for materials, rsl for layouts, RsLgts for lighting, etc. Older formats native to trueSpace6.6 and earlier are also supported, e.g. one for standalone objects (with the file extension.cob), and another for the scenes (with the file extension.scn). Objects in trueSpace can be embedded in Active Worlds. In addition to its native formats, trueSpace can also import and export several additional model types. [ Modeling ] Polygon modeling NURBS Subdivision surface [ Rendering and surfacing ] Currently TrueSpace has two native internal rendering engines and also support for DX9 pixel shader output quality images alongside the traditional style Render engines.
