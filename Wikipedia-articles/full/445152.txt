Martin 2004 Historical Dictionary of Angola 110 ] { Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola } António Agostinho Neto (September 17, 1922 – September 10, 1979) served as the first President of Angola (1975 –1979), leading the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in the war for independence and the civil war. His birthday is celebrated as National Heroes Day, a public holiday in Angola. [ Early life ] Born at Ícolo e Bengo, in Bengo Province, Angola, in 1922, Neto attended high school in the capital city, Luanda; his father, also called Agostinho Neto, was a Methodist pastor. The younger Neto left Angola for Portugal, and studied medicine at the universities of Coimbra and Lisbon. He combined his academic life with covert political activity of a revolutionary sort; and PIDE, the security police force of the Estado Novo regime headed by Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar, arrested him in 1951 for his separatist activism. Seven years later he was released from prison, and he finished his studies, marrying a white 23-years-old Portuguese woman who was born in Trás-os-Montes, Maria Eugénia da Silva, the same day he graduated. He returned to Angola in 1959. [ Tvedten Inge 1997 Angola: Struggle for Peace and Reconstruction 29–30 ] [ Political career ] In December 1956 the Angolan Communist Party (PCA) merged with the Party of the United Struggle for Africans in Angola (PLUA) to form the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola with Viriato da Cruz, the President of the PCA, as Secretary General and Neto as President. [ 1977 Africa Year Book and Who&apos;s who 238–239 ] The Portuguese authorities in Angola arrested Neto on June 8, 1960. His patients and supporters marched for his release from Bengo to Catete, but were stopped when Portuguese soldiers shot at them, killing 30 and wounding 200 in what became known as the Massacre of Icolo e Bengo. At first Portugal&apos;s government exiled Neto to Cape Verde. Then, once more, he was sent to jail in Lisbon. After international protests were made to Salazar&apos;s administration urging Neto&apos;s release, Neto was freed from prison and put under house arrest. From this he escaped, going first to Morocco and then to Zaire. In 1962 Neto visited Washington D.C. and asked the Kennedy administration for aid in his war against Portugal. The U.S. government turned him down, choosing instead to support Holden Roberto &apos;s comparatively anti-Communist FNLA.

[ Abbott Peter Manuel Ribeiro Rodrigues 1988 Modern African Wars: Angola and Mocambique, 1961-74 10 ] He visited Havana many times, and he and Fidel Castro shared similar ideological views.

Boulder, Colorado 1-55587-283-2 392 ] Following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal during April 1974 (which deposed Salazar&apos;s successor Marcelo Caetano ), three political factions vied for Angolan power. One of the three was the MPLA, to which Neto belonged. On November 11, 1975, Angola achieved full independence from the Portuguese, and Neto became the nation&apos;s ruler. His government developed close links with the Soviet Union and other nations in the Eastern bloc and other Communist state s, particularly Cuba, which aided the MPLA considerably in its war with the FNLA, UNITA and South Africa. However, while Neto made the MPLA declare Marxism-Leninism its official doctrine, his position was to favour a socialist, not a communist model. As a consequence, he violently repressed a movement later called Fractionism which in 1977 attempted a coup d&apos; état inspired by OCA (Organização dos Comunistas de Angola). An estimated 18,000 followers (or alleged followers) of Nito Alves were killed in the aftermath of the attempted coup, over a period that lasted up to two years. Neto died in a hospital in Moscow, while undergoing surgery for cancer, shortly before his 57th birthday. Jose Eduardo dos Santos succeeded him as president. But the Angolan civil war continued to rage for almost a quarter of a century more. [ Legacy ] The Soviet Union awarded Neto the Lenin Peace Prize for 1975-76. The public university of Luanda, the Agostinho Neto University, is named after him. A poem by Chinua Achebe entitled Agostinho Neto was written in his honor. [ Achebe Chinua Agostinho Neto http://www.bu.edu/agni/poetry/print/2002/56-achebe.html 2008-05-14 ] An airport in Santo Antão, Cape Verde, is named after him, due to the beloved work he performed there as a doctor. There is also a morna dedicated to him. A street in New Belgrade in Serbia is named after him, the Dr. Agostina Neta street. In 1973, during one of his few unofficial visits to Bulgaria, Neto met a woman with whom he had a daughter called Mihaela Marinova. Unfortunately Neto&apos;s sudden death did no favor for his daughter who had been raised in orphanages in Bulgaria. Neto&apos;s family has not recognised the child. { http://www.publico.pt/Mundo/mihaela-marinova-e-filha-de-agostinho-neto_1463442 } [ References ] [ External links ] Encyclopedia [ Position created ] [ President of Angola 1975–1979 ] [ Jose Eduardo dos Santos ] [ Agostinho Neto ] [ Neto, Agostinho September 17, 1922 Bengo, Angola ( then a Portugal-ruled territory ) September 10, 1979 Moscow, Soviet Union ] Category:1922 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Angolan communists Category:Angolan escapees Category:Angolan revolutionaries Category:Lenin Peace Prize recipients Category:Angolan writers Category:Cold War leaders Category:Communist rulers Category:Deaths from surgical complications Category:Escapees from Portuguese detention Category:Lenin Prize winners Category:Presidents of Angola Category:Portuguese-language writers Category:MPLA politicians Category:University of Coimbra alumni Category:University of Lisbon alumni ar:أوغوستينو نيتو ast:António Agostinho Neto br:Agostinho Neto bg:Агостиньо Нето ca:Agostinho Neto cs:António Agostinho Neto de:Agostinho Neto et:Agostinho Neto el:Αγκοστίνιο Νέτο es:António Agostinho Neto eo:Agostinho Neto eu:Agostinho Neto fr:Agostinho Neto gl:Agostinho Neto ko:아고스티뉴 네투 hr:Agostinho Neto io:Agostinho Neto id:Agostinho Neto it:Agostinho Neto ka:აგოსტინიო ნეტო kk:Нето Антонио Агостиньо la:Augustinus Neto mk:Агостињо Нето nl:Agostinho Neto ja:アゴスティニョ・ネト no:Agostinho Neto nn:Agostinho Neto oc:Agostinho Neto pl:Agostinho Neto pt:Agostinho Neto qu:Agostinho Neto ru:Нето, Антонио Агостиньо sl:António Agostinho Neto sr:Агостино Нето sh:Agostinho Neto fi:Agostinho Neto sv:Agostinho Neto tr:Agostinho Neto uk:Агоштінью Нету yo:Agostinho Neto
