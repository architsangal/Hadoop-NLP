When New Hampshire separated from Massachusetts in 1741 Upper Ashuelot became part of New Hampshire. During King George&apos;s War, the village was attacked and burned by Indians. Colonists fled to safety, but would return to rebuild in the early 1750s. It was regranted to its inhabitants in 1753 by Governor Benning Wentworth, who renamed it Keene after Sir Benjamin Keene, English minister to Spain and a West Indies trader. Located at the center of Cheshire County, it became county seat in 1769. Land was set off for Sullivan and Roxbury, although Keene would annex [ 154 acre km2 ] from Swanzey (formerly Lower Ashuelot). Boston and Maine railroad yard in Keene, circa 1916 Timothy Dwight, the Yale president who chronicled his travels, called the town &quot;...one of the prettiest in New England. &quot; Situated on an ancient lake bed surrounded by hills, the valley with fertile meadows was excellent for farming. The Ashuelot River provided water power for sawmill s, gristmill s and tanneries. After the railroad arrived in 1848, numerous other industries were established. Keene became a manufacturing center for wooden-ware, pail s, chairs, sash, shutters, doors, pottery, glass, soap, woolen textiles, shoes, saddle s, mowing machines, carriage s and sleigh s. It also had a brickyard and foundry. Keene was incorporated as a city in 1874, and by 1880 had a population of 6,784. New England manufacturing declined in the 20th century, however, particularly during the Great Depression. Keene is today a center for insurance, education and tourism. The city nevertheless retains a considerable inventory of fine Victorian architecture from its flush mill town era. An example is the Keene Public Library, which occupies a Second Empire mansion built about 1869 by manufacturer Henry Colony.

Batorfalvy, Tatianna N.; and Medalie, Laura U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Geological Survey 1995 ] [ Climate ] Keene is located in a temperate climate zone. It experiences all four seasons quite distinctly. The summers can get very hot. The average high temperature in July is 82, and the record high for Keene is 102. As with other cities in the eastern U.S., periods of high humidity can raise heat indices to near 110. During the summer, Keene can get hit by thunderstorms from the west, but the Green Mountains to the west often break up some of the storms, so that Keene doesn&apos;t usually experience a thunderstorm at full strength. The last time a tornado hit Cheshire County was in 1997. The winters in Keene can be very harsh. The most recent such winter was 2002–2003, when Keene received 112.5 &quot; of snow. The majority of the snowfall in Keene comes from nor&apos;easter s, areas of low pressure that move up the Atlantic coast and strengthen. Many times these storms can produce blizzard conditions across southern New England. Recent examples are the blizzard of 2005 and the blizzard of 2006. Keene is situated in an area where cold air meets the moisture from the south, so oftentimes Keene gets the jackpot with winter storms. Aside from snow, winters can be very cold. Even in the warmest of winters, Keene usually has at least one night below zero. During January 2004, Keene saw highs below freezing 25 of the days including five days in the single digits and one day with a high of zero. Overnight lows dropped below zero 12 times, including 7 nights below −10. The record low in Keene is −31. In addition to the cold temperatures, Keene can receive biting winds that drive the wind chill down below −30. Snow can continue to occur right through the end of April, but on the other end, 80-degree days can begin in late March. Autumn weather is similar. Keene&apos;s first snowfall usually occurs in early November, though the city can also see 60-degree days into mid November. Significant rain events can occur in the spring and fall. For example, record rainfall and flooding with the axis of heaviest rain (around 12 &quot; ) near Keene occurred in October 2005. Another significant flood event occurred in May of the following year.
