(1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 29. } No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor&apos;s life, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 549 to 511 B.C., { Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). } [ 18oNAAAAIAAJ Annales des empereurs du japon,p. 4 4 ] {; Brown, Delmer et al. (1979). Gukanshō, p. 251; Varley, Paul. (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki, p. 89. } near the end of the Jōmon period. [ History ] Modern scholars have come to question the existence of at least the first nine emperors; and Annei&apos;s descendant, Emperor Sujin is the first many agree might have actually existed. { &quot; Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl, &quot; Japan Times. March 27, 2007. } The name Annei-tennō was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. { Brinkley, Frank. (1915). } [ itxxAAAAMAAJ A History of the Japanese People from the Earliest Times to the end of the Meiji Era,p. 21 21 ] {; excerpt, &quot; Posthumous names for the earthly Mikados were invented in the reign of Emperor Kammu (782-805), i.e., after the date of the compilation of the Records and the Chronicles. } Annei is regarded by historians as a &quot; legendary emperor &quot; and there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study. { Kelly, Charles F. &quot; Kofun Culture, &quot; Japanese Archaeology. April 27, 2009. } The reign of Emperor Kimmei (509?–571), the 29th emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession, is the first for which contemporary historiography are able to assign verifiable dates; { Titsingh, } [ 18oNAAAAIAAJ pp. 34-36 34 ] {; Brown, pp. 261-262; Varley, pp. 123-124. } however, the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as &quot; traditional &quot; until the reign of Emperor Kammu (737–806), the 50th sovereign of the Yamato dynasty. { Aston, William. (1896). pp. 109. } In Kojiki and Nihonshoki only his name and genealogy were recorded. The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&apos;s historical existence, and an Imperial misasagi or tomb for Annei is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered which confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned. He is considered to have been the second of eight emperors without specific legends associated with them, also known as the [ &quot; eight undocumented monarchs &quot; 欠史八代, Kesshi-hachidai ]. { Aston, pp. 141-142. } Emperor Annei was either the eldest son { Brown, p. 251. } or the only son of Emperor Suizei. Before his ascension to the throne, he was known as Prince Shikitsu-hiko Tamatemi. { Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric.

Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor Annei. This emperor&apos;s posthumous name literally means &quot; steady tranquillity &quot;. It is undisputed that this identification is Chinese in form and Buddhist in implication, which suggests that the name must have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Annei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the Kojiki. The actual site of Annei&apos;s grave is not known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Annei&apos;s mausoleum. It is formally named Unebi-yama no hitsujisaru Mihodo no i no e no no misasagi. { Ponsonby-Fane, p. 418. } [ See also ] Emperor of Japan List of Emperors of Japan Imperial cult [ Notes ] { Japanese Imperial kamon — a stylized } { chrysanthemum blossom } [ 1 ] [ References ] Aston, William George.
