The station became a depot for produce, particularly cucumbers for a Heinz Company plant. After a blight destroyed the cucumber crops, the farmers grew potatoes. It turned into a bustling New York City suburb in the building boom following World War II. { Hicksville: Bound Together by Railroad Ties - Newsday - Retrieved November 14, 2007 } { Ron Ziel and George H.
