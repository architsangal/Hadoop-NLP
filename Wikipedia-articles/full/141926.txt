After Gaelic later spread in the area, the belief arose that the name derived from the 7th century St Féchín of Fore. The village is known as &quot; Fechan &quot; to the local residents. It has two shops, one of which is no longer a post office, a hairdresser, a church, a doctors&apos; surgery and a primary school &quot; Hoddom Primary School &quot;. It also has three hotels: &quot; The Ecclefechan Hotel &quot; with its white-painted frontage is prominent on the High Street and the main junction in the village; the &quot; Cressfield Hotel &quot; which has an adjoining caravan park; &quot; Kirkconnel Hall Hotel &quot; which sits to the north.
