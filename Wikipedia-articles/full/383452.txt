In 1978, state legislator William A. Craven (1921–1999) won state funding for a North County satellite campus of San Diego State University. In 1989, Gov. George Deukmejian signed another Craven bill which established a CSU campus in San Marcos. The state purchased land in San Marcos, including the former Prohoroff Poultry Farms chicken ranch. The hillside site lies approximately [ 8 mi km ] due east of the Pacific Ocean and [ 35 mi km ] due north of downtown San Diego. Today the campus comprises [ 340 acre ha ]. Bill Stacy was appointed president in June 1989. During the 1989-1990 academic year, Stacy hired 12 &quot; Founding Faculty, &quot; who played an important role in the university&apos;s early years and today are memorialized in Founders Plaza. CSUSM admitted upper division students and held classes from September 1990 through August 1992 in rented facilities in a San Marcos business park, alongside the North County campus of San Diego State University. Groundbreaking for the permanent campus occurred on February 23, 1990. Classes began at the current campus in August 1992. Craven Hall was the third instructional building opened in December 1992, and the largest building up to that time at [ 155000 sqft m2 ]. Since 1992, the campus has been growing steadily. Major additions over the subsequent decade include the Foundation Classroom Buildings (December 1996), University Hall (1998), a second Science building (August 2002) and the Arts building (August 2002). The largest building to date is Kellogg Library, opened January 2004 with nearly [ 200000 sqft m2 ].

For the 2011-2012 academic year, tuition and fees rose to $6,596, a 31% increase attributed to the state&apos;s budget crisis; it is the largest such percentage increase in the United States.
