[ Horus standing.svg Horus was often the ancient Egyptians&apos; national patron god. He was usually depicted as a falcon-headed man wearing the pschent, or a red and white crown, as a symbol of kingship over the entire kingdom of Egypt.

Anubis (in some accounts) or Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys Set Hathor (in one version) Imset y, Hapi, Duamutef, Qebehsenuef and Ihy ] Horus is one of the oldest and most significant deities in ancient Egyptian religion, who was worshipped from at least the late Predynastic period through to Greco-Roman times. Different forms of Horus are recorded in history and these are treated as distinct gods by Egyptologists. { &quot; The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology &quot;, Edited by Donald B. Redford, Horus: by Edmund S. Meltzer, p164–168, Berkley, 2003, ISBN 0-425-19096-X } These various forms may possibly be different perceptions of the same multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or syncretic relationships are emphasized, not necessarily in opposition but complementary to one another, consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality. { &quot; The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology &quot;, Edited by Donald B. Redford, p106 &amp; p165, Berkley, 2003, ISBN 0-425-19096-X } He was most often depicted as a falcon, most likely a lanner or peregrine, or as a man with a falcon head. { Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 202. } The earliest recorded form of Horus is the patron deity of Nekhen in Upper Egypt, who is the first known national god, specifically related to the king who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation of Horus in life and Osiris in death. The most commonly encountered family relationship describes Horus as the son of Isis and Osiris but in another tradition Hathor is regarded as his mother and sometimes as his wife. Horus served many functions in the Egyptian pantheon, most notably being the god of the sky, sun, war and protection. [ Etymology ] [ ḥr &quot; Horus &quot; G5 left egypt ] Horus is recorded in Egyptian hieroglyphs as [ ḥr.w ]; the pronunciation has been reconstructed as * [ Ḥāru ], meaning &quot; falcon &quot;. Additional meanings are thought to have been &quot; the distant one &quot; or &quot; one who is above, over &quot;. { Meltzer, Edmund S. (2002). Horus. In D. B. Redford (Ed.), The ancient gods speak: A guide to Egyptian religion (pp. 164). New York: } { Oxford University Press, USA. } By Coptic times, the name became Hōr. It was adopted into Greek as [ grc Ὥρος ] Hōros. The original name also survives in later Egyptian names such as Har-si-ese literally &quot; Horus, son of Isis &quot;. Horus was also known as Nekheny, meaning &quot; falcon &quot;. Some have proposed that Nekheny may have been another falcon-god, worshipped at Nekhen (city of the hawk), with which Horus was identified from early on. Horus may be shown as a falcon on the Narmer Palette dating from the time of unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. [ Horus and the Pharaoh ] Pyramid texts ca. the 25th Century BC describe the nature of the Pharaoh in different characters as both Horus and Osiris. The Pharaoh as Horus in life became the Pharaoh as Osiris in death, where he was united with the rest of the gods. New incarnations of Horus succeeded the deceased pharaoh on earth in the form of new Pharaohs. The lineage of Horus, the eventual product of unions between the children of Atum, may have been a means to explain and justify Pharaonic power; The gods produced by Atum were all representative of cosmic and terrestrial forces in Egyptian life; by identifying Horus as the offspring of these forces, then identifying him with Atum himself, and finally identifying the Pharaoh with Horus, the Pharaoh theologically had dominion over all the world. The notion of Horus as the Pharaoh seems to have been superseded by the concept of the Pharaoh as the son of Ra during the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt. { Samuel Noah Kramer. Mythologies of the Ancient World. Quadrangle Books: Chicago, 1961. pp. 35–43 } [ Origin mythology ] Horus was born to the goddess Isis after she retrieved all the dismembered body parts of her murdered husband Osiris, except his penis which was thrown into the Nile and eaten by a catfish, [ New York folklore quarterly New York Folklore Society Cornell University Press 1973 29 294 http://books.google.com/books?lr%3D%26amp%3Bcd%3D4%26amp%3Bid%3D92LYAAAAMAAJ%26amp%3Bdq%3Dhorus%2Bisis%2Bosiris%2Bpenis%26amp%3Bq%3Dpenis#search_anchor ] [ The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt Ian Shaw Oxford University Press 2003 0-19-815034-2 ] and used her magic powers to resurrect Osiris and fashion a gold phallus [ Eunuchs and castrati: a cultural history Piotr O.

[ Mythological roles ] [ rˁ-ḥr-3ḫty &quot; Re-Harachte &quot; G9-N27:N27 right egypt ] { Wadjet and wearing the double crown – &apos;&apos;temple of Hatshepsut&apos;&apos; } Horus relief in the temple of Edfu [ Sky god ] { falcon } Since Horus was said to be the sky, he was considered to also contain the sun and moon. It became said that the sun was his right eye and the moon his left, and that they traversed the sky when he, a falcon, flew across it. Later, the reason that the moon was not as bright as the sun was explained by a tale, known as the contestings of Horus and Set, originating as a metaphor for the conquest of Upper Egypt by Lower Egypt in about 3000 BC. In this tale, it was said that Set, the patron of Upper Egypt, and Horus, the patron of Lower Egypt, had battled for Egypt brutally, with neither side victorious, until eventually the gods sided with Horus (see below). As Horus was the ultimate victor he became known as Harsiesis, Heru-ur or Har-Wer ( [ ḥr.w wr ] &apos;Horus the Great&apos;), but more usually translated as Horus the Elder. In the struggle Set had lost a testicle, explaining why the desert, which Set represented, is infertile. Horus&apos; left eye had also been gouged out, which explained why the moon, which it represented, was so weak compared to the sun. Horus was occasionally shown in art as a naked boy with a finger in his mouth sitting on a lotus with his mother. In the form of a youth, Horus was referred to as Neferhor. This is also spelled Nefer Hor, Nephoros or Nopheros ( [ nfr ḥr.w ] ) meaning &apos;The Good Horus&apos;. Wedjat, eye of Horus The Eye of Horus is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection and royal power from deities, in this case from Horus or Ra. The symbol is seen on images of Horus&apos; mother, Isis, and on other deities associated with her. In the Egyptian language, the word for this symbol was &quot; Wedjat &quot;. { Pommerening, Tanja, Die altägyptischen Hohlmaße (Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur, Beiheft 10), Hamburg, Helmut Buske Verlag, 2005 } { M. Stokstad, &quot; Art History &quot; } It was the eye of one of the earliest of Egyptian deities, Wadjet, who later became associated with Bast, Mut, and Hathor as well. Wedjat was a solar deity and this symbol began as her eye, an all seeing eye. In early artwork, Hathor is also depicted with this eye. { Lady of the West at hethert.org } Funerary amulets were often made in the shape of the Eye of Horus. The Wedjat or Eye of Horus is &quot; the central element &quot; of seven &quot; gold, faience, carnelian and lapis lazuli &quot; bracelets found on the mummy of Shoshenq II. { Silverman, op. cit., p.228 } The Wedjat &quot; was intended to protect the king [here] in the afterlife &quot; and to ward off evil. Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern sailors would frequently paint the symbol on the bow of their vessel to ensure safe sea travel. { Charles Freeman, The Legacy of Ancient Egypt, Facts on File, Inc. 1997. p.91 } [ God of war and hunting ] Horus was also said to be a god of war and hunting. The Horus falcon is shown upon a standard on the predynastic Hunters Palette in the &quot; lion hunt &quot;. Thus he became a symbol of majesty and power as well as the model of the pharaohs. The Pharaohs were said to be Horus in human form. Furthermore Nemty, another war god, was later identified as Horus. { The Contendings of Horus and Seth } [ Conqueror of Set ] Horus was told by his mother, Isis, to protect the people of Egypt from Set, the god of the desert, who had killed his father Osiris. { Ancient Egyptian Culture } { Ancient Egypt: the Mythology – Horus } Horus had many battles with Set, not only to avenge his father, but to choose the rightful ruler of Egypt. In these battles, Horus came to be associated with Lower Egypt (where Horus was worshipped), and became its patron. One scene stated how Horus was on the verge of killing Set; but his mother (and Set&apos;s sister), Isis, stopped him. Isis injured Horus, but eventually healed him. { Mythology, published by DBP, Chapter: Egypt&apos;s divine kingship } According to Papyrus Chester-Beatty I, Set is depicted as trying to prove his dominance by seducing Horus and then having intercourse with him. However, Horus places his hand between his thighs and catches Set&apos;s semen, then subsequently throws it in the river, so that he may not be said to have been inseminated by Set. Horus then deliberately spreads his own semen on some lettuce, which was Set&apos;s favorite food. After Set had eaten the lettuce, they went to the gods to try to settle the argument over the rule of Egypt. The gods first listened to Set&apos;s claim of dominance over Horus, and call his semen forth, but it answered from the river, invalidating his claim. Then, the gods listened to Horus&apos; claim of having dominated Set, and call his semen forth, and it answered from inside Set. { Theology WebSite: The 80 Years of Contention Between Horus and Set } { Fleming, Fergus, and Alan Lothian. The Way to Eternity: Egyptian Myth. Duncan Baird Publishers, 1997. pp. 80–81 } However, Set still refused to relent, and the other gods were getting tired from over eighty years of fighting and challenges. Horus and Set challenged each other to a boat race, where they each raced in a boat made of stone. Horus and Set agreed, and the race started. But Horus had an edge: his boat was made of wood painted to resemble stone, rather than true stone. Set&apos;s boat, being made of heavy stone, sank, but Horus&apos;s did not. Horus then won the race, and Set stepped down and officially gave Horus the throne of Egypt. But after the New Kingdom, Set still was considered Lord of the desert and its oases. { Set, God of Confusion, by TeVelde } This myth, along with others, could be seen as an explanation of how the two kingdoms of Egypt (Upper and Lower) came to be united. Horus was seen as the God of Lower Egypt, and Set as the God of Upper Egypt. In this myth, the respective Upper and Lower deities have a fight, through which Horus is the victor. However, some of Horus (representing Lower Egypt) enters into Set (Upper Egypt) thus explaining why Lower Egypt is dominant over Upper Egypt. Set&apos;s regions were then considered to be of the desert. [ Heru-pa-khered (Horus the Younger) ] Horus the Younger, Harpocrates to the Ptolemaic Greeks, is represented in the form of a youth wearing a lock of hair (a sign of youth) on the right of his head. In addition, he usually wears the united crowns of Egypt, the crown of upper Egypt and the crown of lower Egypt. He is a form of the rising sun, representing its earliest light. [ Heru-ur (Horus the Elder) ] { (Louvre Museum), &apos; } { Shen ring s &apos; in his grasp } In this form he represented the god of light and the husband of Hathor. He was one of the oldest gods of ancient Egypt. He became the patron of Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) and the first national god (God of the Kingdom). Later, he also became the patron of the pharaohs, and was called the son of truth. { Heru-ur; Horus the Elder } – signifying his role as an important upholder of Maat. He was seen as a great falcon with outstretched wings whose right eye was the sun and the left one was the moon. In this form, he was sometimes given the title Kemwer, meaning (the) great black (one). The Greek form of Heru-ur (or Har wer) is Haroeris. Other variants include Hor Merti &apos;Horus of the two eyes&apos; and Horkhenti Irti. { Patricia Turner, Charles Russell Coulter, Dictionary of ancient deities, 2001 } [ See also ] Egyptian pantheon Heru-ra-ha Jesus Christ in comparative mythology – contains a study of similarities between Horus and Jesus.
