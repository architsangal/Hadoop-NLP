It revolves around the eponymous Carrie, a shy high-school girl, who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who tease her. King has commented that he finds the work to be &quot; raw &quot; and &quot; with a surprising power to hurt and horrify. &quot; It is one of the most frequently banned books in United States schools.

Several adaptations of Carrie have been released, including a 1976 feature film, a 1988 Broadway musical, a 1999 feature film sequel, and a 2002 television movie. The book is dedicated to King&apos;s wife Tabitha : &quot; This is for Tabby, who got me into it – and then bailed me out of it. &quot; [ Publication history ] Carrie was actually King&apos;s fourth novel { &quot; I had written three other novels before Carrie… &quot; King, Stephen, (2000) } { On Writing. Scribner Books. p. 77 } but the first to be published. It was written while he was living in a trailer in Hermon, Maine, on a portable typewriter (on which he also wrote Misery ) that belonged to his wife Tabitha. It began as a short story intended for Cavalier magazine, but King tossed the first three pages of his work in the garbage. { &quot; I did three single-spaced pages of a first draft, then crumpled them up in disgust and threw them away. &quot; King, Stephen. (2000) } { On Writing. Scribner Books. p. 76 } Of King&apos;s published short stories at the time, he recalled, [ Some woman said, &apos;You write all those macho things, but you can&apos;t write about women.&apos; I said, &apos;I&apos;m not scared of women. I could write about them if I wanted to.&apos; So I got an idea for a story about this incident in a girls&apos; shower room, and the girl would be telekinetic. The other girls would pelt her with sanitary napkins when she got her period. The period would release the right hormone s and she would rain down destruction on them… I did the shower scene, but I hated it and threw it away. &quot; Stephen King: &apos;I Like to go for the Jugular&apos; &quot; Grant, Charles L. Twilight Zone Magazine vol 1 no 1 April 1981 ] His wife fished the pages out of the garbage and encouraged him to finish the story; he followed her advice and expanded it into a novel. { Introduction to &quot; Carrie &quot; (Collector&apos;s Edition) King, Tabitha Plume 1991 } King said, &quot; I persisted because I was dry and had no better ideas… my considered opinion was that I had written the world&apos;s all-time loser. &quot; [ King Stephen Stephen King 1980 February On Becoming a Brand Name Adelina Magazine 44 ] Carrie is based on a composite of two girls Stephen King went to school with. [ She was a very peculiar girl who came from a very peculiar family. Her mother wasn&apos;t a religious nut like the mother in Carrie; she was a game nut, a sweepstakes nut who subscribed to magazines for people who entered contests  … the girl had one change of clothes for the entire school year, and all the other kids made fun of her. I have a very clear memory of the day she came to school with a new outfit she&apos;d bought herself. She was a plain-looking country girl, but she&apos;d changed the black skirt and white blouse – which was all anybody had ever seen her in – for a bright-colored checkered blouse with puffed sleeves and a skirt that was fashionable at the time. And everybody made worsefun of her because nobody wanted to see her change the mold. ] King says he wondered what it would have been like to have been raised by such a mother, and based the story itself on a reversal of the Cinderella fairy tale. He also told biographer George Beahm that the girl later &quot; married a man who was as odd as her, had kids, and eventually killed herself. &quot; [ Stephen King From A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work Beahm George 1998-09-01 Andrews McMeel Pub. Kansas City 0-8362-6914-4 ] Carrie’s telekinesis resulted from King’s earlier reading about this topic. King also did a short stint as a high school English teacher at Hampden Academy, a job he eventually quit after receiving the payment for the paperback publishing sale of Carrie. At the time of publication, King was working as a teacher at Hampden Academy and barely making ends meet. To cut down on expenses, King had the phone company remove the telephone from his house. As a result, when King received word that the book was chosen for publication, his phone was out of service. Doubleday editor William Thompson (who would eventually become King&apos;s close friend), sent a telegram to King&apos;s house which read: &quot; Carrie Officially A Doubleday Book. $2,500 Advance Against Royalties. Congrats, Kid - The Future Lies Ahead, Bill. &quot; It has been presumed that King drew inspiration from his time as a teacher. New American Library bought the paperback rights for $400,000, which, according to King&apos;s contract with Doubleday, was split between them. { &quot; The Stephen King Companion &quot; Beahm, George Andrews McMeel press 1989 pp. 171–173 } King eventually quit the teaching job after receiving the publishing payment. The hardback sold a mere 13,000 copies, the paperback, released a year later, sold over 1 million copies in its first year. King recalls, &quot; Carrie was written after Rosemary&apos;s Baby, but before The Exorcist, which really opened up the field. I didn&apos;t expect much of Carrie. I thought who&apos;d want to read a book about a poor little girl with menstrual problems? I couldn&apos;t believe I was writing it. &quot; { &quot; From Textbook to Checkbook &quot; Wells, Robert W. Milwaukee Journal Sep 15, 1980 } In a talk at the University of Maine at Orono, King said of Carrie, &quot; I&apos;m not saying that Carrie is shit and I&apos;m not repudiating it. She made me a star, but it was a young book by a young writer. In retrospect it reminds me of a cookie baked by a first grader — tasty enough, but kind of lumpy and burned on the bottom. &quot; The book sold sixteen million copies. [ Plot summary ] The book uses false document s to frame the story of high school student Carietta &quot; Carrie &quot; White, and how she singlehandedly destroyed the town of Chamberlain, Maine, and caused one of the worst disasters in American history. For years, Carrie has been abused at home by her unstable Christian fundamentalist mother, Margaret White. She does not fare much better at Thomas Ewen High School; since first grade, she has been the focus of bullying her for her religious beliefs, her outdated clothing and her unattractive appearance. At the beginning of the novel, Carrie has her first period while showering after gym class. Carrie is terrified, having no concept of menstruation; her mother never spoke to her about it, and she has been a social outcast throughout high school. Instead of sympathizing with the frightened Carrie, her classmates throw tampon s and sanitary napkin s at her. As Carrie is aided by her gym teacher, Rita Desjardin, a light bulb in the shower burns out. As punishment, the girls involved in the shower episode serve a week&apos;s detention in the gym. One of the girls, Chris Hargensen, refuses to attend and is suspended for three days, as well as banned from Ewen High&apos;s prom. Meanwhile, Sue Snell, another girl, feels remorse for her prior actions and offers to become Carrie&apos;s friend. Meanwhile, Carrie gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, trying to keep them under control. With prom fast approaching, Sue sets Carrie up with her handsome boyfriend, Tommy Ross. Carrie&apos;s mother tries to force her not to go, but Carrie uses her powers to help stand up for herself. Chris and her boyfriend, Billy Nolan, hatch a plan to humiliate Carrie in front of the entire school. Chris has Billy fill two buckets with pig blood, and rigs them over the stage on a rafter hidden out of sight. On prom night, Carrie is tormented by her mother begging for her not to leave the house. Carrie leaves anyway and arrives with Tommy. Carrie is nervous at first, but everyone begins treating her equally. Soon Carrie begins enjoying herself and Tommy begins to become attracted to her. Meanwhile, Sue continually worries about what&apos;s happening at the prom—and at the same time worries if she&apos;s pregnant. Carrie and Tommy are elected prom king and queen after Chris&apos;s henchwoman, Tina Blake, exchanges fake ballots for the real ones. Once on stage, Chris drenches Carrie and Tommy with the pig blood. Everyone begins pointing and laughing. A bucket knocks Tommy unconscious and Carrie runs out of the gym. She is tripped, gets back up, and rushes outside. Contemplating her life in solitary confinement, she remembers her power and goes back to exact revenge on everyone who tormented her. She locks the doors and turns on the sprinkler system. But after viewing two kids die of electrocution, her mind finally snaps; she decides to set fire to the gym. She leaves the prom-goers and chaperones to die in the fire, including Tommy. Miss Desjardin and a few other students manage to survive the destruction by fleeing through the fire escape. Carrie leaves the school and begins to destroy Chamberlain, blowing up a gas station, and setting her entire neighborhood on fire. She also destroys the town&apos;s fire hydrants, preventing any attempt at putting out the fires. Notably, Carrie goes to a cathedral, where she prays, all the while manipulating a series of power lines outside, killing several civilians surveying the event. Sue rushes to the school and watches it explode, which destroys a portion of the town. Carrie makes her way home and confronts her mother, who has now gone completely mad, and tells Carrie of the night she was raped and conceived her before stabbing her in the shoulder with a carving knife. In retaliation, Carrie kills her mother by stopping her heart. Mortally wounded, Carrie then makes her way to the local roadhouse where her father got drunk and raped her mother the night she was conceived. Chris and Billy, who happened to be making love inside, receive word from Billy&apos;s friend of what has happened to Chamberlain, and Billy plans on leaving town with Chris. They exit the roadhouse just as Carrie arrives, and attempt to run her down with Billy&apos;s car, but Carrie telekinetically sends the car crashing into the roadhouse, killing Chris and Billy. Carrie then collapses in the parking lot from blood loss. Sue then goes to the roadhouse where she finds Carrie in the parking lot. Carrie talks telepathically with Sue and blames her for the prank, but after scanning Sue&apos;s brain, she finds out that Sue had no idea of the prank and that she had set her up with Tommy to apologize for the gym shower incident. Carrie does not forgive Sue, but believes her and then cries out for her mother before dying from the stab wound in her shoulder. Terror-stricken, Sue runs away from the roadhouse and after distancing herself from it, she collapses and has her period, meaning that she miscarried if pregnant. A month later, Chamberlain becomes a ghost town, and the &apos;Black Prom&apos; incident hits the nation harder than the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After interviewing the survivors of the prom, science begins to take telekinesis seriously. Miss Desjardin, consumed with guilt over not being able to help Carrie, retires from teaching. Sue writes a memoir of her experience entitled My Name is Susan Snell, which warns the reader not to forget about the events that took place in Chamberlain, otherwise something like it may happen again. The book closes with a letter written by a woman in Tennessee whose niece is developing telekinetic powers.

Screenwritten by Lawrence D. Cohen and directed by Brian De Palma, the film starred Sissy Spacek as Carrie, along with Piper Laurie as Margaret, Amy Irving as Sue, Nancy Allen as Chris, John Travolta as Billy, Betty Buckley as Miss Desjardin a.k.a. Miss Collins, and William Katt as Tommy. It is regarded as a watershed film of the horror genre and one of the best film adaptations of a Stephen King work. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie received Academy Award nominations for their performances. In 1988, a Broadway musical of the same name starring Betty Buckley, Linzi Hateley, and Darlene Love closed after only five performances and 16 previews, leading to it being viewed as one of the biggest Broadway flops of all time. A sequel titled The Rage: Carrie 2 was released in 1999, based on the premise was that Carrie&apos;s father had numerous affairs and had another daughter with telekinetic powers. Sue Snell, the only survivor of the prom, also appears, now a school counselor. The film was both a commercial and critical failure. In 2002, a made-for-television movie of the same name was released, starring Angela Bettis, Emilie de Ravin and Patricia Clarkson. However, in this version, Carrie survives the end of the story, which was supposed to have led to a television series. Playwright Erik Jackson acquired King&apos;s consent to stage a non-musical spoof, which premiered Off-Broadway in 2006 with female impersonator Keith Levy (also known as Sherry Vine) in the lead role. In 2011, MGM and Screen Gems gained rights to make a new film version with Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa &apos;s hand at the screenplay, and directed by Kimberly Peirce, known for her work on Boys Don&apos;t Cry. The film is said to be &quot; less a remake of the De Palma film and more a re-adaptation of the original text &quot;. Stephen King has expressed interest in casting Lindsay Lohan for the role of Carrie. However, it was announced on March 28, 2012, actress Chloë Grace Moretz landed the role of Carrie. The reboot is said to be released March 13, 2013. Alongside Moretz, Julianne Moore will guest star as Carrie&apos;s mother Margaret White, and Gabriella Wilde as Sue Snell. http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Julianne-Moore-Gabriella-Wilde-Board-Carrie-Remake-30909.html Alex Russell and Broadway actor Ansel Elgort are also in the main cast. http://upandcomers.net/2012/05/15/chronicle-star-alex-russell-and-broadway-actor-ansel-elgort-join-carrie-remake-opposite-chloe-moretz/ [ References ] [ External links ] [ Carrie (novel) Carrie ] Official website for &apos;&apos;Carrie&apos;&apos; the Musical Identification characteristics for first edition copies of Carrie!
