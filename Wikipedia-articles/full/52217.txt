[ the article about when a brokerage client purchases shares beyond his or her means free riding ] [ July 2011 ] In economics, collective bargaining, psychology, and political science, a free rider (or freeloader) is someone who enjoys the benefits of an activity without paying for it. The free rider may withhold effort or resources, or may impose the costs of his or her activities on others. The free rider problem is the question of how to limit free riding (or its negative effects). One consequence of free riding is the excessive use of a common property resource : because people do not take into account the impacts of their actions on others, they take too much from the common pool. In public economics, free riding can lead to the non-production or under-production of a public good. In both of these cases, free riding leads to Pareto inefficiency. Free riding can, however, have positive consequences. For example, a member of a cartel who increases his or her output, &quot; free riding &quot; upon the efforts of others, is actually contributing to greater economic efficiency. The term free rider comes from the example of someone using public transport ation without paying the fare. If too many people do this, the system will not have enough money to operate. Another example of a free rider is someone who does not pay his or her share of taxes, which help pay for public good s that all citizens benefit from, such as roads, water treatment plants, and fire services. [ Bargaining ] When bargaining, players often bid less than they are prepared to pay in the hope of improving their positions. This creates problems because it is impossible to discover the players&apos; true demand payoff curves, and therefore inefficient allocation of resources is likely to result. In the context of labor union s, a free rider is an employee who pays no union dues or agency shop fees, but nonetheless receives the same benefits of union representation as dues-payers. Under U.S. law, unions owe a duty of fair representation to all workers that they represent, regardless of whether they pay dues. Free riding has been a point of legal and political contention for decades. [ Gurley Fred 1954 May Unalienable Rights versus Union Shop Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science 26 1 58–70 1173610 10.2307/1173610 The Academy of Political Science ] In Canadian labour law, the Rand formula (also referred to as automatic check-off) is a workplace situation in which the payment of trade union dues is mandatory, regardless of the worker&apos;s opinion about the union. [ Empirical significance ] There is considerable debate about the empirical significance of free riding. One famous article asked &quot; Economists free ride. Does anyone else? &quot; [ Marwell Gerald Ruth E. Ames Economists Free Ride, Does Anyone Else? Experiments on the provision of public goods Journal of Public Economics 1981 June 15 3 295-310 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004727278190013X 23 May 2012 ] Studies generally find that there is some free riding, but less than one would expect based on the predictions of economic theory. Free-riding is most likely to occur in large, anonymous groups, in one-off interactions, and when the stakes are high. The research of Elinor Ostrom and others has found that social norms and institutions can limit the extent of free riding by sanctioning those who do not contribute, or take more than their share from the common pool. [ Ostrom Elinor Collective Action and the Evolution of Social Norms Journal of Economic Perspectives 2000 14 3 137-158 http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/reprints/R00_11.pdf 23 May 2012 ] [ Perception of free riders ] Those seen as free riders are often resented because they are thought to be taking more than their fair share of a resource or failing to shoulder any part of the cost of it. They cause teams to perform less well because other members become less willing to contribute when they think that one or more members are free riding. { http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeA/2003/03A42/03a42.pdf } People also dislike those they perceive to be free riders because they have a strong aversion to being a sucker (see &quot; sucker effect &quot; ).
