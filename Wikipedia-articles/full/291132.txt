Kennedy, an Irish American, was the father of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, United States Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, United States Senator Edward M. Kennedy, naval officer Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., Special Olympics co-founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver, and former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith; and the grandfather of U.S. Representatives Joseph P. Kennedy II and Patrick J. Kennedy. He was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. He was the inaugural Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), and later directed the Maritime Commission. Kennedy served as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 until late 1940, including the early part of World War II. Born to a political family in Boston, Massachusetts, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. was educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard University, and embarked on a career in finance, making a large fortune as a stock market and commodity investor and by investing in real estate and a wide range of industries. { &quot; Joseph P Kennedy &quot;, } { John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Retrieved January 7, 2012. } At the repeal of Prohibition, Kennedy and FDR&apos;s son James Roosevelt traveled to Scotland to buy distribution rights for Scotch whiskey. In addition, Kennedy had purchased spirits-importation rights from Schenley Industries, a firm in Canada. { Richard J. Whalen, The Founding Father, 1964. } During World War I, he was an assistant general manager of Bethlehem Steel and developed a friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Kennedy made huge profits from reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood studios, ultimately merging several acquisitions into Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) studios. After Prohibition ended in 1933, Kennedy consolidated an even larger fortune when his company, Somerset Importers, became the exclusive American agent for Gordon&apos;s Gin and Dewar&apos;s Scotch. He owned the largest office building in the country, Chicago &apos;s Merchandise Mart, giving his family an important base in that city and an alliance with the Irish-American political leadership there. His term as ambassador and his political ambitions ended abruptly during the Battle of Britain in November 1940, with the publishing of his controversial remarks suggesting that &quot; Democracy is finished in England. It may be here, [in the US]. &quot; { Boston Sunday Globe of November 10, 1940. } Kennedy resigned under pressure shortly afterwards. In later years, Kennedy worked behind the scenes to continue building the financial and political fortunes of the Kennedy family. After a disabling stroke on December 19, 1961, at the age of 73, Kennedy lost all power of speech, but remained mentally intact. He used a wheelchair after the stroke. Kennedy was one of three fathers (the other two being Dr. George Tryon Harding, Sr. and George H. W. Bush ) to live through the entire presidency of a son. He died on November 18, 1969, two months after his 81st birthday. Kennedy allowed surgeons to perform a lobotomy (one of the earliest in the U.S.) on his daughter Rosemary Kennedy in 1941. Various reasons for the operation have been given, but it left her permanently incapacitated.

Murawski, Sally Spencer Corwin Press 2011 3 ] [ Background and education ] Kennedy yearbook photo from Boston Latin School Joseph Patrick Kennedy was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He was the elder son of Mary Augusta Hickey Kennedy and P. J. Kennedy, a successful businessman, ward boss and Irish American community leader. All of Kennedy&apos;s grandparents had emigrated to Massachusetts in the 1840s to escape the Irish famine. Kennedy was born into a highly sectarian society, where Irish Catholics felt themselves excluded by upper-class Boston Brahmins. Boston Irish became thus active in the Democratic Party, including P. J. and numerous relatives. P. J. Kennedy&apos;s home was comfortable, thanks to his successful saloon business, investments, and an influential role in local politics. His mother encouraged Joseph to attend the Boston Latin School, where Joe was a below average scholar but was popular among his classmates, winning election as class president and playing on the school baseball team. Kennedy followed in the footsteps of older cousins by attending Harvard College. He focused on becoming a social leader, working energetically to gain admittance to the prestigious Hasty Pudding Club. While at Harvard he joined the Delta Upsilon International fraternity and played on the baseball team, but was blackballed from the Porcellian Club. [ Marriage and family ] { Rose (shown with Joseph Jr.) married Joseph after college. } { Hyannis Port, Massachusetts } On October 7, 1914, Kennedy married Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the eldest daughter of John Francis &quot; Honey Fitz &quot; Fitzgerald, a Democratic mayor of Boston and probably the most recognized politician in the city. The marriage joined two of the city&apos;s most prominent Irish-American political families. The couple had nine children. As Kennedy&apos;s business success expanded, he and his family kept homes in the Boston area, suburban New York City, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Palm Beach, Florida.

Married 1956 to Stephen Edward Smith; 1993–1998 U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. 77 Married 1958 to Joan Bennett, divorced in 1982; remarried in 1992 to Victoria Reggie. Served as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1962 to his death in 2009 due to brain cancer. [ Lobotomy ] Kennedy&apos;s daughter Rosemary was 23 years old when her father okayed an experimental prefrontal lobotomy, one of the first performed in the U.S. She has been termed &quot; mentally retarded &quot; and she may have been &quot; mentally ill &quot; (no treatment other than incarceration existed for that in the 1940s). { Kessler, p. 242 } The lobotomy went terribly wrong, and left her incapacitated for life (she died in 2005 at age 88). Rosemary&apos;s name &quot; was never mentioned in the house &quot;, said Janet Des Rosiers, Kennedy secretary and mistress of Joseph for nine years. { Kessler, pp. 2, 247 } Dr. Bertram S. Brown, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said later that Joseph called his daughter Rosemary mentally retarded rather than mentally ill in order to protect John&apos;s reputation for a presidential run, and that the family&apos;s &quot; lack of support for mental illness is part of a lifelong family denial of what was really so &quot;. { Kessler, pp. 252–253 } [ Business career ] Kennedy made a large fortune as a stock market and commodity investor and by investing in real estate and a wide range of industries. He never built a significant business from scratch, but his timing as both buyer and seller was usually excellent. Sometimes he made use of inside information in ways which were legal at the time but were later outlawed. He later became the first chairman of the SEC. After his death, various gangster s including Frank Costello claimed to have associated with Kennedy. According to some accounts, [ December 2011 ] Kennedy was associated in the &quot; bear raid &quot; that precipitated the Wall Street Crash of 1929, as well as much of the bootlegging activity that was common at the time. [ December 2011 ] When Fortune magazine published its first list of the richest people in the United States in 1957, it placed him in the $200–400 million band [ Smith Richard Austin The Fifty-Million-Dollar Man, (sidebar: &quot; America&apos;s Biggest Fortunes &quot; ) Fortune November 1, 1957 ] ($ [ US 0.2 1957 2 ] – [ US 400000000 1957 2 ] today [ US ] ), meaning that it estimated him to be between the ninth and sixteenth richest person in the United States at that time. [ Early ventures ] Kennedy claimed to be America&apos;s youngest bank president. After graduating from Harvard in 1912, he took his first job as a state-employed bank examiner. This allowed him to learn a great deal about the banking industry. In 1913, the Columbia Trust Bank, in which his father held a significant share, was under threat of takeover. Kennedy, borrowing $45,000 ($ [ US 45000 1913 0 ] today [ US ] ) from family and friends, bought back control and at age 25 was rewarded by being elected the bank&apos;s president. Kennedy told the press he was &quot; the youngest &quot; bank president in America. { Kessler, p. 25 } Kennedy emerged as a highly successful entrepreneur with an eye for value. For example, as a real estate investor, he turned a handsome profit from ownership of Old Colony Realty Associates, Inc., which bought distressed real estate. { Kessler, p. 27 } Although skeptical of American involvement in World War I, he sought to participate in war-time production as an assistant general-manager of a major Bethlehem Steel shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. There he oversaw the production of transports and warships critical to the war. This job brought him into contact with the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [ Wall Street and stock market investments ] In 1919, he joined the prominent stock broker age firm of Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. where he became an expert in dealing in the unregulated stock market of the day, engaging in tactics that were later labeled insider trading and market manipulation. He happened to be on the corner of Wall and Broad Streets at the moment of the Wall Street bombing on September 16, 1920, and was thrown to the ground by the force of the blast. { Beverly Gage, The Day Wall Street Exploded, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 156. } In 1923 he left Hayden, and set up his own investment company, becoming a multi-millionaire during the bull market of the 1920s, and even more wealthy as a result of taking &quot; short &quot; positions in 1929. David Kennedy, author of Freedom From Fear, describes the Wall Street of the Kennedy era: [ [It] was a strikingly information-starved environment. Many firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or issued reports whose data were so arbitrarily selected and capriciously audited as to be worse than useless. It was this circumstance that had conferred such awesome power on a handful of investment bankers like J.P. Morgan, because they commanded a virtual monopoly of the information necessary for making sound financial decisions. Especially in the secondary market s, where reliable information was all but impossible for the average investor to come by, opportunities abounded for insider manipulation and wildcat speculation. ] [ The Crash ] Kennedy formed alliances with several other Irish-Catholic investors, including Charles E. Mitchell, Michael J. Meehan and Bernard Smith. He helped establish the Libby-Owens-Ford stock pool, an arrangement in which Kennedy and colleagues created a scarcity of Libby-Owens-Ford stock to drive up the value of their own holdings in the stock, using inside information and the public&apos;s lack of knowledge. Pool operators would bribe journalists to present information in the most advantageous manner. Attempts to corner stocks were made that would cause the price to go up, and bear raid s could cause the price to collapse downward. Kennedy got into a bidding war seeking control of founder John Hertz &apos;s company Yellow Cab. { The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys (1987) by Doris Kearns Goodwin pp. 330–333 } Kennedy later claimed he knew the rampant stock speculation of the late 1920s would lead to a crash. It is said that he knew it was time to get out of the market when he received stock tips from a shoe-shine boy. { &quot; Ecommerce: Who wants to be a millionaire &quot;, Computer Business Review, February 2000. } Kennedy survived the crash &quot; because he possessed a passion for facts, a complete lack of sentiment and a marvelous sense of timing &quot;. { &quot; Essay: The Merits of Speculation &quot;, Time, September 22, 1967. } During the Great Depression Kennedy vastly increased his financial fortune by investing most of it in real estate. In 1929, Kennedy&apos;s fortune was estimated to be $4 million (equivalent to $ [ US 4000000 1929 2 ] today [ US ] ). By 1935, his wealth had increased to $180 million (equivalent to $ [ US 180000000 1935 2 ] today [ US ] ). [ Investments in movie production, liquor importing, and real estate ] { Sadie Thompson &apos;&apos; starring } { Gloria Swanson would jeopardize the ability of the movie industry to censor itself. Swanson needed financing for her movie production company, and Kennedy began a three-year affair when he met her for lunch in New York after the film&apos;s release. Kessler, pp. 60–61. } Kennedy made huge profits from reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood studios. Film production in the US was much more decentralized than it is today, with many different movie studios producing film product. One small studio was FBO, Film Booking Offices of America, which specialized in Westerns produced cheaply. Its owner was in financial trouble and asked Kennedy to help find a new owner. Kennedy formed his own group of investors and bought it for $1.5 million ($ [ US 1500000 1925 2 ] today [ US ] ). Kennedy moved to Hollywood in March 1926 to focus on running the studio. Movie studios were then permitted to own exhibition companies which were necessary to get their films on local screens. With that in mind, in a hostile buyout, he acquired the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Theaters Corporation (KAO) which had more than 700 vaudeville movie theaters across the United States. He later purchased another production studio called Pathe Exchange, and merged those two entities with Cecil B. DeMille &apos;s Producers Distributing Corporation in March 1927. In October 1928, he formally merged his film companies FBO and KAO to form Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) and made a large amount of money in the process. Then, keen to buy the Pantages Theatre chain, which had 63 profitable theaters, Kennedy made an offer of $8 million ($ [ US 8000000 1928 2 ] today). It was declined. He then stopped distributing his movies to Pantages. Still, Alexander Pantages declined to sell. However, when Pantages was later charged and tried for rape, his reputation took a battering and he accepted Kennedy&apos;s revised offer of $3.5 million ($ [ US 3500000 1928 2 ] today [ US ] ). Pantages, who claimed that Kennedy had &quot; set him up &quot;, was later being found not guilty at a second trial. It is estimated that Kennedy made over $5 million ($ [ US 5000000 1928 2 ] today [ US ] ) from his investments in Hollywood. During his three-year affair with film star Gloria Swanson, { Beauchamp, Cari (2009) Joseph Kennedy Presents: His Hollywood Years pp. 263–5, Knopf, New York. ISBN 978-1-4000-4000-1 } he arranged the financing for her films The Love of Sunya (1927) and the ill-fated Queen Kelly (1928). The duo also used Hollywood&apos;s famous &quot; body sculptor &quot;, masseuse Sylvia of Hollywood. Their relationship ended when Swanson wondered why an expensive gift from Joseph had been charged to her account. { Kessler, p. 86. } { James Roosevelt, son of President } { Franklin D. Roosevelt, helped Kennedy start his liquor business after Prohibition. Kessler, pp. 106–107. } A recurring story about Kennedy is that he made money in bootlegging, the illegal importation and distribution of alcohol during Prohibition. Although there is no hard evidence of this, Kennedy did have extensive investments in the legal importation of spirits. The &quot; bootlegging &quot; story itself may be traceable to Canadian distiller Samuel Bronfman and to New England bootlegger Danny Walsh and his crime syndicate, which did in fact smuggle spirits across the Canadian–American border during this period. Post-Prohibition, Bronfman had a bitter rivalry with Kennedy in acquiring North American liquor distribution rights. { Michael R. Marrus, Samuel Bronfman: The Life and Times of Seagram&apos;s Mr. Sam } At the start of the Franklin Roosevelt administration, Kennedy and James Roosevelt founded Somerset Importers, an entity that acted as the exclusive American agent for Haig &amp; Haig Scotch, Gordon&apos;s Dry Gin and Dewar&apos;s Scotch. They had assembled a large inventory of stock, which they allegedly sold for a profit of millions of dollars when Prohibition was repealed. (Kennedy himself drank little alcohol. He so disapproved of what he considered a stereotypical Irish vice that he offered his sons $1,000 to not drink until they turned 21. { Leamer 308 } ) Kennedy invested this money in residential and commercial real estate in New York, Le Pavillon restaurant, and Hialeah Park Race Track in Hialeah, Florida. His most important purchase was the largest office building in the country, Chicago &apos;s Merchandise Mart, which gave his family an important base in that city and an alliance with the Irish-American political leadership there. [ SEC Chairman ] Kennedy&apos;s first major involvement in a national political campaign was his support in 1932 for Franklin D. Roosevelt &apos;s bid for the Presidency. He donated, loaned, and raised a substantial amount of money for the campaign. Roosevelt rewarded him with an appointment as the inaugural Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Kennedy had hoped for a Cabinet post, such as Secretary of the Treasury. After Franklin Roosevelt called Joe to Washington, D.C. to clean up the securities industry, somebody asked FDR why he had tapped such a crook. &quot; Takes one to catch one, &quot; replied Roosevelt. { Sidey, Hugh (June 14, 1999), &quot; The Dynasty The Kennedys &quot;, Time. } Kennedy&apos;s reforming work as SEC Chairman was widely praised on all sides, as investors realized the SEC was protecting their interests. His knowledge of the financial markets equipped him to identify areas requiring the attention of regulators. One of the crucial reforms was the requirement for companies to regularly file financial statements with the SEC, which broke what some saw as an information monopoly maintained by the Morgan banking family. He left the SEC in 1935 to take over the Maritime Commission, which built on his wartime experience in running a major shipyard. [ Disputes with Father Charles Coughlin ] Father Charles Coughlin was an Irish-Canadian priest in Detroit, who became perhaps the most prominent Roman Catholic spokesman on political and financial issues in the 1930s, with a radio audience that reached millions every week. A strong supporter of Roosevelt in 1932, Coughlin broke with the president in 1934 who became a bitter opponent of his weekly, anti-communist, anti-Semitic, anti-Federal Reserve and isolationist radio talks. Roosevelt sent Kennedy and other prominent Irish Catholics to try to tone down Coughlin. { Leamer 93; Brinkley 127. } Coughlin swung his support to Huey Long in 1935 and then to William Lemke &apos;s Union Party in 1936. Kennedy strongly supported the New Deal and believed as early as 1933 that Coughlin was &quot; becoming a very dangerous proposition &quot; as an opponent of Roosevelt and &quot; an out and out demagogue &quot;. In 1936, Kennedy worked with Roosevelt, Bishop Francis Spellman and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII ) to shut Coughlin down. { Maier pp 103–107 } When Coughlin returned to the air in 1940, Kennedy continued to battle against his influence among Irish Americans. { Smith pp. 122, 171, 379, 502; Alan Brinkley, Voices of Protest (1984) p. 127; Michael Kazin, The Populist persuasion (1995) pp. 109, 123. } [ Ambassador to Britain ] Kennedy&apos;s UK Ambassador nomination In 1938, Roosevelt appointed Kennedy as the United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James&apos;s (the United Kingdom ) in London. Kennedy hugely enjoyed his leadership position in London high society, which stood in stark contrast to his relative outsider status in Boston. His daughter Kathleen married the heir to the Duke of Devonshire, the head of one of England&apos;s grandest aristocratic families. Kennedy rejected the warnings of the prominent Member of Parliament Winston Churchill that any compromise with Nazi Germany was impossible. Instead, Kennedy supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain &apos;s apparent policy of appeasement. Throughout 1938, while the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany and Austria intensified, Kennedy attempted to arrange a meeting with Adolf Hitler. { Hersh 64. } Shortly before the Nazi aerial bombing of British cities began in September 1940, Kennedy once again sought a personal meeting with Hitler, again without the approval of the Department of State, &quot; to bring about a better understanding between the United States and Germany &quot;. { Hersh 63. } It has been surmised that Kennedy also had personal reasons for wanting to avoid war; &quot; He feared for the lives of his three eldest sons, Joe, Jack and Bobby, all of whom were or soon would be eligible to serve. &quot; { &quot; Presidential Courage: Brave Leaders and How They Changed America 1789–1989 &quot; } Kennedy also argued strongly against giving military and economic aid to the United Kingdom. &quot; Democracy is finished in England. It may be here, &quot; he stated in the Boston Sunday Globe of November 10, 1940. With Nazi German troops having overrun Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France, and with bombs falling daily on Great Britain, Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief that this war was not about saving democracy from National Socialism (Nazism) or from Fascism. In an interview with two newspaper journalists, Louis M. Lyons, of the Boston Globe, and Ralph Coghlan, of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Kennedy opined: [ It&apos;s all a question of what we do with the next six months. The whole reason for aiding England is to give us time  ... As long as she is in there, we have time to prepare. It isn&apos;t that [Britain is] fighting for democracy. That&apos;s the bunk. She&apos;s fighting for self-preservation, just as we will if it comes to us  ... I know more about the European situation than anybody else, and it&apos;s up to me to see that the country gets it. Boston Sunday Globe of November 10, 1940 ] His views were becoming inconsistent and increasingly isolationist; British MP Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood, who had himself opposed the British Government&apos;s earlier appeasement policy, said of Kennedy: [ Davis John H. The Kennedys: Dynasty and Disaster 1993 S.P.I. Books 978-1-56171-060-7 94 http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dngbia3tOBQIC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA94%26amp%3Bdq%3Djosiah%2Bwedgwood ] In British government circles during the Blitz, Kennedy was widely disparaged as a defeatist. He retreated to the countryside during the bombings of London by German aircraft, at a time when the British Royal Family, Prime Minister, government ministers, and other ambassadors chose to stay in London. When the American public and Roosevelt Administration officials read his quotes on democracy being &quot; finished &quot;, and his belief that the Battle of Britain wasn&apos;t about &quot; fighting for democracy &quot;, all of it being just &quot; bunk &quot;, they realized that Kennedy could not be trusted to represent the United States. [ December 2011 ] In the face of national public outcry, and pressure from the Roosevelt Department of State, which no longer wanted him, Kennedy submitted his resignation late in November 1940. [ December 2011 ] [ Reduced influence ] Throughout the rest of the war, relations between Kennedy and the Roosevelt Administration remained tense (especially when Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., vocally opposed President Roosevelt&apos;s unprecedented nomination for a third term, which began in 1941). Kennedy may have wanted to run for president himself in 1940 or later. Having effectively removed himself from the national stage, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., sat out World War II on the sidelines. However, Kennedy did stay active in the smaller venues of rallying Irish-American and Roman Catholic Democrats to vote for Roosevelt&apos;s re-election for a fourth term in 1944. Former Ambassador Kennedy claimed to be eager to help the war effort, but as a result of his previous gaffes, he was neither trusted nor invited to do so. { Leamer pp. 152–53; William E. Leuchtenburg, In the Shadow of FDR: From Harry Truman to George W. Bush (2001) pp. 68–72 } Due to his philanthropy and a close friendship with Francis Spellman, Archbishop of New York (later Cardinal), during this time, Joseph Kennedy was invested as a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, an honor which at that time he shared with just a few dozen Americans. With his own ambitions to achieve the White House in self-inflicted destruction, Joseph Kennedy held out great hope for his eldest son, Joseph Kennedy, Jr., to seek the Presidency. However, Joseph Kennedy, Jr., who had become a U.S. Navy bomber pilot, was killed over the English Channel while undertaking Operation Aphrodite, a high-risk, new way to use heavy bombers to strike German missile sites in France, in 1944. His bomber accidentally detonated early, before Kennedy could bail out. After grieving over his dead son, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., then turned his attention to grooming his second son, John F. Kennedy, for a run for the Presidency. After serving as a member of the House of Representatives beginning in 1946, and then a U.S. Senator beginning in 1952, the younger Kennedy entered the Presidential election in 1960, and won it. [ Claims of Anti-Semitism ] { Charles Lindbergh was an antiwar spokesman for the } { America First Committee. } Joseph P. Kennedy was (for a while) a close friend with the leading Jewish lawyer, Felix Frankfurter, who became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in January 1939 and remained in this position until 1962. Frankfurter helped Kennedy get his sons Joseph Jr. and John admitted into the London School of Economics in the late 1930s, where they studied under Harold Laski, a leading Jewish intellectual and a prominent socialist. { Leamer 66, 72; Renehan 5. } According to Harvey Klemmer, who served as one of Kennedy&apos;s embassy aides, Kennedy habitually referred to Jews as &quot; kike s or sheenies &quot;. Kennedy allegedly told Klemmer that &quot; [some] individual Jews are all right, Harvey, but as a race they stink. They sp oil everything they touch. &quot; When Klemmer returned from a trip to Germany and reported the pattern of vandalism and assaults on Jews by Nazis, Kennedy responded, &quot; Well, they brought it on themselves. &quot; { Leamer 115. } On June 13, 1938, Kennedy met with Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to the United Kingdom, in London, who claimed upon his return to Berlin that Kennedy had told him that &quot; it was not so much the fact that we want to get rid of the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamor with which we accompanied this purpose. [Kennedy] himself fully understood our Jewish policy. &quot; { Hersh 64; Renehan 29. } Kennedy&apos;s main concern with such violent acts against German Jews as Kristallnacht was that they generated bad publicity in the West for the Nazi regime, a concern that he communicated in a letter to Charles Lindbergh. { Renehan 60. } Kennedy had a close friendship with Nancy Astor. The correspondence between them is reportedly replete with anti-Semitic statements. { Renehan 26–27; Leamer 136. } As Edward Renehan notes: [ As fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and Astor looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these &quot; world problems &quot; (Nancy&apos;s phrase).... Kennedy replied that he expected the &quot; Jew media &quot; in the United States to become a problem, that &quot; Jewish pundits in New York and Los Angeles &quot; were already making noises contrived to &quot; set a match to the fuse of the world &quot;. Renehan, &quot; Joseph Kennedy and the Jews &quot;. ] By August 1940, Kennedy worried that a third term as the President for Roosevelt would mean war. As Leamer reports, &quot; Joe believed that Roosevelt, Churchill, the Jews, and their allies would manipulate America into approaching Armageddon. &quot; { Leamer 134. } Nevertheless, Kennedy supported Roosevelt&apos;s third term in return for Roosevelt&apos;s support of Joseph Kennedy, Jr., in the run for the Governor of Massachusetts in 1942. { Fleming, Thomas The New Dealers&apos; War: F.D.R. And The War Within World War II, Basic Books, 2001. } However, even during the darkest months of World War II, Kennedy remained &quot; more wary of &quot; prominent American Jews, such as Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, than he was of Hitler. { Renehan 311. } Kennedy told the reporter Joe Dinneen: [ It is true that I have a low opinion of some Jews in public office and in private life. That does not mean that I... believe they should be wiped off the face of the Earth... Jews who take an unfair advantage of the fact that theirs is a persecuted race do not help much... Publicizing unjust attacks upon the Jews may help to cure the injustice, but continually publicizing the whole problem only serves to keep it alive in the public mind. ] [ Political alliances ] Kennedy used his wealth and connections to build a national network of supporters that became the base for his sons&apos; political careers. He especially concentrated on the Irish American community in large cities, particularly Boston, New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and several New Jersey cities. { Leamer pp 313, 434; Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor. American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley -- His Battle for Chicago and the Nation (2001) p. 250; Timothy J. Meagher. The Columbia Guide to Irish American History (2005) p.150. } Kennedy also used Arthur Krock of The New York Times, America&apos;s most influential political columnist, for decades as a paid speechwriter and political advisor. { Leamer p. 349 } [ Alliance with Senator McCarthy ] Kennedy&apos;s close ties with Republican (GOP) Senator Joseph McCarthy strengthened his family&apos;s position among Irish Catholics, but weakened it among liberals who strongly opposed McCarthy. Even before McCarthy became famous in 1950, Kennedy had forged close ties with the Republican Senator from Wisconsin. Kennedy often brought him to his family compound at Hyannis Port as a weekend house guest in the late 1940s. McCarthy at one point dated Patricia Kennedy. When McCarthy became a dominant voice of anti-Communism starting in 1950, Kennedy contributed thousands of dollars to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. In the Senate race of 1952, Kennedy apparently worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches for the GOP ticket in Massachusetts. In return, Congressman John F. Kennedy, running for the Senate seat, would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters wanted to hear. In 1953 at Kennedy&apos;s urging McCarthy hired Robert Kennedy (age 27) as a senior staff member of the Senate&apos;s investigations subcommittee, which McCarthy chaired. In 1954, when the Senate was threatening to condemn McCarthy, Senator John Kennedy faced a dilemma. &quot; How could I demand that Joe McCarthy be censured for things he did when my own brother was on his staff? &quot; asked JFK. By 1954, however, Robert Kennedy and McCarthy&apos;s chief aide, Roy Cohn, had had a falling out and Robert no longer worked for McCarthy. John Kennedy had a speech drafted calling for the censure of McCarthy but he never delivered it. When the Senate voted to censure McCarthy on December 2, 1954, Senator Kennedy was in the hospital and never indicated then or later how he would vote. Joe Kennedy strongly supported McCarthy to the end. { Michael O&apos;Brien, John F. Kennedy: A Biography (2005), 250–54, 274–79, 396–400; Thomas C. Reeves, The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy (1982), 442–3; Maier, The Kennedys 270–80. } [ Presidential ambitions for family ] [ February 2011 ] { Joe Kennedy was a fiercely ambitious individual who thrived on competition and winning. And, in his eyes, the ultimate prize was the American presidency. Joe Kennedy wanted his first son, Joe Jr. to become president, but after his death in WWII, he became determined to make his eldest surviving son, John, president. } Joe Kennedy was consigned to the political shadows after his remarks during World War II that &quot; Democracy is finished... &quot;, and he remained an intensely controversial figure among U.S. citizens because of his suspect business credentials, his Roman Catholicism, his opposition to Roosevelt&apos;s foreign policy, and his support for Joseph McCarthy. As a result, his presence in John F. Kennedy&apos;s presidential campaign had to be downplayed. Having him in the spotlight would hurt John, making it look as if it were his father who was running for president. However, Joe Kennedy still drove the campaign behind the scenes. He played a central role in planning strategy, fundraising, and building coalitions and alliances. Joe supervised the spending and to some degree the overall campaign strategy, helped select advertising agencies, and was endlessly on the phone with local and state party leaders, newsmen, and business leaders. He had met thousands of powerful people in his career, and often called in his chips to help his sons. His father&apos;s connections and influence were turned directly into political capital for the senatorial and presidential campaigns of John, Robert and Ted. Historian Richard J. Whalen describes Joe&apos;s influence on John Kennedy&apos;s policy decisions in his biography of Joseph Kennedy. Joe was influential in creating the Kennedy Cabinet (Robert Kennedy as Attorney General although he&apos;d never argued or tried a case, for example { Kessler, p. 389. } ). However, in 1961, Joe Kennedy suffered from a stroke that placed even more limitations on his influence in his sons&apos; political careers. Joseph Kennedy expanded the Kennedy Compound, which continues as a major center of family get-togethers. When John F. Kennedy was asked about the level of involvement and influence that his father had held in his razor-thin presidential victory, JFK would joke that on the eve before the election, his father had asked him the exact number of votes he would need to win—there was no way he was paying &quot; for a landslide &quot;. John&apos;s presidency was a victory for Joe. He saw it as a step forward not just for his son but for the entire Kennedy family. Joe was a family man and strategically constructed his family&apos;s image towards the public. He once said, &quot; Image is reality &quot;, and the presidency framed the Kennedy family picture. { Whalen pp. 435–82 } { Whalen } [ Illness and death ] Joseph and family celebrate his birthday in Hyannis Port in 1963 after his stroke. On December 19, 1961, at the age of 73, Kennedy suffered a major stroke. He survived, but lost all power of speech, and was left paralyzed on his right side. Kennedy did regain certain functions with the help of therapies. Most notably, he went to The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential in 1964, a Philadelphia center that teaches therapies for people with brain injuries. Kennedy made gains with therapy, and began walking with the help of a cane. His speech also showed some improvement. { &quot; People: May 22, 1964 &quot;, Time, May 22, 1964. } However, being 75 years old and greatly weakened, Kennedy was soon confined to a wheelchair. Despite being severely disabled from the stroke, Kennedy remained aware of the tragedies that befell his family during that time until his own death, on November 18, 1969, two months after his 81st birthday. [ October 2010 ] His final public appearance was with Rose and Sen. Edward Kennedy in a videotaped message to the country a few weeks after the death of Robert Kennedy, which showed his extremely frail physical condition. His widow Rose outlived him by 25 years, dying in January 1995 at the age of 104. [ In fiction ] In the alternate history novel Fatherland by Robert Harris, set in 1964, Joseph P. Kennedy—not his son John F. Kennedy—is president of the United States and about to arrive in Berlin to conclude a treaty with Adolf Hitler. Joseph Kennedy also plays a significant role as a character in Michael Dobbs &apos;s fictionalized account of the rise of Winston Churchill, Winston&apos;s War. [ Movies and Television ] Kennedy has been portrayed by: Stephen Elliott in the 1977 movie Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy, E.G. Marshall in the 1983 miniseries Kennedy, Lloyd Nolan in the 1985 film Prince Jack Barry Morse in the 1987 miniseries Hoover vs. The Kennedys William Petersen in the 1990 miniseries The Kennedys of Massachusetts, Terry Kinney in the 1993 TV miniseries JFK: Reckless Youth, Irish actor Dan O&apos;Herlihy in the 1998 movie The Rat Pack, Tom Skerritt in the 2000 TV movie Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, Tom Wilkinson in the 2011 miniseries The Kennedys.
