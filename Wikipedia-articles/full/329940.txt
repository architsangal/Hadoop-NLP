The school&apos;s main block, built in 1916 in the &quot; Spanish Mission &quot; style, is used for daily assemblies, exhibitions, and contains various classrooms. [ September 2010 ] Surrounding the main hall in which the daily assembly is held are the school honours boards listing the names of the school&apos;s top scholars including Rhodes Scholars and Girdlers Scholars. The school owns a facility called the VentureLodge located in the township of Ohakune, in the central North Island, which is used by students for camps. { Venture Lodge | Auckland Grammar School.

In addition to its original or &quot; main &quot; building Auckland Grammar School has in recent years added several new structures. These include a new gymnasium which contains several full size basketball courts. Most recently a sports pavilion was completed on its upper field to house events and sports teams. { About Grammar | Auckland Grammar School. Ags.school.nz. Retrieved on 2011-08-10. } [ Enrolment ] Historically, because of its reputation, the demand for places in the school has outstripped capacity, and entry was selective. The school was zoned at least since the 1960s. Now entry is determined by a state school enrolment scheme. The school argues that zoning increases house prices in the zone, reducing access to the school for students from lower socio-economic groups. { Enrolment | Auckland Grammar School. Ags.school.nz (2010-09-06).

International students are tested for English language proficiency and some students may be required to complete an intensive course of English language before starting at Auckland Grammar School.

In response to what is perceived by the school to be a poorly designed system being forced on them, the school introduced Cambridge International Examinations in 2002, offering the IGCSE, AS  Level and A2  examinations to its more talented students. Other students sit NCEA  exams. Students placed in an IGCSE/AS/A2 class are allowed to switch to NCEA, but this is usually discouraged by the school. However in the ensuing years the majority of students were encouraged to take part in CIE  qualifications.The introduction of New Zealand Scholarship has been viewed skeptically by the school, and it encourages only the top students to attempt it. Despite this, the school had the highest number of scholarships of any school in New Zealand in 2006.
