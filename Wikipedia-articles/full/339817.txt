(retrieved 17 July 2010) } [ History ] Wichita is a member of the Caddoan language family, along with modern Caddo, Pawnee, Arikara, and Kitsai. When the Europeans began to settle North America, Wichita separated into three dialects; Waco, Towakoni, and Kirikir [ Ɂ ] i:s (aka, Wichita Proper). However, when the language was threatened and the number of speakers decreased, dialect differences largely disappeared { Taylor, 1967, p.113-131 } While at present there is one living native speaker, as late as 2007 there were three living native speakers. { Rood, 1975, p. 315-337 } This is a sharp decline from the 500 speakers estimated by Paul L. Garvin in 1950. { Garvin, 1950, p. 179-184 } [ Phonology ] The phonology of Wichita is unusual, with almost no labials (the two exceptions being /kw/ and /w/. There is only one nasal (depending on conflicting theory one or more nasal sounds may appear, but all theories seem to agree that they are allophones of the same phoneme, at best), and possibly a three vowel system using only height for contrast. [ Consonants ] Wichita has 10 consonant s. In the Americanist orthography generally used when describing Wichita, [ [ts] ] is spelled &lt; c &gt;, and [ [j] ] &lt; y &gt;. Alveolar Palatal Velar Glottal plain labial Plosive t k kʷ ʔ Affricate ts Fricative s Sonorant ɾ ~ n Approximant j w h Though neither Rood nor Garvin include nasals in their respective consonant charts for Wichita, Rood’s later inclusion of nasals in phonetic transcription for his 2008 paper (“Some Wichita Recollections: Aspects of Culture Reflected in Language”) support the appearance of at least /n/. [ /m/ ] [ [ɾ] ] [ [n] ] [ [n] ] [ /t, ts, s/ ] [ [nn] ] [ [ɾ] ] [ [n] ] [ [ɾ̥h] ] [ [nts], [nt], [ns], [nn], [ɾʔ], [ɾh] ] [ [ɾ̥], [w̥] ] Labial s are generally absent, occurring in only two roots: kammac to grind corn and camma:ci to hoe, to cultivate. Apart from the in these two verbs, Nasals are allophonic. The allophones and are in complementary distribution : It is before alveolars ( and in geminate ) and initially before a vowel, and elsewhere. Thus its initial consonant clusters are and, and its medial &amp; final clusters are. Final r and w are voiceless: Glottalized Final Consonants: One aspect of Wichita phonetics is the occurrence of glottalized final consonants. Taylor asserts that when a long vowel precedes a glottal stop (Ɂ), there is no change to the pronunciation. However, when the glottal stop is preceded by a short vowel, the vowel is eliminated. If the short vowel was preceded by a consonant, then the consonant is glottalized. Taylor hypothesizes that these glottalized final consonants show that the consonant was not originally a final consonant, that the proto form (an earlier language from which Wichita split off, that Taylor was aiming to reconstruct in his paper) ended in a glottal stop, and that a vowel has been lost between the consonant and glottal stop. [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] Original Word Ending Change Result Wichita Example [V: #] No Change [V: #] [V #] [V:V #] [V: #] [hija* ](snow) - [CV #] [C #] [ki*s ](bone) V:- long vowelV- short vowelC- consonant - preceding sound ends word Taylor also finds that previous phonetic translations have recorded the phoneme /ts/ (aka /c/), as occurring after /i/, while /s/ is recorded when preceded by /a/. In Wichita the sounds /kw/ and /w/ are not differentiated when they begin a word, and word-initial /p/ is expressed as /w/. This is unusual, in that while the majority of Caddoan languages pronounce words that used to begin with /w/ as /p/. These three sounds were also merged when preceded by a consonant. Wichita shifted consonant initial /p/ to /kw/ with other medial occurrences of /p/. /kw/ and /w/ remain distinct following a vowel. For example, the word for ‘man’ is /wi˖c/ in Wichita, but /pi˖ta/ in South Band Pawnee, and /pita/ in Skiri Pawnee. [ Vowels ] Wichita has either three or four vowels, depending on interpretation : Front Back High ɪ ~ i ~ e Mid ɛ ~ æ (o/u) Low ɒ ~ a These are transcribed as i, e, a, o/u. Word-final vowels are devoiced. Though Rood employs the vowel /o/ in his transcriptions, Garvin instead uses /u/, and asserts that /u/ is its own phoneme. However, considering the imprecision in vowel sound articulation, what is likely important about these transcriptions is that they signify a back vowel that is not low [+back, -low]. Taylor uses Garvin’s transcription in his analysis, but theorizes a shift of /u/ to /i/ in Wichita medially, but does not have enough examples to fully analyze all the possible envronments. He also discusses a potential shift from /a/ to /i/, but again, does not have enough examples to develop a definitive hypothesis. Taylor finds only /ɛ/ occurs with intervocalic glottal stops. Rood argues that [ [o] ] is not phonemic, as it is often equivalent to any vowel + [ /w/ ] + any vowel. For example, [ [awa] ] is frequently contracted to [ [óː] ] (the high tone is an effect of the elided consonant). There are relatively few cases where speakers will not accept a substitution of vowel + [ /w/ ] + vowel for [o]; one of them is [ [kóːs] ] &apos;eagle&apos;. Rood also proposes that, with three vowels that are arguably high, mid, and low, the front-back distinction is not phonemic, and that one may therefore speak of a &apos; vertical &apos; vowel inventory (see below). This also has been claimed for relatively few languages, such as the Northwest Caucasian languages and the Ndu languages of Papua New Guinea. There is clearly at least a two-way contrast in vowel length. Rood proposes that there is a three-way contrast, which is quite rare among the world&apos;s languages, although well attested for Mixe, and probably present in Estonian. However, in Wichita, for each of the three to four vowels qualities, one of the three lengths is rare, and in addition the extra-long vowels frequently involve either an extra morpheme, or suggest that prosody may be at work. For example, [ nɪːts.híːːʔɪh ] [ nɪːːts.híːːʔɪh ] &apos;the strong one&apos; &apos;the strong ones&apos; [ hɛːhɪɾʔíːɾas ] [ hɛːːhɪɾʔíːɾas ] &apos;let him find you&apos; &apos;let him find it for you&apos; [ háɾah ] [ háːɾɪh ] [ háːːɾɪh ] &apos;there&apos; &apos;here it is&apos; (said when handing something over) &apos;that one&apos; (Note that it is common in many languages to use prosodic lengthening with demonstratives such as &apos;there&apos; or &apos;that&apos;.) This contrasts with Mixe, where it is easy to find a three-way length contrast without the addition of morphemes. Under Rood&apos;s analysis, then, Wichita has 9 phonemic vowels: : Short Long Overlong High ɪ ɪˑ ɪː Mid ɛ ɛˑ ɛː Low a aˑ aː [ Tone ] There is also a contrastive high tone, indicated here by an acute accent. [ Consonants ] The perfective tense demonstrates that an act has been completed; on the other hand, the intentive tense indicates that a subject plans or planned to carry out a certain act. The habitual act indicates a habitual activity, for example “he smokes, and “not” he is smoking.” Durative tense describes an activity, which is “coextensive with something else.” ” [ Syllable and phonotactics ] While vowel clusters are uncommon (unless the extra-long vowels are clusters), consonant cluster s are ubiquitous in Wichita. Words may begin with clusters such as [ [kskh] ] ( [ kskhaːɾʔa ] ) and [ [ɾ̥h] ] ( [ ɾ̥hintsʔa ] ). The longest cluster noted in Wichita is five consonants long, counting [ [ts] ] as a single consonant [ /c/ ] : [ /nahiʔinckskih/ ] &apos;while sleeping&apos;. However, Wichita syllable s are more commonly CV or CVC. [ Grammar and morphology ] Wichita is an agglutinative, polysynthetic language; meaning words have a root verb basis to which information is added, i.e., morphemes (affixes) are added to verb roots. These words may contain subjects, objects, indirect objects, and possibly indicate possession. Thus, surprisingly complex ideas can be communicated with as little as one word: For example, /kiyaʔa:csthirʔa:c/ means ‘one makes himself a fire’. Nouns do not distinguish between singular and plural, as this information is specified as part of the verb. Wichita also does not distinguish between gender, which can be problematic for English language translation. Sentence structure is much more fluid than English, with words are organized according to importance or novelty. Often the subject of the sentence is placed initially. Linguist David S. Rood, who has written many papers concerning the Wichita language, recorded this example, as spoken by Bertha Provost (a native speaker, now deceased) in the late 60s:. [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] [ Ɂ ] &apos;&apos;&apos; &lt; small &gt; Translation: When God put our ancestors on this earth. Wichita hira:wis iha:s kiyari:ce:hire:we e hika aca:kika ak icaki hira:r ti i na:kirih Word Translation Old.time.people God When.he.made.us.dwell Earth This Where.it.is.located The subject of the sentence is ancestors, and thus the sentence begins with it, instead of God, or creation (when.he.made.us.dwell). This leads one to conclude Wichita has a largely free word-order, where parts of the sentence do not need to be located next to each other to be related. Wichita has no indirect speech or passive voice. When using past tense, speakers must indicate if this knowledge of the past is based in hearsay or personal knowledge. Wichita speakers also use a morpheme which amounts to two versions of “we”; one that includes the listener, and one that does not. Wichita also differentiates between singular, dual and plural, instead of the simpler singular or plural designations commonly found. [ Revitalization efforts ] The Wichita and Affiliated Tribes offers language classes, taught by Doris McLemore and Shirley Davilla. The tribe has created an immersion class for children and a class for adults. Linguist David Rood has collaborated with Wichita speakers to create a dictionary and language CDs. { Ruckman, S. E. &quot; Tribal language fading away. &quot; Tulsa World. 26 Nov 2007 (retrieved 3 Oct 2009) } The tribe is collaborating with Rood of the University of Colorado, Boulder to document and teach the language through the Wichita Documentation Project.
