[ May 2012 ] [ spontaneous combustion ] Spontaneous human combustion (SHC) describes reported cases of the burning of a living human body without an apparent external source of ignition. There have been about 200 cited cases { &quot; Ablaze!: The Mysterious Fires of Spontaneous Human Combustion &quot; Arnold, Larry E. 1995 ISBN 0-87131-789-3 } worldwide over a period of around 300 years. There are also many hypotheses which attempt to explain the various cases of human spontaneous combustion : Paranormal explanations (e.g., a ghost or divine intervention) Natural explanations based on an unknown and otherwise unobserved phenomenon (e.g., production of abnormally concentrated gas or raised levels of blood alcohol cause spontaneous ignition) Natural explanations that involve an external source of ignition (e.g., the victim dropped a cigarette) Objections to natural explanations typically refer to the degree of burning of the body with respect to its surroundings. Indeed, one of the common markers of a case of SHC is that the body – or part of it – suffered an extraordinarily large degree of burning, with surroundings or lower limbs comparatively undamaged. Although there is no current scientific evidence to support it, supernatural explanations of spontaneous human combustion remain popular. [ Characteristics ] The spontaneous combustion of people (i.e. death from a fire originating within the victim&apos;s body without a direct external cause) is a theorised explanation for a number of unexplained cases, some of which are well-documented and many of which are not. The more convincing cases share the following characteristics: [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15032614 BBC News &apos;First Irish case&apos; of death by spontaneous combustion 23 September 2011 ] The body is completely or almost completely incinerated, while nearby furniture that should normally have been damaged under such temperatures remains intact. Damage is limited to the victim&apos;s clothing, to the area of the floor or furniture on which he or she died, and to the ceiling above the corpse. The torso is the focus of the fire, and if remains are found these are of the extremities, such as the feet. There are no traces of fire accelerant, and the fire does not have an evident external cause. The victim is typically alone at the time of death, and is thought to have been alive when the fire started, despite showing little sign of having struggled. [ Suggested explanations ] Many hypotheses attempt to explain how SHC might occur but according to those that rely on current scientific understanding, incidents that might appear as spontaneous combustion actually had an external source of ignition – and the likelihood of true spontaneous human combustion is quite low.

There are 5 billion people in the world, and yet we don&apos;t see reports of people bursting into flame while walking down the street, attending football games, or sipping a coffee at a local Starbucks. &quot; [ http://bodyodd.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/09/26/7976119-irishman-died-of-spontaneous-human-combustion-coroner-claims Irishman died of spontaneous human combustion, coroner claims MSNBC 26 September 2011 8 October 2011 ] Paranormal researcher Brian Dunning states that SHC stories &quot; are simply the rare cases where a natural death in isolation has been followed by a slow combustion from some nearby source of ignition. &quot; Other stories of people suddenly aflame should be called &quot; Unsolved deaths by fire &quot;; just because the cause was not discovered does not mean SHC occurs.

Victims show a high likelihood of dying in their sleep, or of being unable to move once they had caught fire. Cigarettes are often seen as the source of fire, as dropped cigarettes are the leading cause of house fires in the USA. Natural causes such as heart attacks may lead to the victim dying, subsequently dropping the cigarette, which after a period of smouldering can ignite the victim&apos;s clothes. The &quot; wick effect &quot; hypothesis suggests that a small external flame source, such as a burning cigarette, chars the clothing of the victim at a location, splitting the skin and releasing subcutaneous fat, which is in turn absorbed into the burned clothing, acting as a wick. This combustion can continue for as long as the fuel is available. This hypothesis has been successfully tested with animal tissue (pig) and is consistent with evidence recovered from cases of human combustion. The human body typically has enough stored energy in fat and other chemical stores to fully combust the body; even lean people have several pounds of fat in their tissues. This fat, once heated by the burning clothing, wicks into the clothing much as candle wax (which was originally made of animal fat) wicks into a lit candle wick to provide the fuel needed to keep the wick burning. [ Not-so-spontaneous human combustion Skeptical Inquirer Nov–December 1996 Joe Nickell http://www.csicop.org/si/show/not-so-spontaneous_human_combustion/ 16 August 2010 ] Scalding can cause burn-like injuries, including death, without setting fire to clothing. Although not applicable in cases where the body is charred and burnt, this has been suggested as a cause in at least one claimed SHC-like event. [ Unverified natural phenomena ] Another hypothesis suggests high-energy particles or gamma rays coupled with susceptibilities in the potential victim (e.g., increased alcohol in the blood) triggers the initial reaction. This process may use no external oxygen to spread throughout the body, since it may not be an oxidation-reduction reaction. However, no reaction mechanism has been proposed, nor has a source for the high-energy particles.

Mott (United States, 1986) Michael Faherty (Ireland, 2010) Elizabeth McLaughlin (Ireland, 2010) [ In fiction ] Examples of spontaneous human combustion are somewhat common in fictional works from the 19th century onwards. It is used both as a central plot device and as an incidental occurrence. The second and third chapters of Charles Brockden Brown &apos;s 1798 novel &apos;&apos;Wieland&apos;&apos; focus on the emigration of Wieland, a German, to colonial America. As part of his religious practices, he spends solitary hours in a temple constructed on his property. One night his family hears &quot; a loud report, like the explosion of a mine. &quot; Rushing to the temple, they find Wieland lying with his clothing burned off and delirious. He dies soon after. While the term &quot; spontaneous human combustion &quot; was not yet created, Brown includes a footnote at the end of chapter 2 that suggests the phenomenon and its existence in 18th century medical studies. The footnote reads: &quot; A case, in its symptoms exactly parallel to this, is published in one of the Journals of Florence. See, likewise, similar cases reported by Messrs. Merille and Muraire, in the Journal de Medicine, for February and May, 1783. The researches of Maffei and Fontana have thrown light upon this subject. &quot; Russian author Nikolai Gogol includes SHC in three works, including his novel Dead Souls. { Lee B Croft. &quot; People in Threes Going Up In Smoke and Other Triplicities in Russian Literature and Culture &quot; The Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature, Vol. 59, No. 2 (2005), pp. l 29–49 } Charles Dickens provides a very graphical depiction of the death of the shopkeeper Mr. Krook by spontaneous combustion in his novel Bleak House (1852). At the time, many readers considered spontaneous combustion highly dubious if not impossible, but Dickens nonetheless staunchly defended the plausibility of his account. Considering his prominence, Dickens&apos; portrayal likely renewed public interest and belief in the phenomenon. [ Does Spontaneous Human Combustion Exist? BBC News 21 November 2005 11 March 2011 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4456428.stm ] Jules Verne describes in his novel Dick Sand, A Captain at Fifteen (1878) that when a fictional African &quot; King of Kazounde &quot; tasted a punch set aflame, &quot; An act of spontaneous combustion had just taken place. The king had taken fire like a petroleum bonbon. This fire developed little heat, but it devoured nonetheless. &quot; Verne had no doubt about SHC being the result of alcoholism: &quot; In bodies so thoroughly alcoholized, combustion only produces a light and bluish flame, that water cannot extinguish. Even stifled outside, it would still continue to burn inwardly. When liquor has penetrated all the tissues, there exists no means of arresting the combustion. &quot; [ Verne Jules Dick Sand a Captain at Fifteen Kessinger Publishing, LLC 17 June 2004 http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dpk-9Oj2Q6t0C 279 ISBN 978-1-4191-1605-6 24 September 2011 ] In the second episode of Season II of the drama &quot; Picket Fences &quot;, Town Mayor Bill Pugen (Michael Keenan) becomes of victim of Spontaneous Human Combustion. In Michael Scott &apos;s novels, The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, spontaneous human combustion is described as being caused by one using up all of one&apos;s aura (magical energy).
