[ History ] Devil&apos;s Lake was a Powtawatamie village until about 1830. { Helen Hornbeck Tanner. Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1987) p. 134. } Manitou Beach, first noted by Euro-American settlers in the early 1830s, quickly became a favored resort in southeast Michigan by the turn of the 20th century. It quickly outgrew the comparably sized community of Devils Lake at the north end of the lake. Steam launches ferried tourists from the depot to the hotels and attractions, which included bath houses, a dance pavilion, pleasure craft rental facilities, a water slide, picnic areas and eating establishments. The name &apos;Manitou Beach&apos; is derived from the Potawatomi name of Devils Lake, &quot; Michemanetue &quot;, meaning, &quot; Lake of the (evil) Spirit &quot;. The Manitou Beach post office was established on March 20, 1889, with Columbus F. Becker as the first postmaster. The office was discontinued on December 31, 1892, and reestablished on January 17, 1893.

Meteau believed her to have been taken by evil spirits. The first white settlers here arrived in 1833. The Devils Lake post office was established on October 19, 1885, with John B. Allen as the first postmaster. The office was discontinued on October 31, 1936.

Most of what was destroyed was rebuilt, including the dance hall and two churches. Over the course of the past four decades, the resort has few reminders of the tornado. A book on the tornado was compiled from 2000 to 2002 by local author Dan Cherry, and published in the summer of 2004. Other books published on the lake resort include Lake Reflections by Margaret Brighton and the Lakes Preservation League (1996), Ho! For Devils Lake by Barbara Page Roys (1998), and Along the Trails of Michemanetue, released by Cherry in 2009. In 2010, the community of Manitou Beach continues to draw vacationers, and because of its popularity, one by one the small seasonal cottages are being replaced by large, year-around homes. The Devils Lake Drive-In-Church, a drive-in movie theater, closed its doors after 58 seasons due to the death of its operator. The Manitou Beach Inn, a long-time staple of the business community, was destroyed by fire January 3, 2010. { http://www.lenconnect.com/features/x370509933/Fire-destroys-Manitou-Beach-business } [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 9.7 square miles (25.2 km²), of which, 7.0 square miles (18.1  km²) of it is land and 2.7 square miles (7.1  km²) of it (28.13%) is water.
