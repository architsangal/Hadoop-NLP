The club has been host to many national and international celebrity guests such as Jazztronik, Gilles Peterson, Toshio Matsuura from UFO, DJs Ravi, Julien Love and Two Dee, and Soil and Pimp Sessions. He has also mixed music with Tyronne Noonan, former frontman of George. About twenty or so bronze statues - each perhaps four or five feet tall - of characters and scenes from the popular 1970s anime Uchū Senkan Yamato (Space Battleship Yamato or, in the United States, Star Blazers) and Galaxy Express 999 were erected in the city&apos;s downtown area in 1999. Though the creator of these shows, Leiji Matsumoto, was born elsewhere, an exhibit of his artwork was held in the city in 1999 as part of the city&apos;s 100th anniversary celebration, accompanied by the erection of the statues. [ Incendiary Attack during World War II ] During the final year of World War II the U.S. launched a ruthless firebombing campaign against sixty-seven Japanese cities, destroying 50% of key cities including Tokyo, up to 86% of many others, and flattening the city of Toyama, which was 99% destroyed. { The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara (2003). DVD. Directed by Errol Morris. New York: Sony Pictures Classics, 2003. } Tsuruga fell victim to one such attack on the night of July 12th 1945, along with three other cities (Utsunomiya, Ichinomiya, and Uwajima) and one precision target (the Kawasaki Petroleum Plant). Tsuruga’s status as a foremost “Korean shuttle ports” and lack of adequate fire breaks made it a prime target for attack. Tsuruga also housed numerous warehouses, a chemical plant, and vital railroad lines that the U.S. hoped to destroy in order to cripple Japan’s manufacturing capacity and economic production. The 313th Wing, equipped with M-47 incendiary bombs and 500 lb clusters including M-69 bombs, was dispatched to conduct the raid. Ninety-four B-29 bombers dropped 8,325 bombs weighing 695.1 tons on all targets. The raid effectively destroyed 0.77 square miles of built-up area, or 68% of the total built-up area of the city. Mission 265 was successfully completed without suffering any crew member casualties or aircraft damage, a testament to the superiority of American aircraft and the overall ineffectiveness of the Japanese anti-craft measures in place at the time. { Bitter, Francis, De Forest Van Slyck, Robert Stearns, Paul Kerschbaum, Edwin Martin, Roswell Whitman, and Charles Hitch.
