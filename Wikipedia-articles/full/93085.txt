Asteroid 187 Lamberta was named in his honour. [ Biography ] Lambert was born in 1728 in the city of Mulhouse (now in Alsace, France ), at that time an exclave of Switzerland. Leaving school he continued to study in his free time whilst undertaking a series of jobs. These included assistant to his father (a tailor), a clerk at a nearby iron works, a private tutor, secretary to the editor of Basler Zeitung and, at the age of 20, private tutor to the sons of Count Salis in Chur. Travelling Europe with his charges (1756–1758) allowed him to meet established mathematicians in the German states, The Netherlands, France and the Italian states. On his return to Chur he published his first books (on optics and cosmology) and began to seek an academic post. After a few short posts he was rewarded (1764) by an invitation from Euler to a position at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he gained the sponsorship of Frederick II of Prussia. In this stimulating, and financially stable, environment he worked prodigiously until his death in 1777. [ Work ] [ Mathematics ] Lambert was the first to introduce hyperbolic function s into trigonometry. Also, he made conjectures regarding non-Euclidean space. Lambert is credited with the first proof that π is irrational (although it is speculated that Aryabhata was the first to hint at that, in 500 CE [ S. Balachandra Rao Indian Mathematics and Astronomy: Some Landmarks Jnana Deep Publications 1994/1998 Bangalore 81-7371-205-0 ] ). [ Lambert Johann Heinrich Mémoire sur quelques propriétés remarquables des quantités transcendentes circulaires et logarithmiques 1768 1762 Histoire de l&apos;Académie Berlin XVII 265 –322 ] Lambert also devised theorems regarding conic section s that made the calculation of the orbit s of comet s simpler. Lambert devised a formula for the relationship between the angles and the area of hyperbolic triangle s. These are triangles drawn on a concave surface, as on a saddle, instead of the usual flat Euclidean surface. Lambert showed that the angles cannot add up to π ( radian s ), or 180°. The amount of shortfall, called defect, is proportional to the area. The larger the triangle&apos;s area, the smaller the sum of the angles and hence the larger the defect CΔ = π — (α + β + γ). That is, the area of a hyperbolic triangle (multiplied by a constant C) is equal to π (in radians), or 180°, minus the sum of the angles α, β, and γ. Here C denotes, in the present sense, the negative of the curvature of the surface (taking the negative is necessary as the curvature of a saddle surface is defined to be negative in the first place). As the triangle gets larger or smaller, the angles change in a way that forbids the existence of similar hyperbolic triangles, as only triangles that have the same angles will have the same area. Hence, instead of expressing the area of the triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides, as in Euclid&apos;s geometry, the area of Lambert&apos;s hyperbolic triangle can be expressed in terms of its angles. [ Map projection ] Lambert was the first mathematician to address the general properties of map projection s. In particular he was the first to discuss the properties of conformality and equal areapreservation and to point out that they were mutually exclusive. (Snyder 1993 [ Snyder, John P. Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections University of Chicago Press 1993 0-226-76747-7 ] {. } p77). In 1772 Lambert published { Lambert, Johann Heinrich. 1772.

Lambert did not give names to any of his projections but they are now known as: Lambert conformal conic Transverse Mercator Lambert azimuthal equal area Lagrange projection Lambert cylindrical equal area Transverse cylindrical equal area Lambert conical equal area The first three of these are of great importance. Further details may be found at map projections and in several texts. [ Snyder, John P. Map Projections - A Working Manual.

In 1760, he published a book on illumination, the Photometria, which was based on three assumptions, the illumination was proportional to the strength of the source, inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the illuminated surface and the sine of the angle of inclination of the light&apos;s direction to that of the surface. These assumptions were supported by experiments involving the visual comparison of illuminations and used for the calculation of illumination. In Photometria Lambert also formulated the law of light absorption—the Beer–Lambert law ) and introduced the term albedo. [ Mach Ernst The Principles of Physical Optics Dover 2003 0-486-49559-0 14–20 ] He wrote a classic work on perspective and contributed to geometrical optics. The photometric unit lambert is named in recognition of his work in establishing the study of photometry. [ Philosophy ] In his main philosophical work, New Organon (1764), Lambert studied the rules for distinguishing subjective from objective appearances. This connects with his work in the science of optics. In 1765 he began corresponding with Immanuel Kant who intended to dedicate him the Critique of Pure Reason but the work was delayed, appearing after his death { O&apos;Leary M., Revolutions of Geometry, London:Wiley, 2010, p.385 }. [ Astronomy ] Lambert also developed a theory of the generation of the universe that was similar to the nebular hypothesis that Thomas Wright and Immanuel Kant had (independently) developed. Wright published his account in An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe (1750), Kant in Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels, published anonymously in 1755. Shortly afterward, Lambert published his own version of the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the solar system in Cosmologische Briefe über die Einrichtung des Weltbaues (1761). Lambert hypothesized that the stars near the sun were part of a group which travelled together through the Milky Way, and that there were many such groupings ( star system s ) throughout the galaxy. The former was later confirmed by Sir William Herschel. [ Logic ] Johann-Heinrich Lambert is the author of a treatise on logic, which he called Neues Organon, that is to say, the New Organon. The most recent edition of this work named after Aristotle&apos;s Organon was issued in 1990 by the Akademie-Verlag of Berlin. To say nothing of the fact that in it one has the first appearance of the term phenomenology, one can find therein a very pedagogical presentation of the various kinds of syllogism. In A System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive, John-Stuart Mill expresses his admiration for Johann Heinrich Lambert.
