The swell from the waves appears as fog. } In photography, exposure is the total amount of light allowed to fall on the photographic medium ( photographic film or image sensor ) during the process of taking a photograph. Exposure is measured in lux second s, and can be computed from exposure value (EV) and scene luminance over a specified area. In photographic jargon, an exposure generally refers to a single shutter cycle. For example: a long exposure refers to a single, protracted shutter cycle to capture enough low-intensity light, whereas a multiple exposure involves a series of relatively brief shutter cycles; effectively layering a series of photographs in one image. For the same film speed, the accumulated photometric exposure (H v ) should be similar in both cases. [ Photometric and radiometric exposure ] Photometric or luminous exposure { National Institute of Standards and Technology. Retrieved Feb 2009. } H v is the accumulated physical quantity of visible light energy (weighted by the luminosity function ) applied to a surface during a given exposure time.

Many photographic materials are also sensitive to &quot; invisible &quot; light, which can be a nuisance (see UV filter and IR filter ), or a benefit (see infrared photography and full-spectrum photography ). The use of radiometric units is appropriate to characterize such sensitivity to invisible light. In sensitometric data, such as characteristic curves, the log exposure is conventionally expressed as log 10 (H). Photographers more familiar with base-2 logarithmic scales (such as exposure value s ) can convert using [ log 2 (H) ≈ 3.32 log 10 (H) ]. [ 1 self nb ] [ 2 self nb ] [ Optimum exposure ] [ sensitometry ] &quot; Correct &quot; exposure may be defined as an exposure that achieves the effect the photographer intended. { Peterson, Bryan, &quot; Understanding Exposure &quot;, 2004, ISBN 0-8174-6300-3 : p.14 } A more technical approach recognises that a photographic film (or sensor) has a physically limited useful exposure range, { Ray, S.F. et al. 2000 &quot; The Manual of Photography &quot; Focal Press, ISBN 0-240-51574-9, p.230 } sometimes called its dynamic range. { Ray, S.F. et al. 2000 &quot; The Manual of Photography &quot; Focal Press, ISBN 0-240-51574-9, p.121 and p.245 } If, for any part of the photograph, the actual exposure is outside this range, the film cannot record it accurately. In a very simple model, for example, out-of-range values would be recorded as &quot; black &quot; (underexposed) or &quot; white &quot; (overexposed) rather than the precisely graduated shades of colour and tone required to describe &quot; detail &quot;. Therefore, the purpose of exposure adjustment (and/or lighting adjustment) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film, so that &apos;significant&apos; areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film&apos;s useful exposure range. This ensures that no &apos;significant&apos; information is lost during capture. It is worth noting that the photographer may carefully overexpose or underexpose the photograph to eliminate &apos;insignificant&apos; or &apos;unwanted&apos; detail; to make, for example, a white altar cloth appear immaculately clean, or to emulate the heavy, pitiless shadows of film noir. However, it is technically much easier to discard recorded information during post processing than to try to &apos;re-create&apos; unrecorded information. In a scene with strong or harsh lighting, the ratio between highlight and shadow luminance values may well be larger than the ratio between the film&apos;s maximum and minimum useful exposure values. In this case, adjusting the camera&apos;s exposure settings (which only applies changes to the whole image, not selectively to parts of the image) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights; it cannot bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time. Methods for dealing with this situation include: using some kind of fill light ing to gently increase the illumination in shadow areas; using a graduated ND filter or gobo to reduce the amount of light coming from the highlight areas; or varying the exposure between multiple, otherwise identical, photographs ( exposure bracketing ) and then combining them afterwards in some kind of HDRI process.

Intentionally over- or under- exposing (relative to a standard or the camera&apos;s automatic exposure) is casually referred to as &quot; shooting to the right &quot; or &quot; shooting to the left &quot;, respectively, as these shift the histogram of the image to the right or left. [ Exposure settings ] [ Manual exposure ] In manual mode, the photographer adjusts the lens aperture and/or shutter speed to achieve the desired exposure. Many photographers choose to control aperture and shutter independently because opening up the aperture increases exposure, but also decreases the depth of field, and a slower shutter increases exposure but also increases the opportunity for motion blur. &apos;Manual&apos; exposure calculations may be based on some method of light meter ing with a working knowledge of exposure value s, the APEX system and/or the Zone System. [ Automatic exposure ] A camera in automatic exposure ( abbreviation : AE) mode automatically calculates and adjusts exposure settings to match (as closely as possible) the subject&apos;s mid-tone to the mid-tone of the photograph. For most cameras this means using an on-board TTL exposure meter. Aperture priority mode ( commonly abbreviated to Av ) gives the photographer manual control of the aperture, whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the TTL meter. Shutter priority mode ( commonly abbreviated to Tv ) gives manual shutter control, with automatic aperture compensation. In each case, the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera&apos;s exposure meter. [ Exposure compensation ] [ exposure compensation ] The purpose of an exposure meter is to estimate the subject&apos;s mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it has to make a number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an exposure meter is taken as the &quot; reference &quot; exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies. Cameras with any kind of internal exposure meter usually feature an exposure compensation setting which is intended to allow the photographer to simply offset the exposure level from the internal meter&apos;s estimate of appropriate exposure.

On low-end video camcorders, exposure compensation may be the only manual exposure control available. [ Exposure control ] { Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew } { Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew } An appropriate exposure for a photograph is determined by the sensitivity of the medium used. For photographic film, sensitivity is referred to as film speed and is measured on a scale published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Faster film, that is, film with a higher ISO rating, requires less exposure to make a good image. Digital camera s usually have variable ISO settings that provide additional flexibility. Exposure is a combination of the length of time and the illuminance at the photosensitive material. Exposure time is controlled in a camera by shutter speed and the illuminance by the lens aperture and the scene luminance. Slower shutter speeds (exposing the medium for a longer period of time), and greater lens apertures (admitting more light), and higher-luminance scenes produce greater exposures. An approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day using ISO 100 film, an aperture of [ 16 yes ] and a shutter speed of 1/100 of a second. This is called the sunny 16 rule : at an aperture of 16 on a sunny day, a suitable shutter speed will be one over the film speed (or closest equivalent). A scene can be exposed in many ways, depending on the desired effect a photographer wishes to convey. [ Reciprocity ] [ reciprocity (photography) ] [ aperture exposure range f-number ] An important principle of exposure is reciprocity. If one exposes the film or sensor for a longer period, a reciprocally smaller aperture is required to reduce the amount of light hitting the film to obtain the same exposure. For example, the photographer may prefer to make his sunny-16 shot at an aperture of [ 5.6 ] (to obtain a shallow depth of field). As [ 5.6 ] is 3 stops &quot; faster &quot; than [ 16 ], with each stop meaning double the amount of light, a new shutter speed of (1/125)/(2·2·2) = 1/1000 is needed. Once the photographer has determined the exposure, aperture stops can be traded for halvings or doublings of speed, within limits. A demonstration of the effect of exposure in night photography. Longer shutter speeds result in increased exposure. The true characteristic of most photographic emulsions is not actually linear, (see sensitometry ) but it is close enough over the exposure range of about one second to 1/1000 of a second. Outside of this range, it becomes necessary to increase the exposure from the calculated value to account for this characteristic of the emulsion. This characteristic is known as reciprocity failure. The film manufacturer&apos;s data sheets should be consulted to arrive at the correction required as different emulsions have different characteristics. Digital camera image sensor s can also be subject to a form of reciprocity failure.

Busch Thomson Course Technology 1-59200-114-9 2003 ] [ Determining exposure ] A fair ride taken with a 2/5 second exposure. The Zone System is another method of determining exposure and development combinations to achieve a greater tonality range over conventional methods by varying the contrast of the &apos;film&apos; to fit the print contrast capability. Digital cameras can achieve similar results ( high dynamic range ) by combining several different exposures (varying only the shutter speeds) made in quick succession. Today, most cameras automatically determine the correct exposure at the time of taking a photograph by using a built-in light meter, or multiple point meters interpreted by a built-in computer, see metering mode. Negative/Print film tends to bias for exposing for the shadow areas (film dislikes being starved of light), with digital favouring exposure for highlights. See latitude below. [ Latitude ] Latitude is the degree by which one can over, or under expose an image, and still recover an acceptable level of quality from an exposure. Typically negative film has a better ability to record a range of brightness than slide/transparency film or digital. Digital should be considered to be the reverse of print film, with a good latitude in the shadow range, and a narrow one in the highlight area; in contrast to film&apos;s large highlight latitude, and narrow shadow latitude. Slide/Transparency film has a narrow latitude in both highlight and shadow areas, requiring greater exposure accuracy. Negative film&apos;s latitude increases somewhat with high ISO material, in contrast digital tends to narrow on latitude with high ISO settings. [ Highlights ] [ Clipping (photography) ] Example image exhibiting blown-out highlights. Top: original image, bottom: blown-out areas marked red Areas of a photo where information is lost due to extreme brightness are described as having &quot; blown-out highlights &quot; or &quot; flared highlights &quot;. In digital images this information loss is often irreversible, though small problems can be made less noticeable using photo manipulation software. Recording to RAW format can ameliorate this problem to some degree, as can using a digital camera with a better sensor. Film can often have areas of extreme overexposure but still record detail in those areas. This information is usually somewhat recoverable when printing or transferring to digital. A loss of highlights in a photograph is usually undesirable, but in some cases can be considered to &quot; enhance &quot; appeal. Examples include black-and-white photography and portraits with an out-of-focus background. [ Blacks ] Areas of a photo where information is lost due to extreme darkness are described as &quot; crushed blacks &quot;. Digital capture tends to be more tolerant of underexposure, allowing better recovery of shadow detail, than same-ISO negative print film. Crushed blacks cause loss of detail, but can be used for artistic effect.
