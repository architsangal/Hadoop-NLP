Howard the Duck Howard Marvel Comics Adventure into Fear #19 (Dec. 1973) Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik Defenders All-Night Party Daydreamers A.R.M.O.R. Fearsome Four Son of Satan Master of Quack-Fu, superhuman strength ] Howard the Duck is a comic book character in the Marvel Comics universe created by writer Steve Gerber and artist Val Mayerik. The character first appeared in Adventure into Fear #19 (Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered, anthropomorphic, &quot; funny animal &quot; trapped on human-dominated Earth. Howard&apos;s adventures are generally social satire s, while a few are parodies of genre fiction with a metafiction al awareness of the medium. The book is existentialist, and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: &quot; that life&apos;s most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view. &quot; This is diametrically opposed to screenwriter Gloria Katz, who in adapting the comic to the screen declared, &quot; It&apos;s a film about a duck from outer space... It&apos;s not supposed to be an existential experience &quot;. { http://www.comicsbulletin.com/foom/126874125950897.htm } [ Publication history ] { Adventure into Fear &apos;&apos; #19. Art by penciler } { Val Mayerik and inker } { Sal Trapani. } Howard the Duck was created in 1973 by Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik in Adventure into Fear as a secondary character in that comic&apos;s Man-Thing feature. He graduated to his own backup feature in Giant-Size Man-Thing, confronting such bizarre horror-parody characters as the Hellcow and the Man-Frog, before acquiring his own comic book title with Howard the Duck #1 in 1976. Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series (for the most part ditching the horror parodies), illustrated by a variety of artists, beginning with Frank Brunner. Brunner left the series because he considered Howard a cartoon in the real world, [ June 2010 ] whereas for Gerber, Howard was a flesh and blood duck. According to Gerber, &quot; if Wile E. Coyote gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote who can be expected to snap back to three dimensions within moments; if Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt. &quot; { Mediascene #25 issue date? page number? } Gene Colan eventually became the regular penciller. Sporting the slogan, &quot; Get Down, America! &quot;, the All-Night Party was a fictional political party that appeared in Gerber&apos;s Howard the Duck series during the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1976, and led to Howard the Duck receiving thousands of write-in votes in the actual election. { Smith, Zack. &quot; The Friday Review: The Essential Howard The Duck &quot;, Ninth Art, July 5, 2002 url accessed 21 March 2006 } Gerber addressed questions about the campaign in the letters column of the comic book and, as Mad Genius Associates, sold merchandise publicizing the campaign. Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived Howard the Duck newspaper comic strip from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik, [ June 2010 ] later written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Alan Kupperberg. [ June 2010 ] Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy when he became Howard the Duck&apos;s editor in addition to his writing duties, and the stories became increasingly experimental. [ June 2010 ] At one point, unable to meet the deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer. { &apos;&apos;Howard the Duck #16 } In 1978, the writer and publisher clashed over issues of creative control, { &quot; Marvel Fires Gerber &quot;, } { The Comics Journal #41 (August 1978), p. 7 } and Gerber was abruptly removed from the series. This was one of the first highly publicized creator&apos;s rights case in American comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to dramatize the case; these included Destroyer Duck with Jack Kirby. Disney also threatened to sue Marvel for infringing Donald Duck&apos;s copyright and enforced a different design, including the use of pants (as seen in the movie and some later comics). { Steve Gerber: The Dark Duck Returns: Interviews &amp; Features Archive - Comics Bulletin } The series continued for four more issues with stories by Marv Wolfman, Mary Skrenes, Mark Evanier, and Bill Mantlo. Gerber returned briefly to write, though not plot, #29 as part of a contract fulfillment. Issue #31, dated May 1979, announced on its letters page that it would be the final issue of Howard the Duck as a color comic. Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and Michael Golden and unrelated backup features by others; this series was canceled after nine issues. Articles in these issues claimed that Howard was Mayerik&apos;s idea, though this is contrary to statements by both Gerber and Mayerik (it would, however, conform to the &quot; Marvel way &quot; of comics creation—art first—akin to Kirby&apos;s creation of Silver Surfer without initial input from Stan Lee ). In issue #6, Mantlo introduced the concept of &quot; Duckworld, &quot; which Gerber loathed. It depicted an all-duck parallel earth in which there were equivalents of all famous people, such as &quot; Ducktor Strange &quot; (a parody of Doctor Strange ) who later appeared in She-Hulk (vol. 2 #19) and Truman Capoultry ( Truman Capote ), who narrated the issue. As Gerber told Mediascene, &quot; Howard&apos;s world, which would never be depicted visually, was inhabited by other anthropomorphized animals like himself. Like the cartoon worlds of Disney and Warner Brothers. Unlike the Disney and Warners worlds, however, Howard&apos;s reality was beset with the same plethora of social ills and personal vicissitudes which human beings confront daily. And the same, or similar, laws of nature applied there, too. &quot; The first story of issue #9, written by Bill Mantlo, had Howard walk away from Beverly, and what happened to him next was documented in a story by Steve Skeates the same issue. Steven Grant followed this with a story in Bizarre Adventures #34, in which the suicidal Howard is put through a parody of It&apos;s a Wonderful Life. The original comic book series reappeared in early 1986 with issue #32, written by Grant. Issue #33, a parody of Bride of Frankenstein, written by Christopher Stager, appeared nine months later, along with a three-issue adaptation of the movie. Harvey Pekar, himself a Cleveland resident, was mentioned as a possible writer for issue #33, but he was unavailable, and nothing came of it. { Howard the Duck #33 } In a story rejected by Jim Shooter, Marvel&apos;s then- editor-in-chief, Gerber explained that &quot; a Krylorian Cyndi Lauper &quot; named Chirreep had made up the events in the Mantlo stories much like the events in The Rampaging Hulk magazine were considered made up by Bereet, though those stories, as originally conceived, were intended to fill in material left by the publication gap between Incredible Hulk #6 and the Hulk&apos;s appearances in Tales to Astonish. Shooter considered this an insult to Mantlo, not regarding the insult Mantlo&apos;s stories may have been to Gerber (Mantlo himself had used the Krylorians to erase Doug Moench &apos;s contributions to the Hulk&apos;s continuity), and Gerber&apos;s story was never illustrated. He also identified Howard&apos;s parents as Dave and Dotty, names that differ from the Mantlo stories, in which his parents are named Ronald and Henrietta. { SteveGerber.com - Scripts } Gerber&apos;s script also lampooned Secret Wars, written by Jim Shooter, but Shooter has denied this played any role in choosing to reject the story, insisting that he only took issue with the insults to Mantlo. { http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/08/gerber-and-duck-part-2.html } Gerber brought back Howard in The Sensational She-Hulk #14-17, again living with Beverly, now working as a rent-a- ninja. How they got back together is never explained, and Beverly is not involved as She-Hulk takes Howard on a trip through several dimensions with a theoretical physicist from Empire State University. Gerber returned to Howard with Spider-Man Team-Up #5, around the same time he was writing a &quot; Savage Dragon /Destroyer Duck &quot; crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was also scheduled to appear in Ghost Rider vol. 3, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy, and issues of Generation X leading up to issue #25 and the Daydreamers miniseries by J.M. DeMatteis. Gerber was not pleased with this development, and changed the &quot; unofficial crossover &quot; somewhat. { Steve Gerber official blog item (dead link) } In the Spider-Man comic, Spider-Man and Howard meet two shadowy figures (presumed to be Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck) in a darkened warehouse, then leave shortly afterwards. But in the Savage Dragon comic, a villain creates hundreds of clones of Howard during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse with a character hidden in a bag, they reveal that they rescued the “real” Howard, while Spider-Man left with one of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed “Leonard the Duck,” which is now a character owned by Gerber, who went on to appear in Image Comics and Vertigo comics. Gerber considers this the real Howard, and Marvel&apos;s Howard an empty shell. In 2001, when Marvel launched its MAX imprint of &quot; mature readers &quot; comics, Gerber returned to write the six-issue Howard the Duck miniseries, illustrated by Phil Winslade and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar Howard the Duck characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and pop culture figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier. The series has Doctor Bong causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a rat (possibly as a parody of Mickey Mouse, in retaliation for the earlier lawsuit), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as Witchblade, Preacher and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with God in Hell. Howard had cameo appearances in She-Hulk #9 (Feb. 2005) and vol. 2, #3/100 (Feb. 2006, the 100th issue of all the various She-Hulk series). He returned in a limited series by writer Ty Templeton and artist Juan Bobillo in 2007. This series is rated for ages 9 and up, though it has also been published with a Marvel Zombies tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim. [ Fictional character biography ] [ section April 2011 ] Howard is abducted from New Stork City on his native world and dropped into the Florida Everglades by the demonic Thog the Overmaster of the dread realm Sominus. { Marvel Treasury Edition #12 (1976) } There, he meets the Man-Thing and Korrek the Barbarian. { Fear #19 } Shortly thereafter, Howard meets Dakimh the Enchanter and Jennifer Kale as well, but then falls off a set of inter-dimensional stepping stones. { Man-Thing #1 } Before long, he materializes in Cleveland, Ohio. There he battles Garko the Man-Frog, { Giant-Size Man-Thing #4 } after which he is arrested for disturbing the peace and mistaken for a mutant during a strip search. Upon release (because the officer fears he has mutant abilities that could be used against him), he encounters a vampire cow, Bessie the Hellcow. { Giant-Size Man-Thing #5 } Howard soon meets artists&apos; model Beverly Switzler and a bizarre series of encounters follows. He battles Pro-Rata, the cosmic accountant, who hired Beverley and held her prisoner, and then meets Spider-Man. { Howard the Duck #1 } He battles Turnip-Man and the Kidney Lady. { Howard the Duck #2 } He then learns Quak Fu, { Howard the Duck #3 } encounters the Winky Man, a sleepwalking alter ego of Beverly&apos;s artist friend, Paul Same, who would become a series regular (and share the apartment), { Howard the Duck #4 } and becomes a wrestler. { Howard the Duck #5 } Howard and Beverely hit the road, seeking shelter in a gothic mansion where they battle an animated Gingerbread Man. { Howard the Duck #6-7 } They eventually end up in New York City, where Howard is nominated for U.S. President by the All-Night Party. { Howard the Duck #7 } Howard battles the Band of the Bland — Dr. Angst, Sitting Bullseye, Tillie the Hun, the Spanker, and Black Hole — alongside the Defenders. { Marvel Treasury #12 } A doctored-photo scandal leads him to Canada, and the defeat of a supervillain, Le Beaver, who falls to his death. { Howard the Duck #9 } Howard then suffers a nervous breakdown, and flees Bev and their situation on a bus. Unfortunately, the passengers are all believers in various weird cults, and try to interest Howard in them. His seatmates are Winda Wester (afflicted with an Elmer Fudd -like speech impediment ) and S. Blotte the Kidney Lady. After the bus crashes, Howard and Winda are sent to a mental institution. There he meets Daimon Hellstrom, and is briefly possessed by Hellstrom&apos;s demonic soul, becoming the Son of Satan. { Howard the Duck #10-14 } Beverly and Paul get them both back to Cleveland. Later, while on a cruise ship returning from scenic Bagmom, Howard and Beverly are taken captive by Lester Verde, who had a crush on Beverly in college and is now in the identity of the supervillain Doctor Bong, { Howard the Duck #15 } who illegally marries Beverly against her will and transforms Howard into a human. { Howard the Duck #18-19 } After escaping back to New York and being restored to his natural form, Howard is hired as a dishwasher by Beverly&apos;s uncle and namesake, who goes by Lee. Howard battles Sudd, { Howard the Duck #20 } and then battles Soofi. { Howard the Duck #21 } Howard is then reunited with the Man-Thing, Korrek, and Jennifer Kale, and they all battle Bzzk&apos;Joh. { Howard the Duck #22-23 } After finally meeting up with the cruise ship that rescues Paul and Winda, now befriended by socialite Iris Raritan, he then attends her party on Long Island, where he is abducted by the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime. Paul is shot and left in a coma, and Winda, abandoned by Paul and Iris, is apparently rape d by a hobo. { Howard the Duck #25-27 } After defeating the Circus of Crime, Howard, plagued by pessimistic dreams, goes his way alone, as he had at the beginning of the series. { Howard the Duck #27 } Mantlo, beginning with Issue #30, returned the series to its former status quo, bringing Beverly back into the picture and having her divorce Doctor Bong, and getting Paul, who has been shot by the Ringmaster, out of the hospital. Lee Switzler brings everyone back to Cleveland and employs Howard as a cab driver, while Paul, back to being a somnambulist after his release from the hospital, seems to have become Winda&apos;s boyfriend. Howard dons a suit of &quot; Iron Duck &quot; armor, and battles Doctor Bong. { Howard the Duck #30-31 } He later battles Morton Erg and the Gopher. { Howard the Duck #32 } He encountered Dracula, { Howard the Duck Magazine #5 } and even returns to Duckworld at one point. { Howard the Duck Magazine #6 } At the end of the magazine series, Howard walks away from Beverly (at her request). After that, he is mistaken for &quot; Duck Drake, Private Eye &quot;, meets CeCe Ryder when hitchhiking, and is later offered a genetically constructed mate whom he does not take to. She-Hulk accidentally pulls him though a cosmic wormhole, and along with theoretical physicist Brent Wilcox, they prevent other universes from crowding out Earth-616. By this point, Beverly is working as a rent-a- ninja. Howard met the Critic, and traveled to the Baloneyverse, and battled Dr. Angst and his cohorts. { Sensational She-Hulk #14-16 } In an encounter with Peter Parker, Ben Reilly (then-current Spider-Man), and a rematch with the Circus of Crime, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck. The group leaves the warehouse believing that they have brought the correct Howard with them. { Spider-Man Team-Up #5 } The sorceress Jennifer Kale, in a weekly attempt to return Howard (a Howard with stubble who accuses her and Doctor Strange of being responsible for bringing him to this world) to his home world, inadvertently teleports Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy into her New York apartment. The disoriented dinosaur attempts to eat Howard, but spits him out when shot with John Blaze &apos;s hellfire gun, then rampages through the city before being subdued by Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch). Howard relates to the pair being trapped in a world he never made, and wanders off. { Ghost Rider vol. 3 #81-82 } [ Heroes Reborn ] After giving a ride from the western desert and becoming involved in an anti-mutant bar brawl with Chamber and Skin, assisting the mutants with his knowledge of Quack-Fu, Howard and Beverly (apparently back together with Howard again working as a driver) spend Thanksgiving at Charles Xavier &apos;s Massachusetts Academy. Chamber, however, is celebrating Thanksgiving with Husk &apos;s family, and the young mutants Artie Maddicks, Leech, and Franklin Richards are intrigued by the pair, inviting Beverly and dragging Howard to a treehouse where they have hidden the visiting Rigellian Tana Nile. Working as a video store clerk in Cleveland, Beverly gets him to play a department store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole, where Santa Claus has sold out to HYDRA. Some time after Christmas, Howard returns alone to his friends&apos; treehouse, and during a battle with a rampaging Black Tom Cassidy, the group escapes with the apparent help of the Man-Thing. { Generation X #20-21, 23, Howard the Duck Holiday Special! #1, Generation X #25 (Oct.-Nov. 1996, Jan., Feb., March 1997) } Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, has a sister named Princess, and is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld&apos;s version of Reed Richards. This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin&apos;s mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. { Daydreamers 1-3 } When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing&apos;s swamp. While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard went off on his own and was captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrapped him in swaddling clothes. { Man-Thing vol. 3 #5 } Although we last saw him in the swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside him, which he knows because it is making him nauseous. Man-Thing enters his gullet, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but the former is left desiccated and practically dead. { Man-Thing vol. 3 #6 } He then encountered Namor, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explains that he would not be lugging his friend&apos;s body if that were the case. Howard sets Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during the conversation with Namor. Once he sees that Man-Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says he is returning to Cleveland. { Man-Thing vol. 3 #7 } Back with Beverly, he undergoes further shape-shifting experiments from Doctor Bong. Beverly is hired by Verde&apos;s Globally Branded Content Corporation, which manufactures boy band s from protein vats based on the sexual arousal of a focus group of gay men. Attempting to destroy an escapee whom Beverly has taken in, Bong inadvertently knocks Howard into a vat, which changes him, unstably, into a mouse { Howard the Duck vol. 2 #1 } --showering changes his form multiple times. Verde then goes to the press and claims that his building was attacked by Osama el-Barka ( &quot; Osama the Duck &quot; in Arabic). Howard and Beverly are sent back on the road after the junkyard office where they are living is destroyed by a S.W.A.T. team. { Howard the Duck vol, 2 #2 } Denied admittance to every possible shelter due to lack of funds, the pair and their dog find a sign for the Boarding House of Mystery, but are taken to the police station for questioning and strip search es by Suzy Pazuzu, with whom Beverly had attended high school. One of the officers on the case is the same beat cop who mistook Howard for a mutant many years before. Suzy is the inheritor of the douche blade, which starts to take her over until in a skirmish, the bracelet is caught by Howard. The doucheblade causes its holder to grow enormous bare breasts and armor in a parody of Witchblade, and possessed by this, Howard kills the male lover of a businessman who works with Verde as he and Verde break into Suzy&apos;s house. { Howard the Duck vol. 2 #3 } Arriving at the Boarding House of Mystery, Howard and Beverly encounter Cain and Abel, the latter with a rock stuck in his head that allows him only moments of lucidity. There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard&apos;s return to his true form, and Beverly never being tight again, and meet parodies of John Constantine, Wesley Dodds, The Endless, Spider Jerusalem, and Gerber&apos;s own Nevada (called Utah), all characters from DC Comics &apos; Vertigo imprint. The downside is that everyone staying in the place gets their every wish, so Che Guevara can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him. { Howard the Duck vol. 2 #4 } One tenant, a writer named Mr. Gommorah (a parody of Spider Jerusalem ), takes Beverly and Howard to be on the Iprah Show with the topic &quot; Why Women Give It to Men Who Don&apos;t Get It, &quot; guest starring Dr. Phlip. Upon leaving the house, Howard is once again transformed into a mouse. Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the Angel Gabriel called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. Deuteronomy is a creature half id and half superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends Cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher&apos;s brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell. { Howard the Duck vol. 2 #5 } He is eventually freed by Yah, a being who claims to be &quot; God &quot;. { Howard the Duck vol. 2 #6 } In Adam Beechen &apos;s ending of Doctor Fate : More Pain Comics, which Gerber left unfinished when he died, Howard, who is heard but unseen (his speech balloon ends with &quot; waaugh &quot; ), dispatched the Elf with a Gun to destroy Negal and Ymp, then invited to Elf for one last drink with Yah, Bev, Thunny, and Megs before Yah goes back &quot; upstairs. &quot; { Countdown to Mystery #8 } [ Civil War ] Sometime later, Howard attempts to register under the Superhero Registration Act during the superhero Civil War, but learns his socially disrupted life has created so many bureaucratic headaches that the government&apos;s policy is that Howard does not exist. This lack of government oversight delights him: &quot; No more parking tickets, no taxes, no jury duty &quot;. In this story Howard says he was also pressured to give up his cigars. { Civil War: Choosing Sides #1 (Feb. 2006) } However, after he defeats the supervillain M.O.D.O.T. &apos;s scheme to control the public through mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, successfully restores his citizenship including all relevant responsibilities. { Howard The Duck #4 (Jan 2008) } [ Secret Invasion ] Howard the Duck is briefly seen as part of the super-powered army gathered to battle invading Skrull forces. { Secret Invasion #6 (2008) and The New Avengers #36 (2008) } He is seen armed with a pistol, a Skrull&apos;s hand around his neck. { Secret Invasion #7 (2008) } He is later seen kicking a Skrull during interrogation after the invasion. { Secret Invasion#8 (2008) } However, Brian Michael Bendis has commented when asked of Howard: &quot; That character has shown up in six issues I&apos;ve done, and I&apos;ve never typed the words Howard the Duck &quot;. [ Marvel Zombies 5 ] [ Marvel Zombies 5 ] In the Marvel Zombies 5 Howard the Duck of Earth-616 teams with Machine Man to travel across the multiverse fighting zombies. { Marvel Zombies 5 #1 } [ &lt; link &gt; &lt; wikilink href= &quot; Fear Itself (comics) &quot; &gt; Fear Itself (comics) &lt; /wikilink &gt; &lt; wikishort &gt; Fear Itself &lt; /wikishort &gt; &lt; /link &gt; ] During the events of Fear Itself, Howard forms a team called the Fearsome Four with She-Hulk, Frankenstein&apos;s Monster and Nighthawk to stop the Man-Thing ­. [ August 2011 ] [ Powers and abilities ] Howard has no superhuman powers, but he is skilled in the martial art known as Quack-Fu, enough to beat or to hold his own against far larger opponents. He also has shown some degree of mystic talent in the past, to the point that Stephen Strange taught some spells to Howard and even offered to train him, but Howard declined. [ January 2011 ] On occasion, Howard used a suit of powered armor known as the &quot; Iron Duck &quot; designed by Claude Starkowski. Besides its property as body armor, the suit was equipped with foot-mounted leaping coils, a chest-mounted searchlight, and a flamethrower in its left arm. { Howard the Duck Vol.1 #30 } [ Characteristics and associations ] [ section August 2010 ] Howard the Duck, as his name suggests, is a three-foot-tall anthropomorphic duck. He generally wears a tie and shirt, and is almost always found smoking a cigar. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; Disney threatened legal action due to Howard&apos;s resemblance to Donald Duck, [ February 2012 ] and Marvel redesigned that aspect of the character by writing into the script that Howard was the target of anti-nudity protests, and was forced to do business with &quot; Wally Sidney &quot;, a failed cartoonist who made his fortune through a chain of conservative clothing retailers known as &quot; Sidney World &quot;. Howard tries on various outfits, to include ones akin to Donald Duck&apos;s sailor uniform and Uncle Scrooge &apos;s coat and top hat before settling on his new attire of a business suit complete with trousers. Although Howard sulks that he has lost, Beverly reassures him that she does not want him to be a victim of a mob, and loves him no matter what he wears. [ February 2012 ] Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude to the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series&apos; tagline, &quot; Trapped in a world he never made &quot;, played off the genre trappings of 1950s science fiction. A common reaction to meeting Howard the first time is a startled, &quot; You...you&apos;re a DUCK! &quot; His near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and Cleveland native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though she is a beautiful and sexy woman rather than a duck. Their only other friends are Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a sleepwalking crime -fighter) and Winda Wester (a lisp ing ingénue with psychic powers); he has also worked with Spider-Man and the Man-Thing and associates on various occasions. Howard found himself on Earth due to a shift in &quot; the Cosmic Axis &quot; from a world similar to Earth, but where there are &quot; more ducks &quot; and &quot; apes don&apos;t talk. &quot; In the black-and-white Howard the Duck magazine series, writer Bill Mantlo theorized that Howard came from an extra-dimensional planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it &quot; very pedestrian &quot; and &apos;comic-booky&apos; — in the worst sense of the term. &quot; He believes Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of cartoon animals. { &quot; Mad Genius, Angry Fowl &quot; Interview, Diamond Comic Distributors, 2001. Retrieved on 2007-04-06. } A panel in Fear #19, prior to Howard&apos;s introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic rat and an anthropomorphic dog, in a hypothetical panel about other dimensions. Destroyer Duck was depicted existing in such a world, and in Howard the Duck vol. 2 #6, Howard mentions that Moses is believed to be a moose in his world and Yeshua a flying squirrel. His antagonists, who usually appear in a single story each, are often parodies of science fiction, fantasy, and horror characters, and sometimes political figures, but also include ordinary people simply making life difficult for Howard. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, also known as Doctor Bong - modeled on Doctor Doom and writers Bob Greene and Lester Bangs - is a former tabloid reporter who has the power to &quot; reorder reality &quot; by smashing himself on his bell -shaped helmet; his main goal is to marry Beverly. After several issues, she agrees to marry him to save Howard from Bong&apos;s evil experimentation, and remains married to him for some time. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of She-Hulk and Deadpool in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady (S. Blotte) who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church &quot; Moonies &quot;. Another important villain was the Sinister S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring from Indecency) organization, whose leader was implicitly Anita Bryant, though she looked like an old, fat Elvis Presley with a smiley face / orange on her head. Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared, including Spider-Man, Daimon Hellstrom, and the Ringmaster. Also, Omega The Unknown appeared to him in a dream, as did the founding members of the rock group, KISS, and Spider-Man, whom he had previously met for real, unlike Omega. Seemingly an autodidact, Howard at various times references Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Albert Camus (whose novel The Stranger Gerber considers the principal influence on the series { Steve Gerber: An Absurd Journey Part I: Interviews &amp; Features Archive - Comics Bulletin } ), the Brontë sisters, and other figures of philosophical and political significance. In a parody of the Marvel comic character Shang-Chi, he was trained in the art of Quak-Fu. In the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking gesture toward Disney&apos;s mascot Mickey Mouse, he was turned into various animals, primarily a mouse. [ Other versions ] [ Amalgam ] In the Amalgam Comics universe, Howard the Duck is fused with Lobo ( DC ) to become Lobo the Duck. This character is featured in its own one-shot comic book, a seeming continuation of multiple other &apos;Lobo The Duck&apos; stories. Lobo the Duck #1 In the letter page of Bat-Thing #1, there was mention of a fictional upcoming &apos;special issue&apos; featuring Howard the Mxyzptlk, presumably a merging of Howard with Mister Mxyzptlk. Bat-Thing #1 [ Marvel Zombies ] An alternate version of Howard the Duck becomes infected with the zombie plague, and eats the brains of the alternate-Ash that is native to the Marvel Universe. He is swiftly slain by the Scarlet Witch and the original Ash Williams of the Evil Dead series. Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness #2-3 [ MC2 ] Howard is seen as a blindfold-wearing martial arts teacher. J2 #11 [ Ultimate ] [ April 2010 ] In the limited series Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars, a billboard advertising for &quot; HDTV &quot; is seen in the first panel, showing Howard. Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars [ Universe X ] While he does not appear, the Beast says &quot; I still feel badly about Howard &quot; who had been &quot; hunted down and consumed &quot;. Universe X: Beasts #1 In the original draft for Earth X, Howard was supposedly served as a feast during the Skull&apos;s invasion of New York City. The scene was cut due to space constraints. &quot; The Skull &quot;, &quot; The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe &quot;, &quot; &quot; [ In other media ] [ Television ] Howard the Duck was seen on Beast &apos;s shirt on the animated series X-Men (The Phoenix Saga Part 2). [ Film ] In 1986, Lucasfilm and Universal Pictures produced the movie Howard the Duck, starring Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, Tim Robbins, and, as the voice of Howard, Chip Zien. Besides Howard (who was portrayed by an assortment of stunt actors in a duck suit) the only character borrowed from the Marvel Comics mythos was Beverly Switzler, though in this version she was a rock singer. In the film, Howard is brought to Cleveland by a laser spectroscope experiment gone awry, which also summoned an evil alien, one of the Dark Overlords of the Universe, who intended to sacrifice all human life in order to free the others of its kind from their celestial prison. The film was widely panned and was a box office bomb. There was also a novelization and a comic adaptation of the film. [ Other comics ] In Savage Dragon / Destroyer Duck #1 (Nov. 1996), Gerber claims that Howard and Beverly Switzler changed their names to Leonard the Duck and Rhonda Martini, remained in the Image Universe and &quot; were last sighted in Chicago boarding the Amtrak for Buffalo &quot; while the duck who returned to Marvel is &quot; only an empty trademark, a clone whose soul departed him at the corner of Floss and Regret &quot;. &quot; Fowl Play: the Behind-the Scenes Story of Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck #1 by Steve Gerber 1996 This was done because Tom Brevoort invited Gerber to write the comic, claiming he was the only one to write Howard, then Gerber noticed the Howard guest appearances in Ghost Rider and Generation X and felt as though he had been tricked. Stevegerblog (Steve Gerber blog) [ April 2009 ] In the Kitchen Sink Press series Megaton Man, a comedy relief character is Gower Goose, who is an intended parody of Howard. In the Claypool Comics series Elvira Mistress of the Dark, Gordon the Goose (clearly modelled on Howard) appears, together with Dorkheem the Sorcerer and Heap-Thing. (issues #49, 58 &amp; 59) In America&apos;s Best Comics &apos;s Top 10 #8 a duck appearing to be Howard (with his distinctive blue hat &amp; jacket) can be seen at the Transworld Transport Terminus. In several issues of The Maxx, Howard appears, along with many other characters, seemingly cut and pasted into the story. [ February 2012 ] One ending to a She-Hulk comic had a Marvel employee mysteriously trapped on Duckworld. Although Howard does not appear, it is a reverse of what Howard has gone through as Duckworld natives eye this man with fear and awe, and is watched suspiciously by a duck police officer. The crawl says &quot; Trapped in a world he never made: Stu the Human! &quot; [ Newspaper comic strip ] Between June 1977 and October 1978, Howard the Duck appeared in a daily comic strip that comic strip historian Allan Holtz has described as having low distribution and that was eventually replaced by the Hulk strip. { Obscurity of the Day: Howard the Duck } Among the handful of newspapers it appeared in were the Toronto Star and Spokane Daily Chronicle. A total of eleven story arcs, as well as a number of single-joke strips, constitute the 511 individual strips that were printed. { &apos;&apos;Howard the Duck&apos;&apos; strip listing/compilation } The strip started with original stories written by Steve Gerber and illustrated by Gene Colan: &quot; Pop Syke &quot;, &quot; The Cult of the Entropy &quot; and &quot; The Self Made Man &quot;. The latter was started by Colan and completed by Val Mayerik, who stayed on to do two additional Gerber scripted stories: &quot; The Sleigh Jacking &quot; and &quot; In Search of the Good Life &quot;. These were followed by an adaptation of the &quot; Sleep of the Just &quot; story from issue 4 of the Marvel comic, scripted by Gerber and illustrated by Alan Kupperberg. Colan&apos;s departure (and eventually Gerber&apos;s) grew out of escalating disagreements fueled by a dispute with Marvel over the delay in payment for work on the strip. { Steve Gerber&apos;s Crazy Days Comic Book Artist Collection v.3, pp. 66 } Gerber was replaced by Marv Wolfman as writer while Alan Kupperberg continued as artist. The remaining stories were: &quot; Close Encounters of the Fowl Kind &quot;, &quot; The Tuesday Ruby &quot;, &quot; The Clone Ranger &quot;, &quot; The Mystery of the Maltese Human &quot; and &quot; Howard Heads Home &quot;. As the series drew to an end, its already meager list of client papers shank, making copies of these last (post Gerber) stories particularly hard to find. In 1978, the first of a projected eight-issue series reprinting the entire strip was released. Titled It&apos;s Adventure Time with Howard the Duck, only the initial issue was published. { It&apos;s Adventure Time With Howard the Duck (1978) comic books } [ Merchandise ] { 7-11 } { glassware series &quot; Super Heroes &quot; from 1977. } Marvel Max Howard the Duck Statue sculpted by Gentle Giant Studios. Howard appears on a mid-1970s painted drinking glass and a plastic cup from 7-11 convenience stores. [ Toys ] A Howard the Duck action figure is sold together with Toy Biz &apos;s Marvel Legends Series 5 Silver Surfer figure. The only such figure as of 2009, it uses the original, pant-less version of the character.
