[ Warren warren ] [ Definition ] Warren originates in the Anglo-Norman term free warren, a royal licence permitting the holder to keep and breed game animals within a defined geographic area in which hunting by others was prohibited. The word is of High Germanic origin werien, to preserve. The word has survived in common usage today only to define a place where rabbits breed and live, thus a network of underground interconnecting rabbit burrows, and by analogy an overcrowded place or building. A warrener was an officer akin to a modern game keeper appointed to enforce the holder&apos;s right to maintain his warren.
