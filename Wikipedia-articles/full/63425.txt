Saint-Exupéry, also a fiercely patriotic military pilot, had wisely fled occupied France after the German invasion of WWII and after having been interrogated by German authorities in Paris, with his literary works subsequently being banned by the Vichy government.

The designation was applied to Saint-Exupéry&apos;s estate in 1948.

He had traveled there on a personal mission to convince its government to quickly enter the war against Nazi Germany. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health he produced almost half of the writings he would be remembered for, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince fallen to Earth. An earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara desert and he is thought to have drawn on those same experiences for use as plot elements in The Little Prince. Since first being published the novella has been adapted to various media over the decades, including audio recording s, stage, screen, ballet and opera tic works.

For example, Saint-Exupéry tells of a fox meeting the young prince during his travels on Earth. The story&apos;s essence is contained in the lines uttered by the fox to the little prince: On ne voit bien qu&apos;avec le cœur. L&apos;essentiel est invisible pour les yeux. ( &quot; One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye. &quot; ) { Galembert, Laurent de Bodin de. &apos;&apos;Idée, Idéalisme et Idéologie Dons les Oeuvres Choisies de Saint Exupéry&apos;&apos; (thèse), Université Paris IV, 29 Juin 2000, p.13. } Other key thematic messages are articulated by the fox, such as: &quot; You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed &quot; and &quot; It is the time you have devoted to your rose that makes your rose so important. &quot; [ Plot ] The reader is introduced to the narrator who, as a young boy, drew a boa constrictor eating an elephant. However, he is discouraged from drawing when all adults who look at his picture see a hat, instead. The narrator attempts to explain what his first picture depicts by drawing another one clearly showing the elephant, disturbing the adults as a result. As such, he decides to become a pilot, which eventually leads to a crash in the Sahara desert. In the desert, the narrator meets the little prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. Not knowing how to draw a sheep, the narrator shows him the picture of the elephant in the snake. To the narrator&apos;s surprise, the prince recognizes the drawing for what it is. After a few failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the narrator draws a box in his frustration, claims that the box holds a sheep inside. Again to the narrator&apos;s surprise, the prince is delighted with the result. The little prince&apos;s home asteroid, or &quot; planet &quot;, is introduced. The asteroid is the size of a house, has three volcano es (two active, and one dormant) and a rose, among various other objects. The narrator believes this asteroid to be called B-612. The Prince spends his days caring for the asteroid, pulling out the baobab trees that are constantly trying to take root there. The Prince falls in love with the rose, who appears not to return his love due to her vain nature. The Prince loses his trust in the rose after she lies to him, and grows lonely. After he reconciles with his rose, the prince leaves to see what the rest of the universe is like. He visits six other asteroids, each of which is inhabited by a foolish adult. The sixth asteroid is inhabited by a geographer, who asks the prince to describe his home. When the prince mentions the rose, the geographer explains that he does not record roses, calling them &quot; ephemeral &quot;. The prince is shocked and hurt by this revelation. The geographer recommends that he visit the Earth. { Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine. } On the Earth, the prince meets a snake that claims to have the power to return him to his home planet, though the prince refuses this offer. The prince then meets a desert flower, who tells him that there are only a handful of men on Earth and that they have no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. The prince climbs the highest mountain he has ever seen, in hopes of seeing the whole planet and finding people. However, he only sees a desolate landscape. When the prince calls out, his echo answers him, and he mistakes it for the voices of other humans. Eventually, the prince comes upon a whole row of rosebushes, and becomes downcast because he thought that his rose was unique. He begins to feel that he is not a great prince at all, as his planet contains only three tiny volcanoes and a flower he now thinks of as common. He lies down in the grass and weeps. As the prince cries, a fennec fox comes across him. The prince tames the fox, who explains to him that his rose really is unique and special, because she is the one whom the prince loves. The fox also explains that, in a way, the prince has tamed the flower, and that this is why the prince now feels responsible for her. The prince then comes across a railway switchman and a merchant. The switchman tells the Prince how passengers constantly rush from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they are and not knowing what they are after. Only the children amongst them bother to look out of the windows. The merchant tells the prince about his product, a pill which eliminates thirst and is very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replies that he would use the time to walk and find fresh water. Back in the present, the narrator is dying of thirst, but finds a well with the help of the prince. The narrator later finds the prince discussing his return home with the snake. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is because his body is too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will make him sad. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince&apos;s side. The prince allows the snake to bite him, and falls without making a sound. The next morning, the narrator tries to look for the prince, but is unable to find his body. The story ends with a portrait of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince&apos;s life. The narrator makes a plea that anyone encountering a strange child in that area who refuses to answer questions should contact the narrator immediately. [ Inspirations ] [ Events and characters ] Saint-Exupéry next to his crashed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after impacting the Sahara Desert about 3  am during an air race to Saigon. His survival ordeal was about to begin. In The Little Prince, its narrator, The Pilot, talks of being stranded in the desert beside his crashed aircraft. This account clearly drew on Saint-Exupéry&apos;s own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir Wind, Sand and Stars (original French: Terre des hommes). On December 30, 1935 at 02:45  am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exupéry, along with his copilot-navigator André Prévot, crashed in the Sahara desert. { Schiff 1996, p.258. } They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight and win a prize of 150,000   francs. Their plane was a Caudron C-630 Simoun, [ The plane Saint-Exupéry was flying when he crashed in the Sahara was a Caudron C-630 Simoun, Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY. &quot; Note &quot; ] and the crash site is thought to have been near to the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta. { Schiff 1996, p.263. } Both miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat. Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day&apos;s worth of liquid. They both began to see mirage s, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucination s. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment that saved Saint-Exupéry and Prévot&apos;s lives. { Schiff, Stacy. Saint-Exupéry: A Biography, New York, 1994, Da Capo. pp.256–267. } During his service as a mail pilot in the North African Sahara desert, Saint-Exupéry had viewed a fennec (desert sand fox), which most likely inspired him to create the fox character in the book. In a letter written to his sister Didi from the Western Sahara&apos;s Cape Juby, where he was the manager of an airmail stopover station in 1928, he tells of raising a fennec which he adored. The Rose in &apos;&apos;The Little Prince&apos;&apos; was likely based on Saint-Exupéry&apos;s Salvadoran wife, Consuelo. Many researchers believe that the prince&apos;s petulant, vain rose was very likely inspired by his Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint Exupéry, with the small home planet being inspired by her small home country El Salvador, also known as &quot; The Land of Volcanoes &quot; due to the area having so many of them. { Saint-Exupéry, Consuelo de, 2003 } Despite a raucous marriage, Antoine kept Consuelo close to heart and portrayed her as the prince&apos;s Rose whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exupéry&apos;s infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth. In the novella the Wise Fox, believed to be modeled after the author&apos;s intimate New York City friend Sylvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, because she is the one that he loves. The novella&apos;s iconic phrase, &quot; One sees clearly only with the heart &quot;, is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt. The fearsome, grasping baobab trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent Nazism attempting to destroy the planet. The little prince&apos;s reassurance to the pilot that his dying body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine&apos;s dying younger brother François, who told the author, from his deathbed: &quot; Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;m all right. I can&apos;t help it. It&apos;s my body &quot;. { Saint-Exupéry, Antoine de. Airman&apos;s Odyssey, Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, 1942. } The literary device of presenting philosophical and social commentaries in the form of the impressions gained by a fictional extraterrestrial visitor to Earth had already been used by the philosopher and satirist Voltaire in his story Micromégas of 1752—a classic work in French literature which Saint-Exupéry was likely familiar with. [ The Prince ] Saint-Exupéry may have drawn inspiration for the prince&apos;s character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him le Roi-Soleil (the Sun King) due to his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight year old with curly blond hair while residing with a family in Quebec City, Canada in 1942, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck. [ Schiff 1996 378 ] [ Brown 2004 ] Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as that of Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Morrow, who lived not far from Saint-Exupéry and who met with him briefly during his stay on Long Island. [ Dunning 1989 ] { Hoffman, William. A Flight To Eternity, Doric Column, 16 December 1998. Retrieved 16 October 2011. } [ According to Hoffman: &quot; Anne Morrow Lindbergh &apos;s fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another. &quot; Saint-Exupéry visited with Anne for a day and but spoke with Charles, who arrived home late, just once, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how Hitler and the European conflict should be treated, Charles didn&apos;t speak French, and Saint-Exupéry didn&apos;t speak English. Their discussion, passed through Anne&apos;s meager French, were somewhat muted. Ironically, while Saint-Exupéry was campaigning for an early U.S. entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and favored a peace treaty with Hitler, similar to Stalin&apos;s. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed &quot;...less than a rousing success. Moreover, Charles was not happy about his wife&apos;s vast esteem for the French adventurer. &quot; &quot; Note &quot; ] One of Saint-Exupéry&apos;s earliest literary references to a small prince was found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated May 14, 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for Paris-Soir the author described his transit from France to the U.S.S.R. by train. Late at night during the train trip he ventured from his first class accommodation into the third class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince, but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exupéry incorporated into various philosophical writings: { Saint-Exupéry, Antoine de. A Sense of Life, Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1965, pg. 37. } [ I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple. Between the man and the woman a child had hollowed himself out a place and fallen asleep. He turned in his slumber, and in the dim lamplight I saw his face. What an adorable face! A golden fruit had been born of these two peasants..... This is a musician&apos;s face, I told myself. This is the child Mozart. This is a life full of beautiful promise. Little princes in legends are not different from this. Protected, sheltered, cultivated, what could not this child become? When by mutation a new rose is born in a garden, all gardeners rejoice. They isolate the rose, tend it, foster it. But there is no gardener for men. This little Mozart will be shaped like the rest by the common stamping machine.... This little Mozart is condemned. –A Sense Of Life: En Route To The U.S.S.R. ] [ Novella&apos;s creation ] { Montreal, Canada in May, 1942 during a speaking tour in support of France after its armistice with Germany. He started his work on the novella shortly after returning to the United States. } Upon the outbreak of World War II, Saint-Exupéry, a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron in the Armée de l&apos;Air (French Air Force). After France&apos;s defeat in 1940 and its armistice with Germany, he and his wife Consuelo fled occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exupéry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against Germany and the Axis forces.

The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exupéry for several months, and noting his high stress levels and ill health, suggested to him that working on a children&apos;s story would help. { Schiff, 1996. pp. 278. } The author wrote and illustrated The Little Prince in New York City and Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October. { Cotsalas, Valerie (2000) &apos;&apos; &apos;The Little Prince&apos;: Born in Asharoken&apos;&apos;, } { The New York Times, 10 September 2000. } [ Schiff Stacy Stacy Schiff Saint-Exupery Owl Books 7 February 2006 379 http://books.google.com/books?visbn%3D0805079130%26amp%3Bid%3Dh-gk5R0OmI0C%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA379%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA379 978-0-8050-7913-5 ] { Bevin House on } { Long Island, N.Y., one of the locations where &apos;&apos;The Little Prince&apos;&apos; was written during 1942. } Although the book was started in his Central Park South penthouse, Saint-Exupéry soon found New York City&apos;s noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in, so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. The result was a new home: the Bevin House, a 22 room mansion in Asharoken overlooking Long Island Sound. The author-aviator initially complained &quot; I wanted a hut [but it&apos;s] the Palace of Versailles &quot;; however as the weeks wore on and the author became invested in the project, the home would become &quot;....a haven for writing, the best place I have ever had anywhere in my life &quot;. He devoted himself to the book on both extended daytime and midnight shifts, fueled by helpings of scrambled eggs on English muffins, gin and tonics, Coke-Colas, cigarettes and numerous reviews by friends and expatriates who dropped in to see on their famous countryman. Included among the reviewers was Consuelo&apos;s Swiss writer paramour Denis de Rougemont, who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air. [ Schiff Stacy http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/books/a-grounded-soul-saint-exupery-in-new-york.html?pagewanted%3Dall A Grounded Soul: Saint-Exupery in New York The New York Times 1993/05/30 2011/10/22 ] De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, The Tale of the Rose, as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exupéry. The large white Second French Empire style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments. It allowed him to alternately work on his writings, and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in order to follow the Sun&apos;s light. His meditative view of the sunsets at the Bevin House eventually became part of the gist of The Little Prince, in which 43 daily sunsets would be discussed. &quot; On your planet... &quot; the story told, &quot;...all you need do is move your chair a few steps. &quot; [ Saint-Exupéry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died. He originally wrote the story with 43 sunsets, but posthumous editions often quote &apos;44 sunsets&apos; in tribute. &quot; Note &quot; ] Only weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, before Saint-Exupéry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces. He would remain immensely proud of The Little Prince, and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war. { Schiff, Stacy. Bookend: Par Avion, } { The New York Times, 25 June 2000. } As part of a 32 ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot. Saint-Exupéry was lost in action in a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of Corsica to the continent in preparation for the Allied invasion of occupied France, some three weeks before the liberation of Paris. [ Illustrations ] All of the novella&apos;s simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exupéry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist—which he self-mockingly referred to in the novella&apos;s introduction. Several of his paintings were done on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice. As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits of the P-38 Lightnings he later flew. Two or three original Little Prince drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell. { Bourdon, David (1967) &apos;&apos;The Enigmatic Collector of Utopia Parkway&apos;&apos;, Life Magazine, 15 December 1967, pg. 63. } One rare original Little Prince watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007. { Frey, Christopher (2007) &quot; Read Your Own Adventure &quot;, Globe and Mail, 7 April 2006. } { Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (2007) &quot; Original Little Prince Drawing Found in Japan &quot;, CBC Arts, } { Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, April 4, 2007. } An unrepentant life-long doodler, Saint-Exupéry had for numerous years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angel&apos;s with wings, and even a similar Keep On Truckin&apos; figure later to be made famous by Robert Crumb. His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-ego, replied that they were actually pursuing a &quot; realistic ideal &quot;. Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. To mark the 50th anniversary of The Little Prince&apos;s publication, the Pierpont Morgan Library mounted a major exhibit of Saint-Exupéry&apos;s draft manuscript, preparatory drawings and similar materials which it had earlier obtained from various sources plus an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, which he gave to her just before he returned to Algiers to resume his work as a Free French Air Force pilot. A museum representative stated that the novella&apos;s final drawings were lost. The author had held back several drawings from the book which were displayed at the library&apos;s exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince&apos;s home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story&apos;s narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a &apos;literalness&apos; which would distract its readers. { Reif, Rita. &quot; A Charming Prince Turns 50, His Luster Intact &quot;, } { The New York Times, September 19, 1993. } In 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmized that the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for Le Petit Prince deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement chosen to celebrate the author&apos;s own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art Saint-Exupéry drew contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in 2000. { Shimbun, Yomiuri (2001) &quot; A Star-tling Centenarian Theory &quot;, Daily Yomiuri, 10 February 2001: YOSH15078493. Retrieved from Gale OneFile on 9 November 2011; Gale Document Number: GALE|A70253329. } Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied with the French Air Force. [ Manuscript ] The original autographed manuscript of The Little Prince, as well as various drafts and trial drawings were acquired in 1968 by the Pierpont Morgan Library (now The Morgan Library &amp; Museum ) in Manhattan, New York City. { Van Gelder, Lawrence. Footlights: Celestial Traveler, } { The New York Times, 9 May 2000. } The manuscript pages includes content that was struck-through and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The library marked the 50th anniversary of the novella&apos;s publication with a major exhibit of Saint-Exupéry&apos;s literary works. In April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that had been found and which included new text. In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an &quot; ambassador of the human spirit &quot;. The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word, &quot; I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means &apos;gargling&apos; &quot;, he says. Saint-Exupéry&apos;s text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be &quot; guerre &quot;, (or &quot; war &quot; ). The novella thus takes on a more politicized tact with an anti-war sentiment, as &apos;to gargle&apos; in French is an informal reference to &apos;honour&apos;, which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.
