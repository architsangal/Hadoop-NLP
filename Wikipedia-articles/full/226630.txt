The following is a list of English words without rhymes, called refractory rhymes—that is, a list of word s in the English language which rhyme with no other English word. The word &quot; rhyme &quot; here is used in the strict sense, called a perfect rhyme, that the words are pronounced the same from the vowel of the main stressed syllable onwards. The list was compiled from the point of view of Received Pronunciation (with a few exceptions for General American ), and may not work for other accents or dialects. Multiple-word rhymes (a phrase that rhymes with a word, known as a phrasal or mosaic rhyme), self-rhymes (adding a prefix to a word and counting it as a rhyme of itself), and identical rhymes (words that are identical in their stressed syllables, such as bay and obey) are often not counted as true rhymes and have not been considered. Only the list of one-syllable words can hope to be anything near complete; for polysyllabic words, rhymes are the exception rather than the rule. [ Definition of perfect rhyme ] Following the strict definition of rhyme, a perfect rhyme demands the exact match of all sounds from the last stressed vowel to the end of the word. Therefore, words with the stress far from the end are more likely to have no perfect rhymes. For instance, a perfect rhyme for discom BOB ulate would have to rhyme three syllables, - OB ulate. There are many words that match most of the sounds from the stressed vowel onwards and so are near rhymes, called slant rhyme s. Ovulate, copulate, and populate, for example, vary only slightly in one consonant, and thus provide very usable rhymes for most situations in which a rhyme for discombobulate is desired. However, no other English word has exactly these three final syllables with this stress pattern. { OED search for pronunciations ending in &quot; *QbjUleIt &quot;. } And since in most traditions the stressed syllable should not be identical—the consonant before the stressed vowel should be different—adding a prefix to a word, as be-elbow, does not create a perfect rhyme for it. Words that rhyme in one accent or dialect may not rhyme in another. A commonplace example of this is the word of, which when stressed had no rhymes in British Received Pronunciation prior to the 19th century, but which rhymed with love in General American. (When unstressed, it&apos;s a homonym for have.) { In RP, stressed of currently has the rhymes sov, short for sovereign, and Sov, short for Soviet. } In the other direction, iron has no rhyme in General American, but many in RP. Words may also have more than one pronunciation, one with a rhyme, and one without. [ Words with obscure perfect rhymes ] This lists includes rhymes of words that have been listed as rhymeless.

[ Masculine rhymes ] [ August 2008 ] Refractory one-syllable rhymes are uncommon; there may be fewer than a hundred in English. { In the August 1980 Kickshaws, Howard Bergerson listed 55, but rhymes have been found for some of them. Apart from those listed under &apos;obscure rhymes&apos; above, these are, beards – weirds; filched – obs. milched, dial. pilched, slang zilched; fluxed – betuxed (dressed in a tux), dial. muxed; jinxed – } { sphinxed, obs. nonce minxed; lairds – cairds (both Scottish); leashed – schottisched, niched (one pronunciation), Sc. creeshed; mouthed – southed (alt. pronunciation in Dict.com, but not OED); mulched – gulched; puss (cat, face) – wuss, schuss; scalds – tech. faulds, obs. balds, Sc. caulds &amp; spauld; tenth/s – } { nth/s; tufts – } { Crufts, } { yufts (Russian leather). } A great many end in a present or historical suffix -th, or are plural or participle forms. This list includes a few polysyllabic masculine rhyme s such as oblige, which have one syllable in their rhyming part. { Though Cole reported a phrasal rhyme in &quot; Elijah knew, oblige a Jew &quot;. } [ ˈ-æŋksts ] [ ˈɑːŋkst ] [ ˈ-ɛdθ(s) ] [ ˈ-ʌlb(z/d) ] [ ˈ-ʌsp(s/t) ] [ ˈ-ɛpθ(s) ] [ ˈ-eɪtθ(s) ] [ /ˈweitθ/ ] [ /ˈweiθ/ ] [ ˈ-ɪfθ(s/t) ] [ ˈ-ɪlmd ] [ ˈ-ɪmpst ] [ ˈ-ʌlft ] [ ˈ-ɪərʃ ] [ ˈ-ɪdsts ] [ ˈ-ʌlkts ] [ ˈ-aɪnθ(s) ] [ ˈ-aɪdʒ(d) ] [ ˈ-ʌlpts ] [ ˈ-aʊθt ] [ /ˈsaʊθt/ ] [ /ˈfaʊlmaʊθt/ ] [ /ˈsaʊðd/ ] [ ˈ-ɪksθ(s) ] [ ˈ-ɛlfθ(s) ] [ ˈ-aɪlst ] [ ˈ-ʊlf(s/t) ] [ ˈ-ʊlv(z/d) ] angsts The alternative American pronunciation has no rhymes even in the singular. breadth, -s bulb, -s, -ed Bulb can be assumed to rhyme with culb, an obsolete word (and hapax legomenon ) for a glass distillation vessel attested without pronunciation from 1683. cusp, -s, -ed depth, -s eighth, -s A possible rhyme with obsolete weighth, though it is not clear if that is or a non-rhyming. fifth, -s, -ed filmed The plural films rhymes with Wilms, a kidney tumor. glimpsed (en)gulfed kirsch midsts mulcts The infinitive mulct rhymes with sulked, bulked, etc. ninth, -s oblige, -ed sculpts sowthed, southed As. The verbs sowthed (as in sowthed a tune) and southed (pointed south) are identical and therefore not considered rhymes to each other. Phrases like foul-mouthed, though close, have the wrong stress to be perfect rhymes, at least in some dialects. Sowths, souths rhyme with mouth&apos;s. (Southed but not sowthed is also pronounced, which rhymes with mouthed.) sixth, -s twelfth, -s whilst wolf, -s, -ed wolve, -s, -d pork [ ˈ-ɔərk ] has no rhymes in conservative RP. However, the distinction between four and for has been lost in younger generations, and for them pork rhymes with fork etc. ( [ ˈ-ɔrk ] ). Nonce word s ending in -ed (&apos;provided with&apos;) may produce other potentially refractory masculine rhymes. { Some promising words are befezzed (wearing a } { fez ) and bemusicked, though the first rhymes with } { Yezd. } There are additional words which are only partially assimilated into English, such as Russian kovsh [ /ˈkɒvʃ/ ], which are refractory rhymes. Although not meant as a complete list, there are some additional refractory rhymes in GA. Some of these are due to RP being a non-rhotic accent, and having merged rhymes formerly distinguished by [ /r/ ]. [ ˈ-aɪtθ(s) ] [ /ˈhaɪtθ/ ] [ /ˈhaɪθ/ ] [ ˈ-aɪərn ] [ ˈ-aɪ.ərn ] [ ˈ-ɑrsts ] [ ˈ-ɛərs ] heighth, -s Colloquial GA heighth is. In RP, highth rhymes with dryth (= drought), rithe, etc., but is obsolete. iron Two syllables,, for many speakers. In RP, this rhymes with lion, cyan, Zion, etc. karsts In RP, this rhymes with fasts. scarce In RP, it rhymes with stairs, which is not a homonym for stares as it is in GA. [ Feminine rhymes ] Once the stress shifts to the penultimate syllable, rhymeless words are quite common, perhaps even the norm: there may be more rhymeless words than words with rhymes.
