[ Beginning of career ] Howard Carter was born in London, England, the son of Samuel Carter, an artist and Martha Joyce (Sands) Carter. His father trained and developed his artistic talent. Much of Carter&apos;s childhood was spent in the Norfolk market town of Swaffham (probably due to ill-health). { Swaffham museum Retrieved 20 May 2012 } In 1891 Carter was sent out by the Egypt Exploration Fund to assist Percy Newberry in the excavation and recording of Middle Kingdom tombs at Beni Hasan. Although only 17 years old he was innovative in improving the methods of copying tomb decoration. In 1892 he worked under the tutelage of Flinders Petrie for one season at Amarna, the capital founded by the pharaoh Akhenaten. From 1894 to 1899 he then worked with Édouard Naville at Deir el-Bahari, where he recorded the wall reliefs in the temple of Hatshepsut. In 1899, Carter was appointed the first chief inspector of the Egyptian Antiquities Service (EAS). He supervised a number of excavations at Thebes (now known as Luxor) before he was transferred in 1904 to the Inspectorate of Lower Egypt. Carter resigned from the Antiquities Service in 1905 after an enquiry into an affray (known as the Saqqara Affair) between Egyptian site guards and a group of French tourists in which he sided with the Egyptian personnel. { James, T.

After several years of fruitless searching, Carnarvon became dissatisfied with the lack of results and, in 1922, he gave Carter one more season of funding to find the tomb he was searching for. [ Fiona Carnarvon Highclere Castle Highclere Enterprises 2011 59 ] On 4 November 1922, Howard Carter&apos;s excavation group found the steps leading to Tutankhamun &apos;s tomb (subsequently designated KV62 ), by far the best preserved and most intact pharaonic tomb ever found in the Valley of the Kings. He wired Carnarvon to come, and on 26 November 1922, with Carnarvon, Carnarvon&apos;s daughter, and others in attendance, Carter made the &quot; tiny breach in the top left hand corner &quot; of the doorway, and was able to peer in by the light of a candle and see that many of the gold and ebony treasures were still in place. He made the breach into the tomb with a chisel his grandmother had given him for his seventeenth birthday. He did not yet know at that point whether it was &quot; a tomb or merely a cache &quot;, but he did see a promising sealed doorway between two sentinel statues. When Carnarvon asked &quot; can you see anything? &quot;, Carter replied with the famous words: &quot; Yes, wonderful things. &quot; { Lord Carnarvon&apos;s description, 10 December 1922, quoted in: } [ Reeves Nicholas Taylor John H. Howard Carter before Tutankhamun London British Museum 1992 0-7141-0952-5 141 ] { Theban Necropolis } The next several months were spent cataloging the contents of the antechamber under the &quot; often stressful &quot; oversight of Pierre Lacau, director general of the Department of Antiquities of Egypt. { Wikipedia - French edition } On 16 February 1923, Carter opened the sealed doorway, and found that it did indeed lead to a burial chamber, and he got his first glimpse of the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun. All of these discoveries were eagerly covered by the world&apos;s press, but most of their representatives were kept in their hotels; only H. V. Morton was allowed on the scene, and his vivid descriptions helped to cement Carter&apos;s reputation with the British public. Carter&apos;s own notes and photographic evidence, indicate that he, Lord Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn Herbert entered the burial chamber shortly after the tomb&apos;s discovery and before the official opening.

Following his sensational discovery, Howard Carter retired from archaeology and became a part-time agent for collectors and museums, including the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Detroit Institute of Arts. He visited the United States in 1924, and gave a series of illustrated lectures in New York City and other cities in the United States that were attended by very large and enthusiastic audiences, sparking Egyptomania in America. He died of lymphoma, a type of cancer, in Kensington, London, on 2 March 1939 at the age of 64.
