[ April 2008 ] [ Skandia 220px Old Mutual www.skandia.com ] Skandia is one of the world&apos;s leading independent providers of solutions for long-term savings and investments. They offer products and services that cater for various financial needs and security. Skandia pioneered the &quot; MultiManager &quot; approach, which has now been adopted by most life insurance providers. [ History ] Skandia started out as a Swedish insurance company in 1855. Today the brand operates in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Skandia also operates an internet bank called Skandiabanken in the Nordic region. In 2003 the operations in North America, American Skandia, was acquired by Prudential Financial. The CEO of American Skandia, Wade Dokken partnered with Goldman Sachs and sold the division to Prudential Financial for $1.2 billion. [ Wade Dokken: Bibliography http://wade-dokken.com/biography/ 25 February 2011 ] In 2005 South African/British financial services group Old Mutual launched a $6.5bn (£3.6bn) bid to acquire majority control of Skandia, which was met with resistance from some of Skandia&apos;s shareholders and directors. On February 3, 2006 Old Mutual completed its acquisition of Skandia, which was subsequently delisted from the Stockholm and London stock exchanges. { http://news.bbc.co.uk } Skandia&apos;s largest operation, in terms of new business and profit, is the United Kingdom which launched in 1979. Their UK headquarters is Skandia House in Southampton. Peter Mann became the current Chief Executive Officer for the UK and Offshore Group on May 1, 2010. { http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/peter-mann-to-become-skandia-uk-chief-executive/1010805.article } { http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/district/southampton/8127580.New_boss_for_2_000_staff_after_surprise_resignation/ } Mann replaced former CEO Nick Poyntz-Wright who&apos;d been with the company for 21 years.

The company announced that it would take 18 months for the rebranding to complete, with the UK and offshore division being first. The old logo was replaced with a new one to be more in-line with Old Mutual&apos;s colours. [ Criticisms ] Controversy surrounded Skandia in the mid-noughties, mostly due to illegal internal affairs with the Swedish Skandia Life, and for having provided executives with subsidized apartments in Stockholm. The involved executives are among others Lars-Eric Petersson and Ulf Spång. The Skandia trademark and reputation were tainted in Sweden during this time. It was discovered in late 2003 that executives at Skandia had embezzled 13 billion Swedish kronor. Subsequently, the board had to resign and in 2006. Lars-Eric Petersson was sentenced to two years in prison. However, the case was later appealed to a higher court. On 19 December 2007, the Court of Appeal dismissed all charges against Lars-Eric Petersson. The charges by the prosecutor proceeded from the prerequisite that the payments from Skandia’s bonus program, called Wealthbuilder, to the beneficiaries were limited to an amount of SEK 300 million during the time period 1 January 1998 – 31 December 1999. According to the prosecutor, Lars-Eric Petersson had, without the consent of the Board, removed the cap on the bonus programme by signing a document named Appendix 3, and thus causing payments of additionally approx. SEK 156 million to the beneficiaries. On 26 March 2010, the former legal head of Skandia Germany, Michael Wolski, was prosecuted for tax fraud of the Cezanowski family (about EUR 50 million which Michael Wolski cashed in) for 2 years and 6 months jail in Darmstadt, Germany. His wife Karin Wolski, who is a high court judge, resigned on the same day. His wife is driving among others a Bugatti Veyron, which was bought from the &quot; stolen &quot; money. According to the Court of Appeal, the prosecutor was not able to prove that the limitation for Wealthbuilder was still in force when Lars-Eric Petersson signed Appendix 3 in December 2000. The charges were therefore dismissed.
