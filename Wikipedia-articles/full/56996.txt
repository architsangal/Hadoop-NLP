It also stars Joanna Lumley and Julia Sawalha, along with June Whitfield and Jane Horrocks. The series features Saunders as Edina Monsoon, a heavy-drinking, drug-abusing PR agent who spends her time chasing bizarre fads in a desperate attempt to stay young and &quot; hip. &quot; Edina is joined in her quest by magazine editor Patsy Stone, her best friend and enabler, whose drug abuse, alcohol consumption, and promiscuity far eclipse Edina&apos;s comparatively mild self-destructive behaviour. Despite being a middle-aged, twice-divorced career woman, Edina is reliant upon the support of her daughter, Saffron, a secondary school pupil (and later university student) whose constant care for her mother has left her a bitter cynic. [ Production ] The show has had an extended and sporadic run. Series one, two, and three aired on the BBC from 1992 to 1995, followed by a series finale in the form of a two-part television movie entitled The Last Shout in 1996. Creator Jennifer Saunders revived the show as a fourth series in 2001 after having written and submitted a pilot to the BBC entitled Mirrorball, which recruited nearly all of the original &quot; Absolutely Fabulous &quot; cast in new roles. The pilot was intended to be turned into a series of episodes. However, Saunders felt the &quot; Absolutely Fabulous &quot; characters were far too rich and interesting to put aside, and were far better suited for her new story ideas. Instead of Mirrorball, a new series of Absolutely Fabulous was proposed to the BBC, who later commissioned the fourth series in 2001. From 2001 to 2004, two full series were produced, along with three one-off hour-long specials; Gay (retitled and issued as Absolutely Fabulous in New York for the United States) in 2002, Cold Turkey, a Christmas special in 2003, and White Box (which included the tying-up of loose-ends and past semi-regular characters appearing in cameos in what seemed an ironic finale for Saffy, Patsy, and Edina), which aired in 2004. A Comic Relief sketch broadcast in 2005. In August 2011, Lumley confirmed the planned filming of three new episodes.

The third, and final special is set to coincide with the 2012 London Olympics. A film version of the series is planned. { &quot; Jennifer Saunders &apos;definitely doing&apos; Absolutely Fabulous movie &quot; 29 December 2011, Digital Spy } In the U.S., the first of the 3 new 20th anniversary specials aired in January 2012 for broadcast by both BBC America and Logo Channel. Both channels also co-produced the 20th Anniversary episodes, although Logo has removed some scenes for its airings. BBC America appears not to have removed any scenes. Both channels aired the episode in a 40 minute block to allow for commercial interruptions. Absolutely Fabulous is ranked as the 17th greatest British TV show of all time by the British Film Institute. A scene from the show was included in the 100 Greatest TV Moments programme broadcast by Channel 4. In 1997, the pilot episode, &quot; Fashion &quot;, was ranked number 47 on TV Guide&apos;s &quot; 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time &quot; list. [ 1997 Special Collectors&apos; Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time TV Guide 28 June-4 July 8 October 2011 ] In 2004 and 2007, the series was ranked number 24 and number 29 on TV Guide &apos;s Top Cult Shows Ever list. [ http://www.tvguide.com/news/top-cult-shows-40239.aspx TV Guide Names the Top Cult Shows Ever 29 June 2007 TVGuide.com 10 October 2011 ] [ Background ] Absolutely Fabulous grew from a French &amp; Saunders sketch called &quot; Modern Mother and Daughter &quot; (from series 3 episode 6), which starred Jennifer Saunders as the mother (named &apos;Adrianna&apos;) and Dawn French as the daughter, already named Saffron. The sketch revolved around a middle-aged, single mother who acted like a teenager, and was reliant upon the emotional and financial support of her teenage daughter, who behaved like a middle-aged woman. It has no connection, other than the character&apos;s name, to the earlier film Eddie Monsoon: A Life?, a comedy play written by Saunders&apos; husband Adrian Edmondson in 1984 for the TV series The Comic Strip Presents.... The name, &quot; Edina Monsoon &quot;, is derived from Edmondson&apos;s name and &quot; Eddy Monsoon &quot; is a nickname of his. According to an article published in The Times, the character of Edina was based on Lynne Franks. [ Gillian Bowditch 3 August 2008 My mad, mad Ab Fab life The Times http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4449541.ece 12 September 2011 ] Franks believed Saunders had observed her and her children in detail after joining them on a family holiday. Josh Howie, Franks&apos; son, reported that his mother was upset because one of her best friends &quot; had taken the piss out of her &quot; in a TV show. Although Ab Fab was produced by Saunders and French&apos;s production company, Dawn French only appeared on the show once, in a cameo in the first-series episode &quot; Magazine &quot;. Three new specials were announced to celebrate the show&apos;s 20th anniversary with the first special &apos;Surprising guests&apos; airing on 25 December 2011. Jon Plowman, executive producer and original producer of the Absolutely Fabulous series, said: &quot; Viewers have been fantastically loyal in their devotion to our show, so we&apos;re really thrilled to say that it&apos;s coming back for three new shows to celebrate our 20th anniversary. All of the originals who are back together again are still truly absolutely fabulous and the new adventures of Edina, Patsy, Saffy, Bubble and Mother, plus a few surprising guests, will be a real treat for viewers. &quot; Jennifer Saunders announced in November 2011 that she has begun work on a film version of the series.

The two women use their considerable financial resources to indulge in a life revolving around alcohol, recreational drugs, and chasing the latest fads in an attempt to maintain their youth and recapture their glory days as mods in Swinging London. The partnership is largely driven by Patsy, who functions as both codependent and enabler to Eddy. Their lifestyle inevitably leads to a variety of personal crises, which are invariably taken care of by Eddy&apos;s young daughter, Saffron, whose constant abuse at the hands of Eddy and Patsy has left her a bitter, cynical teenager (and later twenty-something) who nonetheless continues to care for her mother out of a sense of unconditional love.

However, the following year in November 1996, two specials called &quot; The Last Shout &quot; were broadcast and were also billed as the last ever episodes. Both &apos;last episodes&apos; featured end sequences with flashes to the future. However, after writing Mirrorball, Jennifer Saunders decided she had more ideas, [ Radio Times Guide to TV Comedy BBC Worldwide Ltd 2003 ] leading to a fourth series, which premiered on 31 August 2001. A fifth series and three specials followed, the last of which aired on 11 March 2005. This was followed by a short special for Comic Relief. In July 2005, Saunders announced she would not be writing or playing Edina again, stating &quot; The 6am calls to go to make-up and all the promotional work wear you down. I would like to write and direct—that would be my joy &quot;. However, in November 2010, Lumley revealed to Playbill Magazine that she had recently spoken to Saunders about the possibility of filming a new series. Both Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Saunders reunited for the M &amp; S Christmas advert in 2009 along with other stars such as Twiggy and Stephen Fry. Lumley narrates the advert starting with &quot; Christmas wouldn&apos;t be Christmas without... &quot; During their spot Saunders says &quot; Stuffing &quot; to which Lumley replies in the style of Patsy &quot; Your Face! &quot; before adding &quot; Sweetie &quot; one of the show&apos;s catchphrases. On 29 August 2011, it was announced that a further series of three programmes are being made to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original production. The first of these, &quot; Identity &quot;, was shown on Christmas Day 2011 and the second, &quot; Job &quot;, was shown on New Year&apos;s Day 2012.
