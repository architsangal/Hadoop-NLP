[ March 2012 ] [ March 2012 ] { Worldcon 2005 in } { Glasgow } Paul J. McAuley (born 23 April 1955), a British botanist and award-winning author. A biologist by training, UK science fiction author McAuley writes mostly hard science fiction, dealing with themes such as biotechnology, alternate history /alternate reality, and space travel. McAuley began with far-future space opera Four Hundred Billion Stars, its sequel Eternal Light, and the planetary-colony adventure Of the Fall. Red Dust, set on a far-future Mars colonized by the Chinese, is a planetary romance filled with all the latest SF ideas: nanotechnology, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, personality downloads, virtual reality. The Confluence trilogy, set in an even more distant future (about ten million years from now), is one of a number of novels to use Frank J. Tipler &apos;s Omega Point Theory (that the universe seems to be evolving toward a maximum degree of complexity and consciousness) as one of its themes. [ March 2011 ] About the same time, he published Pasquale&apos;s Angel, set in an alternate Italian Renaissance and featuring Niccolò Machiavegli ( Machiavelli ) and Leonardo da Vinci as major characters. McAuley has also used biotechnology and nanotechnology themes in near-future settings: Fairyland describes a dystopian, war-torn Europe where genetically engineered &quot; dolls &quot; are used as disposable slaves. Since 2001 he has produced several SF-based techno-thriller s such as The Secret of Life, Whole Wide World, and White Devils. Four Hundred Billion Stars, his first novel, won the Philip K. Dick Award in 1988. [ http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year%3D1988 1988 Award Winners &amp; Nominees Worlds Without End 2009-05-16 ] Fairyland won the 1996 Arthur C.
