[ Psychology December 2008 March 2009 June 2011 ] Child sexuality is the sexual feelings, behaviors, and development of child ren. [ Freud ] Until Sigmund Freud published his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in 1905, children were often regarded as asexual, having no sexuality until later development. Freud was one of the first researchers to seriously study child sexuality. While his ideas, such as psycho-sexual development and the Oedipus complex, have been rejected, acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was a significant change. [ November 2011 ] Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions  — they wonder where babies come from, they notice anatomical differences between males and females, and many engage in genital play or masturbation. Child sex play includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends. { Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4thed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. } Sex play with others usually decreases as children go through their elementary school years, yet they still may possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, escalating in puberty (roughly the teenage years) when the main surge in sexual interest occurs. [ Child sexualization ] Some cultural critic s have postulated that over recent decades children have been subject to a premature sexualization, as indicated by a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.

APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls. } [ Research ] [ Early research ] Sigmund Freud in his 1905 work Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality outlined a theory of psycho-sexual development with five distinct phases: the oral stage (0 –1.5 years), the anal stage (1.5 –3.5 years), the phallic stage (3.5 –6 years) which culminates in the resolution of the Oedipus conflict, The Latency Phase (6–12 years of age), and the genital (or adult) stage. Alfred Kinsey in the Kinsey Reports (1948 and 1953) included research on the physical sexual response of children, including pre-pubescent children (though the main focus of the reports was adults). It has been stated that some of the data in his reports could not have been obtained without observation or participation in child sexual abuse, or through collaborations with child molesters. [ Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims: A Practical Guide Salter, Ph.D. Anna C. 1988 22–24 Sage Publications Inc 0-8039-3182-4 ] In 2000, Swedish researcher IngBeth Larsson noted, &quot; It is quite common for references still to cite Alfred Kinsey &quot;, due to the paucity of subsequent large-scale studies of child sexual behavior. { Larsson, IngBeth.

[ Behavior ] [ Normative and non-normative behaviors ] Although there are variations between individual children, children generally are curious about their bodies and those of others, and explore their bodies through explorative sex play. { SEX PLAY: parenting strategies by Dr. Marilyn Heins } { PPP: Health and Safety || When Children&apos;s Play Involves Sexuality || Sex play is normal } Playing doctor is one example of such childhood exploration. Such games are generally considered to be normal in young children and not sexual in nature. Child sexuality is considered fundamentally different from adult sexual behavior, which is more goal-driven. Among children, genital penetration and oral-genital contact are very uncommon, [ Friedrich WN, Fisher J, Broughton D, Houston M, Shafran CR Normative sexual behavior in children: a contemporary sample Pediatrics 101 4 E9 1998 9521975 10.1542/peds.101.4.e9 ] and may be perceived as imitations of adult behaviors. { Larsson &amp; Svedin, 1999, op. cit.; Larsson &amp; Svedin, publication data unavailable; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit. } Such behaviors are more common among children who have been sexually abused. A 1997 study based on limited variables found no correlation between early childhood (age 6 and under) peer sexual play and later adjustment. [ 10.1080/00224499709551902 Okami Paul Olmstead Richard Abramson Paul R. 1997 Sexual experiences in early childhood: 18-year longitudinal data from the UCLA family lifestyles project - University of California, Los Angeles http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_n4_v34/ai_20536042/pg_1 Journal of Sex Research 34 4 339–347 ] The study notes that its results do not demonstrate conclusively that no such correlates exist. The study also does not address the question of consequences of intense sexual experiences or aggressive or unwanted experiences. { (Okami, p. 9) } [ Symptomatic behaviors ] Children who have been the victim of child sexual abuse sometimes display overly sexualized behavior, { (Friedrich et al., 1992, 1993, op. cit.; Kendall-Tackett, K. E., Williams, L., Finkelhor, D. (1993). &quot; The impact of sexual abuse on children: A review and synthesis of recent empirical studies &quot;. Psychological Bulletin, 113:164 – 180.; Cosentino, C.

(1992), op. cit.; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit. } which may be defined as expressed behavior that is non-normative for the culture. Typical symptomatic behaviors may include excessive or public masturbation and coercing, manipulating or tricking other children into non-consensual or unwanted sexual activities, also referred to as &quot; child-on-child sexual abuse &quot;. Sexualized behavior is thought to constitute the best indication that a child has been sexually abused. Children who exhibit sexualized behavior may also have other behavioral problems. Other symptoms of child sexual abuse may include manifestations of post-traumatic stress in younger children; fear, aggression, and nightmares in young school-age children; and depression in older children. [ Normative behavior ] [ December 2010 ] The following sections describe typical culturally-normed behavior among developed Western societies. [ Early childhood ] From the ages of three to seven, the following behaviors are normal among children: Children are curious about where babies come from. GH6002 Sexuality and Your Child: For Children Ages 3 to 7, MU Extension Children may explore other children&apos;s and adults&apos; bodies out of curiosity. By age four, children may show significant attachment to the opposite-sex parent. Children begin to have a sense of learned modesty and of the differences between private and public behaviors. For some children, genital touching increases, especially when they are tired or upset. [ Early school age ] Early school age covers approximately ages five to seven. Children become more aware of gender differences, and tend to choose same-sex friends and playmates, even disparaging the opposite sex. { Sex education: Talking to toddlers and preschoolers about sex - MayoClinic.com } Children may drop their close attachment to their opposite-sex parent and become more attached to their same-sex parent. During this time, children, especially girls, show increased awareness of social norms regarding sex, nudity, and privacy. { Richardson, Justin, M.D., and Schuster, Mark, M.D., Ph.D. Everything You Never Wanted Your Kids to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid They&apos;d Ask), 2003, Three Rivers Press } Children may use sexual terms to test adult reaction. &quot; Bathroom humor &quot; (jokes and conversation relating to excretory functions), present in earlier stages, continues. { Planned Parenthood - Sexuality Development } Masturbation continues to be common. [ Middle childhood ] &quot; Middle childhood &quot; covers the ages from about six to eleven, depending on the methodology and the behavior being studied, individual development varies considerably. As this stage progresses, the choices of children picking same-sex friends becomes more marked and extending to disparagement of the opposite sex. { Adolescent and child sexuality } [ Sex play among siblings ] In 1980, a survey of 796 undergraduates, 15 percent of females and 10 percent of males reported some form of sexual experience involving a sibling; most of these fell short of actual intercourse. Approximately one quarter of these experiences were described as abusive or exploitative. { Finkelhor, David. Ph.D. Sex Among Siblings: A Survey on Prevalence, Variety and Effects. Archives of Sexual Behavior. Volume 9, Number 3 / June, 1980. p. 171-194. } A 1989 paper reported the results of a questionnaire with responses from 526 undergraduate college students in which 17 percent of the respondents stated that they had preadolescent sexual experiences with a sibling. { SpringerLink - Journal Article } [ In other cultures ] The following section describes behaviors observed outside of Western societies. [ Papua New Guinea ] At seven or eight years of age, children of the Trobriand Islands begin to play erotic games with each other and imitate adult seductive attitudes. About four or five years later, they begin to pursue sexual partners in earnest. They change partners often. Women are just as assertive and dominant as men in pursuing or refusing a lover. { Weiner, Annette B. The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea. United States of America: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 1988. } This is not only allowed but encouraged.
