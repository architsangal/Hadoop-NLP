Brooks was a nephew of U.S. Senator John Holmes Overton and a great-grandson of Walter Hampden Overton. At the time of his death, he was chairman of the House Science and Astronautics Committee. [ Before politics ] Brooks was born in Baton Rouge to Claude M. Brooks and the former Penelope Overton. He graduated from public schools. Brooks served overseas during World War I as an enlisted man in the Sixth Field Artillery, First Division, Regular Army, 1918-1919. After the war, he obtained a law degree in 1923 from Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. He was then admitted to the bar and began his practice in Shreveport, the seat of Caddo Parish. On June 1, 1932, Brooks married the former Mollie Meriwether of Shreveport, a daughter of Minor Meriwether and the former Anne Finley McNutt. They had one child, Laura Anne. [ Political career ] Brooks succeeded John Nicholas Sandlin, Sr., a fellow Democrat from Minden, the seat of Webster Parish. Rather than seek reelection to the House, Sandlin ran unsuccessfully in the 1936 Democratic primary against Allen J. Ellender for an open seat in the U.S. Senate. In 1940, newly elected Governor Sam Houston Jones urged that Brooks be defeated in the Democratic congressional primary, but Brooks won his third term that year. { &quot; Hot Election Forecast for Louisiana Democratic Primary &quot;, } { St. Petersburg Times, } { St. Petersburg, Florida, September 9, 1940 } In 1950, Brooks overwhelmed { Minden Herald, July 28, 1950, p. 1 } the conservative intraparty challenge waged by James H. Greene (1918–1988), [ http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi Social Security Death Index ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com May 12, 2011 ] a 32-year-old graduate of Fair Park High School, a veteran of the U.S. Navy, and at the time a reporter for the since defunct Shreveport Journal. { &quot; James Greene Enters Race for Congress, &quot; Minden Herald, June 2, 1950, p. 12 } In 1952, Brooks defeated another young conservative intraparty rival, attorney Lawrence L. May, Jr. (1921–1995), of Vivian in Caddo Parish, who in an advertisement criticized the mounting casualties of the Korean War and the excesses of federal bureaucracy. May declared himself &quot; an anti- Truman, anti- New Deal, anti-communist Demorat. &quot; { Minden Press, June 13, 1952, p. 12 } Brooks served on the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services from 1947 to 1958, and he then became the first chairman of the newly formed House Space Committee (later Science and Astronautics), reportedly because his seniority entitled him to a more important post on Armed Services than he was considered capable of handling. He was reappointed in 1961. Although little can be credited to his chairmanship, he was noted for having urged the development of a civil, rather than military, space program. On May 4, 1961, his committee sent a memo to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson on this subject. ( President John F. Kennedy&apos;s speech which prompted the Apollo program came just a few weeks later.) From his Armed Services Committee berth, Brooks became a champion of veterans&apos; causes. The veterans&apos; medical center in Shreveport bears his name. He was also president of the National River and Harbor Congress and was an early advocate of making the Red River navigable from Shreveport to Alexandria, a cause continued by his popular Democratic successor, Joseph David &quot; Joe D. &quot; Waggonner, Jr., of Plain Dealing in northern Bossier Parish. Brooks was reelected to Congress twelve times. He signed the Southern Manifesto, a failed congressional attempt to block desegregation of public schools. In 1956, he campaigned on issues popular with many of his constituents, including continued support for segregation. For a time the segregationist publisher Ned Touchstone of Bossier City worked on Brooks&apos; staff. Brooks also urged the strengthening national defense, the expanded production of natural gas, rural electrification, and &quot; fair prices &quot; for farm, dairy, and ranch products. { Minden Herald, July 26, 1956, p. 2 } In November 1956, Brooks defeated by a 68-32 percent margin the Republican nominee Littleberry Calhoun Allen, Jr., who later turned Democratic and was elected as Shreveport&apos;s public utilities commissioner (1962–1970) and as mayor (1970–1978). Brooks declared himself a lifelong Democrat in that campaign and urged voters to support Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois for president over the Louisiana choice that year, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Allen, at the time, had termed himself an &quot; Eisenhower Republican &quot;. In Brooks&apos; last election in 1960, he overwhelmed, 74-26 percent, the Republican challenger, Fred C. McClanahan, Jr. (1918–2007), an insurance agent from Shreveport. [ Vote on Rules Committee ] On January 31, 1961, Brooks voted with a narrow majority of 217-212 to increase the size of the House Rules Committee to permit Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas to appoint newer, more liberal members to the panel which determined which legislation goes to the House floor. Conservative s in both parties generally opposed this vote, which they termed &quot; packing the Rules Committee. &quot; Waggonner later announced that he would challenge Brooks in the August 1962 Democratic primary. A civic group known as the Congressional Affairs League of Louisiana was formed to express a vote of &quot; no confidence &quot; in Brooks. Among the organizers of the League were Charles E. Roemer, Jr., of Bossier Parish, later the commissioner of administration under Governor Edwin Washington Edwards and the father of Governor Buddy Roemer. From Webster Parish, the organizers included building contractor John L. McInnis (1915–1994) and R. McIntyre Bridges (1926–1992), a physician who served on the parish school board as a conservative Democrat. { Minden Herald, } { Minden, } { Louisiana, February 16, 1961, p. 13 } Opposition to Brooks&apos; vote to expand the Rules Committee led to the burning of a cross on the congressman&apos;s lawn at his Linden Street home in Shreveport. Caddo Parish Sheriff J. Howell Flournoy advised Brooks to remain in Washington and not come home until tensions eased. [ Death ] Brooks later died of a heart attack in Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. Former Shreveport Mayor James C. Gardner of Shreveport, who at the time lived only two blocks from Brooks, said in his memoirs that he believes Brooks&apos; death was &quot; largely a result of the strain that he experienced from the Rules Committee vote. The party had demanded a vote that had a large and vocal opposition among the congressman&apos;s constituents. &quot; Brooks&apos; death propelled Waggonner into the special election to choose a new representative. After winning an easy closed Democratic primary race, Waggonner faced a stronger-than-usual Republican challenger in Charlton Havard Lyons, Sr. (1894–1973), a Shreveport oilman originally from Vermilion Parish in south Louisiana. Waggonner nevertheless prevailed with 54 percent of the vote, having carried every parish in the district except Lyons&apos; Caddo Parish. Brooks was a member of the Masonic Lodge, the Shriners, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Kiwanis International. Brooks is interred at Forest Park Cemetery in Shreveport, the final resting place of many Shreveport politician s. He was Episcopalian.
