SimCity 2000 was first released by Maxis in 1993 for computers running Apple Macintosh Operating System. It was later released on the Amiga, DOS &amp; Microsoft Windows, followed by a release for OS/2. { http://www.os2ezine.com/v1n7/sc2000.html } In 1995, SimCity 2000 won &quot; Best Military or Strategy Computer Game &quot; Origins Award. [ Overview ] Screenshot of a typical city during an intermediate stage of a game in &apos;&apos;SimCity 2000&apos;&apos; The unexpected and enduring success of the original SimCity, combined with the relative lack of success with other &quot; Sim &quot; titles, finally motivated the development of a sequel. SimCity 2000 was a major extension of the concept; the view was now dimetric instead of overhead, land could have different elevation s, and underground layers were introduced for water pipe s and subway s. New types of facilities include prison s, school s, libraries, museum s, marina s, hospitals and arcologies. Players can build highway s, road s, bus depot s, railway track s, subways, train depot s and zone land for seaport s and airports. There are a total of nine varieties of power plants in SimCity 2000, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, wind turbine s, hydroelectric dams (which can only be placed on waterfall tiles), solar and the futuristic fusion power and satellite microwave plant. Most types of power plants have a limited life span and must be rebuilt periodically. Players can build highways to neighboring cities to increase trade and the population. These neighboring cities are named after British Science-Fiction sitcom characters notably from Red Dwarf. { http://www.eeggs.com/tree/968.html } The budget and finance controls are also much more elaborate—tax rates can be set individually for residential, commercial and industrial zones. Enacting city ordinances and connecting to neighboring cities became possible. The budget controls are very important in running the city effectively. Another new addition in SimCity 2000 is the query tool. Using the query tool on tiles reveals information such as structure name and type, altitude, and land value. Certain tiles also display additional information; power plants, for example, display the percentage of power being consumed when queried, and querying roads displays the amount of traffic on that tile. Querying a library and selecting &quot; Ruminate &quot; displays an essay written by Neil Gaiman. Graphics were added for buildings under construction in the residential, commercial, and industrial zones, as well as darkened buildings depicting abandoned buildings as a result of urban decay. News comes in the form of several pre-written newspaper articles with variable names that could either be called up immediately or could be subscribed to on a yearly basis. The newspaper option provided many humorous stories as well as relevant ones, such as new technology, warnings about aging power plants, recent disaster s and opinion poll s (highlighting city problems). SimCity 2000 is the only game in the entire series to have this feature (besides the discontinued children&apos;s version, SimTown ), though newer versions have a news ticker. The newspapers had random titles (Times, Post, Herald, etc.), and prices based on the simulated year. Certain newspapers have a special monthly humor advice column by &quot; Miss Sim &quot;. Some headlines have no purpose whatsoever in the game, such as &quot; Bald Radio Found &quot; or &quot; Frog Convention &quot;. Though there is no &quot; true &quot; victory sequence in SimCity 2000, the &quot; exodus &quot; is a close parallel. An &quot; exodus &quot; occurs during the year 2051 or later, when 300 or more Launch Arcologies are constructed; the following January each one &quot; takes off &quot; into space so that their inhabitants can form new civilizations on distant worlds (although the visual representation of the scene consists of the Arcologies exploding in a manner similar to bulldozed buildings, one by one). [ http://www.sc3000.com/sc2000/info/showarticle.cfm?id%3D0016%26amp%3BopenItemID%3Dcid.16 Info &amp; Strategy – Arcologies in SimCity 2000 SC3000.COM 2006-07-18 ] This reduces the city&apos;s population to those who are not living in the Launch Arcologies, but it also opens wide areas for redevelopment and returns their construction cost to the city treasury. This is related to the event in SimEarth where all cities are moved into rocket-propelled dome s that then leave to &quot; found new worlds &quot; (leaving no sapient life behind). The game also included several playable scenarios, in which the player must deal with a disaster (in most, but not all scenarios) and rebuild the city to meet a set of victory conditions. These were based in versions of real-life cities, and some were based on real events such as the 1991 Oakland firestorm, the 1989 Hurricane Hugo in Charleston, South Carolina, or dealing with the 1970s economic recession in Flint, Michigan —but also included more fanciful ones such as a &quot; monster &quot; destroying Hollywood in 2001. More scenarios added with the SCURK included a nuclear meltdown in Manhattan in 2007. SimCity 2000 was the first Sim game to feature the semi-nonsensical phrase &quot; Reticulating Splines &quot;, which means to make a network of spline s. Will Wright has stated in an interview that the game does not actually reticulate splines when generating terrain, and he just inserted the phrase because it &quot; sounded cool &quot;. [ June 2007 ] The phrase has since been featured in SimCopter, SimCity 4, The Sims, The Sims 2, Spore, The Sims 3, and The Sims Social. It is also used in the web-based game Glitch, the popular video game Minecraft (as a title screen splash text), the music service Turntable.fm, the free online education site khanacademy.org, the photo-sharing site Flickr, and the Humble Indie Bundle Android app. [ Scenarios ] Charleston : Begins in August, 1989. The city is hit by a hurricane, a recreation of Hurricane Hugo. Dullsville: Begins in June, 1910. The citizens are bored and the objective is to make the town into a metropolis. Flint : Begins in August, 1974. The city has high unemployment, because of the mass exodus of industries. A recreation of the 1970s economic recession. Hollywood : Begins in January, 2001. The city is attacked by a giant robot. Oakland Hills : Begins in October, 1991. A recreation of the Oakland Firestorm of 1991. Davenport, Iowa : Begins in May, 1993. A recreation of the Great Flood of 1993. [ Scenarios Vol. I: Great Disasters ] In 1994, Maxis released a slew of expansions for the already popular SimCity 2000. One of these was a scenario package which include a number of disaster scenarios ranging from the fictitious (such as a UFO attack in future Atlanta, Georgia ) to real world disasters, such as Great Flood of 1993. This pack included: Atlanta : A UFO attack devastates Atlanta in December 2050, causing widespread panic and setting the city ablaze. Barcelona : Terrorists have planted a nuclear bomb beneath the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, where the 1992 Summer Olympics are going to be held. Right in the middle of the games, the bomb is detonated. The stadium and everyone inside are instantly vaporized and much of Barcelona is obliterated. Thousands are killed and the entire city is contaminated with radiation. Chicago : A major chemical spill routes the industrial sector of 1999 Chicago into an exodus of sorts, forcing the city to rebuild its corporate sector. Davenport : Massive amounts of rainfall instigate the flooding of the Mississippi River in 1993. This scenario recreates the Davenport incident. Homestead, Florida : A major hurricane, based on Hurricane Andrew, has devastated a 1992 Homestead. Fortunately, FEMA funds have finally arrived. Malibu : In the fall of 1993, Southern California was ravaged by terrible forest fires. This scenario recreates the infamous Malibu incident. Manhattan : Manhattan&apos;s efficient nuclear power station has a major meltdown in October 2007, sweeping the city with chemical fires and radiation. Oakland : In 1991, Oakland suffers a fire destroying some of the city and the player must rebuild it. This references to the Oakland Fire in 1991. Portland : A summer&apos;s day in 2001 Oregon is interrupted when a previously unknown wellspring of volcanic activity erupts right in downtown Portland, destroying a large portion of the city. San Francisco : In October 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake single-handedly demolished many areas of Santa Cruz. Of the areas affected, San Francisco also suffered extensive damaged, including many fires caused by erupting gas mains. This is a recreation of that particular disaster. Silicon Valley : The high-tech society of the 2010 Silicon valley is hit hard when its futuristic power source goes awry - microwave beams transferring solar energy from an orbital satellite miss their intended receiver and instead incinerate many businesses and people in the area. Washington, D.C. : A fictitious day in 1995 is beset with hordes of drunken lawyers causing riots and mayhem. [ SimCity Urban Renewal Kit ] Editing a building in the &apos;&apos;SimCity Urban Renewal Kit&apos;&apos;. Alongside the Great Disasters Scenarios package came the introduction of a separate toolset called the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit (SCURK for short). It enabled players to modify the images used in-game to represent various buildings in much the same manner as general image manipulation software. The player was able to create basic bitmap files of a standard size with a standard 256 color palette. The use of limited palette cycling, which permitted animation, was also possible. A number of pre-altered graphics packages were distributed, including some which replaced the reward buildings with images of various well known international buildings, such as the Eiffel Tower, but most buildings were made by fan-artists and shared on the Internet. Several SCURK designs influenced the designs of SimCity 3000 s original buildings. The SCURK is divided into three areas. Paint the Town – A graphics program fashioned to produce custom buildings for SimCity 2000. Pick and Copy – A tileset (building set) modifier, which allows users to produce new tilesets that display specific custom buildings. Place and Print – A sandbox-style city builder with fewer restrictions than SimCity 2000, which also enables users to print cities on paper. The SCURK was also bundled along with Streets of SimCity and SimCopter, as the Place and Print aspect of the program was especially useful for non-SimCity 2000 users who intended to build custom cities for either game. The cities made in SCURK can be saved and used for SimCity 2000. [ Ports and special editions ] SimCity 2000 has been released on a wide range of platforms and version since its debut in 1994, ranging from ports of personal computers and video game consoles, to special editions. [ SimCity 2000 Special Edition ] A re-packaged version of SimCity 2000, SimCity 2000 Special Edition, was released in 1995 for Microsoft Windows and DOS PCs, partly because the original SimCity 2000 in 1993 could not be run under Microsoft Windows, even in command prompt mode. In addition to containing All expansions, it also featured the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit, the Vol. 1 scenario pack, remade music, new cities selected by Maxis from a 1994 competition, bonus scenarios and cities, and movies. [ SimCity 2000 Special Edition http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/simcity_2000_special_edition Good Old Games ] The movies were a first for Maxis; SimCity 2000-SE was the first &quot; Sim &quot; game to feature &quot; real &quot; videos (compared to &quot; animated bitmaps &quot;, such as the winning screen in SimAnt ). These videos included the introduction movie and four commentary videos by Will Wright; the latter were accessed via the &quot; WillTV &quot; application that came with the game. [ SimCity 2000 Gold/Network Edition ] A Gold version of the game, SimCity 2000: Gold Edition was released in 1996 for Windows only. [ February 2011 ] SimCity 2000 Network Edition featured slightly different gameplay in network mode, where mayors may start with more money, but must buy land before building upon it. The Gold edition had the ability to share in-game resources and to compete or cooperate with other cities. If the user is on an appropriate network ( TCP or IPX ), then SimCity 2000 Gold Edition works in a similar way to SimCity Societies, giving the ability to Not use Zones while building cities. [ February 2009 ] This version also features a revamped user interface. Instead of a static toolbar, items are accessed via cascading menus from the right of the screen, resulting in more screen real-estate for SimCity itself, without sacrificing functionality. [ SimCity 2000 (Sega Saturn) ] The first console version of the game and one of the first titles for the American Sega Saturn. Released in fall of 1995. This version had several changes. The game has enhanced graphics for all buildings.The buildings will change at the year of 1950 and 2050. There are also 3D animations displayed for each building in the building query windows. The game play remains the same for the most part. Instead of the Braun Llama Dome, there is a Space Terminal which assist the launching of the Arco. The arco can be seen launching from the city along with a special animated video. There are several new animated videos. The opening sequence displays a scene of the Alien/Monster chasing a Launch Arco in space. [ SimCity 2000 (PlayStation) ] The PlayStation version of the game is based on the Saturn version, however with some features removed and others added. This version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe for both PSP and PS3 on November 20, 2008 and in North America on Aug 28, 2009. This version use the same graphics as the Saturn version, however the city doesn&apos;t evolve. The only additions are new scenarios from Great Disasters scenario pack, including one that involves a new volcano forming in Portland (destroying most of the city, and requiring the mayor to rebuild it). The Silicon Valley and Washington DC scenarios are on the disk but isn&apos;t used. The port also allows the player to tour their city from a car&apos;s perspective and has a full motion video intro. The graphics are identical to SimCopter. [ SimCity 2000 (Nintendo 64) ] A Japan -only release of SimCity 2000 for the Nintendo 64 in 1997, produced and published by Imagineer Co., Ltd. It featured some additional features, mainly minigames, a dating game, TV to replace the newspaper, horse races and monster breeding, among others, all of them in 3D. A few new &quot; natural &quot; disasters were also included, most of them being giant monster attacks (players were able to use their monster to fight against them). Even when these extras gave the game a lot more to do, many consider it lost the original feeling of the game, since the extras were intended to appeal specifically to the Japanese market. [ SimCity 64 (Nintendo 64DD) ] [ SimCity 64 ] Another Japan-only release, SimCity 64 was based on the SimCity 2000 game but was heavily customized for the Nintendo 64DD game system. The ability to view the city at night was added, pedestrian level free-roaming of a city, and individual road vehicles and pedestrians controlled by their own AI wandered the player&apos;s city. Cities in the game are also presented in much more advanced 3D graphics, making SimCity 64 the first true 3D SimCity game. { GameStats: Sim City 64 Cheats, Reviews, News } [ SimCity 2000 (Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom) ] This was actually one of the first console ports of SimCity 2000 to any home system. However, there were a lot of losses and differences from the original version of SimCity 2000. The scrolling screen takes much longer than normal to scroll, which was considered to be one of the reasons for the overall rarity of this particular port of the game. However, the in-game controls, while having big icons that would be later used in the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Game Boy Advance ports of the game, were actually considered to be far easier to use than the original controls for the PC version of the game. As the previous SimCity title, there was no SNES Mouse support for this game. Also, there were far more errors than the original PC version of the game when it came to the newspapers and their articles. The disasters of riots and volcanoes (as well as possibly a few other disasters) were removed from the game. The game had less songs to choose from than the original PC version but they were also considered to be surprisingly superior to the original version of SimCity 2000 on the PC. Finally, each city allows the player to choose a name for the mayor at the beginning instead of being forced to have the same name unless the game was reinstalled as in the PC version. Also, compared to the PC version, the SNES port omits the cheat codes, limits the city maps to six, has no difficulty setting and only includes five generic scenarios. Furthermore, there was only one newspaper for the whole city, no matter what size that the city is, and it will be always labeled as (insert the name of a city here) Newspaper. In addition, unlike the PC version of the game, the stock photographs were replaced with more Japanese anime/manga-like pictures in this port of the game. This is the only port of the game to feature such pictures. All team names, city names, and mayor names were limited to only 8 characters, whereas the PC version allows for up to 32 characters for a city name and a mayor name. There were, however, additional gifts: a bigger city hall at 1,000,000 population, a TV station at 2,000,000 population, and a rocket launching pad at 3,000,000 population. The player can also see an actual launch of a single launch arco when you achieve 5,000,000 population in the last scenario. [ SimCity 2000 (Game Boy Advance) ] Released by Zoo Digital in 2003, SimCity 2000 for the Game Boy Advance featured most of the same content as previous versions, but several features are omitted, such as launch arcos. There is no water system, but it is unknown whether this was to make it a better portable experience or because of technical limitations. [ Subsequent releases based on SimCity 2000 ] [ February 2009 ] [ http://www.gamespot.com/features/6131572/index.html?q%3DThe%20Greatest%20Easter%20Eggs%20In%20Gaming The Greatest Easter Eggs In Gaming GameSpot 2006-06-19 ] [ http://www.planetout.com/news/article-print.html?1996%2F12%2F06%2F2 Activist &quot; Easter Egg &quot; Gets Gay Programmer Fired PlanetOut 2006-06-19 http://web.archive.org/web/20030721134034/http%3A//www.planetout.com/news/article-print.html?1996%2F12%2F06%2F2 July 21, 2003 ] [ February 2009 ] SimHealth – Released in 1994, the game simulated President Bill Clinton &apos;s healthcare reform proposals for the US; designed for a niche audience at best, the simulation never achieved great popularity. It featured a user interface that resembled a city in SimCity 2000. SimCopter – An arcade helicopter flight simulator based on the cities of SimCity 2000, SimCopter was published in 1996. It had the capability of importing SimCity 2000 cities and allowing the user to pilot a helicopter around them and accomplish missions such as rescuing people or putting out a fire. SimCopter was perhaps best known for a rather notorious Easter egg which, if successfully triggered, depicted scantily clad men in a homosexually provocative state. Due to the uproar, this &quot; feature &quot; was patched over in a future release. Streets of SimCity – Published in 1997, Streets of SimCity was a racing game based on the SimCopter engine. In addition to racing, it also featured courier missions and vehicular combat. However, the fact that this game was incredibly processor-intensive prevented this game from being a commercial success.
