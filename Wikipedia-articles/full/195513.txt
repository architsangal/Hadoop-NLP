[ Leister ] [ the two-pronged variant bident ] { Poseidon &apos;s trident } A trident ( [ icon ˈ t r aɪ d ə n t ] ), also called a trishula or leister or gig, is a three- pronged spear. It is used for spear fishing and was also a military weapon. Tridents are featured widely in mythical, historical and modern culture. The major Hindu god, Shiva the Destroyer and the Greco-Roman sea god Poseidon or Neptune are classically depicted bearing a trident. Tridents can be distinguished from pitchfork s in that the latter is an agricultural tool with two to six tines (also called prongs) which are shaped in such a way that they can be used to lift and pitch (throw) loose material. [ Etymology ] The word &quot; trident &quot; comes from the French trident, which in turn comes from the Latin tridens or tridentis (in Lithuanian tridantis or trishula first meaning three teeth and the second meaning three spikes or pillars): tri &quot; three &quot; and dentes &quot; teeth &quot;. Several Indian languages use a similar word for &quot; trident &quot;, trishula (tri-three + shool-thorn), derived from Sanskrit, meaning &quot; triple spears &quot;. It is also very similar to the Sanskrit word &quot; Tri &quot; - ( त्रि - Three ) &quot; Dunt &quot; ( दंत - Tooth ). The Greek equivalent is τρίαινα, tríaina, from Proto-Greek *trianja, threefold, cognate with the Latin triens.The &quot; trident &quot; of Poseidon is his weapon. [ In Alphabets ] The Semitic letter Shin comes from the shape of the trident. The Greek letter Psi also resembles the trident. [ Biology ] A number of structures in the biological world are described as trident in appearance. Since at least the late 19th century the trident shape was applied to certain botanical shapes; for example, certain orchid flora were described as having trident-tipped lips in early botanical works. { John Lindley and Thomas Moore (1964) The Treasury of Botany: A Popular Dictionary of the Vegetable Kingdom with which is Incorporated a Glossary of Botanical Terms, Published by Longmans Green, pt.1 } Furthermore, in current botanical literature, certain bract s are stated to have a trident-shape (e.g. Douglas-fir ). { C. Michael Hogan (2008) &apos;&apos;Douglas-fir: Pseudotsuga menziesii&apos;&apos;, globalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Strõmberg ) } [ Uses ] [ Fishing ] Tridents for fishing usually have barbed tines which trap the speared fish firmly. In the Southern and Midwestern United States, gigging is used for harvesting suckers, bullfrog s, flounder, and many species of rough fish.

In Ancient Rome, in a parody of fishing, tridents were famously used by a type of gladiator called a retiarius or &quot; net fighter &quot;. The retiarius was traditionally pitted against a secutor, and cast a net to wrap his adversary and then used the trident to kill him. { Roland Auguet [1970] (1994). Cruelty and Civilization: The Roman Games. London: Routledge. ISBN 0-415-10452-1. } [ Symbolism/mythology ] Parallel to its fishing origins, the trident is associated with Poseidon, the god of the sea in Greek mythology, the Roman god Neptune, and Shiva, a Hindu God who holds a trident in his hand. In Greek myth, Poseidon used his trident to create water sources in Greece and the horse. Poseidon, as well as being god of the sea, was also known as the &quot; Earth Shaker &quot; because when he struck the earth in anger he caused mighty earthquakes and he used his trident to stir up tidal waves, tsunami s and sea storms. In Roman myth, Neptune also used a trident to create new bodies of water and cause earthquakes. A good example can be seen in Gian Bernini &apos;s Neptune and Triton. In religious Taoism, the trident represents the Taoist Trinity, the Three Pure Ones. In Taoist rituals, a trident bell is used to invite the presence of deities and summon spirits, as the trident signifies the highest authority of Heaven.
