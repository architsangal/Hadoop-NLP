The East India College was a college in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, England. It was founded in February 1806 as the training establishment for the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). At that time, the HEIC provided general and vocational education for young gentlemen of sixteen to eighteen years old, who were nominated by its directors to writerships (i.e. clerkships) in the overseas civil service. Its counterpart for the training of officers for the East India Company&apos;s Presidency armies was Addiscombe Military Academy. [ History ] Haileybury College today Charles Grant, Chairman of the British East India Company and Member of Parliament, was closely involved in the foundation of the college. It was temporarily located in Hertford Castle, then moved in 1809 to its purpose-built site at nearby Hertford Heath. Its architect, William Wilkins, also designed the National Gallery in London. In 1856 an open competitive examination replaced the system of appointment to the Indian Civil Service by patronage. In January 1858, in the wake of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British government took over the administration of India and the college closed. The site, just outside Hertford, was reopened in 1862 as Haileybury and Imperial Service College. Haileybury still runs, as an independent school, with hundreds of boarders. [ Administrators ] [ Principals ] The College had four principals; the first was Samuel Henley. { ODNB article by G. P. Moriarty, ‘Henley, Samuel (1740–1815)’, rev. John D.
