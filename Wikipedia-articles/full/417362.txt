Halloran, who had operated a private school in Exeter, England, had fled England in 1796 due to debt s and after being accused of immorality. Also, it had been claimed by Henry Hobhouse, under-secretary of state there, that his degrees (in Divinity ) were self-awarded; however, no authority saw fit to pursue the claim formally, nor was any sworn evidence ever presented to render this a just charge. In 1830 Sydney College was founded. Sir Francis Forbes, Chief Justice, became President of the College and laid the foundation stone of the present building in College Street on 26 January 1830. In 1835, Sydney College opened in this building with W.T. Cape as Head Master. In 1842 he resigned and was succeeded by T.H. Braim. In 1850 Sydney College was closed. In 1854, Sydney Grammar School (SGS) was incorporated by an Act of Parliament and acquired the land and building in College Street which had been temporarily occupied by the newly-founded University of Sydney in 1852. It was opened on 3 August 1857, specifically as a feeder school for the University. The preamble of the Sydney Grammar School Act 1854 states that: It is deemed expedient for the better advancement of religion and morality and the promotion of useful knowledge to establish in Sydney a public school for conferring on all classes and denominations of Her Majesty’s subjects resident in the Colony of New South Wales without any distinction whatsoever the advantages of a regular and liberal course of education.

It consisted of a single large room (now known as &quot; Big School &quot; ) with basement rooms beneath. Sydney College continued despite financial difficulties until 1853, when it was taken over by the fledgling University of Sydney until such time as the present Grose Farm site was ready for occupation. The site was then sold in 1856 to the Trustees of the newly incorporated Sydney Grammar School, which had been established and endowed with a building fund by Act of Parliament. Edmund Blacket was commissioned to design extensions to the south and north of the Hallen building (now the North and South Blacket rooms), which were completed in 1856 and 1857 respectively. The &quot; Big School &quot; building became central to the Colonial Architect, James Barnet &apos;s vision for the cultural focus of Sydney Town.

In 1876, the main building was extended to the east by Mansfield Brothers, and this extension was itself extended to the north and south in 1899 by John W Manson. The Science classrooms on Stanley Street were built in 1889-90.

[ January 2008 ] Sydney Grammar is located near the Sydney Central Business District. The campus is compact and consists of multi-storey buildings (of up to eight floors) in a concrete landscape setting. Sydney Grammar is situated on the eastern side of Sydney&apos;s Hyde Park, next to the Australian Museum, and extends from College Street to Yurong Street. The designs of the School&apos;s buildings illustrate many different architectural eras: &quot; Big School &quot; (dating from the early 19th century colonial era), the Blacket buildings (annexed onto either side of &quot; Big School &quot; and completed in the 1850s), the original Science building (1891), the Science laboratory block (1960s), the Palladium building (an example of 1970s Modernist architecture), the Stanley Street building and Alastair Mackerras Theatre (1980s), and the A. B. &apos;Banjo&apos; Paterson Library (1990s). Weigall, the School&apos;s sportsground (named after former Headmaster Albert Bythesea Weigall ), is located at Rushcutters Bay next to the Edgecliff Preparatory School and includes tennis court s, cricket nets and three fields for cricket, rugby and football. It is routinely used for Saturday sports matches, Physical Education and as a recreational area for Grammar&apos;s Edgecliff Preparatory School next door. There is also a large gym nasium at College Street and full rowing facilities at the School&apos;s boatshed at Gladesville. In May 2005, Headmaster John Vallance announced that the School would lead a consortium to purchase 30 Alma St Paddington, known as White City, from Tennis New South Wales, thus extending the Weigall grounds substantially.

On 14 June 2008 the new field now known as Weigall 4 was opened with a range of guests including Mr Frank Lowy, President of Football Federation Australia.

Notably the hall is unique as it has been built beneath the playground and is substantially subterranean as a result. Much of the naturally occurring Sydney sandstone has been left in place which adds to the aesthetic and acoustic value of the space. The hall was officially opened by the Headmaster on 18 August 2011 with a substantive celebratory concert featuring performances from a large number of Grammar boys past and present.
