The city recently bought an outdoor swimming pool. Lake George, formed by the damming of Deep River, is a meidum sized lake that winds its way through Hobart. Once a wild and pristine environment rich with native wildlife, non-native species such as the dozens of domesticated ducks and geese and Eurasian mute swans released here by people over the years, as well as artificially high amounts of food due to feedings have produced an environment that holds far more animals than the area could ever naturally sustain. At Festival Park, the one-hundred to two-hundred or so resident birds (which include virtually-flightless domesticated birds, swans, mallards and canada geese that cannot or do not migrate, and hybrids of all types) that live at the lake year round, as well as migrant canada geese and mallards, have stripped the shoreline and land of most vegetation, resulting in erosian, and have turned the shallow lake below the dam into little more than a muddy broth of bacteria. The waters, however, are very fertile and as a result one-hundred pound channel catfish have been caught at Festival park.
