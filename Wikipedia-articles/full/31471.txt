At the age of 13 she began playing at gay bar s and piano bar s, chaperoned by her father.

Following several phases of writing and recording, during which Amos has since asserted that the band lost their musical edge and direction due to interference from record executives, in July 1988, the Y Kant Tori Read &apos;s self-titled debut album was released.

[ Solo career ] Despite the disappointing reaction to Y Kant Tori Read, Amos still had to comply with her six-record contract with Atlantic Records, who in 1989 wanted a new record by March 1990. The initial recordings were declined by the label, which Amos felt was because the album had not been properly presented.

This album became her commercial and artistic breakthrough. Amos traveled to New Mexico with personal and professional partner Eric Rosse in 1993 to write and largely record her second solo record, Under the Pink. The album was received with mostly favorable reviews and sold enough copies to chart at #12 on the Billboard 200, a significantly higher position than the preceding album&apos;s position at #54 on the same chart.

The album was recorded in an Irish church, in Delgany, County Wicklow, with Amos taking advantage of the church recording setting to create an album ripe with baroque influences, lending it a darker sound and style. She added harpsichord, harmonium, and clavichord to her keyboard repertoire, and also included such anomalies as a gospel choir, bagpipe s, church bells, and drum programming. The album garnered mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising its intensity and uniqueness while others bemoaned its comparative impenetrability. Despite the album&apos;s erratic lyrical content and instrumentation, the latter of which kept it away from mainstream audiences, Boys for Pele is Amos&apos;s most successful simultaneous transatlantic release, reaching #2 on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Top 40 upon its release at the height of her fame.

The underlying themes of both albums deal with womanhood, and Amos&apos;s own miscarriages and marriage.

The album is Amos&apos;s first concept album, with artwork featuring Amos photographed in character of the women portrayed in each song. Amos would later reveal that a stimulus for the album was to end her contract with Atlantic without giving them new original songs; Amos felt that since 1998, the label had not been properly promoting her and had trapped her in a contract by refusing to sell her to another label.

The tour featured &quot; Tori&apos;s Piano Bar &quot;, where fans could nominate cover songs on Amos&apos;s website which she would then choose from to play in a special section of each show. One of the songs chosen was the Kylie Minogue hit &quot; Can&apos;t Get You Out of My Head &quot;, which Amos dedicated to her the day after Minogue&apos;s breast cancer was announced to the public. Other songs performed by Amos include The Doors &apos; &quot; People are Strange &quot;, Depeche Mode &apos;s &quot; Personal Jesus &quot;, Joni Mitchell &apos;s &quot; The Circle Game &quot;, Madonna &apos;s &quot; Live to Tell &quot; and &quot; Like a Prayer &quot;, Björk &apos;s &quot; Hyperballad &quot;, Led Zeppelin &apos;s &quot; When the Levee Breaks &quot; (which she debuted in Austin, Texas, just after the events of Hurricane Katrina), Kate Bush &apos;s &quot; And Dream of Sheep &quot; and Crowded House &apos;s &quot; Don&apos;t Dream It&apos;s Over &quot;, dedicating it to drummer Paul Hester who had died a week before.

The entire concert tour featured 93 concerts, and 27 full-length concerts of the North American tour were released as official bootlegs in the Legs and Boots series. Sinful Attraction Tour For her tenth tour, Amos returned to the trio format of her 2002 and 2003 tours with bassist Jon Evans and drummer Matt Chamberlain while expanding her lineup of keyboards by adding three M-Audio MIDI controllers to her ensemble of her piano, a Hammond B-3 organ, and a Yamaha S90 ES keyboard.
