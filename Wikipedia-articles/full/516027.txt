It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America. It is both the first video game in the &apos;&apos;Kirby&apos;&apos; series and the debut of the Kirby character. Kirby&apos;s Dream Land was designed by Masahiro Sakurai, then an employee of HAL Laboratory. Sakurai intended for Kirby&apos;s Dream Land to be a simple game that could be played by beginning gamers. As the inaugural Kirby title, Kirby&apos;s Dream Land created many conventions that would appear in later games in the series, including Kirby&apos;s basic moves. However, Kirby&apos;s trademark &quot; copy &quot; ability would not appear until Kirby&apos;s Adventure, released less than one year later. Kirby&apos;s Dream Land was re-released for the 3DS&apos;s Virtual Console service. [ Gameplay ] { boss named } { Whispy Woods. } The gluttonous King Dedede has stolen all of the food from the inhabitants of Dream Land for a midnight feast, so Kirby, a resident of Dream Land, goes to retrieve the food and stop Dedede. Kirby&apos;s Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games : Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles. [ Development ] A magazine scan of when Kirby was known as Popopo. Kirby&apos;s Dream Land was developed by Masahiro Sakurai of HAL Laboratory. Kirby was a dummy character that the developers used until they could define a more sophisticated image. The designers grew to like Kirby so much that they decided to keep him instead of using a more advanced character. He was originally named [ Popopo ポポポ ], and Kirby&apos;s Dream Land was titled [ Twinkle Popo ティンクル・ポポ ]. Eventually, he was renamed Kirby and the game was renamed Hoshi no Kirby (literally Kirby of the Stars). During the development of what was then referred to as Twinkle Popopo, Popopo/Kirby&apos;s colour had not been decided upon. Masahiro Sakurai wanted him to be pink, while Shigeru Miyamoto felt that he should be yellow. Eventually, Nintendo decided to make him pink. Although pink is still Kirby&apos;s main colour, later games have shown Kirby in a wide variety of colours, including yellow. When Hoshi no Kirby was first released in Japan, it featured Kirby in pinkscale. However, Nintendo of America designed the North American box art and advertisements with a white Kirby based on the game&apos;s grey-scale visuals. [ http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/info/kirby101/index2.htm Welcome to Kirby&apos;s Rainbow Resort! - Creation 2007-03-06 Gamespy.com ] The visuals are presented in two dimensions using pixel ated sprites and environments. They are in black and white, like all Game Boy video games. The grey-scale visuals caused confusion with the North American box art, resulting in Nintendo of America presenting Kirby as being white. However, playing this cartridge with a GameBoy Color or GameBoy Advance let the player choose between different basic color palettes (as possible with every other monochrome GameBoy-cartridge). The music was composed by Jun Ishikawa. He was the only composer for this game, [ http://www.mobygames.com/game/kirbys-dream-land Kirby&apos;s Dream Land for Game Boy - MobyGames 2007-06-24 MobyGames.com ] and has been a regular composer in the Kirby series.
