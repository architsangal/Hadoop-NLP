The club briefly rose as high as the second tier of English football, spending two seasons in the Second Division in the 1970s. At the end of the 2003–04 season the club lost their League status when they were relegated from the Third Division. They remained in the Conference National until the end of the 2011–12 season, when they were promoted back to the Football League following a 2–1 victory against Luton Town at Wembley Stadium in the 2012 Conference National play-off Final. York have enjoyed more success in cup competitions than in the league, with highlights including an FA Cup semi-final appearance in 1955. In the 1995–96 League Cup, York beat Manchester United 3–0 at Old Trafford; Manchester United went on to win the FA Premier League and FA Cup double that season. Also, in the FA Cup, they beat Arsenal in 1985, as well as holding Liverpool to a draw on two consecutive seasons in the mid 1980s. York made an appearance at Wembley Stadium in 1993, when they defeated Crewe Alexandra in the Third Division play-off Final. After defeats in the 2009 FA Trophy Final and the 2010 Conference National play-off Final, York finally recorded a victory at the new Wembley against Newport County in the 2012 FA Trophy Final.

Bootham Crescent was converted into a football ground; a main stand was built and a roof was erected above the Popular Stand. The ground opened on 31 August 1932. In March 1938, the ground&apos;s record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York City play Huddersfield Town.

At this point most of the ground was still uncovered. The stadium was fitted with floodlights in 1959, which were used for the first time in a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959. During the mid-1980s, £300,000 was spent on a series of improvements to the Bootham Crescent ground, which was funded by money generated during York&apos;s FA Cup run in the 1984–85 season, which included games against Arsenal and then Liverpool, including a replay at Liverpool in front of a crowd of 43,000.

The capacity of Bootham Crescent had at one time been 12,475, with 3,245 seats, but this was reduced in 1994 because of an increase to the family area of the Main stand due to popular demand, and alterations to enable the ground to comply with the recommendations made in the Taylor Report. It saw 326 seats replacing a standing area, reducing capacity. Stricter rules concerning the density of people standing resulting from the Taylor Report further reduced capacity. New floodlights were installed during the summer of 1995, costing £122,000. These floodlights are twice as bright as the original floodlights, and meet the requirements for Division One football. A drainage system was installed to improve the quality of the pitch during winter, costing several thousand pounds. A water tower was also installed in the late 1990s. York had planned a move to Huntington Stadium in 2003, but withdrew their application as they were given a loan of £2  million from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund, which secured the purchase of Bootham Crescent.
