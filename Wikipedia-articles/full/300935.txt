Various commercial grades are available. NaK is highly reactive with water and may catch fire when exposed to air, so must be handled with special precautions. Quantities as small as one gram can be a fire or explosion risk. [ Physical properties ] NaK containing 40% to 90% potassium by weight is liquid at room temperature. The eutectic mixture consists of 78% potassium and 22% sodium, is liquid from &amp; minus;12.6 to 785°C, and has a density of 866  kg/m³ at 21°C and 855  kg/m³ at 100°C, making it less dense than water. [ BASF Sodium-Potassium Alloy (NaK) http://www.basf.com/inorganics/pdfs/tech_datasheet/NaK.pdf 2009-03-05 ] [ May 2011 ] It reacts explosively with water and is stored under dry nitrogen (or, even better, dry argon ) for safety reasons. [ Strem Chemical MSDS http://www.strem.com/catalog/v/19-1910/54/potassium_11135-81-2 4 April 2012 ] When stored in air, it forms a yellow potassium superoxide coating and may ignite. This superoxide reacts explosively with organics. NaK is not dense enough to sink in most hydrocarbon s, but will sink in lighter mineral oil. It is unsafe to store in this manner if the superoxide has formed. A large explosion took place at the Oak Ridge Y-12 facility on December 8, 1999, when NaK cleaned up after an accidental spill and inappropriately treated with mineral oil was scratched with a metal tool. { Oak Ridge Explosion U.S. Department of Energy } [ May 2011 ] It also attacks Teflon. NaK has a very high surface tension, which makes large amounts of it pull into a bun -like shape. Its specific heat capacity is [ 982 J/(kg.K) ], which is roughly one-fourth of that for water. { Z. Anorg. Chem., 1912, 74, S.  152–156. } NaK alloy is liquid at room temperature. [ Usage ] [ Coolant ] NaK has been used as the coolant in experimental fast neutron nuclear reactor s. Unlike commercial plants, these are frequently shut down and defuelled. Use of lead or pure sodium, the other materials used in practical reactors, would require continual heating to maintain the coolant as a liquid. Use of NaK overcomes this. The Soviet RORSAT radar satellites were powered by a NaK-cooled reactor. { Space.com article about RORSATs leaking NaK after jettisoning their reactor core.

The Danish computer cooling company Danamics use NaK in their CPU cooler s. { Danamics Liquid Metal Technology Retrieved 10/28/2009. } [ May 2011 ] [ Desiccant ] Both sodium and potassium are used as desiccant s in drying solvent s prior to distillation. [ Synthesis and production ] Industrially, NaK is produced in a reactive distillation. [ 10.1021/ba-1957-0019.ch018 19 978-0-8412-0020-3 9780841221666 18 169–173 Advances in Chemistry Werner R. C. Jackson C. B. 1957-01-01 The Manufacture of Potassium and NaK ] In this continuous process, a distillation column is fed with potassium chloride and sodium. In the reaction zone, potassium chloride reacts with sodium to form sodium chloride and potassium. The lighter, boiling potassium is enriched in an upper fractionating zone and drawn at the column head while sodium chloride is withdrawn from the bottom.
