DVD-Audio is not intended to be a video delivery format and is not the same as video DVDs containing concert films or music videos. The first discs entered the marketplace in 2000. DVD-Audio was in a format war with Super Audio CD (SACD), another format for delivering high-fidelity audio content. Neither format has gained a strong position in any consumer market. [ Audio specifications ] DVD-Audio offers many possible configurations of audio channel s, ranging from single-channel mono to 5.1-channel surround sound, at various sampling frequencies and sample rates. [ http://patches.sonic.com/pdf/white-papers/wp_dvd_audio.pdf Understanding DVD-Audio Sonic Solutions PDF 2007-07-12 ] (The &quot;.1 &quot; denotes a Low-frequency effects channel (LFE) for bass and/or special audio effects.) Compared to the Compact Disc, the much higher capacity DVD format enables the inclusion of either: Considerably more music (with respect to total running time and quantity of songs) or Far higher audio quality, reflected by higher linear sampling rate s and higher bit-per-sample resolution, and/or Additional channels for spatial sound reproduction. Audio on a DVD-Audio disc can be stored in many different bit depth/sampling rate/channel combinations:   16-, 20- or 24- bit depth 44.1  kHz 48  kHz 88.2  kHz 96  kHz 176.4  kHz 192  kHz Mono (1.0) Stereo (2.0) Stereo (2.1) Stereo + mono surround (3.0 or 3.1) Quad (4.0 or 4.1) 3-stereo (3.0 or 3.1) 3-stereo + mono surround (4.0 or 4.1) Full surround (5.0 or 5.1) Different bit depth/sampling rate/channel combinations can be used on a single disc. For instance, a DVD-Audio disc may contain a 96  kHz/24-bit 5.1-channel audio track as well as a 192  kHz/24-bit stereo audio track. Also, the channels of a track can be split into two groups stored at different resolutions. For example, the front speakers could be 96/24, while the surrounds are 48/20. Audio is stored on the disc in Linear PCM format, which is either uncompressed or losslessly compressed with Meridian Lossless Packing. The maximum permissible total bit rate is 9.6 Megabits per second. Channel/resolution combinations that would exceed this need to be compressed. In uncompressed modes, it is possible to get up to 96/16 or 48/24 in 5.1, and 192/24 in stereo. To store 5.1 tracks in 88.2/20, 88.2/24, 96/20 or 96/24 MLP encoding is mandatory. The LFE channel is actually full range, and can be recorded at the same resolution as the other channels. This permits it to be used instead as an extra main channel, for example as a &quot; height &quot; speaker above the listening position; this has been done on some releases. Such usage is non-standard, and will often require special set-up by the end-user. If no native stereo audio exists on the disc, the DVD-Audio player may be able to downmix the 5.1-channel audio to two-channel stereo audio if the listener does not have a surround sound setup (provided that the coefficients were set in the stream at authoring). Downmixing can only be done to two-channel stereo, not to other configurations, such as 4.0 quad. DVD-Audio may also feature menus, text subtitles, still images and video, plus in high end authoring systems it is also possible to link directly into a Video_TS folder that might contain video tracks, as well as PCM stereo and other &quot; bonus &quot; features. [ Player compatibility ] With the introduction of the DVD-Audio format, some kind of backward compatibility with existing DVD-Video players was desired, although not required. To address this, most DVD-Audio discs also contain DVD-Video compatible data that allows the standard DVD-Video Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio track on the disc [ http://www.crutchfieldadvisor.com/ISEO-rgbtcspd/learningcenter/home/cd_dvdsacd.html SACD &amp; DVD-Audio: Ultra-High-Resolution Music Crutchfield Advisor 12 July 2007 ] (which can be downmixed to two channels for listeners with no surround sound setup). Many DVD-Video players also offer the option to create a Dolby MP matrix-encoded soundtrack for older surround sound systems lacking Dolby Digital or DTS decoding. Some discs also include a native Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo, and even a DTS  96/24 5.1-channel, audio track. [ http://www.5dot1.com/articles/dvd_audio.html What is DVD-Audio? 5dot1.com 12 July 2007 ] Since the DVD-Audio format is a member of the DVD family, a single disc can have multiple layers, and even two sides that contain audio and video material. A common configuration is a single-sided DVD with content in both the DVD-Video (VIDEO_TS) and DVD-Audio (AUDIO_TS) directories. The high-resolution, Packed PCM audio encoded using MLP is only playable by DVD players containing DVD-Audio decoding capability. DVD-Video content, which can include LPCM, Dolby or DTS material, and even video, makes the disc compatible with all DVD players. Other disc configurations may consist of double layer DVDs (DVD-9) or two-sided discs (DVD-10, DVD-14 or DVD-18). Some labels have released two-sided DVD titles that contain DVD-Audio content on one side and DVD-Video content on the other, the Classic Records HDAD being one such example. Unofficial playback of DVD-Audio on a PC is now possible through freeware audio player foobar2000 for Windows using an open source plug-in extension called DVDADecoder. [ http://dvdadecoder.sourceforge.net/ DVD-Audio Decoder and Watermark Detector Maxim V. Anisiutkin SourceForge 19 October 2010 ] Cyberlink&apos;s PowerDVD Version 8 provides an official method of playing DVD-Audio discs. This feature was dropped from version 9 onwards. { http://www.cyberlink.com } [ March 2011 ] Creative also provide a dedicated DVD-Audio player with some of its Soundblaster products, but this latter option is not compatible with versions of Windows later than XP. { http://uk.creative.com } [ March 2011 ] [ Preamplifier/Surround Processor interface ] In order to play DVD-Audio, a preamplifier or surround controller with six analog inputs was originally required. [ http://www.timefordvd.com/tutorial/DVD-AudioTutorial.shtml DVD-Audio Tutorial TimeForDVD.com 2007-07-12 2002-06-05 ] Whereas DVD-Video audio formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS can be sent via the player&apos;s digital output to a receiver for conversion to analog form and distribution to speakers, DVD-Audio is not allowed to be delivered via unencrypted digital audio link at sample rates higher than 48  kHz (i.e., ordinary DVD-Video quality) due to concerns about digital copying. However encrypted digital formats have now been approved by the DVD Forum, the first of which was Meridian Audio&apos;s MHR (Meridian High Resolution). The High Definition Multimedia Interface ( HDMI  1.1) also allows encrypted digital audio to be carried up to DVD-Audio specification (6 × 24-bit/96  kHz channels or 2 × 24-bit/192  kHz channels). The six channels of audio information can thus be sent to the amplifier by several different methods: Turn such an interface off completely. This option is preferred by the music publishers. Downconvert the audio to a 2-channel 16-bit/48  kHz PCM signal. The music publishers are not enthusiastic about this because it permits the production of a CD-quality copy, something they still expect to sell, besides DVD-A. Downconvert the audio to 2 channels, but keeping the original sample size and bit rate if the producer sets a flag on the DVD-A disc telling the player to do so. { A final option is to modify the player, capturing the high resolution digital signals before they are fed to internal D/A converters and convert it to } { S/PDIF, giving full range digital (but only stereo) sound. There exist already do-it-yourself solutions for some players. There also exists an option to equip a DVD-A player with multiple S/PDIF outputs, for full resolution multichannel digital output. See: Six channel S/P-DIF output board. } [ Sound quality ] { From a purely technical standpoint, the audio resolution of a DVD-Audio disc can be substantially higher than standard } { red book CD audio. DVD-Audio supports bit depths up to 24-bit and sample rates up to 192  kHz, while CD audio is 16-bit, 44.1  kHz. In both cases, the source recording may have been made at a much higher bit and sample rate, and down-converted for commercial release. } Many DVD-Audio releases are older, standard-definition audio recordings that have been remixed in 5.1 and upsampled to DVD-Audio&apos;s higher resolution. However, the fidelity of the upsampled audio will be limited by the source material quality, when the master recording is in digital format, and may not exceed the quality of existing CD releases of the same albums. Recordings that are made using high-resolution PCM encoding can be released with a resolution that is higher than standard CD. Three of the major music labels, Universal Music, EMI and Warner Bros. Records, and several smaller audiophile labels (such as AIX Records, Claudio Records and DTS Entertainment) have released or are continuing to release albums on DVD-Audio, but the number is minimal compared to standard CDs. New high-definition titles have been released in standard DVD-Video format (which can contain two-channel Linear PCM audio data ranging from 48  kHz/16-bit to 96  kHz/24-bit), &quot; HDAD &quot;, { &quot; HDAD &quot; at surroundablog.blogs.com } which includes a DVD-Video format recording on one side and DVD-Audio on the other, CD/DVD packages, which can include the album on both CD and DVD-Audio, or DualDisc, which can contain DVD-Audio content on the DVD side. In addition, some titles that were initially released as a standalone DVD-Audio disc, such as The Grateful Dead &apos;s American Beauty and R.E.M. &apos;s Automatic for the People, were re-released as a CD/DVD package or as a DualDisc. [ Copy protection ] DVD-Audio discs may optionally employ a copy protection mechanism called Content Protection for Prerecorded Media (CPPM). [ http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0%2C1558%2C1231582%2C00.asp Digital Content Protection, Part II ExtremeTech 2007-07-12 2003-08-25 Labriola Don ] CPPM, managed by the 4C Entity, was designed to prevent users from extracting audio to computers and portable media players. Because DVD-Video&apos;s content-scrambling system (CSS) was quickly broken, DVD-Audio&apos;s developers sought a better method of blocking unauthorized duplications. They developed CPPM, which uses a media key block (MKB) to authenticate DVD-Audio players. In order to decrypt the audio, players must obtain a media key from the MKB, which also is encrypted. The player must use its own unique key to decrypt the MKB. If a DVD-Audio player&apos;s decryption key is compromised, that key can be rendered useless for decrypting future DVD-Audio discs. DVD-Audio discs can also utilize digital watermarking technology developed by the Verance Corporation, typically embedded into the audio once every thirty seconds. If a DVD-Audio player encounters a watermark on a disc without a valid MKB, it will halt playback. [ http://www.highfidelityreview.com/news/news.asp?newsnumber%3D14550899 DVD-Audio Copy Protection Defeated via WinDVD Software Hack HighFidelityReview.com 2007-07-12 2005-06-07 Robinson Stuart M http://web.archive.org/web/20070608032029/http%3A//www.highfidelityreview.com/news/news.asp?newsnumber%3D14550899 2007-06-08 ] The 4C Entity also developed a similar specification, Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM), which is used on Secure Digital card s. DVD-Audio&apos;s copy protection was overcome in 2005 by tools which allow data to be decrypted or converted to 6 channel.WAV files without going through lossy digital-to-analog conversion. Previously that conversion had required expensive equipment to retain all six channels of audio rather than having it downmixed to stereo. In the digital method, the decryption is done by a commercial software player which has been patched to allow access to the unprotected audio. In 2007 the encryption scheme was overcome with a tool called dvdcpxm. In 12 February 2008 a program called DVD-Audio Explorer was released, containing aforementioned libdvdcpxm coupled with an open source MLP decoder. [ http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p%3D1099342#post1099342 DVD-Audio ripper 2008-04-09 ] Like DVD-Video decryption, such tools may be illegal to use in the United States under the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act. While the Recording Industry Association of America has been successful in keeping these tools off websites, they are still distributed on P2P file sharing networks and newsgroups, [ http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid%3D05%2F07%2F06%2F1740206 DVD-Audio&apos;s CPPM Circumvented Slashdot.org 2007-07-12 2005-07-06 ] Additionally, in 2007 the widely-used commercial software DVDFab Platinum added DVD-Audio decryption, allowing users to back up a full DVD-A image to ISO.
