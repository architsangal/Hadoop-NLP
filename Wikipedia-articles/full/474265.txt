The administrators officially disavowed what they called &quot; kooky tsunami conspiracy theories &quot;. They added, &quot; One wonders why the author [of the Times article] did not spend five minutes over at Free Republic and instead write an article about how conservatives think the tsunami was some sort of retribution from God, or how Muslims deserved it. &quot; [ &quot; Skinner &quot; About the New York Times, Fox News, and Kooky Tsunami Conspiracy Theories DU 2005-05-05 http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az%3Dview_all%26amp%3Baddress%3D104x2907807 2007-05-02 ] The administrators also sent a letter to the Times, which was printed.
