Accessed January 26, 2012. } [ History ] Swedesboro was settled by a small group of Swedes from Pennsylvania and Delaware in the mid-1600s. The English Colonial government needed a road between the communities of Burlingtown and Salem, so they built the Kings Highway in 1691 which opened the southern portion of Gloucester County to more settlers. The area offered an abundance of fertile sandy soil, prime farmland and vasts tracks of oak, birch, maple and pine trees. Originally, the town was called Raccoon. In 1765 the name was changed to Swedesboro. The early Swedes and Finns were fishermen, hunters and farmers. Through the late 1800s, Raccoon Creek was a water route that was naturally deep enough to transport wood and farming projects to Philadelphia by the Delaware River.
