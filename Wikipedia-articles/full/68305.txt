[ June 2007 ] [ 1974 09 13 ] [ 1978 07 21 ] { Ended } Chico and the Man is an American sitcom which ran on NBC for four seasons, from September 13, 1974 to July 21, 1978. It stars Jack Albertson as Ed Brown (the Man), the cantankerous owner of a run down garage in an East Los Angeles barrio, and (until his suicide late in the third season) Freddie Prinze as Chico Rodriguez, an upbeat, optimistic Chicano young man who comes in looking for a job. It was the first U.S. television series set in a Mexican-American neighborhood.

A hard-drinking anglo widower, Ed stubbornly refuses to fit in with the changing East L.A. neighborhood and has alienated most of the people who live around him. He uses ethnic slurs and berates Chico, a Latino, in an effort to get him to leave when Chico comes looking for a job. Yet Chico sees something in Ed, and sneaks back in at night to clean up the garage and move into an old van that Ed has parked inside. As Ed sees all the effort Chico has put in, he begins to warm to Chico. Over the course of the show, Ed grew to see Chico as family, although Ed will deny this on several occasions. The chemistry between Jack Albertson&apos;s &quot; Ed &quot; and Freddie Prinze&apos;s &quot; Chico &quot; was a major factor in making the show a hit in its first two seasons. It started in the top ten and remained there for the first two seasons. The show was created by James Komack who produced other successful TV shows such as The Courtship of Eddie&apos;s Father and Welcome Back, Kotter. Freddie Prinze was discovered by Komack after he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in December 1973. Komack thought he would be perfect for the role of Chico Rodriguez. As the show progressed, Chico&apos;s background was revealed as being Mexican on his father&apos;s side and Puerto Rican on his mother&apos;s side, and (in a nod to Prinze&apos;s Hungarian ancestry) &quot;...my grandmother speaks a little Hungarian! &quot; ). Chico was revealed to have spent part of his childhood in Hungary following the death of his mother, being raised by his Aunt Connie (a character who appeared in two other episodes). Chico attempts to explain his situation to Ed by portraying it as the dilemma of his distant cousin in Hungary, torn between the farmer for whom he now works and whom he has grown to love, and another farmer who has offered him a better job. During this scene and this episode, the love between these disparate characters was made clear for the first time, which Carlos notes when he releases Chico from his promise. By the second season, Ed begins to see that he is a part of a bigger world, although he still complains about it. By this time he has found himself a girlfriend by the name of Flora (played by Carole Cook ). [ Freddie Prinze&apos;s death ] After struggling with depression and drug use, Freddie Prinze shot himself on January 28, 1977.

Mcfarland Press. p. 73. } The last episode to star Prinze, &quot; Ed Talks to God &quot;, was taped several hours before he shot himself. [ Post-Prinze episodes ] After Prinze&apos;s death, the producers considered canceling the show, but opted instead to try replacing the character. To write Chico out of the script, they had the other characters comment that he had gone to visit his father in Mexico. The third season finished out with episodes focusing on the other characters in the show. Early in the fourth season, a replacement for Chico was introduced. Instead of an adult, the producers brought in twelve year-old Raul, played by Gabriel Melgar. His first appearance came when Ed and Louie go on a fishing trip to Tijuana and find the Mexican orphan hiding out in their trunk on their return. At the end of this episode, Ed is putting Raul to bed and accidentally calls him Chico. Raul corrects him and Ed remarks that, &quot; You&apos;re all Chicos to me. &quot; Ed eventually adopts Raul, only to have Raul&apos;s overprotective aunt Charo – played by the singer Charo – come from Spain and try to become a part of the &quot; family &quot; as well. A two-part episode ran in the final season in which Raul discovers Chico&apos;s belongings in a closet. Ed catches Raul playing Chico&apos;s guitar and Ed smashes it on the van in anger. Raul believes Ed does not love him anymore and runs away to Mexico. Ed goes after him and finally explains to Raul that Chico died, but did not say how, putting a measure of closure on the fate of Chico in the series. Toward the end of the show&apos;s final season, actress Julie Hill was added to the cast as Monica, Ed&apos;s attractive 18-year-old adopted niece. She had come to Los Angeles to get into show business, and lived in Chico&apos;s old van while awaiting her big break. Chico and the Man did not pull in the ratings it did in previous seasons. The show&apos;s ratings declined after Prinze&apos;s death, and the show was canceled at the end of the fourth season.
