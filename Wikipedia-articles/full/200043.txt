[ April 2012 ] [ the 2006 film Catch a Fire (film) ] [ Alternative cover studio BobMarleyCatchAFire.jpg Original 1973 cover with the flip case ] Catch a Fire, released on 13 April 1973, is the fifth album for Jamaica n reggae band Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers, and the first the band released on Island Records.

Catch a Fire peaked at number 171 and number 51 on Billboard s 200 and Black Albums charts, respectively. The album has received critical acclaim, including being listed at number 123 on Rolling Stone s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the second highest placement of the five Bob Marley albums on the list, after the posthumous compilation album Legend. It is also regarded as one of the top reggae albums of all time. [ Background ] Around the time JAD Records collected 72 of the greatest Marley tracks, businessman Danny Sims made a deal with Johnny Nash to produce the film Want So Much To Believe in Sweden, while Sims asked Nash to write some songs for the soundtrack. Nash and Marley therefore worked together. Marley moved to Sweden and began to tour successfully through Europe. Subsequently, Sims asked Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer and the Barrett Brothers to join Marley&apos;s band The Wailers. When the musicians arrived in England, their backing band was unprofessional.

The Wailers had to postpone tours, and Marley had financial issues. The band asked promoter Brent Clarke in the hope that he would help them. Clarke contacted Chris Blackwell from Island Records, who had released many Wailers singles in Great Britain. He then promised Clarke an advance of 8000 pounds for their next album, and Clarke lent the Wailers some money for their way back to Jamaica.

He, however, got into a contract dispute between CBS Records and Sims. The case was won by the first, who received US$9000 and a two-percent contribution to their first six albums, and Sims allegedly received 5000 pounds for the loss. Catch a Fire features many background musicians, but none of those were credited in the liner notes. Muscle Shoals session guitarist Wayne Perkins, who at that time recorded a new Smith, Perkins &amp; Smith album at the Island Studios on the Basing Street, was asked by Blackwell in the early 1972 to make overdub s for Catch a Fire in the studio below. Perkins, not knowing what reggae was, agreed with the proposal and first played the guitar solo, including the three- octave feedback, on &quot; Concrete Jungle &quot;. After playing the lead guitar on &quot; Stir it Up &quot;, which was later covered by Nash&apos;s Rabbit and the Jungles, in live gigs also known as Sons of the Jungle, on their I Can See Clearly Now, peaking at number 11 on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; Hot 100 chart, he then went back to the studio to complete his album. Rabbit Bundrick played on all songs on numerous keyboard s, including on a synthesizer and a clavinet. Robbie Shakespeare played the bass on &quot; Congrete Jungle &quot;, while organist Tyrone Downie performed on the same track as well as on &quot; Stir it Up &quot;. Chris Karen, Francisco Willie Pep and Winston Wright served as percussion ists, and the female choral singing was performed by Rita Marley and her friend Marcia Griffith, the latter of whom was already popular in Jamaica as a solo artist and together with her husband Bob Andy released successful singles.

Catch a Fire is about &quot; the current state of urban poverty &quot;, and &quot; Slave Driver &quot; &quot; connects the present to past injustices &quot;. But politics are not the main theme; &quot; Stir it Up &quot;, for example, is a love song.

When the band flew to the United States, percussionist and singer Bunny Livingston did not enjoy the climate, and performed for the first and last time as a member of the Wailers in London for the TV show The Old Grey Whistle Test, before being replaced by Joe Higgs.
