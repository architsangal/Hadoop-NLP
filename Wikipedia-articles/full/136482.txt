[ History ] [ Beginnings ] In 1855, Parker County was created by the Texas State Legislature and named for pioneer and State Representative Isaac Parker. Parker was the uncle of Cynthia Ann Parker, a little girl who was stolen from her home by Indians during the Texas Revolution. Cynthia Ann lived among the Comanche and became the mother of Chief Quanah Parker. Later, when she was overtaken in flight with an Indian raiding party, Isaac Parker recognized her as his long-lost niece. The Town of Weatherford was named for the State Senator for this district, Thomas Jefferson Weatherford (1811-1867) of Dallas. According to his cousin, Senator Weatherford never set foot in the town. The first settlers had arrived less than ten years earlier. They were many Native American attacks between the years of 1846 and 1874. There are several headstones in Parker County that read &quot; Killed by Indians. &quot; The railroad arrived in June 1880. The Santa Fe Depot (which today houses the Weatherford Chamber of Commerce) was built in 1908 under Jim Crow laws, with waiting rooms segregated and separated by the ticket office. In 1895, the town’s still existing daily newspaper, the Weatherford Democrat, began publication. The Weatherford Telegram began publishing as a weekly newspaper in 2006. [ Western Heritage ] Cattle drover Oliver Loving is buried in Weatherford’s Greenwood Cemetery. After being attacked by Indians in New Mexico in 1867, Loving’s dying wish to his friend, Charles Goodnight, was to be buried in his home, Parker County. Goodnight brought the body back six hundred miles by wagon for burial. The story is the inspiration behind Texas author Larry McMurtry ’s novel, Lonesome Dove. A year earlier, Goodnight had invented the first chuckwagon which catered to cowboys on a cattle drive that would later become known as the Goodnight-Loving Trail. Boze Ikard, who served with Goodnight and for whom the McMurtry character “Deets” was modeled, was also laid to rest in the Greenwood Cemetery. [ Religion ] Weatherford lies in the geographic region commonly referred to as the &quot; Bible Belt &quot;. As such, it is home to churches of several Christian denominations including (among others) Baptist, Pentecostal, Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Mormon and Roman Catholic. There are no worship centers for any other major religions within the city limits, with practitioners of those religions commonly traveling to nearby Fort Worth to attend religious services. [ Peach Capital of Texas ] The city was named by the Texas Legislature as the Peach Capital of Texas due to the peaches produced by area growers. As such, the peach is celebrated each year at the Parker County Peach Festival, which is Weatherford’s largest event and one of the best-attended festivals in Texas. [ June 2008 ] [ Cutting Horse Capital of the World ] Weatherford is known as the Cutting Horse Capital of the World. [ Historic buildings ] Weatherford also has a number of historic homes and buildings.

Another landmark is the Second Empire style Parker County Courthouse, which is located in the geographical center of the county in downtown Weatherford.
