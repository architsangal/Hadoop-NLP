In addition to being a member of Phish since 1985, McConnell has also had several musical liaisons during his career, including an instrumental trio named Vida Blue. He released his first solo album, featuring original compositions, in 2007. [ Background ] McConnell was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1963. By age four he was learning to play the piano, and when his family relocated to Basking Ridge, New Jersey, in 1969 he continued his musical studies, eventually playing in bands with friends by his seventh grade. His father, Dr. Jack B. McConnell, worked at McNeil Laboratories and helped to develop Tylenol and the MRI. The elder McConnell then started a free health clinic for kids that was staffed by retired health workers in Hilton Head, South Carolina. McConnell spent a year at Gill St. Bernard&apos;s School, in Gladstone, New Jersey before moving away. McConnell spent his senior year of high school at Lawrence Academy at Groton, in Groton, Massachusetts, and then attended Southern Methodist University from Fall 1982 to Spring 1984, where he joined Kappa Alpha Order. McConnell transferred to Goddard College that fall and graduated in December 1987. This is where he met his mentor, Karl Boyle, and wrote his senior study, The Art of Improvisation under Boyle&apos;s guidance. McConnell joined Phish in 1985 and played with the band for the first time on May 3 of that year. { Phish.net Setlisths:1985 Accessed: August 04, 2011. } McConnell has written a number of Phish originals including &quot; Cars Trucks Buses, &quot; &quot; Magilla, &quot; &quot; Army of One, &quot; &quot; I Been Around, &quot; &quot; Windy City, &quot; and &quot; If I Told You. &quot; He has also coauthored numerous other songs with the band. { The Phish Companion } [ Other musical projects ] In 1997, McConnell played keyboards on the title track of Scottish band Travis &apos; debut album Good Feeling. The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite, who also produced Phish&apos;s 1996 Billy Breathes album. In 2001, McConnell appeared on Tenacious D &apos;s debut album. That fall, he joined the band on stage for a show at the Higher Ground nightclub in Winooski, Vermont. With Oteil Burbridge and Russell Batiste, McConnell was the founding member of Vida Blue. After a two-year hiatus from the music industry following the breakup of Phish, McConnell returned as a solo artist, recording an album of all new material in 2006. This eponymous album was released April 17, 2007 through Sony/BMG ’s Legacy Recordings. On signing with Legacy, McConnell has stated, &quot; I know a lot of people on the internet, and that&apos;s certainly an option — especially these days and especially if you&apos;re catering to the Phish fans who already know who I am. But I wanted a little bit more than that... I was proud of the record, and I wanted as many people as possible to hear it when I was done with it. &quot; [ John Metzger A Fresh Start with Page McConnell http://www.musicbox-online.com/interviews/page-mcconnell-05292007.html Music Box Magazine May 2007 2007-08-21 ] The album features Phish bandmates Jon Fishman, Trey Anastasio, and Mike Gordon, though they all play on separate tracks. McConnell headlined the High Sierra Music Festival in July 2007, which was held in Quincy, CA. His touring band features multi-instrumentalist Jared Slomoff, guitarist Adam Zimmon, bassist Rob O&apos;Dea, and drummer Gabe Jarrett. Said McConnell, &quot; I have a really good feeling about this group. It feels like a band, although it&apos;s in its infancy right now. It really does feel like there is a collective consciousness. &quot; [ Instruments ] Page McConnell&apos;s current rig includes: - a Yamaha C7 concert grand (7&apos;6 &quot; ) piano (since 2.3.93), - a Hammond B3 organ with a Leslie 122 speaker (modified with individual percussion and chorus output knobs for a more tuned effect), - a 1969 Fender Rhodes Silver Sparkle Top Suitcase 73 Model electric piano, - a Hohner D6 Clavinet (often used in sync with a wah-wah pedal), - a Moog Little Phatty (sometimes switched out for a Prophet &apos;08 ), - and a Yamaha CS-60 polyphonic synthesizer. - Since 2009, Page has been using a Moog Liberation Keytar when playing Edgar Winter &apos;s &quot; Frankenstein &quot; with Phish - In 2010, Page brought back his Wurlitzer 106p electric piano to his live rig - In 2011, he brought back his theremin for the first time since 1997 In the past, his rig has included a Moog Source, Alesis Andromeda A6 &amp; a Yamaha Motif.
