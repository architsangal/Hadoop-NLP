At a distance of approximately 7.8 light year s from the Earth, it has an apparent magnitude of 13.5 and can only be seen with a large telescope. Wolf 359 is one of the nearest stars to the Solar System; only the Alpha Centauri system, Proxima Centauri, and Barnard&apos;s Star are known to be closer. Its proximity to Earth has led to its mention in several works of fiction. Wolf 359 is one of the faintest and lowest-mass stars known. Its photosphere has a temperature of about 2,800   K, which is low enough for chemical compound s to form and survive. The absorption line s of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity, Wolf 359 is a flare star that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescope s. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. No companions or debris have been detected in orbit around it. [ Observation history and name ] Wolf 359 first came to the attention of astronomers because of the relatively high rate of transverse motion against the background, known as the proper motion. A high rate of proper motion may indicate that a star is located nearby, as more distant stars must move at higher velocities in order to achieve the same rate of angular travel across the celestial sphere. The motion of Wolf 359 was first measured in 1917 by German astronomer Max Wolf, with the aid of astrophotography. In 1919 he published a catalog of over one thousand high proper motion stars, including this one, that are still identified by his name. He listed this star as 359, and the star has since been referred to as Wolf 359 in reference to the position in Max Wolf&apos;s catalogue. The first parallax measurement of Wolf 359 was reported in 1928 from the Mount Wilson Observatory, yielding an annual shift in the star&apos;s position of [ 0.409 ± 0.009 arcsecond s ]. From this shift, and the known size of the Earth&apos;s orbit, the distance to the star could be estimated. It was the lowest-mass and faintest star known until the discovery of VB 10 in 1944. The infrared magnitude of the star was measured in 1957. In 1969, a brief flare in luminosity was observed on it, linking it to the class of variable star s known as flare star s. [ Properties ] Wolf 359 has a stellar classification of M6.5, although various sources list a spectral class of M5.5, M6 or M8. This M-type star is known as a red dwarf : it is called red, because the energy emission of the star reaches a peak in the red and infrared parts of the spectrum. Wolf 359 has a very low luminosity, emitting about 0.1% of the Sun&apos;s energy. If it were moved to the location of the Sun, it would appear ten times as bright as the full Moon. At an estimated 9% of the Sun&apos;s mass, Wolf 359 is just above the lowest limit at which a star can perform hydrogen fusion through the proton–proton chain reaction : 8% of the Sun&apos;s mass. ( Substellar object s below this limit are known as brown dwarf s.) The radius of Wolf 359 is an estimated 16% of the Sun&apos;s radius, or about 110,000  km. For comparison, the equatorial radius of the planet Jupiter is 71,492  km, which is 65% as large as Wolf 359&apos;s. The entire star is undergoing convection, whereby the energy generated at the core is being transferred toward the surface by the convective motion of plasma, rather than by transmission through radiation. This circulation redistributes any accumulation of helium that is generated through stellar nucleosynthesis at the core throughout the star. This will allow the star to remain on the main sequence as a hydrogen fusing star proportionately longer than a star such as the Sun where the helium steadily accumulates at the core. In combination with a lower rate of hydrogen consumption due to the low mass, the convection will allow Wolf 359 to remain a main-sequence star for eight trillion years. A search of this star by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed no stellar companions, although this does not preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope&apos;s detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate the lack of a debris disk in orbit around it. [ Outer atmosphere ] The outer light-emitting layer of a star is known as the photosphere. Temperature estimates of the photosphere of Wolf 359 range from 2,500  K to 2,900  K, which is sufficiently cool for equilibrium chemistry to occur. The resulting chemical compound s survive long enough to be observed through their spectral lines. Numerous molecular bands appear in the spectrum of Wolf 359, including those of carbon monoxide (CO), iron hydride (FeH), chromium hydride ( CrH ), water (H 2 O), magnesium hydride (MgH), vanadium(II) oxide (VO), titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and possibly the molecule CaOH. Since there are no lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion at the core. This indicates the star must be at least 100 million years old. Beyond the photosphere lies a nebulous, high temperature region known as the corona. In 2001, Wolf 359 became the first star other than the Sun to have the spectrum of its corona observed from a ground-based telescope. The spectrum showed emission line s of Fe XIII, which is heavily ion ized iron that has been stripped of twelve of its electrons. The strength of this line can vary over a time period of several hours, which may be evidence of microflare heating. Wolf 359 is classified as a UV Ceti -type flare star, which is a star that undergoes brief, energetic increases in luminosity because of magnetic activity in the photosphere. Its variable star designation is CN Leonis. Wolf 359 has a relatively high flare rate. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope detected 32 flare events within a two hour period, with energies of 10 27 erg s (10 20 joule s ) and higher. The mean magnetic field at the surface of Wolf 359 has a strength of about 2.2   kG (0.22 teslas ), but this varies significantly on time scales as short as six hours. By comparison, the magnetic field of the Sun averages 1  gauss (100 µT ), although it can rise as high as 3  kG (0.3 T) in active sunspot regions. During flare activity, Wolf 359 has been observed emitting X-ray s and gamma ray s. [ Motion ] The rotation of a star causes a doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, this results in a broadening of the absorption line s in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates of rotation. However, only the rotational motion in the direction of the observer can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star&apos;s rotation. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359&apos;s equator is less than 3  km/s, which is below the threshold of detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the spin down of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective stars like this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. The proper motion of this star against the background is 4.696   arcsecond s per year, and it is moving away from the Sun at a velocity of 19  km/s. When translated into the galactic coordinate system, this motion corresponds to a space velocity of [ (U, V, W) ] = [ (–26, –44, –18) km/s ]. The space velocity of Wolf 359 implies that it belongs to the population of old disk stars. It is following an orbit through the Milky Way galaxy that will carry it as close as [ 20.5 kly kpc on ] and as distant as [ 28 kly kpc on ] from the Galactic Center. The galactic orbit has an eccentrity of 0.156, and the star can travel as far as [ 444 ly pc ] away from the galactic plane. The closest stellar neighbor to Wolf 359 is the red dwarf star Ross 128, [ 3.79 ly pc on on ] away. Approximately 13,850 years ago, Wolf 359 was at its minimal distance of about [ 7.35 ly pc on ] from the Sun.
