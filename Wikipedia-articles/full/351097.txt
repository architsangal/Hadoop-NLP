[ West Midlands (county) West Midlands (region) ] Map of the West Midlands Urban Area. The West Midlands conurbation is the name given to the large conurbation that includes the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton and the large towns of Sutton Coldfield, Dudley, Walsall, West Bromwich, Solihull, Stourbridge and Halesowen in the English West Midlands. Not to be confused with the region or metropolitan county of the same name, the conurbation does not include parts of the county such as Coventry, but does include parts of the surrounding counties of Staffordshire (e.g. Little Aston, Perton ), Warwickshire (specifically Coleshill and Water Orton ) and Worcestershire ( Hagley, Hollywood ). According to the 2001 Census the area had a population of 2,284,093, making it the second most populated in the United Kingdom behind Greater London. [ Constituent parts ] Although the exact boundaries of any conurbation are open to debate, dependent on what criteria are used to determine where an urban area ceases, the Office for National Statistics defines the West Midlands Urban Area as including the urban areas (in decreasing size) of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Dudley, and Walsall amongst others. These settlements are not coterminous with the Metropolitan Boroughs of the same name, and the ONS takes its settlement boundaries within the conurbation as the pre-1974 local authorities. The conurbation is unusual in having a number of large settlements within, with Birmingham (2nd), Wolverhampton (13th), Dudley (19th) and Walsall (28th) all being amongst the largest 30 urban sub-areas in England. The area of conurbation between Birmingham and Wolverhampton is known as the Black Country. The Black Country is unusual in that it has no single centre, having grown up from a number of historic market towns and industrial villages that coalesced during the 20th century. It remains essentially polyfocal with many of the towns and villages remaining recognisable communities. Inhabitants of the Black Country generally resist hints at any relationship to people living in Birmingham. This can be seen by recent (2006) controversy regarding the name of the newly created city region. &quot; Greater Birmingham &quot; was seen as unacceptable, and the final name given was &quot; Birmingham, Coventry and the Black Country &quot;. [ November 2011 ] Coventry is separated from the West Midlands conurbation by the Meriden Gap, and other urban areas, such as Cannock and Codsall are also only narrowly avoided. [ Relationship to Metropolitan County ] Occasionally the conurbation is seen as being coterminous with the West Midlands county; however, this includes Coventry, which is separate from the main urban area, and excludes the parts of the surrounding counties of Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire that fall within the conurbation. For administrative purposes, the vast majority of the conurbation falls within the six Metropolitan Borough s of Birmingham, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton. Between 1974 and 1986 these areas (along with Coventry) were additionally administered by the West Midlands County Council. Some bodies such as the West Midlands Police and Centro (the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive ) still cover the Metropolitan County, but not the entire urban area. [ Settlements ] The West Midlands conurbation consists of the following settlements: [ 2001 census: Key Statistics for Urban Areas http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk%3D8271%26amp%3BMore%3DY ONS 2008-12-04 ] [ 1991 Census: West Midlands Urban Area http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/west_midlands_urban_area.asp ONS 2008-12-04 ] [ 1981 Key Statistics for Urban Areas: The Midlands Table 1 Office for National Statistics 1981 ] Rank(2001) Settlement Population (2001) Population(1991) Population(1981) 1 Birmingham 970,892 965,928 1,024,118 2 Wolverhampton 251,462 257,943 265,631 3 Dudley 194,919 192,171 187,367 4 Walsall 170,994 174,739 178,852 5 Oldbury / Smethwick 139,855 145,542 153,461 6 West Bromwich 136,940 146,386 154,531 7 Sutton Coldfield 105,452 106,001 103,097 8 Solihull 94,753 94,531 94,613 9 Stourbridge 55,480 55,624 55,499 10 Halesowen 55,273 57,918 57,532 11 Brownhills 19,866 18,159 18,200 12 Knowle / Bentley Heath 18,452 13 Aldridge 15,659 16,832 17,589 14 Pelsall 10,524 10,007 10,328 15 Shelfield 6,807 7,079 6,029 16 Coleshill 6,235 6,324 17 Yew Tree 6,109 18 Rushall 5,864 5,871 6,137 19 Hagley 5,723 5,417 5,754 20 Shelly Green 5,702 21 Water Orton 3,573 3,555 22 Cheswick Green 2,261 2,511 Knowle 17,588 16,872 Bentley Heath 5,984 Notes: Knowle and Bentley Heath are considered as one settlement in 2001, but are considered separately in 1991 and 1981.
