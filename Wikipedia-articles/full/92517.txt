[ William Smyth ] { Great Comet of 1811, as drawn by William Henry Smyth } William Henry Smyth (21 January 1788 – 8 September 1865) was an English sailor, hydrographer, astronomer and numismatist. [ Private Life ] He was born at 42 Great Peter Street, Westminster, London. He was the only son of Joseph Brewer Palmer Smyth and Georgina Caroline Pitt Pilkington, granddaughter of the Irish writer Laetitia Pilkington who was a protégée of Jonathan Swift. His father was a colonial American who lived in East Jersey. He was an English loyalist, however, and after the American Revolution emigrated to England where his son was born shortly before Joseph died. His half brother was the famous painter &amp; traveller Augustus Earle. Early in his navel career, Smyth sought and was given permission by Lord Exmouth to allow his half brother Augustus passage through the Mediterranean aboard the RN naval gunship that he commanded &amp; which was part of Admiral Exmouth Royal Navy fleet. &quot; By the maternal side he was great grandson of Matthew Pilkington &quot; from &apos;Worthyies of Bucks &amp; men of note&apos; Robt Gibbs 1886 p 363. He married Eliza Anne &quot; Annarella &quot; Warington in Messina on 7 October 1815, when they were 27; she was ten weeks the younger; a portrait of them can be seen at http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-admiral.htm; this was painted while they were cataloguing the Duke of Northumberland&apos;s collection, see bibliography below. The portrait was destroyed during the Blitz. Others are at http://christiesinternational.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=salesummary &amp; intObjectID=5324871 &amp; sid=fe2bc637-0df9-4c7e-aebd-92a8b05199f5http://www.npgprints.com/image.php?imgref=5876 Smyth suffered a heart attack at his home near Aylesbury in early September, 1865, and at first seemed to recover. On 8 September he showed the planet Jupiter to his young grandson, Arthur Smyth Flower, through a telescope. A few hours later in the early morning of 9 September, at age 78, he died. He was buried in the churchyard at Stone near Aylesbury. [ Career ] In 1802, at the age of 14, young William Henry ran away to sea from life in a succession of London boarding houses, joining a merchant vessel which later was taken over by the Royal Navy. During the Napoleonic wars he served in the Mediterranean, earning the nickname &quot; Mediterranean Smyth &quot; for his survey work - his charts of the Mediterranean were still in use in 1961. During a hydrographic survey in 1817 he met the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi in Palermo, Sicily, and visited his observatory; this sparked his interest in astronomy.

Their three sons were Charles Piazzi Smyth, Sir Warington Wilkinson Smyth and General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth. Of their eight daughters, two died young, a third &quot; married and died &quot; aged 20, another also died at 20, unmarried, and another unmarried at 25, of diphtheria. Their other three daughters were Henrietta Grace, who married Rev. Professor Baden Powell and was mother of nine, including Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell (often referred to as &quot; B-P &quot; ); while Georgiana Rosetta married Sir William Henry Flower and had seven children; and Ellen Philedelphia, who married Capt. Henry Toynbee and sailed out to Australia as a young bride in 1855. She died childless in 1881 aged 52 after a long illness. His daughter Georgiana Rosetta, later in life, modelled herself on Queen Victoria. On one occasion she was entertaining some acquaintances to tea, and in discussion pointed to the portrait referred to above, saying, &quot; He was a numismatist, you know. &quot; whereupon one of the visitors replied sympathetically, &quot; Oh, I&apos;m so sorry! &quot;, as if it were a disease (perhaps it is!). { {Family tradition, quoted by one of his grandson&apos;s grandsons} } In 1825, having achieved the rank of Admiral, Smyth effectively retired from the Navy (Admirals never retired in those days, remaining on the Active List until death) and established a private observatory in Bedford, England, equipped with a 5.9-inch refractor telescope. He used this instrument to observe a variety of deep sky object s over the course of the 1830s, including double star s, star cluster s and nebula e. He published his observations in 1844 in the Cycle of Celestial Objects, which earned him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1845 and also the presidency of the society. The first volume of this work was on general astronomy, but the second volume became known as the Bedford Catalogue [ http://www.willbell.com/handbook/HAND1.htm The Bedford Catalog from Cycle of Celestial Objects by William H. Smyth ] and contained Smyth&apos;s observations of 1,604 double stars and nebulae. It served as a standard reference work for many years afterward; no astronomer had previously made as extensive a catalogue of dim objects such as this. It was reprinted in 1986, and in the Foreword to that edition George Lovi (astronomer and writer) [ http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993JBAA..103..201T 1993JBAA..103..201T Page 201 ] writes, &quot; What makes it so special is that it is the first true celestial Baedeker and not just another &quot; cold &quot; catalogue of mere numbers and data. Like the original Baedeker travel guidebooks of the last century, this work is full of colorful commentary on the highlights of the heavenly scene and heavily influenced several subsequent works of its type, even to the present day.... It is in the descriptive material that Smyth is a delight. He not only describes what the user of a small telescope will see, but also includes much fascinating astronomical, mythological, and historical lore. Many of these descriptions are especially valuable for the novice and user of small telescopes of a size similar to Smyth&apos;s. &quot; Having completed his observations, Smyth moved to Cardiff in 1839 to supervise the construction of the Bute Dock [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Docks#Bute_Docks Cardiff Docks - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ] which he had designed, see his Report, of which a copy is held at the Institution of Civil Engineers. His observatory was dismantled and the telescope was sold to Dr John Lee and re-erected in a new observatory of Smyth&apos;s own design at Hartwell House nearby. Smyth moved to Stone near Aylesbury in 1842, and still had the opportunity to use the telescope since his residence at St. John&apos;s Lodge was not far from its new location, and he performed a large number of additional astronomical observations from 1839 to 1859. The telescope is presently in the Science Museum, London. See his book &quot; Aedes Hartwellianae, or notices of the Mansion of Hartwell &quot; (1851), [ http://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DzlRNAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3D%22Aedes%2BHartwellianae%22%26amp%3Bsource%3Dbl%26amp%3Bots%3D214FLI7eAm%26amp%3Bsig%3D9gjWgQHswXC9c16f-CEG_ocFBKA%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bei%3DebRdTcvaMcaj8QPUp_TLCg%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Boi%3Dbook_result%26amp%3Bct%3Dresult%26amp%3Bresnum%3D1%26amp%3Bved%3D0CBYQ6AEwAA#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse ] which has illustrations by his wife Annarella née Warington, two sons - Charles Piazzi Smyth (the Astronomer-Royal for Scotland) and Captain Henry Augustus Smyth (Royal Artillery) - a daughter Ellen Philadelphia and his son-in-law, Rev. Professor Baden Powell. Latterly, he also had a house in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. Smyth was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1826.

Vice-President of the Royal Society; Founder of the United Services Institution (in 1829); Founder of the Royal Geographical Society; Director of the Society of Antiquaries; Hydrographer to the Navy; Noted astronomer; see D.N.B. As President of the Astronomical Club, he was always genial &amp; courteous, ever keeping things in happy order, and by his ready wit and flow of humour compelling the maintenance of good fellowship. He used to fill his pockets with new half-pennies to distribute to any children he met in his daily walks. Whatever he did, he did it with his might. RASoc Obituary.

He was a Fellow and, later, President (1849-51) of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1858 he began to assemble the Sailor&apos;s Word-Book from material amassed during his long career. Although he completed the work, he died before he saw its publication. And again, from the same work (re-printed in 2011):- &apos;&apos;The recent loss of Admiral William Henry Smyth, noticed as it was by the leading periodicals, will have recalled to many, not only the social character and amiable qualities of the compiler of this Work, but also his distinguished professional career and high reputation as an officer,a navigator, and a seaman, which will be a guarantee for the details of this posthumous publication.&apos;&apos; [ Bibliography ] &quot; Memoir Descriptive of the Resources, Inhabitants, and Hydrography of Sicily and Its Islands, Interspersed With Antiquarian and Other Notices &quot; 1824 &quot; The Life and Services of Captain Philip Beaver &quot; 1829 &quot; Descriptive Catalogue of a Cabinet of Roman Imperial large-brass Medals &quot; 1834 &quot; Voyages up the Mediterranean and in the Indian Seas; with memoirs, compiled from the logs and letters of W.
