Illinois was admitted to the Union on December 3, 1818, and has been represented in the United States Senate by 47 senators. Senators from Illinois are elected to Class 2 and Class 3. The Senate twice refused to seat Frank L. Smith, in December 1926 for an appointed term and in March 1927 for an elected one, due to corruption, but he is included in this list because Smith and the Governor considered him to be a senator for approximately two years. Three of the four African Americans to hold U.S. Senate seats since Reconstruction have held Illinois&apos;s Class 3 seat. [ Class 2 ] Senator Party Years Term Electoral history 1 75px Jesse B.
