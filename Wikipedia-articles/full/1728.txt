[ Amram (disambiguation) Imran (disambiguation) ] In the Book of Exodus, Amram ( [ עַמְרָם Amram ʻAmrām Friend of the most high/The people are exalted ] ) Arabic عمران Imran, is the father of Aaron, Moses, and Miriam and the husband of Jochebed. [ Exodus 6:20 ] [ In the Bible ] In addition to being married to Jochebed, Amram is also described in the Bible as having been related to Jochebed prior to the marriage, although the exact relationship is uncertain; some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Septuagint state that Jochebed was Amram&apos;s father&apos;s cousin, and others state that Amram was Jochebed&apos;s cousin, { Exodus 6:16–20, LXX - } but the Masoretic text states that he was Jochebed&apos;s nephew. { New American Bible, footnote to Exodus 6:20 } Amram&apos;s name changes to Imram later in the Bible. Textual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the Book of Generations, a document originating from a similar religiopolitical group and date to the priestly source. { Richard Elliott Friedman, Who Wrote The Bible? } According to biblical scholars, the Torah&apos;s genealogy for Levi&apos;s descendants, is actually an aetiological myth reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the levites – the Gershonite s, Kohathite s, Merarite s, and Aaronids; { Peake&apos;s commentary on the Bible } Aaron – the eponymous ancestor of the Aaronids – couldn&apos;t be portrayed as a brother to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, as the narrative about the birth of Moses (brother of Aaron), which textual scholars attribute to the earlier Elohist source, mentions only that both his parents were Levites (without identifying their names). [ Exodus 2:1–2 ] Biblical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both matrilinial and patrilinial descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses. [ In the Qur&apos;an ] Amran is arabicized to Imran. In the Qur&apos;an, the name Imran is used for two different people. The first one is Amram the father of Moses and the second one is Joachim the father of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron, is a revered patriarch of Islam. The Qur&apos;an says: [ 3 33 ns ] Although Muslim scholars have often debated over who this verse refers to, most classical commentators and modern translators have taken the opinion that this refers to Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron. Through him would come many other priests and prophet s, including Anne, Elizabeth, Mary, John the Baptist and Jesus. [ Family tree ] According to the Septuagint, Amram&apos;s family tree would be as follows: [ LEV ~ y ~ WIF BRV Levi (Unnamed) (unnamed) ] [ ! ! ] [, - - - + - - -. ! ] [ GER KOH MER JOC Gershon Kohath Merari Jochebed ] [ ! ] [, - - - v ^ - - v - - -. ] [ AMR IZH HEB UZZ Amram Izhar Hebron Uzziel ] [ ! ] [, - - - + - - -. ] [ MIR AAR MOS Miriam Aaron Moses ] while according to the Masoretic text, Amram&apos;s family tree would be as follows: [ LEV ~ y ~ WIF Levi (unnamed) ] [ ! ] [, - - - + - - - v - - -. ] [ GER KOH MER JOC Gershon Kohath Merari Jochebed ] [ ! ] [, - - - v ^ - - v - - -. ] [ AMR IZH HEB UZZ Amram Izhar Hebron Uzziel ] [ ! ] [, - - - + - - -. ] [ MIR AAR MOS Miriam Aaron Moses ] [ In rabbinical literature and apocryphal literature ] In the Apocrypha l Testament of Levi, it is stated that Amram was born, as a grandson of Levi, when Levi was 64 years old. { Testament of the Patriarchs, Levi:12 } The Exodus Rabbah argues that when the Pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the Nile, Amram divorced Jochebed, who was three months pregnant with Moses at the time, arguing that there was no justification for the Israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed; { Exodus Rabbah 1:17 } however, the text goes on to state that Miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife&apos;s feelings, persuading him to recant and marry Jochebed again. According to the Talmud, Amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the Jews in Egypt [ November 2007 ]; the Talmud also argues that Amram had extreme longevity, which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations. { Jewish Encyclopedia } Despite the legend of his divorce and remarriage, Amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life, and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay. { Baba Batra 17a } Prior to his death, according to the Book of Jubilees, Amram was among those who went to Egypt and recovered the bones of the sons of his grandfather and great uncles (excluding those of Joseph which had already been brought to Canaan), so that they could be reburied in the cave of Machpelah. { Jubilees 46:11 } The text states that this recovery was opportunistically performed when a war broke out between Egypt and Canaan. One of the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q535, Manuscript B) is written from Amram&apos;s point of view, and hence has been dubbed the Testament of Amram. The document is dated to the 2nd century BC and, in the form of a vision, briefly discusses dualism and the Watchers : [ I saw Watchers in my vision, the dream-vision. Two men were fighting over me...holding a great contest over me. I asked them, &apos;Who are you, that you are thus empowered over me?&apos; They answered, &apos;We have been empowered and rule over all mankind.&apos; They said to me, &apos;Which of us do you choose to rule you?&apos; I raised my eyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance, like a serpent, his cloak, many-colored yet very dark....And I looked again, and in his appearance, his visage like a viper....I replied to him, &apos;This Watcher, who is he?&apos; He answered, &apos;This Watcher...his three names are Belial and Prince of Darkness and King of Evil.&apos; I said (to the other Watcher), &apos;My lord, what dominion (have you?)&apos; He answered, &apos;You saw (the viper), and he is empowered over all Darkness, while I (am empowered over all Light.)...My three names are Michael, Prince of Light and King of Righteousness. translation by Prof. Robert Eisenman ] [ See also ] Aale Imran, 7 [ References ] [ August 2010 ] [ 3 Al-Baqara An-Nisa ] Category:Levites Category:Torah people Category:People of the Quran Category:Moses Category:Aaron ar:عمرام ca:Amram de:Amram el:Αμράμ es:Amram fa:عمران (پدر موسی) fr:&apos;Îmran hr:Amram id:Amram it:Amram he:עמרם nl:Amram (zoon van Kahath) pl:Amram pt:Anrão sh:Amram
