{ Copenhagen } Alternative energy is an umbrella term that refers to any source of usable energy intended to replace fuel sources without the undesired consequences of the replaced fuels. { On site renewable energy options } The term &quot; alternative &quot; presupposes a set of undesirable energy technologies against which &quot; alternative energies &quot; are contrasted. As such, the list of energy technologies excluded is an indicator of which problems the alternative technologies are intended to address. Controversies regarding dominant sources of energy and their alternatives have a long history. The nature of what was regarded alternative energy sources has changed considerably over time, and today, because of the variety of energy choices and differing goals of their advocates, defining some energy types as &quot; alternative &quot; is highly controversial. In a general sense in contemporary society, alternative energy is that which is produced without the undesirable consequences of the burning of fossil fuel s, such as high carbon dioxide emissions, which is considered to be the major contributing factor of global warming according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sometimes, this less comprehensive meaning of &quot; alternative energy &quot; excludes nuclear energy (e.g. as defined in the Michigan Next Energy Authority Act of 2002).

[ Coal as an alternative to wood ] Historian Norman F. Cantor describes how in the late medieval period, coal was the new alternative fuel to save the society from overuse of the dominant fuel, wood: [ The Civilization of the Middle Ages: The Life and Death of a Civilization Norman F. Cantor 1993 564 Harper Collins 978-0-06-092553-6 ] &quot; Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries.

This new approach should increase yields and reduce the carbon footprint because the amount of energy-intensive fertilizers and fungicides will remain the same, for a higher output of usable material. { Biofuels look to the next generation } { Cellulosic Ethanol: Not Just Any Liquid Fuel } As of 2008, there are nine commercial cellulosic ethanol plants which are either operating, or under construction, in the United States. { Building Cellulose } Second-generation biofuels technologies are able to manufacture biofuels from inedible biomass and could hence prevent conversion of food into fuel. &quot; { bioenergywiki.net:Second-generation biofuels } As of July 2010, there is one commercial second-generation (2G) ethanol plant Inbicon Biomass Refinery, which is operating in Denmark. { Inbicon - about the plant } [ Coal gasification as an alternative to petroleum ] In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter &apos;s administration advocated coal gasification as an alternative to expensive imported oil. The program, including the Synthetic Fuels Corporation was scrapped when petroleum prices plummeted in the 1980s. The carbon footprint and environmental impact of coal gasification are both very high. [ Common types of alternative energy ] [ Solar energy ] Solar energy is generating of electricity from the sun. It is split up into two types, thermal and electric energy. These two subgroups mean that they heat up homes (and water) and generate electricity respectively. [ Wind energy ] Wind energy is generating of electricity from the wind. [ Geothermal energy ] Geothermal energy is using hot water or steam from the Earth’s interior for heating buildings or electricity generation. [ Biofuel and ethanol ] Biofuel and ethanol are plant-derived substitutes of gasoline for powering vehicles. [ Hydrogen ] Hydrogen is used as clean fuel for airplanes, spaceships, and some cars. [ Renewable energy vs non-renewable energy ] [ Renewable energy ] Renewable energy is generated from natural resource s —such as sunlight, { Including } { solar and } { radiant energy. } wind, rain, tides and geothermal heat —which are renewable (naturally replenished). When comparing the processes for producing energy, there remain several fundamental differences between renewable energy and fossil fuels. The process of producing oil, coal, or natural gas fuel is a difficult and demanding process that requires a great deal of complex equipment, physical and chemical processes. On the other hand, alternative energy can be widely produced with basic equipment and naturally basic processes. Wood, the most renewable and available alternative energy, burns the same amount of carbon it would emit if it degraded naturally. { http://www.whichwoodburningstoves.co.uk } [ Ecologically friendly alternatives ] Renewable energy sources such as biomass are sometimes regarded as an alternative to ecologically harmful fossil fuels. Renewables are not inherently alternative energies for this purpose. For example, the Netherlands, once leader in use of palm oil as a biofuel, has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use &quot; may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels &quot;. [ http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/business/worldbusiness/31biofuel.html Once a Dream Fuel, Palm Oil May Be an Eco-Nightmare Elisabeth Rosenthal New York Times 2007-01-31 2008-12-14 ] The Netherlands government and environmental groups are trying to trace the origins of imported palm oil, to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner. Regarding biofuels from foodstuffs, the realization that converting the entire grain harvest of the US would only produce 16% of its auto fuel needs, and the decimation of Brazil&apos;s absorbing tropical rain forests to make way for biofuel production has made it clear that placing energy markets in competition with food markets results in higher food prices and insignificant or negative impact on energy issues such as global warming or dependence on foreign energy.

[ Relatively new concepts for alternative energy ] [ Algae fuel ] Algae fuel is a biofuel which is derived from algae. During photosynthesis, algae and other photosynthetic organisms capture carbon dioxide and sunlight and convert it into oxygen and biomass. The benefits of algal biofuel are that it can be produced industrially, thereby obviating the use of arable land and food crops (such as soy, palm, and canola), and that it has a very high oil yield as compared to all other sources of biofuel. [ Biomass briquettes ] Biomass briquettes are being developed in the developing world as an alternative to charcoal. The technique involves the conversion of almost any plant matter into compressed briquettes that typically have about 70% the calorific value of charcoal. There are relatively few examples of large scale briquette production. One exception is in North Kivu, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where forest clearance for charcoal production is considered to be the biggest threat to Mountain Gorilla habitat. The staff of Virunga National Park have successfully trained and equipped over 3500 people to produce biomass briquettes, thereby replacing charcoal produced illegally inside the national park, and creating significant employment for people living in extreme poverty in conflict affected areas.

This gas can be retrieved from garbage or sewage systems. Biogas digesters are used to process methane gas by having bacteria break down biomass in an anaerobic environment. [ 27 March 2009 http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/RENEW/Biomass/biogas.shtml Biogas Technology 24 June 2009 ] The methane gas that is collected and refined can be used as an energy source for various products. [ Biological Hydrogen Production ] Hydrogen gas is a completely clean burning fuel; its only by-product is water. { Hijikata, Tsuneo. 2001. Research and Development of International Clean Energy Network Using Hydrogen Energy. International Journal of Hydrogen Energy; 27: 115-129 } It also contains relatively high amount of energy compared with other fuels due to its chemical structure. { P. 12, BMW Group Clean Energy ZEV Symposium, September 2006 } 2H 2 + O 2 → 2H 2 O + High Energy High Energy + 2H 2 O → 2H 2 + O 2 This requires a high-energy input, making commercial hydrogen very inefficient. [ Ghirardi ML, Togasaki RK, Seibert M Oxygen Sensitivity of Algal H 2 -Production Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology 63 141–51 1997 10.1007/BF02920420 18576077 ] Use of a biological vector as a means to split water, and therefore produce hydrogen gas, would allow for the only energy input to be solar radiation. Biological vectors can include bacteria or more commonly algae. This process is known as biological hydrogen production. [ Radmer R, Kok B Photosynthesis: Limited Yields, Unlimited Dreams BioScience 29 599–605 1977 ] It requires the use of single celled organisms to create hydrogen gas through fermentation. Without the presence of oxygen, also known as an anaerobic environment, regular cellular respiration cannot take place and a process known as fermentation takes over. A major by-product of this process is hydrogen gas. If we could implement this on a large scale, then we could take sunlight, nutrients and water and create hydrogen gas to be used as a dense source of energy. [ Gaffron H, Rubin J Fermentative and Photochemical Production of Hydrogen in Algae Journal of General Physiology 26 219–240 1942 10.1085/jgp.26.2.219 19873339 2 2142062 ] Large-scale production has proven difficult. It was not until 1999 that we were able to even induce these anaerobic conditions by sulfur deprivation. [ Melis A, Neidhardt J, Benemann JR Dunaliella salina(Chlorophyta) with Small Chlorophyll Antenna Sizes Exhibit Higher Photosynthetic Productivities and Photon Use Efficiencies Than Normally Pigmented Cells Journal of Applied Physiology 10 515–52 1999 ] Since the fermentation process is an evolutionary back up, turned on during stress, the cells would die after a few days. In 2000, a two-stage process was developed to take the cells in and out of anaerobic conditions and therefore keep them alive.

Offshore wind farms can be placed in water up to [ 40 m ] deep, whereas floating wind turbines can float in water up to [ 700 m ] deep. [ Horton, Jennifer. 19 August 2008 http://science.howstuffworks.com/five-forms-alternative-energy.htm 5 Wacky Forms of Alternative Energy 15 June 2009 ] The advantage of having a floating wind farm is to be able to harness the winds from the open ocean.

Hywind by Statoil 24 June 2009 ] [ Investing in alternative energy ] Over the last three years publicly traded alternative energy have been very volatile, with some 2007 returns in excess of 100%, some 2008 returns down 90% or more, and peak-to-trough returns in 2009 again over 100%. [ September 2009 ] In general there are three subsegments of “alternative” energy investment: solar energy, wind energy and hybrid electric vehicles. Alternative energy sources which are renewable, free and have lower carbon emissions than what we have now are wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, and bio fuels. Each of these four segments involve very different technologies and investment concerns. For example, photovoltaic solar energy is based on semiconductor processing and accordingly, benefits from steep cost reductions similar to those realized in the microprocessor industry (i.e., driven by larger scale, higher module efficiency, and improving processing technologies). PV solar energy is perhaps the only energy technology whose electricity generation cost could be reduced by half or more over the next 5 years. Better and more efficient manufacturing process and new technology such as advanced thin film solar cell is a good example of that helps to reduce industry cost. { http://electronicdesign.com/article/power/is-solar-energy-really-ready-to-rumble-19153.aspx } The economics of solar PV electricity are highly dependent on silicon pricing and even companies whose technologies are based on other materials (e.g., First Solar) are impacted by the balance of supply and demand in the silicon market. [ September 2009 ] In addition, because some companies sell completed solar cells on the open market (e.g., Q-Cells), this creates a low barrier to entry for companies that want to manufacture solar modules, which in turn can create an irrational pricing environment. In contrast, because wind power has been harnessed for over 100 years, its underlying technology is relatively stable. Its economics are largely determined by siting (e.g., how hard the wind blows and the grid investment requirements) and the prices of steel (the largest component of a wind turbine) and select composites (used for the blades). Because current wind turbines are often in excess of 100 meters high, logistics and a global manufacturing platform are major sources of competitive advantage. These issues and others were explored in a research report by Sanford Bernstein. Some of its key conclusions are shown here.

For example, electric vehicle s (EV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle s (PHEV) are on the rise. These vehicles depend heavily on an effective charging infrastructure such as a smart grid infrastructure to be able to implement electricity as mainstream alternative energy for future transportations. { http://electronicdesign.com/article/power/electric_vehicles_the_smart_grid_s_moving_target.aspx } [ September 2010 ] [ Alternative Energy Research ] There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of alternative energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the alternative energy spectrum.

This oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels, with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol. The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture— unlike food crop-based biofuels — does not entail a decrease in food production, since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water. Many companies are pursuing algae bio-reactors for various purposes, including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels.

Develops “Clean Green” Vertical Bio-Reactor 2008-07-09 Valcent Products ] [ http://www.greenfuelonline.com/technology.htm Technology: High Yield Carbon Recycling 2008-07-09 GreenFuel Technologies Corporation ] Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on Jatropha curcas, a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil. [ Biology and genetic improvement of Jatropha curcas L.: A review Applied Energy 87 3 2010 732-742 B.N. Divakara, H.D. Upadhyaya, S.P. Wani, C.L. Laxmipathi Gowda 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.07.013 ] Much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of Jatropha through advancements in genetics, soil science, and horticultural practices. SG Biofuels, a San Diego-based Jatropha developer, has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds of Jatropha that show significant yield improvements over first generation varieties.

It is considered sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished. [ Geothermal Sustainability GHC Bulletin 2007 2-6 L. Ryback ] However, the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability. Several entities, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory [ NREL http://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/ Geothermal Technologies NREL 2012-04-17 ] and Sandia National Laboratories [ Sandia http://energy.sandia.gov/index.php?page_id%3D381 Geothermal Sandia 2012-04-17 ] are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy. The International Centre for Geothermal Research (IGC), a German geosciences research organization, is largely focused on geothermal energy development research. [ GFZ Helmholtz Center Potsdam http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/Struktur/GeoEngineering-Zentren/Internationales%2BGeothermiezentrum%3Bjsessionid%3D8F6BF49D51E1BAA8273B58EAEEA40F41 International Centre for Geothermal Research GFZ Helmholtz Center Potsdam 2012-04-17 ] [ Hydrogen ] [ Hydrogen Fuel ] Over $1 billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the United States. [ Jeff Wise http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/next-generation/4199381 The Truth about hydrogen Popular Mechanics 2012-04-17 ] Both the National Renewable Energy Laboratory [ NREL http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/ Hydrogen NREL 2012-04-17 ] and Sandia National Laboratories [ Sandia http://www.sandia.gov/hydrogen Hydrogen Sandia 2012-04-17 ] have departments dedicated to hydrogen research. [ Disadvantages ] There are a number of issues that may arise from switching to alternative energy. “Increasing the nation’s use of natural gas for electricity generation could result in adverse economic consequences”, especially since “natural gas currently costs about four times more than coal”. { The US Senate and House of Representatives. (2008). “Economic and Other Implications of Switching from Coal to Natural Gas at the Capitol Power Plant and at Electricity-Generating Units Nationwide”. United States Government Accountability Office. Washington, DC } Furthermore, if there were a widespread switching to natural gas from coal some countries would become increasingly dependent on international supplies. Also, “large-scale fuel switching would require substantial investments in pipeline storage and storage capacity and new terminals to process imported natural gas”. There is also the question of whether to convert existing coal-burning plants or to construct new ones. “Burning natural gas at an existing coal plant would require a pipeline with the ability to meet the plant’s fuel supply requirements”. It would also require “expansion of interstate and intrastate pipelines to transport increased volumes of natural gas” Overall it would be more feasible and cost-effective to construct new natural gas units than to switch coal-burning plants.
