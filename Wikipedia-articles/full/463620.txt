[ March 2008 ] The poisoned candy myths are urban legend s that malevolent individuals could hide razor blades, needles, drugs, or poison in candy and distribute the candy in order to harm random children, especially during Halloween trick-or-treating. Only one incident of deliberate Halloween candy poisoning has been recorded--a father poisoned candy to murder his own child. [ http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/halloween.asp Halloween Poisonings snopes.com 2009-07-16 ] [ Development of the candy tampering myth ] Several events fostered the candy tampering myth. The first event took place in 1964, where an annoyed Long Island, New York housewife started giving out packages of inedible objects to children whom she believed were too old to be trick-or-treating. The packages contained items such as steel wool, dog biscuit s, and ant buttons (which were clearly labeled with the word ”poison”). Though nobody was injured, she was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to endangering children. The same year saw reports of lye -filled bubble gum being handed out in Detroit and rat poison being given in Philadelphia. [ Deadly &apos;Tricks&apos; Given Children in 3 States United Press International The Milwaukee Journal November 2, 1964 A18 ] The second milestone in the spread of the candy tampering myths was an article published in the New York Times in 1970. This article claimed that &quot; Those Halloween goodies that children collect this weekend on their rounds of ‘trick or treating’ may bring them more horror than happiness &quot;, and provided specific examples of potential tamperings. [ Those Treats May Be Tricks Judy Klemesrud The New York Times October 28, 1970 56 ] In 2008, candy was found with metal shavings and metal blades embedded in it. The candy was Pokémon Valentine&apos;s Day lollipop s purchased from a Dollar General store in Polk County, Florida. The candy was determined to have been manufactured in China and not tampered with within the United States. The lollipops were pulled from the shelves after a mother reported a blade in her child&apos;s lollipop and after several more lollipops with metal shavings in them were confiscated from a local elementary school.

Among this group is Joel Best, a University of Delaware sociologist who specializes in candy tampering legends. In his studies he researched newspaper s from 1958 on in search of candy tampering. Of these stories fewer than 90 instances might have qualified. Upon closer examination nearly all of these claims were false or hoax es created by the child. Within the reports of candy tampering Best has only found five child death s that were initially thought to be caused by homicidal strangers. In 1970, a 5-year-old boy from the Detroit area found and ate heroin his uncle had stashed. The boy died following a four day coma. The family attempted to protect the uncle by claiming the drug had been sprinkled in the child&apos;s Halloween candy. { Carroll, Aaron &amp; Rachel Vreeman (2009).

ISBN 978-0-312-53387-8. } In a 1974 case, Timothy O&apos;Bryan, an 8-year-old boy from Deer Park, Texas, died after eating a cyanide -laced package of Pixy Stix. A subsequent police investigation eventually determined that the poisoned candy had been planted in his trick-or-treat pile by the boy&apos;s father, Ronald Clark O&apos;Bryan, who also gave out poisoned candy to other children in an attempt to cover up the murder. The murderer, who had wanted to claim life insurance money, was executed in 1984. { Texas Department of Criminal Justice } [ Media and the myth ] Despite the falsity of these claims the news media promoted the story continuously throughout the 1980s, with local news stations featuring frequent coverage. During this time cases of poisoning were repeatedly reported based on unsubstantiated claims or before a full investigation could be completed and often never followed up on. This one sided coverage contributed to the overall panic and caused rival media outlets to issue reports of candy tampering as well. By 1985, the media had driven the hysteria about candy poisonings to such a point that an ABC News/Washington Post poll that found 60% of parents feared that their child ren would be injured or killed because of Halloween candy sabotage. Advice columnists entered the fray during the 1980s and 1990s with both Ann Landers and Dear Abby warning parents of the horrors of candy tampering. &quot; In recent years, there have been reports of people with twisted minds putting razor blades and poison in taffy apples and Halloween candy. It is no longer safe to let your child eat treats that come from strangers. &quot; –Ann Landers Landers, Ann (October 31, 1995). &quot; Twisted Minds Make Halloween a Dangerous Time &quot;. The Sunday Courier, 7B. Retrieved on November 2, 2009. &quot; Somebody&apos;s child will become violently ill or die after eating poisoned candy or an apple containing a razor blade. &quot; –Dear Abby Van Buren, Abigail (October 31, 1983). &quot; A Night of Treats, Not Tricks &quot;. Gainsville Sun, 13A. Retrieved November 2, 2009. This collective fear also served as the impetus for the &quot; safe &quot; trick-or-treating offered by many local mall s.
