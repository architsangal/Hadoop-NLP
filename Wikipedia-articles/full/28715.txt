It consists of Serj Tankian (lead vocals, keyboards, rhythm guitar), Daron Malakian (guitar, vocals), Shavo Odadjian (bass, background vocals) and John Dolmayan (drums). The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums; from which three debuted at number one on the &apos;&apos;Billboard&apos;&apos; 200. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, and won the award in 2006 for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song &quot; B.Y.O.B. &quot;. The group went on hiatus in August 2006, but reunited in November 2010, embarking on a worldwide tour in 2011. [ History ] [ Soil (1992–1994) ] Serj Tankian, Daron Malakian, and Shavo Odadjian all attended Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School while children, although because of their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio. { Meyers, Ben. System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood (2007), p.  14. } They formed a band named Soil with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan (who later played in The Apex Theory / Mt. Helium ) on bass and Domingo &quot; Dingo &quot; Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian (another Rose and Alex Pilibos alumnus) as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as rhythm guitarist. After three years, only one live show, and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio quit the band, feeling that it was not going anywhere. [ Demo tapes and signing (1994–1997) ] After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled “Victims of the Down. &quot; [ http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction%3Dblog.view%26amp%3BfriendId%3D512654515%26amp%3BblogId%3D526325472 OnTroniK: System of a Down Information July 18, 2010 ] The word &quot; victims &quot; was changed to &quot; system &quot; because Odadjian believed that the alteration would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, Slayer. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group and its founder David “Beno” Benveniste. [ March 2010 ] The band recruited drummer Ontronik &quot; Andy &quot; Khachaturian, an old school friend of Malakian&apos;s and Odadjian&apos;s who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens. System of a Down quickly made what is known as Untitled 1995 Demo Tape, which was not commercially released but appeared on file sharing networks around the time of the band&apos;s success with Toxicity about six years later. Demo Tape 2 was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, Demo Tape 3. In mid 1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan). Khachaturian was replaced by John Dolmayan. The band&apos;s first official release of a professionally recorded song was on a collection called Hye Enk ( &quot; we&apos;re Armenian &quot; in English), an Armenian Genocide recognition compilation, in 1997. Soon after playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the Whisky-A-Go-Go and Viper Room the band caught famed producer Rick Rubin &apos;s attention who asked them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, the group recorded Demo Tape 4 near the end of 1997. Unlike the previous demo tapes, however, Demo Tape 4 was made only to be sent to record companies (although it has since been leaked onto the internet). Rubin signed the group onto his American/Columbia Records, and System of a Down began to record in Rubin&apos;s studio, laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album. Also in 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards. [ Rock City Awards 1997 rockcitynews.com http://www.rockcitynews.com/awards/ballot97.html July 25, 2007 ] [ Debut album (1998–2000) ] In June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, System of a Down. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles &quot; Sugar &quot; and &quot; Spiders &quot; became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and Metallica before making their way to the second stage of Ozzfest. Following Ozzfest, they toured with Fear Factory and Incubus before headlining the Sno-Core Tour with Puya, Mr. Bungle, The Cat and Incubus providing support. In November 1998, System of a Down appeared on South Park &apos;s Chef Aid album, providing the music for the song &quot; Will They Die 4 You? &quot; Near the end of the song Tankian can be heard saying, &quot; Why must we kill our own kind? &quot; a line that would later be used in the song &quot; Boom! &quot; Although System of a Down is credited on the album, South Park character Chef doesn&apos;t introduce them as he does for all other artist featured on the record. System of a Down&apos;s former drummer, Ontronik Khachaturian, briefly reunited with the band at a show at The Troubadour in 1999, filling in on vocals for an ill Tankian. In 2000, the band contributed their cover of the Black Sabbath song &quot; Snowblind &quot; to the Black Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black 2. [ Toxicity and Steal This Album! (2001–2003) ] { Daron Malakian met Serj Tankian for the first time in 1993 before forming the band a year later. } On September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a &quot; thank you &quot; to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people, however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans the performance was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read &quot; System of a Down &quot; was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band&apos;s touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band&apos;s manager, David &quot; Beno &quot; Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Down&apos;s scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot. [ http://www.livedaily.com/news/3600.html System Of A Down cancellation sparks riot September 4, 2001 Live Daily July 20, 2010 ] The group&apos;s big break arrived when their second album Toxicity debuted at No.1 on the American and Canadian charts, despite the events of September 11. The album eventually achieved multi-platinum certification [ March 2010 ] and has since sold over 12 million copies worldwide. [ March 2010 ] It was still on top in America during the week of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding the album&apos;s hit single &quot; Chop Suey! &quot; The song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics at the time such as &quot; (I don&apos;t think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide. &quot; Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album&apos;s second single, &quot; Toxicity &quot;. Even with the controversy surrounding &quot; Chop Suey! &quot; (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with &quot; Toxicity &quot; and &quot; Aerials &quot;. In May 2006, VH1 listed Toxicity in the No.14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs. In 2001, the band went on tour with Slipknot throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.

In late 2001, unreleased tracks from the Toxicity sessions made their way onto the internet. [ http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html The Daron Malakian Interview Mike Lancaster March 28, 2003 Glendale High School Newspaper-the Explosion July 26, 2010 ] This collection of tracks was dubbed Toxicity II by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, Steal This Album!, which was released in November 2002. Steal This Album! resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to Abbie Hoffman &apos;s counter-culture book, Steal This Book as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the internet. The song &quot; Innervision &quot; was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for &quot; Boom! &quot; was filmed with director Michael Moore as a protest against the War in Iraq. [ Mezmerize and Hypnotize (2004–2006) ] { Serj Tankian has gained reputation for his large vocal range along with his unusual vocal tactics. } Between 2004 to 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to Steal This Album!, a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart from each other, notably including album cover artwork by Malakian&apos;s father, Vartan Malakian, which was designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, Mezmerize, was released on May 17, 2005 to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No.1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of A Down&apos;s second No.1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single &quot; B.Y.O.B. &quot;, which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single, &quot; Question! &quot; was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of Mezmerize, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with The Mars Volta and Bad Acid Trip supporting. The second part of the double album, Hypnotize, was released on November 22, 2005. Like Mezmerize, it debuted at No.1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with The Beatles, Guns &apos;N Roses, and rappers 2Pac and DMX, the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No.1 in the same year.

Their second single off the Hypnotize album, &quot; Lonely Day &quot; was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released &quot; Kill Rock &apos;N Roll &quot; and &quot; Vicinity of Obscenity &quot; as their next promo singles. The band headlined Ozzfest 2006 in cities where tour founder Ozzy Osbourne opted not to appear or wasn&apos;t playing on the main stage. Whereas on System of a Down&apos;s previous albums most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian (and sometimes Odadjian) much of the music and lyrics on Mezmerize/Hypnotize were written by Malakian who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals. Concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the Armenian Genocide were featured in the 2006 film Screamers, directed by Carla Garapedian. An interview with Tankian&apos;s grandfather, a survivor of the Genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian&apos;s and Dolmayan&apos;s meeting with (then) Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government&apos;s official recognition of the Genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside of the Turkish embassy in Washington D.C. was also used in Screamers. System of a Down was honored at a University of Southern California game at the Los Angeles Coliseum in Los Angeles, California in 2006. The Trojan Marching Band, along with Dolmayan and Odadjian, performed three System of a Down songs: &quot; Toxicity, &quot; &quot; Sugar, &quot; and &quot; Hypnotize. &quot; System of a Down&apos;s song &quot; Lonely Day &quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the 49th Grammy Awards in 2007, but lost to &quot; Woman &quot; by Wolfmother. In May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with Guitar magazine. He told MTV, &quot; We&apos;re not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn&apos;t be doing this Ozzfest. We&apos;re going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We&apos;ve done System for over ten years, and I think it&apos;s healthy to take some rest. &quot; [ http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1530066/20060503/system_of_a_down.jhtml System of a Down Aren&apos;t Breaking Up—They&apos;re Going on Hiatus Harris Chris May 3, 2006 MTV News February 2, 2009 ] May 2006 also saw the UK publication of a biography of the band entitled System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood by writer Ben Myers.
