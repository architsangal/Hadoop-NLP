[ the 1990 German reunification the 1871 German Empire Unification of Germany ] { East and } { West Germany, with } { West Berlin in yellow. } German reunification ( [ no Deutsche Wiedervereinigung ] ) was the process in 1990 in which the German Democratic Republic (GDR/East Germany) joined the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG/West Germany), and when Berlin reunited into a single city, as provided by its then Grundgesetz constitution Article 23. The start of this process is commonly referred by Germans as die Wende (The Turning Point). The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity ( [ no Deutsche Einheit ] ), celebrated on 3 October ( German Unity Day ). { Vertrag zwischen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik über die Herstellung der Einheit Deutschlands (Einigungsvertrag) Unification Treaty signed by the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic in Berlin on 31 August 1990 (official text, in German). } The East German regime started to falter in May 1989, when the removal of Hungary&apos;s border fence opened a hole in the Iron Curtain. It caused an exodus of thousands of East Germans fleeing to West Germany and Austria via Hungary. The Peaceful Revolution, a series of protests by East Germans, led to the GDR&apos;s first free elections on 18 March 1990, and to the negotiations between the GDR and FRG that culminated in a Unification Treaty, whilst negotiations between the GDR and FRG and the four occupying powers produced the so-called &quot; Two Plus Four Treaty &quot; ( Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany ) granting full sovereignty to a unified German state, whose two parts had previously still been bound by a number of limitations stemming from their post-WWII status as occupied regions. The united Germany remained a member of the European Community (later the European Union ) and of NATO. [ Naming ] There is debate as to whether the events of 1990 should be properly referred to as a &quot; reunification &quot; or a &quot; unification &quot;. Proponents [ November 2010 ] of the former use the term in contrast with the initial unification of Germany in 1871. Also when the Saarland joined the West German Federal Republic of Germany on 1 January 1957, this was termed the Small Reunification. Popular parlance, which uses &quot; reunification &quot;, is deeply affected by the 1989 opening of the Berlin Wall (and the rest of the inner German border ) and the physical reunification of the city of Berlin (itself divided only since 1945). Others, [ November 2010 ] however, argue that 1990 represented a &quot; unification &quot; of two German states into a larger entity which, in its resulting form, had never before existed (see History of Germany ). For political and diplomatic reasons, West German politicians carefully avoided the term &quot; reunification &quot; during the run-up to what Germans frequently refer to as die Wende. The official and most common term in German is &quot; Deutsche Einheit &quot; (in English &quot; German unity &quot; ). German unity is the term that Hans-Dietrich Genscher used in front of international journalists to correct them when they asked him about &quot; reunification &quot; in 1990. After 1990, the term &quot; die Wende &quot; became more common. The term generally refers to the events (mostly in Eastern Europe) that led up to the actual reunification; in its usual context, this term loosely translates to &quot; the turning point &quot;, without any further meaning. When referring to the events surrounding unification, however, it carries the cultural connotation of the time and the events in the GDR that brought about this &quot; turnaround &quot; in German history. However, civil rights activists from Eastern Germany rejected the term Wende as it was introduced by SED&apos;s Secretary General Egon Krenz. { Krenz speech of 18 October 1989 in the German radio archive } [ Precursors to reunification ] [ Iron Curtain#Fall of the Iron Curtain Revolutions of 1989 Dissolution of the Soviet Union European integration ] In 1945, the Third Reich ended in defeat and Germany was divided into two separate countries, with the east controlled as part of the Communist Soviet Bloc and the west aligned to Capitalist Europe (which formed into the European Community ), including a division in military alliance that formed into the Warsaw Pact and NATO, respectively. The capital city of Berlin was divided into four occupied sectors of control, under the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and France. Germans lived under such imposed divisions throughout the ensuing Cold War. Into the 1980s, the Soviet Union experienced a period of economic and political stagnation, and they correspondingly decreased intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. In 1987, US President Ronald Reagan gave a speech at Brandenburg Gate challenging Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to &quot; tear down this wall &quot; that had separated Berlin. The wall had stood as an icon for the political and economic division between East and West, a division that Churchill had referred to as the &quot; Iron Curtain &quot;. In early 1989, under a new era of Soviet policies of glasnost (openness), perestroika (economic restructuring) and taken to even more progressive levels by Gorbachev, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. Further inspired by other images of brave defiance, a wave of revolutions swept throughout the Eastern Bloc that year. In May 1989, Hungary removed their border fence and thousands of East Germans escaped to the West. The turning point in Germany, called &quot; Die Wende &quot;, was marked by the &quot; Peaceful Revolution &quot; leading to the removal of the Berlin Wall with East and West Germany subsequently entering into negotiations toward eliminating the division that had been imposed upon Germans more than four decades earlier. [ Process of reunification ] { Volkspolizei wait for the official opening of the } { Brandenburg Gate on 22 December 1989. } On 28 November 1989—two weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall—West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced a 10-point program calling for the two Germanies to expand their cooperation with the view toward eventual reunification. { Helmut Kohl&apos;s 10-Point Plan for German Unity } Initially, no timetable was proposed. However, events rapidly came to a head in early 1990. First, in March, the Party of Democratic Socialism —the former Socialist Unity Party of Germany —was heavily defeated in East Germany&apos;s first free elections. A grand coalition was formed under Lothar de Maizière, leader of the East German wing of Kohl&apos;s Christian Democratic Union, on a platform of speedy reunification. Second, East Germany&apos;s economy and infrastructure underwent a swift and near-total collapse. While East Germany had long been reckoned as having the most robust economy in the Soviet bloc, the removal of Communist discipline revealed the ramshackle foundations of that system. The East German mark had been practically worthless outside of East Germany for some time before the events of 1989–90, further magnifying the problem. Discussions immediately began for an emergency merger of the Germanies&apos; economies. On 18 May 1990, the two German states signed a treaty agreeing on monetary, economic and social union. This came into force on 1 July 1990, with the Deutsche Mark replacing the East German mark as the official currency of East Germany. The Deutsche Mark had a very high reputation among the East Germans and was considered stable. { German Unification Monetary union. Cepr.org (1 July 1990). Retrieved on 19 October 2010. } While the GDR transferred its financial policy sovereignty to West Germany, the West started granting subsidies for the GDR budget and social security system. { Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany London – A short history of German reunification. London.diplo.de. Retrieved on 19 October 2010. } At the same time many West German laws came into force in the GDR. This created a suitable framework for a political union by diminishing the huge gap between the two existing political, social, and economic systems. A reunification treaty between West Germany and the GDR was negotiated in mid-1990, signed on 31 August of that year and finally approved by large majorities in the legislative chambers of both countries on 20 September 1990. { Opening of the Berlin Wall and Unification: German History. Germanculture.com.ua. Retrieved on 19 October 2010. } The amendments to the Federal Republic&apos;s Basic Law that were foreseen in the Unification Treaty or necessary for its implementation were adopted by the Federal Statute of 23 September 1990. After that last step Germany was officially united at 00:00 CET on 3 October 1990. East Germany joined the Federal Republic as the five states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. These states had been the five original states of East Germany, but had been abolished in 1952 in favour of a centralised system. As part of the 18 May treaty, the five East German states had been reconstituted on 23 August. At the same time, East and West Berlin reunited into one city, which became a city-state along the lines of the existing city-states of Bremen and Hamburg. The process chosen was one of two options implemented in the West German constitution ( Basic Law ) of 1949. Via that document&apos;s (then-existing) Article 23, any new Länder (German federative states), could adhere to the Basic Law by a simple majority vote. Thus the states&apos; parliaments would vote in for their adhesion. The initial eleven joining states of 1949 comprised the Trizone and West Berlin. However the latter was legally inhibited by Allied objection due to the status of the city as a quadripartite allied occupation area. { However, in many fields it functioned de facto as if it were a component State of West Germany. } In 1957 the Saar Protectorate joined West Germany under the Article 23 procedure as Saarland. As the five refounded eastern German states formally joined the Federal Republic using the Article 23 procedure, the area in which the Basic Law was in force simply extended to include them. { Germany Today – The German Unification Treaty – travel and tourist information, flight reservations, travel bargains, hotels, resorts, car hire. Europe-today.com. Retrieved on 19 October 2010. } The alternative would have been for East Germany to join as a whole along the lines of a formal union between two German states that then would have had to, amongst other things, create a new constitution for the newly established country. Under the model that was chosen, however, the territory of the former German Democratic Republic was simply incorporated into the Federal Republic of Germany, and accordingly the Federal Republic of Germany, now enlarged to include the Eastern States, continued legally to exist under the same legal personality that was founded in May 1949. Thus, the reunification was not a merger that created a third state out of the two, but an incorporation, by which West Germany absorbed East Germany. Thus, on Unification Day, 3 October 1990, the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist, giving way to five new Federal States, and East and West Berlin were also unified as a single city-state, forming a sixth new Federal State. The new Federal States immediately became parts of the Federal Republic of Germany, so that it was enlarged to include the whole territory of the former East Germany and Berlin. The practical result of that model is that the now expanded Federal Republic of Germany continued to be a party to all the treaties it had signed prior to the moment of reunification, and thus continued the same membership of the U.N., NATO, the European Communities, etc.; also, the same Basic Law and the same laws that were in force in the Federal Republic continued automatically in force, but now applied to the expanded territory. To facilitate this process and to reassure other countries, some changes were made to the &quot; Basic Law &quot; (constitution). Article 146 was amended so that Article 23 of the current constitution could be used for reunification. After the five &quot; New Länder &quot; of East Germany had joined, the constitution was amended again to indicate that all parts of Germany are now unified. Article 23 was rewritten and it can still be understood as an invitation to others (e.g. Austria) to join, although the main idea of the change was to calm fears in (for example) Poland, that Germany would later try to rejoin with former eastern territories of Germany that were now Polish or parts of other countries in the East. The changes effectively formalised the Oder-Neisse line as Germany&apos;s permanent eastern border. These amendments to the Basic Law were mandated by Article I, section 4 of the Two Plus Four Treaty. [ http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AZwei-Plus-Vier-Vertrag.pdf File:Zwei-Plus-Vier-Vertrag.pdf ] While the Basic Law was modified rather than replaced by a constitution as such, it still permits the adoption of a formal constitution by the German people at some time in the future. To commemorate the day that marks the official unification of the former East and West Germany in 1990, 3 October has since then been the official German national holiday, the Day of German Unity (Tag der deutschen Einheit). It replaced the previous national holiday held in West Germany on 17 June commemorating the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany and the national holiday on 7 October in the GDR. [ Foreign opposition ] For decades, Germany&apos;s allies had stated their support for reunification; Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who speculated that a country that &quot; decided to kill millions of Jewish people &quot; in the Holocaust &quot; will try to do it again &quot;, was one of the few world leaders to publicly oppose it. As reunification became a realistic possibility, however, significant NATO and European opposition emerged in private.

[ wiegrefe20100929 ] Thatcher, who carried in her handbag a map of Germany&apos;s 1937 borders to show others the &quot; German problem &quot;, feared that its &quot; national character &quot;, size, and central location in Europe would cause the nation to be a &quot; destabilizing rather than a stabilizing force in Europe &quot;.

[ wiegrefe20100929 ] Thatcher favoured a transition period of five years for reunification, during which the two Germanys would remain separate states. Although she gradually softened her opposition, as late as March 1990 Thatcher summoned historians and diplomats to a seminar at Chequers [ kundnani20091028 ] to ask &quot; How dangerous are the Germans? &quot; [ volkery20091109 ] and the French ambassador in London reported that Thatcher had told him, &quot; France and Great Britain should pull together today in the face of the German threat. &quot; [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/6480413/Margaret-Thatcher-was-horrified-by-the-prospect-of-a-reunited-Germany.html Peter Allen Telegraph Margaret Thatcher was &apos;horrified&apos; by the prospect of a reunited Germany 2 November 2009 9 November 2009 London ] Similarly, a representative of French President François Mitterrand reportedly told an aide to Gorbachev, &quot; France by no means wants German reunification, although it realises that in the end it is inevitable. &quot; At the Strasbourg summit, Mitterrand and Thatcher discussed the fluidity of Germany&apos;s historical borders.

[ wiegrefe20100929 ] Mitterrand recognized before Thatcher that reunification was inevitable and adjusted his views accordingly; unlike her, he was hopeful that participation in a single currency [ kundnani20091028 ] and other European institutions could control a united Germany.

[ volkery20091109 ] [ The rest of Europe ] Other European leaders&apos; opinion of reunification was &quot; icy &quot;. Italy&apos;s Giulio Andreotti warned against a revival of &quot; pan-Germanism &quot;, and the Netherlands&apos; Ruud Lubbers questioned the German right to self-determination. They shared Britain and France&apos;s concerns over a return to German militarism and the economic power of a reunified nation. The consensus opinion was that reunification, if it must occur, should not occur until at least 1995 and preferably much later.

The Soviet Union sought early to use reunification as a way to push Germany out of NATO into neutrality, removing nuclear weapons from its territory. West Germany interpreted a 21 November 1989 diplomatic message on the topic, however, as meaning that only two weeks after the Wall&apos;s collapse the Soviet leadership already anticipated reunification. This belief, and the worry that his rival Genscher might act first, encouraged Kohl on 28 November to announce a detailed reunification plan ( 10-Point Plan ). While his speech was very popular within West Germany Kohl&apos;s speech caused concern among other European governments, with whom he had not discussed the plan. [ wiegrefe20100929 ] The Americans did not share the Europeans&apos; and Russians&apos; historical fears over German expansionism, but wished to ensure that Germany would stay within NATO. In December 1989, the administration of President George H. W. Bush made a united Germany&apos;s continued NATO membership a requirement for supporting reunification. Kohl agreed, although less than 20% of West Germans supported remaining within NATO; he also wished to avoid a neutral Germany, as he believed that would destroy NATO, cause the United States and Canada to leave Europe, and Britain and France would form an alliance. The United States increased its support of Kohl&apos;s policies, as it feared that otherwise Oskar Lafontaine, a critic of NATO, might become Chancellor. [ wiegrefe20100929 ] { Helmut Kohl became first chancellor of a reunified Germany. } Horst Teltschik, Kohl&apos;s foreign policy advisor, later recalled that Germany would have paid &quot; 100 billion deutschmarks &quot; had the Soviets demanded it. The USSR did not make such great demands, however, with Gorbachev stating in February 1990 that &quot; The Germans must decide for themselves what path they choose to follow &quot;. In May 1990 he repeated his remark in the context of NATO membership while meeting Bush, amazing both the Americans and Germans. [ wiegrefe20100929 ] [ Conclusion ] During a NATO-Warsaw Pact conference in Ottawa, Canada, Genscher persuaded the four powers to treat the two Germanys as equals instead of defeated junior partners, and for the six nations to negotiate alone. Although the Dutch, Italians, Spanish, and other NATO powers opposed such a structure, which meant that the alliance&apos;s boundaries would change without their participation, the six nations began negotiations in March 1990. After Gorbachev&apos;s May agreement on German NATO membership, the Soviets further agreed that Germany would be treated as an ordinary NATO country, with the exception that former East German territory would not have foreign NATO troops or nuclear weapons. In exchange, Kohl agreed to reduce the sizes of both Germanys&apos; militaries, renounce weapons of mass destruction, and accept the postwar Oder-Neisse line as Germany&apos;s eastern border. In addition, Germany agreed to pay about 55 billion deutschmarks to the Soviet Union in gifts and loans, the equivalent of eight days of the West German GDP.

Thatcher later wrote that her opposition to reunification had been an &quot; unambiguous failure &quot;. [ kundnani20091028 ] [ Aftermath ] On 14 November 1990, the united Germany and Poland signed the German–Polish Border Treaty, finalizing Germany&apos;s boundaries as permanent along the Oder-Neisse line, and thus, renouncing any claims to Silesia, East Brandenburg, Farther Pomerania, and territories of the former province of East Prussia. { The territory of the } { League of Nations mandate of the } { Free City of Danzig, annexed by Poland in 1945 and comprising the city of } { Gdańsk (Danzig) and a number of neighbouring cities and municipalities, had never been claimed by any official side, because West Germany followed the legal position of Germany in its borders of 1937, thus before any Nazi annexations. } The treaty also granted certain rights for political minorities on either side of the border. { Poland Germany border – Oder Neisse.

On 15 March 1991, the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany entered into force, putting an end to the remaining limitations on German sovereignty that resulted from the post WWII arrangements. [ Inner reunification ] [ New federal states ] Vast differences between the former East Germany and West Germany (for example, in lifestyle, wealth, political beliefs and other matters) remain, and it is therefore still common to speak of eastern and western Germany distinctly. The eastern German economy has struggled since unification, and large subsidies are still transferred from west to east. The former East Germany area has often been compared to the underdeveloped Southern Italy and the Southern United States during Reconstruction after the American Civil War. While the East German economy has recovered recently, the differences between East and West remain constant. { Underestimating East Germany – Magazine. The Atlantic (15 October 2010).

[ Schwedler Hanns-Uve Divided cities - planning for unification. http://www.eaue.de/vortrag/Berlin-e.HTM European Academy of the Urban Environment 14 May 2012 ] The two political systems allocated funds differently to post-war reconstruction, based on political priorities, [ Loeb Carolyn Planning reunification: the planning history of the fall of the Berlin Wall Planning Perspectives 2006 January 21 67–87 http://server.filozofia.bme.hu/~kerekgyarto/Berlin%20atvaltozasai/Szovegek/fal%2C%20emlekezes/berlin_wall.pdf 14 May 2012 ] and this had consequences for the reunification of the city. West Berlin had received considerably more financial assistance for reconstruction and refurbishment. [ Loeb Carolyn Planning reunification: the planning history of the fall of the Berlin Wall Planning Perspectives 2006 January 21 67–87 http://server.filozofia.bme.hu/~kerekgyarto/Berlin%20atvaltozasai/Szovegek/fal%2C%20emlekezes/berlin_wall.pdf 14 May 2012 ] There was considerable disparity in the general condition of many of the buildings; at the time of reunification, East Berlin still contained many leveled areas, which were previous sites of destroyed buildings from World War II, as well as damaged buildings that had not been repaired. [ Loeb Carolyn Planning reunification: the planning history of the fall of the Berlin Wall Planning Perspectives 2006 January 21 67–87 http://server.filozofia.bme.hu/~kerekgyarto/Berlin%20atvaltozasai/Szovegek/fal%2C%20emlekezes/berlin_wall.pdf 14 May 2012 ] An immediate challenge facing the reunified city was the need for physical connectivity between the East and the West, specifically the organisation of infrastructure. [ Loeb Carolyn Planning reunification: the planning history of the fall of the Berlin Wall Planning Perspectives 2006 January 21 67–87 http://server.filozofia.bme.hu/~kerekgyarto/Berlin%20atvaltozasai/Szovegek/fal%2C%20emlekezes/berlin_wall.pdf 14 May 2012 ] In the period following World War II, approximately half of the railway lines were removed in East Berlin.

[ Schwedler Hanns-Uve Urban Planning and Cultural Inclusion Lessons from Belfast and Berlin 2001 Palgrave Macmillan 978-0-333-79368-8 ] Prior to the reunification of the city, the Land Use Plan of 1988 and General Development Plan of 1980 defined the spatial planning criteria for West and East Berlin, respectively. [ Schwedler Hanns-Uve Urban Planning and Cultural Inclusion Lessons from Belfast and Berlin 2001 Palgrave Macmillan 978-0-333-79368-8 ] Although these existing frameworks were in place before reunification, after the fall of the wall there was a need to develop new instruments in order to facilitate the spatial and economic development of the re-unified city. The first Land Use Plan following reunification was ultimately enacted in 1994. [ Schwedler Hanns-Uve Urban Planning and Cultural Inclusion Lessons from Belfast and Berlin 2001 Palgrave Macmillan 978-0-333-79368-8 ] The urban development policy of reunified Berlin, termed &quot; Critical Reconstruction &quot;, aimed to facilitate urban diversity by supporting a mixture of land functions. [ Tölle A Urban identity policies in Berlin: From critical reconstruction to reconstructing the Wall. Institute of Socio-Economic Geography and Spatial Management 2010 27 348-357 ] This policy directed the urban planning strategy for the reunified city. A &quot; Critical Reconstruction &quot; policy agenda was to redefine Berlin&apos;s urban identity through its pre-war and pre-Nazi legacy. Elements of &quot; Critical Reconstruction &quot; were also reflected in the overall strategic planning document for downtown Berlin, entitled &quot; Inner City Planning Framework &quot;. [ Tölle A Urban identity policies in Berlin: From critical reconstruction to reconstructing the Wall. Institute of Socio-Economic Geography and Spatial Management 2010 27 348-357 ] Reunification policy emphasised restoration of the traditional Berlin landscape. To this effect, the policy excluded the &quot; legacy of socialist East Berlin and notably of divided Berlin from the new urban identity &quot;. [ Tölle A Urban identity policies in Berlin: From critical reconstruction to reconstructing the Wall. Institute of Socio-Economic Geography and Spatial Management 2010 27 348-357 ] Ultimately, following the collapse of the German Democratic Republic on 3 October 1990, all planning projects under the socialist regime were abandoned [ Urban F Designing the past in East Berlin before and after the German Reunification. Progress in Planning 2007 68 1-55 ]. Vacant lots, open areas and empty fields in East Berlin were subject to redevelopment, in addition to space previously occupied by the Wall and associated buffering zone. [ Loeb Carolyn Planning reunification: the planning history of the fall of the Berlin Wall Planning Perspectives 2006 January 21 67–87 http://server.filozofia.bme.hu/~kerekgyarto/Berlin%20atvaltozasai/Szovegek/fal%2C%20emlekezes/berlin_wall.pdf 14 May 2012 ] Many of these sites were positioned in central, strategic locations of the reunified city. The removal of the Wall saw the city&apos;s spatial structure reoriented.

Green space and recreational areas were allocated 38% of freed land; 6% of freed land was dedicated to mass-transit systems to address transport inadequacies.

Another key priority was reestablishing Berlin as the capital of Germany, and this required buildings to serve government needs, including the &quot; redevelopment of sites for scores of foreign embassies &quot;.

[ Loeb Carolyn Planning reunification: the planning history of the fall of the Berlin Wall Planning Perspectives 2006 January 21 67–87 http://server.filozofia.bme.hu/~kerekgyarto/Berlin%20atvaltozasai/Szovegek/fal%2C%20emlekezes/berlin_wall.pdf 14 May 2012 ] In the centre of East Berlin much of the modernist heritage of the East German state was gradually removed [ Urban F Designing the past in East Berlin before and after the German Reunification Progress in Planning 2007 68 1-55 ]. Reunification saw the removal of politically motivated street names and monuments in the East (Large 2001) in an attempt to reduce the socialist legacy from the face of East Berlin. [ Tölle A Urban identity policies in Berlin: From critical reconstruction to reconstructing the Wall. Institute of Socio-Economic Geography and Spatial Management 2010 27 348-357 ] Immediately following the fall of the Wall, Berlin experienced a boom in the construction industry. [ Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Urban renaissance [electronic resource]: Berlin: Towards an integrated strategy for social cohesion and economic development / organisation for economic co-operation and development. 2003 OECD Publishing Paris ] Redevelopment initiatives saw Berlin turn into one of the largest construction sites in the world through the 1990s and early 2000s. [ Schwedler Hanns-Uve Urban Planning and Cultural Inclusion Lessons from Belfast and Berlin 2001 Palgrave Macmillan 978-0-333-79368-8 ] The fall of the Berlin Wall also had economic consequences. Two German systems covering distinctly divergent degrees of economic opportunity suddenly came into intimate contact. [ Frank D. H.

Transformation of Cities in Central and Eastern Europe.

M. After the Wall: 20 years on. Policy 2010 25 4 8 ]. Facilitation of economic development through planning measures failed to close the disparity between East and West, not only in terms of the economic opportunity but also housing conditions and transport options. [ Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Urban renaissance [electronic resource]: Berlin: Towards an integrated strategy for social cohesion and economic development / organisation for economic co-operation and development. 2003 OECD Publishing Paris ] Tölle states that &quot; the initial euphoria about having become one unified people again was increasingly replaced by a growing sense of difference between Easterners ( &quot; Ossis &quot; ) and Westerners ( &quot; Wessis &quot; ) &quot; [ Tölle A Urban identity policies in Berlin: From critical reconstruction to reconstructing the Wall. Institute of Socio-Economic Geography and Spatial Management 2010 27 352 ] The fall of the Wall also instigated immediate cultural change [ Grésillon B Berlin, cultural metropolis: Changes in the cultural geography of Berlin since reunification ECUMENE 1999 April 284 ]. The first consequence was the closure in East Berlin of politically oriented cultural institutions. [ Grésillon B Berlin, cultural metropolis: Changes in the cultural geography of Berlin since reunification ECUMENE 1999 April 284 ] The fall of the Berlin Wall and the factors descibed above led to mass migration from East Berlin and East Germany, producing a large labour supply shock in the West. [ Frank D. H. The Effect of Migration on Natives&apos; Employment Outcomes: Evidence from the Fall of the Berlin Wall. INSEAD Working Papers Selection 13 2007. May ] Emigration from the East, totaling 870,000 people between 1989 and 1992 alone [ Smith E. O. The German Economy 1994 Routledge London 266 ], led to worse employment outcomes for the least-educated workers, for blue-collar workers, for men and for foreign nationals [ Frank D. H. The Effect of Migration on Natives&apos; Employment Outcomes: Evidence from the Fall of the Berlin Wall. INSEAD Working Papers Selection 13 2007.

Institute of Socio-Economic Geography and Spatial Management 2010 27 348-357 ] Yet ultimately, the disparity between East and West portions of Berlin has led to the city achieving a new urban identity. A number of locales of East Berlin, characterised by dwellings of in-between use of abandoned space for little to no rent, have become the focal point and foundation of Berlin&apos;s burgeoning creative activities.

Creativity is Berlin&apos;s future. &quot; [ Jakob D. Constructing the creative neighbourhood: hopes and limitations of creative city policies in Berlin. City, Culture and Society 2010 December 1 4 193-198 ] Overall, the Berlin government&apos;s engagement in creativity is strongly centered on marketing and promotional initiatives instead of creative production.
