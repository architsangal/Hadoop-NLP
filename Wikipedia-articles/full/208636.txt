Reed &amp; Raschke also question the information put out by Uyghur expatriates that deny ETIM&apos;s existence or impact, as the Uyghurs who leave Xinjiang are those who object most to government policy, are unable to provide first-hand analysis, and have an incentive to exaggerate repression and downplay militancy.
