The Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to our galaxy ( Milky Way ), but not the closest galaxy overall. It gets its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the Andromeda constellation, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. The Andromeda Galaxy is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also contains our galaxy (Milky Way), the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 30 other smaller galaxies.

The first description of the object based on telescopic observation was given by German astronomer Simon Marius on December 15, 1612. [ Davidson Norman 1985 Astronomy and the imagination: a new approach to man&apos;s experience of the stars 203 Routledge Kegan &amp; Paul 0-7102-0371-3 ] Charles Messier catalogued it as object M31 in 1764 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer, unaware of Al Sufi&apos;s earlier work. In 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of the M31. He believed it to be the nearest of all the &quot; great nebulae &quot; and based on the colour and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius. [ Herschel W. 1785 On the Construction of the Heavens Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 75 0 213–266 10.1098/rstl.1785.0012 ] William Huggins in 1864 observed the spectrum of M31 and noted that it differed from a gaseous nebula.

The Andromeda nebula was very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this it was deduced that M31 had a stellar nature. In 1885, a supernova (known as &quot; S Andromedae &quot; ) was seen in M31, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time M31 was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a nova, and was named accordingly &quot; Nova 1885 &quot;. [ Backhouse T. W. 1888 nebula in Andromeda and Nova, 1885 Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 48 108 1888MNRAS..48..108B ] The first photographs of M31 were taken in 1887 by Isaac Roberts from his private observatory in Sussex, England. The long-duration exposure allowed the spiral structure of the galaxy to be seen for the first time. [ Roberts I. 1899 A Selection of Photographs of Stars, Star-clusters and Nebulae II Universal Press London ] However, at the time this object was still commonly believed to be a nebula within our galaxy, and Roberts mistakenly believed that M31 and similar spiral nebulae were actually solar systems being formed, with the satellites nascent planets [ April 2012 ]. The radial velocity of this object with respect to our solar system was measured in 1912 by Vesto Slipher at the Lowell Observatory, using spectroscopy. The result was the largest velocity recorded at that time, at [ 300 km/s ], moving in the direction of the Sun. [ Slipher V. M. 1913 The Radial Velocity of the Andromeda Nebula Lowell Observatory Bulletin 1 56–57 1913LowOB...1b..56S ] [ Island universe ] Location of M31 in the Andromeda constellation In 1917, American astronomer Heber Curtis observed a nova within M31. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky. As a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of [ 500000 ly ]. He became a proponent of the so-called &quot; island universes &quot; hypothesis, which held that spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies. [ Curtis H. D. 1988 Novae in Spiral Nebulae and the Island Universe Theory Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific 100 6 1988PASP..100....6C 10.1086/132128 ] In 1920, the Great Debate between Harlow Shapley and Curtis took place, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula (M31) was an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in our own Galaxy, as well as the significant Doppler shift. In 1922 Ernst Öpik presented a very elegant and simple astrophysical method to estimate the distance of M31. His result put the Andromeda Nebula far outside our Galaxy at a distance of about 450,000 parsec, which is about 1,500,000 ly. [ Öpik E. 1922 An estimate of the distance of the Andromeda Nebula Astrophysical Journal 55 406–410 1922ApJ....55..406O 10.1086/142680 ] Edwin Hubble settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic Cepheid variable star s for the first time on astronomical photos of M31. These were made using the 2.5  metre (100  in) Hooker telescope, and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our Galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from our own.

In 1943 Walter Baade was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Based on his observations of this galaxy, he was able to discern two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.)

In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. This candidate was detected using a technique called microlensing, which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.

In 2003, using the infrared surface brightness fluctuation s (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value of Freedman et al. 2001 and using a metallicity correction of −0.2 mag dex −1 in (O/H), an estimate of [ 2.57 +/- 0.06 Mly on ] was derived. { ultraviolet light by } { GALEX } Using the Cepheid variable method, an estimate of 2.51 ± 0.13 Mly (770 ± 40 kpc) was achieved in 2004. [ Karachentsev I. D. et al. 2004 A Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies Astronomical Journal 127 4 2031–2068 2004AJ....127.2031K 10.1086/382905 ] In 2005, a group of astronomers consisting of Ignasi Ribas ( CSIC, Institute for Space Studies of Catalonia (IEEC)) and his colleagues announced the discovery of an eclipsing binary star in the Andromeda Galaxy. The binary star, designated M31VJ00443799+4129236, [ C c none ] has two luminous and hot blue stars of types O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars, which occur every 3.54969  days, the astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars they were able to measure the absolute magnitude of the stars. When the visual and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be measured. The stars lie at the distance of [ 2.52 +/- 0.14 Mly ] and the whole Andromeda Galaxy at about [ 2.5 Mly on ]. This new value is in excellent agreement with the previous, independent Cepheid-based distance value. M31 is close enough that the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method may also be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to M31 using this technique in 2005 yielded [ 2.56 +/- 0.08 Mly on ]. [ McConnachie A. W. et al. 2005 Distances and metallicities for 17 Local Group galaxies Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 356 4 979–997 2005MNRAS.356..979M 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.08514.x astro-ph/0410489 ] Averaged together, all these distance measurements give a combined distance estimate of [ 2.54 +/- 0.06 Mly on ]. [ A a none ] Based upon the above distance, the diameter of M31 at the widest point is estimated to be [ 141 +/- 3 kly on ].

Thus M31 may be less massive than our own galaxy, although the error range is still too large to say for certain. Even so, the masses of the Milky Way and M31 are comparable, and M31&apos;s spheroid actually has a higher stellar density than that of the Milky Way. [ Kalirai J. S. et al. 2006 The Metal-Poor Halo of the Andromeda Spiral Galaxy (M31) Astrophysical Journal 648 1 389–404 10.1086/505697 2006astro.ph..5170K astro-ph/0605170 ] In particular, M31 appears to have significantly more common stars than the Milky Way, and the estimated luminosity of M31, ~2.6 [ 10 ]   &apos;&apos;L&apos;&apos; ☉, is about 25% higher than that of our own galaxy. [ van den Bergh S. 1999 The local group of galaxies Astronomy and Astrophysics Review 9 3–4 273–318 10.1007/s001590050019 1999A &amp; ARv...9..273V ] However the rate of star formation in the Milky Way is much higher, with M31 only producing about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernova e in the Milky Way is also double that of M31. [ Liller W. Mayer B. 1987 The Rate of Nova Production in the Galaxy Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific 99 606–609 1987PASP...99..606L 10.1086/132021 ] This suggests that M31 once experienced a great star formation phase, but is now in a relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of M31.

[ Results for Messier 31 http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/ NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database NASA / IPAC 2006-11-01 ] However, data from the 2MASS survey showed that the bulge of M31 has a box-like appearance, which implies that the galaxy is actually a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, with the Andromeda Galaxy&apos;s bar viewed almost directly along its long axis. [ Beaton R. L. et al. 2006 Unveiling the Boxy Bulge and Bar of the Andromeda Spiral Galaxy Astrophysical Journal Letters 658 2 L91 2006astro.ph..5239B 10.1086/514333 astro-ph/0605239 ] In 2005, astronomers used the Keck telescopes to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself.

This constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than [ 220000 ly pc ] in diameter. Previously, estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy&apos;s size ranged from [ 70000 to 120000 ly pc ] across. The galaxy is inclined an estimated 77° relative to the Earth (where an angle of 90° would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. [ UC Santa Cruz January 9, 2001 Astronomers Find Evidence of an Extreme Warp in the Stellar Disk of the Andromeda Galaxy http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/archive/00-01/01-01/andromeda.html 2006-05-24 ] A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near M31. The galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in M31&apos;s arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required. Spectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the rotational velocity of M31 at various radii from the core. In the vicinity of the core, the rotational velocity climbs to a peak of [ 225 km/s ] at a radius of [ 1300 ly on ], then descends to a minimum at [ 7000 ly on ] where the rotation velocity may be as low as [ 50 km/s ]. Thereafter the velocity steadily climbs again out to a radius of [ 33000 ly on ], where it reaches a peak of [ 250 km/s ]. The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around [ 200 km/s ] at [ 80000 ly on ]. These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about 6 [ 9 ]   M ☉ in the nucleus. The total mass of the galaxy increases linear ly out to [ 45000 ly on ], then more slowly beyond that radius. [ Rubin V. C. Ford W. K. J. 1970 Rotation of the Andromeda Nebula from a Spectroscopic Survey of Emission Astrophysical Journal 159 379 1970ApJ...159..379R 10.1086/150317 ] The spiral arm s of M31 are outlined by a series of H II region s that Baade described as resembling &quot; beads on a string &quot;. They appear to be tightly wound, although they are more widely spaced than in our galaxy. [ Arp H. 1964 Andromeda Nebula from a Spectroscopic Survey of Emission Astrophysical Journal 139 1045 1964ApJ...139.1045A 10.1086/147844 ] Rectified images of the galaxy show a fairly normal spiral galaxy with the arms wound up in a clockwise direction. There are two continuous trailing arms that are separated from each other by a minimum of about [ 13000 ly on ]. These can be followed outward from a distance of roughly [ 1600 ly on ] from the core. The most likely cause of the spiral pattern is thought to be interaction with galaxy M32. This can be seen by the displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars. [ Braun R. 1991 The distribution and kinematics of neutral gas, HI region in M31 Astrophysical Journal 372 54–66 1991ApJ...372...54B 10.1086/169954 ] In 1998, images from the European Space Agency &apos;s Infrared Space Observatory demonstrated that the overall form of the Andromeda Galaxy may be transitioning into a ring galaxy. The gas and dust within M31 is generally formed into several overlapping rings, with a particularly prominent ring formed at a radius of [ 32000 ly on ] from the core. [ October 14, 1998 ISO unveils the hidden rings of Andromeda http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid%3D12748 European Space Agency 2006-05-24 ] This ring is hidden from visible light images of the galaxy because it is composed primarily of cold dust. Close examination of the inner region of M31 showed a smaller dust ring that is believed to have been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200  million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the galaxy in Andromeda along the latter&apos;s polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in M31. [ October 18, 2006 Busted! Astronomers Nab Culprit in Galactic Hit-and-Run http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/pr0628.html Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 2006-10-18 ] Studies of the extended halo of M31 show that it is roughly comparable to that of the Milky Way, with stars in the halo being generally &quot; metal-poor &quot;, and increasingly so with greater distance. [ Kalirai J. S. et al. 2006 The Metal-Poor Halo of the Andromeda Spiral Galaxy (M31) Astrophysical Journal 648 1 389 2006astro.ph..5170K 10.1086/505697 astro-ph/0605170 ] This evidence indicates that the two galaxies have followed similar evolutionary paths. They are likely to have accreted and assimilated about 1–200 low-mass galaxies during the past 12  billion years. [ Bullock J. S. Johnston K.V. 2005 Tracing Galaxy Formation with Stellar Halos I: Methods Astrophysical Journal 635 2 931–949 2005ApJ...635..931B 10.1086/497422 astro-ph/0506467 ] The stars in the extended halos of M31 and the Milky Way may extend nearly one-third the distance separating the two galaxies. [ Nucleus ] { NASA / } { ESA  photo&apos;&apos; } M31 is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very center. In a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge. The luminosity of the nucleus is in excess of the most luminous globular clusters. [ July 2009 ] { Chandra X-ray telescope image of the center of M31. A number of X-ray sources, likely X-ray binary stars, within Andromeda&apos;s central region appear as yellowish dots. The blue source at the center is at the position of the supermassive black hole. } In 1991 Tod R. Lauer used WFPC, then on board the Hubble Space Telescope, to image M31&apos;s inner nucleus. The nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by [ 1.5 pc on ]. The brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy. The dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a black hole measured at 3-5 × 10 7 M ☉ in 1993, [ Lauer T. R. et al. 1993 Planetary camera observations of the double nucleus of M31 Astronomical Journal 106 4 1436 –1447, 1710 –1712 10.1086/116737 1993AJ....106.1436L ] and at 1.1–2.3 × 10 8 M ☉ in 2005.

[ Tremaine S. 1995 An Eccentric-Disk Model for the Nucleus of M31 Astronomical Journal 110 628–633 1995AJ....110..628T 10.1086/117548 astro-ph/9502065 ] The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1. [ July 20, 1993 Hubble Space Telescope Finds a Double Nucleus in the Andromeda Galaxy http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1993/18/text/ Hubble News Desk 2006-05-26 ] While at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus was the remnant of a small galaxy &quot; cannibalized &quot; by M31, [ Schewe P. F. Stein Ben The Andromeda Galaxy has a Double Nucleus Physics News Update American Institute of Physics http://www.aip.org/pnu/1993/split/pnu138-2.htm 2009-07-10 ] this is no longer considered a viable explanation, largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to tidal disruption by the central black hole. While this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center. [ Discrete sources ] { NASA / } { ESA  photo&apos;&apos; } Apparently, by late 1968, no X-rays had been detected from the Andromeda Galaxy. [ Fujimoto M. Hayakawa S. Kato T. 1969 Correlation between the Densities of X-Ray Sources and Interstellar Gas Astrophysics and Space Science 4 1 64–83 1969Ap &amp; SS...4...64F 10.1007/BF00651263 ] A balloon flight on October 20, 1970, set an upper limit for detectable hard X-rays from M31. [ Peterson L. E. 1973 Hard Cosmic X-Ray Sources Bradt, H.; Giacconi, R. X- and Gamma-Ray Astronomy, Proceedings of IAU Symposium no. 55 held in Madrid, Spain, 11–13 May 1972 51–73 International Astronomical Union 1973IAUS...55...51P ] Multiple X-ray sources have since been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the ESA&apos;s XMM-Newton orbiting observatory. Robin Barnard et al. hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or neutron stars, which are heating incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. The spectrum of the neutron stars is the same as the hypothesized black holes, but can be distinguished by their masses. [ Barnard R. Kolb U. Osborne J.P. 2005 Timing the bright X-ray population of the core of M31 with XMM-Newton astro-ph astro-ph/0508284 ] There are approximately 460 globular cluster s associated with the Andromeda Galaxy.

[ Hubble news desk STSci-1996-11 April 24, 1996 Hubble Spies Globular Cluster in Neighboring Galaxy http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1996/11/ 2006-05-26 ] It contains several million stars, and is about twice as luminous as Omega Centauri, the brightest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. Globular One (or G1) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular. As a result, some consider G1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by M31 in the distant past. [ Meylan G. et al. 2001 G1 in M31 - Giant Globular Cluster or Core of a Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy? Astronomical Journal 122 2 830–841 10.1086/321166 2001AJ....122..830M astro-ph/0105013 ] The globular with the greatest apparent brightness is G76 which is located in the south-west arm&apos;s eastern half. In 2005, astronomers discovered a completely new type of star cluster in M31. The new-found clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger–several hundred light-years across–and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. [ Huxor A. P. et al. 2005 A new population of extended, luminous, star clusters in the halo of M31 Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 360 3 993–1006 astro-ph/0412223 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09086.x 2005MNRAS.360.1007H ] [ Satellites ] [ Andromeda&apos;s satellite galaxies ] Like the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy has satellite galaxies, consisting of 14 known dwarf galaxies. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110. Based on current evidence, it appears that M32 underwent a close encounter with M31 (Andromeda) in the past. M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past. [ Bekki K. et al. 2001 A New Formation Model for M32: A Threshed Early-type Spiral? Astrophysical Journal Letters 557 1 L39–L42 2001ApJ...557L..39B 10.1086/323075 astro-ph/0107117 ] M110 also appears to be interacting with M31, and astronomers have found a stream of metal-rich stars in the halo of M31 that appears to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies. [ Ibata R. et al. 2001 A giant stream of metal-rich stars in the halo of the galaxy M31 Nature 412 6842 49–52 10.1038/35083506 11452300 ] M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation. [ Young L. M. 2000 Properties of the Molecular Clouds in NGC 205 Astronomical Journal 120 5 2460 –2470 10.1086/316806 2000AJ....120.2460Y astro-ph/0007169 ] In 2006 it was discovered that nine of these galaxies lay along a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy, rather than being randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions. This may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites. [ Koch A. Grebel E.

The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are thus expected to collide in about 4.5  billion years, although the details are uncertain since Andromeda&apos;s tangential velocity with respect to the Milky Way is only known to within about a factor of two. [ The Grand Collision The Sky At Night November 5, 2007 ] A likely outcome of the collision is that the galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy. [ Cox T. J.

The fate of the Earth and the Solar System in the event of a collision are currently unknown. If the galaxies do not merge, there is a small chance that the Solar System could be ejected from the Milky Way or join M31.
