[ Shoestring other uses Shoestring (disambiguation) ] For the football player nicknamed Shoelace see Denard Robinson. [ July 2011 ] Black shoelace Shoelaces, which are also called shoe-strings, shoe laces, or boot laces, are a system commonly used to secure shoes, boot s and other footwear. They typically consist of a pair of strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks on either side of the shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe. [ Shoelace construction ] Traditional shoelaces were made of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other materials used in the manufacture of rope. Modern shoelaces often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic shoelaces generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant nomex are applied in safety boot s for firefighter s. There are also various elasticized shoelaces: Traditional &quot; elastic &quot; laces look identical to normal laces, and can simply be tied and untied as normal. They may also come with a permanent clip so they can be fastened invisibly. &quot; Knotty &quot; laces have a series of &quot; fat &quot; sections, which restrict movement through eyelets. These can be used to adjust tension throughout the lacing area. These laces can be tied or the ends can be left loose. &quot; Twirly &quot; laces are like a tight elastic helix, which can simply be pulled tight without requiring a knot. Elastic laces both make the lacing more comfortable as well as allowing the shoe to be slipped on and off without tying or untying, which makes them a popular choice for children, the elderly and athletes. { aglet s : copper, plastic, and brass } The stiff section at each end of the shoelace, which both keeps the twine from unraveling and also makes it easier to hold the lace and feed it through the eyelets, is called an aglet, also spelled aiglet. Shoelaces with a flat cross-section are generally easier to hold and stay tied more securely than those with a round cross-section. Very wide flat laces are often called &quot; fat laces. &quot; Leather shoelaces with a square cross-section, which are very common on boat shoes, are notoriously prone to coming undone. Shoelaces can be coated, either in the factory or with aftermarket products, to increase friction and help them stay tied. [ Shoelace tying ] [ Shoelace knot ] Basic shoe-tying knot [ Common bow ] Shoelaces are typically tied off at the top of the shoe using a simple bow knot. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of shoelace exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half knots tied one on top of the other, with the second half-knot looped in order to allow for quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends. When tying the half-knots, a right-over-left half knot followed by a left-over-right half knot (or vice versa) forms a square or reef knot, a fairly effective knot for the purpose of tying shoelaces. However, tying two consecutive right-over-left half knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half knots) forms the infamous granny knot, which is much less secure. [ Ashley Clifford W. The Ashley Book of Knots 1944 Doubleday 0-385-04025-3 75 ] Most people who use it will find themselves regularly retying their shoelaces. [ http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/slipping.htm Slipping Shoelace Knots? Ian&apos;s Shoelace Site 2010-11-16 ] If the loops lie across the shoe (left to right), the knot is probably a square knot. If they lie along the shoe (heel to toe), the knot is probably a granny knot. [ Other more secure knots ] There are several more secure alternatives to the common shoelace bow, with names such as Turquoise Turtle Shoelace Knot, or Shoemaker&apos;s Knot, Better Bow Shoelace Knot, Surgeon&apos;s Shoelace Knot, and Ian&apos;s Secure Shoelace Knot, or double slip knot. One such knot has been patented in 1999 under the title &quot; Shoelace tying system &quot;. [ http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5997051.html Shoelace tying system Free Patents Online 2010-06-11 ] These are all variations of the same concept of looping the top part of the knot twice instead of once, which results in a finished bow of almost identical appearance but with the laces wrapped twice around the middle. This double-wrap holds the shoelaces more securely tied while still allowing them to be untied with a (slightly firmer) pull on the loose end(s). [ Length ] The proper length of a shoelace fitting it to a shoe varies according to the type of lacing used as well as the type of lace. However at a rough reference the following guide can be used. { Royal Laces } Note this is the total number of holes, if you count 6 holes on one side you have 12 holes ( 150cm) No of holes Length/cm 2 45 3 65 4 75-85 5 85-90 6 100 7 8 120 9 10 130 11 12 150 13 14 180 15 16 200 [ Shoe lacing ] An Oxford shoe with straight lacing This is the process of running the shoelaces through the holes, eyelets, loops, or hooks to hold together the sides of the shoe with many common lacing methods. [ Ian W. Fieggen 37 Different Ways To Lace Shoes http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/lacingmethods.htm Ian&apos;s Shoelace Site 2012-03-27 ] There are, in fact, almost two trillion ways to lace a shoe with six pairs of eyelets. [ Ian W. Fieggen 2 Trillion Lacing Methods? http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/2trillionmethods.htm Ian&apos;s Shoelace Site 2006-09-25 ] Black sneakers with white shoelaces using a criss-cross lacing pattern The most common lacing method, termed criss-cross lacing, is also one of the strongest and most efficient, [ Burkard Polster Mathematics: What is the best way to lace your shoes? http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6915/abs/420476a.html Nature 2006-07-26 ] but is not so well suited to certain dress shoes, such as Oxfords, because the central shoelace crossovers prevent the sides of the shoe from coming together in the middle. For such shoes, methods such as straight lacing are better suited. Many shoe lacing methods have been developed with specific functional benefits, such as being faster or easier to tighten or loosen, binding more tightly, being more comfortable, using up more lace or less lace, adjusting fit, preventing slippage, and suiting specific types of shoes. One such method, patented in 2003 as &quot; Double helix shoe lacing process &quot;, runs in a double helix pattern and results in less friction and faster and easier tightening and loosening.

[ http://www.hildus.com/method.html Rinlers Instant Lace Up ] { Etnies shoes with checkerboard laces } Many other lacing methods have been developed purely for appearance, often at the expense of functionality. One of the most popular decorative methods, checkerboard lacing, is very difficult to tighten or loosen without destroying the pattern. Shoes with checkerboard lacing are generally treated as &quot; slip-ons &quot;. [ History ] It is as difficult to determine the exact history of shoelaces as it is for shoes. Archaeological records of footwear are rare because shoes were generally made of materials that deteriorated readily. The Areni-1 shoe, which has been dated to around 3500 BC, is a simple leather &quot; shoe &quot; with leather &quot; shoelaces &quot; passing through slotted &quot; eyelets &quot; cut into the hide. The more complex shoes worn by Ã–tzi the Iceman, who lived around 3300 BC, were bound with &quot; shoelaces &quot; made of lime bark string. As for shoelaces in the sense that we know them in modern times, the Museum of London has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side of the shoe. [ Grew F. de Neegaard, M. Shoes and Pattens - Medieval Finds from Excavations in London 2006 The Boydell Press 1-84383-238-0 ] [ Myths ] A popular myth [ January 2012 ] states that Gurkha soldiers, fighting for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces of the soldiers they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a criss-cross pattern. Criss-cross laces could therefore mean the difference between life and death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops. Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.

There are hooks to help lace shoelaces tightly. They are especially useful for skates where tight lacing is important. Shoelace covers protect the laces, especially in wrestling. Shoelace charms are decorative, as are colored shoelaces. Some laces are colored using expensive dyes, other, more &quot; personal &quot; colors, are drawn-on with permanent marker s. Some dress code s (especially high schools) will specifically exclude color laces and charms. Lace-locks hold laces together, eliminating the need for tying. There are shoelace tags, sometimes called deubrÃ©, with two holes or slots through which the shoelace is passed. These are worn on the section of shoelace closest to the toes, in other words the last lace, so that the image or writing on the tag is visible (as can be seen at right).
