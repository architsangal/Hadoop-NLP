[ the book series the television series based on the books The Magic School Bus (TV series) ] The Magic School Bus is a series of children&apos;s books about science written by author Joanna Cole. They feature the antics of Ms. Valerie Frizzle, and her class, who board a magical school bus which takes them on field trips to impossible locations such as the solar system, clouds, the past, and the human body. The books are written in the first person from the point of view of an unnamed student in &quot; the Friz&apos;s &quot; class. The class pet, Liz, a lizard, accompanied the class on their field trips. Since the Magic School Bus books present scientific facts in the form of stories in which fantastic things happen (for example, a bus turns into a spaceship, or children shrink to the size of blood cells), each book has a page at the end detailing in a humorous manner which parts of the book represented scientific fact and which were fanciful storytelling. In the books&apos; television adaptation, the series breaks the fourth wall at the end of each episode, in which the &quot; producers &quot;, guest stars, or characters of the show receives phone calls from kids complaining about how some things that happened on the show couldn&apos;t happen in real life. The producer that is seen most of the time is voiced by Malcolm-Jamal Warner. [ History ] Craig Walker, vice-president and senior editorial director at Scholastic Co., stated that the concept began with the idea of combining science with fictional stories, and Joanna Cole (who had written both science and humor before) and Bruce Degen were then approached with creating such a series; Walker also states that his own memories of school field trips and of a teacher he had once had served as further inspiration.
