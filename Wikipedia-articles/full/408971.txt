He is a member of the Democratic Party. He is considered to be one of the most influential liberal members of Congress. His district includes much of the western part of the city of Los Angeles, as well as West Hollywood, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills, and used to be the 29th District before the post-2000 census redistricting. Before his election to Congress, he served six years in the California State Assembly. [ Early life, education, and early career ] Waxman was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Esther (Silverman) and Ralph Louis Waxman. His father was born in Montreal, Canada, and his mother was from Pennsylvania; all of his grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Chişinău. { http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/waxman.htm } He attended college at UCLA, earning a bachelor&apos;s degree in political science in 1961 and a degree from UCLA&apos;s law school in 1964. After graduating, he worked as a lawyer. He was elected to the California Assembly in 1969 and served three terms. Along with Congressman Howard Berman, Waxman co-founded the Los Angeles County Young Democrats. [ U.S. House of Representatives ] [ Elections ] In 1974, the special masters plan a Hispanic influence district. Ed Roybal&apos;s as some areas from Thomas Rees&apos; district was formed to create the 24th district, in the neighborhoods west of downtown Los Angeles. Waxman won the Democratic nomination for the district, and easily won the general election, as this was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district. He never won re-election with less than 61% of the vote. He has been re-elected 16 times, never facing substantive opposition. He faced no major-party opposition in 1986, and was completely unopposed in 2008. His district has changed numbers three times in his tenure—from the 24th (1975–1993) to the 29th (1993–2003) to the 30th (2003–present). He is one of two surviving members of the large Democratic freshman class of 1975, along with George Miller of California. Waxman&apos;s district, California&apos;s 30th congressional district, includes Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Malibu, West Hollywood, and Westlake Village as well as such areas of Los Angeles as West Los Angeles, Fairfax, Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Beverlywood, Topanga, Chatsworth, Palms, Westwood, West Hills, Westside Village, Woodland Hills. [ Tenure ] Before the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 1995, Waxman was a powerful figure in the House as chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment from 1979. In this role he conducted investigations into a range of health and environmental issues, including universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, AIDS and air and water pollution. According to his Web site, Waxman&apos;s legislative priorities are health and environmental issues. These include universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, tobacco, AIDS, air and water quality standards, pesticides, nursing home quality standards, women&apos;s health research and reproductive rights, the availability and cost of prescription drugs, and the right of communities to know about pollution levels. As an example of Waxman&apos;s thoughts regarding tobacco, on April 13, 2010, he requested that Major League Baseball ban smokeless tobacco. [ April 26, 2010 For the Record: Requested Sports Illustrated 112 18 16 Time Terry McDonell Terry McDonell ] Waxman was strongly critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act. In 1998, he created a &quot; Special Investigations Division &quot; to investigate matters that he felt the full committee had neglected. This was possible because the committee has broad powers to investigate any matter with federal policy implications, even if another committee has jurisdiction over it. { Special Investigations. democrats.reform.house.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-22. } He has also harshly criticized the Republicans for ignoring their &quot; constitutional responsibility &quot; to conduct oversight over the government. { Committee on Government Reform Minority Office. democrats.reform.house.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-22. } With the Democrats&apos; victory in the 2006 midterm elections, Waxman became chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the principal investigative committee of the House. He was the committee&apos;s ranking Democrat from 1997 to 2007. In 2009, he began serving as the Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee after defeating Chairman John Dingell in a 137–122 secret vote of House Democrats on November 20, 2008. On the day after the 2006 elections, Waxman directed his aides to draw up an &quot; oversight plan &quot; for the panel. He had already let it be known that he wanted to investigate Halliburton, as well as its alleged malfeasance related to government contracts in Iraq. It is very likely that he could also investigate the numerous scandals surrounding Jack Abramoff. This led to concerns among Democratic aides that the Government Reform Committee under Waxman would stage a repeat of the committee&apos;s performance under the Clinton administration, when it issued over 1,000 subpoenas. However, Waxman told Newsweek that he is interested in accountability and not retaliation. { Democrats’ Challenge: Stay in the Center – Newsweek National News – MSNBC.com } [ November 2011 ] On March 16, 2004, at Waxman&apos;s request, the Committee on Government Reform Minority Office published &quot; Iraq on the Record, the Bush Administration&apos;s Public Statements on Iraq &quot; { Henry A. Waxman Iraq on the Record. oversight.house.gov } a detailed and searchable collection of 237 specific misleading statements made by Bush Administration officials about the threat posed by Iraq. It contains statements that were misleading based on what was known to the Administration at the time the statements were made. It does not include statements that appear mistaken only in hindsight. If a statement was an accurate reflection of U.S. intelligence at the time it was made, it was excluded even if it now appears erroneous. In 2006, Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Waxman with its Good Government Award for his various contributions to government transparency and oversight. { Good Government Award Home Page. Project On Government Oversight Website. Retrieved July 1, 2010. } In 2007, Waxman changed the committee&apos;s name from the Government Reform Committee to the &quot; Oversight and Government Reform Committee, &quot; or the &quot; Oversight Committee &quot; for short. In 1985, Waxman sponsored a bill supported by affluent homeowners groups in his district to ban federal funding for the Red Line subway after a methane gas explosion in the Fairfax District. In 2005, a robust real estate market, multi-dwelling construction boom, and lack of public mass transit planning on the westside caused by Waxman&apos;s bill resulted in gridlock throughout Waxman&apos;s district. { Christine Pelisek Red Line to Somewhere, LA Weekly, 3 March 2005 } At the request of Los Angeles Mayor and LACMTA Board President Antonio Villaraigosa, Waxman agreed to lift the ban if a panel of five engineers found tunneling under the Miracle Mile stretch of Wilshire Boulevard to be safe. In October 2005, the panel decided that tunneling was possible, and on December 16, Waxman responded by announcing he would introduce a bill to the U.S. House that would lift the ban on federal money for subway tunneling in the district. This bill passed the House via unanimous vote on September 20, 2006.

In a letter to the Los Angeles Times, Waxman cites the 2005 study: &quot; The panel concurred as well that in 1985, the decision to hold further tunneling in abeyance was prudent, given the circumstances and extent of information and technology at that time. Much has changed since then to significantly improve tunneling and operation safety. &quot; [ http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-le-tuesday3.1jan03%2C1%2C2281424.story?ctrack%3D1%26amp%3Bcset%3Dtrue http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/953695751.html?dids%3D953695751%26amp%3BFMT%3DABS%26amp%3BFMTS%3DFT 2006-01-03 The facts about Red Line safety Henry Waxman 2006-01-03 Los Angeles Times ] In January 2011, Republicans became the majority party again in the House, ending Democratic chairmanships. Waxman had a reputation for a vigorous approach to oversight long before becoming ranking Democrat on what was then the Government Reform Committee in 1997. He was well known for insisting that witnesses appearing before his subcommittee testify under oath, thus exposing them to perjury charges if they didn&apos;t tell the truth. For example, in 1994, he forced the chief executives of the seven major tobacco companies to swear under oath that nicotine was not addictive.

He further said that the &quot; Jewish values &quot; of &quot; human rights, social justice, and equal opportunities... are synonymous with American values, &quot; and that such values &quot; are in my opinion closer to a Democratic position. &quot; Waxman supported fellow representative Jane Harman during her primary challenge from Marcy Winograd when Winograd said she would support a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, instead of the two-state resolution endorsed by Waxman and Harman. Saying it suffers from &quot; a culture of corruption &quot; and &quot; has become obsessed with secrecy, &quot; he accused the American government of having abandoned these values. &quot; (The) Republican leadership ignores presidential rules and norms and has no consideration for custom, &quot; he said.
