Weather. Retrieved on 27 June 2008. } Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, { Glossary of Meteorology. Hydrosphere. Retrieved on 27 June 2008. } { Glossary of Meteorology. Troposphere. Retrieved on 27 June 2008. } just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. [ Climate Glossary of Meteorology American Meteorological Society http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id%3Dclimate1 14 May 2008 ] When used without qualification, &quot; weather &quot; is understood to be the weather of Earth. Weather is driven by density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclone s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth&apos;s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth&apos;s surface, temperatures usually range ±40  °C (100  °F to −40  °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth&apos;s orbit affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate and global climate change. Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The atmosphere is a chaotic system, so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns. Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter &apos;s Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star&apos;s corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind. [ Cause ] { Stratocumulus perlucidus clouds } On Earth,such as selena common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storm s. Less common events include natural disaster s such as tornado es, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.

Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA) 18 October 2001 ] Weather occurs primarily due to density (temperature and moisture ) differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics you lie, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due to the indirect sunlight. { NASA.

Retrieved on 28 June 2008. } Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoon s or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes. Because the Earth&apos;s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate ). { Windows to the Universe. Earth&apos;s Tilt Is the Reason for the Seasons! Retrieved on 28 June 2008. } This effect causes seasons.

Donald Ahrens Meteorology Today Brooks/Cole Publishing 8th 2006 0-495-01162-2 224863929 ] On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface heats the air above it and the air expands, lowering the air pressure and its density. { Michel Moncuquet. Relation between density and temperature.

[ Modification ] The aspiration to control the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail. { American Meteorological Society } A recent example of weather control was China&apos;s preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of Beijing in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province, to the southwest and Beijing&apos;s Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.

Anthropogenic pollutants reduce air quality and visibility.
