[ History ] [ Last battle between two Iowa American Indian tribes ] Nearby Avery’s Hill was the site of a significant event in Iowa history. The last battle between two American Indian tribes in Iowa was fought on this hill in 1854 between the Sioux and the Winnebagos. Some eighteen Sioux warriors under the leadership of Coustawa (Big Tree) surprised the tribe of Winnebago but were driven back after the death of Coustawa. One of the Sioux warriors was reported to be Inkpaduta, who later led a band of Sioux in the famed Spirit Lake Massacre. The Pocahontas County Historical Society has marked the battle spot on the former Clarence Stearns farm with a flag pole and plaque memorial. [ http://iagenweb.org/humboldt/history/averyhill.htm Humboldt County Town Histories Bradgate, Avery Township Avery Hill IaGenWeb March 25, 2011 ] A few area residents of Bradgate and surrounding community have acquired large collections of American Indian artifacts, including arrowheads, discovered during walks along the river and on Avery’s Hill. [ The early days and origin of name ] The first settlement just east of present Bradgate (Section 8) was named Willow Glen with no record of why this name was chosen. However, when the town was platted, the name was changed to Bradgate. Several theories are given as to why this name was chosen but the one accepted by most is that Bradgate was named for Bradgate Park, England, which is just up the river from Rutland, England, and likewise in Humboldt County. There were at least seven English families who left England and moved directly to the Bradgate, Iowa, area. Bradgate was plat ted by the Western Town Lot Company in 1881-1882 on the Toledo branch of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad in Avery Township of Humboldt County. { Dilts, Harold E. (1993) From Ackley to Zwingle: The Origin of Iowa Place Names, p. 50. Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, ISBN 0-8138-0837-5 } The plat was filed for record on March 7, 1882. The post office was established April 7, 1882. { Patera, Alan H. and Gallagher, John S. Iowa Post Offices, 1833-1986, p. 89. Lake Oswego, Oregon: The Depot } Cord N. King came to Avery Township in 1864 and purchased 247 acres. He farmed this land and operated a grocery store. Much of the land was donated to the railroad by Cord N. King. It was hoped that the terminal would be built at this spot, but after the entire valley of the Des Moines River flooded on July 7, 1881, it was decided to move the terminal to Eagle Grove. John Wesley King built a house near the post office and became the town’s first postmaster. [ &quot; The town that wouldn’t die &quot; ] In the summer of 1950, three people from &apos;&apos;Life Magazine&apos;&apos; spent a number of days in Bradgate taking numerous pictures and interviewing nearly everyone for a special profile on a small Iowa town. When the article came to be published, residents were anxious to read the story which profiled their farm community. But when the August 1950 issue appeared, all were disappointed. Bradgate was pictured as a dying town. [ http://iagenweb.org/humboldt/history/life_magazine.htm A Iowa Town Dies a Slow Death &apos;&apos;Life Magazine&apos;&apos; August 28, 1950 93–97 March 26, 2011 ] This has remained a sore spot in the years since and in 1976, the motto “The town that wouldn’t die” was chosen to commemorate the community’s resolve to withstand the dire premonition and continue forward.

MidAmerican Energy power lines and poles, from Rutland north to the Bradgate blacktop, were toppled over the roadway.

Avery, the area&apos;s first settler who came to farm. The hill is a haven for nature, wildlife, and mushroom hunts. Avery built his house in November 1859 and planted corn the following spring. Avery’s Hill has become synonymous as a wildlife refuge and a place where several generations of area youngsters have enjoyed sledding or tobogganing down the large expansive hill. During the 1920s, an effort was unsuccessfully made to make Avery’s Hill into a park. In 1976, after private ownership of the land had changed hands, an effort was successfully made to prevent further tilling and destruction of the scenic area. The hill was the site of a significant event in Iowa history. The last battle between two American Indian tribes in Iowa was fought on this hill in 1854 between the Sioux and the Winnebagos.
