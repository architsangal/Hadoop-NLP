AFP is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal development that is thought to be the fetal form of serum albumin. AFP binds to copper, nickel, fatty acid s and bilirubin and is found in monomeric, dimeric and trimeric forms. [ Structure ] AFP is a glycoprotein of 591 amino acids [ Pucci P, Siciliano R, Malorni A, Marino G, Tecce MF, Ceccarini C, Terrana B Human alpha-fetoprotein primary structure: a mass spectrometric study Biochemistry 30 20 5061–6 1991 May 1709810 10.1021/bi00234a032 ] and a carbohydrate moiety. [ Seregni E, Botti C, Bombardieri E Biochemical characteristics and clinical applications of alpha-fetoprotein isoforms Anticancer Res. 15 4 1491–9 1995 7544570 ] [ Function ] AFP is the most abundant plasma protein found in the human fetus. Plasma levels decrease rapidly after birth but begin decreasing prenatally starting at the end of the first trimester. Normal adult levels are usually achieved by the age of 8 to 12 months. The function of AFP in adults is unknown; however, in rodent fetuses it binds estradiol to prevent the transport of this hormone across the placenta. The main function of this is to prevent the masculinization of female fetuses. As human AFP does not bind estrogen, its function in human fetuses is less clear. [ Becker JB Behavioral Endocrinology Neuroendocrinology of sexual behavior in the female Carter CS MIT Press Cambridge, Mass 2002 88-89 0-262-52321-3 http://books.google.se/books?id%3DD6TnKbTRBJoC%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA88%26amp%3Bots%3DjgmtzhDR8p%26amp%3Bdq%3DAFP%20binds%20maternal%20estrogen%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA88#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3DAFP%20binds%20maternal%20estrogen%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse ] The rodent AFP system can be overridden with massive injections of estrogen, which swamp the AFP system and will masculinize the fetus. The masculinizing effect of estrogens may seem counter-intuitive since estrogens are critical for the proper development of female secondary characteristics during puberty. However, this is not the case prenatally. Gonadal hormones from the testes, such as testosterone and antimullerian hormone are required to cause development of a phenotypic male. Without these hormones the fetus will develop into a phenotypic female even if genetically XY. Interestingly, the conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase in many tissues may be an important step in masculinization of that tissue. [ Nef S, Parada LF Hormones in male sexual development Genes Dev. 14 24 3075–86 2000 December 11124800 10.1101/gad.843800 ] [ Elbrecht A, Smith RG Aromatase enzyme activity and sex determination in chickens. Science 1992 255 5043 467-70 1734525 10.1126/science.1734525 ] Masculinization of the brain is thought to occur both by conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase, but also by de novo synthesis of estrogens within the brain.

[ Serum levels ] [ Elevated alpha-fetoprotein ] [ Maternal ] In pregnant women, fetal AFP levels can be monitored in urine. AFP is cleared strongly from the kidneys allowing AFP to tend to mirror fetal serum levels. In contrast, maternal serum AFP levels are much lower but continue to rise until about week 32. This is thought to be because the mother is not utilising the AFP, and therefore clears it from her system without issue. [ Infants ] The normal range of AFP for adults and children is variously reported as under 50, under 10, and under 5  ng/mL. [ Ball D, Rose E, Alpert E Alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal adults Am.
