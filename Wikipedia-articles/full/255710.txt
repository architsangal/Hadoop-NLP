The words &quot; kawaii &quot; have the root word &quot; kawai &quot; which is formed from the kanji &quot; ka &quot; ( 可 ), meaning &quot; acceptable &quot;, and &quot; ai &quot; ( 愛 ), meaning &quot; love &quot;. The term kawaii has taken on the secondary meanings of &quot; cool &quot;, &quot; groovy &quot;, &quot; acceptable &quot;, &quot; desirable &quot;, &quot; charming &quot; { Shiokawa. &quot; Cute But Deadly: Women and Violence in Japanese Comics &quot;.

[ Aesthetics ] Sōichi Masubuchi [ 増渕聡一 Masubuchi Sōichi ] in his work, Kawaii Syndrome, claims &quot; cute &quot; and &quot; neat &quot; have taken precedence over the former Japanese aesthetics of &quot; beautiful &quot; and &quot; refined &quot;. [ Gender performance ] Japanese women who feign cute behaviors (e.g., high-pitched voice, squealing giggles [ Merry White The material child: coming of age in Japan and America http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dvom1N-653voC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA129 19 July 2011 29 September 1994 University of California Press 978-0-520-08940-2 129 ] ) that could be viewed as forced or inauthentic are called burikko and this is considered a gender performance. { &quot; You are doing burikko!: Censoring/scrutinizing artificers of cute femininity in Japanese, &quot; Laura Miller in Gender, and Ideology: Cultural Models and Real People, edited by Janet Shibamoto Smith and Shigeko Okamoto, Oxford University Press, 2004. In Japanese. } The term [ burikko 鰤子 ] is formed with buri ( 鰤, literally ‘ amberjack ’ a fish), a pun on furi ( 振, ‘to pretend or pose’), [ Mitsubishi Shōji Kabushiki Kaisha Tatemae and honne: distinguishing between good form and real intention in Japanese business culture http://books.google.com/books?id%3DcXwEAQAAIAAJ 25 April 1988 Free Press 978-0-02-921591-3 67 A similar word in vogue today is burikko, which is a contraction of &quot; a girl (ko) who puts on (furi= buri) a cute pose. &quot; ] and ko ( 子, ‘child’). It was a neologism developed in the 1980s by singer Kuniko Yamada [ 山田邦子 Yamada Kuniko ]. [ Physical attractiveness ] In Japan, cuteness is expected of men and women. There is a trend of men shaving their legs to mimic the &quot; asexual &quot; look. Many Japanese men are drawn to the owner of cute merchandise, because it is reminiscent of little girls, and Japanese women try to act cute to attract men. A study by Kanebo, a cosmetic company, found that Japanese women in their 20s and 30s favored the &quot; cute look &quot; with a &quot; childish round face &quot;. [ History ] [ Original definition ] The original definition of kawaii came from Lady Murasaki&apos;s The Tale of Genji where it referred to pitiable qualities. During the Shogunate period under the ideology of neo-Confucianism, women came to be included under the term kawaii as the perception of women being animalistic was replaced with the conception of women as docile. [ Cute handwriting ] The rise of cuteness in Japanese culture emerged in the 1970s as part of a new style of writing. { Kinsella, Sharon. 1995. &quot; Cuties in Japan &quot; accessed August 1, 2009. } Many teenage girls began to write laterally using mechanical pencils. These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional Japanese writing that varied in thickness and was vertical. Also, the girls would write in big, round characters and they added little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, smiley faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet. These pictures would be inserted randomly and made the writing very hard to read. As a result, this writing style caused a lot of controversy and was banned in many schools. During the 1980s, however, this new &quot; cute &quot; writing was adopted by magazines and comics and was put onto packaging and advertising. From 1984–1986, Kazuma Yamane [ 山根和麻 Yamane Kazuma ] studied the development of cute handwriting, which he called Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting, in depth. This type of cute Japanese handwriting has also been called: [ marui ji 丸い 字 ], meaning &quot; round writing &quot;, [ koneko ji 小猫 字 ], meaning &quot; kitten writing &quot;, [ manga ji 漫画 字 ], meaning &quot; comic writing &quot;, and [ burikko ji 鰤 子 字 ], meaning &quot; fake-child writing &quot;. { Skov, L.(1995). Women, media, and consumption in Japan. Hawai&apos;i Press, USA. } Although it was commonly thought that the writing style was something that teenagers had picked up from comics, he found that teenagers had come up with the style themselves, as part of an underground movement. [ Cute fashion ] Tomoyuki Sugiyama [ 杉山奉文 Sugiyama Tomoyuki ], author of Cool Japan, claims cute fashion in Japan can be traced back to the Edo Period with the popularity of netsuke. { TheAge.Com: &quot; Japan smitten by love of cute &quot; http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/cool-or-infantile/2006/06/18/1150569208424.html } Because of this growing trend, companies such as Sanrio came out with merchandise like Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as Seiko Matsuda, who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls. { See URL accessed February 11, 2009. } The market for cute merchandise in Japan is driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old. { Time Asia: Young Japan: She&apos;s a material girl http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990503/style1.html } No longer limited to teenagers, however, the spread of making things as cute as possible, even common household items, was embraced by people of all ages. Now there are airplanes painted with Pokémon characters on the side, and each of Japan ’s 47 prefectures, the Tokyo police, and even the public broadcaster NHK all have their own cute mascots. Domokun, the unique-looking and widely recognized NHK mascot, was introduced in 1998 and quickly took on a life of its own, appearing in Internet memes and fan art around the world. Currently, Sanrio’s line of more than 50 characters takes in more than $1 billion a year and it remains the most successful company to capitalize on the cute trend.

WIRED December 1999 ] Many companies, large and small, use cute mascots to present their wares and services to the public. For example: [ January 2010 ] Pikachu, a character from Pokémon, adorns the side of three ANA passenger jets. Kirby, the main character from Nintendo&apos;s Kirby video game series.

URL accessed April 19, 2006. they also use other cute mascot characters to promote their various services (among them the Postal Savings Bank) and have used many such on postage stamps. Some police forces in Japan have their own moe mascots, which sometimes adorn the front of kōban (police boxes). Sanrio, the company behind Hello Kitty and other similarly cute characters, runs the Sanrio Puroland theme park in Tokyo. Cute can be also used to describe a specific fashion sense { Time Asia: &quot; Arts: Kwest For Kawaii &quot;.

Ruffles and pastel colors are commonly (but not always) featured, and accessories often include toys or bags featuring anime characters. [ Cute products ] Kawaii goods outlet in 100 yen shop This concept of &apos;kawaii&apos; has had an influence on a variety of products, such as Hi-Chew, Koala&apos;s March and Hello Panda.

[ April 2012 ] Cabbage Patch Kids dolls did not sell well in Japan, because the Japanese considered their facial features to be &quot; ugly &quot; and &quot; grotesque &quot; compared to the flatter and almost featureless face of Hello Kitty. Also, Barbie did not become successful in Japan compared to the Rika-chan doll who was modeled after a pre-pubescent girl. [ Perception in Japan ] { Shinkansen E3 Series train with } { Pokémon decorations. } As a cultural phenomenon, cuteness is increasingly accepted in Japan as a part of Japanese culture and national identity. Tomoyuki Sugiyama [ 杉山奉文 Sugiyama Tomoyuki ], author of &quot; Cool Japan &quot;, believes that &quot; cuteness &quot; is rooted in Japan&apos;s harmony-loving culture, and Nobuyoshi Kurita [ 栗田経惟 Kurita Nobuyoshi ], a sociology professor at Musashi University in Tokyo, has stated that &quot; cute &quot; is a &quot; magic term &quot; that encompasses everything that&apos;s acceptable and desirable in Japan. { Quotes and paraphrases from: } [ Cuteness a hot-selling commodity in Japan Yuri Kageyama June 14, 2006 Associated Press http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061401122.html ] [ Influence on other cultures ] Kawaii products are seemingly gaining more popularity beyond the borders of Japan into other Asian markets and it&apos;s seemingly becoming more popular in the US especially among the young anime and manga fans as well as among those who are influenced by the Japanese culture. Cute merchandise and products are especially popular in some other parts of East Asia, such as China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and South-East Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. { Cute Power!

The dissemination of Japanese youth fashion and “kawaii culture” is usually associated with the western society and trends set by western designers borrowed or taken from Japan With the emergence of China, South Korea, and even Singapore as economic centers in Asia, the Kawaii merchandise and product popularity has shifted back to the east. In these Asian markets, the kawaii concept takes on various forms and different types of presentation depending on the target audience. Taiwan culture, in particular government, has embraced and elevated kawaii to a new level of social consciousness. The introduction of the A-Bian doll was seen as the development of a symbol to advance democracy and assist in constructing a collective imagination and national identity for Taiwanese. The A-Bian dolls are kawaii likeness of sports figure, famous individuals, and now political figures that use kawaii images as a means of self-promotion and potential votes. { [1]A-Bian Family. http://www.akibo.com.tw/home/gallery/mark/03.htm } The creation of the A-Bian doll has allowed Taiwanese President Chen staffers to create a new culture where the &quot; kawaii &quot; image of a politician can be used to mobilize supports, and gain election votes. { Chuang, Y.

The emergence of Japanese culture can be traced back to the mid-1980s when Japan became one of the economic powers in the world. Kawaii has developed from a few kid television shows to an internet sensation. { [2]All things Kawaii. http://www.allthingskawaii.net/links/ } Japanese media is used so abundantly in Singapore that youths are more likely to imitate the fashion of their Japanese idols, learn the Japanese language, and continue purchasing Japanese oriented merchandise. { Hao, X., Teh, L.L.

Kawaii has taken on a life of its own, spawning the formation of kawaii websites, kawaii home pages and finally kawaii social networking pages. { [3]World of Kawaii. http://www.etsy.com/shop/worldofkawaii } While Japan is the origin and Mecca of all things being kawaii, artist and businesses around the world are imitating the kawaii theme. { Rutledge, B.

The interconnectedness of today’s world via the internet has taken kawaii to new heights of exposure and acceptance, producing a kawaii “movement”. The popularity of kawaii and kawaii products have become a part of the “world’s culture” The Kawaii concept has become something of a global phenomenon. The aesthetic cuteness of Japan is very appealing to people globally. The wide popularity of Japanese kawaii is often credited with it being “culturally odorless.” The elimination of exoticism and national branding has helped kawaii to reach numerous target audiences and to span every culture, class, and gender group. { Shearin, M.
