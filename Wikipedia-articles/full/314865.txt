{ Harlequins } { Leicester Tigers } { 9 } { 2011–12 } { ITV 4 (Highlights only) } { Sky Sports } { ESPN UK } The English Premiership, also currently known as the Aviva Premiership because of the league&apos;s sponsorship by Aviva, { Premiership Rugby announce long term partnership with Aviva Premiership Rugby, 7 July 2010 } is a professional league competition for rugby union football clubs in the top division of the English rugby union system. There are twelve clubs in the Premiership. The competition has been played since 1987, and has evolved into the current Premiership system employing relegation to and promotion from the RFU Championship, known as National Division One before the 2009–10 season. Clubs competing in the Aviva Premiership qualify for Europe&apos;s two club competitions, the Heineken Cup and the European Challenge Cup. The current champions are Harlequins. The most recently promoted side is Worcester Warriors, who returned to the top flight at their first opportunity after defeating Cornish Pirates in the RFU Championship Final on 18 May 2011, while Leeds Carnegie returned to the second tier after two seasons in the Premiership. [ History ] [ September 2007 ] See also History of the English rugby union system [ Beginnings: English domestic rugby union until 1972 ] The governing body of rugby union in England, Rugby Football Union (RFU), long resisted leagues as it was believed that leagues would increase &apos;dirty&apos; play and put pressure on clubs to pay their players (thus breaking the amateur ethos). Instead, clubs arranged their own friendlies and had traditional games. The only organised tournaments were the County Cups and County Championship — the former played by clubs and the latter by County representative teams. The Daily Telegraph and a few local newspapers — such as the Yorkshire Post — compiled &apos;pennants&apos; based on teams&apos; performances, but as the strength of fixture lists varied, it was at best an estimate of a team&apos;s performance throughout a season. [ Cups and Leagues: 1972–1995 ] In 1972 the RFU sanctioned a national knock-out cup — the R.F.U. Club Competition, the predecessor to today&apos;s Anglo-Welsh Cup — followed first by regional merit tables and then, in the mid 1980s, by national merit tables. One of the casualties of the move to competitive leagues was the loss of traditional games as the new fixture lists did not allow enough time for them. The league system has evolved since its start in 1987 when the Courage Leagues were formed — a league pyramid with roughly 1000 clubs playing in 108 leagues each with promotion and relegation. In the first season, clubs were expected to arrange the fixtures on mutually convenient dates. The clubs involved were Bath, Bristol, Coventry, Gloucester, Harlequins, Leicester, Moseley, Nottingham, Orrell, Sale, Wasps and Waterloo. That first season was an unqualified success, with clubs in the upper echelons of the national leagues reporting increased crowds, interest from both local backers and national companies as well as higher skill levels among players exposed to regular competition. The fears that leagues would lead to greater violence on the field proved largely unfounded. By the next season, the RFU allocated fixed Saturdays to the league season, removing the clubs&apos; responsibility for scheduling matches. There was no home and away structure to the leagues in those early seasons, as sides played one another only once. Initially two teams, Bath and Leicester, proved to be head and shoulders above the rest in the Courage League, and between them dominated the top of the table. In 1994 the league structure expanded to include a full rota of home and away matches for the first time. The 1994–95 season was the first to be shown live on Sky Sports, a relationship which continues to this day. [ 1996: The dawn of Professional Rugby Union ] The league turned professional for the 1996/97 season when the first winners were London Wasps, joining Bath and Leicester as the only champions in the league&apos;s first decade. Clubs like Saracens, Newcastle and Northampton were able to attract wealthy benefactors, but the professional era also had its casualties, as clubs like West Hartlepool, Richmond and London Scottish were forced into administration when their backers pulled out. [ 2000 to 2002: Zurich Premiership, Zurich Championship and the zurich Playoffs ] The re-branding of the league to the Zurich Premiership at the start 2000–01 season also brought with it a re-vamping of the season structure. In 2000–2001 an 8-team play-off (the Zurich Championship) was introduced. However, the team finishing top of the table at the end of the regular season was still considered English champions ( &quot; Zurich Premiership title &quot; ). Half-way through the 2001–02 season, with Leicester odds-on to win their fourth title in succession, it was controversially decided that the winners of the 8-team playoffs would be crowned English champions. [ http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/leicester-livid-as-seasons-spoils-are-left-up-for-grabs-691178.html Leicester livid as seasons spoils are left up for grabs 10 February 2001 The Independent 28 January 2009 ] There was an outcry from fans and this proposal was dropped. [ The Ascendancy of the Playoffs: 2003 – present ] From the beginning of the 2002 -03 season, a new playoff format was introduced to replace the 8-team Zurich Championship. The format required the first placed team in the league to play the winner of a match between the second- and third-placed teams. Critically, the winner of this game (the Premiership Final) would be recognised as English champions. Although Gloucester won the league by a clear margin, they then faced a three week wait until the final. Having lost their momentum the second-placed Wasps (who had defeated third-placed Northampton) beat them easily in the play-offs. The playoff structure was reformatted in the 2005–06 season in which the first placed team would play the fourth placed team in a semi-final (a Shaughnessy playoff ). Since the implementation of the playoff system, Only three teams have won both the regular season and playoffs in the same year; Leicester in 2000–01 (the first year of the playoffs) and again in 2008–09 and 2009–10, Sale Sharks in 2005–06 &amp; the Harlequins (in their first ever premiership final) 2011-12.Of all the Premiership teams, London Wasps have made a reputation for playing the competition format to perfection, peaking at the right time to be crowned English Champions in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008. Wasps did not lead the league standings at the end of the season in any of these years. Indeed, the London club have not finished top of the league since the playoffs began.Conversely, Gloucester Rugby have garnered an unfortunate reputation for leading the table at the end of the regular season, only to fall short of winning the Premiership title in 2003, 2007 and 2008. Gloucester&apos;s single victory in the playoffs, in 2002, occurred when the league leaders, in that season Leicester, were still considered English champions, Gloucester&apos;s Zurich Championship victory being considered secondary.The 2011-12 season saw Harlequins add their name to the trophy on their first attempt wining 30-23 against the nine times champions Leicester. With their first ever English Premiership title, they are only the 6th club to win the Premiership since its creation in 1997, joining the likes of Newcastle Falcons, London Wasps, Leicester Tigers, Sale Sharks and London Saracens. [ Other season highlights ] Since 2004, the season has begun with the London Double Header. On 27 December 2008 Harlequins moved their home match against Leicester Tigers across the road to Twickenham Stadium in what was dubbed &apos; The Big Game &apos;. 50,000 spectators attended (a Premiership record) and this was repeated at Christmas 2010 after successfully holding another in 2009. &apos;The Big Game 3&apos; was held between Harlequins and London Irish, where Harlequins won. The game also had the years X-Factor winner Matt Cardle, and the runner up perform before the game, and at half time. On 24 April 2010, Wasps also moved their home match with Bath to Twickenham for the St George&apos;s Day game in support of Help for Heroes.This was repeated in 2011 and resulted in Bath thrashing Wasps 43–10. [ Competition ] [ Format ] The Aviva Premiership regular season runs from September to May and comprises 22 rounds of matches, with each club playing each of its rivals home and away. During a Premiership match, points that contribute to team standings can be earned in a number of ways: 4 points are awarded for a win 2 points are awarded for a draw 1 additional (bonus) point is awarded to a team that loses a match by 7 points or fewer 1 additional (bonus) point is awarded to a team scoring 4 tries or more in a match After the completion of the 22 regular season rounds, the final standings of the twelve clubs determine which teams enter the finals – the top four clubs in the standings enter the semi-finals. The club that finishes at the top of the table earns a home game in their semi-final against the fourth-placed club. The club that finishes second in the standings also earns a home semi-final, hosting the third-placed club. The two semi-finals are played in May, with the winners of both games entering the championship final, which is played at Twickenham Stadium. The winner of the final are the season champions. [ Promotion and relegation ] See also English rugby union system There is a system of promotion and relegation to and from the Aviva Premiership. The last placed club after the 22 regular season rounds of the Premiership is relegated into the RFU Championship (the former National Division One), while the winner of the Championship play offs is promoted to the Premiership for the subsequent season. However, promotion and relegation is subject to a Minimum Standards Criteria. If the winner of the play offs does not meet these standards, then there is no relegation/promotion, as would have been the case in the most recent season (2010–11) if Cornish Pirates had defeated Worcester. They did not, confirming Leeds&apos; relegation and Worcester&apos;s return to the Premiership. [ European competitions ] Teams playing in the Aviva Premiership also compete in the two European Rugby Cup competitions: the Heineken Cup and the Amlin Challenge Cup. England is entitled to six Heineken Cup places each season, with the possibility of a seventh depending on performances of English clubs in the prior season. The top four placed clubs in the Aviva Premiership qualify for the Heineken Cup, though more clubs can qualify in a number of ways: the previous season&apos;s Heineken Cup winner, the champion of the European Challenge Cup or the winner of the LV Cup (officially &quot; LV= &quot; per the sponsor&apos;s branding). More precisely, Premiership Rugby nominates clubs for the Heineken Cup in the following order, skipping any places occupied by clubs that are either outside the Premiership or qualified in a prior step: [ http://www.premiershiprugby.com/information/structure.php Premiership Structure Premiership Rugby: Information Premiership Rugby 12 June 2011 ] Heineken Cup holder Challenge Cup holder Premiership champion Premiership runner-up Premiership semi-finalists (2 teams) Anglo-Welsh Cup holder Fifth-, sixth, and seventh-place teams, in that order, until the Premiership&apos;s Heineken Cup allocation is filled As an example, the Premiership&apos;s seven 2011–12 Heineken Cup places were filled as follows, based on 2010–11 season results: Skipped— 2010–11 Heineken Cup won by Leinster of the Celtic League Harlequins as 2010–11 Challenge Cup winners (1). Note that Quins&apos; Challenge Cup victory gave England an extra Heineken Cup berth. Saracens (2) Leicester Tigers (3) Gloucester (4) and Northampton Saints (5) Skipped— 2010–11 LV= Cup winners Gloucester qualified as Premiership semi-finalists Bath as fifth-place team (6) and London Irish as sixth-place team (7) Following changes to European qualification rules that took effect in the 2009–10 season, the winners of the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup receive berths in the following year&apos;s Heineken Cup, which will not usually count against the Premiership&apos;s allocation. However, the number of English teams in the Heineken Cup is capped at seven. If Premiership clubs win both European trophies during a given season, only five other clubs can earn Heineken Cup berths through the league or LV= Cup. Seven Premiership clubs will compete in the Heineken Cup if either of the following occurs: A Premiership club wins either of the previous season&apos;s European trophies Both European trophies in the previous season were won by clubs from France (which is also capped at seven Heineken Cup teams), and the club that stands highest in the European Rugby Club Rankings among those not already qualified for the Heineken Cup is English. The same scenario also applies if one of Scotland&apos;s two professional clubs, which are automatically entered in the Heineken Cup, wins a European trophy. All clubs that do not qualify for the Heineken Cup play in the European Challenge Cup.
