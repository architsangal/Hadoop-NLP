[ fiction Extraterrestrials in fiction ] [ Astrobiology Alien (disambiguation) ] { Soviet Union 16 } { kopeks } { postage stamp, depicting a } { satellite from an imagined extraterrestrial civilization } Extraterrestrial life (from the Latin words: extra [ &quot; beyond &quot;, or &quot; not of &quot; ] and‎ terrestris [ &quot; of or belonging to Earth &quot; ]) is defined as life that does not originate from Earth. Referred to as alien life, or simply aliens (or space aliens, to differentiate from other definitions of alien or aliens) these hypothetical forms of life range from simple bacteria -like organisms to beings far more complex than human s. The development and testing of hypotheses on extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology or astrobiology; the term astrobiology, however, includes the study of life on Earth viewed in its astronomical context. Many scientists consider extraterrestrial life to be plausible, but little evidence has yet been found. [ Background ] [ biology Has life developed on other planets? ] Alien life, such as bacteria, has been hypothesized to exist in the Solar System and throughout the universe. This hypothesis relies on the vast size and consistent physical law s of the observable universe. According to this argument, made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere other than Earth.

Life may have emerged independently at many places throughout the Universe. Alternatively life may form less frequently, then spread between habitable planet s through panspermia or exogenesis.

The response noted &quot; odds are pretty high &quot; that there may be life on other planets but &quot; the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any intelligent ones —are extremely small, given the distances involved. &quot; [ Possible basis ] Several hypotheses have been proposed about the possible basis of alien life from a biochemical, evolution ary or morphological viewpoint. [ Biochemistry ] [ Biochemistry Hypothetical types of biochemistry Water and life ] All life on Earth is based upon 26 chemical element s. However, about 95% of this life is built upon only six of these elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur, abbreviated CHNOPS. These six elements form the basic building blocks of virtually all life on Earth, while most of the remaining elements are found in only trace amounts. [ Lucas John Mix 2009 Life in space: astrobiology for everyone 76 Harvard University Press 0-674-03321-3 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DA60E-v4Sr-gC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA76 2011-08-08 ] Life on Earth requires water as the solvent in which biochemical reactions take place. Sufficient quantities of carbon and the other elements along with water, may enable the formation of living organisms on other planets with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth. [ Norman R. Pace January 20, 2001 The universal nature of biochemistry Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A. 98 3 805 –808 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 11158550 2001PNAS...98..805P 33372 ] Terrestrial planets, such as Earth, are formed in a process that allows for the possibility of having compositions similar to Earth&apos;s. [ Bond Jade C. O&apos;Brien David P. Lauretta Dante S. The Compositional Diversity of Extrasolar Terrestrial Planets. I.

Plant s derive energy through the conversion of light energy into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Life, as currently recognized, requires carbon in both reduced (methane derivatives) and partially oxidized ( carbon oxide s ) states. Nitrogen is needed as a reduced ammonia derivative in all protein s, sulfur as a derivative of hydrogen sulfide in some necessary proteins, and phosphorus oxidized to phosphate s in genetic material and in energy transfer. Pure water is useful because it has a neutral pH due to its continued dissociation between hydroxide and hydronium ions. As a result, it can dissolve both positive metallic ions and negative non-metallic ions with equal ability. Furthermore, the fact that organic molecules can be either hydrophobic (repelled by water) or hydrophilic (soluble in water) creates the ability of organic compounds to orient themselves to form water-enclosing membranes. Additionally, the hydrogen bond s between water molecules give it an ability to store energy with evaporation, which upon condensation is released. This helps to moderate the climate, cooling the tropics and warming the poles, helping to maintain the thermodynamic stability needed for life. Carbon is fundamental to terrestrial life for its immense flexibility in creating covalent chemical bonds with a variety of non-metallic elements, principally nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide and water together enable the storage of solar energy in sugars, such as glucose. The oxidation of glucose releases biochemical energy needed to fuel all other biochemical reactions. The ability to form organic acid s (–COOH) and amine bases (–NH 2 ) gives rise to the possibility of neutralization dehydrating reactions to build long polymer peptides and catalytic proteins from monomer amino acids. When combined with phosphate s, these acids can build the information-storing molecule of inheritance, DNA, and the principal energy transfer molecule of cellular life, ATP. Due to their relative abundance and usefulness in sustaining life, many have hypothesized that life forms elsewhere in the universe would utilize these basic materials. However, other elements and solvents could provide a basis for life. Silicon is most often deemed to be the probable alternative to carbon. [ August 2011 ] Silicon life forms are proposed to have a crystalline morphology, and are hypothesized to be able to exist in high temperatures, such as on planets which are very close to their star. [ August 2011 ] Life forms based in ammonia (rather than water) have been suggested, though this solution appears less optimal than water. [ http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html daviddarling.info Ammonia-based life ] From a chemical perspective, life is fundamentally a self-replicating reaction, but one which could arise under a great many conditions and with various possible ingredients, though carbon-oxygen within the liquid temperature range of water seems most conducive. Suggestions have even been made that self-replicating reactions of some sort could occur within the plasma of a star, though it would be highly unconventional. [ http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/etlifevar.html daviddarling.info extraterrestrial life, variety of ] Several pre-conceived ideas about the characteristics of life outside of Earth have been questioned. For example, a NASA scientist suggested that the color of photosynthesizing pigments of hypothetical life on extrasolar planet s might not be green. [ Rob Gutro NASA Predicts Non-Green Plants on Other Planets 4 November 2007 NASA http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/spectrum_plants.html Goddard Space Flight Center 2011-02-18 ] [ Evolution and morphology ] In addition to the biochemical basis of extraterrestrial life, many have considered evolution and morphology. Science fiction has often depicted extraterrestrial life with humanoid and/or reptilian forms. Aliens have often been depicted as having light green or grey skin, with a large head, as well as four limbs—i.e. fundamentally humanoid. Other subjects, such as felines, insect s, blobs, etc., have occurred in fictional representations of aliens. A division has been suggested between universal and parochial (narrowly restricted) characteristics. Universals are features which are thought to have evolved independently more than once on Earth (and thus, presumably, are not too difficult to develop) and are so intrinsically useful that species will inevitably tend towards them. The most fundamental of these is probably bilateral symmetry, but more complex (though still basic) characteristics include flight, sight, photosynthesis and limbs, all of which are thought to have evolved several times here on Earth. There is a huge variety of eye s, for example, and many of these have radically different working schematics and different visual foci: the visual spectrum, infrared, polarity and echolocation. Parochials, however, are essentially arbitrary evolutionary forms. These often have little inherent utility (or at least have a function which can be equally served by dissimilar morphology) and probably will not be replicated. Intelligent aliens could communicate through gestures, as deaf humans do, by sounds created from structures unrelated to breathing, which happens on Earth when, for instance, cicada s vibrate their wings or crickets stridulate their wings, or visually through bioluminescence or chromatophore -like structures. Attempting to define parochial features challenges many taken-for-granted notions about morphological necessity. Skeleton s, which are essential to large terrestrial organisms according to the experts of the field of gravitational biology, are almost assured to be replicated elsewhere in one form or another. The assumption of radical diversity amongst putative extraterrestrials is by no means settled. While many exobiologists do stress that the enormously heterogeneous nature of life on Earth foregrounds an even greater variety in outer space, others point out that convergent evolution may dictate substantial similarities between Earth and extraterrestrial life. These two schools of thought are called &quot; divergionism &quot; and &quot; convergionism &quot; respectively. [ Planetary habitability in the Solar System ] [ Planetary habitability Natural satellite habitability ] Some bodies in the Solar System have been suggested as having the potential for an environment that could host extraterrestrial life, particularly those with possible subsurface oceans. Though due to the lack of habitable environments beyond Earth, should life be discovered elsewhere in the Solar System, astrobiologists suggest that it more likely will be in the form of extremophile microorganism s. The planets Venus and Mars, along with several natural satellites orbiting Jupiter and Saturn, and even comets, are suspected to possess niche environments in which life might exist. A subsurface marine environment on Jupiter&apos;s moon Europa might be the most suitable habitat in the Solar System, outside of Earth, for multicellular organism s. Panspermia suggests that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the Solar System, it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth may have been seeded from elsewhere ( exogenesis ). The Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment, developed by the Planetary Society launched in 2011 was designed to test some aspect of these hypotheses, but it was destroyed along with the carrier Fobos-Grunt mission. { Universe Today, &quot; Russian Space Program Prepares for Phobos-Grunt Re-Entry &quot;, David Warmflash, 13 December 2011 } [ Venus ] Carl Sagan, David Grinspoon and Dirk Schulze-Makuch have put forward a hypothesis that microbes could exist in the stable cloud layers 50  km above the surface of Venus; the hypothesis is based on the premises of hospitable climates and chemical disequilibrium. { Venusian Cloud Colonies :: Astrobiology Magazine } [ Mars ] [ Life on Mars ] [ Water on Mars ] Life on Mars has been long speculated. Liquid water is widely thought to have existed on Mars in the past, and there may still be liquid water beneath the surface. The origin of the potential biosignature of methane in Mars atmosphere is unexplained, although abiotic hypotheses have also been proposed. { http://news.discovery.com/space/top-10-places-to-find-alien-life.html } By July 2008, laboratory tests aboard NASA&apos;s Phoenix Mars Lander had identified water in a soil sample. The lander&apos;s robotic arm delivered the sample to an instrument which identifies vapours produced by the heating of samples. Photographs from the Mars Global Surveyor from 2006 showed evidence of recent (i.e. within 10 years) flows of a liquid on Mars&apos;s frigid surface.

Scientists have suggested that heated subsurface oceans of water may exist deep under the crusts of the three outer Galilean moons — Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The EJSM/Laplace is planned to determine the habitability of these environments. However, Europa is seen as the main target for the discovery of life. [ Europa ] { Europa, could possibly harbour basic life forms. Possibility of Life on Europa } Jupiter&apos;s moon Europa has been subject to speculation of life due to the strong possibility of liquid water beneath an ice layer. Hydrothermal vent s on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the ice and could be capable of supporting multicellular microorganism s. It is also possible that Europa could support aerobic macrofauna using oxygen created by cosmic rays impacting its surface ice.

Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa’s surface can be transferred to its interior. { Phil Plait, “Huge lakes of water may exist under Europa’s ice”, “Bad Astronomy Blog” } { “SCIENTISTS FIND EVIDENCE FOR “GREAT LAKE” ON EUROPA AND POTENTIAL NEW HABITAT FOR LIFE” } [ Saturn ] While Saturn is itself considered inhospitable to life, the planet&apos;s natural satellites, Titan and Enceladus have been speculated to possess possible habitats for life. [ Titan ] [ Life on Titan ] Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is the only known moon with a significant atmosphere.

In 2008, a joint mission by NASA and the European Space Agency was announced that would have included studies of Europa. {, “Outer Planet Flagship Mission”, “Jet Propulsion Laboratory” } However, in 2011 NASA was forced to deprioritize the mission due to a lack of funding, and it is possible that the ESA will take on the mission by itself. {, “New approach for L-class mission candidates”, “ESA” } There is some limited evidence that microbial life might possibly exist (or have existed) on Mars. { Spherix: Makers of Naturlose (tagatose), a natural, low-calorie sugar made from whey that may be useful as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes } An experiment on the Viking Mars lander reported gas emissions from heated Martian soil that some argue are consistent with the presence of microbes.

Projects such as SETI are conducting an astronomical search for radio activity which would confirm the presence of intelligent life. A related suggestion is that aliens might broadcast pulsed and continuous laser signals in the optical, as well as infrared, spectrum; [ http://www.coseti.org/ The Columbus Optical SETI Observatory The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in the Optical Spectrum ] laser signals have the advantage of not &quot; smearing &quot; in the interstellar medium, and may prove more conducive to communication between the stars. While other communication techniques, including laser transmission and interstellar spaceflight, have been discussed seriously and may well be feasible, the measure of effectiveness is the amount of information communicated per unit cost. This results in radio transmission as the method of choice. Some have hypothesized that very advanced civilizations may create artificial black holes as an energy source or method of waste disposal. Thus, they suggest that the observation of a black hole with a mass of less than 3.5 solar masses, the theoretical lower mass limit for a naturally occurring black hole, would be evidence of an alien civilization. { Ray Villard, &quot; Super-Civilizations Might Live Off Black Holes &quot;, “Discovery News” } [ Extrasolar planets ] [ Extrasolar planets ] [ List of planetary systems ] Astronomers search for extrasolar planets that may be conducive to life, such as Gliese 581 c, Gliese 581 g, Gliese 581 d and OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, which have been found to have few Earth-like qualities.

The planet, known as Gliese 581 c, orbits within the habitable zone of its star Gliese 581, a red dwarf star which is 20.5 light years (194 trillion km) from the Earth. It was initially thought that this planet could contain liquid water, but recent computer simulations of the climate on Gliese 581 c by Werner von Bloh and his team at Germany&apos;s Institute for Climate Impact Research suggest that carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere would create a runaway greenhouse effect. This would warm the planet well above the boiling point of water (100 degrees Celsius /212 degrees Fahrenheit ), thus dimming the hopes of finding life.

As of [ asof ], the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia identified [ planet_count ] extrasolar planets (in [ system_count ] planetary systems and [ multiplanetsystem_count ] multiple planetary systems ); the extrasolar planets range in size from that of terrestrial planets similar to Earth to that of gas giants larger than Jupiter. [ Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php Schneider Jean 10 September 2011 2012-01-30 ] The number of observed exoplanets is expected to increase greatly in the coming years. Because the Kepler spacecraft must view three stellar transits by exoplanets before it identifies them as candidate planets, it has so far only been able to identify planets that orbit their star at a relatively quick rate. The mission is expected to continue until at least 2016, in which time many more exoplanet candidates are expected to be found. { Mike Wall,, “NASA’s Kepler Observatory to continue hunt for strange new worlds”, “The Christian Science Monitor” } Despite these successes, the transit method employed by the Kepler spacecraft requires that planetary orbits be at a small inclination to the line of sight of the observer. Due to this constraint, the probability of detecting a planet of Earth’s size and orbital radius around a distant star is just 0.47%. Thus, the number of planets we are currently able to detect is only a small fraction of the total amount of planets present within the galaxy. { “Kepler: A Search for Habitable Planets”, “NASA Ames Research Center” } [ The Drake equation ] [ Drake equation ] In 1961, University of California, Santa Cruz astronomer and astrophysicist Dr. Frank Drake devised the Drake equation. This controversial equation multiplied estimates of the following terms together: The rate of formation of suitable stars. The fraction of those stars which are orbited by planets. The number of Earth -like worlds per planetary system. The fraction of planets where intelligent life develops. The fraction of possible communicative planets. The &quot; lifetime &quot; of possible communicative civilizations. Criticism of the Drake equation follows mostly from the observation that the terms in the equation are entirely based on conjecture. Thus the equation cannot be used to draw firm conclusions of any kind. [ Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart Evolving the Alien John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ 2002 ] { Chapter 6, What does a Martian look like? } Although the Drake equation currently involves speculation about unmeasured parameters, it was not meant to be science, but intended as a way to stimulate dialogue on these topics. Then the focus becomes how to proceed experimentally. Indeed, Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference. [ http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/seti/seti_history_07.html Amir Alexander The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Short History - Part 7: The Birth of the Drake Equation ] Drake used the equation to estimate that there are approximately 10,000 planets in the Milky Way galaxy containing intelligent life with the possible capability of communicating with Earth.

It is estimated that at least ten percent of all sun-like stars have a system of planets, [ Marcy, G.; Butler, R.; Fischer, D.; et al.

Even if we assume that only one out of a billion of these stars have planets supporting life, there would be some 6.25×10 9 (billion) life-supporting planetary systems in the observable Universe. The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations is known as the Fermi paradox. [ Beliefs ] [ Ancient and medieval ideas ] [ Cosmic pluralism ] Anunciacion by Carpaccio In antiquity, it was common to assume a cosmos consisting of &quot; many worlds &quot; inhabited by intelligent, non-human life-forms, but these &quot; worlds &quot; were mythological and not informed by the heliocentric understanding of the solar system, or the understanding of the Sun as one among countless star s. { &apos;&apos;Who discovered that the Sun was a Star?&apos;&apos; Stanford Solar Center. } An example would be the fourteen loka of Hindu cosmology, or the Nine Worlds of Old Norse mythology, etc.The Sun and the Moon often appear as inhabited worlds in such contexts, or as vehicles (chariots or boats, etc.) driven by gods. The Japanese folk tale of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter (10th century) is an example of a princess of the Moon people visiting Earth. Such conceptions of a universe consisting of &quot; many worlds &quot; are found in classical Greek philosophy, and later in Christian and Jewish theology. (See exotheology.) The atomist s of Greece like Epicurus took up the idea, arguing that an infinite universe ought to have an infinity of populated worlds. Ancient Greek cosmology worked against the idea of extraterrestrial life in one critical respect, however: the geocentric Universe. Championed by Aristotle and codified by Ptolemy, it favored the Earth and Earth-life (Aristotle denied that there could be a plurality of worlds) and seemingly rendered extraterrestrial life philosophically untenable. [ July 2011 ] The Jewish Talmud states that there are at least 18,000 other worlds, but provides little elaboration on the nature of those worlds, or on whether they are physical or spiritual. Based on this, however, the 18th century exposition &quot; Sefer HaB&apos;rit &quot; posits that extraterrestrial creatures exist, and that some may well possess intelligence. It adds that humans should not expect creatures from another world to resemble earthly life any more than sea creatures resemble land animals. [ http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/318/Q1/ ohr.edu Star Struck, a letter to a Rabbi ] [ http://www.torah.org/features/secondlook/extraterrestrial.html torah.org Extraterrestrial life Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan ] Hindu beliefs of endlessly repeated cycles of life have led to descriptions of multiple worlds in existence and their mutual contacts ( Sanskrit word sampark (सम्पर्क) means &quot; contact &quot; as in Mahasamparka (महासम्पर्क) = &quot; the great contact &quot; ). According to Hindu scriptures, there are innumerable universes to facilitate the fulfillment of the separated desires of innumerable living entities. However, the purpose of such creations is to bring back the deluded souls to correct understanding about the purpose of life. Aside from the innumerable universes which are material, there is the unlimited spiritual world, where the purified living entities live with perfect conception about life and ultimate reality. The spiritually aspiring saints and devotees, as well as thoughtful men of the material world, have been getting guidance and help from these purified living entities of the spiritual world from time immemorial. [ July 2011 ] According to Ahmadiyya a more direct reference from the Quran is presented by Mirza Tahir Ahmad as a proof that life on other planets may exist according to the Quran. In his book, Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth, he quotes verse 42:29 &quot; And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and of whatever living creatures (da&apos;bbah) He has spread forth in both... &quot;; according to this verse there is life in heavens. According to the same verse &quot; And He has the power to gather them together (jam-&apos;i-him) when He will so please &quot;; indicates the bringing together the life on Earth and the life elsewhere in the Universe. The verse does not specify the time or the place of this meeting but rather states that this event will most certainly come to pass whenever God so desires. It should be pointed out that the Arabic term Jam-i-him used to express the gathering event can imply either a physical encounter or a contact through communication. { Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth, by Mirza Tahir Ahmad. Chapter; The Quran and Extraterrestrial Life } In Shia Islam the 6th Imam Ja&apos;far al-Sadiq has been quoted as saying that there are living beings on other planets.

Wiker ] at least tacitly, the idea was aberrant. In 1277, the Bishop of Paris, Étienne Tempier, did overturn Aristotle on one point: God could have created more than one world (given His omnipotence). Taking a further step, and arguing that aliens actually existed, remained rare. Notably, Cardinal Nicholas of Kues speculated about aliens on the Moon and Sun.

Once it became clear that the Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the extraterrestrial idea moved towards the scientific mainstream. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, who argued in the 16th century for an infinite Universe in which every star is surrounded by its own planetary system. Bruno wrote that other worlds &quot; have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth &quot; and, like Earth, &quot; contain animals and inhabitants &quot;. { Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l&apos;Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue } In the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita mused that &quot; if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of the Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres &quot;. [ http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm cosmovisions.com Rheita.htm ] In Baroque literature such as The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon by Cyrano de Bergerac, extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.The didactic poet Henry More took up the classical theme of the Greek Democritus in &quot; Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds &quot; (1647).In &quot; The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books &quot; (1712), Sir Richard Blackmore observed: &quot; We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place &quot;. With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested &quot; our world&apos;s sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere &quot;. Fontanelle &apos;s &quot; Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds &quot; (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker. The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. William Herschel, the discoverer of Uranus, was one of many 18th–19th century astronomers convinced that the Solar System, and perhaps others, would be well-populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed &quot; cosmic pluralism &quot; included Immanuel Kant and Benjamin Franklin. At the height of the Enlightenment, even the Sun and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants. [ 19th century ] In 1854, William Whewell, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who popularized the word scientist, speculated that Mars had seas, land and possibly life forms. [ July 2011 ] Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation by some observers of apparent Martian canal s — which were however soon found to be optical illusions. Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer Percival Lowell published his book Mars, followed by Mars and its Canals in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization. { Is Mars habitable? A critical examination of Professor Percival Lowell&apos;s book &quot; Mars and its canals. &quot;, an alternative explanation, by Alfred Russel Wallace, F.R.S., etc.&apos;&apos; London, Macmillan and co., 1907. } This idea led British writer H. G. Wells to write The War of the Worlds in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet’s desiccation. Spectroscopic analysis of Mars&apos; atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer William Wallace Campbell showed that neither water nor oxygen were present in the Martian atmosphere. [ Paul Chambers Life on Mars; The Complete Story London Blandford 1999 0-7137-2747-0 ] By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis. The science fiction genre, although not so named during the time, develops during the late 19th century. Jules Verne &apos;s Around the Moon (1870) features a discussion of the possibility of life on the Moon, but with the conclusion that it is barren.Stories involving extraterrestrials are found in e.g. Garrett P. Serviss &apos;s Edison&apos;s Conquest of Mars (1897). The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells was published in 1898 and stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the &quot; Martian invasion &quot; of Earth prominent in 20th century pop culture. [ 20th century ] [ Space exploration ] { Arecibo message is a digital message sent to } { globular star cluster M13, and is a well-known symbol of human attempts to contact extraterrestrials. } A radio drama version of Wells&apos; novel broadcast in 1938 over the CBS Radio Network led to outrage because it supposedly suggested to many listeners that an actual alien invasion by Martian s was in progress. In the wake of the Roswell Incident, conspiracy theories on the presence of extraterrestrials became a widespread phenomenon in the United States during the 1940s and the beginning Space Age during the 1950s, accompanied by a surge of UFO reports. The term UFO itself was coined in 1952 in the context of the enormous popularity of the concept of &quot; flying saucer s &quot; in the wake of the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting in 1947. The Majestic 12 documents published in 1982 suggest that there was genuine interest in UFO conspiracy theories in the US government during the 1940s. The trend to assume that celestial bodies were populated almost by default was tempered as actual probes visited potential alien abodes in the Solar System beginning in the second half of the 20th century, and by the 1970s belief in UFOs had become part of the fringe beliefs associated with the paranormal, New Age, Earth mysteries, Forteana etc. A number of UFO religion s developed during the surge in UFO belief during th 1950s to 1970s period, and some, such as Scientology (founded 1953) and Raëlism (founded 1974) remain active into the present. The idea of &quot; paleocontact &quot;, supposing that extraterrestrials ( &quot; ancient astronauts &quot; ) have visited the Earth in the remote past and left traces in ancient cultures, appears in early 20th century fiction such as The Call of Cthulhu (1926) and the idea came to be established as a notable aspect of the Ufology subculture in the wake of Erich von Däniken &apos;s Chariots of the Gods? (1968). Alien abduction claims were widespread during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. On the scientific side, the possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was decisively ruled out by the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbour highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains an open question. Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman founded the U.S. Planetary Society, partly as a vehicle for SETI studies in 1980, and since the 1990s, systematic search for radio signals attributable to intelligent extraterrestrial life has been ongoing. In the early 1990s, NASA was set to join in on SETI research with a planned targeted search and all-sky survey. However, Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada cut funding for the project, and no comparable search has taken place since. { Ray Villard, &quot; The Search for Extraterrestrial Civilizations Comes of Age &quot;, “Discovery News” } [ Recent history ] The failure so far of the SETI program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort, has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, the unproven &quot; belief &quot; in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and in popular folklore, notably &quot; Area 51 &quot; and legends. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment with e.g. the ALF TV series (1986–1990), The X-Files (1993–2002), etc. The SETI program is not the result of a continuous, dedicated search, but instead utilizes what resources and manpower it can, when it can. Furthermore, the SETI program only searches a limited range of frequencies at any one time. [ http://www.crichton-official.com/speeches/speeches_quote04.html crichton-official.com Aliens Cause Global Warming Michael Crichton January 17, 2003 ] In the words of SETI&apos;s Frank Drake, &quot; All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters &quot;. { SETI: Search For Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence } Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating habitability criteria on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The Wow! signal, from SETI, remains a speculative debate. In 2000, geologist and paleontologist Peter Ward and astrobiologist Donald Brownlee published a book entitled Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe. { Amazon.com: Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe: Books: Peter Ward, Donald Brownlee } In it, they discussed the Rare Earth hypothesis, in which they claim that Earth -like life is rare in the Universe, while microbial life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets which is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon). The possible existence of primitive (microbial) life outside of Earth is much less controversial to mainstream scientists, although, at present, no direct evidence of such life has been found. Indirect evidence has been offered for the current existence of primitive life on Mars. However, the conclusions that should be drawn from such evidence remain in debate. The Catholic Church has not made a formal ruling on the existence of extraterrestrials. However, writing in the Vatican newspaper, the astronomer, Father José Gabriel Funes, director of the Vatican Observatory near Rome, said in 2008 that intelligent beings created by God could exist in outer space.
