E. Sharpe 0-7656-1579-7 171–172 ] by two former governmental workers, Marcus Raskin (aide to McGeorge Bundy ) and Richard Barnet (aide to John J. McCloy ). As soon as IPS opened its doors in 1963, it plunged into the anti-Vietnam War movement. In 1965, Raskin and Associate Fellow Bernard Fall edited The Vietnam Reader, which became a textbook for teach-ins across the country. In 1967, Raskin and IPS Fellow Arthur Waskow penned &quot; A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority &quot;, { &quot; A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority &quot;. } a document signed by dozens of well-known scholars and religious leaders that helped launch the draft resistance movement. IPS also organized Congressional seminars and published numerous books that challenged the national security state, including Gar Alperovitz ’s Atomic Diplomacy and Barnet’s Intervention and Revolution. IPS was the object of repeated FBI and Internal Revenue Service probes. The Nixon Administration placed Barnet and Raskin on its &quot; enemies list &quot;. { History of IPS, IPS website } [ December 2011 ] In 1964, several leading African-American activists joined the staff and turned IPS into a base of support for the civil rights movement in the nation’s capital. Fellow Bob Moses organized trainings for field organizers of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Council on the links between civil rights theory and practice, while Ivanhoe Donaldson initiated an assembly of African-American government officials. IPS was also at the forefront of the feminist movement. Fellow Charlotte Bunch organized a historic women’s liberation conference in 1966 and later launched two feminist periodicals, Quest and Off Our Backs. Rita Mae Brown wrote and published her path-breaking lesbian coming-of-age novel Rubyfruit Jungle while on the staff in the 1970s. [ 1970s ] In 1976, the Institute&apos;s destiny became irrevocably linked with the international human rights movement when agents of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet murdered two IPS colleagues on Washington’s Embassy Row. { Letelier case } The target of the car bomb attack was Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean official, one of Pinochet’s most outspoken critics and the head of IPS&apos;s sister organization, the Transnational Institute (TNI). Ronni Karpen Moffitt, a 25-year-old IPS development associate, was also killed. [ December 2011 ] The Institute for Policy Studies hosts an annual human rights award in the names of Letelier and Moffitt to honor these fallen colleagues while celebrating new heroes of the human rights movement from the United States and elsewhere in the Americas. The award recipients receive the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award. The Transnational Institute, an international progressive think tank based in Amsterdam, was originally established as the IPS&apos;s international program, although it became independent in 1973. { IPS 30th Anniversary Report } In its attention to the role of multinational corporation s, it was also an early critic of what has come to be called globalization. Richard Barnet&apos;s 1974 examination of the power of multinational corporations, Global Reach was one of the first books on the subject. [ December 2011 ] [ 1980s ] In the 1980s, IPS became heavily involved in supporting the movement against U.S. intervention in Central America. IPS Director Robert Borosage and other staff helped draft Changing Course: Blueprint for Peace in Central America and the Caribbean, which was used by hundreds of schools, labor unions, churches, and citizen organizations as a challenge to U.S. policy in the region. In 1985, Fellow Roger Wilkins helped found the Free South Africa Movement, { FSAM Chronology } which organized a year-long series of demonstrations that led to the imposition of U.S. sanctions. In 1986, after six years of the Reagan administration, Sidney Blumenthal claimed that &quot; Ironically, as IPS has declined in Washington influence, its stature has grown in conservative demonology. In the Reagan era, the institute has loomed as a right-wing obsession and received most of its publicity by serving as a target. &quot; { Sidney Blumenthal, } { Washington Post, 30 July 1986, Left-Wing Thinkers } [ 1990s ] In the early 1990s, IPS began monitoring the environmental impacts of U.S. trade, investment, and drug policies. Since 1994, IPS has also published an annual report on the disparity between CEO and worker pay that has garnered widespread coverage in the mainstream media and helped put the issue of economic inequality at the center of the political debate. { Executive Compensation studies } [ Activities ] At any point in time, the IPS is involved in several projects.

America, Europe, and the Soviet Union: selected essays, Volume 2 By Walter Laqueur. p. 42 The IPS opposed the Iraqi no-fly-zone that was set up to protect Kurds and Shias after the Gulf War. The IPS opposed the NATO war undertaken to stop Slobodan Milošević &apos;s alleged ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo. IPS members played key roles in the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s, in the women&apos;s and environmental movements of the 1970s, and in the peace, anti-apartheid, and anti-intervention movements of the 1980s.
