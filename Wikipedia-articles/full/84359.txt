Tomatina in 2006. La Tomatina ( [ la tomaˈtina va ] ) is a festival that is held in the Valencian town of Buñol, a town located 30  km inland from the Mediterranean Sea in which participants throw tomatoes and get involved in this tomato fight purely for fun. It is held on the last Wednesday of August, during the week of festivities of Buñol. [ History ] [ Origin ] In 1945, during a parade of gigantes y cabezudos, young men who wanted to be in the event staged a brawl in town&apos;s main square, the Plaza del Pueblo. Since there was a vegetable stand nearby, they picked up tomatoes and used them as weapons. The police had to intervene to break up the fight, and forced those responsible to pay the damages incurred. The following year the young people repeated the fight on the same Wednesday of August, only this time they brought their own tomatoes from home. They were again dispersed by the police. After repeating this in subsequent years, the party was established. In 1950, the town allowed the tomato hurl to take place, however the next year it was again stopped. A lot of young people were imprisoned but the Buñol residents forced the authorities to let them go. The festival gained popularity with more and more participants getting involved every year. After subsequent years it was banned again with threats of serious penalties. In the year 1957, some young people planned to celebrate &quot; the tomato&apos;s funeral &quot;, with singers, musicians, and comedies. The main attraction however, was the coffin with a big tomato inside being carried around by youth and a band playing the funeral marches. Considering this popularity of the festival and the alarming demand, 1957 saw the festival becoming official with certain rules and restrictions. These rules have gone through a lot of modifications over the years. Another important landmark in the history of this festival is the year 1975. From this year onwards, &quot; Los Clavarios de San Luis Bertrán &quot; (San Luis Bertrán is the patron of the town of Buñol ) organised the whole festival and brought in tomatoes which had previously been brought by the local people. Soon after this, in 1980, the town hall took the responsibility of organizing and making the festival big. [ Description ] Preparing the &quot; palo jabón &quot;. Throwing tomatoes from a truck. At around 10 AM, festivities begin with the first event of the Tomatina. It is the &quot; palo jamón &quot;, similar to the greasy pole. The goal is to climb a greased pole with a ham on top. As this happens, the crowd work into a frenzy of singing and dancing while being showered in water from hoses. Once someone is able to drop the ham off the pole, the start signal for the tomato fight is given by firing the water shot in the air and trucks make their entry. The signal for the onset is at about 11 when a loud shot rings out, and the chaos begins. { http://living.oneindia.in/cosmopolitan/cosmo-life/2011/la-tomatina-festival-history-160911.html } Several trucks throw tomatoes in abundance in the Plaza del Pueblo. The tomatoes come from Extremadura, where they are less expensive and are grown specifically for the holidays, being of inferior taste. { lasprovincias.es: Bunyol bathing in extremenian tomato. } For the participants the use of goggles and gloves are recommended. The tomatoes must be crushed before being thrown so as to reduce the risk of injury. The estimated number of tomatoes used are around 150,000 i.e. over 40 metric tons. { http://www.donquijote.org/culture/spain/fiestas/tomatina.asp } After exactly one hour, the fight ends with the firing of the second shot, announcing the end. The whole town square is colored red and rivers of tomato juice flow freely. Fire Trucks hose down the streets and participants use hoses that locals provide to remove the tomato paste from their bodies. Some participants go to the pool of “los peñones” to wash. After the cleaning, the village cobblestone streets are pristine due to the acidity of the tomato disinfecting and thoroughly cleaning the surfaces. { http://www.firstfestivaltravel.com/latomatina.htm } [ Rules of the festival ] The city council follows a short list of instructions for the safety of the participants and the festival: The tomatoes have to be squashed before throwing to avoid injuries. No other projectiles except tomatoes are allowed. Participants have to give way to the truck and lorries. The festival doesn&apos;t allow ripping off T-shirts. After the second shot indicative of ending the tomato hurl, no tomatoes should be thrown.
