[ Euhemerus (Εὐήμερος) 4th century B.C. Messene (now Messina ), Sicily 3rd century B.C. Writer, philosopher, mythographer, historian Ancient Greek Plato, Sophists, Cyrenaics Ennius, Diodorus Siculus, Cicero, Varro, Sextus Empiricus, Philo of Byblos, Church Fathers (e.g. Clement of Alexandria, Minucius Felix, Cyprian, Arnobius, Lactantius, Eusebius of Caesarea, Augustine ), Saxo Grammaticus, Snorri Sturluson, Enlightenment ] Euhemerus ( [ Εὐήμερος ] [Euhēmeros], &quot; happy; prosperous &quot; ) (late 4th century BC) was a Greek mythographer at the court of Cassander, the king of Macedon. Euhemerus&apos; birthplace is disputed, with Messina in Sicily as the most probable location, while others champion Chios, or Tegea. [ Life ] Little is known about Euhemerus&apos;s life, and his birthplace is disputed. Classical writers such as Diodorus Siculus, { Diodorus vi.1.1 } Plutarch, { De Iside et Osiride, 23 (360A) } and Polybius, { Hist. 34.5 apud Strabo ii.4.2 } maintained that Euhemerus was a Messenian, but did not specify whether he came from the Peloponnesian or the Sicilian Messene, which was an ancient Greek colony. Other ancient testimonies placed his birth at Chios, Tegea (Pseudo-Plutarch, Plac. Phil.), or Agrigentum (Clement of Alexandria, Protrept.; Arnobius, Adv. Gent.). Most modern scholars however generally agree that Euhemerus came from the Sicilian Messene ( Messina ). { Ne´methy 1889: 4; van Gils 1902: 12; Jacoby 1909; van der Meer 1949: 9. } Diodorus Siculus is one of the very few sources which provides other details about Euhemerus&apos; life. According to Diodorus, { Diodorus vi.1.4. } Euhemerus was a personal friend of Cassander, king of Macedonia (c. 305 – 297 BC) and the most prominent mythographer for the Macedonian court. Sometime in the early 3rd century BC Euhemerus wrote his main work Sacred History ( &quot; Hiera Anagraphê &quot; ). [ Euhemerus&apos; Sacred History ] Only quoted fragments remain from Euhemerus&apos; main work, Sacred History. Diodorus Siculus included fragments from Euhemerus’ writings in the Arabian geography of his fifth book and in the mythology of his sixth book. { Diodorus v.41.4–46, vi.1. } The sixth book of Diodorus’ Bibliotheca is lost, but Eusebius cites a fragment from it at length in his Praeparatio Evangelica. { Eusebius Praep. evan. ii.2.59B-61A. } The ancient Roman writer Ennius first translated Euhemerus&apos; work into Latin, but this translation is also lost. Lactantius however in the 3rd century AD included substantial references to Ennius&apos; translation in the first book of his Divine Institutes. { Lactantius Div. inst. i.11, 13, 14, 17, 22. } Various other fragments of importance also found in the later literature of Augustine of Hippo. { Bibliotheca classica: or, A classical dictionary: containing a copious account of the principal proper names mentioned in ancient authors; with the value of coins, weights, and measures, used among the Greeks and Romans; and a chronological table, Volume 1, John Lemprière, G. &amp; C. &amp; H. Carvill, 1833, p. 547. } From these extant fragments and references, modern scholars have been able to &quot; compile what is presumably a fairly complete picture of Euhemerus’ work &quot;. { Euhemerus in Context, Franco De Angelis De Angelis and Benjamin Garstad, Classical Antiquity, Vol. 25, No. 2, October 2006, p. 212. } Euhemerus&apos; work may have taken the form of a philosophical fictionalized travelogue, universally accepted today as a philosophical Romance, incorporating imagined archaic inscriptions, which his literary persona claimed to have found during his travels. Euhemerus claims to have traveled to a group of islands in the waters off Arabia. One of these, Panchaea, is home to a utopian society made up of a number of different ethnic tribes. His critique of tradition is epitomized in a register of the births and deaths of many of the gods, which his narrator persona discovered inscribed on a golden pillar in a temple of Zeus Triphylius on the invented island of Panchaea; { Plutarch noted that no Greek nor } { barbarian had ever seen such an island. (Fragment noted in Spyridakis 1968:338). } he claimed to have reached the island on a voyage down the Red Sea round the coast of Arabia, undertaken at the request of Cassander of Macedon, according to the Christian historian of the fourth century AD, Eusebius of Caesarea. Euhemerus references a rational island utopia. The ancient Hellenic tradition of a distant Golden Age, of Hesiod &apos;s depiction of human happiness before the gift of Pandora, of the mythic convention of idealized Hyperboreans, made concrete in the legendary figure of the Scythia n philosopher-hero Anacharsis, or the idealized &quot; Meropes &quot; of Theopompus had been recently enriched by contacts with India. { (Brown 1946:262); compare } { Plato &apos;s } { Atlantis or the exotic tropical isle described by } { Iambulus, which was noted in Diodorus 2.55ff. (Spryidakis 1968:338). } Euhemerus apparently systematized a method of interpreting the popular myth s, which was consistent with the attempts of Hellenistic culture to explain traditional religious beliefs in terms of a rational naturalism. Euhemerus asserted that the Greek god s had been originally kings, heroes and conquerors, or benefactors to men, who had thus earned a claim to the veneration of their subjects. Zeus for example, was according to him, a king of Crete, who had been a great conqueror; the tomb of Zeus was shown to visitors near Knossos, perhaps engendering or enhancing among the traditionalists the reputation of Cretans as liars. { Sprydakis 1968:340. } [ Euhemerism ] Euhemerus has become known chiefly for a rationalizing method of interpretation, known as &quot; Euhemerism &quot;, which treats mythological accounts as a reflection of historical events, or mythological characters as historical personages but which were shaped, exaggerated or altered by retelling and traditional mores. In more recent literature of myth, such as in Bulfinch&apos;s Mythology, Euhemerism is called the &quot; Historical Interpretation &quot; of mythology. { Bulfinch, Thomas. Bulfinch&apos;s Mythology. Whitefish: Kessinger, 2004, p. 194. } Euhemerism is defined in modern academic literature as the theory that myths are distorted accounts of real historical events. { Honko, Lauri. &quot; The Problem of Defining Myth &quot;. Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth. Ed. Alan Dundes. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. p. 45. } Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology through history, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writers, including Xenophanes, Herodotus, Hecataeus of Abdera and Ephorus. { S. Spyridakis &quot; Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete &quot; The Classical Journal 63.8 (May 1968, pp. 337-340) p.338. } { Herodotus presented rationalized accounts of the myth of } { Io (Histories I.1ff) and events of the Trojan War (Histories 2.18ff). } However Euhemerus is credited as having developed the theory in application to all myths, considering mythology to be &quot; history in disguise &quot;. { An introduction to mythology, } { Lewis Spence, 1921, p. 42. } In a scene described in Plato&apos;s Phaedrus, Socrates offers a euhemeristic interpretation of a myth concerning Boreas and Orithyia : [ Phaedrus ] { : Tell me, Socrates, isn&apos;t it from somewhere near this stretch of the Ilisus that people say Boreas carried Orithuia away? } [ Socrates ] { : So they say. } [ Phaedrus ] { : Couldn&apos;t this be the very spot? The stream is lovely, pure and clear: just right for girls to be playing nearby. } [ Socrates ] { : No, it is two or three hundred yards farther downstream, where one crosses to get to the district of Arga. I think there is even an altar to Boreas there. } [ Phaedrus ] { : I hadn&apos;t noticed it. But tell me, Socrates, in the name of Zeus, do you really believe that legend is true? } [ Socrates ] { : Actually, it would not be out of place for me to reject it, as our intellectuals do. I could then tell a clever story: I could claim that a gust of the North Wind blew her over the rocks where she was playing with Pharmaceia; and once she was killed that way people said she had been carried off by Boreas... &quot; } [ Plato Plato Cooper John Madison Hutchinson D.S. Complete works http://books.google.com/books?id%3DeSKTvJDrr5kC 2011-09-20 1997 Hackett Publishing 978-0-87220-349-5 509–510 1808 ] Thus in Socrates&apos; euhemeristic approach of the myth of Boreas abducting Orithyia, he rationalizes the story of Boreas, the northern wind, as having pushed Orithyia off the rock cliffs through the equation of Boreas with a natural gush of wind and the acceptance of Orithyia as a historical personage. However Socrates, despite holding some euhemeristic views, mocked the concept that all myths could be rationalized, noting that the mythical creatures of &quot; absurd forms &quot; such as Centaurs and the Chimera could not easily be explained. { Phaedrus, 22d } In the ancient skeptic philosophical tradition of Theodorus of Cyrene and the Cyrenaics, Euhemerus forged a new method of interpretation for the contemporary religious beliefs. Though his work is lost, the reputation of Euhemerus was that he believed that much of Greek mythology could be interpreted as natural or historical events subsequently given supernatural characteristics through distortion or retelling. Subsequently Euhemerus was considered to be an atheist by his opponents, most notably Callimachus. { S. Spyridakis, 1968, pp.338-339. } [ Deification ] Euhemerus&apos; views were rooted in the deification of men, usually kings, into Gods through apotheosis. In numerous ancient cultures, kings were exalted or venerated into the status of divine beings and worshipped after their death, or sometimes even while they ruled. Dion, the tyrant ruler of Syracuse in Sicily was deified while he was alive and modern scholars consider his apotheosis to have influenced Euhemerus&apos; views on the origin of all Gods. { Euhemerus in Context, Franco De Angelis De Angelis and Benjamin Garstad, Classical Antiquity,Vol. 25, No. 2, October 2006, pp. 211-242. } Euhemerus was also living during the contemporaneous deification of the Seleucids and &quot; pharaoization &quot; of the Ptolemies in a fusion of Hellenic and native Egyptian traditions. [ Tomb of Zeus ] Euhemerus argued that Zeus was a mortal king who died on Crete, and that his tomb could still be found there with the inscription bearing his name. { Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete, S. Spyridakis, The Classical Journal, Vol. 63, No. 8, May, 1968, pp. 337-340. } This claim however did not originate with Euhemerus, as the general sentiment of Crete during the time of Epimenides of Knossos (c. 600 BC) was that Zeus was buried somewhere in Crete. For this reason, the Cretans were often considered atheists, and Epimenides called them all liars (see Epimenides paradox ). Callimachus, an opponent of Euhemerus&apos; views on mythology argued that Zeus&apos; Cretan tomb was fabricated, and that he was eternal: [ Cretans always lie.For the Cretans even built a tomb, Lord, for you. But you did not die, for you are eternal. Callimachus, Hymn to Zeus ] A later Latin scholia on the Hymns of Callimachus, attempted to account for the tomb of Zeus. According to the scholia, the original tomb inscription read: &quot; the tomb Minos, the son of Jupiter &quot; but overtime the words &quot; Minos, the son &quot; wore away only leaving &quot; the tomb of Jupiter &quot;, which had misled the Cretans into thinking that Zeus had died and was buried there. { The hymns of Callimachus, tr. into Engl. verse, with notes. To which are added, Select epigrams, and the Coma Berenices of the same author, six hymns of Orpheus, and the Encomium of Ptolemy by Theocritus, by W. Dodd, 1755, p. 3, footnote. } Influenced by Euhemerus, Porphyry in the 3rd century AD claimed that Pythagoras had discovered the tomb of Zeus on Crete and written on the tomb&apos;s surface an inscription reading &quot; Here died and was buried Zan, whom they call Zeus &quot;. { Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religions and Themis a Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion, Jane Ellen Harrison, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 57. } Varro also wrote about the tomb of Zeus, but few accounts could agree of its precise location on Crete. [ Euhemerism and Christians ] Hostile to paganism, the early Christians, such as the Church Fathers embraced euhemerism in attempt to undermine the validity of pagan Gods. { Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, p. 397. } The usefulness of euhemerist views to early Christian apologists may be summed up in Clement of Alexandria &apos;s triumphant cry in Cohortatio ad gentes: &quot; Those to whom you bow were once men like yourselves. &quot; { Quoted in Seznec 1995:12, who observes (p. 13) of the numerous Christian examples he mentions, &quot; Thus Euhemerism Euhemerism became a favorite weapon of the Christian polemicists, a weapon they made use of at every turn. &quot;. } [ The Book of Wisdom ] The Book of Wisdom, a deuterocanonical book, has a passage, [ Wisdom 14:12-21 ], giving a euhemerist explanation of the origin of idols. [ Wisdom of Solomon ] [ Early Christian apologists ] The early Christian apologists deployed the euhemerist argument to support their position that pagan mythology was merely an aggregate of fable s of human invention. Cyprian, a North African convert to Christianity, wrote a short essay, De idolorum vanitate (On the Vanity of Idols) in 247 AD that assumes the euhemeristic rationale as though it needed no demonstration. Cyprian begins: [ That those are no gods whom the common people worship, is known from this: they were formerly kings, who on account of their royal memory subsequently began to be adored by their people even in death. Thence temples were founded to them; thence images were sculptured to retain the countenances of the deceased by the likeness; and men sacrificed victims, and celebrated festal days, by way of giving them honour. Thence to posterity those rites became sacred, which at first had been adopted as a consolation. ] Cyprian proceeds directly to examples, the apotheosis of Melicertes and Leucotheia; &quot; The Castors [i.e. Dioscuri ] die by turns, that they may live, &quot; a reference to the daily sharing back and forth of their immortality by the Heavenly Twins. &quot; The cave of Jupiter is to be seen in Crete, and his sepulchre is shown, &quot; Cyprian says, confounding Zeus and Dionysus but showing that the Minoan cave cult was still alive in Crete in the third century AD. In his exposition, it is to Cyprian&apos;s argument to marginalize the syncretism of pagan belief, in order to emphasize the individual variety of local deities: [ From this the religion of the gods is variously changed among individual nations and provinces, inasmuch as no one god is worshipped by all, but by each one the worship of its own ancestors is kept peculiar. ] Eusebius in his Chronicle employed euhemerism to argue the Babylonian God Baal was a deified ruler and that the God Belus, was the first Assyrian king. { Chronicon, Pat. Graeca XIX, cols. 132, 133, i. 3. } Euhemeristic views are found expressed also in Tertullian, De idololatria the Octavius of Minucius Felix and in Origen. { Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: &quot; Contra Celsum &quot; III 22-43, Harry Y. Gamble, Vigiliae Christianae, Vol. 33, No. 1, Mar., 1979, pp. 12-29. } Arnobius &apos; dismissal of paganism in the fifth century, on rationalizing grounds, may have depended on a reading of Cyprian, with the details enormously expanded. Isidore of Seville, compiler of the most influential early medieval encyclopedia, devoted a chapter &quot; De diis gentium &quot; { Isidore, } { Etymologiae, book viii, ch. 12. } to elucidating with numerous examples and elaborated genealogies of gods, the principle drawn from Lactantius, &quot; Quos pagani deos asserunt, homines olim fuisse produntur. &quot; ( &quot; Those whom pagans claim to be gods were once mere men. &quot; ) Elaborating logically, he attempted to place these deified men in the six great periods of history as he divided it, and created mythological dynasties. Isidore&apos;s euhemeristic bent was codified in a rigid parallel with sacred history in Peter Comestor &apos;s appendix to his much translated Historia scholastica (written ca. 1160), further condensing Isidore to provide strict parallels of figures from the pagan legend, as it was now viewed in historicised narrative, and the mighty human spirits of the patriarchs of the Old Testament. { Seznec 1995:16. } Martin of Braga in his De correctione rusticorum wrote idolatry stemmed from post-deluge survivors of Noah&apos;s family who began to worship the Sun and Stars instead of God. In his view the Greek Gods were deified descendants of Noah who were once real historical personages. { http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/pagan4.htm#N_64_ } [ Middle Ages ] Christian writers during the Middle Ages continued to embrace Euhemerism, such as Vincent of Beauvais, Petrus Comestor, Roger Bacon and Godfrey of Viterbo. { Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, pp. 396-410. } { The } { Franciscan friar } { Roger Bacon in the 13th century argued that ancient Gods such as } { Minerva, } { Prometheus, } { Atlas, } { Apollo, } { Io and } { were all deified humans. -Opus Maius, ed. J. H. Bridges, Oxford, 1897, pp.46-47. } [ Snorri Sturluson&apos;s &quot; euhemerism &quot; ] In the Prose Edda, composed around 1220, the Christian Icelandic bard and historian Snorri Sturluson proposes that the Norse gods were originally historical war leaders and kings. Odin, the father of the gods, is introduced as a historical character living in present-day Turkey, tracing his ancestry back to Priam, the king of Troy during the Trojan War. As Odin travels north to settle in the Nordic countries, he establishes the royal families ruling in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway at the time. [ And whatever countries they passed through, great glory was spoken of them, so that they seemed more like gods than men. Snorri Sturluson, trans. Anthony Faulkes, Edda. Everyman. 1987. (Prologue, p. 4) ] Thus, while Snorri&apos;s euhemerism follows the early Christian tradition, the effect is not simply to discredit the divinity of the gods of a religion on the wane, but also (on the model of Virgil &apos;s Aeneid ) to hint that the &apos;divinisation&apos; was done in order to legitimize more recent Scandinavian rulers. [ Euhemerism in the modern world ] Euhemeristic interpretations of mythology continued throughout the Early modern period from the 16th century, { For example in the preface to } { Arthur Golding &apos;s 1567 translation of } { Ovid &apos;s } { Metamorphoses into English, Golding offers a rationale for contemporary Christian readers to interpret Ovid&apos;s pagan stories. He argues: &apos;The true and everliving God the } { Paynim s did not know: Which caused them the name of Gods on creatures to bestow&apos;. } to modern times. In 1711, the French historian Antoine Banier in his Mythologie et la fable expliqués par l&apos;histoire ( &quot; The mythology and fables of the ancients, explained &quot; ) presented strong arguments for a euhemerist interpretation of Greek mythology. { The rise of modern mythology, 1680-1860, Burton Feldman, Robert D. Richardson&apos;&apos;, Indiana University Press, 2000, p.86. } Jacob Bryant &apos;s A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology (1744) was also another key work on Euhemerism of the period, but argued so from a Biblical basis. Of the early 19th century, George Stanley Faber was another leading Biblical euhemerist. His work The Origin of Pagan Idolatry (1816) proposed that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were all deified men. Outside of Biblical influenced literature, some archaeologists embraced euhemerist views since they discovered legends or myths could verify archaeological findings. Heinrich Schliemann was a prominent archaeologist of the 19th century who argued myths had embedded historical truths. Schliemann was an advocate of the historical reality of places and characters mentioned in the works of Homer and claimed to have discovered artefacts of Greek mythological figures (see Mask of Agamemnon ). Herbert Spencer embraced some euhemeristic arguments in attempt to explain the anthropocentric origin of religion, through ancestor worship. Rationalizing methods of interpretation that treat some myths as traditional accounts based upon actual historical events are a continuous feature of some modern readings of mythology. The twentieth century poet and mythographer Robert Graves offered many such &quot; euhemerist &quot; interpretations in his telling of The White Goddess (1948) and The Greek Myths (1955). His suggestions that such myths record and justify the political and religious overthrow of earlier cult systems have been received with at least some skepticism.
