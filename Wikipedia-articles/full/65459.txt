He is currently principal owner, president and CEO of the Texas Rangers. During a major league record 27-year baseball career, he pitched in 1966 and from 1968 to 1993 for four different teams: the New York Mets, California Angels, Houston Astros, and Texas Rangers. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999. { Pitching Splits and Daily Pitching Logs at Retrosheet and Baseball-Reference.com. } Ryan, a hard-throwing right-handed pitcher, threw pitches that were regularly recorded above 100 miles per hour (160.93  km/h). The high velocity remained throughout his career, even into his 40s. Ryan was also known to throw a devastating 12–6 curveball at exceptional velocity for a breaking ball. [ The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers 2004 Fireside New York 0-7432-6158-5 382-383 Bill James Rob Neyer ] While his lifetime winning percentage was a relatively pedestrian.526, Ryan was an eight-time MLB All-Star, and his 5,714 career strikeouts rank first in baseball history by a significant margin. He leads the runner-up, Randy Johnson, by 839 strikeouts. Similarly, Ryan&apos;s 2,795 bases on balls lead second-place Steve Carlton by 962—walking over 50% more hitters than any other pitcher in Major League history. Other than Jackie Robinson (whose number was retired by the entire MLB), Ryan is currently the only major league baseball player to have his number retired by at least 3 different teams: the Angels, Astros, and Rangers. Ryan is the all-time leader in no-hitter s with seven, three more than any other pitcher. He is tied with Bob Feller for most one-hitters, with 12. Ryan also pitched 18 two-hitters. Despite the seven no-hitters, he never threw a perfect game, nor did he ever win a Cy Young Award. Ryan is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League baseball games in four decades. [ Early life ] Ryan was born in Refugio, Texas, the youngest of six children, [ Throwing Heat: The Autobiography of Nolan Ryan Ryan Nolan Harvey Frommer 1988 Doubleday New York 0-385-24438-X ] to Lynn Nolan Ryan, Sr. and Martha Lee Hancock Ryan. His family lived in nearby Woodsboro, Texas until they moved to Alvin, Texas when he was 6 weeks old. As a young boy, he enjoyed throwing objects at any target. His father thought that baseball was a better usage for his arm, therefore he encouraged Nolan to play the game. Ryan joined Alvin Little League Baseball when he was nine, and pitched the first no-hitter of his life a few years later. Ryan also played various positions besides pitcher. [ Sanna Ellyn Nolan Ryan 2003 The Rosen Publishing Group 0-8239-3601-5 ] Ryan played baseball for Coach Jim Watson at Alvin High School for all of his high school career. { http://www.nolanryanfoundation.org/museum.htm } { http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Nolan_Ryan.aspx } Ryan held the senior year strikeout record for 44 years, retiring 21 hitters in a game { http://insidecorner.dmagazine.com/2009/04/08/reporters-notebook-rangers-replace-metcalf-with-german/ }. The record was tied by Alvin High School pitchers Aaron Stewart { http://www.uhcougars.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/stewart_aaron00 } and Josh Land in the same week in 2009 { http://www.alvinbaseball.org/teams/varsity/nolan-ryan-strikeout-record-broken/ } [ Playing career ] [ New York Mets (1966–1971) ] In 1965, after graduating from Alvin High School, Ryan was drafted by the New York Mets in the 12th round of the 1965 Major League Baseball Draft. He was assigned to a minor league team in the Appalachian League called the Marion Mets in Marion, Virginia. { Minor League Career Statistics at Baseball-Reference.com } When Ryan was called up to the New York club the following year, he was the second-youngest player in the league. His first strikeout victim was Pat Jarvis, and he gave up his first major league home run to Joe Torre, a future big-league manager. Ryan missed much of the 1967 season due to illness, an arm injury, and service with the Army Reserve, pitching only 7 innings for the Mets&apos; minor league affiliate in Jacksonville. Ryan did not stick in the majors for good until the [ 1968 ] season. Despite his fastball, he was unable to crack the Mets outstanding pitching rotation, led by Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman. Ryan was used more as a reliever and spot starter by the 1969 Mets. To deal with frequent blisters on his throwing hand he often soaked his fingers in pickle brine, [ http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name%3DNolan_Ryan_1947 The Ballplayers - Nolan Ryan BaseballLibrary.com 2011-03-12 ] although the technique&apos;s effectiveness was questioned both by Ryan&apos;s teammates and coaches. Ryan pitched well in the 1969 postseason for the Mets. Against the Braves in the NLCS, Ryan completed a Mets sweep by throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3, getting his first playoff win (it would take him 12 years to get another). Then in the 1969 World Series, Ryan saved Game 3, pitching 2⅓ shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles. The Game 3 victory gave the Mets a 2–1 lead in the Series, which they went on to win in five games. It would be Ryan&apos;s only World Series appearance in his career. On April 18, 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Four days later, Ryan&apos;s teammate, Tom Seaver, topped it with 19 against the San Diego Padres. [ What a Day For Tom Seaver Associated Press http://news.google.com/newspapers?id%3DEC9IAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3DawANAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3D800%2C6410735 Meriden Journal 23 April 1970 18 April 2011 ] Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower to a pitcher. However, by 1971 Ryan had become increasingly frustrated and was considering retiring from baseball. His record for the season was 10–14. He told Mets management that he was not happy in New York and requested a trade. [ California Angels (1972 &amp; amp;ndash;1979) ] [ AngelsRetired30.png Nolan Ryan 30 California Angels 1992 ] On December 10, 1971, Ryan was traded to the California Angels along with pitcher Don Rose, catcher Francisco Estrada and outfielder Leroy Stanton for shortstop Jim Fregosi (who would later manage Ryan in Anaheim). Fregosi had been an All-Star in six of seven seasons between 1964 and 1970, and was only 29 years old. But Fregosi who is rated by Bill James as the 15th best shortstop in MLB history, played fewer than 150 games for the Mets, and never had a good season again. The deal remains controversial, and has been cited as one of the worst in Mets history. It has been argued that in light of his ineffectiveness and unhappiness as a Met, had Ryan not been sent to another organization, he would have continued to struggle with his control. The move was not viewed as unreasonable at the time. However, the transaction quickly turned sour for New York. In his first season with the Angels, Ryan, given a chance to pitch regularly as a starter for the first time in his career, had a league-leading 329 strikeouts—nearly a third more than the AL runner-up, and to that point, the fourth-highest total of the 20th century. Within five seasons, the season would only be Ryan&apos;s fourth-highest strikeout total. He also set a still-standing Major League record by allowing only 5.26 hits per nine innings, breaking Luis Tiant &apos;s 5.30 in 1968, as well as posting a 2.28 earned run average that year, to date the second lowest in franchise history, trailing only Dean Chance &apos;s 1.65 in 1964. Though Ryan&apos;s actual winning percentage hovered only slightly over.500, his strikeouts and no-hitters brought him media attention. Meanwhile, Fregosi failed to produce as a Met, making no significant contribution to the Mets&apos; 1973 pennant-winning campaign; he was sold to the Texas Rangers mid-season. Although the Angels were a sub-.500 team and remained one for much of his time there, Ryan managed to post some winning records, notably 19 –16 in [ 1972 ], 21 –16 in [ 1973 ] and 22 –16 in [ 1974 ] (the 22 wins tied what remains the Angels franchise record, set by Clyde Wright in [ 1970 ] ). Ryan also led the league in losses in 1976 with a 17 –18 record (one short of the franchise record for losses). In the early 1970s, many teams used a four-man rotation and expected the starter to complete the game; thus most games Ryan started ended in a decision. On July 9, 1972, Ryan struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 3 –0 win over the Boston Red Sox; he became the seventh American League pitcher to accomplish the nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning, and the first (and currently only) pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat in both leagues. (On April 19, 1968, he had struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of a 2 –1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals; becoming the eighth National League pitcher and the 14th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat.) In 1973, Ryan set his first major record when he struck out 383 batters in one season, beating Sandy Koufax &apos;s old mark by one. Remarking on this feat, Koufax joked, &quot; Yeah, and he also surpassed my total for bases on balls in a single season by 91. I suspect half of those guys he struck out swung rather than get hit. &quot; Ryan threw two no-hitter s in 1973. In the second one, on July 15 against the Detroit Tigers, he struck out 17 batters - most in a recorded no-hitter. Ryan was so dominant in this game, it led to one of baseball&apos;s best-remembered pranks. Tigers first baseman Norm Cash came to the plate with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, having already struck out three times, and was carrying a clubhouse table leg instead of a bat. Plate umpire Ron Luciano ordered Cash to go back and get a regulation bat, to which Cash replied, &quot; Why, I won&apos;t hit him anyway! &quot; [ http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_9_60/ai_76928886/ &quot; Tiger first baseman Norm Cash. &quot; &apos; &amp; #39;Baseball Digest&apos; &amp; #39;, 2001 Findarticles.com 1973-07-15 2011-03-12 ] With a regulation bat in hand, Cash did finally make contact, but popped out to end the game. Ryan added a third no-hitter in 1974 and a fourth in 1975, tying another of Koufax&apos;s records. In 1974 he twice struck out 19 batters, tying Tom Seaver and Steve Carlton for the single-game record for a nine-inning game. Roger Clemens would become the first pitcher with a 20-strikeout game in 1986. The California Angels finally made the playoffs in Ryan&apos;s eighth and final year there in 1979. He started Game 1 of the ALCS and threw seven innings against the Orioles&apos; Jim Palmer, but neither man was involved in the decision as Baltimore won in the 10th inning. Ryan was scheduled to pitch Game 5, but the Angels were eliminated in four. The season complete, Ryan became a free agent. Ryan led the American League in strikeouts seven times during his eight seasons with the Angels. However, he also led the league in walks in six of those years, and finished second the other two seasons: 1975 and 1979. Aside from Bob Feller in 1938, Ryan is the only man since 1900 to walk 200 batters in a season, which he did twice: in 1974 and 1977. Though Ryan&apos;s strikeouts and no-hitters got him considerable media attention, he did not win over Angels general manager Buzzie Bavasi, who dismissed him as a flashy.500 pitcher (Ryan was 26 –27 in the two years both were with the Angels). When Bavasi let Ryan leave after a 16 –14 record in the 1979 season, Bavasi remarked he only needed to replace Ryan with two 8 –7 pitchers, adding, &quot; I think my plumber could do that. &quot; [ October 2010 ] [ Houston Astros (1980 &amp; amp;ndash;1988) ] [ AstrosRet 34.PNG Nolan Ryan 34 Houston Astros 1996 ] Ryan signed a lucrative free-agent contract with the Houston Astros after the 1979 season. The normally light-hitting Ryan got his Houston years started with a bang in a nationally televised game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 12, 1980, when he hit a three-run home run off Don Sutton. It was the first of two homers in Ryan&apos;s career and produced half of the six RBI he would get that year. On July 4 of that season, at Riverfront Stadium, Ryan recorded his 3,000th career strikeout, the victim being César Gerónimo of the Cincinnati Reds (Gerónimo had also been Bob Gibson &apos;s 3,000th strikeout victim, in 1974). Ryan got his third taste of postseason play in 1980, but the Astros were stopped one game short of the World Series. In the 1980 NLCS versus the Philadelphia Phillies, Ryan pitched well in Game 2, leaving the game tied 2 –2 in the seventh (having contributed to both Astros runs with a run scored following a walk, and a sacrifice bunt leading to a run) but again got a no decision in a game that went extra innings. In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan and the Astros held a 5 –2 lead entering the 8th inning. But Ryan allowed three consecutive singles before walking in the third run. The Houston bullpen allowed the Phillies to take a 7 –5 lead, and only a game-tying Astro rally permitted Ryan to escape the loss. { Atlanta Braves at } { Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in 1983 } On September 26, 1981, Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter, breaking Koufax&apos;s mark while becoming the third pitcher to throw a no-hitter in each league. That season, his 1.69 ERA won the National League ERA title. Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1981 NLDS, Ryan threw a complete game 2-hitter in the opener, outlasting the Dodgers&apos; rookie sensation Fernando Valenzuela. It was Ryan&apos;s second and last career postseason win. In the fifth and final game of the series, Ryan left trailing 3 –0 and took the loss. By the end of the 1982 season, both Ryan and Steve Carlton were approaching Walter Johnson &apos;s all-time strikeout record, sometimes passing one another&apos;s career totals in successive starts. On April 27, 1983, Ryan won the race with his 3,509th whiff, against Brad Mills of the Montreal Expos ( Steve Carlton would reach the same mark two weeks after Ryan). In 1986, Ryan&apos;s Astros faced the New York Mets in the National League Championship Series. Ryan had a shaky start in Game 2, taking the loss. He returned in Game 5, throwing 9 innings of 2-hit, 1-run, 12-strikeout ball. However, one of those hits was a Darryl Strawberry home run which tied the game at 1 –1, as Dwight Gooden matched Ryan pitch for pitch. Ryan got a no-decision as his Astros lost in 12 innings. In 1987, Ryan led the major leagues in both ERA (2.76) and strikeouts (270) at the age of 40—but finished 8–16 as the result of extremely poor run support. Despite his.333 winning percentage, Ryan tied for 5th place in the 1987 Cy Young voting. [ Texas Rangers (1989 &amp; amp;ndash;1993) ] [ RangersRet 34.PNG Nolan Ryan 34 Texas Rangers (baseball) 1996 ] Ryan left Houston in a contract dispute following the 1988 season and joined the Texas Rangers. He became the first player to play for all four MLB original expansion teams: the Mets, Angels, Houston Colt.45s/ Astros and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers. (Ryan would be joined in this category by Darren Oliver, who made his Major League debut as Ryan&apos;s teammate in September 1993. Oliver&apos;s father Bob had also been a teammate of Ryan&apos;s, with the Angels from 1972 to 1974.) In 1989, he went 16–10 and led the league with 301 strikeouts. Against the Oakland Athletics on August 22, Ryan struck out Rickey Henderson to become the only pitcher to record 5,000 career strikeouts. (Following the game, Henderson was quoted as saying, &quot; If he ain&apos;t struck you out, then you ain&apos;t nobody. &quot; ) Two years later, at 44, Ryan finished fifth in the league in ERA (2.91) and third in strikeouts (203). In 1990, Ryan threw his sixth no-hitter on June 11 against the Athletics, and earned his 300th win on July 31 against the Milwaukee Brewers. [ http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/02/sports/ryan-savors-his-milestone-with-a-feeling-of-relief.html The New York Times Malcolm Moran Ryan Savors His Milestone With a Feeling of Relief August 2, 1990 ] On May 1, 1991, set a record by throwing the seventh no-hitter of his career, striking out Roberto Alomar of the Toronto Blue Jays for the final out. On August 6, 1992, Ryan had the first and only ejection of his career when he was ejected after engaging in a shouting match with Oakland Athletics outfielder Willie Wilson with 2 outs in the 9th inning. Before the 1993 season, Ryan announced his retirement, effective at the end of that season. On August 4, just before the end, Ryan had yet another high profile moment – this time an on-the-mound fight. After Ryan hit Robin Ventura of the Chicago White Sox, Ventura charged the mound in order to fight Ryan, who was 20 years his senior. Ryan secured the 26-year-old Ventura in a headlock with his left arm, while pummeling Ventura&apos;s head with his right fist six times before catcher Iván Rodríguez was able to pull Ventura away from Ryan. Ryan stated afterwards it was the same maneuver he used on steers he had to brand on his Texas ranch. Videos of the incident were played that evening throughout the country. While Ventura was ejected, Ryan–who had barely moved from his spot on the mound in the fracas–was allowed to remain in the game. White Sox manager Gene Lamont vehemently argued this, leading to his own ejection. Ryan pitched hitless ball the rest of the way. He had determined to be more aggressive after coming out on the wrong side of an altercation with Dave Winfield in 1980. [ Freeman Denne H Raging Ryan strikes Ventura. Austin American-Statesman August 5, 1993 C1 ] { Arlington Stadium } Ryan&apos;s very durable arm finally gave out in Seattle on September 22, 1993, when he tore a ligament, ending his career two starts earlier than planned. Briefly attempting to pitch past the injury, Ryan threw one further pitch after tearing his ligament; with his injured arm, his final pitch was measured at 98 miles per hour. Ryan&apos;s last start was his career worst; he allowed a single, four walks, and a grand slam in the top of the first without recording an out. It was his record setting 10th grand slam given up of his career. (Ryan left trailing 5 –0, and the fourth walk was completed by a reliever after Ryan&apos;s injury, but credited to Ryan.) On September 17, 1993, Greg Myers of the California Angels became the last strikeout victim of Nolan Ryan’s career. { Baseball’s Top 100: The Game’s Greatest Records, p.32, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, ISBN 978-1-55365-507-7 } Ryan finished his career having played in a major league record 27 seasons. He was the final active player from the 1960s to retire from Major League Baseball, outlasting Carlton Fisk (the final active position player) by three months. [ No-hitters ] Ryan threw a record seven no-hitters during his Major League career, three more than any other pitcher. The no-hitters spanned three decades of pitching.

Both teams were affiliates of the Houston Astros, for whom Ryan also served as a special assistant to the general manager until he became the president of the Texas Rangers in 2008. The Express became the Rangers&apos; AAA affiliate beginning in 2011; the Hooks are still the Astros&apos; AA affiliate. Ryan playing catch with some dogs at his Alvin ranch Ryan threw out the ceremonial &quot; first pitch &quot; before Game 3 of the 2005 World Series between the Astros and the White Sox, the first World Series game ever played in Texas. That game went 14 innings, equaling the longest in innings in World Series history (at 5:41, it was the longest in time). ESPN wryly suggested the Astros might have needed to pull the 58-year-old Ryan out of retirement if the game had gone much longer. Ryan has co-written six books: autobiographies Miracle Man (with Jerry Jenkins, 1992), Throwing Heat (with Harvey Frommer, 1988) and The Road to Cooperstown (with Mickey Herskowitz and T.R. Sullivan, 1999); Kings of the Hill (with Mickey Herskowitz, 1992), about contemporary pitchers; and instructional books Pitching and Hitting (with Joe Torre and Joel Cohen, 1977), and Nolan Ryan&apos;s Pitcher&apos;s Bible (with Tom House, 1991).

He served on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission from 1995 to 2001. He appeared as a TV spokesman for Advil for several years, promoting the pain medication he recommended for his own arm. He also has appeared in various television commercials shown in the Texas market. During election years in the late 90s, Ryan&apos;s name would frequently come up in the news as a potential candidate for some statewide office. Although Ryan is an ardent Republican, he has never run in any race, and these rumors have quieted. He appeared in print ads for the National Rifle Association&apos;s &quot; I&apos;m the NRA &quot; campaign. While not running for office himself, in 1996 Ryan campaigned on behalf of Ron Paul in the Texas&apos;s 14th congressional district election.

Greenberg sold his stake in the Rangers in 2011, and Ryan is now the team&apos;s principal owner. [ October 2011 ] [ Legacy ] Nolan Ryan&apos;s HOF plaque Nolan Ryan is often compared to the Dodgers&apos; Sandy Koufax : they are linked by the fact that Ryan broke two of Koufax&apos;s records, for most no-hitters and the single-season strikeout mark. There are further similarities: both Ryan and Koufax started in the majors at a very young age and struggled early in their careers, and both were very reserved and private. Both had tenacious contract disputes with their owners. Ryan readily admitted the money was a large part of the reason he played as long as he did. But there are key differences, too: Koufax pitched left-handed and Ryan right-handed; despite his early troubles, Koufax played his entire career with one team, whereas Ryan played for four. Koufax played on four championship Dodgers teams, whereas Ryan found himself on mostly mediocre teams. Ryan had an unremarkable win-loss percentage; Koufax had a stellar one, especially in his final four years. Ryan had a won-loss record only slightly better than the teams for which he played; Koufax had a significantly better percentage than his Dodger teams. Ryan, however, had one of the longest careers of any player, whereas Koufax&apos;s sterling career was cut short in its prime by arthritis and arm trouble. Nonetheless, both stand out as the best-known &quot; power pitcher s &quot; of their times. Comparisons to Bob Feller are probably more to the point: like Ryan, Feller was a burly, durable power pitcher, who was likely to strike out or walk any given batter, and pitched large numbers of low-hit games. Feller, however, was able to correct his wildness over time (the two are the only post-1900 pitchers to walk over 200 batters in a season) whereas Ryan had limited late success in that area. Feller, however, had a considerably better won/loss percentage than the Indian teams for whom he pitched. Feller has stated that Ryan&apos;s former Mets teammate, Tom Seaver, was a much better pitcher than Ryan, whom he says was just a thrower who had a hard time getting the ball over the plate. [ December 2009 ] Ryan played in more seasons (27) than any other player in modern major league history. Ryan ranks first all-time in strikeouts (5,714), fewest hits allowed per nine innings (6.56), and no-hitters (7). He is also fifth in innings pitched (5,386), second in games started (773), seventh in shutouts (61) and is tied for 14th in wins (324). Opposing hitters hit only.204 against Ryan during his career, though they had a.309 on base percentage against him. He also limited hitters to a.298 slugging percentage. Ryan had 15 or more strikeouts in a game 26 times, second only to Randy Johnson, who had 28. His lengthy career spanned generations, as he struck out seven pairs of fathers and sons during his career.
