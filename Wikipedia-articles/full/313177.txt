During his life, he has held the title of the King twice: first between 1950 and 1951 as a child when his grandfather Tribhuvan was forced into exile in India with the rest of his family; and from 2001 to 2008, following the Nepalese royal massacre. King Gyanendra&apos;s second reign ended in 2008, when the monarchy was abolished by the Nepalese Constituent Assembly and the interim Federal Republic of Nepal formed in its place. King Gyanendra became a private citizen and was stripped of his duties. Unable to hold the election on time, the then Prime Minister of Nepal Sher Bahadur Deuba, repeatedly asked for continuances with the King. Citing the failure of the Prime Minister to hold the election, King Gyanendra sacked the cabinet and assumed power and formed a new government. In February 2005, King Gyanendra took complete control of the government, dismissing the elected parliament (Parliament was dismissed in 2002 when King Gyanendra sacked the government of PM Sher Bahadur Deuba). He gave assurances that the country would return to normalcy and prosperity in three years. [ December 2010 ]. Following opposition to his direct rule he was forced to return power to the parliament in April 2006, which in turn reduced the King&apos;s status to that of a ceremonial monarch. He continued as such until 28 May 2008 when the Constituent Assembly controlled by the Maoists decided to depose him and declared Nepal an interim republic until a republican constitution was promulgated. The constitution drafting deadline expired on May 28, 2012 with no new constitution in place. There have been some calls from parties loyal to the monarchy for a referendum to decide on the need for a monarchy after the constitutional crisis brought about the resignation of the Maoist-led government.

After his birth, his father was told by a court astrologer not to look at his newborn son because it would bring him bad luck, so Gyanendra was sent to live with his grandmother.

He was brought back to the capital Kathmandu by the Prime Minister Mohan Shamsher, who had him declared King on 7 November 1950. Gyanendra was not only crowned but coins were issued in his name. The Rana Prime Minister provided a three hundred thousand rupee annual budget as expenditure for the King. After opposition to the hereditary rule of the Rana Prime Ministers from India, a deal was reached in January 1951, and his grandfather King Tribhuvan returned to Nepal and resumed the throne.

A two-man investigation team appointed by Gyanendra, and made up of Keshav Prasad Upadhaya, then Supreme Court Chief Justice, and Taranath Ranabhat, then speaker of the House of Representatives, carried out a week-long investigation. { Nepal massacre inquiry begins, at long last } [ February 2011 ] After interviewing more than 100 people—including eyewitnesses, palace officials, guards, and staff, they concluded that, indeed, Crown Prince Dipendra had carried out the massacre, but did not draw any further conclusions.

In May 2002, he supported the popularly-elected Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba when he dismissed the parliament elected in 1999. In October 2002, he dismissed Deuba and consolidated his power for the first time. During the years 2002 to 2005 he chose and subsequently dismissed three prime ministers, finally dismissing Deuba for the second time and taking over as absolute ruler on 1 February 2005.

Thus, King Gyanendra&apos;s confrontational approach with the established political parties was met with widespread censure. When King Gyanendra took complete control for the second time, on 1 February 2005, he accused Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba &apos;s government of failing to make arrangements for parliamentary elections and of being unable to restore peace in the country, then in the midst of a civil war led by Maoist insurgents.

[ King Gyanendra of Nepal 70px His Royal Majesty Your Royal Majesty Sir ] In April 2006, the Maoists and Sister Organizations staged protests and strikes in Kathmandu against King Gyanendra&apos;s direct rule. The royal government exercised minimum restraint but responded by declaring a curfew to control the deteriorating situation, which was enforced with live firearms and tear gas. On 21 April 2006, King Gyanendra announced that he would yield executive authority to a new prime minister chosen by the political parties to oversee the return of democracy. Several party leaders rejected the offer and again demanded that the King call a council to determine the monarchy&apos;s future role in politics. An agreement was reached between the parties, King under the supervision of Indian ruling Congress including Dr. Karan Singh that monarchy would have a place in the new constitution. Girija Prasad Koirala was appointed prime minister in the interim. Girija Prasad, as the main leader, had talks with the King and the agreement for monarchy&apos;s space. As such, on 24 April 2006, King Gyanendra reinstated the previous parliament in a televised address to the nation. [ End of direct rule ] Mysteriously, the agreement between the parties and King under Indian supervision was not honored by the parties. It is widely believed that the then Prime Minister Girija Prasad saw an opportunity to become the first president of Nepal by declaring Nepal a republic state. On 10 June 2006, the Parliament scrapped the major powers of the King, including his right to veto laws. This ended the idea of a &quot; King in Parliament &quot;, and he was reduced to a figurehead, though for a time he continued to offer felicitations and to receive diplomats. According to Article 167 of the constitution, all executive powers as well as those enjoyed by the King in the previous Constitution were now vested in the prime minister. All powers of the 239-year-old monarchy were stripped, making King Gyanendra a civilian king. Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who previously supported the continuation of the monarchy, said in March, 2007 that he thought the King should step down.

Rather, political outfits and Maoists reached a deal to remove the King. As such, the status of monarchy is itself disputed. [ Interim Suspension of the monarchy ] It was announced on 24 December 2007, that the monarchy would probably be suspended in 2008, following the approval, as part of a peace deal with Maoist rebels, of the Nepalese Parliament in favour of a bill that would see the constitution amended so as to make Nepal a republic.

The interview was published in Japan&apos;s leading newspaper, Daily Yomiuri. Speaking to a select group of Japanese correspondents at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace on 4 February, King Gyanendra said, &quot; (The decision) doesn&apos;t reflect the majority view of the people. This isn&apos;t democracy. &quot; He, however, conceded that the people do have the right to choose the fate of the monarchy. The King also said the law and order in the country was deteriorating, questioning the interim government&apos;s ability to govern the country even after he had accepted the roadmap of the seven-party alliance. Citing the recent survey which showed 49 percent of respondents favoured the continuation of the monarchy in some form, King Gyanendra claimed, &quot; A majority of the people find great meaning in the institution of the monarchy. In all clouds, there is a silver lining. Let us hope. &quot; Gyanendra had broken his closely guarded silence in an interview with a Nepali pro-monarchist weekly paper in which he said he remained silent to &quot; let the peace process succeed. &quot; The King said, &quot; Nepalese people themselves should speak out on where the nation is heading, on the direction it is taking and on why it is becoming chaotic. &quot; He claimed that his attempt on 1 February 2005 was for a good purpose—restoring peace and stability in the country. He said that his attempt wasn’t a success and so the countrymen are suffering at present. In an interview taken with the King’s ‘advisor’, Bharat Keshar Singh, he claimed that the bill passed from the parliament was a bluff. Replying to the question raised regarding the King’s silence even after the bill was passed declaring the state a republic, he said that there was nothing for which the King had to respond. He claimed that the parliament which declared a republic was reinstated by the King himself and has no authority to dethrone the same King. He claimed that the King was examining the activities of the government and the parliament and was waiting for a suitable time for responding to them. He said that no people would accept the ‘bill’ unless decided by a referendum or elected members in the constituent assembly. On 15 January 2007, the interim parliament was set up with CPN-M included, and on 1 April 2007, the interim government joined by CPN-M was formed. On 28 December 2007, the Nepali interim parliament approved a bill for the amendment to the constitution of 1990 promulgated on 15 January 2007, with a clause stating that Nepal will turn into a federal democratic republic, to be implemented by the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly elections.
