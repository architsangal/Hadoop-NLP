Thereafter, Mountain Branch near Raton Pass became more popular with traders, immigrants, gold-seekers, and government supply trains. West of Cimarron is Palisades Sill, with high cliffs surrounding a modest flow of the Cimarron River. In 1842, Lucien B. Maxwell, a fur trapper, came to the Beaubien-Miranda Ranch in northern New Mexico and courted and married Luz Beaubien, one of the owner&apos;s six daughters. He eventually inherited the ranch and built a huge mansion in 1858 on the future town site. Lucien B. Maxwell built the Aztec Mill in 1864. It is preserved as the Old Mill Museum, operated by the Cimarron Historical Society. The museum&apos;s collection includes working mill parts, Native American tools, weapons and pottery; Maxwell Land Grant paperwork and documents, and other materials as well. Cimarron was officially chartered in 1859 and was named for the Spanish word used to describe a mustang, meaning &quot; wild &quot; and &quot; unbroken &quot;. Cimarron was the county seat of Colfax County beginning in 1872, when it replaced Elizabethtown. At that time, Cimarron was a stage stop on the Mountain Branch of the Santa Fe Trail. In 1881, the county seat was moved to Springer, a town on the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway. It was during this time that Lucien Maxwell sold the Maxwell Land Grant to a group of investors, with the resultant Colfax County War in which more than two hundred persons were killed. [ Final homeport of USS Cimarron ] As a tribute to many dedicated crew members, USS Cimarron &apos;s key artifacts were donated to Cimarron, since it is the closest village to the Cimarron River &apos;s headwaters at Eagle Nest, New Mexico. Her ship&apos;s bell became the village high school&apos;s bell. [ Geography ] Cimarron is located at [ 36 30 34 N 104 54 56 W type:city ] (36.509467, -104.915496) [ 1 ].
