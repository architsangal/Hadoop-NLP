The population was 21,861 at the 2000 census. [ History ] [ Early Settlement ] The farmers who first moved to what is now Selden in the mid-18th century referred to the area as Westfield (or sometimes as Westfields). One of the better known early residents was Captain Daniel Roe (1740–1820), who fought in the French and Indian War and served as a captain in the Revolutionary War, { Register of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution p. 528 (1899) } and for whom Captain Daniel Roe Highway is named. Roe built a house in Selden along Middle Country Road before the Revolutionary War. { Mott-Spahr Photo Gallery – Roe Family } Roe is buried in a small family cemetery south of Middle Country road behind the Old Westfield shopping center. { Roe Family Cemetery, Longislandgenealogy.com, Retrieved 2009-10-22 } [ Historic Long Island: Captain Daniel Roe, Selden The Long Islander Dec. 10, 1953 Oct. 22, 2009 ] From The Diary of Captain Daniel Roe, 1806–08 (1904), caption reads: &quot; School house near home of Capt. Daniel Roe. Near the tree, at the right, tradition says the Tory Captain Richard Miller fell from his horse in 1776. &quot; Roe sided with the Patriots in the lead-up to the Revolutionary War. In the fall of 1776, Roe was assigned to lead a raid against the Tory and Hessian detachment near Selden led by his cousin Richard Miller. Miller was a wanted man, and Roe himself had pledged 10 pounds of the bounty offered for Miller&apos;s capture. When Miller rode right by Roe&apos;s house in uniform, he was confronted by Roe&apos;s men and ordered to dismount. Instead, Miller fired his pistol and turned to flee, whereupon he was shot by the militiamen. Miller was then carried into Roe&apos;s house, where he died.

Originally named District 25, it was renumbered as District 12 in 1842, { Records of the Town of Brookhaven (1796–1856), Port Jefferson, Times Steam Job Print, 1888 } which it remained as until the formation of the Middle Country Central School District in 1957. When a post office was opened in 1852, Westfield had already been taken as a name by a community upstate. Upstate attorney (and later judge) Henry Selden promised to do &quot; something handsome &quot; if the town named itself after him. The name was adopted, though it is usually said to be unknown whether he ever followed through on his promise, [ http://www.newsday.com/topic/ny-historytown-hist005y%2C0%2C2725015.story Newsday: Selden History 2009-05-29 ] and probably did not. { Bayles, Richard Mather. Historical and Descriptive Sketches of Suffolk County (Port Jefferson, New York, 1874) } While some sources report that the attorney had no known connection to the community, one newspaper reported in 1958 that Selden and attorney Edward Boyle (the namesake for Boyle Road) acquired a large tract of land in the hamlet shortly before the post office opened, and started to develop it. [ The Name of Selden The Long Islander Mar. 6, 1958 ] As of 1885, Selden was home to 88 residents and a Presbyterian church (built in 1857), and noted for producing melons and early garden vegetables from its farms.

That building was renovated in the 1980s and became a branch of the Middle Country Public Library. { WLIW, David Overton, Brookhaven Town Historian on Selden, 1993 } The main thoroughfare in town, Middle Country Road, was paved from Smithtown and through Selden to Coram around 1927-8. The rural nature of Selden soon began to change, when in 1931 (when it had around 131 residents ), real estate agents began marketing small lots to New York City residents as retreats from urban living, in a development called &quot; Nature&apos;s Gardens &quot;. This was located on the south side of Middle Country Road and Evergreen Drive. Suburban development increased in earnest in the early 1950s, and by the early 1970s Selden had become a primarily suburban community.
