It was formed as the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia in 1916, became the Returned Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmens Imperial League of Australia in 1940, and became the Returned Services League of Australia in 1965. The change to its current name was made in 1990 to reflect the organisation&apos;s concern for current as well as former servicemen and servicewomen. The patron of the RSL is Queen Elizabeth II. The current National President of the League is Rear Admiral Ken Doolan, AO RAN (rtd). As of 31 December 2009, the League comprised 186,652 members from 1,306 sub-branches and 5,533 members of the League&apos;s women&apos;s auxiliary from 381 sub-branches. Membership levels have been declining for at least ten years.

[ History ] { Constitution Avenue, } { Canberra, near the } { Australian Defence Force Russell Offices HQ } The League evolved out of concern for the welfare of returned servicemen from the (1914 – 1918) first World War. [ http://www.clubsonline.com.au/customdata/index.cfm?fuseaction%3Ddisplay_main%26amp%3BItemID%3D3829%26amp%3BOrgID%3D1689%26amp%3Bdts%3D3052011401040 How the League Evolved About the RSL Returned and Services League of Australia 2010 30 May 2011 ] During 1916, a conference recommended the formation of The Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA) which included representation from Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. New South Wales was admitted to the League the following year, and Western Australia in 1918. In 1927, the Australian Capital Territory formed a branch and was admitted. In 1940, the name of the League changed to the Returned Sailors&apos; Soldiers&apos; and Airmens Imperial League of Australia (RSSAILA), and a subsequent change of name took effect in 1965, as the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL). Two more name changes occurred, in 1983 to Returned Services League of Australia Limited (RSL) and in 1990 to Returned &amp; Services League of Australia Limited (RSL). The objects of the League remain relatively unchanged from its first incorporation. [ RSL badge symbolism ] At the top of the badge is the Crown signifying allegiance to Queen and country. Below the crown are the national flowers of Australia, Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland – the wattle, the leek, the rose, the thistle, and the shamrock. In the centre of the badge are a sailor, soldier, an airman and service woman who are marching with their arms linked, symbolising friendship and that all services, and all ranks, are united in comradeship. The red of the badge is symbolic of the blood tie of war. The white background stands for the purity of motive – and to render service without personal gain. The blue is a symbol of willingness to render service to a comrade anywhere under the blue sky.

[ Influence ] The influence of the League comes from its founding days organising rituals for Anzac Day dawn service s and march, and Remembrance Day commemorations. However, even as early as the 1920&apos;s, the role of the League became controversial as it banned women from attending the dawn service because of their wailing.

It was politically conservative, Anglophilic, and monarchist. Many veterans from the Vietnam War found the RSL, dominated by the ranks of World War II veterans, an unwelcoming, alien environment, and chose not to participate, but have over the past 20 years become actively involved. This may have been reflective of the changing status of Vietnam veterans in the 1970s and 80s. (See also Social attitudes and treatment of Vietnam veterans ) Nevertheless the focus of the RSL is above all on the welfare of Australian men and women serving in the armed forces. It has advocated for veterans entitlements, the protection of former battlefields and the rights of serving soldiers, sailors and airmen. The RSL also ensures that those that have served the country are commemorated for their service by providing funeral information to those that have served with the deceased and handing out individual red poppy flowers at the funeral to ensure that the deceased service to their country is acknowledged (see In Flanders Fields ). In 2003 Peter Phillips, the National President, endorsed a statement criticising the decision of the Howard government to send forces to Iraq without a mandate from a United Nations Security Council resolution. [ Organisation ] { Wagga Wagga Sub-Branch } The League is overseen by a National Executive that consists of the National President; the Deputy National President; state Branch Presidents for New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia; and the National Secretary, the National Treasurer, the National Legal Advisor, the National Defence Advisor, and Veterans&apos; Affairs Advisor.

The venues were established to provide hospitality for war veterans and a place for war veterans to build on their comradeship. The venues were often located on land granted by the State government.

The membership base of the licensed clubs differs significantly from membership of the League. Membership of the League does not automatically confer rights of entry or membership to a licensed club. In recent years, in some justistictions, serving members of the ADF are granted honorary membership to a licensed RSL (or similar) club.

Its history originated from an aged care hostel provided to accommodate 64 ex-servicemen that opened in Taringa, Queensland in 1938. A second facility for 80 residents was opened in Caboolture in 1947, and two more facilities in 1968 and 1975, respectively, including a 30-bed nursing home.
