Contemporary Ordnance Survey maps show that this wood remained at least until the 1870s but had been cleared for development by the mid-1890s. It is home to 12th Century ruin Merton Priory, one of 38 places in the UK currently being considered by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to go forward as British candidates for World Heritage status in 2011. Henry VI, the only king of England to be crowned outside of Westminster Abbey in the last 1,000 years, held his coronation ceremony at Merton Priory in 1437. Among those educated at the priory were Thomas Becket and Nicholas Breakspear, [ November 2011 ] who was the only ever English Pope. Close to Merton Priory is the market and heritage centre at Merton Abbey Mills, which is on the bank of the River Wandle. The Wandle was reputed to have more mills per mile than any other river in the world - 90 mills along its 11 mile length. William Morris, at the forefront of the Arts and Crafts Movement, relocated his dyeworks to Merton Abbey Mills, after determining that the water of the Wandle was suitable for dyeing. The complex, on [ 7 acre m2 ], included several buildings and a dyeworks, and the various buildings were soon adapted for stained-glass, textile printing, and fabric- and carpet-weaving. { Parry, William Morris, p. 57 }. The works closed in 1940. The site is now occupied by a large shared Sainsbury/M &amp; S supermarket complex (originally a SavaCentre opened on 28 February 1989 with [ 107430 sqft m2 on ] of sales area, making it the largest hypermarket in the UK at the time of its opening).

[ Colliers Wood Tower ] Colliers Wood is dominated by the &quot; Colliers Wood Tower &quot;. Originally named the &quot; Lyon Tower &quot;, { Telegraph.co.uk - Obituary of Ronald Lyon } it was originally occupied as the headquarters of property company Ronald Lyon Holdings but has also been known as &quot; The Vortex &quot; and the &quot; Brown &amp; Root Tower &quot;. When being built, the tower reached the third storey before an error in construction was discovered and it was demolished to begin again. It was voted the ugliest building in London in a 2006 BBC poll [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/05/25/most_hated_building_feature.shtml BBC Poll - Most Hated Building Bbc.co.uk 2011-12-02 ] and one of the 12 ugliest in the UK in a 2005 Channel 4 poll for its programme Demolition. [ http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/D/demolition/worst2.html Demolition Channel4.com 2011-12-02 ] The same BBC poll quoted an architect working for Golfrate Property Management, the current owners, as saying the building was due a make-over and new lease of life. By 2009, the ground and first floor windows and doors had been boarded up, and green netting has been attached across each end to prevent falling debris causing injury to passers by.

By June 2011 the car park was eventually demolished entirely. In Spring 2011, two small samples of decorative cladding were fitted. These were much a lighter colour than the underlying concrete surface and would change the look of the Tower significantly if installed across the building.
