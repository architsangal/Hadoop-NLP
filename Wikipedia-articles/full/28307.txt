Gundry - 1996 } [ May 2012 ] Many, though not all, crimes are also regarded as sins. Some sins are regarded as greater than others, and in this nuanced concept of sin, sins fall in a spectrum from least corrupt and evil to the greatest evil. [ May 2012 ] In Catholicism, sins which are least corrupt are regarded as venial sins —such sins may be regarded as parts of human living, and carry little divine consequence. Conversely sins which are of great evil may be regarded as mortal sin s —sins which are said to have the dire consequence of mortal penalty. Sins of careless living are considered destructive and lead to greater sins according to the Seven Deadly Sins. Another concept of sin deals with those things which exist on Earth, but not in Heaven. Food, for example, while a necessary good for the (health of the temporal ) body, is not of ( eternal ) transcendental living and therefore its excessive savoring is considered a sin. { Hanegraaff, Hank. &quot; The Bible Answer Book &quot; pg. 18-21.

Human beings were created because of God&apos;s immeasurable love. However, the Bahá&apos;í teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God&apos;s love. [ Buddhism ] [ Buddhist views on sin ] Buddhism does not recognize the idea behind sin, but believes in the principle of karma, whereby suffering is the inevitable consequence of greed, anger, and delusion (known as the Three poisons ). { Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, &quot; Three Poisons &quot; : &quot; Greed, anger, and foolishness. The fundamental evils inherent in life that give rise to human suffering. &quot; } While there is no Buddhist equivalent of the Abrahamic concept of sin, wrongdoing is recognized in Buddhism. The concept of Buddhist ethics is consequentialist in nature and is not based upon duty towards God. [ Christianity ] [ Hamartiology Christian views on sin ] [ Biblical law in Christianity ] In Western Christianity, sin is believed to alienate the sinner from God. It has damaged, and completely severed, the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through repentance and acceptance of Jesus Christ and his death on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice for mankind&apos;s sin. In Eastern Christianity, sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and between people and God. Sin is seen as the refusal to follow God&apos;s plan, and the desire to be &quot; like God &quot; (Genesis 3:5) and thus in direct opposition to God&apos;s will (see the account of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis ). [ Original sin ] [ Original sin ] Original sin is the concept that sin entered the human world through Adam and Eve &apos;s sin in the Garden of Eden, and that human beings have since lived with the consequences of this first sin. { Catholic Encyclopedia, &quot; Original sin &quot;, http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11312a.htm } [ Gradations of sin ] In Catholicism, sins which are least corrupt are regarded as venial sin s —such sins may be regarded as parts of human living, and carry little divine consequence. Conversely, sins which are of great evil may be regarded as mortal sin s —sins which are said to have the dire consequence of mortal penalty. Sins of careless living are considered destructive and lead to greater sins according to the Seven Deadly Sins. Another concept of sin deals with those things which exist on Earth, but not in Heaven. Food, for example, while a necessary good for the (health of the temporal ) body, is not of ( eternal ) transcendental living and therefore its excessive savoring is considered a sin. { Hanegraaff, Hank. &quot; The Bible Answer Book &quot; pg. 18-21. ISBN 0-8499-9544-2 } The Unforgivable sin (or eternal sin) is a sin which can never be forgiven. [ Hinduism ] { In } { Hinduism, the term sin ( } [ pāpa ] { in } { Sanskrit ) is often used to describe actions that create negative } { karma by violating moral and ethical codes, which automatically brings negative consequences. It is different from other religions like Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the sense that sin is not a crime against the will of God, but against (1) } { Dharma, or moral order, and (2) one&apos;s own self. } [ Islam ] [ Islamic views on sin ] Muslims see sin (dhanb, thanb ذنب) as anything that goes against the commands of God ( Allah ). Islam teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being. The Qur&apos;an teaches that &quot; the soul is certainly prone to evil, unless the Lord does bestow His Mercy &quot; and that even the prophets do not absolve themselves of the blame. [ 12 53 ] It is believed that Iblis (Satan) has a significant role in tempting humankind towards sin. In Islam, there are several gradations of sin: sayyia, khatia: mistakes (Suras 7:168; 17:31; 40:45; 47:19 48:2) itada, junah, dhanb: immorality (Suras 2:190,229; 17:17 33:55) haraam : transgressions (Suras 5:4; 6:146) ithm, dhulam, fujur, su, fasad, fisk, kufr: wickedness and depravity (Suras 2:99, 205; 4:50, 112, 123, 136; 12:79; 38:62; 82:14) shirk : ascribing a partner to God (Sura 4:48) One may sincerely repent to God for the wrongs committed and seek forgiveness, as stated in the Quran, &quot; Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, remove from us our iniquities, and take to Yourself our souls in the company of the righteous. &quot; (Al-Imran.193/ 3.193). [ Judaism ] [ Jewish views on sin ] Judaism regards the violation of any of the 613 commandments to be a sin. Judaism teaches that sin is an act, and not a state of being. Humankind was not created with an inclination to do evil, but has that inclination &quot; from his youth &quot;.( [ Genesis 8:21 HE ] ) [ Shinto ] Evil deeds fall into two categories in Shinto: amatsu tsumi, &quot; the most pernicious crimes of all &quot;, and kunitsu tsumi, &quot; more commonly called misdemeanors &quot;. { The Essence of Shinto: The Spiritual Heart of Japan by Motohisa Yamakage } [ See also ] Asceticism Actual sin Fall of Man Hamartia Hedonism Internal sin Morality Religious law Sin-offering Taboo Total depravity [ Notes and references ] [ Bibliography ] Hein, David. &quot; Regrets Only: A Theology of Remorse. &quot; The Anglican 33, no. 4 (October 2004): 5-6 Schumacher, Meinolf.
