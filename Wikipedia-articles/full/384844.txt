Other career highlights include placing first in the Amstel Gold Race in 1997, multiple Danish National Championships, and stage wins in the Giro d&apos;Italia. On May 25, 2007 he admitted that he placed first in the Tour de France using banned substances, and he was no longer considered the winner by the tour&apos;s organizers. [ http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/news/story?id%3D2896276 Tour no longer lists Riis as champ after doping admission Associated Press/ESPN 2007-06-07 ] In July 2008 he is back on the list of Tour winners, but with additional notes about his use of doping. [ http://www.letour.fr/2009/TDF/COURSE/docs/histo2009_05.pdf ASO 95 Guide Historique Augendre, Jacques French 18 August 2009 2009 ] [ Career ] Riis began cycling at local club Herning CK. When he was not selected for the 1984 Summer Olympics, former cyclist Kim Andersen advised Riis to start his professional career not in Italy, but in Luxembourg. [ http://www.wielercentrum.com/tourdefrance/achtergronden/tourwinnaars/1996--Bjarne-Riis-812.html 1996: Bjarne Riis tourdefrance.nl Dutch 18 August 2009 12 May 2003 ] His professional career started in 1986, his first result was a fifth place finish in the GP Wallonie that year. Following a few years with no personal wins, he had yet to impress when his contract ran out in 1988. At the 1988 Tour of European Community race, while riding for the Toshiba team, Riis and fellow Danish rider Kim Eriksen were contacted by the former Tour de France winner Laurent Fignon from the Système U team. Fignon was leading the Tour of European Community race, but he needed a few riders to help him secure the victory. In the hope of earning a contract with Système U, { Mader (1995), p. 48-50. } Riis helped Fignon achieve the victory and in December 1988 he moved to sports director Cyrille Guimard &apos;s Système U team as a support rider for Fignon. For the next three years Riis rode as Fignon&apos;s eternal helper in both flat and mountainous terrain, and they became close friends. { Mader (1995), p. 151-152. Afterword by Laurent Fignon. } Riis helped Fignon win the 1989 Giro d&apos;Italia, while Riis himself won his first professional victory as he secured the 9th stage of the Giro. [ Tour de France success ] When Fignon retired in 1992, Bjarne Riis contacted fellow Danish rider Rolf Sørensen, who got him a job as a rider for Italian team Ariostea under sporting director Giancarlo Ferretti. Riis placed first in the Châlon-sur-Marne stage during the 1993 Tour de France and also wore the polka dot jersey for a day. [ http://hemeroteca.elmundodeportivo.es/preview/1993/07/11/pagina-4/1276480/pdf.html El Mundo Deportive Spanish 11 July 1993 18 August 2009 Me encuentro mejor que nunca ] He finished 5th place overall, which was the best Danish result in Tour history at the time, bettering former World Champion Leif Mortensen &apos;s 6th place finish in the 1971 Tour de France. Riis was ill during the 1994 Tour de France but went on a break-away and then racing solo for the last 30  km of the day. With the sprinter teams chasing him, he placed first on the stage by just a few seconds. Riis finished 3rd at the 1995 Tour de France, the first Dane to reach the podium in Paris, and was named the sensation of the 1995 Tour. [ http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article646922.ece/Bjarne_Riis_en_Ivan_Gotti_laten_zich_niet_langer_knechten Bjarne Riis-en-Ivan Gotti laten zich niet langer knechten Volkskrant 21 July 1995 18 August 2009 Dutch Wybren de boer ] For the 1996 season, Riis was brought on to the Telekom team as team captain. Following his excellent showing in the high climbs of the 1995 Tour, Riis was confident that he was capable of winning. He asked his new teammates to support him, and convinced them that if they worked for him he could bring the yellow jersey to Team Telekom. By the start of the Tour he was in superb condition, winning the Danish Road Racing Championship the week before the prologue. As a result of snow on both the Col de l&apos;Iseran and the Col du Galibier, the scheduled 190  km stage 9 from Val-d&apos;Isère to Sestriere in Italy was truncated and reduced to a 46  km sprint from Le-Monetier-les-Bains which was claimed by Riis, opening a 44 second gap over his teammate Jan Ullrich. By the Tour&apos;s end Riis had placed first in the General Classification, with a lead of 1:41 over his young teammate Ullrich. In so doing he ended the string of five successive victories won by Tour great Miguel Indurain. The win by Riis was instrumental in turning Telekom from a second tier cycling team which struggled just to be invited into the 1995 Tour, into one of the biggest teams in road racing. It also had a huge positive effect on the development of cycling in both Denmark and Germany, massively increasing spectator interest and participation in the sport as well. In 1997, he placed first in the spring classic Amstel Gold Race, with a great effort, riding solo from a long way out, in pouring rain. Bjarne Riis was the favourite at the 1997 Tour de France, but instead it was his young German teammate Jan Ullrich, who won the overall competition, with Riis finishing 7th. On his way to the startup at stage 2 of the 1999 Tour de Suisse, Bjarne Riis hit the curb and crashed. The sustained injuries to his elbow and knee ultimately forced him to retire in the spring of 2000 at the age of 36. [ Doping allegations ] In the aftermath of the performance enhancing drugs crisis in cycling following the 1998 Tour de France, Riis acquired the nickname of Mr. 60%, a suggestion that he has used doping. [ http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/sports/02iht-CYCLING.1.12517063.html New York Times Jeremy Whittle Bjarne Riis&apos;s year without lying: &apos;Now I feel free&apos; 2 May 2008 18 August 2009 ] [ http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/interviews.php?id%3Driders%2F2009%2Finterviews%2Fbjarne_riis_mar091 Bjarne Riis: Bearing the burden of truth 11 March 2009 18 August 2009 Cyclingnews ] The 60% is an allusion to a high hematocrit (red blood cell) level, an indication of EPO usage. It has been published, but never proven, that Riis had a hematocrit level of 56% during one test in July 1995; [ http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/1999/jan99/jan14.shtml 14 January 1999 18 August 2009 Cyclingnews Danish TV claim Riis used drugs in 1995 ] well above typical natural levels, as well as his published reading of 41% in the offseason earlier that year. { Les curieuses statistiques de Gewiss, Cyclisme &amp; Dopage } The earliest mention of the nickname can be traced to interviews with riders of Festina in 1998–2000, who apparently suggested that if they had been doped above 50%, then Riis must have been doped to at least 60%, { Sample chapter of John Wilcockson, &quot; The 2007 Tour de France: A New Generation Takes the Stage &quot;, 2007. ISBN 1-934030-10-4 } since he was able to win the Tour de France in 1996 ahead of the Festina rider Richard Virenque : in Willy Voet &apos;s book Breaking the Chain, he mentions that Festina&apos;s team doctor would not allow EPO to be administered if a rider&apos;s hematocrit level was near 55%. [ Breaking the Chain: Drugs and Cycling: The True Story Voet Willy Fotheringham, William 0-224-06117-8 2002 Random House ] Bjarne Riis never tested positive as a rider, though no EPO test existed at that time. Reports have noted, however, that police in Italy found evidence that Riis may have been among riders treated with EPO in 1994 and 1995 by medical researchers under Professor Francesco Conconi at the University of Ferrara, which resulted in prosecutions against Conconi and also involved Michele Ferrari. [ http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/2000/oct00/oct30news.shtml 30 October 2000 Cyclingnews More doping allegations 18 August 2009 ] Files used in the court case apparently showed fluctuations in Riis&apos; hematocrit from 41% to 56.3%. Speculations about Bjarne Riis&apos;s doping use was further fuelled by his ambiguous denials. When asked whether he used doping he repeatedly stated that &quot; I have never tested positive &quot;. A statement that falls somewhat short of an outright denial. { Bjarne Riis: Jeg har taget doping, Politiken } [ Doping admission ] On 21 May 2007, Riis&apos; former Telekom-team mate Bert Dietz admitted that he had used doping during his Telekom-time. [ http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/news/story?id%3D2878444 Dietz says Telekom doctors offered EPO 22 May 2007 18 August 2009 ESPN Associated Press ] This prompted other former team mates, Christian Henn and Udo Bölts, and two former team doctors, to admit their involvement in doping.

The reactions on Riis&apos;s admission have been truly mixed. Some critics have stamped him as a cheater, and claimed that the results Riis has achieved in his career are worthless. [ http://sporten.tv2.dk/cykling/article.php/id-7075030.html Danske aviser hårde ved Riis 2007-06-26 ] Others have argued that Riis is still a worthy winner of 1996 Tour de France, among them Tour de France commentator and bike enthusiast Jørgen Leth. [ http://sporten.tv2.dk/cykling/article.php/id-7072754.html Intet ændret for Jørgen Leth 2007-06-26 ] [ Team manager ] Following his retirement, a new life opened up. Bjarne Riis had from the start been one of the people behind Danish cycling team [ SAX 1999 ], which became the first Danish team competing in the Tour de France. Following doping allegations and suspension of Home-Jack &amp; Jones rider Marc Streel in 1999, Home withdrew its sponsorship. Bjarne Riis bought the majority of the team through its controlling company Professional Cycling Denmark (PCD), and he became the team manager. In 2001, the team changed sponsor to CSC/World Online, then CSC/Tiscali, and in the seasons 2003 to 2007 the American IT company CSC was the sole sponsor of Team CSC. In season 2008 CSC shared the sponsorship with the Danish bank Saxo Bank which as of season 2009 has been the sole team sponsor. Riis renamed PCD to Riis Cycling A/S in 2003. Before the 2005 season, Team CSC had financial problems and some of the riders were asked to take a wage cut. Riis used his own money to keep the team running throughout his first years as team manager, an expenditure he later vowed never to repeat { Werge (2005), p. 149 } when a new sponsor deal was signed during the 2005 Tour de France. As a team manager, his team has been involved in some doping cases, with no rider being convicted for using doping while on his team. However, Ivan Basso, who was Team CSC&apos;s 2006 Tour de France general classification contender was removed from the team prior to the beginning of the Tour according to the UCI ProTour rules due to his possible involvement in the Operación Puerto doping case, [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/30/AR2006063000332.html Doping Scandal Rocks Cycling John Ward Anderson 1 July 2006 The Washington Post 18 August 2009 ] an involvement confirmed by Basso himself in April 2007.
