[ History ] [ July 2010 ] Surry is situated on the west bank of Union River bay, in Hancock County. On the north-east it is bounded by Ellsworth, on the south-west, by Blue Hill, on the west, by Orland and Penobscot. The town has an area of about [ 21,025 acre km2 ]. Toddy Pond forms part of the boundary between Surry and Penobscot, and on the line between Surry and Ellsworth are the two Patten ponds whose outlet is Patten Stream. Fishways were constructed to these ponds in 1872, and the ponds have since been stocked with alewives and salmon. The surface of the town is considerably broken. The land generally is valuable for tillage. The most of the surface soil is so intermingled with comminuted quartz, or siliceous sand, that cranberries grow in the grass fields. The cultivation of this crop is receiving increased attention. A large deposit of nearly pure silica in the town may prove of much value for glass and other ware. Over miles of surface on the Toddy Pond road lay, a few years ago, a bleak profusion of granite boulders. To-day those boulders are seen in every stage of ruin. On every hand they are smitten with decay, and here and there a patch of unworn gravel is all that remains of a once great boulder. A few miles beyond. these, is a field of immense boulders, still uncrumbled, lying in wild confusion boulder on boulder. The manufactories of Surry are a lumber, shingle, spool and two stave mills. Formerly there was a large business done in building small vessels, but it is now very much reduced. Surry has two mining companies, the Blue Hill Bay and the East Surry Company. Surry was Township No. 6, in the grant to Marsh and others. It was first occupied by the French at Newbury Neck. The first English settlers were Symonds, Weymouth and James Flye. The next settlers were John Patten, a Mr. Hopkinson, Andrew Flood, Wilbrahim Swett, Matthew and James Ray, Samuel Joy, Isaac Lord, Hezekiah Coggins and Leonard Jarvis. Mr. Jarvis represented the eastern district in Congress from 1831 to 1837. Up to 1820, about [ 13,000 acre km2 ] had been secured to settlers and by quiet possession titles, when Mr. Jarvis bought the remainder. In 1800, Surry included that portion of Ellsworth known as Ward 5; but in 1829 it was re-annexed to Ellsworth. There was a population of 289 as early as 1790. In 1874, a small quantity of silver coin was found at Weymouth Point. Surry furnished 135 men to the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion! The Baptist, Free Baptist and Methodist denominations have churches in town. There are nine public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $3,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $207,137. In 1880 it was $177,534. The population in 1870 was 1,242. In 1880 it was 1,185. &quot; { From George J. Varney&apos;s A Gazetteer of the State of Maine, published in Boston, Massachusetts in 1886: } [ Recent ] The National Weather Service in Caribou, Maine established a cooperative weather station at East Surry, Maine in July 2007. The NWS station named, Ellsworth-3SSW serves as an official meteorological recording site, providing daily weather and climate information to the (NWS) National Weather Service, (NCDC) National Climatic Data Center, CoCoRaHS (Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network), and CWOP (Citizens Weather Observer Program). The station (Ellsworth-3SSW) continues the climate history of Ellsworth, Maine dating back to the 1930s. The cooperative station is located at an elevation of 105 feet about 2 miles east of Surry village. The National Weather Service in Caribou, Maine renamed the station to EAST SURRY on July 1, 2011... This station begins a new climate history for East Surry, as it was found to be not compatible to the old ELLSWORTH POLL CONTROL station. The new data set begins on JUNE 1, 2007 from the East Surry location.
