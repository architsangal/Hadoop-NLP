Kojima has said that early on in his life he often had to deal with death. [ 2004-04-22 EDGE Magazine 136 69–74 Hideo Kojima Versus the Big Robots ] { An unofficial transcription is available on metalgearsolid.org } When he was little the Kojima family moved to a small city called Shirasaki. Just as quickly, his family soon moved to Kawanishi, Hyōgo in the Kansai region. Kojima has noted that growing up he was a latchkey kid, often having to watch television and look after himself when he came home from school. Staying at home by himself in isolation still affects him to this day stating, &quot; [whenever] I travel and stay at a hotel I put the TV on as soon as I enter the room, just to deal with the feeling of loneliness. &quot; Initially wanting to be an artist or illustrator, he was often discouraged by societal norms of Japan which favored finding safe and well paying jobs. He was also discouraged because his uncle was also an artist but suffered from financial difficulties. He eventually started writing short stories and began to send them to Japanese magazines but was never able to get anything published. He cites that his stories were often 400 pages long while most magazines wanted their short stories to be around 100 pages. Eventually he shifted his focus to making films with his friend who had an 8mm camera.

Kojima grew up early in life watching movies with his parents. While studying economics in university, Kojima found himself playing video games during his free time, mainly games on the Famicom. In his fourth year in university, Kojima surprised colleagues by announcing his intentions to join the video game industry, despite initially having ambitions of becoming a film director. [ http://archive.gamespy.com/e32003/interview/gba/1002714/ Hideo Kojima Interview GameSpy Steven Kent 2003-05-18 2008-03-12 ] He felt a career in video games would be more satisfying. [ Retro Gamer Imagine Publishing Before They Were Famous 35 74 John Szczepaniak ] Kojima has cited Shigeru Miyamoto &apos;s Super Mario Bros.

[ 1980s ] Kojima tried joining the game business but was unable to do so at first. His game design ideas were rejected but he never gave up and eventually he was accepted. He joined video game publisher Konami &apos;s MSX home computer division in 1986 as a designer and &apos;planner&apos;. Initially, he was disappointed with his assignment, and desired to work on Nintendo Entertainment System and arcade games instead—Kojima felt the color palette of the system was too restrictive. Kojima&apos;s gameplay ideas were often overlooked initially, and due to his lack of familiarity with programming was repeatedly snubbed for his failures in his initial years at Konami. At one point Kojima considered leaving the company, but he hung on. The first game he worked on was Penguin Adventure, the sequel to Antarctic Adventure, as an assistant director. It significantly expanded upon the gameplay of Antarctic Adventure, adding more action game elements, a greater variety of levels, RPG elements such as upgrading equipment, [ /penguin-adventure Penguin Adventure ] and multiple endings. { Penguin Adventure, } { GameSpot } The first game he actually developed was Lost Warld, a platform game starring a masked female wrestler, in [ 1986 ]. However, the game was ultimately rejected by Kojima&apos;s superiors at Konami. Kojima was asked to take over a project, Metal Gear, from a senior associate. Hardware limitations hindered development of the game&apos;s combat. Inspired by The Great Escape, Kojima altered the gameplay to focus on a prisoner escaping. It was released in [ 1987 ] for the MSX 2 home computer in Japan and parts of Europe. The game centers around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake, who is sent to the fortified state of &quot; Outer Heaven &quot; to stop a nuclear equipped walking tank known as &quot; Metal Gear &quot;. Metal Gear is one of the earliest examples of the stealth action game genre, where avoiding encounters from the enemies is emphasized over direct combat. A port of Metal Gear was also released for the Nintendo Entertainment System through Konami&apos;s Ultra Games division. Kojima was not directly involved in the production of this version and he has openly criticized some of the changes made in this version. His next project was the graphic adventure game Snatcher, released for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2 computer platforms in Japan in [ 1988 ]. The game, influenced by science fiction works such as Blade Runner, The Terminator, and Bubblegum Crisis, is set in a post-apocalyptic world and centers around an amnesia c detective who faces a race of cyborg s (the titular Snatchers) that kill their victims, copy their likeness and assume their place in society. While Kojima and his team wrote the entire story of the game, they were forced to leave out the final act of the game due to time constraints. The game was highly regarded at the time for pushing the boundaries of video game storytelling, cinematic cut scene s, and mature content, { Retroactive: Kojima&apos;s Productions, } { 1UP } and was praised for its graphics, soundtrack, high quality writing comparable to a novel, voice acting comparable to a film or radio drama, post-apocalyptic setting, light gun shooter segments, and in-game computer database with optional documents that flesh out the game world. The Sega CD version of Snatcher was for a long time the only major visual novel game to be released in America, however, partly due to a Teen rating limiting its accessibility, { Kurt Kalata, Snatcher, Hardcore Gaming 101 } it only sold a &quot; couple of thousand units &quot;, according to Jeremy Blaustein, a member of Snatcher&apos;s localization team. [ http://junkerhq.net/Jeremy.html JUNKER HQ (Interview with Jeremy Blaustein by Chris Barker) Blaustein: As for (Snatcher): Sega CD, I think that counting you and me, the game only sold a couple thousand units at most in the US. I know the Sega CD sucked and had no software available for it, but where was everyone when Snatcher came out!? Boy, was that embarrassing - having it fail so badly. ] [ 1990s ] In [ 1990 ] Kojima was involved in the productions of two MSX2 games: a spinoff of Snatcher titled SD Snatcher; and a sequel to Metal Gear titled Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which further evolved the stealth game genre. The player had more abilities, such as crouching, crawling into hiding spots and air ducts, distracting guards by knocking on surfaces, and using a radar to plan ahead. The enemies had improved AI, including a 45-degree field of vision, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen, and a three-phase security alarm. The game also had improved graphics and a complex storyline dealing with themes such as the nature of warfare and nuclear disarmament. [ Kojima&apos;s Legacy: We reflect on the influence of Hideo Kojima&apos;s 20 years in gaming Mark Ryan Sallee IGN http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/715/715932p1.html 2009-08-20 ] [ Paul Soth GOTW: Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake GameSpy http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view%3DGameMuseum.Detail%26amp%3Bid%3D31 2009-08-27 ] SD Snatcher is an RPG which adapts the storyline of the original Snatcher, while featuring its version of the originally planned ending. The characters are depicted in a &quot; super deformed &quot; art style, in contrast to the original game&apos;s realistic style. Like the original computer versions of Snatcher, it was only released in Japan. It abandoned random encounter s and introduced an innovative first-person turn-based battle system where the player can aim at specific parts of the enemy&apos;s body using firearms with limited ammo. Such a battle system has rarely been used since, though similar battle systems based on targeting individual body parts can later be found in Square &apos;s Vagrant Story (2000), Bethesda &apos;s Fallout 3 (2008), and Nippon Ichi &apos;s Last Rebellion (2010). { European date fixed for the action / RPG Last Rebellion ( Translation ), Jeuxvideo.com } Due to the success of the original Metal Gear on the NES, Konami decided to create a sequel to the game, Snake&apos;s Revenge, without the involvement of Hideo Kojima. During a ride home on the train, Kojima met one of the staff member who worked on the game who asked him if he would create a &quot; true &quot; Metal Gear sequel. As a result Kojima began plans for his own sequel titled: Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. The game was only released in Japan for the MSX2 as one of the last games Konami produced for the computer system. The game would not be released overseas in North American and Europe until its inclusion in [ 2006 ] &apos;s Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. All of his subsequent projects after Metal Gear 2 were produced primarily for disc -based media, allowing for the inclusion of voice acting in his games. He remade Snatcher in [ 1992 ] for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM 2. An English localization of the game was produced for the Sega CD in North America and Europe in [ 1994 ]. Kojima was not directly involved in the Sega CD version nor the subsequent PlayStation and Saturn ports released in Japan in [ 1996 ]. In [ 1994 ], Kojima released Policenauts, a film noir / sci-fi -themed adventure game set in a space colony, for the NEC PC-9821. Kojima oversaw the subsequent ports released for the 3DO in [ 1995 ]; and the PlayStation and Saturn in [ 1996 ], which all featured animated cut-scenes not in the PC-98 release. Despite announcements for an English release in 1996, [ http://www.konami.com/pr-e7.htm http://web.archive.org/web/19961109023845/www.konami.com/pr-e7.htm Konami: Policenauts for Saturn Konami 2009-08-11 5 1996 1996-11-09 ] problems with synching the English dialogue with the cut-scenes stopped its production. [ Policenauts: Official Guide 118–122 4-87188-835-5 ] An unofficial English translation patch was released to the public at midnight ( JST ) on August 24, 2009, to coincide with Hideo Kojima&apos;s 46th birthday. { Junker HQ - Release: 8/23/09, 12 PM EDT } From 1997 to 1999, he developed the Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series, a trilogy of visual novel adventure games. [ http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/088/088501p1.html Hideo Kojima Speaks IGN December 12, 2000 2011-08-24 ] With the release of Metal Gear Solid (MGS) in [ 1998 ] for the PlayStation, Kojima became an international celebrity among the video game media. Metal Gear Solid was the first in the Metal Gear series to use 3D graphics and voice acting, which gave a more cinematic experience to the game. MGS was highly regarded for its well-designed gameplay and for its characters and storyline, which featured themes of nuclear proliferation and genetic engineering. [ 2000s ] In early 2001, Kojima released the first details of the sequel to Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, for the PlayStation 2. The game&apos;s highly detailed graphics, physics, and expanded gameplay quickly made it one of the most anticipated games yet.

While MGS2 broke ground with the breadth of its subject matter, the lengthy exposition of these issues, particularly in the bewildering maze of dialogue and plot revelation in the final hours of the game, left a sour taste in the mouths of many gamers, who expected the Hollywood-style resolution of its forerunner. After the release of MGS2, Kojima produced the game and anime franchise Zone of the Enders in 2001 to moderate success. In 2003, he produced Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand for the Game Boy Advance. In this, players take the role of a young vampire hunter who uses a solar weapon which is charged by a photometric sensor on the game cartridge (forcing them to play in sunlight). Another team inside Konami (in a collaboration with Silicon Knights ) began work on Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, a GameCube remake of the first Metal Gear Solid with all the gameplay features of Metal Gear Solid 2 and with cutscenes redirected by action / horror film director Ryuhei Kitamura. It was released in 2004. Afterwards, Kojima also designed and released Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater for the PlayStation 2. Unlike the previous games in the series, which took place in the near future and focused on indoor locations, the game is set in a Russian forest area during the year 1964, and involves wilderness survival and camouflaging. The North American version was released on November 17, 2004, with the Japanese counterpart following on December 16. The European version was released on March 4, 2005. Critical response to the game was highly favorable. At that time Kojima produced Boktai&apos;s sequel, Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django for the Game Boy Advance. Released in summer 2004, it makes more extensive use of the cartridge&apos;s sunlight sensor and allows players to combine various new solar weapons. Also released was Metal Gear Acid for the PlayStation Portable handheld. This turn-based game is less action-oriented than the other Metal Gear games and focuses more on strategy. It was released in Japan on December 16, 2004. Its sequel Metal Gear Acid 2 was released on March 21, 2006. Kojima wanted Solid Snake to appear in Nintendo&apos;s Super Smash Bros. Melee, but due to development cycle problems Nintendo was unable to add Snake in. When Super Smash Bros. Brawl was in development, series producer Masahiro Sakurai, contacted Kojima to work Snake into the game. Kojima also worked on Snake&apos;s stage for SSBB.
