[ November 2009 ] On 13 October 2009, Foster became involved in the parliamentary expenses scandal as he announced through his website that he was being asked to pay back a substantial sum of money in connection with a mortgage he had been claiming for. It was later revealed in the local press that the sum totalled £4,082.02. { http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/MP-Foster-pay-163-4-000/article-1417460-detail/article.html } On 8 December 2010, in response to a call from the Football Supporter&apos;s Federation, he introduced a bill to parliament to introduce safe standing areas into English and Welsh football, the first of its kind since the Taylor Report. { http://www.fsf.org.uk/news/Safe-Standing-Bill-launched-in-Parliament.php } On 9 December 2010, Foster was one of 28 Liberal Democrat MPs to vote in favour of Government proposals to increase the upper limit of university tuition fees. Reasons cited are that there is considerable evidence that many of the poorest people would pay less because of the system of paying back of the loan.
