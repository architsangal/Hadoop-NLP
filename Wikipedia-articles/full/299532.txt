[ Cultivation ] Patchouli grows well in warm to tropical climates. It thrives in hot weather, but not direct sunlight. If the plant withers due to lack of watering, it will recover well and quickly after it has been watered. The seed -producing flower s are very fragrant and bloom in late fall. The tiny seeds may be harvested for planting, but they are very delicate and easily crushed. Cuttings from the mother plant can also be rooted in water to produce additional plants. [ Extraction of essential oil ] Extraction of patchouli&apos;s essential oil is by steam distillation, requiring rupture of its cell wall s by steam scalding, light fermentation, or drying. Leaves may be harvested several times a year, and when dried may be exported for distillation.
