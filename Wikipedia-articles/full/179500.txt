Coors is also renowned for operating the Golden, Colorado brewery, the largest single brewery facility in the world. { Malloy, Betsy. &quot; Coors Brewery - Golden Colorado Coors Brewery. &quot; About.com. The New York Times Company. Web. 10 Jan. 2010. &lt; http://gocalifornia.about.com/cs/codenver/a/codenvercoor.htm &gt;. } [ History ] [ Founding ] In 1873, German immigrants Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler, a Denver businessman, established a brewery in Golden, Colorado. Coors invested $2,000 in the operation in addition to Schueler&apos;s investment of $18,000. In 1880, Coors bought out his partner, becoming sole owner of the company. [ Prohibition ] The Coors Brewing Company managed to survive Prohibition relatively intact. Years before the Volstead Act went into effect nationwide, Adolph Coors with sons Adolph Jr., Grover, and Herman established the Adolph Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company, which included Herold Porcelain and other ventures. The brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility. Coors sold much of the malted milk to the Mars candy company for the production of confection. Manna, the company&apos;s non-alcoholic beer replacement, was a near beer which is similar to current non-alcoholic beverages. However, Coors and sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the Coors Brewing Company afloat. By 1933, after the end of Prohibition, the Coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that survived Prohibition intact. All the non-brewery assets of the Adolph Coors Company were spun off between 1989 and 1992; the descendant of the original Herold Porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as CoorsTek. [ History of CoorsTek http://www.coorstek.com/history.asp 2009-05-19 ] [ Products ] For much of its history, Coors beer was a regional product; its marketing area was confined to the American west. This made it a novelty on the East Coast, and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case. This iconic status was reflected in the 1977 movie Smokey and the Bandit, which centered around an illegal shipment of Coors from Texas to Georgia. The company finally established nationwide distribution in the U.S. in the mid-1980s. In 1959, Coors became the first American brewer to use an all-aluminum two-piece beverage can. Coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant, known as the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), in the world in Golden, Colorado. RMMC is a joint venture between Ball Metal and Coors, having been founded in 2003. In the 1970s, Coors invented the pollution free push tab can; however, consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward. The long and current slogan of &quot; Silver Bullet &quot; to describe Coors Light is not for the beer but for the silver colored can in which the beer is packaged. Coors Light was once produced in the &quot; yellow bellied &quot; cans like Coors Banquet; however, when the yellow coloring was removed and the can was left mostly silver, many dubbed the beer as &quot; The Silver Bullet &quot;.

On July 22, 2004, the company announced it would be merging with Canadian brewer Molson. The merger was completed February 9, 2005, with the merged company being named Molson Coors Brewing Company. In August 2004, the Coors Brewing Company announced plans to add brewing capacity to the Shenandoah beer packaging facility in Elkton, Virginia by early 2007. { Coors to build brewery at Shenandoah, Modern Brewery Age, August 16, 2004 } Coors officials stated that this would &quot; bring brewing capacity much closer to our important East Coast markets and distributors. &quot; { &quot; Coors to build brewery at Shenandoah &quot;. Modern Brewery Age.

The brewery kept operating with supervisors and 250 to 300 union members, including one member of the union executive board who ignored the strike. Soon after, Coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers. [ Adolph Coors Company (A) Business Case, Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pdf/2001-1-0027.pdf 2006-04-24 pdf ] About 700 workers quit the picket line to go back to work, and Coors replaced the remaining 500 workers, keeping the beer production process uninterrupted. { Dana Parsons, Why did strikers return?, Denver Post, 3 October 1979, p,3. } In December 1978, the workers at Coors voted by greater than a two to one ratio to decertify the union, ending 44 years of union representation at Coors. Because the strike was by then more than a year old, striking workers could not vote in the election. { Karen Newman, Coors workers reject union by big margin, } { Rocky Mountain News (Denver), 15 December 1978, p.1 c.2. } Labor unions organized a boycott to punish Coors for its labor practices. { Union at Coors May Be Broken But It Hasn&apos;t Halted Its Boycott, } { The New York Times, May 28, 1979, p. A7 } One tactic employed was a push for state laws to ban sales of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer. { Coors union backing Calif. beer roadblock, Denver Post, 5 December 1977. } Because Coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer, such laws would hurt only Coors. { Bill before Missouri legislature would ban Coors, Denver Post, 2 November 1984. } Sales of Coors suffered during the 10-year labor union boycott, although Coors stated that declining sales were also due to an industry-wide downturn in beer sales, and to increased competition. To maintain production, Coors expanded its sales area from the 18 western states to which it had marketed for years, to nationwide distribution. { Bartell Nyberg, Coors brewing for long-term survival, } { Denver Post 22 February 1987, p.1G, c.1. } The AFL-CIO ended its boycott of Coors in August 1987, after negotiations with Pete Coors, head of brewery operations. The details were not divulged, but were said to include an early union representation election in Colorado, and use of union workers to build the new Coors brewery in Virginia. { AFL-CIO ends 10-year Coors boycott, Denver Post, 19 August 1987. } In 1988, the Teamsters Union, which represented brewery workers at the top three U.S. beer makers at that time ( Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Stroh ), gained enough signatures to trigger a union representation election inside the Coors company. Coors workers again rejected union representation by more than a two to one ratio. { Jeffrey Leib, Coors workers reject union, } { Denver Post, 16 December 1988, p.1A. } [ Minority issues ] A federal lawsuit by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1975 ended in a settlement with Coors agreeing not to discriminate against blacks, Mexican-Americans, and women. [ Adolph Coors Company (A) ( PDF ) Business Case, Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pdf/2001-1-0027.pdf 2006-04-24 ] In 1977, Coors was accused of firing gay and lesbian employees. [ The Dynamics of Brand Legitimacy: An Interpretive Study in the Gay Men&apos;s Community ( PDF ) Journal Article, Journal of Consumer Research, University of Chicago Press 10 ] Coors encouraged the organization of its gay and lesbian employees into the Lesbian and Gay Employee Resource (LAGER) in 1993. { Justin Berton, The other Coors spokesman, } { Westword (Denver) 2 September 1999, p.28. } In May 1995 Coors became the 21st publicly-traded corporation in the United States to extend employee benefits to same-sex partners. { Michael Booth, Coors adds &apos;partners&apos; to benefits, } { Denver Post, 8 July 1995, p.1A. } When company chairman Pete Coors was criticized for the company&apos;s gay-friendly policy during his 2004 Republican primary campaign for one of the US Senate seats from Colorado, he defended the policy as basic good business practice. { John C. Green, Mark J. Rozell, Clyde Wilcox, &apos;&apos;The Values Campaign?&apos;&apos; Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, p.185. } [ Political influence ] Coors family members have played a prominent role in American politics and public policy, supporting many conservative causes. Such causes included providing a $250,000 grant in 1973 to found The Heritage Foundation, { Russ Bellant, The Coors Connection: How Coors Family Philanthropy Undermines Democratic Pluralism, Political Research Associates, 1990, p. 21 } an influential conservative think tank, and, via its parent company, the right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute. Chairman Pete Coors ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate from Colorado in 2004 on the Republican ticket.
