Published by Enix Corporation (now known as Square Enix ), it sets the player in a medieval/fantasy world filled with magic, monsters and knights. Unlike the original Dragon Quest games, the player&apos;s character does not do any of the fighting in battles; instead the player has to rely on capturing, breeding and raising monsters to do the fighting for them. The concept originated from Dragon Quest V (1992). The character and monster designs are by Dragon Ball creator, Akira Toriyama. The series spans several handheld gaming systems and each game has received positive reviews from critics. Upon the series&apos; debut in the US, it was quickly labeled as a &quot; Pokémon clone &quot; by critics.

This was due to Dragon Quest&apos;s North American name being changed due to a trademark conflict with the role-playing game DragonQuest, which was published by Simulation Publications in the 1980s until the company&apos;s bankruptcy in 1982 and purchase by TSR, Inc., which then published it as an alternate line to Dungeons &amp; Dragons until 1987. [ The GameSpy Hall of Fame: Dragon Warrior Gamespy http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492001p1.html May 29, 2005 ] In 2003, Square Enix registered the Dragon Quest trademark in the US, making the Dragon Warrior name obsolete.

Its sequel, Dragon Warrior Monsters 2, also for the Game Boy Color, was released in 2001 in both Japan and North America. There are two versions of the game, similar to &apos;&apos;Pokémon Gold&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Silver&apos;&apos;, called Cobi&apos;s Journey (Ruka&apos;s Journey in Japan) and Tara&apos;s Adventure (Iru&apos;s Adventure in Japan), named after the main characters the player controls.

It features Keifer, a prince from Dragon Warrior VII. Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker, for the Nintendo DS, was released in Japan in 2006 and was the first in the series to feature 3D graphics. [ Bozon http://ds.ign.com/articles/833/833153p1.html IGN: Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker Review Ds.ign.com 2007-11-06 2009-01-07 ] It was brought to North America the next year, and in 2008, was released in the PAL region, making it the second game in the series to do so. Initially revealed through the publication Shonen Jump, the game is set around a tournament referred to as the Joker GP. It also features Wi-Fi multiplayer play through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service and full 3D movement and battles. Unlike the other games in the series, this game has no random battles. Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 was released in Japan on April 28, 2010 and a US release on September 19, 2011, as revealed at the 2011 E3. [ Gameplay ] Although each of the games have distinct differences, they all have similar gameplay to the main Dragon Quest series. Players control the main character, but, unlike in Dragon Quest, the main character does not fight. Caught or bred monsters participate in battles instead of humans, although this changes slightly in Caravan Heart. Battles for the first three games are fought in first-person and are turn-based. Monsters are able to gain experience points just like humans in the main series would and can learn spells and skills straight from the Dragon Quest games. [ Battle system ] Battle from &apos;&apos;Caravan Heart&apos;&apos; Up until Joker, battles were fought against randomly encountered monsters in a first-person view. Joker changed this by allowing players to see enemies on the field as well as making battles three-dimensional. The player controls up to three monsters at once and their HP and MP are displayed onscreen. The player can then choose from several options on what to do. Typically, the player does not directly control the monsters and instead gives them suggestions. Charge tells monsters to use their most direct and powerful attacks. Mixed suggests to monsters to use support abilities, such as shields, stat enhancements, or summons and Cautious tells monsters to use defensive abilities, such as healing and reviving spells and abilities that remove harmful stat effects. During battle, the player can select Plan, which allows the player to change any of the commands. Command gives the player direct control of the party and cannot be used in arena battles. Fight simply makes monsters follow their set commands. The player can also use items during battle, many which are from the Dragon Quest games. The party can also attempt to flee random battles. [ Personalities ] A message may appear that says &quot; will attempt &quot; for some of the commands; this is because each monster is given a certain personality depending on the player&apos;s actions used in combat. Those actions are Charge, Mixed and Cautious, which when used can raise/lower one of three hidden stats, Bravery, Prudence and Caring. Basically this means a monster high in one of the three stats will be better at using an attack of that type and more likely to obey, for example a monster with the Personality type Reckless (which is high in Bravery but low in Prudence and Caring) will be more likely to use a Charge attack, whereas a monster with the Personality type Careful (a type high in Caring but low in Bravery and Prudence) will be more likely to use a Cautious attack. Personalities change quickly at lower levels than at higher levels, also monsters with a high wildness are harder to change personalities. A monster can have one of 27 personalities. [ Wildness ] Another reason monsters might not obey commands is their wildness (WLD in the game). A monster with a high wildness is less likely to obey commands. Newly caught monsters and monsters kept in the farm for long periods of time will have high wildness. To lower a monster&apos;s wildness, the player needs to keep it in the party for a while or feed it meat items. [ Obtaining monsters ] Exploration in &apos;&apos;Caravan Heart&apos;&apos; As with other role-playing video game s once the player&apos;s party defeats the opposing monsters and the battle ends, the party is awarded a certain amount of experience points (EXP) which are used to level up monsters. At the end of the battle, there exists a small chance the opposing monster may join the party. The chance of a monster joining the party is increased by the use of meat items which lowers a monster&apos;s wildness. The more the player uses, the lower the monster&apos;s wildness will be and the more likely it is to join. Certain types of meat lower a monster&apos;s wildness more, thus increasing the chance of catching them. This is true in the first three games. In Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker, the player can actively scout for monsters during battle. Unlike previous games in the series, this is a battle command, and not the result of using items in battle. The player can make any number of scouting attempts during a battle, until the monster decides to join, or takes offense. Success depends on the relative strengths of the monsters making the attempt versus the relative defense of the monster that is being scouted. [ Shau, Austin November 16, 2007 Dragon Quest Monsters Joker http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/dragonquestmonstersjoker/review.html GameSpot.com 2009-10-15 ] [ Breeding ] Breeding monsters has been a large part of the series and is often cited as one of the series&apos; highlights. [ RPGFan Reviews: Dragon Warrior Monsters Reviews http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/dragonwarriormonsters/Dragon_Warrior_Monsters.html RPGFan.com 2009-01-11 ] In the first two games, the player was able to breed two monsters together and create a different monster, usually a combination of its two parents. The parent monsters would disappear after breeding. Caravan Heart changed the system, instead using Monster Hearts to create new monsters. Joker returned to the first system, although the name was changed to Synthesizing.

Each game has sold well in Japan. US releases for the first two games brought on comparisons to the Pokémon franchise, another monster-collecting RPG. However, with the release of Joker for the Nintendo DS game, these comparisons were not as much of a focus in reviews, but still existed. 1UP.com, when reviewing Joker, noted that &quot; the Monsters series has always felt like it belongs in the Dragon Quest universe first and foremost; it&apos;s more than a bunch of bastardized Pokéclones. The latest installment of the subseries -- Joker -- is a perfect example. &quot; [ Parish, Jeremy http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId%3D3164210 1UP.com&apos;s Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker Review 1UP.com 2007-11-06 2009-10-15 ] Each of the games in the series has sold well, particularly in Japan, where the Dragon Quest series has gained immense popularity.
