Retrieved 2012-01-24 } [ Early Life and Career ] Paul Young was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, England. He has an older brother, Mark, and a younger sister, Joanne. As a youth, after school, he played football for the Vauxhall Motors factory and in his spare time played in several bands as a bass guitarist. The first group for which he became lead singer was Kat Kool &amp; The Kool Kats. In the late 1970s he joined Streetband, who had one Top 20 hit in the UK, with the humorous, novelty track &quot; Toast &quot;. In December 1979, Streetband disbanded. The ex-Streetbanders added new recruits Dave Lathwell on guitar and Baz Watts on drums. In addition, a four piece brass section was created by Steve Farr ( baritone saxophone ), Richard Blanchchard ( tenor saxophone ), Stuart Van Blandamer ( alto saxophone ) and Tony Hughes ( trumpet ) who all hailed from the North London and Hertfordshire area, while organist Ian Kewley lived in Essex. Q-Tips&apos; name derived from a well-known brand of cotton swab. Q-Tips&apos; first rehearsals took place in November 1979. Their first gig was on 18 November 1979 at the Queens Arms Hotel in Harrow. This was followed by another at the Horn of Plenty in St Albans  -  a regular gig for Streetband during 1978  -  and a total of sixteen in their first month of existence. Some personnel changes occurred during the first six months, with Blanchard&apos;s departure leaving a three-piece brass section, and Lathwell also leaving the band. By 1 April 1980, the band had recorded two tracks, &quot; SYSLJFM (The Letter Song) &quot;, and &quot; Having A Party &quot;, both recorded at the Livingstone Studios in Barnet. Constant touring and concert appearances had built up a strong fan base by mid 1981, when the small amount of soul music cover version s were outnumbered by the band&apos;s own tracks. [ http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll Q-Tips Huey, Steve Allmusic 2 June 2010 ] The professionalism of the band had attracted the attention of several record label s, with the late Mickie Most ( RAK Records ) confirming on BBC Radio 1 &apos;s Round Table programme that Q-Tips &quot;...are easily the best live band working at the moment &quot;. In August 1980, the British music magazine, NME reported that Q-Tips had just released their debut, self titled album. [ John Tobler 1992 NME Rock &apos;N&apos; Roll Years 1st Reed International Books Ltd London 345 CN 5585 ] In time, Garth Watt Roy was replaced by John Gifford on guitar, and Blandamer was replaced by Nick Payne. This line-up remained for the rest of the band&apos;s career. They appeared on BBC Television &apos;s In Concert, Rock Goes to College and The Old Grey Whistle Test in the latter part of 1981. Other television appearance included children&apos;s Saturday morning TV. Q-Tips opened for The J. Geils Band, The Knack, Thin Lizzy, Bob Marley and the Average White Band. The band toured with After The Fire, and supported The Who on their twelve date UK tour in 1980. In 1981, Q-Tips played the Montreux Jazz Festival. With poor record sales after the release of two albums and seven singles, the Q-Tips broke up in early 1982 when Paul Young signed a solo recording contract with Sony / CBS. In late 1982 and early 1983, the brass section and drummer of Q-Tips toured with Adam Ant on the UK and US legs of his Friend or Foe tour, and some remained for Ant&apos;s 1984 Strip tour. Young briefly teamed up again with Q-Tips for a reunion tour in 1993. [ Work in Music and Media ] { No Parlez &apos;&apos;, released in 1984 Paul Young - No Parlez at Discogs. } { Discogs.com.

He returned to the UK Top Ten with a version of Ann Peebles &apos; &quot; I&apos;m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down &quot;. The latter appeared on his second album, The Secret of Association, released in 1985, which secured his future success in the United States, Japan and Australia. The album went to No. 1 in the UK. However, he continued to have occasional voice and throat difficulties. That year, Young scored the biggest worldwide hit of his career with &quot; Everytime You Go Away &quot;, a version of a Daryl Hall song from a 1980 Hall &amp; Oates album. &quot; Every Time You Go Away &quot; topped the pop charts in the U.S., and was his biggest success in the U.S. He would perform the song during the London segment of the Live Aid concert. { Live Aid: A Look Back At A Concert That Actually Changed The World. } { MTV News.

He contributed to the Vangelis album Voices in 1995. Young sang the British national anthem, &quot; God Save the Queen &quot;, at Wembley Stadium before England&apos;s Euro &apos;96 semi-final match against Germany. In 1995, Young formed his own backing group Los Pacaminos, and first performed with the group in Hyde Park, London the same year. In 1996 however, Young was once again performing solo. By mid-1996, Young made his last full public performance with Tony Hadley, before declining to perform more in nightclub s and pubs so that he could concentrate more on his personal life and family without having to organise tours. In late-1996, Young co-wrote the song &quot; Build Me Up &quot; for Tony Hadley with Hadley. The song was the only song Young had written for another artist, and was recorded into the soundtrack of the 1996 film When Saturday Comes.
