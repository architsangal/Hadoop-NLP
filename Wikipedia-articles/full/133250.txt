A leading conservative, he helped organize and fund the conservative resurgence in the 1970s, aiding Ronald Reagan &apos;s quest for the White House and helping many local and regional candidates. A journalist by training, Helms was the longest-serving popularly-elected Senator in North Carolina&apos;s history, and was widely credited with shifting the one-party state dominated by the Democrats into a competitive two-party state. The Helms-controlled National Congressional Club&apos;s state-of-the-art direct mail operation raised millions for Helms and other conservative candidates allowing Helms to outspend his opponents in most of his campaigns. { William A. Link, Righteous warrior: Jesse Helms and the rise of modern conservatism (2008) p. 557 } An unreconstructed Southern conservative, he began his political career in the Democratic Party in the days when many white Southern politicians championed racial segregation. He moved to the Republican party in the 1970s. Helms was the most stridently conservative politician of the post 1960 era, { Bruce Frohnen, American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia (2006) p. 379 } especially in opposition to federal intervention into what he considered state affairs ( integration, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act ). Helms tried, with a 16-day filibuster, to stop the Senate from approving a federal holiday to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. Helms was credited even by his most vociferous opponents with providing excellent constituent services through his Senate office. { Link (2008) p 261 } As long-time chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he demanded a staunchly anti-communist foreign policy that would reward America&apos;s friends abroad, and punish its enemies. His relations with the State Department were often acrimonious, and he blocked numerous presidential appointees. However, he worked smoothly with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. { Link (2008) p 444–45 } In domestic affairs, Helms promoted industrial development in the South, seeking low taxes and few labor unions so as to attract northern and international corporations to relocate to North Carolina. On social issues, Helms was a traditionalist. He was a &quot; master obstructionist &quot; who relished his nickname, &quot; Senator No &quot;. { Congressional Quarterly, Politics in America 1992: The 102 Congress (1991) p 927 } He opposed, at various times, civil rights, disability rights, feminism, gay rights, affirmative action, abortion, and government support for contemporary art with graphic sexuality. { Link (2008) } Helms brought an &quot; aggressiveness &quot; { William D. Snider, Helms and Hunt: the North Carolina Senate race, 1984 (1985) p 19 } to his conservatism, as in his rhetoric against homosexuality, and employed racially charged language in his campaigns and editorials. { Link (2008) pp 39, 50, 196, 284, 373 } He combined cultural, social and economic conservatism which often helped his legislation win overwhelming support. The Almanac of American Politics once wrote that &quot; no American politician is more controversial, beloved in some quarters and hated in others, than Jesse Helms &quot;. { http://www.unctv.org/senatorno/film/index.html } [ Childhood and education (1921–1940) ] Helms was born in Monroe, North Carolina, where his father, nicknamed &quot; Big Jesse &quot;, served as both fire chief and chief of police; his mother, Ethel Mae Helms, was a homemaker. Helms was of English and Scots-Irish ancestry. { Link (2008) ch 1 } Helms briefly attended Wingate Junior College, now Wingate University, near Monroe, before leaving for Wake Forest College. He dropped out after a year to begin a career as a journalist, working for the next 11 years as a newspaper and radio reporter, first as a sportswriter and news reporter for The News &amp; Observer, and also as assistant city editor and city editor for The Raleigh Times. Helms met Dorothy &quot; Dot &quot; Coble, editor of the society page at The News &amp; Observer, and they married in 1942. Helms first interest in politics came from conversations with his father-in-law, who was a conservative. [ Early career (1940–1972) ] Helms&apos;s first full-time job after college was as a sports reporter with The Raleigh Times.

July 4, 2008 The New York Times July 4, 2008 ] During World War II, Helms served stateside as a recruiter in the United States Navy. In 1945, his first child, Jane, was born. After the war, he pursued his twin interests of journalism and Democratic party politics. Helms became the city news editor of The Raleigh Times, and later became a radio and television newscaster and commentator with a large statewide audience. [ Entry into politics ] In 1950, Helms played a critical role as campaign publicity director for Willis Smith in the U.S. Senate campaign against a prominent liberal Frank Porter Graham.

Smith won and hired Helms to be his administrative assistant in Washington. In 1952, Helms worked on the presidential campaign of Georgia Senator Richard Russell. After Russell dropped out of the presidential race, Helms returned to working for Smith. When Smith died in 1953, Helms returned to Raleigh and, from 1953 to 1960, was executive director of the North Carolina Bankers Association. He set up a home on Caswell Street in the Hayes Barton Historic District, where he lived until he died.

In 1960, Helms worked on the unsuccessful primary gubernatorial campaign of I. Beverly Lake, Sr., who ran on a platform of racial segregation.

Aaron decision insisting on the dismantling of segregated school systems, and that, combined with the lunch-counter demonstrations in Greensboro, compelled him to run. Lake lost to Terry Sanford, who ran as a racial moderate willing to implement the federal policy of school integration. Helms felt forced busing and forced racial integration caused animosity on both sides and &quot; proved to be unwise &quot;. [ Capitol Broadcasting Company ] In 1960, Helms joined the Raleigh-based Capitol Broadcasting Company (CBC) as the executive vice-president, vice chairman of the board, and assistant chief executive officer. His daily CBC editorials on WRAL-TV, given at the end of each night&apos;s local news broadcast in Raleigh, made Helms famous as a conservative commentator throughout eastern North Carolina. Helms&apos;s editorials featured folksy anecdotes interwoven with conservative views against, amongst others, &quot; the civil rights movement, the liberal news media, and anti-war churches &quot;. He referred to The News and Observer, his former employer, as the &quot; Nuisance and Disturber &quot; for its promotion of liberal views and support for civil rights activity.

He referred to the university as &quot; The University of Negroes and Communists &quot;, and suggested a wall be erected around the campus to prevent the university&apos;s liberal views from &quot; infecting &quot; the rest of the state. Helms said the civil rights movement was infested by communists and &quot; moral degenerates &quot;, and described Medicaid as a &quot; step over into the swampy field of socialized medicine &quot;. On the 1963 civil rights protests, Helms stated, &quot; The negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint that&apos;s thus far left him free to clog the streets, disrupt traffic, and interfere with other men&apos;s rights. &quot; [ http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec%3Dhealth%26amp%3Bres%3D9A0CE6DB1031F935A1575BC0A9679C8B63%26amp%3Bpartner%3Drssnyt%26amp%3Bemc%3Drss Ideas &amp; Trends; The Quotations of Chairman Helms: Race, God, AIDS and More Kevin Sack August 26, 2001 New York Times August 29, 2008 ] He later wrote, &quot; Crime rates and irresponsibility among negroes are a fact of life which must be faced &quot;.

While Galifianakis avoided mention of his party&apos;s presidential candidate, the liberal George McGovern, [ Marjorie Hunter Major Races in North Carolina Seem Close The New York Times October 28, 1972 14 July 9, 2009 ] Helms employed the slogans &quot; McGovernGalifianakis – one and the same &quot;, &quot; Vote for Jesse. Nixon Needs Him &quot; and &quot; Jesse: He&apos;s One of Us &quot;, an implicit play on his opponent&apos;s Greek heritage. Helms won the support of a large number of Democrats, especially in the conservative eastern part of the state. Galifianakis, for his part, attempted to woo Republicans by pointing to Helms&apos;s earlier criticism of Nixon as being too left-wing. [ Warren Weaver Democrats Gain 2 Seats and have 57–43 Majority The New York Times November 9, 1972 25 July 9, 2009 ] In a taste of things to come, money poured into the race. Helms spent a record $654,000, [ North Carolina; It&apos;ll be a yes for Senator No The Economist February 11, 1978 42 July 9, 2009 ] much of it going toward carefully crafted television commercials portraying the candidate as a soft-spoken mainstream conservative. In the final six weeks of the campaign Helms outspent Galifianakis three-to-one. Though the year was marked by Democratic gains in the Senate, Helms won 54 percent of the vote to Galifianakis&apos;s 46 percent and became the first Republican senator from the state since 1903: before senators were directly elected.

In 1974, in the wake of Roe v. Wade, Helms introduced a constitutional amendment that would have prohibited abortion in all circumstances, [ Linda Charlton Forces Against Abortion Assemble, With Optimism The New York Times June 2, 1974 C13 July 9, 2009 ] by conferring due process rights upon every fetus. [ Anti-Abortion Drive Suffers a Setback The New York Times October 9, 1974 22 July 9, 2009 ] However, the Senate hearing into the proposed amendments heard that neither Helms&apos;s, nor James L. Buckley &apos;s similar amendment, would achieve their stated goal, shelving them for the session. However, both Helms and Buckley proposed amendments again in 1975, with Helms&apos;s allowing states leeway in their implementation of an enshrined constitutional &quot; right to life &quot; from the &quot; moment of fertilization &quot;. [ Constitutional Ban on Abortion Urged The New York Times March 11, 1975 10 July 9, 2009 ] Helms was also prominent as a champion of free enterprise, and favored cutting the budget.

[ Patrick Cosgrave The arms report Congress tried to suppress The Times 16 June 21, 1978 July 13, 2009 ] Helms was not originally a supporter of Israel, proposing in 1973 a resolution demanding Israel return the West Bank to Jordan, and, in 1975, demanding that the Palestinian Arabs receive a &quot; just settlement of their grievances &quot;. { Link (2007), p. 318 } In 1977, Helms was the sole senator to vote against prohibiting American companies from joining the Arab League boycott of Israel, [ US Senate votes for anti-boycott Bill The Times 4 May 7, 1977 July 13, 2009 ] although this was primarily because the bill also relaxed discrimination against communist countries. [ Arab boycott; Morality with a loophole The Economist 47 May 14, 1977 July 13, 2009 ] In 1982, Helms even called for the U.S. to break diplomatic relations with Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War. [ It gets less easy to support Israel The Economist 35 August 14, 1982 July 13, 2009 ] He favored prohibiting foreign aid to countries that had recently detonated nuclear weapons: aimed squarely at India, but also affecting Israel should it conduct a nuclear test.

[ 1976 presidential election ] [ United States presidential election, 1976 ] Helms supported Ronald Reagan for the presidential nomination in 1976, even before Reagan had announced his candidacy, { Shirley (2005), p. 23 } and his contribution was crucial in the North Carolina primary victory that paved the way for Reagan&apos;s presidential election in 1980. The support of Helms, alongside Raleigh-based campaign operative Tom Ellis, was instrumental in Reagan winning the North Carolina primary and later presenting a major challenge to incumbent President Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention. According to author Craig Shirley, the two men deserve credit &quot; for breathing life into the dying Reagan campaign &quot;. { Shirley (2005), p. 160 } Going into the primary, Reagan had lost all the primaries, including in New Hampshire, where he had been favored, and was two million dollars in debt, with a growing number of Republican leaders calling for his exit. { Shirley (2005), p. 176 } The Ford campaign was predicting a victory in North Carolina, but assessed Reagan&apos;s strength in the state simply: Helms&apos;s support. { Shirley (2005), p. 61 } Whilst Ford had the backing of Governor James Holshouser, [ Fred Emery Do-or-die for the two main challengers in fickle North Carolina The Times 8 March 14, 1976 July 13, 2009 ] the grassroots movement formed in North Carolina by Ellis and backed by Helms delivered an upset victory by 53% to 47%. { Shirley (2005), p. 175 } The momentum generated in North Carolina carried Ronald Reagan to landslide primary wins in Texas, California, and other critical states, evening the contest between Reagan and Ford, and thus forcing undeclared delegates to choose at the 1976 convention. Later, Helms was not pleased by the announcement that Reagan would ask the 1976 Republican National Convention to, if nominated, make moderate Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker his running mate for the general election, [ Fred Emery Choice of liberal outrages some of Mr Reagan&apos;s supporters The Times 6 July 28, 1976 July 13, 2009 ] but kept his objections to himself at the time. { Shirley (2005), p. 275 } According to Helms, after being told by Ronald Reagan of the decision, he noted the hour because, &quot; I wanted to record for posterity the exact time I received the shock of my life. &quot; Helms and Strom Thurmond tried to make Reagan drop Schweiker for a conservative, perhaps either James Buckley [ Tom Wicker Tom Wicker The Paradox in Kansas City The New York Times August 13, 1976 18 July 9, 2009 ] or his brother William F. Buckley, and rumors surfaced that Helms might run for Vice-President himself, { Shirley (2005), p. 311 } but Schweiker remained. In the end, Reagan lost narrowly to Ford, whilst Helms received only token support at the Convention for the Vice-Presidential nomination, albeit enough to place him second, far behind Ford&apos;s choice of Bob Dole. Nonetheless, the platform adopted was a broadly conservative one, and the conservative faction came out acting like the winners; except Jesse Helms. [ Anthony Lewis Anthony Lewis Aground on a Rock The New York Times August 19, 1976 35 July 9, 2009 ] Helms vowed to campaign actively for Ford across the South, regarding the conservative platform adopted at the Convention to be a &quot; mandate &quot; on which Ford was pledging to run. However, he did target Henry Kissinger, demanding that he embrace the platform or resign immediately, after Kissinger issued a statement calling Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn a &quot; threat to world peace &quot;. [ Helms Calls for Kissinger to Back Platform or Quit The New York Times September 9, 1976 32 July 9, 2009 ] Helms continued to back Reagan, and the two remained close friends and political allies, although not uncritical ones, throughout Reagan&apos;s political career.

This victory enabled Reagan to contest the 1976 Republican Presidential nomination, and later to win the next nomination at the 1980 Republican National Convention and ultimately the Presidency of the United States. According to Craig Shirley, Had Reagan lost North Carolina, despite his public pronouncements, his revolutionary challenge to Ford, along with his political career, would have ended unceremoniously. He would have made a gracious exit speech, cut a deal with the Ford forces to eliminate his campaign debt, made a minor speech at the Kansas City Convention later that year, and returned to his ranch in Santa Barbara. He would probably have only reemerged to make speeches and cut radio commercials to supplement his income. And Reagan would have faded into political oblivion. [ Torrijos–Carter Treaties ] [ Torrijos–Carter Treaties ] Helms was a long-time opponent of transferring possession of the Panama Canal to Panama, calling its construction an &quot; historic American achievement &quot;, { Link (2008), p. 188 } and warned that it would fall into the hands of Omar Torrijos &apos;s &quot; communist friends &quot;. It had appeared as an issue in the 1976 presidential race, wherein then-President Ford suspended negotiations over the transfer of sovereignty to assuage conservative opposition. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter reopened negotiations, appointing Sol Linowitz as co-negotiator without Senate confirmation, and Helms and Strom Thurmond led the opposition to it. [ James Reston James Reston Carter, Panama, and China The New York Times August 24, 1977 19 July 9, 2009 ] Helms claimed that Linowitz&apos;s involvement with Marine Midland constituted a conflict of interests, arguing that it constituted a bailout of American banking interests, [ Hastedt Glenn P.

Helms also rallied Reagan, telling him that negotiation over Panama would be a &quot; second Schweiker &quot; as far as his conservative base was concerned. When Carter announced, on August 10, 1977, the conclusion of the treaties, Helms declared it a constitutional crisis, cited the need for the support of America&apos;s allies in Latin America, accused the U.S. of submitting to Panamanian blackmail, and complained that it threatened national security in the event of war in Europe. Helms threatened to obstruct Senate business, proposing two hundred amendments to the revision of the United States criminal code, knowing that most Americans opposed the treaties and would punish congressmen that voted for them if the ratification vote came in the run-up to the election. Helms announced the results of an opinion poll showing 78% public opposition, [ Hedrick Smith Hedrick Smith White House Opens Drive to Win Senate Approval of Canal Accord The New York Times August 12, 1977 1 July 9, 2009 ] but Helms and Thurmond&apos;s leadership of the cause made it politically easier for Carter, causing them to be replaced by the soft-spoken Paul Laxalt.

Wade. { Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books.

Helms introduced legislation that demanded immediate lifting of the sanctions; [ Graham Hovey Carter Promises to Stop Sanctions After Rhodesia Political Settlement The New York Times December 4, 1979 20 July 9, 2009 ] as negotiations progressed, Helms complied more with the administration&apos;s line, although Ted Kennedy accused Carter of conceding the construction of a new aircraft carrier in return for Helms&apos;s acquiescence on Zimbabwe Rhodesia, which both parties denied.

However, he did score a notable coup two years later, when he led a small group of conservatives to block the nomination of Robert T. Grey for nine months, [ Nicholas Ashford US diehards endanger arms talks The Times 6 January 6, 1983 July 13, 2009 ] and thus causing the firing of Eugene Rostow.

[ Peter Ross Range Thunder from the Right The New York Times February 8, 1981 SM6 July 9, 2009 ] At one point, he proposed a 40% cut in their funding. [ Jean Mayer Jean Mayer Schlossberg, Kenneth Tighten Food Stamps, But Don&apos;t Deprive the Needy The New York Times February 7, 1981 21 July 9, 2009 ] Instead, Helms supported the replacement of food stamps with workfare. [ Steven V. Robert Steven V. Roberts Testing &apos;Workfare&apos; in South Carolina: Food Stamp Users Find Mixed Results The New York Times April 20, 1981 16 July 9, 2009 ] He then proposed that food stamp benefits be dropped by $11.50 per month per child for each youngster enrolled in the school lunch program. He maintained that &quot; free lunches &quot; duplicate food stamps. The outcry against his proposal was so strong that he was compelled to back down. { Billy Hathorn, &quot; The Iron Triangle in Action: The Federal Food Stamp Program &quot;, National Social Science Journal Vol. 12, No. 2, 1999, p. 53 } Helms also challenged fraud in the food stamp program. He said that the public had &quot; grown legitimately resentful about the abuses which they themselves have observed &quot;. { Ernest B. Furgurson, Hard Right: The Rise of Jesse Helms (New York: W.W. Norton, 1986), pp. 152–153 } As a freshman lawmaker in 1973, Helms tried to reverse the 1968 congressional vote which had permitted workers on strike to qualify for food stamps. Though he failed to gain reversal, his position drew the support of future Minority and Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee and twelve Senate Democrats. Helms&apos; position was upheld in 1988, when the United States Supreme Court decreed 5–3 that a law denying food stamps to strikers was constitutional unless the worker otherwise qualified for food stamps prior to going on strike. Justice Byron White said that the government must maintain neutrality in labor dispute and not subsidize strikers. { The New York Times, March 24, 1988, p.1; Washington Post, March 24, 1988, p. A16 } As the Agriculture Committee chairman, Helms proposed repeal of the 1977 amendment which had deleted the purchase requirement for food stamps. With that position he ran afoul of fellow Republican Bob Dole, who claimed that the purchase requirement had contributed to fraud and administrative difficulties in the program. Helms cited a Congressional Budget Office report which showed that 75 percent of the increase in stamp usage had occurred since the purchase requirement was dropped. When Helms&apos; ally, Steve Symms of Idaho, proposed to reinstitute the purchase requirement, the motion was defeated, 33–66. { Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report, August 25, 1981, p. 726; June 13, 1981, p. 1033 } The Helms bloc also failed to secure other limits to the program, including a motion to delete alcohol and drug residential treatment patients from benefits. House and Senate conferees dropped a Helms-backed provision requiring families disqualified from the program to repay double the amount of any benefits received improperly. House Democratic Whip Thomas Foley of Washington insisted that such a penalty would violate the Fifth Amendment rights to due process. Instead families repay the actual amount of improperly obtained benefits. { Hathorn, National Social Science Journal, p. 54 } [ Economic policies ] Helms supported the gold standard through his role as the Agriculture Committee chairman, which exercises wide powers over commodity markets. During the budget crisis of 1981, Helms restored $200 million for school lunches by instead cutting foreign aid, [ Martin Tolchin $200 Million to Pay for School Lunches Restored by Senate The New York Times March 28, 1981 1 July 9, 2009 ] and against increases in grain and milk price support, [ Seth S.

He warned repeatedly against costly farm subsidies as chairman. [ Senate Farm Panel Votes More Subsidies The Wall Street Journal May 1, 1981 July 9, 2009 ] However, in 1983, he used his position to lobby to use the country&apos;s strategic dairy and wheat stocks to subsidize food exports as part of a trade war with the European Union.

[ Hedrick Smith Hedrick Smith Reagan&apos;s Sanctions The New York Times December 25, 1981 3 July 9, 2009 ] In 1982, Helms authored a bill to introduce a federal flat tax of 10% with a personal allowance of $2,000.

[ Patent Bill Splits the Drug Industry The New York Times August 15, 1982 NJ4 July 9, 2009 ] Helms continued to pose obstacles to Reagan&apos;s budget plans. At the end of the 97th Congress, Helms led a filibuster against Reagan&apos;s increase of federal gasoline tax by 5-cents per gallon: [ Helms: From Reagan Ally to Foe in One Filibuster The New York Times December 23, 1982 1 July 9, 2009 ] mirroring his opposition to Governor Jim Hunt &apos;s 3-cent increase in the North Carolina gasoline tax, but alienating the White House from Helms.

[ Hedrick Smith Hedrick Smith Senate Republicans Decide to Postpone &apos;Emotional&apos; Debates The New York Times March 27, 1981 1 July 9, 2009 ] With the new Congress, Helms and Robert K. Dornan again proposed an amendment banning abortion in all circumstances, [ Abortion Foes Meet With Reagan After March in Capital The New York Times January 23, 1981 14 July 9, 2009 ] and also proposed a bill defining fetuses as human beings, thereby taking it out of the hands of the federal courts, [ Courts in the dock The Economist June 19, 1982 65 July 9, 2009 ] along with Henry Hyde and Romano Mazzoli. [ Nadine Brozan Opposing Sides Step Up Efforts on Abortion Measure The New York Times February 15, 1981 14 July 9, 2009 ] More successfully, Helms passed an amendment banning federal funds from being used for abortion unless the woman&apos;s life is in danger.

[ Steven V. Roberst Steven V.

[ Furor Grows Over Bill to Curb Tax Break for Biased Schools The Wall Street Journal February 1, 1982 July 9, 2009 ] When the Voting Rights Act came up for amendment in 1982, Helms and Thurmond criticized it for bias against the South, arguing that it made Carolinians &quot; second-class citizens &quot; by treating their states differently, { Link (2007), p. 260 } and proposed an amendment that extended its terms to the whole country, which they knew would bury it.
