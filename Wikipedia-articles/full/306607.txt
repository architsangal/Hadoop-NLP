{ Thomas Neilson Paulin (born 25 January 1949, } { Leeds, England) is a } { Northern Irish poet and critic of film, music and literature. He lives in England, where he is the GM Young Lecturer in English Literature at } { Hertford College, Oxford. } [ Life and work ] While he was still young, Paulin&apos;s Northern Irish Protestant mother and English father moved from Leeds to Belfast and Paulin grew up in a middle class area of the city. According to Paulin, his parents, a doctor and headmaster, held &quot; vaguely socialist liberal views &quot;. While still a teenager, Paulin joined the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League. { &quot; Profile: Tom Paulin &quot;, } { The Guardian, 23 March 2002 } Paulin was educated at Annadale Grammar School, Hull University and Lincoln College, Oxford. From 1972 to 1994, he worked at the University of Nottingham, first as a lecturer and then as a Reader of Poetry. In 1977, he won the Somerset Maugham prize for his poetry collection A State of Justice and later established his reputation as a literary critic with work such as Minotaur: Poetry and the Nation State (1992). Recently he has championed the work of literary and social critic William Hazlitt and has taken part in a successful campaign to have Hazlitt&apos;s gravestone refurbished. Paulin is considered to be among a group of writers from a Unionist background &quot; who have attempted to recover the radical Protestant republican heritage of the eighteenth century to challenge orthodox concepts &quot; of Northern Irish Protestant identity. { Cleary, Joe, Literature, Partition and the Nation State: Culture and Conflict in Ireland, Israel and Palestine (Cambridge University Press, 2002), p.75 ISBN 0-521-65732-6 } Paulin is most widely-known in Britain for his appearances on the late-night BBC arts programmes The Late Show, Late Review and Newsnight Review, where he has established a reputation not only for his acerbic judgements but also for the unusual quality of some of his language (for instance, he once described the sound of Blur &apos;s 13 album as &quot; like barbed wire at the bottom of a pond &quot;. [ February 2007 ] ). He is also not averse to becoming involved in bad-tempered arguments with other regular guests such as Germaine Greer. His appearances on Newsnight Review were parodied on the Adam and Joe show&apos;s Toy Review. It featured a stuffed-toy tortoise with an Irish accent called Tom Tortoise, who strongly resembled Paulin. Following the success of the Field Day Theatre Company&apos;s tour of Brian Friel &apos;s play Translations in late 1980, the two founding directors (Brian Friel and Stephen Rea) decided to make Field Day a permanent enterprise; thus, to qualify for financial support from both the Northern Irish and the Irish governments, they expanded the governing board from the original two members to six: Brian Friel, Stephen Rea, Seamus Deane, Seamus Heaney, David Hammond, and Tom Paulin. In 2009 he translated Euripedes &apos;s Medea. { &quot; Tom Paulin - complete guide to the Playwright, Plays, Theatres, Agent &quot; doollee.com - The Playwrights Database } [ Controversy ] Paulin was the subject of controversy in 2001 and 2002 following the publication of his poem Killed in Crossfire in the British newspaper The Observer. { Killed in Crossfire The Onserver, 18 February 2001 } In the poem Paulin referred to the &apos;Zionist SS&apos;. Controversy following an interview he gave to the state-owned Egypt ian newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly, in which he told the newspaper that Brooklyn -born Jewish settlers &quot; should be shot dead &quot; and that &quot; they are Nazis, racists. I feel nothing but hatred for them &quot;. Paulin described what the Israeli government is doing in Palestine as &quot; an historical obscenity. &quot; When asked how he responds to accusations of anti-Semitism that follow such descriptions, he told the newspaper: &quot; I just laugh when they do that to me. It does not worry me at all. These are the Hampstead liberal Zionists. I have utter contempt for them. They use this card of anti-Semitism. They fill newspapers with hate letters. They are useless people. &quot; { &apos;That weasel word&apos; Al-Ahram Weekly Online, 4–10 April 2002 } Paulin considers his statements to be anti- Zionist; in the interview, Paulin said he “never believed that Israel had the right to exist at all.” Paulin has described himself as a lifelong opponent of anti-Semitism, and also stated that he does &quot; not support attacks on Israeli citizens under any circumstances. &quot; { Tom Paulin: Poetic polemicist BBC News, 15 November 2002 } In an interview with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, he was quoted as saying &quot; I can understand how suicide bombers feel. It is an expression of deep injustice and tragedy &quot;, and in the Jerusalem Post that &quot; It is better to resort to conventional guerrilla warfare. I think that attacks on civilians in fact boost morale. Hitler bombed London into submission, but in fact it created a sense of national solidarity. &quot; { The Jerusalem Post, 14 November 2002 } The interview resulted in the cancellation and subsequent reinstatement of Paulin&apos;s invitation to deliver the Morris Gray Lecture at Harvard University. { Tom Gross Welcome Voice?
