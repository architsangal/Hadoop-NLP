Historically they have spoken the dialect of German known as Pennsylvania Dutch or Pennsylvania German. The first major emigration of Germans to America resulted in the founding of the Borough of Germantown in northwest Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania on October 6, 1683. [ http://www.germanheritage.com/postal/germansettlers/ First German-Americans 2006-10-05 ] Mass emigration of Palatines began out of Germany in the early 18th century. The Pennsylvania Dutch maintained numerous religious affiliations, with the greatest number being Lutheran or Reformed, but many Anabaptist s as well. The Anabaptist religions promoted a simple lifestyle and their adherents were known as Plain people or Plain Dutch, as opposed to the Fancy Dutch who tended to assimilate more easily into the American mainstream. Over time, the various dialects spoken by these immigrants fused into a unique dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch or Pennsylvania German. At one time, over a third of Pennsylvania&apos;s population spoke this language, which also had an impact on the local dialect of English. After the Second World War, use of Pennsylvania German died out in favor of English, except among the more insular and tradition-bound Anabaptists, such as the Old Order Mennonite and Old Order Amish. However, a number of German cultural practices continue to this day, and German-Americans remain the largest ancestry group in Pennsylvania.

(1993), Amish Society, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, p. 241. } { De Grauwe, Luc, &quot; Emerging Mother-tongues Awareness in Dutch and German &quot;. In Linn &amp; McLelland (eds). Standardization: Studies from the Germanic Languages. p.101, 104, passim. } Etymologically, the word Dutch originates from the Old High German word &quot; diutisc &quot; (from &quot; diot &quot; &quot; people &quot; ), referring to the Germanic &quot; language of the people &quot; as opposed to Latin, the language of the learned (see also theodiscus ). Only later did the word come to refer to the people who spoke the language. { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch retrieved Nov. 3, 2011 citing to Paul, Hermann. 1960. Deutsches Wörterbuch (siebente Auflage): &quot; Deutsch &quot; } Other Germanic language variants for &quot; deutsch/deitsch/dutch &quot; are: Dutch &quot; Duits &quot;, Yiddish &quot; daytsh &quot;, Danish &quot; tysk &quot;, Norwegian &quot; tysk &quot;, and Swedish &quot; tyska &quot;. { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodiscus retrieved Nov. 3, 2011 } The English term &quot; Germans &quot; is only attested from the mid-16th century, based on the classical Latin term &quot; Germani &quot; used by Julius Caesar and later, Tacitus. It gradually replaced the terms &quot; Dutch &quot; and &quot; Almains &quot;, the latter becoming mostly obsolete by the early 18th century. The 17th and 18th century British and Anglo-American literature commonly drew a distinction between &quot; High Dutch &quot; —referring to the German language or to German-speakers from the Holy Roman Empire—and the &quot; Low Dutch &quot; —referring to the Dutch language of the Netherlands. { http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans retrieved Nov. 3, 2011, citing to ^ Schulze, Hagen (1998).

Therefore, despite urban legend to the contrary, the term Pennsylvania Dutch is not so much a misnomer as it is an anachronism. [ Geography ] The Pennsylvania Dutch live primarily in Southeastern and South Central Pennsylvania in the area stretching in an arc from Bethlehem and Allentown through Reading, Lebanon, and Lancaster to York and Chambersburg. They can also be found down throughout the Shenandoah Valley (the modern Interstate 81 corridor) in the adjacent states of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina, and in the large Amish and Mennonite communities in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, in Ohio north and south of Youngstown and in Indiana around Elkhart. [ Pennsylvania Dutch from the Palatinate of the Rhine ] Many Pennsylvania Dutch are descendants of refugees from the Palatinate of the German Rhine. For example, some Amish and Mennonite s came to the Palatinate and surrounding areas from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, where, as Anabaptists, they were persecuted, and so their stay in the Palatinate was of limited duration. { Newman, George F., Newman, Dieter E. (2003) The Aebi-Eby Families of Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and North America, 1550-1850. Pennsylvania: NMN Enterprises } However, for the majority of the Pennsylvania Dutch, their roots go much further back in the Palatinate. During the War of the Grand Alliance (1689–97), French troops pillaged the Palatinate, forcing many Germans to flee. The War of the Palatinate (as it was called in Germany), also called the &quot; War of Augsburg &quot;, began in 1688 as Louis took claim of the Palatinate, and all major cities of Cologne were devastated. By 1697 the war came to a close with the Treaty of Ryswick, now Rijswijk in the Netherlands, and the Palatinate remained free of French control. However, by 1702, the War of Spanish Succession began, lasting until 1713. French expansionism forced many Palatines to flee as refugees. { Roeber 1988 } [ Migration and settlement ] The first major emigration of Germans to America resulted in the founding of the Borough of Germantown in northwest Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania on October 6, 1683 by a group of settlers organized by Francis Daniel Pastorius, an agent for a land purchasing company based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and was composed largely of Quakers and Mennonites from the Rhineland. Mass emigration of Palatines began out of Germany in the early 18th century. In the spring of 1709, Queen Anne granted refuge to about 7,000 Palatines who had sailed the Rhine to Rotterdam. From there, about 3,000 were sent to America either directly or through England, bound for William Penn &apos;s colony. The remaining refugees were sent to Ireland to strengthen the Protestant presence in that country. By 1710, large groups of Palatines had sailed from London, the last group of which was bound for New York. There were 3,200 Palatines on 12 ships that sailed for New York and approximately 470 died en route to America. In New York, under the new Governor, Robert Hunter, Palatines lived in camps and worked for British authorities to produce tar and pitch for the Royal Navy in return for their safe passage. They also served as a buffer on the frontier separating the French and Native Americans from the English colonies. In 1723, some 33 Palatine families, dissatisfied under Governor Hunter&apos;s rule, migrated from Schoharie, New York, along the Susquehanna River to Tulpehocken, Berks County, Pennsylvania, where other Palatines had settled. They became farmers and used intensive German farming techniques that proved highly productive. { Farley Grubb, &quot; German Immigration to Pennsylvania, 1709 to 1820, &quot; Journal of Interdisciplinary History Vol. 20, No. 3 (Winter, 1990), pp. 417-436 in JSTOR } 450px Pictures from Old-Germantown. Shown here is the first log cabin of Pastorius about 1683, Pastorius&apos; later house about 1715, print shop and house of Saurs about 1735, and the market square about 1820. [ 18th century ] The Pennsylvania Dutch composed nearly half the population of Pennsylvania and generally supported the American Revolution. Henry Miller, an immigrant from Germany of Swiss ancestry, published an early German translation of the Declaration of Independence in his newspaper Philadelphische Staatsbote. Miller often wrote about Swiss history and myth, such as the William Tell legend, to provide a context for patriot support in the conflict with Britain. { A. G.. Roeber, &quot; Henry Miller&apos;s Staatsbote: A Revolutionary Journalist&apos;s Use of the Swiss Past, &quot; Yearbook of German-American Studies, 1990, Vol. 25, pp 57-76 } Frederick Muhlenberg (1750–1801), a Lutheran pastor, became a major patriot and politician, rising to Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. [ Religion ] The Pennsylvania Dutch are a people of various religious affiliations, most of them Lutheran or Reformed, but many Anabaptists as well. Henry Muhlenberg (1711–1787) founded the Lutheran Church in America. He organized the Ministerium of Pennsylvania in 1748, set out the a standard organizational format for new churches, and helped shape Lutheran liturgy. { Leonard R. Riforgiato, Missionary of moderation: Henry Melchior Muhlenberg and the Lutheran Church in America (1980) } Muhlenberg had been sent by the Lutheran bishops in Germany and he always insisted on strict conformity to Lutheran dogma. Muhlenberg&apos;s view of church unity was in direct opposition to Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf &apos;s Moravian approach with its goal of uniting various Pennsylvania German religious groups under a less rigid &quot; Congregation of God in the Spirit. &quot; The differences between the two approaches led to permanent impasse between Lutherans and Moravians, especially after a December 1742 meeting in Philadelphia. { Samuel R. Zeiser, &quot; Moravians and Lutherans: Getting beyond the Zinzendorf-Muhlenberg Impasse, &quot; Transactions of the Moravian Historical Society, 1994, Vol. 28, pp 15-29 } [ See also ] [ United States Germany ] Amish Mennonite Schwenkfeldian Old German Baptist Brethren Pennsylvania German language Hex sign Pennsylvania Dutch Country Hiwwe wie Driwwe. newspaper Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine German American Helen Reimensnyder Martin, author Anna Balmer Myers, author Fraktur (Pennsylvania German folk art) Kurrent handwriting [ pdc ] [ References ] [ Bibliography ] Grubb, Farley. &quot; German Immigration to Pennsylvania, 1709 to 1820, &quot; Journal of Interdisciplinary History Vol. 20, No. 3 (Winter, 1990), pp.  417–436 in JSTOR McMurry, Sally, and Nancy Van Dolsen, eds.
