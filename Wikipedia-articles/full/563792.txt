Based on Canvey Island in the estuary of the Thames, their ground Park Lane is a few feet below sea level. Frank Saul, an FA Cup winner with Spurs, and several other players with league experience, have played for the club. They share a healthy rivalry with fellow islanders, Concord Rangers, who they will play in the 2010/11 season in the Isthmian League Premier Division. [ History ] Football has been played on the Island since Victorian times, with several precursors to the current team folding. Canvey Island F.C. were formed in 1926 but had not achieved major success prior to the early 1990s. The early records of the club were destroyed in a major flood during 1953, their loss referenced in the song &quot; Canvey Island &quot; on the album Do You Like Rock Music? by the group British Sea Power. The club had floated around the regional amateur leagues in Essex for that time. Former player Jeff King became both manager and owner of the then Essex Senior League side in 1992 and has led the club through four promotions in the football pyramid, reaching the Conference after a 2003/04 season that saw them win the Isthmian League by 19 points – winning the title with seven games to spare.Canvey have produced several notable footballers including Frank Saul and Dean Marney (formerly of Tottenham Hotspur ). At the end of the 2005/06 season, however, owner-manager Jeff King announced that he was no longer willing to fund the club any longer and left to join Isthmian League Premier Division side Chelmsford City. This left the club in financial difficulties, and as a result of which Canvey voluntarily resigned from the Football Conference, dropping three divisions to join the Isthmian League First Division North in 2006/07. Long-serving reserves and youth team manager, John Batch, assisted by former player Garry Britnell, took over at the club following King&apos;s departure and began to re-build the club following the departure of the entire first team-squad. In January 2008, the club had 4 of their players called up to play in the 2010 World Cup Qualifiers and International Friendlies. Midfielders Ryan Edgar and Danny Francis were called up for Caribbean country Dominica to face Barbados, with defender Chris Bourne and midfielder Clydie Roberts being selected for the Guyana squad to face Cuba. Canvey will play in the Isthmian League Premier Division in the 2008–09 season after winning the playoffs. They finished 5th in the league, beat AFC Sudbury in the semi-final and beat Redbridge on penalties in the final. Manager John Batch decided to stand down [ http://www.isthmian.non-league-chat.com/john-batch-stands-down-as-cavney-island-manager/ John Batch Stands Down Non League Chat 06 January 2012 ] from his position as Canvey Island`s first-team manager on 06th January 2012. After his business interests increasingly took up more of his time. Glen Alzapiedi who was the clubs first-team coach replaced him as Manager. [ Cup competitions ] Canvey&apos;s most significant cup success came in 2001 when they defeated Forest Green Rovers 1–0 after a 14th minute goal by captain Ben Chenery in the final of the FA Trophy, the leading cup competition in England for clubs outside of the four top leagues- at Aston Villa &apos;s Villa Park stadium in front of a crowd of 10,007. Canvey Island gained further recognition through FA Cup runs, notably in 2001–02 when they knocked out Northampton Town and current Premiership side Wigan Athletic en route to the third round proper of the competition. This gained much publicity for the club and featured on such programmes as the BBC&apos;s Match of the Day, and Sky Sports. [ Stadium ] Canvey Island play at their home matches at Park Lane, named because of the road on which it resides. The ground has a capacity of &quot; over 4,500 &quot; [ http://canveyislandfc.com/club/stadium The Brockwell Stadium Canvey Island website 20 December 2010 ] and the stadium has reached its capacity on one occasion, when the team faced Northampton Town in the FA Cup in 2001.
