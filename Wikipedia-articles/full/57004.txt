[ September 2011 ] [ September 2011 ] { Tuvalu } [ Tuvalu ] Tuvalu is a Polynesia n island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia. [ http://www.tuvaluislands.com/maps/maps.html Maps of Tuvalu ] The economy of Tuvalu is constrained by its remoteness and lack of economies of scale. Government revenues largely come from the lease of its highly fortuitous.tv Top Level Domain (TLD); sales of stamp s and coin s; fishing licenses (primarily paid under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty); [ http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/IFD/ifd_sptt.html South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT) 1988 2010-09-01 ] direct grants from international donors (government donors as well as from the Asian Development Bank ); and income from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (established in 1987 by the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand ).

There is no apparent large income disparity among the residents, although virtually the only jobs in the islands that pay a steady wage or salary are with the government, which make up about two thirds of those in formal employment. About 15% of adult males work as seamen on foreign flagged merchant ships. [ https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tv.html The World Factbook (CIA) 1 Sept. 2011 ] Population growth on the outer islands, the limits as to available land and the lack of employment opportunities, results in a flow of people from the outer islands to the capital in Funafuti with further pressure to migrate to Australia or New Zealand. There is high youth unemployment and few new jobs being created. Given the absence of natural resources (apart from tuna in the territorial waters), and the constrains imposed on the Tuvaluan economy by its remoteness and lack of economies of scale, practical policies are needed for improvements to the livelihoods of the growing numbers of young Tuvaluans who aspire to a more affluent lifestyle than older generations. Tuvalu comprises four reef islands and five true atoll s that result in a contiguous zone: [ 24 nmi km 0 on ] exclusive economic zone: [ 200 nmi km -1 on ] territorial sea: [ 12 nmi km 0 on ] Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. The population of 10,472 makes Tuvalu the third-least populous sovereign state in the world; as compared to its immediate neighbours, it has a larger population than Nauru, but is smaller than Kiribati which has a permanent population of just over 100,000 (2011).

Tuvalu is considered a safe country of unspoiled natural beauty and friendly people. However, due to its remoteness, the cost of travelling to the island and limited air traffic to the country, limited numbers of tourists visit each year. The majority of visitors to Tuvalu are government officials, aid workers, NGO officials or consultants. [ SBS World Guide, Sixteenth Edition 2008 Hardie Grant Australia 978-1-74066-648-0 747 ] [ Island economy ] Tuvaluans are primarily involved in traditional agriculture and fishing. About 500 Tuvalu men are employed abroad at any given time as sailors, primarily on German -owned ships. Another 300 sailors are in Tuvalu on leave between rigorous, 12-plus-month cruises. Remittances from seafarers is a major source of income for families in the country. In 2002, the Asian Development Bank approved an assistance package to upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute which trains young Tuvaluans so they can work aboard foreign vessels. [ http://www.adb.org/countries/highlights/TUV.asp Asian Development Bank (Tuvalu) 2010-09-01 ] From 1996 to 2002, Tuvalu was one of the best performing Pacific Island economies and achieved an average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 5.6 per cent per annum. Since 2002 economic growth has slowed as Tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices fuel and food with the level of inflation peaking at 13.4% in 2008, [ http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Tuvalu.php New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) 2010-09-01 ] and falling to -1¾% in November 2010.

However due to the acute level of geographic, macroeconomic and financial isolation, scale of area, population infrastructure and agriculture, climate change, oil dependency, contracting GDP and economic dependency many sources in this decade view Tuvalu as an extremely vulnerable economy. [ TUVALU: ECONOMIC OVERVIEW AND MAJOR CHALLENGES http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/cdp/ldc/profile/plen4c_cdp2009.pdf UN 20 December 2011 ] World Bank Statistics outline that in 2010 Tuvalu produced a bottom-tier ranking Gross Domestic Product of $31,350,804 and Gross National Income of $4,760.

The value of these remittances was valued at A$4 million (est. 2006) and on average accounts for 10% of GDP. A UN Report makes reference to the fact that these revenue streams are vulnerable to macroeconomic change while the national budget remains heavily subsidised through international aid and funding schemes such as the The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) (value $77 million, 2006 est), with a strong reliance on the importation of food (imports $15.5 million 2007 est. [ Data, Tuvalu http://data.worldbank.org/country/tuvalu The World Bank 19 December 2011 ] The country is also imported-fuel dependent, with gas prices quoted at $12/gal (2009). Although listed by the UN as a Lower Middle Income LDC, it scores very high in terms of EVI (Economic Vulnerability Index), with a rating of 79.7 out of 100 in 2009, leading the UN to state that Tuvalu is the most &quot; economically vulnerable country in the world &quot;. Due to the factors addressed earlier, Tuvalu yields a limited revenue from exports.

[ NATIONAL FISHERY SECTOR OVERVIEW ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/DOCUMENT/fcp/en/FI_CP_TV.pdf Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 23 December 2011 ] The Tuvaluan economy therefore relies heavily on its fishing income, with 42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in Fishing activity at various levels. UN Data calculated a gross value of fisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of coastal commercial fishing, coastal subsistence fishing, locally based offshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and aquaculture. In recent years all of the income has been generated through the listed activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from Tuvalu. The activities of international fishing fleets, which in 2008 comprised 42 longline fishing vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 purse seiners, far outweigh domestic activity, with a production volume of 35,541 tonnes worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu retains a sizeable share in income via licensing. The fishing in the 900,000  km 2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna. The public sector enterprises are the National Bank of Tuvalu, Development Bank of Tuvalu, Tuvalu Electricity Corporation, Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation, National Fishing Company of Tuvalu, Philatelic Bureau, Tuvalu Marine Training Institute and Vaiaku Lagi Hotel. Tuvaluan radio services are operated by the Tuvalu Media Corporation. The Tuvalu National Provident Fund provides its members with loans, for which each member’s account is used as collateral. The Tuvalu Cooperative Society is the main wholesaler and retailer in Tuvalu.

The TTF, a prudently managed overseas investment fund, has contributed roughly 11% of the annual government budget each year since 1990. With a capital value of about 2.5 times GDP, the TTF provides an important cushion for Tuvalu&apos;s volatile income sources from fishing and royalties from the sale of the dot-TV domain. With an initial capital of about A$27 million at independence, it now totals about A$100 million.
