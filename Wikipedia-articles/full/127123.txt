The population was 604 at the 2000 census. The name is derived from a circular lake adjacent to the village. In 1975, the Round Lake Historic District, which encompasses the village, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Village of Round Lake is in the Town of Malta and is northeast of Schenectady. [ History ] The village began in 1867 as a summer camp meeting locale for groups of Methodist s. At first, visitors lived in tents, while visiting ministers could rent space in the second story of the meeting&apos;s passenger station. By 1868 more permanent structures including cottages, a two-story trustees office and bookstore, and a market appeared. Besides the expected religious meetings, a week was devoted to musical endeavors [never heard of this, not sure accuracy for &quot; music week]. It was owned and governed by the Round Lake Association and patterned after Chautauqua Institution. (no. Incorrect. The original grounds were a camp meeting that frequently featured the Troy Annual Conference Camp Meeting, the National Camp-Meeting Association for the Promotion of Holiness, and the New York State Camp Meeting. The grounds&apos; days as the Round Lake Assembly, which was modeled after the Chautauqua Institute, did not begin until the late 1870s/1880s). The 1980-pipe Ferris Tracker organ, originally built in 1847 for Calvary Episcopal Church in New York City, was moved to the Round Lake Auditorium in 1888 and is considered to be the oldest and largest three-manual organ in existence. { Dunn 1974 : 412 } The organ is still used for musical programs today. By mid 20th century, declining interest in the cultural activities of the Round Lake Association led to its demise in the 1960s. After the association was dissolved, the village was incorporated in 1969 to take its place.

Sherman Hose Company, with a Constitution that required active members have ‘good moral character’ and live within a mile of the community. The first firehouse was situated on Troy Avenue near the intersection of Burlington Avenue. A two wheeled cart carried two sizes of hose, which were rolled up on a wheel axle and had a long pole with enough handles for seven men to pull it along if necessary. Another two wheeled cart, with a bell mounted on the axle, would proceed ahead of the hoses to sound a warning. The modern Round Lake Hose Company operates two fire stations, housing a total of eight pieces of apparatus. The membership consists of 60 dedicated, volunteer men and women who continue to respond to emergencies in this quaint little village as well as within the town of Malta and town of Ballston. Additionally, a 1926 Childs fire truck which was purchased from the village of Ballston Spa in 1945 is maintained as a unique parade piece representing their history.
