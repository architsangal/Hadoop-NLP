Spinning glass disks (bowls) on a common shaft are arranged with the lower notes (larger disks) to the left and higher notes (smaller disks) to the right. The glass harmonica, also known as the glass armonica, bowl organ, hydrocrystalophone, or simply the armonica (derived from &quot; harmonia, &quot; the Greek word for harmony), is a type of musical instrument that uses a series of glass bowl s or goblets graduated in size to produce musical tone s by means of friction (instruments of this type are known as friction idiophone s ). Because its sounding portion is made of glass, the glass harmonica is a crystallophone. The phenomenon of rubbing a wet finger around the rim of a wine goblet to produce tones is documented back to Renaissance times; Galileo considered the phenomenon (in his Two New Sciences), as did Athanasius Kircher. The Irish musician Richard Poekrich is typically credited as the first to play an instrument composed of glass vessels by rubbing his fingers around the rims. [ Bloch Thomas http://www.finkenbeiner.com/gh.html http://www.thebakken.org/exhibits/mesmer/glass-armonica.htm 2007-05-22 http://web.archive.org/web/20070405115543/http%3A//www.thebakken.org/exhibits/mesmer/glass-armonica.htm April 5, 2007 ] Beginning in the 1740s, he performed in London on a set of upright goblets filled with varying amounts of water. During the same decade, Christoph Willibald Gluck also attracted attention playing a similar instrument in England. [ Names ] { Rome, Italy. The rims of } { wine glass es filled with water are rubbed by the player&apos;s fingers to create the notes. } The word &quot; glass harmonica &quot; (also glassharmonica, glass armonica, harmonica de verre or armonica de verre in French, glasharmonika in German) refers to any instrument played by rubbing glass or crystal goblets or bowls. When Benjamin Franklin invented his mechanical version of the instrument, he called it the armonica, based on the Italian word &quot; armonia, &quot; which means &quot; harmony. &quot; { The free reed wind instrument called the } { harmonica was not invented until 1821, sixty years later. } The instrument consisting of a set of wine glasses (usually tuned with water) is generally known in English as &quot; musical glasses &quot; or &quot; glass harp. &quot; The word hydrodaktulopsychicharmonica is also recorded, composed of Greek roots to mean something like &quot; harmonica to produce music for the soul by fingers dipped in water, &quot; (hydro- for &quot; water, &quot; daktul (daktyl) for &quot; finger, &quot; psych- for &quot; soul &quot; ) { Ian Crofton (2006) &quot; Brewer&apos;s Cabinet of Curiosities, &quot; ISBN 0-304-36801-6 } The Oxford Companion to Music mentions that this word is &quot; the longest section of the Greek language ever attached to any musical instrument, for a reader of The Times wrote to that paper in 1932 to say that in his youth he heard a performance of the instrument where it was called a hydrodaktulopsychicharmonica. &quot; { As quoted from the 1970 edition of the Companion by a Glasssharmonica.com webpage } The Museum of Music in Paris displays a hydrodaktulopsychicharmonica. { &quot; Museums celebrate spring &quot; } [ Franklin&apos;s armonica ] Benjamin Franklin invented a radically new arrangement of the glasses in 1761 after seeing water-filled wine glasses played by Edmund Delaval at Cambridge in England in 1758. { Downloadable Broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Adam Hart Davis on the &apos;&apos;Angelic Organ of Evil&apos;&apos; } Franklin, who called his invention the &quot; armonica &quot; after the Italian word for harmony, worked with London glassblower Charles James to build one, and it had its world premiere in early 1762, played by Marianne Davies. In Franklin&apos;s treadle-operated version, 37 bowls were mounted horizontally on an iron spindle. The whole spindle turned by means of a foot pedal. The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls with moistened fingers. Rims were painted different colors according to the pitch of the note. A&apos;s were dark blue, B&apos;s purple, C&apos;s red, D&apos;s orange, E&apos;s yellow, F&apos;s green, G&apos;s blue, and accidentals white. { The Writings of Benjamin Franklin, Volume III: London, 1757–1775 – Faults in Songs } With the Franklin design it is possible to play ten glasses simultaneously if desired, a technique that is very difficult if not impossible to execute using upright goblets. Franklin also advocated the use of a small amount of powdered chalk on the fingers, which helped produce a clear tone in the same way rosin does for the bows of string instruments. A modern glass armonica built using Benjamin Franklin&apos;s design Some attempted improvements on the armonica included adding keyboards, placing pads between the bowls to reduce vibration, [ Zeitler William The Music and the Magic of the Glass Armonica http://www.glassarmonica.com/armonica/history/waxes/germany.php 2007-05-22 – Scholar search http://web.archive.org/web/20070210220757/http%3A//www.glassarmonica.com/armonica/history/waxes/germany.php February 10, 2007 ] [ May 2009 ] and using violin bows. These variations never caught on because they did not sound as pleasant. Another supposed improvement was to have the glasses rotate into a trough of water. However, William Zeitler put this idea to the test by rotating an armonica cup into a basin of water: the water has the same effect as putting water in a wine glass – it changes the pitch. With several dozen glasses, each a different diameter and thus rotating with a different depth, the result would be musical cacophony. { See http://www.glassarmonica.com/armonica/history/franklin/WaterTrough.php, which includes a video demonstration. } It also made it much harder to make the glass speak, and muffled the sound. In 1975, an original armonica was acquired by the Bakken Museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota and put on display. It was purchased through a musical instrument dealer in France, from the descendants of Mme. Brillon de Jouy, a neighbor of Benjamin Franklin&apos;s from 1777 to 1785, when he lived in the Paris suburb of Passy. [ The Bakken Glass Armonica http://www.thebakken.org/exhibits/mesmer/glass-armonica.htm 2007-05-22 http://web.archive.org/web/20070405115543/http%3A//www.thebakken.org/exhibits/mesmer/glass-armonica.htm April 5, 2007 ] Some 18th and 19th century specimens of the armonica have survived into the 21st century. Franz Mesmer also played the armonica and used it as an integral part of his Mesmerism. An original Franklin armonica is in the archives at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is only placed on display for special occasions, such as Franklin&apos;s birthday. This is also the home of the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial. { The Franklin Institute – Exhibit – Franklin... He&apos;s Electric } [ Works ] Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, George Frideric Handel, Ludwig van Beethoven, Richard Strauss, and more than 100 other composers composed works for the glass harmonica; some pieces survived in the repertoire in transcriptions for more conventional instruments. Since it was rediscovered during the 1980s composers have written again for it (solo, chamber music, opera, electronic music, popular music) including Jan Erik Mikalsen, Regis Campo, Etienne Rolin, Philippe Sarde, Damon Albarn, Tom Waits, Michel Redolfi, Cyril Morin, Stefano Giannotti, Thomas Bloch, and Guillaume Connesson. [ Stars-GlassArmonica.ogg The Fixed Stars, the Frontier to the Beyond A song played almost entirely on a glass harmonica. Ogg ] European monarchs indulged in it, and even Marie Antoinette took lessons as a child from Marianne Davies. One of the best known myths about the instrument involves the &quot; Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy &quot; from the ballet The Nutcracker. Tchaikovsky &apos;s first draft called for glass harmonica – which used the name but was actually a kind of glass xylophone. He changed it to the newly-invented celesta (by Mustel, Paris) before the work&apos;s premiere performance in 1892. { Sterki, P. (2000); Klingende Gläser; Peter Lang; NY; ISBN 3-906764-60-5, p. 97 } Camille Saint-Saëns also used this percussive instrument in his The Carnival of the Animals (in movements 7 and 14). Gaetano Donizetti originally included it in Lucia di Lammermoor as a haunting accompaniment to the heroine&apos;s mad scenes, though before the premiere he rewrote the part for flute. [ The New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/arts/music/05glas.html October 5, 2007 Resonance Is a Glass Act for a Heroine on the Edge Anthony Tommasini Anthony Tommasini ] [ Purported dangers ] The instrument&apos;s popularity did not last far beyond the 18th century. Some claim this was due to strange rumors that using the instrument caused both musicians and their listeners to go mad. It is a matter of conjecture how pervasive that belief was; all the commonly cited examples of this rumor are German, if not confined to Vienna. One example of fear from playing the glass harmonica was noted by a German musicologist Friedrich Rochlitz in the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung : [ Cope Kevin L. 1650–1850: ideas, aesthetics, and inquiries in the early modern era http://books.google.com/books?id%3Djf7WAAAAMAAJ 5 April 2011 30 September 2004 AMS Press 978-0-404-64410-9 149 ] Marianne Kirchgessner was an armonica player; she died at the age of 39 of pneumonia or an illness much like it. { Bossler, Heinrich (1809-05-10). Marianne Kirchgessner obituary. Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung, 10 May 1809. Obituary written by Marianne Kirchgessner&apos;s manager } { Heinrich Bossler. } However, others, including Franklin, lived long lives. By 1820 the glass armonica had disappeared from public performance, perhaps because musical fashions were changing – music was moving out of the relatively small aristocratic halls of Mozart&apos;s day into the increasingly large concert halls of Beethoven and his successors, and the delicate sound of the armonica simply could not be heard. A modern version of the &quot; purported dangers &quot; claims that players suffered lead poisoning because armonicas were made of lead glass. However, there is no known scientific basis for the theory that merely touching lead glass can cause lead poisoning. Furthermore, many modern versions, such as those made by Finkenbeiner, are made from pure silica glass. { Glass harmonica at Finkenbeiner } Lead poisoning was common in the 18th and early 19th centuries for both armonica players and non-players alike: doctors prescribed lead compounds for a long list of ailments, and lead or lead oxide was used as a food preservative and in cookware and eating utensils. Trace amounts of lead that armonica players in Franklin&apos;s day received from their instruments would likely have been dwarfed by lead from other sources. { See Finger, Stanley (2006); Doctor Franklin&apos;s Medicine; U of Pennsylvania Press; Philadelphia; ISBN 0-8122-3913-X. Chapter 11, &quot; The Perils of Lead &quot; (p. 181–198) discusses the pervasiveness of lead poisoning in Franklin&apos;s day and Franklin&apos;s own leadership in combating it. } [ Perception of the armonica sound ] The somewhat disorienting quality of the ethereal sound is due in part to the way that humans perceive and locate ranges of sounds. Above 4,000 Hertz we primarily use the volume of the sound to differentiate between each ear (left and right) and thus triangulate, or locate, the source.Below 1,000 Hertz we use the &apos;phase differences&apos; of sound waves arriving at our ears to identify left and right for location. The predominant timbre of the armonica is in the range of 1,000–4,000 hertz, which coincides with the sound range where the brain is &apos;not quite sure&apos; and thus we have difficulty locating it in space (where it comes from), and referencing the source of the sound (the materials and techniques used to produce it). { Dr Nicky Gibbon, Sheffield Hallam University, on BBC Radio 4 – Angelic Organ of Evil } [ Modern revival ] Dennis James plays the Glass Harmonica at the Poncan Theatre in Ponca City, Oklahoma, on April 2, 2011. Music for glass harmonica and glass harp was all-but-unknown from 1820 (although Gaetano Donizetti intended for the aria “ Il dolce suono ” from his 1835 opera Lucia di Lammermoor to be accompanied by a glass harmonica) until the 1930s, when German virtuoso Bruno Hoffmann began revitalizing interest in the glass harp with his stunning performances. Playing a standard &quot; glass harp &quot; (with real wine glasses in a box), he mastered almost all of the literature written for the instrument, and commissioned contemporary composers to write new pieces for it. Franklin&apos;s glass armonica was re-invented by master glassblower and musician, Gerhard B. Finkenbeiner (1930–1999) in 1984. After thirty years of experimentation, Finkenbeiner&apos;s prototype consisted of clear glasses and glasses with gold bands. Those with gold bands indicate the equivalent of the black keys on the piano. Finkenbeiner Inc., of Waltham, Massachusetts, continues to produce these instruments commercially. French instrument makers and artists Bernard and François Baschet invented a variation of the glass harmonica in 1952, the crystal organ or Cristal baschet, which consists of 52 chromatically-tuned glass rods that are rubbed with wet fingers. The glass harmonica differs mainly in that the rods, set horizontally, attach to a heavy metal block that the vibration passes to via a metal stem. The crystal organ is a fully acoustic instrument, and amplification is obtained using fiberglass cones fixed on wood and by a tall cut out metal part in the shape of a flame. Metallic rods resembling cat whiskers are placed under the instrument to increase the sound power of high-pitched sounds. Dennis James recorded an album of all glass music, Cristal: Glass Music Through the Ages co-produced by Linda Ronstadt and Grammy Award-winning producer John Boylan. { Sony Classical Music. &quot; Cristal – Glass Music Through the Ages &quot; } James plays the glass armonica, the cristal and the seraphim on the CD in original historical compositions for glass by Mozart, Scarlatti, Schnaubelt, and Fauré and collaborates on the recording with the Emerson String Quartet, operatic soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, and Ronstadt. James played glass instruments on Marco Beltrami&apos;s film scores for The Minus Man (1999) and The Faculty (1998). &quot; I first became aware of glass instruments at about the age of 6 while visiting the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. I can still recall being mesmerized by the appearance of the original Benjamin Franklin armonica then on display in its own showcase in the entry rotunda of the city&apos;s famed science museum. &quot;. { &quot; Dennis James interview &quot; interviewed by Rich Bailey January, 2002 } [ Notable armonica players ] [ Historical ] An armonica Marie Antoinette Marianne Davies Benjamin Franklin (United States) Franz Mesmer Marianne Kirchgessner Mrs. Philip Thicknesse (born Anne Ford ), 1775, United Kingdom) [ Contemporary ] Thomas Bloch (France) Cecilia Brauer (United States) Glass Duo (Poland) Bill Hayes (New York City) Broadway Musician and Percussionist, Barbra Streisand Orchestra 1994, 2006, 2007 Martin Hilmer Glassmusic with verrophone and glassharp The Glassharmonica made by Sascha Reckert.

The hydraulophone sounds similar to a glass armonica but has a darker, heavier sound, that extends down into the subsonic range. The technique for playing hydraulophone is similar to that used for playing armonica.
