The team will compete in the Football League Championship for the first time in 11 seasons from the 2012–13 season. They were relegated from the Premier League, the top tier of English football, at the end of the 2011–12 season. The club was established in 1875, becoming a founding member of The Football League in 1888. It is one of only three clubs to have been both a founder member of the Football League and the Premier League (the others being Aston Villa and Everton ). In 1890 Rovers moved to its permanent home at Ewood Park. Prior to the formation of the Premier League in 1992, most of the club&apos;s successes were before 1930, when it had gained league and FA Cup trophies on several occasions. Relegation in 1966 was followed by 26 successive seasons of football outside the top flight. In 1992, Blackburn was promoted to the new Premier League a year after being taken over by local steel baron Jack Walker, who installed Kenny Dalglish as manager. In 1995, Blackburn became league champions, having spent millions of pounds on players like Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton. However, the title-winning team was quickly split up and, in 1999, the club was relegated. It was promoted back to the Premier League two years later, just after Walker&apos;s death. During this time it has qualified for the UEFA Cup four times: once as League Cup winners, twice as the Premier League&apos;s sixth-placed team and once via the Intertoto Cup. The 2009–10 season marked the club&apos;s 70th non-consecutive year in the top flight. Blackburn are currently one of only five clubs to have won the Premier League, along with Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, and Manchester City. The club&apos;s Latin motto is &quot; Arte et labore &quot;, the club&apos;s translation of which is &quot; By Skill &amp; Hard Work &quot;. [ History ] [ November 2010 ] [ November 2010 ] [ October 2010 ] [ History of Blackburn Rovers F.C. ] [ Early years ] The club was founded following a meeting at the Leger Hotel, Blackburn on 5 November 1875. [ 1875–1884: The early years http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/ThroughTheYears/0%2C%2C10303~78737%2C00.html www.rovers.co.uk 2 July 2007 1 July 2011 ] The first match played by Blackburn Rovers took place in Church, Lancashire on 18 December 1875 and was a 1–1 draw. { The Wednesday &apos; at } { Olive Grove } On 28 September 1878, Blackburn Rovers became one of 23 clubs to form the Lancashire Football Association. On 1 November 1879 the club played in the F.A. Cup for the first time, beating the Tyne Association Football Club 5–1. Rovers were eventually put out of the competition in the third round after suffering a heavy 6–0 defeat by Nottingham Forest. Blackburn Rovers cup winners in 1883–84.

On 25 March 1882 the club won through to the final of the F.A. Cup against the Old Etonians. Blackburn Rovers was the first provincial team to reach the final, but the result was a 1–0 defeat by the Old Etonians. Rovers finally won the F.A. Cup on 29 March 1884 with a 2–1 victory over the Scottish team Queen&apos;s Park F.C.. The same teams played the F.A. Cup final again the next season, with Blackburn Rovers again emerging victorious, with a 2–0 score. Rovers repeated this success yet again the next season, winning the final against West Bromwich Albion. For this three-in-a-row of F.A. Cup victories, the club was awarded a specially commissioned silver shield and given the unique privilege of displaying the club crest on its corner flags. The 1885–86 season was the birth of the legal professional footballer, and Blackburn Rovers spent £615 on player wages for the season. [ Football League commences ] Blackburn Rovers were founder members of the Football League in 1888.

Cup final on 29 March 1890 at the Kennington Oval. The club claimed the trophy for the fourth time, by beating Sheffield Wednesday a hefty 6–1—with left forward William Townley scoring three goals and becoming the first player to achieve a hat-trick in the F.A. Cup final. [ On this day in sport http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-548932/On-day-sport--March-29.html Daily Mail UK 29 March 2008 1 July 2011 ] F.A. Cup winning side of the 1890–91 season The 1890–91 season saw Blackburn Rovers win the F.A. Cup for the fifth time against Notts County F.C. with a 3–1 victory. During the 1897–98 season the club stayed in the first division only as the result of a decision to increase the number of teams from 16 to 18. The season did, however, mark the beginning of Bob Crompton &apos;s 45-year association with the club, both as a player and eventually as an F.A. Cup winning manager. [ Early 20th century ] Blackburn Rovers continued to struggle during the early years of the 20th century, but the results began a gradual improvement. Major renovations were made to Ewood Park: in 1905 the Darwen End was covered at a cost of £1680 and the new Nuttall Stand was opened on New Year&apos;s Day 1907. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Blackburn Rovers were still considered a top side in the English league. They were league champions in 1912 and 1914, and F.A Cup winners in 1928, but the F.A Cup win was their last major trophy for nearly 70 years. [ Mid 20th century ] { English football league system from the inaugural season in } { 1888–89 to } { 2010–11 when Blackburn came fifteenth in the } { Premier League } Blackburn Rovers maintained a respectable mid-table position in the First Division until they were finally relegated (along with Aston Villa) from the top flight (for the first time since the foundation of the league) in the 1935–36 season. When the league resumed after the war, Blackburn Rovers were relegated in their second season (1947–48). At this time the tradition of burying a coffin began. The club remained in the second division for the following ten years. After promotion in 1958, they again returned to the mid-table position they had occupied in the earlier part of the century. During this time, they seldom made a serious challenge for a major trophy – although they did reach the 1960 FA Cup final when managed by Scot Dally Duncan. Rovers lost this game 3–0 to Wolverhampton Wanderers after playing most of the game with only 10 men on the field. There were brief hopes of a return to glory in the 1963–64 season, when a remarkable 8–2 away win over West Ham United in east London on Boxing Day took them to the top of the league. However, their lead of the league was short lived and they finished the season some way down the table as the title was seized by a Liverpool side who would record a further 12 league titles over the next 26 years, while Blackburn&apos;s fortunes took a very different route. { Boxing Day Massacres } They were again relegated from the First Division in 1966 and began a 26-year exile from the top division. [ 1970s and 1980s ] During the 1970s, Blackburn Rovers bounced between the Second and Third Divisions, winning the Third Division title in 1975, but never mounted a challenge for promotion to the First Division despite the efforts of successive managers to put the club back on track. They went up as runners up in the Third Division in 1980 and have remained in the upper two tiers of the English league ever since. In 1988–89 they mounted their first serious promotion challenge for many years, and reached the Second Division playoff final in its last-ever season of the home-away two-legged format – but lost to Crystal Palace. A defeat in the 1989–90 Second Division playoff semi-finals brought more frustration to Ewood Park, but the following season saw the club taken over by local steelworks owner and lifelong supporter Jack Walker (1929–2000). [ 1990s ] Following the Walker takeover Rovers finished 19th in the Second Division at the end of the 1990–91 season, but the new owner had made millions of pounds available to spend on new players and appointed Kenny Dalglish as manager in October 1991. Blackburn secured promotion to the new FA Premier League at the end of 1991-92 season as playoff winners, ending 26 years outside the top flight. Rovers made headlines in the summer of 1992 by paying an English record fee of £3.5million for the 22-year-old Southampton and England centre forward Alan Shearer. After finished fourth in 1993 and runners-up in 1994, they went on the win the Premier League title in 1994–95. The title chase went down to the last game of the season, but despite Rovers losing to Liverpool they edged out rivals Manchester United to win the championship. Kenny Dalglish moved upstairs to the position of Director of Football at the end of the Premier League winning season, and handed over the reins to his assistant Ray Harford. Blackburn Rovers made a poor start to the 1995–96 season, and found themselves in the bottom half for most of the first half of the season. Rovers also struggled in the Champions League and finished bottom of their group with just four points. A terrible start to the 1996–97 Premier League campaign saw Harford resign in late October with the club bottom of the division, having failed to win any of their first ten games. Relegation looked a real possibility, just two seasons after winning the league. Harford was replaced by Roy Hodgson, who joined the club from Internazionale in the summer of 1997. UEFA Cup football was secured with a 6th place finish. However, Rovers made a poor start to the 1998–99 campaign and Hodgson was sacked in December less than an hour after a 2–0 home defeat to bottom side Southampton, a result that locked Rovers in the relegation zone. He was replaced as manager by Brian Kidd. However, he could not save them as the club slipped away, relegation was confirmed with a scoreless draw at home to Manchester United in the penultimate game of the season. [ 2000s ] The Jack Walker Stand during a match In 1999–2000 Rovers began the season as promotion favourites, but with the club hovering just above the Division One relegation zone Brian Kidd was sacked in October and replace in March by Graeme Souness. Jack Walker died just after the start of the 2000–01 season, and the club dedicated its promotion challenge in memory of their benefactor. Fittingly, they returned to the Premier League after a much improved season, finishing second behind Fulham. In 2001–02, Blackburn record signing Andy Cole was bought in for £8million, and Rovers won their first-ever League Cup by beating Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Cole scoring the winner in the 69th minute. The following season Rovers finished sixth to qualify for the UEFA Cup for the second season running. Souness left just after the start of 2004–05 to take charge at Newcastle, and he was replaced by Welsh national coach Mark Hughes. Hughes secured Rovers&apos; Premier League survival for the 2004–05 season as well as an FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, with Rovers finishing 15th once again. He lead the team to sixth the following season and Rovers&apos;s third European qualification in five years. Rovers reached the semi-final of the 2006–07 FA Cup, but lost to Chelsea in extra time, and finashed that season&apos;s league in tenth, qualifying for the Intertoto Cup, which led to a short run in the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. In May 2008, Mark Hughes left Blackburn Rovers for the vacancy at Manchester City. He was replaced by Paul Ince, [ Paul Ince Rovers New Manager Rovers official website 22 June 2008 http://www.rovers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10303~1332318%2C00.html ] Ince&apos;s first job was to persuade some of the wantaway players to stay.

The distinctive blue and white halved jersey is widely acknowledged as the &quot; town colour &quot;. Although the design has remained the same, the side in which the colours fall has often changed. Blue has resided on the wearers left since 1946 however prior to this regulation the blue and white often switched order almost yearly. Blackburn Rovers&apos; first ever kit is however indefinite. The 1905 book; Book of Football by Jonathan Russell describes Blackburn Rovers&apos; first kit as a white jersey with Maltese Cross on the wearers left breast, Trousers and a blue and white skull cap. The Maltese Cross notorious with the public schools in which the founders of the club were educated. In contrast an account from the Blackburn Standard on the 6th January 1894 accounts the first kit as navy blue and white quartered jersey (quartered accounting for the shirts four panels front and back), white knickers and navy hose. This account is much more synonymous with the kit today. Photographic evidence from 1878 shows the team in Blue and white halved (quartered) jerseys, white shorts and blue socks, complete with blue and white cap and Maltese Cross. Through its history the club has adopted four badges and its crest; the Maltese Cross, the towns coat of arms, Lancashire Rose and the present day Blackburn Rovers Badge.From 1875–~1882 The Maltese Cross was present on the clubs first ever home kit and was worn by both the Shrewsbury and Malvern school teams. Two former Malvernians and two former Salopians played in that first team, so there is a clear link with these public schools.During cup finals the team adopted the towns coat of arms as their badge. This tradition carried all the way to the 1960 FA Cup final against Woverhampton Wanderers.From roughly 1882 and excluding cup finals the club didn&apos;t use a badge until 1974. In this year the club opted for an embroidered Lancashire Rose with the clubs initials &quot; B.R.F.C. &quot; below. This badge lasted unchanged for 15 years until it was 1989 due to visibility issues of the dark red rose on the dark blue of the shirt.From 1989 to the present day the current Blackburn Rovers badge has been used. It has encompassed the previous badge in a newer design for the Lancashire Red Rose. Circling the rose is the team name &quot; Blackburn Rovers F.C. &quot; and the date in which the club was founded &quot; 1875 &quot;. At the base of the badge is the club motto, &quot; Arte Et Labore &quot; which translated means, &quot; by skill and by labour &quot;. This motto has been taken from from the town motto which was adopted in 1852.

This field was farmland and was owned by a local farmer, when Blackburn Rovers weren&apos;t using the field it was used to graze cows. In the centre of the field was a large watering hole, which on match days was covered with timber and turf. { Mike Jackman, 2009, Blackburn Rovers The Complete Record, The Breedon Books Publishing Company Limited, Derby. } [ Pleasington Cricket Ground 1877–1878 ] Due to the rough conditions at Oozehead, the committee felt an established sports ground would be best to play on. Therefore half way through the 1877 season they acquired the use of Pleasingtons cricket ground to the south west of the town. Play stopped on this ground after Henry Smith of Preston North End died of a heart attack whilst playing. [ Alexandra Meadows 1878–1881 ] Still adopting cricket grounds, the committee acquired the use of the East Lancashire Cricket Clubs ground in the centre of the town, Alexandra Meadows. The first game played was a friendly against Scottish team Partick on 2 January 1878. It was on this ground Blackburn Rovers played for the first time under artificial light against Accrington on 4 November 1878. [ International Venue ] 26 February 1881England 0 Wales 1 [ Leamington Road 1881–1890 ] Due to the increasing demand in football in the area and in particular for Blackburn Rovers the committee felt that a private ground was more fitting. Therefore in 1881 the club moved to Leamington Road, Blackburn Rovers&apos; first purpose built ground including a £500, 700 people capacity seated grandstand. The first game played at this ground was held on 8 October 1881 against Blackburn Olympic resulting in a 4–1 win for Rovers. Whilst at Leamington Road and under Thomas Mitchell the club won three FA Cups and was inaugurated into the Football League as a founding Member in 1888. However regardless of the clubs success they had to leave Leamington Road due to increases in lease costs. [ International Venue ] 14 March 1885 England 1 Wales 119 March 1885 England 2 Scotland 3 [ Ewood Park 1890 – present ] Built in April 1882 as Ewood Bridge. The ground was an all purpose sporting venue hosting football, athletics and dog racing. The Blackburn Rovers committee felt this was the ideal venue for the club after already playing their for numerous games in 1882. The first game played at the new Ewood Park ground was on 13 September 1890 against Accrington, the 0–0 draw was viewed by 10000 people and on 31 October 1892 artificial lights were installed. Ewood is the oldest consecutive home of a Premier League team, Blackburn having been there longer than Chelsea and Liverpool have been at their present homes, even though their stadia were constructed first. This stadium sits on the bank of the River Darwen in Blackburn, Lancashire. Blackburn is one of only two football clubs (the other being the Wanderers ) to win the FA Cup for three seasons in a row, retaining the exclusive right to place their club logo on the corner flags, despite these victories being achieved at their previous stadium. Ewood Park is also the only football ground in the Premier League to have a multi-faith prayer room. [ Prayer room opened at Ewood Park Lancashire Telegraph 12 August 2008 http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/3586788.Prayer_room_opened_at_Ewood_Park/?action%3Dcomplain%26amp%3Bcid%3D6359589 ] [ Supporters ] Blackburn Rovers supporters have formed several support clubs related to the team, and almost all of them are partially focused on making trips to Ewood Park easier. In addition, although Rovers home games are the least attended in the Premier League for the size of the stadium, on average nearly an amount equal to a fifth of Blackburn (pop. approximately 100,000).Blackburn also have a very vocal support group when it comes to big decisions being made for the club, a support group created on a media site, objecting to the appointment of Sam Allardyce as replacement for outgoing boss Mark Hughes for instance. In January 2006, Blackburn Rovers Supporters Football Club (BRSFC) was formed by a group of Blackburn Rovers supporters through the clubs official message board. This team is not one of a group of breakaway teams such as FC United of Manchester ( Manchester United ) which was created by disgruntled fans in the wake of Malcolm Glazer &apos;s takeover at Old Trafford. BRSFC enjoys an affiliation with Blackburn Rovers Football Club and are registered with the Lancashire Football Association. Celebrity fans include the current Doctor Who Matt Smith, comedians Jim Bowen and Lee Mack, former Justice Secretary Jack Straw, fashion designer Wayne Hemingway and former World Superbike champion Carl Fogarty. President of the Liberal Democrats and MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale Tim Farron is a Rovers fan. [ About Tim Farron http://timfarron.co.uk/en/page/about-tim-farron 7 January 2012 timfarron.co.uk ] Other supporters of Rovers include professional footballers Phil Jones ( Manchester United ), former England International James Beattie and current Republic of Ireland U-21 footballer Anthony Pilkington ( Norwich City ).

Other nearby Manchester clubs including Bury and Rochdale are not considered as rivals as they have never played in the same division. Manchester United is another team located close by to Blackburn Rovers and so are considered a rival by the fans. The rivalry was fiercest in the mid nineties when Blackburn Rovers and Manchester United fought closely for the Premier League title Other Premier League clubs nearby include Manchester City, which rivalry grew fiercer when City signed Rovers manager Mark Hughes in 2009. The local rivalry between Blackburn and Preston North End goes back over one hundred years.
