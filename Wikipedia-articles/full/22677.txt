[ yes ] [ the contradiction in terms the punk band Oxymoron (band) ] [ March 2009 ] [ oxymoron ] An oxymoron (plural oxymorons or oxymora) (from Greek ὀξύμωρον, &quot; sharp dull &quot; ) is a figure of speech that combines contradictory terms. Oxymorons appear in a variety of contexts, including inadvertent errors such as ground pilot and literary oxymorons crafted to reveal a paradox. [ Types ] The most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective - noun combination of two words. For example, the following line from Tennyson &apos;s Idylls of the King contains two oxymora: [ &quot; And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true. &quot; ] Other examples of oxymora of this kind are: Dark light Living dead Open secret Original copy Less often seen are noun- verb combinations of two words, such as the line &quot; The silence whistles &quot; from Nathan Alterman &apos;s Summer Night, or in a record album title like &apos;&apos;Sounds of Silence&apos;&apos;. Oxymora are not always a pair of words; they can also be devised in the meaning of sentences or phrases. [ Etymology ] Oxymoron is derived from the 5th century Latin &quot; oxymoron &quot;, which is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot; ὀξύς &quot; (oxus, sharp) + &quot; μωρός &quot; (mōros, dull).

[ http://dictionary.oed.com.ezproxy.sfpl.org/cgi/entry/50168789 OED.com Dictionary.oed.com.ezproxy.sfpl.org 2012-03-27 ] [ Taxonomy ] Richard Lederer assembled a taxonomy of oxymorons in an article in Word Ways in 1990, { Richard Lederer, &quot; Oxymoronology &quot; Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics, 1990, reprinted on fun-with-words.com } running from single-word oxymorons such as &quot; pianoforte &quot; (literally, &quot; soft-loud &quot; ) through &quot; doublespeak oxymora &quot; (deliberately intended to confuse) and &quot; opinion oxymora &quot; (editorial opinions designed to provoke a laugh). In general, oxymorons can be divided into expressions that were deliberately crafted to be contradictory and those phrases that inadvertently or incidentally contain a contradiction, often as a result of a pun ning use of one or both words. [ Apparent oxymorons ] Many oxymorons have been popularised in vernacular speech. Examples include controlled chaos, open secret, organized mess, alone in a crowd, and accidentally on purpose. [ July 2010 ] There are also examples in which terms that are superficially contradictory are juxtaposed in such a way that there is no contradiction. Examples include same difference, jumbo shrimp, pretty ugly, and hot ice (where hot means stolen and ice means diamonds, respectively, in criminal argot ). [ June 2011 ] [ Oxymorons as paradoxes ] Writers often use an oxymoron to call attention to an apparent contradiction. For example, Wilfred Owen &apos;s poem The Send-off refers to soldiers leaving for the front line, who &quot; lined the train with faces grimly gay. &quot; The oxymoron grimly gay highlights the contradiction between how the soldiers feel and how they act: though they put on a brave face and act cheerful, they feel grim. One case where many oxymorons are strung together can be found in Shakespeare&apos;s Romeo and Juliet, where Romeo declares: [ &quot; O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! &quot; ] Some paradoxical oxymorons become cliché s : Bitter sweet Deafening silence Dry Drunk Forward retreat Irregular pattern Noisy silence Quiet riot Serious joke Sweet sorrow [ Terms falsely called oxymorons for rhetorical effect ] Although a true oxymoron is &quot; something that is surprisingly true, a paradox, &quot; Garry Wills has argued that modern usage has brought a common misunderstanding [ http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Wills-watching-7069 Wills watching by Michael McDonald The New Criterion 2012-03-27 ] that oxymoron is nearly synonymous with contradiction. The introduction of this usage, the opposite of its true meaning, has been credited to William F. Buckley. [ http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200907/william-buckley TheAtlantic.com TheAtlantic.com 2009-07-01 2012-03-27 ] Sometimes a pair of terms is claimed to be an oxymoron by those who hold the opinion that the two are mutually exclusive. That is, although there is no inherent contradiction between the terms, the speaker expresses the opinion that the two terms imply properties or characteristics that cannot occur together. Such claims may be made purely for humorous effect; many examples, such as military intelligence, freedom fighters, business ethics were popularized by comedian George Carlin. Another example is the term civil war, which is not an oxymoron, but can be claimed to be so for humorous effect, if civil is construed as meaning polite rather than between citizens of the same state. Alternatively, such claims may reflect a genuinely held opinion or ideological position. Well-known examples include claims made against &quot; government worker &quot;, &quot; honest broker &quot;, &quot; educational television, &quot; &quot; Microsoft Works &quot; and &quot; working from home &quot;. [ Visual and physical oxymorons ] In his book More on Oxymoron, the artist Patrick Hughes discusses and gives examples of visual oxymorons. He writes: &quot; In the visual version of oxymoron, the material of which a thing is made (or appears to be made) takes the place of the adjective, and the thing itself (or thing represented) takes the place of the noun. &quot; [ Hughes Patrick More on Oxymoron Jonathan Cape Ltd 1984 http://www.patrickhughes.co.uk/papers/more_on_oxymoron_patrick_hughes.pdf 47 0-224-02246-6 ] { (This work is licensed under a Creative Commons License.) According to Hughes&apos; website } [ http://www.patrickhughes.co.uk/books.htm Books authored or co-authored by Patrick Hughes 7 October 2010 ] Examples include waves in the sand, a fossil tree and topiary representing something solid like an ocean liner. Hughes lists further examples of oxymoronic objects including: [ Hughes Patrick More on Oxymoron Jonathan Cape Ltd 1984 72 0-224-02246-6 ] Artificial grass Bricked-up windows China eggs to persuade hens to lay Electric candles Floating soap Invisible ink Joke rubber coat hooks Plastic lemons Rubber bones for dogs Solid water (ice) Solid wooden bottle moulds Wax fruit [ Other languages ] Oxymorons, in the sense of &quot; single-word oxymorons &quot; such as &quot; pianoforte &quot;, are very common in Chinese and neighboring languages such as Japanese, and consist of two opposing Chinese character s. Archetypal examples include 男女 (man and woman, male and female, gender), 陰陽 ( yin and yang ), 善悪 (good and evil, morality), and are used to indicate couples, ranges, or the trait that these are extremes of.
