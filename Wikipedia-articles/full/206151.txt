The common name &quot; bilby &quot; usually refers to this species, but can also be distinguished from Macrotis leucura (the lesser bilby ) that became extinct in the 1950s by the name greater bilby. It is also referred to as the dalgyte, pinkie, or &quot; rabbit-eared bandicoot &quot;. [ No Turning Back: The Life and Death of Animal Species Ellis, Richard Richard Ellis (biologist) New York Harper Perennial 2005 224 0-06-055804-0 ] Bilbies live in arid areas of central Australia. Their range and population is in decline. [ Habitat ] Once widespread in arid, semi-arid and relatively fertile areas, the bilby is now restricted to arid regions and remains a threatened species. It makes its home in a burrow that spirals down, making it hard for its predators to get in. { The bilby prefers arid habitats because of the } { spinifex grass and the } { acacia shrubs. } [ Bilby AustralianAnimals.net http://australian-animals.net/bilby.htm December 2010 ] [ Characteristics ] Bilbies have the characteristics of long bandicoot muzzle and very long ears. They are about [ 29 – 55 cm ] in length. Compared to bandicoots, they have a longer tail, bigger ears, and softer, silky fur. The size of their ears allows them to have better hearing as well. At [ 1 to 2.4 kg ], the male is about the same size as a rabbit; although male animals in good condition have been known to grow up to [ 3.7 kg ] in captivity. The female is smaller, and weighs around [ 0.8 to 1.1 kg ]. Bilbies have an excellent sense of smell and sharp hearing. Their fur is blue-grey with patches of tan and is very soft. The tail is black and white with a distinct crest. Bilbies have strong forelimbs and thick claws, which they use to dig for food and make burrows. Unlike bandicoots, they are excellent burrowers and build extensive tunnel systems with their strong forelimbs and well-developed claws. A bilby typically makes a number of burrows within its home range, up to about a dozen; and moves between them, using them for shelter both from predators and the heat of the day. The female bilby&apos;s pouch faces backwards, which prevents her pouch from getting filled with dirt while she is digging. Bilbies have a very short gestation period of about 12–14 days, one of the shortest among mammals. [ Macdonald, D. Gordon, Greg 1984 The Encyclopedia of Mammals Facts on File New York 846–9 0-87196-871-1 ] [ Diet ] Bilbies are nocturnal omnivores that do not need to drink water, as they get all the moisture they need from their food, which includes insects and their larvae, seeds, spiders, bulbs, fruit, fungi, and very small animals. Most food is found by digging or scratching in the soil, and using their very long tongues. [ Conservation ] Bilbies are slowly becoming endangered because of habitat loss and change as well as the competition with other animals. Feral cats pose a major threat to the bilby&apos;s survival, and there is some competition between bilbies and rabbits for food. There is a national recovery plan being developed for saving these animals: this program includes breeding in captivity, monitoring populations, and reestablishing bilbies where they once lived. There have been reasonably successful moves to popularise the bilby as a native alternative to the Easter Bunny by selling chocolate Easter Bilbies (sometimes with a portion of the profits going to bilby protection and research). Reintroduction efforts have also begun, with a successful reintroduction into the Arid Recovery Reserve in South Australia in 2000, [ Moseby, K.E.; O&apos;Donnell, E.O. Reintroduction of the greater bilby, Macrotis lagotis(Reid) (Marsupialia: Thylacomyidae), to northern South Australia: survival, ecology and notes on reintroduction protocols Wildlife Research 30 15–27 2003 http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/WR02012.htm ] and plans underway for a reintroduction into Currawinya National Park in Queensland, [ Save The Bilby Appeal 2004 Queensland Government http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/about_the_epa/media_room/media_statements/fact_sheets/save_the_bilbies/ ] with a recent success with six bilbies released into the feral-free sanctuary in early February 2006. Successful reintroductions have also occurred onto Peron Peninsula in Western Australia as a part of { Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation &apos;Project Eden&apos; } Western Shield. Successful reintroductions have also occurred on other conservation lands, including islands and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy &apos;s { Australian Wildlife Conservancy } Scotia { Australian Wildlife Conservancy Scotia Sanctuary } and Yookamurra Sanctuaries. { Australian Wildlife Conservancy Yookamurra Sanctuary } There is a highly-successful bilby breeding program at Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, { Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre (Inc.) } near Perth, Western Australia. [ Taxonomy ] [ Nomenclature ] A scientific description of the bilby was first published in 1837 by a Mr J. Reid. Reid based his description on a specimen that he erroneously stated to have come from Van Diemen&apos;s Land (now Tasmania ), where the species has not occurred in historical times. [ Bandicoots and Bilbies 1990 ] As all bandicoot species were then placed in a broadly circumscribed Perameles, [ Groves, Colin; Flannery, Tim Revision of the families and genera of bandicoots 1–11 ] Reid placed the bilby there too. However, noting how different it was from other members of the genus, he added that &quot; should more of the same form be discovered, the above characters would constitute a subgenus to which the name of Macrotis might be applied &quot;. The specific epithet lagotis was chosen &quot; from its resemblance to the Rabbit &quot;. [ Reid, J 1837 Description of a new species of the genus Perameles(P.  lagotis) Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 129–131 5 1 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1837.tb06823.x/abstract 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1837.tb06823.x January ] The following year, Richard Owen read a paper before the Zoological Society of London, in which he proposed to erect a new genus for this species, named Thylacomys. [ Owen, Richard 1838 [Thylacomys] The Athenaeum 747 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DiGxIAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA747 ] This name was widely adopted and remained in use for many years. Thus it was that when B. Arthur Bensley erected a subfamily to hold the genus in 1903, he named it Thylacomyinae. This name remains valid, and has since been promoted to family rank as Thylacomyidae, but Thylacomys itself is no longer considered valid, as Reid&apos;s original paper is held to have established the generic name Macrotis. Thus the currently accepted scientific name for the species is Macrotis lagotis. [ June 2011 ] [ Classification ] The placement of bilbies within the Peramelemorphia has changed in recent years. Vaughan (1978) and Groves and Flannery (1990) both placed this family within the Peramelidae family. Kirsch et al. (1997) found them to be distinct from the species in Peroryctidae (which is now a subfamily in Peramelidae). McKenna and Bell (1997) also placed it in Peramelidae, but as the sister of Chaeropus in the subfamily Chaeropodinae. [ 38 ] [ Etymology ] The term bilby is a loan word from the Yuwaalaraay Aboriginal language of northern New South Wales, meaning long-nosed rat. It is known as dalgite in Western Australia, and the nickname pinkie is sometimes used in South Australia. { http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/aewords/aewords_ab.php } [ December 2010 ] The Wiradjuri of New South Wales also call it bilby. [ Yokose, Hiroyuki Aboriginal Words in Australian English 2001 PDF 171 (3 in PDF) http://www.tsukuba-g.ac.jp/library/kiyou/2001/13.YOKOSE.pdf ] [ Popular culture ] A National Bilby Day is held in Australia on the second Sunday in September to raise funds for conservation projects.
