The album was released on 30 September 2003. The album featured smoother, R &amp; B-style beats and experiments collaborating with hip-hop artist Mary J. Blige and sitar player Anoushka Shankar. Some songs like &quot; Inside &quot; and &quot; Dead Man&apos;s Rope &quot; were well received; and Sting had experimented with new sounds, in particular the more rock -influenced &quot; This War &quot;. Sting adapted the first quatrain of William Blake &apos;s Auguries of Innocence for the first four sung lines of &quot; Send Your Love &quot;. Sting&apos;s collaboration with Blige, &quot; Whenever I Say Your Name &quot;, won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004.
