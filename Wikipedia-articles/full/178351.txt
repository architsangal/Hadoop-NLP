The islands are separated from the mainland by the [ 3 km ] wide Moldefjord. To the north the open sea begins, although the smaller (yet populated) islands of Harøya and Fjørtofta are even further out. These islands are part of the communities of Sandøy and Haram and are about [ 5 km ] away from Otrøya. The three largest islands of the community lie in a line from ENE to WSW ( Otrøya, Midøya, and Dryna ). Magerøy is between Midøy and Otrøy, a bridge connects it to the latter. Tautra lies in the Moldefjord. Otrøya is the main island of the community, measuring about [ 20 km ] from east to west. The southern coast of Otrøya, Midøya, and Dryna rises from the fjord as sheer [ 800 m on ] tall cliffs. At Oppstad, the cliff is feared to collapse, which would cause a small tsunami in the Moldefjord. On the southcoast of Otrøya the following small villages can be found: (from east to west) Solholmen, Nord-Heggdal, Oppstad, Sør-Heggdal, and Klauset. The north has the following villages: (east to west) Ræstad, Rakvåg, Tangen, Raknes, and Uglvik. On the western side of Otrøya, facing the bay that separates it from Midøya, lies the village of Midsund, the largest settlement in the community. The Midsund Bridge connects it with Midøya. Dryna and Midøya are also connected with a bridge. Ferries run between the islands and the mainland, they go across the Julsund to Molde (from Solholmen) and Brattvåg (from Dryna). The larger three islands&apos; interior is wilderness, but the rims are used for keeping cattle and small farming. [ Demographics ] The community has 1,939 inhabitants (January 2005), with 50.3% male. The percentage of people older than 67 is 18.3%. Unemployment is 2.3%. Population growth is stable. Most inhabitants are fishers or small farmers.
