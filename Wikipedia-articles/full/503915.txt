Released on 26 August 2002 in the UK through the label Parlophone, the album was produced by the band and British record producer Ken Nelson.

The album was made available in August 2002, two months after its original planned release date. It was released on 27 August in the United States through Capitol Records. Capitol released a remastered version of the album in 2008 on a 180-gram vinyl record as part of the &quot; From the Capitol Vaults &quot; series. The album debuted and continued their huge commercial legacy, an ongoing pattern that began with Parachutes which made Coldplay one of the best-selling bands worldwide. It topped the UK Album Charts upon its first week of release in the United Kingdom, and became the eighth biggest-selling albums in the 21st century in the UK.

In 2003 it was ranked number 473 on Rolling Stone &apos;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

They decided to relocate to Liverpool due to the trouble they had in London, and where they had recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Vocalist Chris Martin said that once there they &quot; became obsessed with recording &quot;. &quot; In My Place &quot; was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album&apos;s lead single &quot; because it was the song that made us want to do a second album. It kept us going and made us think we could still write songs &quot;, following &quot; a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing &quot; three months after the success of Parachutes. The band wrote more than 20  songs for the album and some of those new tracks, including &quot; In My Place &quot; and &quot; Animals &quot;, were performed live during the tours promoting Parachutes.

Each Monday they would present the song ideas they had developed to their band mates. With A Rush of Blood to the Head nearly completed, Martin went into the studio late one night and wrote a piano riff that he has stated &quot; just came out &quot;. The band recognised that this early version of the song, that would become &quot; Clocks &quot;, was special the first time Martin played it to them. Reasoning that it was too late to include the song on the album, they recorded a demo version and included it on a CD marked &quot; Songs for #3 &quot;, featuring unfinished tracks they intended to work on for their third studio album.

Subsequently many songs were discarded because they sounded like they could have been on Parachutes. Martin has claimed that it would have been uninteresting: &quot; It would have shown that we&apos;re happy to sit back on what we&apos;d done, and we&apos;re not. For us it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians. &quot; Such ambitions put the band under strain: &quot; sometimes practice sessions ended abruptly with one or more members of Coldplay threatening to quit &quot;.

Phil Harvey, the band&apos;s manager, heard &quot; Clocks &quot; and urged them to rework it immediately: &quot; No, you must do that song now &apos;cause you&apos;re going on [in the lyrics] about urgency, and you&apos;re talking about keeping this song back. That doesn&apos;t make sense. &quot; [ Cover art ] The album cover for A Rush of Blood to the Head was designed by photographer Sølve Sundsbø. Sundsbø had been hired by fashion magazine Dazed &amp; Confused in the late 1990s to produce something with a &quot; technological feel, something all white &quot;. As an artist, he tried to do &quot; stuff that hasn&apos;t been done before, which is virtually impossible &quot;; he suggested taking shots using a three-dimensional scanning machine.

Capitol (CDP 7243 5 40504 2 8). } The editor of the magazine liked the image and eventually featured it in one of their publications. Martin saw the image in the magazine and approached Sundsbø for permission to use the image as the cover of A Rush of Blood to the Head. For the album&apos;s singles, Martin asked Sundsbø what he could do; the latter suggested scanning the head of each member of the band (Sundsbø also done artwork duties for the Live 2003 home video).

Ogg ] Recording the album after the 11 September attacks gave the band a fresh perspective: &quot; The new songs are reflective of new attitudes. [They tell listeners] not to be frightened. Anybody can achieve whatever they want to. &quot; Most of the song lyrics are about urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: &quot; Perhaps there&apos;s a bit more urgency on some of these songs. And that&apos;s born from all the places we&apos;ve been and the things we&apos;ve experienced. &quot; Martin has explained, in relation to the theme of urgency, that the album&apos;s title means &quot; doing something on impulse &quot;. Several songs on the album are about relationships. These tracks are based on reality, but according to Martin, they were written with a fictional twist: &quot; Songs are like fairy tale s : they have a beginning and an end and you can make it all work perfectly. Real life doesn&apos;t work like that &quot;. The album includes ballad s and acoustic songs featuring extensive use of guitar and piano. The U2 -esque &quot; epic rock &quot; of the album&apos;s opening track &quot; Politik &quot;, the piano-driven &quot; Clocks &quot;, and the loud guitars of &quot; A Whisper &quot; were seen as an extension of the band&apos;s musical range.
