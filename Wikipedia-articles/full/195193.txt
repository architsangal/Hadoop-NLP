In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is an imaginary dome where the sun, stars, planets, and the moon are seen to be traveling. The celestial sphere is divided into regions called constellation s. Usually, the term sky is used from the point of view of the Earth&apos;s surface. However, the exact meaning of the term can vary; in some cases, the sky is defined as only the denser portions of the atmosphere, for example. During daylight, the sky appears to be blue because air scatters blue sunlight more than it scatters red.

During the day, the Sun can be seen in the sky, unless obscured by cloud s. In the night sky (and to some extent during the day) the moon, planet s and stars are visible in the sky. Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are cloud s, rainbow s, and aurorae. Lightning and precipitation can also be seen in the sky during storm s. Bird s, insect s, aircraft, and kite s are often considered to fly in the sky. As a result of human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are often seen above large cities.

The scattering due to molecule sized particles (as in air) is greater in the forward and backward directions than it is in the lateral direction.

The remaining sunlight, having lost some of its short wavelength components, appears slightly less blue. Scattering also occurs even more strongly in cloud s. Individual water droplets exposed to white light will create a set of colored rings. If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed out white color.

Scattering effects also partially polarize light from the sky, most pronounced at an angle 90° from the sun. Scattered light from the horizon has traveled through as much as 38 times the atmosphere than has light from the zenith, causing it to lose blue components. The result is a blue gradient — vivid at the zenith, pale near the horizon. { Why is the sky bluer on top than at the horizon } Because red light scatters as well if there is enough air in between the source and the observer, these longer wavelengths of light will also scatter significantly, making parts of the sky change color during a sunset. As the amount of atmosphere nears infinity, the scattered light appears more and more white. The sun is not the only object that may appear less blue in atmosphere. Far away clouds or snowy mountaintops will seem yellow as well; that effect is not obvious on clear days, but very pronounced when clouds are covering the line of sight reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight.

Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass [ Earth&apos;s shadow Green flash Sky brightness ] The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required. Some of the more common phenomenae that can be observed during this period are described below. Green flash es and green rays are optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, when a green spot is visible, usually for no more than a second or two, above the sun, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. Green flashes are a group of phenomena stemming from different causes, [ Young, A. http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html Green flashes at a glance 2006 San Diego State University page 2009-03-05 ] most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when temperatures increase with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). Green flashes may be observed from any altitude (even from an aircraft). They usually are seen at an unobstructed horizon, such as over the ocean, but are possible over cloud tops and mountain tops as well. A green flash also may be observed in association with the Moon and bright planets at the horizon, including Venus and Jupiter. [ Nave C.R.

This atmospheric phenomenon can sometimes be seen twice a day, around the times of sunset and sunrise. When the weather conditions and the observer&apos;s viewing point permit a clear sight of the horizon, the shadow can be seen as a dark blue or greyish-blue band. Assuming the sky is clear, the Earth&apos;s shadow is visible in the opposite half of the sky to the sunset or sunrise, and is seen right above the horizon as a dark blue band. A related phenomenon is the &quot; Belt of Venus &quot; or &quot; anti-twilight arch &quot; (sometimes written as &quot; antitwilight arch &quot; ), a pink band that is visible above the dark blue of the Earth&apos;s shadow, in the same part of the sky. There is no clear dividing line between the Earth&apos;s shadow and the Belt of Venus; one colored band shades into the other in the sky.

After sunset the civil twilight sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes the astronomical twilight defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness. [ http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/twilight/index.htm University of Toronto Dr. Irv Bromberg 2011-04-04 2012-02-15 The Duration of Twilight ] Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely airglow, indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial light pollution. [ During the night ] { Milky Way can be seen as a large band across the night sky, and is distorted into an arch in this 360° panorama. } [ Night sky ] The term night sky refers to the sky as seen at night. The term is usually associated with skygazing and astronomy, with reference to views of celestial bodies such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed. Were the sky (in the absence of moon and city lights) absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky. The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, farmers have used the state of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops. The ancient belief in astrology is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The scientific study of the night sky and bodies observed within it, meanwhile, takes place in the science of astronomy. Within visible-light astronomy, the visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.

Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus cloud s can lead to halo s around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain.

Within 24  hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the bar of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. Within 18  hours of the center&apos;s approach, squall y weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. Within six hours of the center&apos;s arrival, rain becomes continuous. Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center&apos;s passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. By 36  hours after the center&apos;s passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off. { Central Pacific Hurricane Center (2006-07-23).
