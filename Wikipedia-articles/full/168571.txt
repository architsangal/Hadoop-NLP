[ y 1986 6 13 ] { 104 minutes } { English } Mona Lisa is a 1986 British film about a petty criminal who becomes entangled in the dangerous life of a high-class call girl. The movie was written by Neil Jordan and David Leland, and directed by Jordan. It was produced by George Harrison &apos;s HandMade Films. It stars Bob Hoskins, Cathy Tyson and Michael Caine. [ Synopsis ] George (Hoskins), recently released from prison, is given a cushy job as the driver for a high-class prostitute named Simone (Tyson) by his former boss, Denny Mortwell (Caine). As George and Simone find out more about each other, they form a friendship despite possibly conflicting incentives. Central to this theme is Mortwell&apos;s wish for George to find out as much as he can about one of Simone&apos;s &apos;regulars&apos;, a wealthy businessman seen with Mortwell on one occasion. George then helps Simone in her quest to find an abused friend from her murky past, and this leads to a violent resolution in the seedy underworld.

Film critic Roger Ebert wrote of the two main characters &quot; The relationship of their characters in the film is interesting, because both people, for personal reasons, have developed a style that doesn&apos;t reveal very much. &quot; { Ebert, Roger (2 July 1986) &quot; Review: &apos;&apos;Mona Lisa&apos;&apos; &quot; RogerEbert.SunTimes.com (Retrieved: 12 March 2010) } However, Vincent Canby, writing for the New York Times, dismissed the film as &quot; classy kitsch. &quot; { Canby, Vincent (13 July 1986) &quot; Movie Review: &apos;&apos;Mona Lisa&apos;&apos; (1986) &quot; } { &apos;&apos;NYTimes.com&apos;&apos; (Retrieved: 12 March 2010) } Bob Hoskins was praised for his performance and was awarded the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Cannes Film Festival, and other awards.
