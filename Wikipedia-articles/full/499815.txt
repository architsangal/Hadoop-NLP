[ Administration ] On a provincial level, Kananaskis Country has been administered since 1945 as Improvement District No. 5 (Kananaskis). { Kananaskis Improvement District - Alberta Municipal Affairs } It was established by the Municipal Affairs branch of the Alberta Government for multiple uses including timber harvesting, gas and oil extraction, cattle grazing, recreation and tourism. All activities are planned and facilities are developed with watershed protection as a priority. Not all areas of Kananaskis Country are covered by the same measure of protection. Areas within Kananaskis Country include Provincial Parks, Provincial Recreation Areas, Wildland Provincial Parks, and Ecological Reserves. All of the aforementioned categories are governed by differing laws. A management plan approved in March 2003 by the Kananaskis Country restricts further development in the Spray Valley Provincial Park area, in order to preserve the ecological integrity. Restrictions were imposed on off-road vehicles, snowmobiles, horseback riding and biking, however a site in the Spray Valley is considered for the construction of a small lodge. { FFWD article (August 2003).
