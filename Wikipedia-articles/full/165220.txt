Spruance ] [ September 2010 ] The United States Pacific Fleet (USPACFLT) is a Pacific Ocean theater-level component command of the United States Navy that provides naval forces to the United States Pacific Command. Its headquarters is at Pearl Harbor Naval Base, Hawaii. A Pacific Fleet was created in 1907 when the Asiatic Squadron and the Pacific Squadron were combined. In 1910, the ships of the First Squadron were organized back into a separate Asiatic Fleet. The General Order of 6 December 1922 organized the United States Fleet, with the Battle Fleet as the Pacific presence. Until May 1940, the Battle Fleet was stationed on the west coast of the United States. During the summer of that year, as part of the U.S. response to Japanese expansionism, it was instructed to take an &quot; advanced &quot; position at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Long term basing at Pearl Harbor was so strongly opposed by the commander, Admiral James O. Richardson, that he personally protested in Washington. Political considerations were thought sufficiently important that he was relieved by Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who was in command at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Pacific Fleet was formally recreated on 1 February 1941. On that day General Order 143 split the United States Fleet into separate Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic Fleet s. [ Composition of the Pacific Fleet in May 1941 ] On 7 December, the Fleet consisted of the Battle Force, Scouting Force, Base Force, Amphibious Force (ComPhibPac), { Orbat.com/Niehorster, Administrative Order of Battle 7 December 1941 } and the Submarine Force ( COMSUBPAC ). { 7 December, ComSubPac was Admiral } { Thomas Withers, Jr., who relieved } { Wilhelm L. Friedell that fall. Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (New York: Bantam, 1976), pp.83 &amp; 223. } Also in Hawaii was the Fourteenth Naval District, commanded by Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch. The Battle Force consisted of Battleships, Battle Force, made up of three Battleship Divisions: Battleship Division 1 with [ Pennsylvania BB-38 ] and [ Arizona BB-39 ] with [ Nevada BB-36 ]; Battleship Division 2 with [ Tennessee BB-43 ] and [ California BB-44 ] with [ Oklahoma BB-37 ]; and [ Colorado BB-45 ], [ Maryland BB-46 ] and [ West Virginia BB-48 ]. These nine battleships were intended to counterbalance the ten battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, [ Pennsylvania BB-38 ] was in dry dock and [ Colorado BB-45 ] was being refitted at Bremerton Navy Yard, Washington State. [ Arizona BB-39 ] was mated with [ Nevada BB-36 ] and [ Oklahoma BB-37 ] at that time. Other components of the Battle Force included Aircraft, Battle Force, with Carrier Division One and Carrier Division Two, plus Cruiser Divisions 4, 5, and 6, as well as Destoryers, Battle Force. { http://www.orbat.com/site/ww2/drleo/013_usa/_41_usn/pac-bat_destroyers_1.html } The Scouting Force included Cruiser Division Three ( [ Richmond CL-9 ], [ Concord CL-10 ], and [ Trenton CL-11 ] ) and Cruiser Division Nine and Submarines, Scouting Force. { Cruisers, Battle Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, 7.12.1941 } The Amphibious Force was formally known as Commander, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet (ComPhibPac). On 7 December 1941 the Amphibious Force comprised the Army&apos;s 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, under Army operational control, the 2nd Marine Division, the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, the 2nd Defense Battalion (see Marine defense battalions ), and a depot. { Orbat.com/Niehorster, Amphibious Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet } One of PhibPac&apos;s subordinate commands during World War II was Transports, Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, or TransPhibPac. The commander of TransPhibPac was known as ComTransPhibPac. In December 1941, the fleet consisted of nine battleship s, three aircraft carrier s, 12 heavy cruisers, eight light cruisers, 50 destroyer s, 33 submarine s, and 100 patrol bomber s. [ April 2011 ] This was approximately the fleet&apos;s strength at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That day, the Japanese Combined Fleet carried out the attack on Pearl Harbor, initiating World War II in the Pacific. The Pacific Fleet&apos;s Battle Line was virtually destroyed, forcing the U.S. Navy to rely primarily on aircraft carriers and submarines for many months afterward. Subsequently Pacific Fleet engagements during World War II included the Battle of Guam, the Marshalls-Gilberts raids, the Doolittle Raid, the Solomon Islands campaign, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and the Battle of Okinawa. More minor battles included the Battle of Dutch Harbor. The Submarine Force began a sustained campaign of commerce raiding against Japan&apos;s merchant marine, beginning the very first day of the war, which ultimately claimed 1,314 ships totalling about 5.3 million tons (by the imperfect postwar reckoning of the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee, JANAC). { Blair, pp.877-8. } [ Post 1945 ] The Pacific Fleet took part in Operation Magic Carpet, the return of U.S. servicemen, after the end of the Second World War.The organization of the Pacific Fleet in January 1947 is shown in Hal M. Friedman&apos;s &apos;Arguing over the American Lake: Bureaucracy and Rivalry in the U.S. Pacific, 1945-1947.&apos; { Hal M. Friedman, &apos;Arguing over the American Lake: Bureaucracy and Rivalry in the U.S. Pacific, 1945-47&apos; Texas A &amp; M University Press, 2009, ISBN 1603441255, 105-108. } Since 1950 the Pacific Fleet has been involved in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the two Taiwan Straits Crises, and a number of other operations including the Mayaguez Incident of 1975, as well as post-Vietnam related operations such as Operation New Arrivals. The RIMPAC exercise series began in 1971. The very large PACEX &apos;89 in the North Pacific involved the USN, Canadian Navy, Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force, and ROK Navy. At the end of Exercise PACEX &apos;89 a 54 ship formation was assembled for photos. It included the flagship, [ Blue Ridge LCC-19 ], the [ Enterprise CVN-65 ] Battle Group, the [ Carl Vinson CVN-70 ] Battle Group, two battleship surface action groups formed around the [ New Jersey BB-62 ] and [ Missouri BB-63 ], and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force task force. [ April 2011 ] Other operations undertaken since include participation in the Alaskan Oil Spill Joint Task Force, including participation of Commander, Amphibious Group Three, as deputy CJTF. This was the defence response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill of March 1989. Also, the Pacific Fleet was involved in Joint Task Force Philippines during the December 1989 coup attempt there, which involved two carrier battle groups, USS Midway and USS Enterprise-with their associated air wings operating in the Philippine Sea, chopped to JTF Philippines. During the operations, the carriers maintained deck alerts and 24-hour coverage of Manila with E-2C aircraft. { Center for Naval Analysis, Joint Task Force Operations since 1983, CRM94-42, July 1994 } Around September 10, 1990, [ http://www.dodmedia.osd.mil/DefenseLINK_Search/Still_Details.cfm?SDAN%3DDNSC9102252%26amp%3BJPGPath%3D%2FAssets%2F1991%2FNavy%2FDN-SC-91-02252.JPG Still Asset Details for DNSC9102252 2007-04-22 DefenseLink ] [ Princeton CG-59 ] and the [ Reuben James FFG-57 ] visited Vladivostok. This marked the first United States Navy visit to the Soviet Union &apos;s Pacific port of Vladivostok since before World War II. Before the visit was completed, the crew received word that their Pacific cruise was canceled. They returned to Long Beach and joined the [ Ranger CV-61 6 ] Battle Group preparing to deploy to the Persian Gulf. During Operation Fiery Vigil in June 1991, the following vessels participated in the sealift phase of the evacuation: the Lincoln battle group (COMCARGRU 3 embarked): [ Abraham Lincoln CVN-72 ], [ Long Beach CGN-9 ], [ Lake Champlain ], [ Merrill ], [ Gary ], [ Ingraham ], [ Roanoke ], Amphibious Ready Group Alpha (COMPHIBRON 3 embarked): [ Peleliu LHA-5 ], [ Cleveland ], [ Comstock ], [ Bristol County ], and a large number of other vessels: [ Midway ], [ Curts ], [ Rodney M. Davis ], [ Thach ], [ Arkansas ], [ McClusky ], [ St. Louis ], [ San Bernardino ], [ 1st Lt Lummus ], [ American Condor ], [ Niagara Falls ], [ Ponchatoula ], [ Passumpsic ], [ Hassayampa ], [ Haleakala ], [ Spica ], [ Cape Cod ]. (CNA, 1994, 113) Further operations included JTF Marianas (August-September 1992) and JTF Hawaii (September-October 1992). Other contingency operation after 1991 included Operation Sea Angel (Bangladesh relief) (led by Commander III Marine Expeditionary Force ), Operation Eastern Exit, and involvement in the Somali Civil War - &apos;Restore Hope&apos;. During &apos;Restore Hope,&apos; Navy command arrangements underwent a number of changes during the operation. At the start, the principal naval forces were the Ranger battle group (with Commander, Carrier Group One embarked on [ Ranger CV-61 ] as Commander, Naval Forces), the Kitty Hawk battle group, an amphibious task unit including [ Tripoli LPH-10 ], [ Juneau ], [ Rushmore ], and MV Lummus, and three ships from MPSRON TWO (MV Anderson, MV Bonnyman, and MV Phillips). Other events led to the departure of the carriers and, as a result, Commander, Naval Forces responsibilities devolved first to Commander, Carrier Group Three, on Kitty Hawk, and thence to Commander, Amphbious Group Three. Finally Commander, Amphibious Squadron 3 became COMNAVFOR on 15 January with the departure of COMPHIGRU THREE after the completion of the MPF offload. (CNA, 1994, 168) In 1995 Pacific Fleet surface ships were reshuffled. { Kitsap Sun, Pacific Fleet Changes, July 25, 1995 } Effective Oct. 1, 1995 the U.S. Pacific Fleet&apos;s surface ships were to be reorganized into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons. Permanent core battle groups were to include a battle group commander, aircraft carrier, carrier air wing and at least two cruisers.

Later ships of the Pacific Fleet, notably the [ Ticonderoga cruiser ] [ Mobile Bay CG-53 ] provided support to the entry of INTERFET in East Timor in 1999. Between 25–27 March 2006, Carrier Strike Group Nine participated in a series of anti-submarine warfare exercises (ASW) in Hawaiian waters while en route to the U.S. Seventh Fleet &apos;s area of responsibility. In addition to the strike group, the exercise also included the nuclear-powered attack submarines [ Seawolf SSN-21 2 ], [ Cheyenne SSN-773 2 ], [ Greeneville SSN-772 2 ], [ Tucson SSN-770 2 ], and [ Pasadena SSN-752 2 ], as well as land-based P-3 Orion aircraft from Commander Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 2 and associated patrol squadrons VP-4, VP-9, and VP-47.
