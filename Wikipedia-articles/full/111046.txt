During the years 1930-1933, Robbins Airport, the first to be owned and operated by African Americans in the United States, was located here. It had the only flight school at the time where African Americans could be trained as pilots. It served as a model for the Tuskegee Airmen Program during WW II. Many great African-American pilots flew into this forgotten airport. the surrounding White communities, such as Blue Island and Midlothian, did not approve of this activity, and their police sometimes arrested black pilots after they had landed in Robbins. The one runway airport and hangar were destroyed by a tornado in 1933. School and operations were relocated by the invitation of white owners of the Harlem Airport in Chicago (it was located south of present-day Midway International Airport). From there many of the flight school instructors entered the Tuskegee Airmen Program. One notable instructor was John C. Robinson, who entered WWII as Supreme Commander of The Ethiopian Air Force. The activities of these men and women have been recognized by the Smithsonian Institution &apos;s Air and Space Museum.
