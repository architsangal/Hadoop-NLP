[ July 2009 ] [ 29 November 1856 ] [ 1 January 1921 ] { none } Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg (29 November 1856 – 1 January 1921) was a German politician and statesman who served as Chancellor of the German Empire from 1909 to 1917. [ Biography ] [ Origins ] Bethmann Hollwig was born in Hohenfinow, Brandenburg, the son of Prussia n official Felix von Bethmann Hollweg. His grandfather was August von Bethmann Hollweg, who had been a prominent law scholar, president of Frederick William University in Berlin, and Prussian Minister of Culture. His great grandfather was Johann Jakob Hollweg, who had married a daughter of the Frankfurt am Main banking family of Bethmann, which attained great prosperity in the 18th century. [ Bethmann Hollweg, Theobald von ] Cosima Wagner was his relative from the von Bethmanns side, and his mother Isabella de Rougemont was a French Swiss. [ Early life ] He was educated at the boarding school of Schulpforta and at the Universities of Strasbourg, Leipzig and Berlin. Entering the Prussian administrative service in 1882 he rose to the position of the President of the Province of Brandenburg in 1899. In 1889, Bethmann Hollweg married Martha von Pfuel, niece of Ernst von Pfuel, Prime Minister of Prussia. From 1905 to 1907 Bethmann Hollweg served as Prussian Minister of Interior, then as Imperial State Secretary for the Interior from 1907 to 1909. In 1909, on the resignation of Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow, Bethmann Hollweg was appointed to succeed him. { Scrap of Paper Chancellor of Germany Dies, The Globe.

Despite the increase in tensions due to the Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911, Bethmann Hollweg did improve relations with Britain to some extent, working with British foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey to alleviate tensions during the Balkan Crises of 1912-1913, and negotiating treaties over an eventual partition of the Portuguese colonies and the Berlin-Baghdad railway. In domestic politics, Bethmann Hollweg&apos;s record was also mixed, and his policy of the &quot; diagonal &quot;, which endeavoured to maneuver between the Socialists and Liberals of the left and the right-wing nationalists of the right, only succeeded in alienating most of the German political establishment. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, Bethmann Hollweg and Foreign Secretary Gottlieb von Jagow were instrumental in assuring Austria of Germany&apos;s unconditional support regardless of Austria&apos;s actions against Serbia. And as Sir Edward Grey suggested a mediation between the Austrians and the Serbs Bethmann-Hollweg is known to have been manipulating the British message - in order to forestall any chance that the Austrians would retain from attacking Serbia - by deleting the last line of the letter which read: [ &quot; Also, the whole world here is convinced, and I hear from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy. &quot; Fischer, 1967, p.71 ] In the last days before the outbreak of war, once it became clear that, should war break out, British involvement was inevitable, he appeared to have some second thoughts, and he took half-hearted measures to prevent an all out war, until Russia&apos;s mobilization on 31 July 1914, took the matter out of his hands. Bethmann Hollweg, much of whose foreign policy before the war had been guided by his desire to establish good relations with Britain, was particularly upset by Britain&apos;s declaration of war following German violation of Belgium&apos;s neutrality in the course of her invasion of France, reportedly asking the departing British Ambassador Goschen how Britain could go to war over a &quot; mere scrap of paper &quot; (the Treaty of London of 1839 which guaranteed Belgium &apos;s neutrality). However, it is accepted that Hollweg was involved closely in the decisions that authorised plans to destabilise Britain&apos;s colonies, most notably the Hindu German Conspiracy.

He never served in the army, but after the war started he was appointed to an honorary rank which carried with it the wearing of a general&apos;s uniform. 1920 Bethmann-Hollweg, Theobald Theodore Friedrich Alfred von 1 During the war, Bethmann Hollweg has usually been seen as having generally attempted to pursue a relatively moderate policy, but having been frequently outflanked by the military leaders, who played an increasingly important role in the direction of all German policy. However, this view has been partially superseded, as the work of historian Fritz Fischer in the 1960s showed that Bethmann Hollweg made more concessions to the nationalist right than had previously been thought. He supported the goal of ethnically cleansing Poles from the Polish Border Strip, as well germanisation of Polish territories by settlement of German colonists.

Hull Cornell 233 University Press 2005 ] He presented the Septemberprogramm, which outlined the aggressively expansionist goals for the war. After Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff replaced the more ineffectual Erich von Falkenhayn at the General Staff in the summer of 1916, his hopes for American President Woodrow Wilson &apos;s mediation at the end of 1916 came to nothing, and, over Bethmann Hollweg&apos;s objections, Hindenburg and Ludendorff forced the adoption of unrestricted submarine warfare in March 1917, which led to the United States&apos;s entry into the war the next month. Bethmann Hollweg, all credibility and power lost, remained in office until July that year, when a Reichstag revolt, resulting in the passage of the famous Peace Resolution by an alliance of the Social Democratic, Progressive, and Center parties, forced his resignation and replacement by the political nonentity Georg Michaelis. [ Later life ] Dr. von Bethmann Hollweg received prominent attention throughout the world in June 1919, when he formally asked the Allied and associated powers to place him on trial instead of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Supreme War Council decided to ignore his request. He was often mentioned as among those who might be tried by Allies for political offenses in connection with the origin of the war. In 1919 reports from Geneva said he was credited in diplomatic circles there as being at the bottom of the Monarchist movement in favor of both the Hohenzollern s and Habsburg s, the nucleus of which was said to be under way in Switzerland. Bethmann Hollweg spent the short remainder of his life in retirement, writing his memoirs. A little after Christmas 1920, he caught a cold which developed into acute pneumonia. He died from this illness on 1 January 1921. His wife died in 1914 and he lost his eldest son in the war. He was survived by a daughter, Countess Zeech, wife of the Secretary of the Russian Legation at Munich.
