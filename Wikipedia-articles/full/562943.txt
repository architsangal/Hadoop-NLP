Dermatology: 2-Volume Set Mosby St. Louis 2007 1-4160-2999-0 ] (also known as &quot; Drumstick fingers, &quot; &quot; Hippocratic fingers, &quot; and &quot; Watch-glass nails &quot; [ Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. Dermatology: 2-Volume Set Mosby St. Louis 2007 1-4160-2999-0 ] ) is a deformity of the finger s and fingernail s that is associated with a number of diseases, mostly of the heart and lungs. { Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick&apos;s Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0. } [ 656 ] Hippocrates was probably the first to document clubbing as a sign of disease, and the phenomenon is therefore occasionally called Hippocratic fingers. Idiopathic clubbing can also occur, and in 60% of cases there is no associated underlying disease.

Afr. Med. J. 50 9 297–300 1976 February 1265563 ] ) is a popular test for clubbing. When the distal phalanges (bones nearest the fingertips) of corresponding fingers of opposite hands are directly opposed (place fingernails of same finger on opposite hands against each other, nail to nail), a small diamond-shaped &quot; window &quot; is normally apparent between the nailbeds. If this window is obliterated, the test is positive and clubbing is present. [ Diagnosis ] When clubbing is encountered in patients, doctors will seek to identify its cause. They usually accomplish this by obtaining a medical history —particular attention is paid to lung, heart, and gastrointestinal conditions—and conducting a clinical examination, which may disclose associated features relevant to a diagnosis. Additional studies such as a chest X-ray and a chest CT-scan may also be performed. [ Disease associations ] Although many diseases are associated with clubbing (particularly lung diseases), the reports are fairly anecdotal. Prospective studies of patients presenting with clubbing have not yet been performed, and hence there is no conclusive evidence of these associations.

This is the combination of clubbing and thickening of periosteum (connective tissue lining of the bones) and synovium (lining of joints), and is often initially diagnosed as arthritis. It is commonly associated with lung cancer. [ Primary HOA ] Primary hypertrophic osteo-arthropathy is HPOA without signs of pulmonary disease. This form has a hereditary component, although subtle cardiac abnormalities can occasionally be found. It is known eponymously as the Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome. This condition has been linked to mutations in the gene on the fourth chromosome (4q33-q34) coding for the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD); this leads to decreased breakdown of prostaglandin E2 and elevated levels of this substance. [ Uppal S, Diggle CP, Carr IM, et al. Mutations in 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase cause primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy Nat. Genet. 40 6 789–93 2008 June 18500342 10.1038/ng.153 ] [ Pathophysiology ] The exact cause for sporadic clubbing is unknown, and there are numerous theories as to its cause. Vasodilation (distended blood vessels), secretion of growth factor s (such as platelet-derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor ) from the lungs, and other mechanisms have been proposed. The discovery of disorders in the prostaglandin metabolism in primary osteo-arthropathy has led to suggestions that overproduction of PGE2 by other tissues may be the causative factor for clubbing. [ Epidemiology ] The exact frequency of clubbing in the population is not known. A 2008 study found clubbing in 1% of all patients admitted to a department of internal medicine. Of these, 40% turned out to have significant underlying disease of various causes, while 60% had no medical problems on further investigations and remained well over the subsequent year.
