[ 3 11 08.3.01046 ] Cone cell structure Cone cells, or cones, are photoreceptor cell s in the retina of the eye that are responsible for color vision; they function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cell s that work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea, but quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. A commonly cited figure of six million in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. { G. Osterberg (1935). “Topography of the layer of rods and cones in the human retina,” Acta Ophthalmol., Suppl. 13:6, pp. 1–102. } Oyster&apos;s textbook (1999) [ The human eye: structure and function Oyster C. W. 1999 Sinauer Associates ] cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cell s in the human retina. [ Curcio CA. Sloan KR. Kalina RE. Hendrickson AE. Human photoreceptor topography. J Comp Neurol 292 4 497–523 Feb 1990 10.1002/cne.902920402 2324310 ] Cones are less sensitive to light than the rod cell s in the retina (which support vision at low light levels), but allow the perception of colour. They are also able to perceive finer detail and more rapid changes in images, because their response times to stimuli are faster than those of rods. [ E.R. Kandel Schwartz, J.H, and Jessell, T. M. 2000 Principles of Neural Science 4th 507–513 McGraw-Hill New York ] Because humans usually have three kinds of cones with different photopsin s, which have different response curves and thus respond to variation in colour in different ways, we have trichromatic vision. Being colour blind can change this, and there have been reports of people with four or more types of cones, giving them tetrachromat ic vision. [ 10.3758/BF03196159 Jameson, K. A., Highnote, S.

[ Types ] Humans normally have three kinds of cones. The first responds the most to light of long wavelengths, peaking at a reddish colour; this type is sometimes designated L for long. The second type responds the most to light of medium-wavelength, peaking at a green colour, and is abbreviated M for medium. The third type responds the most to short-wavelength light, of a bluish colour, and is designated S for short. The three types have peak wavelengths near 564–580 nm, 534–545  nm, and 420–440  nm, respectively. [ Günther Wyszecki Stiles, W.S. 1982 Colour Science: Concepts and Methods, Quantitative Data and Formulae 2nd Wiley Series in Pure and Applied Optics New York 0-471-02106-7 ] [ R. W. G. Hunt 2004 The Reproduction of Colour 6th 11–12 Wiley–IS &amp; T Series in Imaging Science and Technology Chichester UK 0-470-02425-9 ] The difference in the signals received from the three cone types allows the brain to perceive all possible colours, through the opponent process of colour vision. ( Rod cells have a peak sensitivity at 498  nm, roughly halfway between the peak sensitivities of the S and M cones.) All of the receptors contain the pigment photopsin, with variations in its conformation causing differences in the optimum wavelengths absorbed. The colour yellow, for example, is perceived when the L cones are stimulated slightly more than the M cones, and the colour red is perceived when the L cones are stimulated significantly more than the M cones. Similarly, blue and violet hues are perceived when the S receptor is stimulated more than the other two. The S cones are most sensitive to light at wavelengths around 420  nm. However, the lens and cornea of the human eye are increasingly absorptive to shorter wavelengths, and this sets the short wavelength limit of human-visible light to approximately 380  nm, which is therefore called &apos; ultraviolet &apos; light. People with aphakia, a condition where the eye lacks a lens, sometimes report the ability to see into the ultraviolet range. { &apos;&apos;Let the light shine in: You don&apos;t have to come from another planet to see ultraviolet light&apos;&apos; EducationGuardian.co.uk, David Hambling (May 30, 2002) } At moderate to bright light levels where the cones function, the eye is more sensitive to yellowish-green light than other colors because this stimulates the two most common (M and L) of the three kinds of cones almost equally. At lower light levels, where only the rod cell s function, the sensitivity is greatest at a blueish-green wavelength. Cones also tend to possess a significantly elevated visual acuity because each cone cell has a lone connection to the optic nerve, therefore, the cones have an easier time to tell that two stimuli are isolated. [ Structure ] { Bird, } { reptilian, and } { monotreme cone cells contain a coloured } { oil drop. } Cone cells are somewhat shorter than rods, but wider and tapered, and are much less numerous than rods in most parts of the retina, but greatly outnumber rods in the fovea. Structurally, cone cells have a cone -like shape at one end where a pigment filters incoming light, giving them their different response curves. They are typically 40–50 µm long, and their diameter varies from 0.5 to 4.0  µm, being smallest and most tightly packed at the center of the eye at the fovea. The S cones are a little larger than the others. [ June 2010 ] Photobleaching can be used to determine cone arrangement. This is done by exposing dark-adapted retina to a certain wavelength of light that paralyzes the particular type of cone sensitive to that wavelength for up to thirty minutes from being able to dark-adapt making it appear white in contrast to the grey dark-adapted cones when a picture of the retina is taken. The results illustrate that S cones are randomly placed and appear much less frequently than the M and L cones. The ratio of M and L cones varies greatly among different people with regular vision (e.g. values of 75.8% L with 20.0% M versus 50.6% L with 44.2% M in two male subjects). [ Roorda A., Williams D.R. 1999 The arrangement of the three cone classes in the living human eye Nature 397 6719 520–522 10028967 10.1038/17383 ] Like rods, each cone cell has a synaptic terminal, an inner segment, and an outer segment as well as an interior nucleus and various mitochondria. The synaptic terminal forms a synapse with a neuron such as a bipolar cell. The inner and outer segments are connected by a cilium. The inner segment contains organelle s and the cell&apos;s nucleus, while the outer segment, which is pointed toward the back of the eye, contains the light-absorbing materials. Like rods, the outer segments of cones have invaginations of their cell membrane s that create stacks of membranous disks. Photopigments exist as transmembrane protein s within these disks, which provide more surface area for light to affect the pigments. In cones, these disks are attached to the outer membrane, whereas they are pinched off and exist separately in rods. Neither rods nor cones divide, but their membranous disks wear out and are worn off at the end of the outer segment, to be consumed and recycled by phagocytic cells. The response of cone cells to light is also directionally nonuniform, peaking at a direction that receives light from the center of the pupil; this effect is known as the Stiles–Crawford effect. [ Related Diseases ] One of the diseases related to cone cells present in retina is Retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a rare, cancerous tumor of a part of the eye called the retina. Cancer of the retina common in children which is caused by the mutation of both copies of retinoblastoma genes (RB1)., the protein encoded by RB1 regulates a signal transduction pathway while controlling the cell cycle progression as normally. The scientists have come to a conclusion that retinoblastoma seems to originate in cone precursor cells present in the retina that consist of natural signalling networks which restrict cell death and promote cell survival after losing the RB1. It has been found that TRβ2 which is a transcription factor specifically affiliated with cones is essential for rapid reproduction and existence of the retinoblastoma cell.

Some of the symptoms include:-One or both eyes may be affected.-They pupil may appear white or have white spots. A white glow in the eye is often seen in photographs taken with a flash. Instead of the typical &quot; red eye &quot; from the flash, the pupil may appear white or distorted.Other symptoms can include:-Crossed eyes-Double vision-Eyes that do not align-Eye pain and redness-Poor vision-Differing iris colors in each eye If the cancer has spread, bone pain and other symptoms may occur.
