However, although &quot; Father Christmas &quot; and &quot; Santa Claus &quot; have for most practical purposes been merged, historically the characters have different origins and are not identical. [ April 2011 ] Some authors such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, [ April 2011 ] have insisted on the traditional form of Father Christmas in preference to Santa Claus. Father Christmas is often said to reside at the North Pole or less commonly, in the mountains of Korvatunturi in Lapland, Finland. [ History ] The earliest English examples of the personification of Christmas are apparently those in carols of the 15th century. [ April 2011 ] The manuscript Bodelian Library MS Arch. Selden b. 26, which dates from circa 1458 AD, { Stevens, John. &apos;Musica Britannica: Medieval Carols&apos;. Stainer and Bell LTD, 1970. } contains an anonymous Christmas carol (f. 8) which begins with the lyrics: Goday, goday, my lord Sire Christëmas, goday! Goday, Sire Christëmas, our king, for ev&apos;ry man, both old and ying, is glad and blithe of your coming; Goday! Similarly, a carol attributed to Richard Smert (c. 1400–c. 1479 [ http://www.hoasm.org/IVM/Smert.html Richard Smert HOASM 2011-04-01 ] ) in British Additional MS 5665 (ff. 8v-9v), begins in dialog form: Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell Who is there that singeth so: Nowell, nowell, nowell? I am here, Sire Christësmas. Welcome, my lord, Sire Christëmas! Welcome to us all, both more and less! Come near, Nowell. Both songs then proceed to proclaim the birth of Christ in the present tense and elaborate upon the story of the nativity as occasion for rejoicing. [ March 2012 ] The specific depiction of Christmas as a merry old man begins in the early 17th century, { Elizabethan satirist } { Thomas Nashe &apos;s play, } { Summer&apos;s Last Will and Testament (1592) includes a character personifying Christmas, but, in a passage criticizing the abandonment of traditional customs by wealthy gentry, this atypical &apos;Christmas&apos; refuses to offer the poor any good cheer.

[ March 2012 ] The earliest such was that in Ben Jonson &apos;s creation in Christmas his Masque { Christmas, His Masque - Ben Jonson } dating from December 1616, in which Christmas appears &quot; attir&apos;d in round Hose, long Stockings, a close Doublet, a high crownd Hat with a Broach, a long thin beard, a Truncheon, little Ruffes, white shoes, his Scarffes, and Garters tyed crosse &quot;, and announces &quot; Why Gentlemen, doe you know what you doe? ha! would you ha&apos;kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas? &quot; Later, in a masque by Thomas Nabbes, The Springs Glorie produced in 1638, &quot; Christmas &quot; appears as &quot; an old reverend gentleman in furred gown and cap &quot;. { Nabbes, Thomas, &quot; The Works of Thomas Nabbes &quot;, Benjamin Blom, Inc, New York, 1968 available online at Google Books } The character continued to appear over the next 250 years, appearing as Sir Christmas, Lord Christmas or Father Christmas, the last becoming the most common.

Father Christmas dates back at least as far as the 17th century in Britain, [ April 2011 ] and pictures of him survive from that era, portraying him as a well-nourished bearded man dressed in a long green fur-lined robe. A writer in &quot; Time&apos;s Telescope &quot; (1822) states that in Yorkshire at eight o&apos;clock on Christmas Eve the bells greet &quot; Old Father Christmas &quot; with a merry peal, the children parade the streets with drums, trumpets, bells, (or in their absence, with the poker and shovel, taken from their humble cottage fire), the yule candle is lighted, and; &quot; High on the cheerful fire.

L. Brett, ed., Barclay Fox&apos;s Journal, Bell and Hyman, London, 1979 } Father Christmas has gradually merged with the pre-modern gift giver St Nicholas (Dutch Sinterklaas, hence Santa Claus ) and associated folklore. Nowadays he is often called Santa Claus but also often referred to in Britain as Father Christmas: the two names are synonyms. In Europe, Father Christmas/Santa Claus is often said to reside in the mountains of Korvatunturi in Lapland Province, Finland. Traditionally, [ April 2011 ] Father Christmas comes down the chimney to put presents under the Christmas tree or in children&apos;s rooms, in their stockings. Some families leave a glass of sherry or mulled wine, mince pies, biscuits, or chocolate and a carrot for his reindeer near the stocking(s) as a present for him. In modern homes without chimneys he uses alternative means to enter the home. In some homes children write Christmas lists (of wished-for presents) and send them up the chimney or post them. [ Appearance ] { Santa Claus. } Father Christmas often appears as a large man, often around 70 years old. He is dressed in a red or green suit trimmed with white fur, often girdled with a wide black belt, a matching hat, often long and floppy in nature, and dark boots.
