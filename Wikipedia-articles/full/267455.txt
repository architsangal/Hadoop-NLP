[ the canal builder Sir Nigel Gresley, 6th Baronet the A4-class locomotive named after the designer LNER Class A4 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley ] [ H N Gresley.jpg 200 Herbert Nigel Gresley British 19 June 1876 Edinburgh 5 April 1941 Locomotive engineer Great Northern Railway, London and North Eastern Railway ] Sir Herbert Nigel Gresley (19 June 1876 – 5 April 1941) { biography accessed 15 November 2007 } was one of Britain&apos;s most famous steam locomotive engineers, who rose to become Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). He was the designer of some of the most famous steam locomotives in Britain, including the LNER Class A1 and LNER Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific engines. An A1, Flying Scotsman, was the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100  mph in passenger service, and an A4, number 4468 Mallard, still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world (126  mph). Gresley&apos;s engines were considered elegant, both aesthetically and mechanically. His invention of a three-cylinder design with only two sets of Walschaerts valve gear, the Gresley conjugated valve gear, produced smooth running and power at lower cost than would have been achieved with a more conventional three sets of Walschaerts gear. &apos;Flying Scotsman&apos;&apos; [ Biography ] Salisbury Hall, Gresley&apos;s home during the 1930s Memorial plaque to Gresley&apos;s achievements displayed in the main hall of Edinburgh&apos;s Waverley railway station Gresley was born in Edinburgh (due to his mother&apos;s ante-natal complications), but was raised in Netherseal, Derbyshire, a member of the cadet branch of a family long seated at Gresley, Derbyshire. After attending school in Sussex and at Marlborough College, Gresley served his apprenticeship at the Crewe works of the London and North Western Railway, afterwards becoming a pupil under John Aspinall at Horwich of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L &amp; YR). After several minor appointments with the L &amp; YR he was made Outdoor Assistant in the Carriage and Wagon Department in 1901; in 1902 he was appointed Assistant Works Manager at Newton Heath depot, and Works Manager the following year. This rapid rise in his career was maintained for, in 1904, he became Assistant Superintendent of the Carriage and Wagon Department of the L &amp; YR. A year later, he moved to the Great Northern Railway (GNR) as Carriage and Wagon Superintendent. He succeeded Henry A. Ivatt as CME of the GNR on 1 October 1911. At the 1923 Grouping, he was appointed CME of the newly formed LNER (the post had originally been offered to the ageing John G. Robinson; Robinson declined and suggested the much younger Gresley). In 1936, Gresley was awarded an honorary DSc by Manchester University and a knighthood by King Edward VIII; [ 34307 4669 21 July 1936 25 January 2010 ] also in that year he presided over the IMechE. During the 1930s, Sir Nigel Gresley lived at Salisbury Hall, near St. Albans in Hertfordshire. In the moat, Gresley developed an interest in breeding wild birds and ducks, intriguingly amongst the species were Mallard ducks! { Don Hale, Mallard, Aurum Press, 2005, ISBN 1-85410-939-1 pages 51-52 } The Hall still exists today as the home of the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre. In 1936, Gresley designed the 1,500V DC locomotives for the proposed electrification of the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield. The Second World War forced the postponement of the project, which was completed in the early 1950s. Gresley died after a short illness on 5 April 1941 and was buried in Netherseal, Derbyshire. He was succeeded as the LNER CME by Edward Thompson. A memorial plaque to Gresley&apos;s achievements was unveiled at Edinburgh Waverley railway station in 2001. It was created by the Gresley Society and incorporates line drawings of his &quot; Flying Scotsman &quot; and &quot; Mallard &quot; locomotives.
