[ 1995 11 10 1941 10 10 ] { Executed } { Ogoni } { Author, activist } { Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People } { Right Livelihood Award } { Goldman Environmental Prize } Kenule &quot; Ken &quot; Beeson Saro Wiwa (October 10, 1941 – November 10, 1995) was a Nigeria n author, television producer, environmental activist, and winner of the Right Livelihood Award and the Goldman Environmental Prize. Saro-Wiwa was a member of the Ogoni people, an ethnic minority in Nigeria whose homeland, Ogoniland, in the Niger Delta has been targeted for crude oil extraction since the 1950s and which has suffered extreme and unremediated environmental damage from decades of indiscriminate petroleum waste dumping. Initially as spokesperson, and then as President, of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Saro-Wiwa led a nonviolent campaign against environmental degradation of the land and waters of Ogoniland by the operations of the multinational petroleum industry, especially the Royal Dutch Shell company. He was also an outspoken critic of the Nigerian government, which he viewed as reluctant to enforce environmental regulations on the foreign petroleum companies operating in the area. At the peak of his non-violent campaign, Saro-Wiwa was arrested, hastily tried by a special military tribunal, and hanged in 1995 by the military government of General Sani Abacha, all on charges widely viewed as entirely politically motivated and completely unfounded. His execution provoked international outrage and resulted in Nigeria&apos;s suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations for over three years. [ Biography ] [ Early life ] A son of Ogoni chieftain Jim Wiwa, Ken was born in Bori, in the Niger Delta. { Hamilton, Janice. Nigeria in Pictures. Page 71 } He spent his childhood in an Anglican home and eventually proved himself to be an excellent student; he attended Secondary School at Government College Umuahia and on completion obtained a scholarship to study English at the University of Ibadan and briefly became a teaching assistant at the University of Lagos.

His best known novel, Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English, tells the story of a naive village boy recruited to the army during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 to 1970, and intimates the political corruption and patronage in Nigeria&apos;s military regime of the time. His war diaries, On a Darkling Plain, document Saro-Wiwa&apos;s experience during the war. Saro-Wiwa was also a successful businessman and television producer. His satirical television series, Basi &amp; Co. was wildly popular, with an estimated audience of 30 million Nigerians. [ Brooke James Enugu Journal; 30 Million Nigerians are Laughing at Themselves http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/24/world/enugu-journal-30-million-nigerians-are-laughing-at-themselves.html?pagewanted%3Dall%26amp%3Bsrc%3Dpm The New York Times July 24, 1987 ] In the early 1970s Saro-Wiwa served as the Regional Commissioner for Education in the Rivers State Cabinet, but was dismissed in 1973 because of his support for Ogoni autonomy. In the late 1970s, he established a number of successful business ventures in retail and real-estate, and during the 1980s concentrated primarily on his writing, journalism and television production, His intellectual work was interrupted in 1987 when he re-entered the political scene, appointed by the newly installed dictator Ibrahim Babangida to aid the country&apos;s transition to democracy. But Ken soon resigned because he felt Babangida&apos;s supposed plans for a return to democracy were disingenuous. Ken&apos;s sentiments were proven correct in the coming years, as Babangida failed to relinquish power. In 1993, Babangida annulled Nigeria&apos;s general elections which would transfer power to a civilian government, sparking mass civil unrest and eventually forcing him to step-down, at least officially, in the same year. [ November 2009 ] [ Activism ] In 1990, Saro-Wiwa began devoting most of his time to human rights and environmental causes, particularly in Ogoniland. He was one of the earliest members of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), which advocated for the rights of the Ogoni people. The Ogoni Bill of Rights, written by MOSOP, set out the movement&apos;s demands, including increased autonomy for the Ogoni people, a fair share of the proceeds of oil extraction, and remediation of environmental damage to Ogoni lands. In particular, MOSOP struggled against the degradation of Ogoni lands by Shell oil company. [ http://wiwavshell.org/about/about-wiwa-v-shell/ About Wiwa v. Shell Wiwa family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell 10 November 2011 ] In 1992, Saro-Wiwa was imprisoned for several months, without trial, by the Nigerian military government. Saro-Wiwa was Vice Chair of Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) General Assembly from 1993 to 1995. [ http://www.unpo.org/article/11820 Clean the Niger Delta – “We all stand before history” Ken Saro-Wiwa 1995 19 October 2010 UNPO 10 November 2011 ] UNPO is an international, nonviolent, and democratic organization (of which MOSOP is a member). Its members are indigenous peoples, minorities, and unrecognised or occupied territories who have joined together to protect and promote their human and cultural rights, to preserve their environments and to find nonviolent solutions to conflicts which affect them. In January 1993, MOSOP organized peaceful marches of around 300,000 Ogoni people – more than half of the Ogoni population – through four Ogoni centers, drawing international attention to his people&apos;s plight. The same year the Nigerian government occupied the region militarily. [ Arrest and execution ] Saro-Wiwa was arrested again and detained by Nigerian authorities in June 1993, but was released after a month. [ November 2011 ] On May 21, 1994 four Ogoni chiefs (all on the conservative side of a schism within MOSOP over strategy) were brutally murdered. Saro-Wiwa had been denied entry to Ogoniland on the day of the murders, but he was arrested and accused of incitement to them. Saro-Wiwa denied the charges, but was imprisoned for over a year before being found guilty and sentenced to death by a specially convened tribunal. The same happened to other MOSOP leaders ( Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine ).

The resignations left the defendants to their own means against the tribunal, which continued to bring witnesses to testify against Saro-Wiwa and his peers. Many of these supposed witnesses later admitted that they had been bribe d by the Nigerian government to support the criminal allegations. At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony – in the presence of Shell’s lawyer.

[ http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/160 Ken Saro-Wiwa The Goldman Environmental Prize 1995 November 14, 2011 ] Very few observers were surprised when the tribunal declared a &quot; guilty &quot; verdict, but most were shocked that the penalty would be death by hanging for all nine defendants. Many were skeptical that the punishments would actually occur, as the Nigerian government would face international outrage and possible sanctions and other legal action should the penalties be carried out. But on 10 November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and eight other MOSOP leaders (the &quot; Ogoni Nine &quot; ) were killed by hanging at the hands of military personnel. According to most accounts, Saro-Wiwa was the last person to be hanged and so was forced to watch the death of his colleagues. Information on the circumstances of Saro-Wiwa&apos;s own death are unclear, but it is generally agreed that multiple attempts were required before Saro-Wiwa died. [ August 2007 ]. In his satirical piece Africa Kills Her Sun first published in 1989, Saro-Wiwa correctly foreshadowed his execution in a resigned, melancholic mood. { &apos;Africa Kills Her Sun&apos; (Short Story Series, Revised Edition) | http://www.enotes.com/africa-kills-her-sun-salem/africa-kills-her-sun } { &apos;Africa Kills Her Sun&apos; Author: Ken Saro-Wiwa | http://ngishili.com/?p=365 } This came to pass few years later on November 10, 1995 when he was hanged by the then military rule (just like he had written). His death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations as well as the calling back of many foreign diplomats for consultation. The United States and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions on Nigeria because of its government&apos;s actions. A memorial to Saro-Wiwa was unveiled in London on 10 November 2006.

It toured the UK the following year. [ Family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell ] [ Wiwa family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell ] Beginning in 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), EarthRights International (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris &amp; Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation. { for more info see } The cases were brought under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 statute giving non-U.S. citizens the right to file suits in U.S. courts for international human rights violations, and the Torture Victim Protection Act, which allows individuals to seek damages in the U.S. for torture or extrajudicial killing, regardless of where the violations take place. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On June 9, 2009 Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $15.5 million USD to victims&apos; families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process. [ Shell settles Nigeria deaths case BBC 2009-06-09 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8090493.stm 2009-06-09 ] In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, in order to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.

[ Biographies ] A biography, In the Shadow of a Saint: A Son&apos;s Journey to Understanding His Father&apos;s Legacy, was written by his son, journalist Ken Wiwa. Published in September 2005, shortly before the tenth anniversary of Saro-Wiwa&apos;s execution, Canadian author J. Timothy Hunt &apos;s The Politics of Bones documented the flight of Ken&apos;s brother Owens Wiwa, after his brother&apos;s execution and his own imminent arrest, to London and then on to Canada, where he is now a citizen and continues his brother&apos;s fight on behalf of the Ogoni people. Moreover, it is also the story of Owens&apos; personal battle against the Nigerian government to locate his brother&apos;s remains after they were buried in an unmarked mass-grave. Ken Saro-Wiwa&apos;s own diary, A Month and a Day: A Detention Diary was published in January 1995, two months after his execution. A book of essays about Wiwa entitled Before I Am Hanged: Ken Saro-Wiwa, Literature, Politics, and Dissent was published by Africa World Press in December 1999. More information on the struggles of the Ogoni people can be found in the book Ogoni&apos;s Agonies: Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Crisis in Nigeria.
