[ October 2008 ] A 527 organization or 527 group is a type of American tax-exempt organization named after Section 527 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code ( [ 26 527 ] ). A 527 group is created primarily to influence the selection, nomination, election, appointment or defeat of candidates to federal, state or local public office. Technically, almost all political committees, including state, local, and federal candidate committees, traditional political action committees, &quot; Super PACs &quot;, and political parties are &quot; 527s. &quot; However, in common practice the term is usually applied only to such organizations that are not regulated under state or federal campaign finance laws because they do not &quot; expressly advocate &quot; for the election or defeat of a candidate or party. When operated within the law, there are no upper limits on contributions to 527s and no restrictions on who may contribute. There are no spending limits imposed on these organizations; however, they must register with the IRS, publicly disclose their donors and file periodic reports of contributions and expenditures. { The Center for Public Integrity, 527 Frequently Asked Questions http://projects.publicintegrity.org/527/default.aspx?act=faq#5 } Because they may not advocate for specific candidates or coordinate with the candidate’s campaign, many 527s are run by interest groups and used to raise money to spend on issue advocacy and voter mobilization outside of the restrictions on PACs. Examples of 527s include American Solutions for Winning the Future, EMILY&apos;s List, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, Texans for Truth, The Media Fund, America Coming Together, the Progress for America Voter Fund, Secretary of State Project, United American Technologies, American Right To Life Action and the November Fund. MoveOn.org was previously a 527, until they decided to shut down their 527 group as a result of &quot; new politics offered by Barack Obama &quot;. { MoveOn To Close Its 527 In Response To Obama&apos;s Candidacy, talkingpointsmemo.com } [ Legal history ] The line between interest and express advocacy was the source of heated debate and litigation. Prior to the passage of the McCain-Feingold law, also known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, it was generally accepted that 527s were not covered by campaign finance laws. McCain-Feingold specifically extended certain campaign finance limitations to 527s running ads within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary election. Based on the Supreme Court&apos;s decision in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, upholding the McCain-Feingold law, many persons urged the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to use its regulatory power to extend campaign finance laws to cover these groups. The Commission held hearings in April 2004 to determine whether or not 527s should be regulated under campaign finance rules, but concluded that the law did not cover these independent 527 organizations unless they directly advocated the election or defeat of a candidate or engaged in advertising within the 30 and 60 day windows specified by Congress in the McCain-Feingold law. Federal Election Commission rulings after the 2004 election put advertisements which questioned a candidate’s character and fitness for office off limits to 527s specifically.

Federal Election Commission SCOTUSblog April 1, 2012 ] In January 2010, the Supreme Court held that the government may not keep corporations or unions from spending money to support or denounce individual candidates in elections. While corporations or unions may not give money directly to campaigns, they may seek to persuade the voting public through independent expenditure groups. [ http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php?cycle%3D2010 Super PACs OpenSecrets April 1, 2012 ] In July 2010, the Supreme Court ruling in Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission created independent expenditure -only committees known as Super PACs which, like 527s, can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, unions, associations and corporations to influence elections. These PACs must also disclose their finances to the FEC and cannot coordinate with candidates or political parties. The difference is that they may directly advocate for or against a candidate. [ Current litigation ] Carey et al. v. FEC – RADM James J. Carey, USN (ret), chairman of the National Defense PAC, along with the PAC and a prospective donor, brought suit after the FEC deadlocked on a 2010 Advisory Opinion Request (see AO 2010-20), in which the PAC sought permission to operate a &quot; Super-Duper &quot; PAC, combining an independent expenditure-only PAC and PAC that makes direct contributions to candidates as a single entity for FEC purposes.

The heavy spending of key 527 groups to attack presidential candidates brought complaints to the Federal Elections Commission of illegal coordination between the groups and rival political campaigns. These formal complaints included: On May 5, 2004, the Republican National Committee accused MoveOn.org, The Media Fund, America Coming Together and America Votes of coordinating their efforts with the John Kerry campaign. On August 20, 2004, John Kerry&apos;s campaign accused Swift Boat Veterans for Truth of coordinating their efforts with the George W. Bush campaign. Several people who were involved with both organizations removed themselves to avoid the appearance of conflict. Attorney Benjamin Ginsberg pointed out that it was not uncommon or illegal for lawyers to represent campaigns or political parties while also representing 527 groups. For example, Washington attorney Joe Sandler simultaneously represented the Democratic National Committee and a 527 group airing anti-Bush ads, the MoveOn.org Voter Fund. In 2006 and 2007 the FEC fined a number of organizations, including MoveOn and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, for violations arising from the 2004 campaign. The FEC&apos;s rationale was that these groups had specifically advocated the election or defeat of candidates, thus making them subject to federal regulation and its limits on contributions to the organizations.
