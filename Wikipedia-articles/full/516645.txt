IBM, Honeywell, Control Data and other companies had facilities in the state. In 1963, their presence inspired a group of teachers at the University of Minnesota College of Education &apos;s laboratory school to introduce computers into classrooms via teleprinter s and time-sharing. The group began with long-distance calls to Dartmouth College &apos;s General Electric computer to use John George Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz &apos;s new Dartmouth BASIC language, then moved to Minneapolis -based Pillsbury Company &apos;s own GE computer. In 1968, 20 Minneapolis-Saint Paul area school districts and the College of Education founded Total Information for Educational Systems (TIES) to provide time-sharing service on a HP 2000, training, and software. The presence of computer-company employees on many school boards accelerated TIES&apos;s expansion and helped make Minnesota a leader in computer-based education.

As a Joint Powers Authority, with the support of the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System, and the Minnesota Department of Education, [ Mace Scott Minnesota&apos;s MECC educates next generation of computer users http://books.google.com/books?id%3DgT0EAAAAMBAJ%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA9%26amp%3Bdq%3D%22mecc%22%20catalog%20apple%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA9#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 2011-01-20 InfoWorld 1981-12-07 ] MECC&apos;s role was to study and coordinate computer use in schools for both administrative and educational purposes. Schools, including the universities, had to get MECC&apos;s approval for most computing expenses, and were also its customers for computer-related services. After study of educational needs, a single educational computer center in the Minneapolis area was recommended for use by schools throughout the state [ lafrenz19950413 ] (the University of Minnesota&apos;s MERITSS computer provided time-sharing services to its campuses and to state universities).

A sturdy industrial building originally used for electrical maintenance, part of the building was already occupied by the University of Minnesota&apos;s Lauderdale computing facility. SUMITS was a batch processing system, however, not time-sharing, and its performance failed to meet the terms of the contract. In 1977 it was replaced with a Control Data Corporation Cyber 73 mainframe, [ lafrenz19950413 ] known as the MECC Timesharing System (MTS). It became the largest such system for education in the world, with up to 448 simultaneous connections [ ota1982 ] [ 214 ] from up to 2000 [ ota1982 ] [ 216 ] terminals throughout the state, most of them ASR33 teleprinters, connected at 110 and 300 baud through telephones by using acoustically coupled modem s. After several years most of the phone lines were replaced with direct circuits to schools across the state. By 1982 MTS had more than 950 programs in its library. [ ota1982 ] [ 218 ] One of the most popular was The Oregon Trail, originally written for the Minneapolis Public Schools&apos; computer. [ lussenhop20110119 ] Programming was the largest single use for MTS, with up to 45% of the system used for one of almost one dozen computer languages. [ ota1982 ] [ 217 ] To support its larger number of users —70 to 80% of all Minnesota public schools in 1981, [ mace19811207 ] and available to 96% of Minnesota students from 7 am to 11 pm daily by 1982 [ Informational technology and its impact on American education Office of Technology Assessment http://books.google.com/books?id%3Dmi1hy_DYW_kC%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA218%26amp%3Bdq%3Dmecc%20apple%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA214#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dmecc%20apple%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 1982 United States Government Printing Office ] [ 214 ] —primarily using programs written in the BASIC [ lafrenz19950413 ] [ MECC Quick Reference Guide for BASIC Language Version 3.1 Former MECC User http://www.peternelson.com/photos/albums//2008_01_MECC_QuickRef/Minnesota%20Educational%20Computing%20Consortium%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide%20for%20BASIC%20Language%20Version%203.1%20MECC%20TIMESHARE%20SYSTEM%20Rev.%202%20slash%2078.pdf 2008-01-28 ] language, both timesharing systems developed shared memory (MULTI) BASIC systems. Through this and less efficient methods, multiuser programs and chat systems appeared in addition to electronic mail and BBS programs; some of these were derived from MERITSS programs.

The MERITSS chat program, even though it operated via fast access system files, could not match the efficiency of a MULTI chat program that copied the input/output into memory to be delivered to the user. The University of Minnesota Computer Center (UCC as it was called then) rejected implementing MULTI due to concerns about system stability. UCC tried to retrofit the MULTI-mail program for its own use because of the good user interface. It was not possible. They then tried again with an older fast access system file version, and while it worked, it was unreliable. After doing test runs with several other Universities mail programs, two developers at UCC implemented their own version, which also contained a message board feature, and was the campus wide e-mail solution for a couple of years. [ Microcomputer technology ] As MECC&apos;s Cyber 73 entered into service, microcomputers began to appear. In 1978 it appeared that features wished for in the classroom, such as a graphical display, [ lafrenz19950413 ] were available. Through an evaluation and bidding process, the Apple II was chosen by MECC for state schools over other candidates, such as the Radio Shack TRS-80; the win was an important early deal in the history of Apple Inc. [ lussenhop20110119 ] Any school in the state could buy Apple computers through MECC for a substantial discount [ mace19811207 ] without having to go through complex evaluation and purchasing procedures. Through this &quot; enviable showcase &quot; Apple sold more than 2,000 computers during the next three years, [ Freiberger Paul Atari and MECC reach an agreement http://books.google.com/books?id%3DZD0EAAAAMBAJ%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA4%26amp%3Bdq%3Dmecc%20apple%20atari%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA1#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dmecc%20apple%20atari%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse 2011-01-22 InfoWorld 1981-11-02 ] making MECC&apos;s the company&apos;s largest reseller. [ lafrenz19950413 ] In late 1981 MECC switched to a discount agreement for the Atari 400 and 800. [ freiberger19811102 ] The use of microcomputers quickly increased, with 85% of school districts using them by 1981 compared to 75% for time-sharing, [ ota1982 ] [ 217 ] and the Cyber 73 shut down in 1983. MECC developed hundreds of microcomputer educational programs, [ lussenhop20110119 ] many converted from the time-sharing original; [ lafrenz19950413 ] by 1979 some MECC programs for the Apple II could be downloaded from the timesharing system. MECC distributed The Oregon Trail and others in its library to Minnesota schools for free, and charged others $10 to $20 for diskettes, each containing several programs.

As the state of Minnesota did not have the capital to fund such plans, it spun off the company as a private corporation in 1991 to the venture capital fund North American Fund II [ lafrenz19950413 ] { MECC Timeline http://web.archive.org/web/20090810141841/geocities.com/meccalumni/Timeline902.html } for $5.25 million.
