Lippincott Company. } Moodus was home to about a dozen textile mills and associated factories during much of its history, and the most successful was Brownell &amp; Company. Moodus was in an ideal location for textile production since it had access to ample water power and shipping (via the Connecticut River and the Connecticut Valley Railroad { http://www.essexsteamtrain.com/history.html } ), and it was close to an enormous trading center and market, New York City. Moodus&apos;s mills primarily manufactured cotton yarn, duck, and twine, and that production lasted from 1819 to 1977. The mills also produced certain related products, particularly fishing nets and pearl buttons. A part of that textile mill history is preserved in the Johnsville historical section of Moodus, named after one of the mill owners. Brownell was a pioneer with DuPont Corporation in the production of nylon products, and Brownell still manufacturers specialized textile-related products in Moodus such as archery bowstrings, helicopter cargo nets, and tennis nets. { http://www.brownellarchery.com/BrownellCoverStory.pdf } [ http://connecticutwatertrails.com/CWTA%20-%20Resources%20-%20History%20Of%20Connecticut%27s%20Water%20Trails%20-%20History%20of%20Mills%20-%20East%20Haddam.htm History of Mills In Connecticut Connecticut Water Trails Association 2012-02-26 ] Moodus is known for many local resorts that operated over the course of the early and mid twentieth century. Almost exactly between Boston and New York, the village drew guests from both cities who were enchanted by its rural atmosphere. One of the last resorts to remain in operation, Sunrise Resort, was purchased by the state of Connecticut in late 2008 to be incorporated into the adjacent Machimoodus State Park as a campground, and to protect &quot; 4,700 feet of additional frontage along the Salmon River. &quot; { Church, Diane (January 3, 2009) &quot; Sunrise Resort bought by state, open to public &quot; The Herald Press, archive here by Freezepage } The quaint village center, dubbed &quot; Downtown Moodus &quot;, formerly located at the intersection of routes CT 151 and CT 149, was a popular destination for guests. However most of the village was razed after the citizens of East Haddam controversially voted in 1967 to accept urban renewal funding to build a new commercial district for Moodus a quarter mile east, along CT 149. East Haddam was one of the smallest towns in the United States to participate in the urban renewal program. { &quot; Legacy of &quot; Progress &quot; Gone Sour &quot; SimonPure Productions, LLC } [ Demographics ] As of the census [ 2 ] of 2000, there were 1,263 people, 529 households, and 322 families residing in the CDP.

And Ritchie, David (2007) &quot; acoustics &quot; Encyclopedia of Earthquakes and Volcanoes Facts on File, New York, page 1, ISBN 978-0-8160-6302-4 } and are attributed to shallow micro-earthquakes. { &quot; Seismic Detective Solves &apos;Moodus Noises&apos; Mystery &quot; } { Hartford Courant October 19, 1981 } { Ebel, John E.

(2009) &quot; The Moodus Noises &amp; Moodus Noise Cave &quot; } In Legendary Connecticut, author David Philips asserts that the Moodus noises were the source of an indigenous religious cult important to local Native Americans. Local Algonquin chiefs ( Sachems ) would gather around Mt. Tom in order to experience the living presence of the god Hobomock. Pequot, Mohegan and Narragansett tribes participated in this cult, and according to local Alison Guinness, the Wangunks were involved as well. The Algonquins called the area Matchemadoset or Matchitmoodus, meaning &quot; the Place of Bad Noises, &quot; since Hobomock was considered an evil deity. { Philips, David E. (1992) Legendary Connecticut: Traditional Tales from the Nutmeg State (2nd edition) Curbstone Books, Willimantic, Connecticut, page ?, ISBN 1-880684-05-5 } The Moodus noises were the basis for the otherworldly noises in H. P. Lovecraft &apos;s The Dunwich Horror. [ Lovecraft Howard Phillips The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Stories 2001 Penguin Books S. T.
