[ May 2012 ] [ Purpose of protests and church actions ] In the BBC documentary The Most Hated Family in America, filmmaker Louis Theroux questioned Shirley Phelps-Roper as to whether she had considered that Westboro&apos;s technique of protests were more likely to &quot; put people off the Word of Jesus Christ and the Bible &quot;. In response, Phelps-Roper said as to the purpose of the protests, &quot; You think our job is to win souls to Christ. All we do, by getting in their face and putting these signs in front of them and these plain words, is make what&apos;s already in their heart come out of their mouth. &quot; [ Theroux, Louis The Most Hated Family in America http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000764/ Television documentary BBC 2007 ] Later in the documentary, Phelps-Roper agrees that the $200,000 the church annually spends to fly to funerals to protest was money spent to spread &quot; God&apos;s hate &quot;. [ Views on homosexuality ] The church runs numerous Web sites such as GodHatesFags.com, GodHatesAmerica.com and others expressing condemnation of homosexuality. The group bases its work around the belief expressed by its best known slogan and the address of its primary Web site, God Hates Fags, asserting that every tragedy in the world is linked to homosexualityâspecifically society&apos;s increasing tolerance and acceptance of the so-called homosexual agenda. The group maintains that God hates gays above all other kinds of &quot; sinners &quot; { &quot; Westboro Baptist Church FAQ &quot;. } and that homosexuality should be a capital crime. { &quot; Outlaw Sodomy &quot;, December 3, 2002 } Their views on homosexuality are partially based on teachings found in the Old Testament, specifically Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, which they interpret to mean that homosexual behavior is detestable, and that homosexuals should be put to death, respectively. [ Views on religions ] [ Catholicism ] Westboro Baptist refers to Catholic priests as &quot; vampire s &quot; and &quot; Dracula s &quot; and talks of Catholic priests sucking semen out of male children&apos;s genitals like vampires suck blood from their victims. In addition, WBC calls Pope Benedict XVI such epithet s as &quot; The Godfather of Pedophile s &quot; and &quot; Pervert Pope &quot;.

[ Protestantism ] Though the main purpose of the Priests Rape Boys website is to criticize Catholicism, the WBC also criticizes several mainline Protestant churches on the website, including Methodists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Baptists. The WBC states that [...their preachers have shirked their responsibility to tell people the truth about sin, and instead lie to them about what the Lord their God doth require of them.

The WBC criticizes the Eastern Orthodox Church &apos;s use of icons, claiming that they constitute idolatry. The WBC also criticizes veneration of the Virgin Mary, the Theotokos, saying, &quot; There is no scripture that supports bowing down to kiss images... or praying to Mary!

She also commented that &quot; all those angry little Muslims can just shut their mouths. &quot; { America&apos;s Most Hated Family in Crisis } [ Hinduism ] The WBC maintains a God Hates India webpage where they state &quot; 80% of India&apos;s population claim to practice Hinduism.
