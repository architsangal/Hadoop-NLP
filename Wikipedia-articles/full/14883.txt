It is the westernmost of the three major southern European peninsulas—the Iberian, Italian, and Balkan peninsulas. It is bordered on the southeast and east by the Mediterranean Sea, and on the north, west and southwest by the Atlantic Ocean. The Pyrenees form the northeast edge of the peninsula, separating it from the rest of Europe. In the south, it approaches the northern coast of Africa. It is the second-largest peninsula in Europe, with an area of approximately [ 582000 km2 sqmi on ]. [ Name ] [ Greek name ] The English word Iberia was adapted from the use of the Ancient Greek word Ιβηρία (Ibēría) by the Greek geographers under the Roman Empire to refer to what is known today in English as the Iberian Peninsula. { First known use in that sense dates to 1618. } [ Online Etymological Dictionary Iberian http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l%3Di ] At that time the name did not describe a single political entity or a distinct population of people. [ Strabo Strabo Geographica Book III Chapter 1 Section 6 And also the other Iberians use an alphabet, though not letters of one and the same character, for their speech is not one and the same. ] Strabo&apos;s Iberia was delineated from Keltikē by the Pyrenees and included the entire land mass south-west (he named it &quot; west &quot; ) of there. The ancient Greeks discovered the Iberian peninsula by voyaging westward. Hecataeus of Miletus was the first known to use the term around 500 BC. [ Strabo Strabo Horace Leonard Jones, Translator The Geography II MCMLXXXVIII Harvard University Press Cambridge ancient Greek, English 118, Note 1 on 3.4.19 ] Herodotus of Halicarnassus says of the Phocaea ns that &quot; it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with... Iberia. &quot; { I.163. } According to Strabo { III.4.19. } prior historians used Iberia to mean the country &quot; this side of the Ἶβηρος (Ibēros) &quot; as far north as the Rhone river in France but currently they set the Pyrenees as the limit. Polybius respects that limit { III.37. } but identifies Iberia as the Mediterranean side as far south as Gibraltar, with the Atlantic side having no name. Elsewhere { III.17. } he says that Saguntum is &quot; on the seaward foot of the range of hills connecting Iberia and Celtiberia. &quot; Strabo { III.4.11. } refers to the Carretanians as people &quot; of the Iberian stock &quot; living in the Pyrenees, who are to be distinguished from either Celts or Celtiberians. [ Roman names ] [ Hispania ] When the Romans encountered the Greek geographers they used Iberia poetically [ September 2011 ] and spoke of the Iberi. [ Iberia, Iberi Félix Gaffiot&apos;s Dictionnaire Illustré Latin Français Librairie Hachette 1934 ] First mention was in 200 BC by the poet Quintus Ennius. The Romans had already had independent experience with the peoples on the peninsula during the long conflict with Carthage. The Roman geographers and other prose writers from the time of the late Roman Republic called the entire peninsula Hispania. As they became politically interested in the former territories of Carthage, the Romans came to use Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior for &apos;near&apos; and &apos;far Spain&apos;. Even at that time large sections of it were Lusitania ( Portugal south of Douro river and Extremadura in western Spain), Gallaecia ( Northern Portugal and Galicia in Spain), Celtiberia (central Spain), Baetica ( Andalusia ), Cantabria (northwest Spain) and the Vascones ( Basques ). Strabo says that the Romans use Hispania and Iberia synonymously, and distance them as near and far. He was living in a time when the peninsula was divided into Roman provinces, of which Baetia was supervised by the Senate, whereas the others were governed on behalf of the Emperor. Whatever language may have been spoken on the peninsula soon gave way to Latin, except for Basque, protected by the Pyrenees}} [ Etymology ] { Huesca. } The Iberian Peninsula has always been associated with the Ebro river, Ibēros in ancient Greek and Ibērus or Hibērus in Latin. The association was so well known it was hardly necessary to state; for example, Ibēria was the country &quot; this side of the Ibērus &quot; in Strabo. Pliny goes so far as to assert that the Greeks had called &quot; the whole of Spain &quot; Hiberia because of the river Hiberus. { III.3.21. } The river appears in the Ebro Treaty of 226 BC between Rome and Carthage, setting the limit of Carthaginian interest at the Ebro. The fullest description of the treaty, stated in Appian, [ Horace White Jona Lendering Appian&apos;s History of Rome: The Spanish Wars (§§6-10) http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_spain_02.html#%A77 livius.org 2008-12-01 Chapter 7 ] uses Ibērus. With reference to this border, Polybius [ Polybius: The Histories: III.6.2 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/3%2A.html Bill Thayer ] states that the &quot; native name &quot; is Ibēr, apparently the original word, stripped of its Greek or Latin -os or -us termination. The early range of these natives, stated by the geographers and historians to be from southern Spain to southern France along the Mediterranean coast, is marked by instances of a readable script expressing a yet unknown language, dubbed &apos; Iberian &apos;. Whether this was the native name or was given to them by the Greeks for their residence on the Ebro remains unknown. Credence in Polybius imposes certain limitations on etymologizing: if the language remains unknown, the meanings of the words, including Iber, must remain unknown also. [ Prehistory ] [ Prehistoric Iberia ] Schematic rock art from the Iberian peninsula. Iberian Late Bronze Age since c. 1300 BC [ Palaeolithic ] The Iberian Peninsula has been inhabited for at least 1,000,000 years as remains found in the sites at Atapuerca demonstrate. Among these sites is the cave of Gran Dolina, where six hominin skeletons, dated between 780,000 and one million years ago, were found in 1994. Experts have debated whether these skeletons belong to the species Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, or a new species called Homo antecessor. Around 200,000 BC, during the Lower Paleolithic period, Neanderthals first entered the Iberian Peninsula. Around 70,000 BC, during the Middle Paleolithic period, the last ice age began and the Neanderthal Mousterian culture was established. Around 35,000 BC, during the Upper Paleolithic, the Neanderthal Châtelperronian cultural period began. Emanating from Southern France this culture extended into the north of the peninsula. It continued to exist until around 28,000 BC when Neanderthal man faced extinction. At about the 40th millennium BC Modern Humans entered the Iberian peninsula, coming from Southern France [ April 2012 ]. Here, this genetically homogeneous population (characterized by the M173 mutation in the Y-chromosome ), developed the M343 mutation, giving rise to the R1b Haplogroup, still the most common in modern Portuguese and Spanish males. On the Iberian peninsula, Modern Humans developed a series of different cultures, such as the Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian culture s, some of them characterized by complex forms of Paleolithic art. [ Neolithic ] During the Neolithic expansion, various megalithic cultures developed in the Iberian Peninsula. An open seas navigation culture from the east Mediterranean, called the Cardium culture, also extended its influence to the eastern coasts of the peninsula, possibly as early as the 5th millennium BC. These people may have had some relation to the subsequent development of the Iberian civilization. [ Chalcolithic ] In the Chalcolithic or Copper Age (c. 3000 BC) a series of complex cultures developed, which would give rise to the peninsula&apos;s first civilizations and to extensive exchange networks reaching to the Baltic, the Middle East and North Africa. At about 2150 BC the Bell Beaker culture intruded into the peninsula, being of Central Europe an origin. [ Bronze Age ] Bronze Age cultures developed beginning c.1800 BC, when the civilization of Los Millares was followed by that of El Argar. From this centre, bronze technology spread to other areas, such as those of the Bronze of Levante, South-Western Iberian Bronze and Cogotas I. In the Late Bronze Age the urban civilisation of Tartessos developed in the area of modern western Andalusia, characterized by Phoenicia n influence and using the Tartessian script for its Tartessian language, a language isolate not related to the Iberian language. Early in the first millennium BC, several waves of Pre-Celts and Celts migrated from Central Europe, thus partially changing the peninsula&apos;s ethnic landscape into Indo-European space in its northern and western regions. In Northwestern Iberia (Northern Portugal and Galicia) a Celtic culture developed, the Castro culture, with a large number of hill forts and some fortified cities. [ Proto-history ] [ Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula ] By the Iron Age, starting in the 7th century BC, the Iberian Peninsula consisted of complex agrarian and urban civilizations, either Pre-Celtic or Celtic (such as the Lusitanians, the Celtiberians, the Gallaeci, the Astur, or the Celtici, amongst others), the cultures of the Iberians in the eastern and southern zones and the cultures of the Aquitanian in the western portion of the Pyrenees. The seafaring Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians successively settled along the Mediterranean coast and founded trading colonies there over a period of several centuries. Around 1100 BC, Phoenician merchants founded the trading colony of Gadir or Gades (modern day Cádiz ) near Tartessos. In the 8th century BC, the first Greek colonies, such as Emporion (modern Empúries ), were founded along the Mediterranean coast on the East, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians. The Greeks coined the name Iberia, after the river Iber ( Ebro ). In the 6th century BC the Carthaginians arrived in the peninsula while struggling with the Greeks for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was Carthago Nova (Latin name of modern day Cartagena ). [ History ] Roman conquest of Hispania Iberian Peninsula in 560 The &apos;&apos;Reconquista&apos;&apos;, 790-1300 Map of Spain and Portugal, &apos;&apos;Atlas historique&apos;&apos;, dated approximately 1705-1739, of H.A. Chatelain. [ Roman rule ] [ Hispania ] In 219 BC the first Roman troops invaded the Iberian Peninsula, during the Second Punic war against the Carthaginians, and annexed it under Augustus after two centuries of war with the Celtic and Iberian tribes and the Phoenician, Greek and Carthaginian colonies, resulting in the creation of the province of Hispania. It was divided into Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior during the late Roman Republic, and during the Roman Empire, it was divided into Hispania Taraconensis in the northeast, Hispania Baetica in the south and Lusitania in the southwest. Hispania supplied the Roman Empire with food, olive oil, wine, and metal. The emperors Trajan, Hadrian, and Theodosius I, the philosopher Seneca, and the poets Martial and Lucan were born from families living on the peninsula. [ Germanic kingdoms ] [ Visigothic Kingdom Spania ] In the early 5th century, Germanic tribes invaded the peninsula, namely the Suevi, the Vandals ( Silingi and Hasdingi ) and their allies, the Sarmatian Alans. Only the kingdom of the Suevi ( Quadi and Marcomanni ) would endure after the arrival of another wave of Germanic invaders, the Visigoths, who conquered all of the Iberian peninsula and expelled or partially integrated the Vandals and the Alans. The Visigoths eventually conquered the Suevi kingdom and its capital city Bracara (modern day Braga ) in 584-585. They would also conquer the province of the Byzantine Empire (552-624) of Spania in the south of the peninsula and the Balearic Islands. [ Islamic rule ] [ Al-Andalus Islam in Spain ] In AD 711, a North Africa n Moorish Umayyad army invaded Visigothic Christian Hispania. Under their leader Tariq ibn-Ziyad, they landed at Gibraltar and brought most of the Iberian Peninsula under Islamic rule in an eight-year campaign. Al-ʾAndalūs ( Arabic الإندلس : Land of the Vandals) is the Arabic name given the Iberian Peninsula by its Muslim conquerors and its subsesquent inhabitants. From the 8th-15th centuries, parts of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by the Moors (mainly Berber and Arab ) who had crossed over from North Africa. [ Reconquest ] [ Reconquista ] Many of the ousted Gothic nobles took refuge in the unconquered north Asturian highlands. From there, they aimed to reconquer their lands from the Moors; this war of reconquest is known as the Reconquista. Christian and Muslim kingdoms fought and allied among themselves. The Muslim taifa kings competed in patronage of the arts, the Way of Saint James attracted pilgrims from all Western Europe, and the Jewish population set the basis of Sephardic culture. [ March 2009 ] During the middle ages the peninsula housed many small states including Castile, Aragon, Navarre, León and Portugal. The peninsula was part of the Islamic Almohad empire until they were finally uprooted. The last major Muslim stronghold was Granada which was eliminated by a combined Castilian and Aragonese force in 1492. [ Post reconquest ] [ History of Andorra History of Gibraltar History of Portugal History of Spain ] The small states gradually amalgamated over time, with the exception of Portugal, even if for a brief period (1580–1640) the whole peninsula was united politically under the Iberian Union. After that point the modern position was reached and the peninsula now consists of the countries of Spain and Portugal (excluding their islands—the Portuguese Azores and Madeira Islands and the Spanish Canary Islands and Balearic Islands; and the Spanish exclave s of Ceuta and Melilla ), Andorra, French Cerdagne and Gibraltar. [ Geography ] [ Geography of Portugal Geography of Spain ] [ Overall characteristics ] An 18th century map of the peninsula depicting various topographical features of the land, as published in Robert Wilkinson&apos;s &apos;&apos;General Atlas&apos;&apos;, circa 1794. { Miño/Minho, } { Duero/Douro, } { Tajo/Tejo, } { Guadiana, } { Guadalquivir, } { Segura, } { Júcar/Xúquer, } { Ebro/Ebre. } The Iberian Peninsula extends from the southernmost extremity at Punta de Tarifa ( [ 36 00 15 N 5 36 37 W inline ] ) to the northernmost extremity at Estaca de Bares Point ( [ 43 47 38 N 7 41 17 W inline ] ) over a distance between lines of latitude of about [ 865 km mi on ] based on a degree length of [ 111 km mi on ] per degree, and from the westernmost extremity at Cabo da Roca ( [ 38 46 51 N 9 29 54 W inline ] ) to the easternmost extremity at Cap de Creus ( [ 42 19 09 N 3 19 19 E inline ] ) over a distance between lines of longitude at 40° N latitude of about [ 1155 km mi on ] based on an estimated degree length of about [ 90 km mi on ] for that latitude. The irregular, roughly octagonal shape of the peninsula contained within this spherical quadrangle was compared to an ox-hide by the geographer Strabo. { III.1.3. } About three quarters of that rough octagon is the Meseta Central, a low and rolling plateau of up to several hundred metres in altitude. [ Fischer T 1920 The Iberian Peninsula: Spain Mill Hugh Robert The International Geography New York and London D. Appleton and Company 368–377 ] { Downloadable Google Books } It is located approximately in the centre, staggered slightly to the east and tilted slightly toward the west (the conventional centre of the Iberian Peninsula has long been considered to be Getafe just south of Madrid ). It is ringed by mountains and contains the sources of most of the rivers, which find their way through gaps in the mountain barriers on all sides. [ Coastline ] The coastline of the Iberian Peninsula is [ 3313 km mi on ], [ 1660 km mi on ] on the Mediterranean side and [ 1653 km mi on ] on the Atlantic side. { These figures sum the figures given in the Wikipedia articles on the geography of Spain and Portugal. Most figures from Internet sources on Spain and Portugal include the coastlines of the islands owned by each country and thus are not a reliable guide to the coastline of the peninsula. Moreover, the length of a coastline may vary significantly depending on where and how it is measured. } The coast has been inundated over time, with sea levels having risen from a minimum of [ 115 - 120 m ft on ] lower than today at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to its current level at 4000 years BP.

An estimated [ 700 km mi on ] length of Atlantic shelf is only [ 10 - 65 km mi on ] wide. At the [ 500 m ft on ] isobath, on the edge, the shelf drops off to [ 1000 m ft on ].

Ultimately the shelf drops into the Bay of Biscay on the north (an abyss), the Iberian abyssal plain at [ 4800 m ft on ] on the west and Tagus abyssal plain to the south. In the north between the continental shelf and the abyss is an extension, the Galicia Bank, a plateau containing also the Porto, Vigo and Vasco da Gama seamount s, creating the Galicia interior basin. The southern border of these features is marked by Nazare Canyon, splitting the continental shelf and leading directly into the abyss. [ Mountains ] Mountains consist mainly of serrated ridges aligned in an east-west direction, due to the orogenic factors of the region&apos;s geologic history. Rivers generally flow through the valleys between the ridges. In a counterclockwise direction, the major mountain ranges are: the Pyrenees crossing the isthmus of the peninsula so completely as to allow no passage except by mountain road or trail or coastal road, the Cantabrian Mountains perched on the northern coastline, the Sistema Ibérico, the Sistema Central, the Montes de Toledo, the Sierra Morena and the Sierra Nevada.

[ Major metropolitan areas ] The main metropolitan areas and conurbations over a million are: Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, Valencia, Porto, Seville, Bilbao and Málaga. [ Ecology ] [ Forests ] [ Forests of the Iberian Peninsula ] The woodlands of the Iberian Peninsula are distinct ecosystem s. Although the various regions are each characterized by distinct vegetation, there are some similarities across the peninsula. While the borders between these regions are not clearly defined, there is a mutual influence which makes it very hard to establish boundaries and some species find their optimal habitat in the intermediate areas. [ East Atlantic flyway ] The Iberian Peninsula in an important stopover on the East Atlantic flyway for birds migrating from northern Europe to Africa. For example, Calidis ferruginea rests in the region of Cadiz Bay.

In Galicia are the Ria de Arousa (a home of Pluvialis squatarola ), Ria de Ortigueira, Ria de Corme and Ria de Laxe. In Portugal the Aveiro Lagoon hosts Recurvirostra avosetta, Charadrius hiaticula, Pluvialis squatarola and Calidris minuta. Ribatejo Province on the Tagus River supports Recurvirostra arosetta, Pluvialis squatarola, Culidris alpina, Limosa lapponica and Tringa totanus. In the Estuário do Sado are Calidris alpina, Numenius arquata, Pluvialis squatarola and Tringa totanus. The Algarve hosts Calidris canutus, Tringa nebularia and Arenaria interpres. The Marismas de Guadalquivir region of Andalusia and the Salinas de Cádiz are especially rich in wintering wading birds: Charadrius alexandrinus, Charadrius hiaticula, Calidris alba, and Limosa limosa in addition to the others. And finally, the Ebro delta is home to all the species mentioned above.

World class mineral deposit s can also be found there. The core of the Iberian Peninsula consists of a Hercynian craton ic block known as the Iberian Massif. On the northeast this is bounded by The Pyrenean fold belt, and on the southeast it is bounded by the Betic Foldchain. These twofold chains are part of the Alpine belt. To the west, the peninsula is delimited by the continental boundary formed by the magma poor opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Hercynian Foldbelt is mostly buried by Mesozoic and Tertiary cover rocks to the east, but nevertheless outcrops through the Iberian Chain and the Catalonia n Coastal Ranges. [ Languages ] [ Languages of Iberia ] [ Languages of Andorra Languages of Gibraltar Languages of Spain Languages of Portugal ] Most modern languages of Iberia descend from Vulgar Latin, except for Basque which is of unknown origin. Throughout history (and pre-history), many different languages have been spoken in the Iberian Peninsula contributing to the formation and differentiation of the contemporanean languages of Iberia, however most of them have become extinct or fallen into disuse. Basque is the only non-Indo-European surviving language in Iberia and Western Europe. In modern times, Spanish (cf. 30 to 40 million speakers), Portuguese (cf. around 10 million speakers), Catalan (cf. around 9 million speakers), Galician (cf. around 3 million speakers) and Basque (cf. around half a million speakers) are the most widely spoken languages in the Iberian Peninsula. Out of these languages; only two, Spanish and Portuguese, have expanded beyond Iberia to the rest of world, thus becoming global language s.
