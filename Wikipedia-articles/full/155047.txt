[ the town in Cheshire people called Frodsham Frodsham (surname) ] [ England Frodsham 240px Frodsham from Overton/Frodsham Hill 53.295 -2.725 8,982 (2001) Frodsham Cheshire West and Chester Cheshire North West England Weaver Vale FRODSHAM WA6 WA 01928 SJ520775 ] Frodsham is a market town and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. Its population is 8,982. { Office for National Statistics : &apos;&apos;Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Vale Royal&apos;&apos;. Retrieved 2009-12-15. } It is approximately [ 3 mi km 0 ] south of Runcorn, 16  miles (26  km) south of Liverpool, and approximately [ 28 mi km 0 ] south-west of Manchester. The River Weaver runs to its north east and on the west it overlooks the estuary of the River Mersey. The A56 road and the Chester-Manchester railway line pass through the town, and the M56 motorway passes to the north west. In medieval times Frodsham was an important borough and port belonging to the Earls of Chester [ August 2009 ] Its parish church, St. Laurence&apos;s, still exhibits evidence of a building present in the 12th century in its nave [ August 2009 ] and is referenced in the Domesday Book. A market is held each Thursday, and Frodsham&apos;s viability as a trading centre is emphasised by the presence of the &quot; big four &quot; clearing banks and several building societies. Development in the town&apos;s shops and premises with alcohol licences is evident through the recent (post-2002) opening or modernisation of contemporary-style bar/restaurants, take-away food shops and public houses, and in the continued presence of small, specialised, businesses operating from town centre shops. [ History ] [ Etymology ] The etymology of Frodsham&apos;s name is not entirely clear. A literal translation of the Old English would give personal name of Frod or an old spelling of Ford, and ham which means a village or homestead; hence Frod&apos;s village or the Village on the Ford (Ford-ham). However, an alternative, more obscure etymology exists which suggests the name means &quot; promontory into marsh &quot;, which would make sense considering that Frodsham had a promontory castle very close to marshland. Frodsham is unique as the name of a settlement in the British Isles. { The exact quote in Latham page 14 reads: &quot; Frodsham is unique in the British Isles in that the name does not occur anywhere else. &quot; } { Though a nearby township was referred to during the period of the } { ancient parishes of Cheshire as &quot; Newton by Frodsham &quot;, its current name is now just &quot; Newton &quot;. See Dunn, F. I. (1987). page 27. which states that, at the time. the Newton township near to Frodsham was referred to as &quot; Newton by Frodsham &quot;. Furthermore, see } { Ordnance Survey (2004), which refers to the modern settlement which was Newton by Frodsham township just as &quot; Newton &quot; without any Frodsham component: } [ SJ531751 ] Earlier spellings of the name have included Fradsham, Frandsham, Frodisham, Ffradsam and Ffradsham. [ Latham 1987 14. ] [ Early history ] Frodsham Hill is the location of an Iron Age promontory fort, the outline of which can still be seen. [ http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id%3D71527 Monument no. 71527 Pastscape 6 May 2009 ] The town is of Saxon origin; its 11th-century church is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Frodsham was an important manor of the medieval Earls of Chester and was created a borough in the early 13th century, probably by Earl Ranulf III. The mouth of the River Weaver, where it joins the Mersey, made Frodsham into a significant port for the coasting trade, particularly for the export of Cheshire salt, brought down the river from Northwich and Nantwich. The site of the manor house was in Castle Park; the building was of stone and was fortified. In an account of 1315 it is called &apos;castellum&apos; (little castle), although &apos;manerium&apos; (manor house) was the usual designation. [ Recent history ] Frodsham was the headquarters of Runcorn Rural District Council. In 1974 the district was split between Halton Borough Council, Warrington Borough Council and Vale Royal District Council (latterly Vale Royal Borough Council). In the early 1990s Vale Royal Borough Council opened a new purpose-built headquarters in Winsford. At the same time, its offices in Hartford near Northwich (the former headquarters of Northwich Rural District Council) and at Castle Park in Frodsham (the former headquarters of Runcorn Rural District Council) became downgraded. Castle Park House had a major refurbishment in 2005–06 and now operates as a &quot; one-stop shop &quot; for Cheshire West and Chester Council providing a number of services for the community and for businesses. Frodsham Castle Park Arts Centre (photo: Neil Kennedy) In 1992 the parish council became Frodsham Town Council and Frodsham was no longer a village. The chair of the parish council became the mayor of Frodsham. The majority of powers were held by Cheshire County Council and Vale Royal Borough Council who were replaced by Cheshire West and Chester Council on 1 April 2009. Frodsham was home to Frodsham School, a science and technology college, which closed in July 2009 due to the falling birth rate and amalgamated with Helsby High School. The site is to be redeveloped and will provide a new health centre for the town. Frodsham, like the neighbouring village Helsby, has a hill overlooking the Mersey Estuary which is popular with dog walkers and naturalists. Frodsham Hill, overlooking Frodsham and the Liverpool skyline, is a large sandstone hill, home to many farms, prestige homes and the Mersey View nightclub (commonly known as &apos;the View&apos;) and Forest Hills Hotel. Before the construction of the hotel and nightclub, famously hosting one of the Beatles first appearances, the site was home to a very large helter skelter. The Frodsham Caves are found in the sandstone foundations of Frodsham Hill. [ Geography ] Map of civil parish of Frodsham within the former borough of Vale Royal Frodsham sits beneath the imposing wooded escarpment of Beacon Hill, which is also known locally as Frodsham Hill or Overton Hill and whose top attains a height of just over [ 500 ft m 0 ]. The hill forms the northern end of the Mid-Cheshire Ridge, a range of sandstone hills that extends southwards to Delamere Forest and Tarporley. The northern boundaries of the modern parish are defined by the River Weaver (canalised in part as the Weaver Navigation ) and the inner Mersey Estuary into which it flows. The Manchester Ship Canal runs parallel to the Mersey along the northern edge of the low-lying ground of Frodsham Marsh and Lordship Marsh, which themselves extend south and east to the built-up area of Frodsham. The town is centred on the junction of the A56, the main thoroughfare between Chester and Warrington, with the B5152 road, which runs southeast to connect with Kingsley, Northwich and Tarporley in the centre of the county. The Chester–Manchester railway line passes through the town whilst the M56 motorway runs parallel to the road and railway along the southeastern edge of the marsh. The formerly separate settlements of Netherton and Overton form the southern districts of the town whilst the easternmost section towards Frodsham Bridge is known as Newtown. { Ordnance Survey, Explorer map sheet 267 } [ Geology ] The parish, like most in Cheshire, is underlain by a suite of sedimentary rock s, which date from the Triassic Period. They comprise (in ascending order) the Lower Triassic age Kinnerton Sandstone, Chester Pebble Beds and Wilmslow Sandstone Formations together with the upper Triassic age Helsby Sandstone, Tarporley Siltstone and Sidmouth Mudstone Formations. Those formations up to and including the Helsby Sandstone Formation are assigned to the Sherwood Sandstone Group. It is this formation whose relatively hard-wearing sandstone s form the higher ground of Beacon Hill, Woodhouse Hill and Harrol Edge. The younger siltstone s and mudstone s are assigned to the Mercia Mudstone Group. [ Phillips and Phillips 2002 4–5. ] The sequence of sandstones is exposed in a railway cutting and two road cuttings, which are designated as an earth sciences Site of Special Scientific Interest. { Natural England: Frodsham Railway And Road Cuttings. Retrieved 16 April 2010. } { Natural England: Nature on the Map: Frodsham Railway &amp; Road Cuttings SSSI. Retrieved 16 April 2010. } Several faults run roughly northwest–southeast through the area, notably the Overton Fault, which roughly parallels the B5439 and B5152 roads, and the Frodsham Fault, which runs north from the vicinity of Crowmere to the mouth of the River Weaver. Both of these faults and others in the area downthrow to the east. Movement on them is thought to have taken place in the Tertiary period. The uplift resulted in trapping the water table at an elevation of around [ 200 ft m 0 ] at which level springs developed. [ Dodd 1987 4. ] Overlying the bedrock are a variety of superficial deposits (otherwise known as drift ). These comprise a thin and patchy cover of glacial till (or &apos;boulder clay&apos;), largely a legacy of the last ice age, together with spreads of glacio-fluvial sand and gravel, a product of the eventual deglaciation of the area. Recent alluvium fills the deeply incised valley of the Weaver and also extends across the Marsh to the Mersey Estuary. { British Geological Survey 1:50K map sheet 97, &apos;Runcorn&apos; } [ Climate ] Being close to the west coast and the Irish Sea, the climate is generally temperate with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean average temperature in the years 1971 to 2000 was 9.4 to 9.7°C, slightly above the average for the United Kingdom [ http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif Mean Temperature: Annual Average 1971–2000 2007-05-22 Met Office ] as was the average amount of annual sunshine at 1391 to 1470  hours.

Two councillors are elected from the Frodsham ward to serve on that Council. The Frodsham ward has the same boundaries as the Town&apos;s own parish boundaries. The current Councillors are Cllr Andrew Dawson and Cllr Lynn Riley, both Conservatives, who were both elected to serve a four-year term of office in May 2011. Frodsham Town Council is the local council or parish council for Frodsham. This council is made up of sixteen councillors. The town councillors are elected from one of four parish wards conveniently called Frodsham North, Frodsham South, Frodsham East and Frodsham West. Four Councillors are elected from both the North and South wards, five from East and three from the West ward. These Town Councillors are elected to serve four year terms of office, the most recent elections being in May 2011. If any vacancy occurs during the four-year term 10 local parishioners from the relevant ward can require a by-election to be held, otherwise the other Town Councillors can co-opt an eligible person to be a Councillor. The last by-election occurred in August 2011 in South ward. The last co-option occurred in September 2011 in North ward. All sixteen places are currently filled, primarily by councillors who are not members of any political party but who campaigned together with the common manifesto of putting &apos;Frodsham First&apos;. The Councillors are: { www.frodsham.gov.uk } for Frodsham North; Cllr Rita Shearn (Frod First), Cllr Frank Pennington (Frod First), Cllr Pammi Taylor (Ind), Cllr Allen Wales (Ind); for Frodsham South; Cllr Lynn Riley (Con), Cllr Sara Wakefield (Con), Cllr Fran Sutton (Frod First), Cllr Carol Davis (Con); for Frodsham East; Cllr Andrew Dawson (Con), Cllr Linda Brown (Frod First, Cllr Mark Warren (Frod First), Cllr Ruth Redhead (Frod First), Cllr Graham Bondi (Ind); for Frodsham West; Cllr Darren Kelly (Frod First), Cllr Kyle McGregor ( Lab ), Cllr John Nield (Frod First). The then Frodsham parish council resolved to style itself a town in 1992. From 1992 to May 2012 the chairman of the council has served as the Town Mayor but using the courtesy title of &apos;Mayor of Frodsham.&apos; However strictly the chairman is only entitled to call him or herself &apos;town mayor.&apos; In April 2012 the council resolved to split the roles of Chairman and Mayor of Frodsham and separate votes are now held for each position - although the council also resolved to offer the Mayorship to the councillor who had served the longest since last being Mayor, or having been first elected. In order to comply with the restrictive provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 the Chairman declares when accepting the office of Chairman of the Council that he wishes to be addressed as &apos;Chairman&apos;, and that he does not wish to use the style &apos;town mayor.&apos; The Councillor who is elected to the position of &apos;Mayor of Frodsham&apos; is in fact elected to serve as the council&apos;s principal civic representative and as the deputy chairman. Under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972 the deputy chairman can fulfil any of the roles of the Chairman. In essence the Chairman delegates the performance of the civic representative role to his deputy and consents to him or her being known under the courtesy title of &apos;Mayor of Frodsham.&apos; The importance of this split is that it allows the Mayor to concentrate on promoting Frodsham to the wider world and civic and democratic society within Frodsham. It also allows the tradition to continue where the Mayorship changes each year. The Chairman leads the council. He can, if the councillors choose, continue to serve as Chairman from year to year - enabling consistent leadership. The following councillors have served as the Mayor of FrodshamFrank Pennington 1992–3;Brian Lloyd 1993–4; 2010–11;Margaret Blythe 1994–5;Christine Lloyd 1995–6;Mike Pusey 1996–7;Graham Bondi 1997–8; 2003–4;Barry Honeyford 1998–9;Dave Thompson 1999–2000;Nigel Griffiths 2000–1; 2005–6;Maureen Turner 2001–2; 2004–5;Dennis Taylor 2002–3: 2006–7;John Maddock 2007–8;Pammi Taylor 2008–9;Geoff Bath 2009–10;Andrew Dawson 2011–2012;Lynn Riley 2012 - date. The present Chairman of the Council is Cllr Mark Warren. He was elected to this role in May 2012. { www.frodsham.gov.uk } [ Notable people ] [ Check digit (X) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] [ http://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/main-menu-cheshire-property%2C-places-and-interiors-why-you-should-move-to-frodsham--1699 Why you should move to Frodsham Archant Life Limited 2008-10-07 ] [ http://www.patricklarley.com/biography/biography.html Patrick Larley: Biography Patrick Larley www.patricklarley.com 2008-06-11 ] [ http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0%2C%2C925452%2C00.html High society Guardian News and Media Limited 2008-10-07 The Observer London Simon Garfield 2003-03-30 ] [ January 2010 ] [ http://www.garybarlow.com Gary Barlow: Official website www.garybarlow.com 2008-10-02 ] [ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/footballs-lord-of-the-manor-bans-hunting-on-his-nine-acres-491233.html The Independent: Football&apos;s lord of the manor bans hunting on his nine acres Independent News and Media Limited 2008-10-06 London Ian Herbert 2005-05-19 ] William Charles Cotton (1813–79), who introduced beekeeping to New Zealand, was vicar of Frodsham from 1859 until his death.
