[ April 2010 ] [ August 2010 ] [ Socialist Alliance File:Socialist Alliance logo.jpg Socialist Alliance Collective Leadership with National Co-convenors (Susan Price and Peter Boyle) 2001 Socialism, Anti-capitalism, Far-left Ecosocialism, Environmentalism 22-36 Mountain St, Ultimo, NSW 2007 http://www.socialist-alliance.org/ ] The Socialist Alliance was founded in 2001 as an alliance of socialist organisations and individuals in Australia, initiated by the Democratic Socialist Perspective and the International Socialist Organisation along with 6 other founding socialist organisations, to create greater left unity in the aftermath of the protest of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne on 11–13 September 2000. With branches in all states and territories, [ http://www.socialist-alliance.org/page.php?page%3D253 Socialist Alliance branches contact details Socialist Alliance 28 September 2011 ] and electoral registration federally and in a number of states, it is the largest group on the Australian far Left. [ History ] Soon after its formation, the Socialist Alliance grew to a point where most of its members were not members of any of the affiliate organisations. [ http://www.greenleft.org.au/2005/620/35070 Socialist Alliance - what&apos;s worth defending Green Left Weekly 23 March 2005 11 November 2009 ] In response to this, the Democratic Socialist Perspective and many non-aligned members argued successfully at successive national conferences for measures to take the Socialist Alliance in the direction of becoming a united socialist party. Other affiliates, particularly the International Socialist Organisation, preferred to adhere to the alliance&apos;s original direction: a broad left-wing electoral front. In late 2003, the Democratic Socialist Party resolved to become a &quot; a Marxist tendency in the Socialist Alliance &quot;, renaming itself the &quot; Democratic Socialist Perspective &quot; as a step towards turning the Socialist Alliance into a &quot; Multi-Tendency Socialist Party &quot;. This move was supported by some 75% of conference delegates at the SA&apos;s national conference that year, { &quot; Socialist Alliance 2003 Conference Minutes } &quot; although other affiliates remained opposed. At the 2005 National Conference particularly sharp political differences were expressed. These centred on: the extent to which the Socialist Alliance should criticise the Australian Labor Party; whether the organisation should have a formal relationship with the newspaper associated with the Democratic Socialist Perspective, Green Left Weekly, as a step towards Socialist Alliance itself having its own newspaper; and whether non-aligned members should have an automatic majority on the organisation&apos;s national executive. Following this conference three of the leading members of a &quot; Non-Aligned Caucus &quot; and most of the active affiliate organisations gradually withdrew. The &quot; Non Aligned Caucus &quot; was an ad hoc grouping of SA members who weren&apos;t aligned to any affiliated organisation which formed { Socialist Alliance May 2003 national conference } in the lead up to the 2003 conference of the Alliance. In January 2010, the Democratic Socialist Perspective voted to merge into the Socialist Alliance, in effect ceasing to exist as an affiliate organisation. [ Branches and Members ] In addition to its branches in the major capital cities Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Hobart and Adelaide, the Socialist Alliance also maintains branches in and around a number of regional centres, including in Wollongong, Newcastle, Armidale, Geelong, Ballarat, Lismore, Cairns, Townsville and on the Gold Coast.
