She was the second &apos;&apos;Kiev&apos;&apos; -class vessel to be built. [ History ] Named after the capital city of Belarus, the Minsk was laid down in 1972, launched on 30 September 1975, completed on 27 September 1978, and decommissioned on 30 June 1993. The Minsk operated with the Pacific Fleet. She was retired as a result of a major accident (details not known) which required the facilities at the Chernomorskiy yard, in Mykolayiv, located in the newly-independent Ukraine (the reasons for not attempting a repair are not known). In 1995 she was sold to a South Korean businessman, and later resold to Shenzhen Minsk Aircraft Carrier Industry Company Limited, a Chinese company. Until 2006, when the company went bankrupt, Minsk was part of a military theme park in Yantian district, Shatoujiao (沙头角) sub-district, Shenzhen called Minsk World. The aircraft carrier was put up for auction on 22 March 2006. No bids at the starting price of 128 million RMB were received, so the carrier was withdrawn from sale. On 31 May 2006, the Soviet aircraft carrier was finally auctioned off in Shenzhen for 128 million RMB to CITIC Shenzhen, { Former Soviet aircraft carrier sold in China for $16mln } the current operator. The panorama below shows the Aircraft Carrier at the CITIC Minsk World in Shenzhen, its current location. The park is open to public. 800px [ See also ] List of aircraft carriers of Russia and the Soviet Union [ References ] [ External links ] Official website &quot; Bids fall short for ex-Soviet aircraft carrier &quot; MaritimeQuest Minsk pages Satellite Photo of Minsk in the military theme park in Shenzhen from Google Maps [ 22 33 13 N 114 14 12 E region:CN-44_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki title ] Category:Kiev class aircraft carriers Category:Ships built in the Soviet Union Category:1975 ships Category:Cold War aircraft carriers of the Soviet Union Category:Shenzhen Category:Museum ships in China cs:Minsk (letadlová loď) de:Minsk (Flugdeckkreuzer) fr:Minsk (porte-avions) ja:ミンスク (空母) no:«Minsk» (1978) pt:Porta-aviões soviético Minsk ru:Минск (авианесущий крейсер) uk:Мінськ (авіаносець) zh-yue:明思克號航空母艦 zh:明斯克號航空母艦
