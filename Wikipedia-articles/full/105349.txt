[ January 2010 ] An airline alliance is an agreement between two or more airline s to cooperate on a substantial level. The three largest passenger alliances are the Star Alliance, SkyTeam and Oneworld. Alliances also form between cargo airline s, such as that of WOW Alliance, SkyTeam Cargo and ANA/UPS Alliance. Alliances provide a network of connectivity and convenience for international passengers and international packages. Alliances also provide convenient marketing branding to facilitate travelers making inter-airline codeshare connections within countries. This branding goes as far as to even include unified aircraft liveries among member airlines. [ Rationale ] Benefits can consist of: Sales offices Maintenance facilities Operational facilities, e.g. catering or computer systems. Operational staff, e.g. ground handling personnel, at check-in and boarding desks. Investments and purchases, e.g. in order to negotiate extra volume discounts. { Traveler benefits can include: } Lower prices due to lowered operational costs for a given route. More departure times to choose from on a given route. More destinations within easy reach. Shorter travel times as a result of optimised transfers. A wider range of airport lounge s shared with alliance members Faster mileage rewards by earning miles for a single account on several different carriers. Round-the-world ticket s, enabling travelers to fly over the world for a relatively low price. Airline alliances may also create disadvantages for the traveler, such as: Higher prices when all competition is erased on a certain route. Less frequent flights: for instance, if two airlines separately fly three and two times a day respectively on a shared route, their alliance might fly less than 5(3+2) times a day on the same route. This might be especially true between hub cities for each airline. e.g., flights between Detroit (a Delta Air Lines fortress hub ) and Amsterdam (a KLM fortress hub). [ Issues ] The ability of an airline to join an alliance is often restricted by laws and regulations or subject to approval by authorities. Antitrust laws play a large role. Landing rights may not be owned by the airlines themselves but by the nation in which their head office resides. If an airline loses its national identity by merging to a large extent with a foreign company, existing agreements may be declared void by a country which objects to the merger. In 2010 Swiss lost overflight rights after being bought by Lufthansa. { Moscow&apos;s muscle flexing about overflight rights aims beyond Switzerland | World | Deutsche Welle | 12.06.2010.

The first large alliance started in 1989, when Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines agreed to code sharing on a large scale. A huge step was taken in 1992 when The Netherlands signed the first open skies agreement with the United States, in spite of objections from the European Union authorities. This gave both countries unrestricted landing rights on each others&apos; soil. Normally landing rights are granted for a fixed number of flights per week to a fixed destination. Each adjustment takes negotiating, often between governments rather than between the companies involved. The United States was so pleased with the independent position that the Dutch took versus the E.U. that it granted antitrust immunity to the alliance between Northwest and KLM. Other alliances would struggle for years to overcome transnational barriers or still do so. The Star Alliance was founded in 1997 which forced competing airlines to form Oneworld in 1999 and SkyTeam in 2000. In 2010 Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group, announced his intention to form a fourth alliance among Virgin branded airlines ( Virgin Atlantic; Virgin America; and the Virgin Australia Holdings group of airlines). { Perman, Stacy.

Network strengths are continents or regions where listed airlines have one or more hubs or a major presence in several destinations. Network weaknesses are continents or regions with no hubs and few (if any) flights for any airline in the alliance. On June 19, 2008, Continental announced that it would be leaving SkyTeam on October 24, 2009 and began participating in Star Alliance on October 27, 2009 as part of a codesharing agreement with Star Alliance charter member United Airlines (Continental cut its codeshare ties to Delta and Northwest). Continental Airlines – Proud member of Star Alliance. Continental.com (2009-10-27). Retrieved on 2011-03-04. United and Continental merged in 2010. As the table shows, the three alliances combined fly 60.8% of all passengers.
