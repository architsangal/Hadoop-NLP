Trigonocephaly.png Fused suture in trigonocephaly ] Trigonocephaly (Greek: &apos;trigonon&apos; = triangle, &apos;kephale&apos; = head) is a congenital condition of premature fusion of the metopic suture (Greek: &apos;metopon&apos; = forehead) leading to a triangular shaped forehead. The merging of the two frontal bones leads to transverse growth restriction and parallel growth expansion. It may occur syndromic involving other abnormalities or isolated. [ History ] In former times people born with malformed skulls were rejected based upon their appearance. { Strickler M, van der Meulen J, Rahael B, Mazolla R. Craniofacial malformations.

Thus, whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head (by prominence is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which projects beyond the rest of it), in him the sutures of the head take the form of the Greek letter &apos;tau&apos;, τ. { Hippocrates.

He described a child with a V-shaped skull and a cleft lip. { Welcker H. Untersugungen uber wachtsum und bau des menschlischen Schädels. Leipzig: Engelmann, 1862. } [ Etiology ] Trigonocephaly can either occur syndromatic or isolated. Trigonocephaly is associated with the following syndromes: Opitz syndrome, Muenke syndrome, Jacobsen syndrome, Baller-Gerold syndrome and Say-Meyer syndrome. The etiology of trigonocephaly is mostly unknown although there are three main theories. Trigonocephaly is probably a multifactorial congenital condition, but due to limited proof of these theories this cannot safely be concluded. [ Intrinsic bone malformation ] The first theory assumes that the origin of pathological synostosis lies within disturbed bone formation early on in the pregnancy.

Firstly, the supraorbital bar is remodelled by a wired greenstick fracture to straighten it. Secondly, the supraorbital bar is moved 2  cm. forward and fixed only to the frontal process of the zygoma without fixation to the cranium. Lastly, the frontal bone is divided into two, rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar causing a nude area ( craniectomy ) between the parietal bone and frontal bone. Bone will eventually regenerate since the dura mater lies underneath (the dura mater has osteogenic capabilities). This results in an advancement and straightening of the forehead. [ ‘Floating forehead technique’ ] The so-called ‘floating forehead technique’ combined with the remodelling of the supraorbital bar is derived from the fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. The supraorbital bar is remodelled as described above. { Marchac D. Radical forehead remodelling for craniostenosis.

Instead of using both pieces as in fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling, only one piece is rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar. This technique also leaves a craniectomy behind. { Marchac D, Renier D, Jones BM. Experience with the &quot; floating forehead &quot;.

[ Treatment results ] [ Surgical ] Trigonocephaly seems to be the most compliant form of craniosynostosis for surgery.

Marchac procedure in the early treatment of metopic and coronal synostoses. Presented at the Consensus Conference on Craniosynostoses, Rome 1995. } The simple suturectomy is presently insufficient to adjust the complicated growth restrictions caused by metopic synostosis. On the other hand the fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling and the ‘floating forehead technique’ create sufficient space for brain growth and result in a normal horizontal axis of the orbits and supraorbital bar. The fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling is the most used method nowadays. Over the past few years distraction osteogenesis has been gradually acknowledged since it has a positive effect on hypotelorism. Expanding the distance between the orbits using springs seems to be successful. { Lauritzen CG, Davis C, Ivarsson A, Sanger C, Hewitt TD.

Surgery does not provide a 100% natural outcome, mostly there will be minor irregularities. Reoperations are usually performed on more severe cases (including syndromic metopic synostosis). The hypotelorism and temporal hollowing are the most difficult to correct: the hypotelorism usually remains under corrected and a second operation is often needed for correction of temporal hollowing. { Posnick JC, Lin KY, Chen P, Armstrong D.

Surgery is performed generally before the age of one because of claims of better intellectual outcome. Seemingly surgery does not influence the high incidence of neurodevelopment problems in patients with metopic synostosis. Neurological disorders such as ADHD, ASD, ODD and CD are seen in patients with trigonocephaly. These disorders are usually also associated with decreased IQ. The presence of ADHD, ASD and ODD is higher in cases with an IQ below 85. This is not the case with CD which showed an insignificant increase at an IQ below 85. [ In popular culture ] Via a photo shown on a Facebook page, the mother of a child previously diagnosed with this affliction recognised the symptoms and reported them to the family involved, resulting in an immediate diagnosis that medical professionals had overlooked in all earlier consultations.
