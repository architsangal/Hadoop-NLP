[ April 2012 ] Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and infrastructure but weakened after the collapse of the Florida land boom of the 1920s, the 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression in the 1930s. When World War II began, Miami, well-situated due to its location on the southern coast of Florida, played an important role in the battle against German submarines. The war helped to expand Miami&apos;s population; by 1940, 172,172 people lived in the city. After Fidel Castro rose to power in 1959, many Cuba ns sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the population. In the 1980s and 1990s, various crises struck South Florida, among them the Arthur McDuffie beating and the subsequent riot, drug wars, Hurricane Andrew, and the Elián González uproar. Nevertheless, in the latter half of the 20th century, Miami became a major international, financial, and cultural center. Miami and its metropolitan area grew from just over one thousand residents to nearly five and a half million residents in just 110 years (1896–2006). The city&apos;s nickname, The Magic City, comes from this rapid growth. Winter visitors remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic.

Additionally, 52% of Miami-Dade County&apos;s population doesn&apos;t live in any incorporated city. Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the Florida Everglades to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east that also extends from Florida Bay north to Lake Okeechobee.

The highest undulations are found along the coastal Miami Rock Ridge, whose substrate underlies most of the eastern Miami metropolitan region. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created barrier island s, the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach. The Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, runs northward just [ 15 mi km ] off the coast, allowing the city&apos;s climate to stay warm and mild all year. [ Geology ] { Coconut Grove, near the bay, along the } { Miami Rock Ridge at } [ 24 ft m ] { above sea level. } [ http://www2.fiu.edu/~whitmand/Courses/Fl_geo_notes.html Notes on the geology and Water Resources of South Florida Dean Whitman September 1997 Notes on Florida Geology Florida International University January 11, 2011 ] The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called Miami oolite or Miami limestone. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than [ 50 ft m ] thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciation s or ice age s. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels to approximately [ 25 ft m ] above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida plateau, stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas. The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans. Starting about 100,000 years ago the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to 300 to [ 350 ft m ] below the contemporary level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the mainland of South Florida just above sea level. Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, [ http://capp.water.usgs.gov/gwa/ch_g/G-text4.html USGS Ground Water Atlas of the United States United States Geological Survey February 19, 2006 ] a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay, with its highest point peaking around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah. Most of the South Florida metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than [ 15 to 20 ft m on ] beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction. For this reason, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade. Most of the western fringes of the city extend into the Everglades, a subtropical marshland located in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida. This causes occasional problems with local wildlife such as alligators venturing into Miami communities and major highways. In terms of land area, Miami is one of the smallest major cities in the United States. According to the US Census Bureau, the city encompasses a total area of [ 55.27 sqmi km2 on ]. Of that area, [ 35.67 sqmi km2 on ] is land and [ 19.59 sqmi km2 on ] is water. That means Miami comprises over 400,000 people in a mere [ 35 sqmi km2 ], making it one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, along with New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago among others.

Its sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the Tropic of Cancer, and proximity to the Gulf Stream shapes its climate. With January averaging [ 67.2 F ], winter features mild to warm temperatures; cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front, which produces much of the little amount of rainfall.

During this period, temperatures are in the mid 80s to low 90s (29–35 °C), accompanied by high humidity, though the heat is often relieved by afternoon thunderstorm s or a sea breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean, which then allow lower temperatures, but conditions still remain very muggy.

Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County. Tri-Rail, a commuter rail system operated by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA), runs from Miami International Airport northward to West Palm Beach, making eighteen stops throughout Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. Construction is currently underway on the Miami Intermodal Center and Miami Central Station, a massive transportation hub servicing Metrorail, Amtrak, Tri-Rail, Metrobus, Greyhound Lines, taxis, rental cars, MIA Mover, private automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians adjacent to Miami International Airport. Completion of the Miami Intermodal Center is expected to be completed by winter 2011, and will serve over 150,000 commuters and travelers in the Miami area. Phase I of Miami Central Station is scheduled to begin service in the spring of 2012, and Phase II in 2013.

[ Road ] { Venetian Causeway (left) and } { MacArthur Causeway (right) connect } { Downtown and } { South Beach, } { Miami Beach. } Miami&apos;s road system is based along the numerical &quot; Miami Grid &quot; where Flagler Street forms the east-west baseline and Miami Avenue forms the north-south meridian. The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown Macy&apos;s (formerly the Burdine&apos;s headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have &quot; NW &quot; in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown which is close to the coast, therefore, the &quot; NW &quot; and &quot; SW &quot; quadrants are much larger than the &quot; SE &quot; and &quot; NE &quot; quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St ), although, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., Coral Way ), the number is in more common usage among locals. All streets and avenues in Miami-Dade County follow the Miami Grid, with a few exceptions, most notably Coral Gables, Hialeah, and Miami Beach. Some neighborhoods, such as The Roads, is thusly named because its streets run off the Miami Grid in a 45-degree angle, and therefore all named roads. Miami-Dade County is served by four Interstate Highways ( I-75, I-95, I-195, I-395 ) and several U.S. Highways including U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 27, U.S. Route 41, and U.S. Route 441.
