[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1092205 } [ 3 ] Drumright is a city in Creek and Payne counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. It began as an oil boom town. However, the population has declined as oil production has waned in the area. The population was 2,907 at the 2010 census, almost unchanged from 2,905 at the 2000 census. { CensusViewer: Population of the City of Drumright, Oklahoma. } [ History ] The town sprang up nearly overnight in 1912, after wildcatter Tom Slick struck oil on the farm of Frank Wheeler, causing a rush of speculators, oilfield workers, and merchants into the area. The town was named for Aaron Drumright, a farmer and later local businessman whose farm was part of the townsite. { Wilson, Linda D. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. &quot; Drumright. } Drumright and nearby Cushing were at the center of a large, productive oilfield in the 1910s and 1920s. Drumright incorporated as a town on May 27, 1913. It was designated a first-class city after an election on April 18, 1916. The 1920 census reported a population of 6,460. In 1919 a riot broke out in Drumright during a strike by telephone workers. The town&apos;s mayor and chief of police were locked in the town jail by rioters. The Governor of Oklahoma sent six militia units to town to restore order. Beginning with the Depression of the 1930s, the town declined as oil production waned, and a large refinery at the edge of town closed in the 1950s. Today, oil and agriculture are the largest local industries. Drumright is also home to an area vocational and technical school, Central Technology Center, that opened August 22, 1970 and is a large employer. More recently, a winery has opened in a historic building that once served as a school for refinery workers. Tornadoes have caused loss of life and property damage in Drumright on at least two occasions: on April 2, 1956, when five people were killed and several homes, a school, and the public library were damaged; and on June 8, 1974, when 12 people were killed, a nursing home was destroyed, and about 100 homes were damaged or destroyed.
