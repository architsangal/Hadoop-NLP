Similar in structure to a large lymph node, the spleen acts primarily as a blood filter. As such, it is a non-vital organ, with a healthy life possible after removal. The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (also referred to as erythrocytes) and the immune system. { Spleen, } { Internet Encyclopedia of Science } In humans, it is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood in case of hemorrhagic shock while also recycling iron. As a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent erythrocytes. The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin, which is subsequently shuttled to the liver for removal. { Mebius RE, Kraal G. (2005). Structure and function of the spleen. Nat Rev Immunol. 5(8):606-16. PMID 16056254 } It synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria along with antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation. The spleen is brownish. [ Loscalzo, Joseph; Fauci, Anthony S.; Braunwald, Eugene; Dennis L. Kasper; Hauser, Stephen L; Longo, Dan L.

The spleen is 1 &quot; by 3 &quot; by 5 &quot;, weighs approximately 7 oz, and lies between the 9th and 11th ribs on the left hand side. Like the thymus, the spleen possesses only efferent lymphatic vessels. The spleen is part of the lymphatic system. Both the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood. [ Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins 978-0-7817-7076-7 Blackbourne Lorne H Surgical recall 2008-04-01 259 ] The germinal centers are supplied by arterioles called penicilliary radicles. [ http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/penicilliary%2Bradicles Penicilliary radicles Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com 2011-04-03 ] The spleen is unique in respect to its development within the gut. While most of the gut viscera are endodermally derived (with the exception of the neural-crest derived suprarenal gland ), the spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue.

However, it still shares the same blood supply — the celiac trunk — as the foregut organs.

Creation of red blood cells. While the bone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis in the adult, the spleen has important hematopoietic functions up until the fifth month of gestation. After birth, erythropoietic functions cease, except in some hematologic disorders. As a major lymphoid organ and a central player in the reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability to produce lymphocytes and, as such, remains an hematopoietic organ. Storage of red blood cells, lymphocytes and other formed elements. In horses, roughly 30% of the red blood cells are stored there. The red blood cells can be released when needed. In humans, up to a cup (236.5ml) of red blood cells can be held in the spleen and released in cases of hypovolemia. It can store platelets in case of an emergency. Up to a quarter of lymphocytes can be stored in the spleen at any one time. In mice, the spleen stores half the body&apos;s monocyte s so that upon injury they can migrate to the injured tissue and transform into dendritic cell s and macrophage s and so assist wound healing. [ Effect of removal ] [ Asplenia ] Surgical removal causes: modest increases in circulating white blood cell s and platelet s, diminished responsiveness to some vaccine s, increased susceptibility to infection by bacteria and protozoa; in particular, there is an increased risk of sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. A 28-year follow-up of 740 veterans of World War II who had their spleens removed on the battlefield found that those who had been splenectomize d showed a significant excess of mortality from pneumonia (6 rather than the expected 1.3) and a significant excess of mortality from ischemic heart disease (4.1 rather than the expected 3) but not from other conditions. { Robinette CD, Fraumeni JF Jr. (1977).

Authors like Richard Blackmore or George Cheyne employed it to characterise the hypocondriacal and hysterical affections. { Cheyne, George : The English Malady; or, A Treatise of Nervous Diseases of All Kinds, as Spleen, Vapours, Lowness of Spirits, Hypochondriacal and Hysterical Distempers with the Author&apos;s own Case at large, Dublin, 1733. Facsimile ed., ed. Eric T. Carlson, M.D., 1976, Scholars&apos; Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, ISBN 978-0-8201-1281-7; } { Blackmore, Richard : Treatise of the spleen and vapors. London, 1725 } William Shakespeare, in Julius Caesar uses the spleen to describe Cassius&apos; irritable nature. &quot; Must I observe you? must I stand and crouchUnder your testy humour? By the godsYou shall digest the venom of your spleen,Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,I&apos;ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,When you are waspish. &quot; { Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare Act 4:1 } In French, &quot; splénétique &quot; refers to a state of pensive sadness or melancholy. It has been popularized by the poet Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) but was already used before in particular to the Romantic literature (19th century). The word for the organ is &quot; la rate. &quot; The connection between spleen (the organ) and melancholy (the temperament) comes from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks. One of the humours (body fluid) was the black bile, secreted by the spleen organ and associated with melancholy. In contrast, the Talmud (tractate Berachoth 61b) refers to the spleen as the organ of laughter while possibly suggesting a link with the humoral view of the organ. In the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England, women in bad humour were said to be afflicted by the spleen, or the vapours of the spleen. In modern English, &quot; to vent one&apos;s spleen &quot; means to vent one&apos;s anger, e.g. by shouting, and can be applied to both males and females. Similarly, the English term &quot; splenetic &quot; is used to describe a person in a foul mood. [ Variation among vertebrates ] In cartilagenous and ray-finned fish it consists primarily of red pulp and is normally a somewhat elongated organ as it actually lies inside the serosa l lining of the intestine. In many amphibian s, especially frog s, it takes on the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of white pulp. [ Romer, Alfred Sherwood Parsons, Thomas S. 1977 The Vertebrate Body Holt-Saunders International Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 410–411 0-03-910284-X ] In reptile s, birds, and mammal s, white pulp is always relatively plentiful, and in the latter two groups, the spleen is typically rounded, although it adjusts its shape somewhat to the arrangement of the surrounding organs. In the great majority of vertebrates, the spleen continues to produce red blood cells throughout life; it is only in mammals that this function is lost in the adult. Many mammals possess tiny spleen-like structures known as haemal nodes throughout the body, which, it is presumed, have the same function as the spleen proper. The spleens of aquatic mammals are in some ways dissimilar to those of fully land-dwelling mammals. In general, the spleens of aquatic mammals are bluish in colour. In cetaceans and manatees it tends to be quite small, but in deep diving pinnipeds it can be quite massive, owing to its function of storing red blood cells. The only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the lamprey s and hagfish es. Even in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue within the gut wall, which has a similar structure to red pulp, and is presumed to be homologous with the spleen of higher vertebrates.
