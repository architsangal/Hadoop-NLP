[ January 2012 ] [ Shanty town ] A slum, as defined by the United Nations agency UN-HABITAT, is a run-down area of a city characterized by substandard housing and squalor and lacking in tenure security. According to the United Nations, the percentage of urban dwellers living in slums decreased from 47 percent to 37 percent in the developing world between 1990 and 2005. { http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/mdg2007.pdf p. 26 } However, due to rising population, and the rise especially in urban populations, the number of slum dwellers is rising. One billion people worldwide live in slums { Article on Mike Davis&apos;s book &apos;Planet of Slums } and the figure will likely grow to 2 billion by 2030. { Slum Dwellers to double by 2030 UN-HABITAT report, April 2007. } The term has traditionally referred to housing areas that were once relatively affluent but which deteriorated as the original dwellers moved on to newer and better parts of the city, but has come to include the vast informal settlements found in cities in the developing world. { UN-HABITAT 2007 Press Release on its report, &quot; The Challenge of Slums: Global Report on Human Settlements 2003 &quot;. } Many shack dwellers vigorously oppose the description of their communities as &apos;slums&apos; arguing that this results in them being pathologised and then, often, subject to threats of evictions. { See, for instance, the press release from [[Abahlali baseMjondolo ] on the } { Slums Act in South Africa] } Many academics have vigorously criticized UN-Habitat and the World Bank arguing that their &apos;Cities Without Slums&apos; Campaign has led directly to a massive increase in forced evictions. { For instance see the work of Marie Huchzermeyer } Although their characteristics vary between geographic regions, they are usually inhabited by the very poor or socially disadvantaged. Slum buildings vary from simple shacks to permanent and well-maintained structures. Most slums lack clean water, electricity, sanitation and other basic services. The rising phenomenon of slum tourism has western tourists paying to take guided tours of slums. This tourism niche is operating in almost all major slums around the world, including in Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro, Kibera, and Jakarta.

By the 1920s it had become a common slang expression in England, meaning either various taverns and eating houses, &quot; loose talk &quot; or gypsy language, or a room with &quot; low going-ons &quot;. In Life in London Pierce Egan used the word in the context of the &quot; back slums &quot; of Holy Lane or St Giles. A footnote defined slum to mean &quot; low, unfrequent parts of the town &quot;. Charles Dickens used the word slum in a similar way in 1840, writing &quot; I mean to take a great, London, back-slum kind walk tonight &quot;. Slum began to be used to describe bad housing soon after and was used as alternative expression for rookeries. [ Dyos H.J.

[ Wohl Anthony S. The eternal slum: housing and social policy in Victorian London Transaction Publishers 2002 5 http://books.google.com/?id%3D1IgeAuQNm_UC%26amp%3Bdq%3D%22cardinal%2Bwiseman%22%2Bslum 978-0-7658-0870-7 ] Other terms that are often used interchangeably with &quot; slum &quot; include shanty town, favela, skid row, barrio, and ghetto although each of these may have a somewhat different meaning. Slums are distinguished from shanty towns and favelas in that the latter initially are low-class settlements, whereas slums are generally constructed early on as relatively affluent or possibly a prestigious communities. The term &quot; shanty town &quot; also suggests that the dwellings are improvised shack s, made from scrap materials, and usually without proper sanitation, electricity, or telephone services. Skid row refers to an urban area with a high homeless population and a term is most commonly used in the United States. Barrio may refer to an upper-class area in some Spanish -speaking countries and is used to describe only a low-class community in the United States. Ghetto refers to a neighbourhood based on shared ethnicity. By contrast, identification of an area as a slum is based solely on socio-economic criteria, not on racial, ethnic, or religious criteria. [ Characteristics ] { Tai Hang, } { Hong Kong, in the 1980&apos;s } { Dharavi } The characteristics and politics { Politics in the Slum, New York Indymedia, 2008 } associated with slums vary from place to place. Slums are usually characterized by urban decay, high rates of poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment. They are commonly seen as &quot; breeding grounds &quot; for social problems such as crime, drug addiction, alcoholism, high rates of mental illness, and suicide. In many poor countries they exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and lack of basic health care. However, some like Dharavi, Mumbai, are a hive of business activity such as leather work, cottage industries, etc. Rural depopulation with thousands arriving daily into the cities makes slum clearance an uphill struggle. A UN Expert Group has created an operational definition of a slum as an area that combines to various extents the following characteristics: inadequate access to safe water; inadequate access to sanitation and other infrastructure; poor structural quality of housing; overcrowding; and insecure residential status. A more complete definition of these can be found in the 2003 UN report titled &quot; Slums of the World: The face of urban poverty in the new millennium? &quot;. { Slums of the World UN-HABITAT report, downloadable. } The report also lists various attributes and names that are given by individual countries which are somewhat different than these UN characteristics of a slum. { Argentina, located near the center of } { Buenos Aires } Low socioeconomic status of its residents is another common characteristic given for a slum. { Measure Evaluation / NIPORT (2006)Slums of urban Bangladesh: mapping and census, 2005. Centre for Urban Studies / Measure Evaluation / Nationaldiei/pdf/tr-06-35.pdf] } In many slums, especially in poor countries, many live in very narrow alleys that do not allow vehicles (including emergency vehicles ) to pass. The lack of services such as routine garbage collection allows rubbish to accumulate in huge quantities. The lack of infrastructure is caused by the informal nature of settlement and no planning for the poor by government officials. Additionally, informal settlements often face the brunt of natural and man-made disasters, such as landslides, as well as earthquakes and tropical storms. Fires are often a serious problem. { [For more on this see the report on shack fires in South Africa by Matt Birkinshaw at http://abahlali.org/files/Big_Devil_Politics_of_Shack_Fire.pdf] } Many slum dwellers employ themselves in the informal economy. This can include street vending, drug dealing, domestic work, and prostitution. In some slums people even recycle trash of different kinds (from household garbage to electronics) for a living - selling either the odd usable goods or stripping broken goods for parts or raw materials. Slums are often associated with Victorian Britain, particularly in industrial, northern English towns, lowland Scottish towns and Dublin City in Ireland. These were generally still inhabited until the 1940s, when the government started slum clearance and built new council houses. There are still many examples left of former slum housing in the UK, however they have generally been restored into more modern housing.

In April 2005, the director of UN-HABITAT stated that the global community was falling short of the Millennium Development Goals which targeted significant improvements for slum dwellers and an additional 50 million people have been added to the slums of the world in the past two years. { Millenium Development Goals - News, 5 April 2005 } According to a 2006 UN-HABITAT report, 327 million people live in slums in Commonwealth countries - almost one in six Commonwealth citizens. In a quarter of Commonwealth countries (11 African, 2 Asian and 1 Pacific), more than two out of three urban dwellers live in slums and many of these countries are urbanising rapidly. { Comhabitat: Briefing paper produced for the Commonwealth Civil Society Consultation, Marlborough House, London, Wednesday, 15 November 2006 } The number of people living in slums in India has more than doubled in the past two decades and now exceeds the entire population of Britain, the Indian Government has announced. [ http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1805596.ece The Times London Indian slum population doubles in two decades Jeremy Page 2007-05-18 2010-05-23 ] The number of people living in slums is projected to rise to 93 million in 2011 or 7.75 percent of the total population almost double the population of Britain. { http://www.indiavision.com/news/article/national/98404/ } Census data released in December 2011 by the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) shows that in 2010, about 6% of the population lived in slums in Brazil. It means that 11.4 million of the 190 million people lived in the country areas of irregular occupation and lack of public services or urbanization - called by the IBGE of &quot; subnormal agglomerations &quot;. { http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/1024307-censo-mostra-que-6-da-populacao-vive-em-favelas-e-similares.shtml } Many governments around the world have attempted to solve the problems of slums by clearing away old decrepit housing and replacing it with modern housing with much better sanitation. The displacement of slums is aided by the fact that many are squatter settlements whose property rights are not recognized by the state. This process is especially common in the Third World. Slum clearance often takes the form of eminent domain and urban renewal projects, and often the former residents are not welcome in the renewed housing. For example, in the Philippine slums of Smokey Mountain, located in Tondo, Manila, projects have been enforced by the Government and non-government organizations to allow urban resettlement sites for the slum dwellers. { http://www.dailyherald.com/special/philippines/part1.asp } According to a UN-Habitat report, over 20 million people in the Philippines live in slums, { http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20070630-73994/High_transaction_costs,_rent_control_linked_to_RP_slums } and in the city of Manila alone, 50% of the over 11 million inhabitants live in slum areas. { http://home.earthlink.net/~lordprozen/PUF/bahang/state.html#ref4 } { http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/investment-analysis/Housing-Sales-and-Rental-Markets-in-Asia } Moreover new projects are often on the semi-rural peripheries of cities far from opportunities for generating livelihoods as well as schools, clinics etc. At times this has resulted in large movements of inner city slum dwellers militantly opposing relocation to formal housing on the outskirts of cities. See, for example, Abahlali baseMjondolo in Durban, South Africa. Critics argue that slum clearances tend to ignore the social problems that cause slums and simply redistribute poverty to less valuable real estate. Where communities have been moved out of slum areas to newer housing, social cohesion may be lost. If the original community is moved back into newer housing after it has been built in the same location, residents of the new housing face the same problems of poverty and powerlessness. There is a growing movement to demand a global ban of &apos;slum clearance programmes&apos; and other forms of mass evictions. { See [[Robert Neuwirth ]&apos;s article &apos;Squatters and the Cities of Tomorrow&apos;] } [ See also ] [ Variations of impoverished settlements ] Dormitory Favela (slums in Brazil) Gecekondu (slums in Turkey) Ghetto Hooverville (slums in 1930s USA) New Village (slums in Malaysia) Refugee shelter Rookery (Slums in London, United Kingdom) Shanty town Skid row Tent city [ Organizations and concepts ] Abahlali baseMjondolo Homeless Workers&apos; Movement Homeless International Ranjit Naik Slum Dwellers International Slumlord Slum upgrading Squatting United Nations Human Settlements Programme Urban decay [ References ] [ 2 ] [ Further reading ] [ Check digit (3) does not correspond to calculated figure. ] Robert Neuwirth : Shadow Cities, New York, 2006, Routledge Mike Davis (scholar) :Planet of Slums London, New York 2006 ISBN 1-84467-022-8 Elisabeth Blum / Peter Neitzke: FavelaMetropolis.
