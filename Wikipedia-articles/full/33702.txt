Though once abundant over much of Eurasia, North Africa and North America, the gray wolf inhabits a reduced portion of its former range due to widespread destruction of its habitat, human encroachment, and the resulting human-wolf encounters that sparked broad extirpation. Although the species still faces some threats, it is relatively widespread with a stable population trend and has therefore been assessed as Least Concern by IUCN since 2004. [ Mech, L.D., Boitani, L. (IUCN SSC Wolf Specialist Group) 2010 3746 Canis lupus 2011.2 ] Today, wolves are protected in some areas, hunted for sport in others, or may be subject to population control or extermination as threats to livestock, people, and pets. They occur primarily but not exclusively in wilderness and remote areas. The gray wolf has a slender but powerful build. Its head is large and heavy, with wide foreheads, strong jaws and long and blunt muzzles. The ears are relatively small and triangular and the limbs are long and robust, with comparatively small paws. The animal&apos;s size varies depending on the region, with northern wolves being larger. Despite its name, the gray wolf&apos;s coat colour ranges from almost pure white to black. Wolves are social predators that live in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, their offspring and, occasionally, adopted immature wolves. Wolves communicate over long distances by howling. Other forms of communication include growls, barks, whines and various body postures. Wolves primarily feed on ungulate s, which they hunt by wearing them down in short chases. They are typically apex predator s throughout their range, with only human s and tiger s posing significant threats to them. Genetic studies reaffirm that the gray wolf is the ancestor of the domestic dog. A number of other &apos;&apos;Canis lupus&apos;&apos; subspecies have been identified, though the actual number of subspecies is still open to discussion. In areas where human cultures and wolves both occur, wolves frequently feature in the folklore and mythology of those cultures, both positively and negatively. [ Evolution ] { Xiaoming Wang ) } { Montevarchi Paleontological Museum } The most likely ancestral candidate of Canis lupus is Canis lepophagus, a small, narrow skulled North American canid of the Miocene era, which may have also given rise to coyote s. Some larger, broader skulled C. lepophagus fossils found in northern Texas may represent the ancestral stock from which true wolves derive. The first true wolves began to appear at the end of the Blancan North American Stage and the onset of the early Irvingtonian. Among them was Canis priscolatrans, a small species closely resembling the red wolf, which colonised Eurasia by crossing the Bering land bridge. The new Eurasian C. priscolatrans population evolved into Canis etruscus, then Canis mosbachensis. [ Mech Boitani 2003 239–45 ] This primitive wolf closely resembled the modern southern wolf populations of the Arabian Peninsula and South Asia, which were once distributed in Europe in the early Quaternary glaciation until about 500,000 years ago (see Subspecies ). C. mosbachensis evolved in the direction of Canis lupus, and recolonised North America in the late Rancholabrean era. There, a larger canid species called Canis dirus was already established, but it became extinct 8,000 years ago after the large prey it relied on was wiped out. Competition with the newly arrived gray wolf for the smaller and swifter prey that survived may have contributed to its decline. With the extinction of dire wolf, gray wolf became the only large and widespread canid species left. The North American recolonisation likely occurred in several waves, with the most distinctive populations occurring in the periphery of the range. These populations ( C. l. arctos on the high arctic islands, C. l. lycaon in the eastern forests, C. l. baileyi in the far south and C. l. rufus at the continental corner opposite the point of invasion) may represent survivors of early migrations from Eurasia. C. l. baileyi, C. l. lycaon and C. l. rufus display some primitive traits and systematic affinity to one another. Fossil remains from the late Pleistocene of large bodied wolves similar to C. l. arctos and C. l. albus occur in coastal southern California, indicating that large North American gray wolf subspecies were once widespread, and may have been driven southward by glaciation, though wolves no longer reside there. Fossils of small bodied wolves similar to C. l. baileyi have been found in a range encompassing Kansas and southern California. This indicates a late Pleistocene population flux, in which large, Arctic forms of wolf moved farther south, with smaller, warmth adapted wolves expanding as the climate moderated. [ Mech Boitani 2003 245–250 ] The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves which colonised the Korean Peninsula and Japan, before it separated from mainland Asia, 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaidō, thus causing climactic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago. Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island dwarfism 7,000–13,000 years ago in response to these climatological and ecological pressures. C. l. hattai (formerly native to Hokkaidō) was significantly larger than its southern cousin C. l. hodophilax, as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey, as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia. [ Subspecies ] [ Subspecies of Canis lupus ] { Eurasian wolf (&apos;&apos;Canis lupus lupus&apos;&apos;), an example of the &quot; northern &quot; wolf clade } Since 2005, 37 subspecies of wolf are recognised, including the red wolf and not including two Canis lupus subspecies: &apos;&apos;Canis lupus dingo&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Canis lupus familiaris&apos;&apos;. Wolf subspecies are divided into two categories: [ 14000738 ] &quot; Northern wolves &quot; : large-sized, large-brained wolves with strong carnassials which inhabit North America, Europe and northern Asia. { Arabian wolf (&apos;&apos;Canis lupus arabs&apos;&apos;), an example of the &quot; southern &quot; wolf clade } &quot; Southern wolves &quot; : native to North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and South Asia. They are characterised by their smaller size, skull and teeth, and a short and thin coat without appreciable underwool. [ Pocock R.

Canis lupus Taylor and Francis ] They may represent a relict population of early wolves, as they closely resemble fossil European wolves. The rate of changes observed in their DNA sequences date them to about 800,000 years, as opposed to the American and European lineages which stretch back only 150,000. { Sharma, D. K., Maldonaldo, J. E., Jhala, Y. V., Fleischer, R. C. (2003). &apos;&apos;Ancient wolf lineages in India.&apos;&apos; Proceedings of the Royal Society, London B (Supplement) Biology Letters 271: S1–S4. } The vocalisations of southern wolves have a higher proportion of short, sharp barking, [ Hemmer 1990 40 ] and they seldom howl. [ Lopez 1978 15 ] It is likely that dogs and dingo es stem from this group. { Corbett, L. K. (1995). The dingo in Australia and Asia. Comstock/Cornell, ISBN 0-8014-8264-X } Wolves in Central and East Asia are intermediate in form and size to northern and southern wolves. [ Hemmer 1990 38–40 ] Differences in brain size are well defined in different wolf populations, with wolves in northern Eurasia having the highest values, North American wolves having slightly smaller brains, and the southern wolves having the smallest. Southern wolves have brains 5–10% smaller than northern wolves. [ Hemmer 1990 107 ] [ Domestication ] [ Origin of the domestic dog ] { St. Bernard dog and a } { lap dog. Though varied in appearance, domestic dog skulls can be consistently distinguished from wolf skulls by their shortened muzzles, broader palates, crowded teeth and the broad, heavy frontal shields at the top of their skulls. } [ Mech Boitani 2003 257 ] Studies on the genetic distance for mitochondrial DNA on dogs and Eurasian wolves confirmed that wolves are the exclusive ancestral species to dogs. Domestic dogs possess four mtDNA lineages, suggesting four independent domestication events. [ Vila, C. et al. June 13, 1997 Multiple and ancient origins of the domestic dog.

[ Bridgett vonHoldt et al. 2010-03-17 Genome-wide SNP and haplotype analyses reveal a rich history underlying dog domestication Nature 10.1038/nature08837 20237475 464 7290 898–902 harv ] A study by the Kunming Institute of Zoology found that the domestic dog is descended from wolves tamed less than 16,300 years ago south of the Yangtse river in China. [ http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/26/12/2849 mtDNA Data Indicate a Single Origin for Dogs South of Yangtze River, Less Than 16,300 Years Ago, from Numerous Wolves 2010-01-07 Pang et al September 1, 2009 Molecular Biology and Evolution ] Morphological comparisons have narrowed the likely ancestral subspecies of gray wolf to wolves of the Middle Eastern and South Asian variety. The actual domestication process is a source of debate. Although it is popularly assumed that dogs are the result of artificial selection, the general intractability of adult wolves to human handling has led certain experts to theorise that the domestication process occurred through natural selection when Mesolithic human communities began building permanent settlements in which a new ecological niche ( midden s and landfill s ) was opened to wolves. These wolves would have formed a commensal relationship with humans, feeding on their waste over many generations, with natural selection favouring assertive wolves with shorter flight distance s in human presence, and causing physical changes related to the redundancy of features adapted for hunting big game. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 39–67 ] Although dogs are the most closely related canids to gray wolves (the sequence divergence between gray wolves and dogs is only 1.8%, as opposed to over 4% between gray wolves, Ethiopian wolves and coyotes), [ Mech Boitani 2003 225 ] there are a number of physical and behavioural differences. Comparative studies on dog and wolf behaviour and anatomy have shown that dog physiology and most dog behaviours are comparable to those of young wolves, an example of neoteny and pedomorphism. [ Hemmer 1990 83 ] The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in wolves, in contrast to dogs whose bullae are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared to equally sized dogs, wolves tend to have 20% larger skulls and 10% bigger brains. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 54–5 ] The reduction lies in the parts of the brain that deal with sense impressions. [ Zimen 1981 9 ] The teeth of wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs; premolar s and molar s of wolves are much less crowded, and have more complex cusp patterns. [ Clutton-Brock 1987 24 ] Dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland, and most enter estrus twice yearly, unlike wolves which only do so once annually. The forelegs of wolves are closer to each other than those of dogs, with the former&apos;s tracks being further apart. Their tails hang straight or in a slight curve toward the body when neutral, whereas dogs carry their tails in a slight curl. Wolf paws are generally larger than dog paws, { Eckersley, Dominic &apos;&apos;Thyroxine’s Role in the Pre-Domestication of the Dog from Wild Dogs and Wolves; a Unique Opportunity to Reexamine Man’s and Dog’s Migration to the Americas&apos;&apos;, New York City, 2003. } though it is almost impossible to distinguish similarly-sized wolf and dog prints with certainty, though most dogs tend to have rounder paw prints than wolves. [ Zimen 2003 324 ] [ Physical description ] { Abruzzo National Park } [ Anatomy ] Gray wolves are slender, powerfully built animals with large, deeply descending ribcage s and sloping backs. Their abdomens are pulled in, and their necks heavily muscled. Their limbs are long and robust, with comparatively small paws. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 166 ] The front paws have five toes each, while the back paws have four. The forelimbs are seemingly pressed into the chest, with the elbows pointed inward, and the feet outward. [ Mech 1974 ] Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males. [ Lopez 1978 23 ] Wolves are very strong for their size, possessing sufficient strength to turn over a frozen horse or moose carcass. [ Graves 2007 41 ] { Mexican wolf. Note the proportionately larger teeth than the dog&apos;s. } They are also capable of running at speeds of [ 56 - 64 km/h mph 0 ], and can continue running for more than 20 minutes, though not necessarily at that speed. [ Mech Boitani 2003 119 ] In cold climates, wolves can reduce the flow of blood near their skin to conserve body heat. The warmth of the footpads is regulated independently of the rest of the body, and is maintained at just above tissue-freezing point where the pads come in contact with ice and snow. [ Lopez 1978 19–20 ] The intestines of adult wolves measure 460–575  cm, the ratio to body length being 4.13–4.62. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 172 ] The stomach can hold 7–9  kg (15–20  lb) of food and up to 7.5 litres (8 U.S. qt) of water. [ Graves 2007 37 ] The liver is relatively large, weighing 0.7–1.9  kg (1.6–4.2  lb) in males and 0.68–0.82  kg (1.5–1.8  lb) in females. Wolves&apos; heads are large and heavy, with wide foreheads, strong jaws and long, blunt muzzles. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Wolves usually carry their heads at the same level as their backs, raising their heads only when alert. The sagittal and lambdoid crests are well developed, the former dividing just in front of the bregma into two ridges curving outward to form posterior border of postorbital process es. The interorbital region is moderately elevated and well defined, with distinct longitudinal concavity between raised and thickened postorbital processes. [ Miller 1912 309 ] The dental formula is: [ 3.1.4.2 3.1.4.3 ] { golden jackal at } { The Museum of Zoology, } { St. Petersburg. Note the wolf&apos;s larger size and broader muzzle. } The teeth are heavy and large, being better suited to bone crushing than those of other extant canids, though not as specialised as those found in hyena s. { Therrien, F., Mandibular force profiles of extant carnivorans and implications for the feeding behaviour of extinct predators, Journal of Zoology Volume 267, Part 3, November 2005 } [ Mech Boitani 2003 112 ] The canine teeth are robust and relatively short (26  mm). The animal can develop a crushing pressure of perhaps 1,500  lbf/in 2 compared to 750  lbf/in 2 for a German shepherd. This force is sufficient to break open most bones, [ Lopez 1978 26 ] as well as cut through half inch lasso s with one snap. [ Seton 1909 778 ] They generally resemble German shepherds or huskies in bodily configuration, but are distinguishable from them by their orbital angle of 40°–45° rather than 53°–60°, and the greater size of their heads and teeth (see Domestication ). [ Miller 1912 313 ] Compared to coyote s, wolves are larger and have broader snouts, shorter ears, and a proportionately smaller brain case and lack sweat glands on their pawpads. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 15 &amp; 173 ] Compared to golden jackal s, wolves are larger and heavier, and have proportionately longer legs, shorter torsos and longer tails. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 129 ] The teeth are overall less trenchant than the jackal&apos;s, particularly in the upper molars, which have lower cusps, are broader, and are more [ terete ]. [ Miller 1912 318 ] [ Dimensions ] Gray wolves are the largest extant members of the Canidae, excepting certain large breeds of domestic dog. Gray wolf weight and size can vary greatly worldwide, tending to increase proportionally with latitude as predicted by Bergmann&apos;s Rule. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 197 ] Adult wolves are 105–160  cm (41–63  in) in length and 80–85  cm (32–34  in) in shoulder height. The tail is ⅔ the length of the head and body, [ Pocock 1941 80 ] measuring 29–50  cm (11–20  in) in length. The ears are [ 90 - 110 mm in us ] in height, and the hind feet are 220–250  mm. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 174 ] Wolf weight varies geographically; on average, European wolves may weigh [ 38.5 kg lb us ], North American wolves [ 36 kg lb us ], Indian and Arabian wolves [ 25 kg lb us ] [ Lopez 1978 19 ] and North African wolves [ 13 kg lb us ]. [ Obsorn Dale. J. Helmy Ibrahim The contemporary land mammals of Egypt (including Sinai) Field Museum of Natural History http://www.archive.org/details/contemporaryland05osbo 1980 harv ] Females in any given wolf population typically weigh 5–10  lbs less than males. Wolves weighing over 54  kg (120  lbs) are uncommon, though exceptionally large individuals have been recorded in Alaska, Canada, [ Lopez 1978 18 ] and the former Soviet Union. [ Graves 2007 35 ] The heaviest recorded gray wolf in North America was killed on 70 Mile River in east-central Alaska on July 12, 1939 and weighed [ 79.4 kg lb ], while the heaviest recorded wolf in Eurasia was killed after World War II in the Kobelyakski Area of the Poltavskij Region, Ukrainian SSR, and weighed [ 86 kg lb ]. Further more, wolves have reported to weigh as much as [ 90 - 96 kg lb ] in the Soviet Union, though further details are lacking. { Heptner, V.G &amp; Naumov, N.P, (editors) Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol. II Part 1a, SIRENIA AND CARNIVORA (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), Science Publishers, Inc. USA. 1998. ISBN 1-886106-81-9 } [ Fur ] { Pocock &apos;s &apos;&apos;The Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma – Mammalia&apos;&apos; Vol 2 } Gray wolves molt some of their coats in late spring or early summer Gray wolves have very dense and fluffy winter fur, with short underfur and long, coarse guard hair s. Most of the underfur and some of the guard hairs are shed in the spring and grow back in the autumn period. The longest hairs occur on the back, particularly on the front quarters and neck. Especially long hairs are found on the shoulders, and almost form a crest on the upper part of the neck. The hairs on the cheeks are elongated and form tufts. The ears are covered in short hairs which strongly project from the fur. Short, elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs from the elbow s down to the calcaneal tendon s. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 167 ] The winter fur is highly resistant to cold; wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at −40° by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. Wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur, and, as with wolverine s, it does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it. In warm climates, the fur is coarser and scarcer than in northern wolves. Female wolves tend to have smoother furred limbs than males, and generally develop the smoothest overall coats as they age. Older wolves generally have more white hairs in the tip of the tail, along the nose and on the forehead. The winter fur is retained longest in lactating females, though with some hair loss around their nipples. Hair length on the middle of the back is 60–70  mm. Hair length of the guard hairs on the shoulders generally does not exceed 90  mm, but can reach 110–130  mm. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 169 ] Coat colour ranges from almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks. [ Lopez 1978 21 ] Differences in coat colour between sexes are largely absent, [ Heptner Naumov 1998 168 ] though females may have redder tones. [ Lopez 1978 22 ] Fur colour does not seem to serve any camouflage purpose, with some scientists concluding that the blended colors have more to do with emphasizing certain gestures during interaction. [ Lopez 1978 45 ] Black coloured wolves (which occur through wolf-dog hybrid isation ) rarely occur in Eurasia, where interactions with domestic dogs has been reduced over the past thousand years due to the depletion of wild wolf populations. { Anderson et al. Molecular and Evolutionary History of Melanism in North American Gray Wolves Science 6 March 2009: Vol. 323. no. 5919, pp. 1339–1343 } They are more common in North America; about half of the wolves in the reintroduced wolf population in Wyoming&apos;s Yellowstone National Park are black. In southern Canada and Minnesota the black phase is more common than the white, though gray coloured wolves predominate. [ Senses ] Their sense of smell is relatively weakly developed when compared to that of some hunting dog breeds, being able to detect carrion upwind no farther than 2–3  km. Because of this, they rarely capture hidden hares or birds, though they can easily follow fresh tracks. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 243 ] Captive wolves are known to be able to detect what foods their handlers have eaten by smell. [ Ellis 2010 45 ] Their auditory perception is very sharp, being able to hear up to a frequency of 26  kHz, and is greater than that of foxes. Their hearing is sharp enough to register the fall of leaves in the autumn period. The legend that wolves fear the sound of string instrument s may have a basis in fact, as captive wolves in the Regent&apos;s Park Zoo were shown to exhibit signs of intense distress when hearing low minor chords.

[ Behaviour ] [ dog behavior ] [ Social structure ] { Yellowstone National Park } In popular literature, wolf packs are often portrayed as strictly hierarchical social structures with a breeding &quot; alpha &quot; pair which climbs the social ladder through fighting, followed by subordinate &quot; beta &quot; wolves and a low ranking &quot; omega &quot; which bears the brunt of the pack&apos;s aggression. This terminology is based heavily on the behaviour of captive wolf packs composed of unrelated animals, which will fight and compete against each other for status. Also, as dispersal is impossible in captive situations, fights become more frequent than in natural settings. In the wild, wolf packs are little more than nuclear families whose basic social unit consists of a mated pair, followed by its offspring. { Mech, L. David &apos; &amp; #39;Whatever happened to the term alpha wolf?&apos; &amp; #39;, International Wolf, Winter 2008. (PDF). Retrieved on 2011-09-16. } Northern wolf packs tend not to be as compact or unified as those of African wild dog s and spotted hyena s, [ Kruuk, Hans The Spotted Hyena: A study of predation and social behaviour 1972 277–79 0-563-20844-9 Parkwest New York ] though they are not as unstable as those of coyote s. [ http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-079-01-0001.pdf Bekoff, Marc Canis latrans Mammalian Species 79 1–9 1977 ] Southern wolves are more similar in social behaviour to coyotes and dingo es, living largely alone or in pairs. [ Hemmer 1990 96 ] The average pack consists of 5–11 animals; 1–2 adults, 3–6 juveniles and 1–3 yearlings, [ Heptner Naumov 1998 222 ] though exceptionally large packs consisting of 42 wolves are known. Wolf packs rarely adopt other wolves into their fold, and typically kill them. In the rare cases where strange wolves are adopted, the adoptee is almost invariably a young animal of 1–3 years of age, while killed wolves are mostly fully grown. [ Mech Boitani 2003 2 ] The adoption of a new member can be a lengthy process, and can consist of weeks of exploratory, non-fatal attacks in order to establish whether or not the newcomer is trustworthy. [ Ellis 2010 46 ] During times of ungulate abundance (migration, calving etc.), different wolf packs may temporarily join forces. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 225 ] Wolves as young as five months and as old as five years have been recorded to leave their packs to start their own families, though the average age is 11–24 months. Triggers for dispersal include the onset of sexual maturity and competition within the pack for food and breeding. [ Mech Boitani 2003 12–13 ] [ Reproduction ] [ canine reproduction ] { Tama zoo } In areas with low wolf densities, wolves are generally monogamous. [ Mech Boitani 2003 38 ] Mated pairs usually remain together for life if one of the wolves does not die. Upon the death of one mated wolf, pairs are quickly re-established. Since males often predominate in any given wolf population, unpaired females are a rarity. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 248 ] Polygamy does occur, but primarily in captive situations. Multiple litters are rarely successful, due to infanticide by the pack&apos;s females. [ Mech Boitani 2003 59 ] The age of first breeding in wolves depends largely on environmental factors; when food is abundant, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages in order to exploit the newly available resources. Captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9–10 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old. Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one litter annually being the average. Unlike coyotes, wolves never reach reproductive senescence before they die. [ Mech Boitani 2003 175 ] Incest rarely occurs, though inbreeding has been reported in Saskatchewan [ Wolves in national park becoming isolated, say biologists CBC.news.ca http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2005/01/10/wolves-inbreeding050110.html 2008-08-30 2005-01-10 ] and Isle Royale. [ In Long Running Wolf-Moose Drama, Wolves Recover from Disaster Michigan Technological University http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/PressReleases/feature/wolves/wolf.html 2008-08-30 ] Wolf nursing her pups Estrus typically occurs in late winter, with older, multiparous females entering estrus 2–3 weeks earlier than younger females. Before the rut ensues, wolf packs will temporarily dissolve until the end of the mating season. When receptive, females will avert the base of their tails to one side, exposing the vulva. During mating, the pair is locked into a copulatory tie which may last 5–36 minutes. Because estrus in wolves only lasts a month, the males do not abandon their mates to find other females to inseminate as dogs do. During pregnancy, female wolves will remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are more likely. [ Mech Boitani 2003 42–46 ] Old females usually whelp in the den of their previous litter, while younger females typically den near their birthplace. The gestation period lasts 62–75 days, with pups usually being born in the summer period. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 249 ] The average litter consists of 5–6 pups. Litters of 14–17 occur 1% of the time. [ Graves 2007 42 ] Litter sizes tend to increase in areas where prey is abundant. [ Mech Boitani 2003 176 ] Wolves bear relatively large pups in small litters compared to other canid species. [ Mech Boitani 2003 46–49 ] Pups are born blind and deaf, and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur. They weigh 300–500  grams at birth, and begin to see after 9–12 days. The milk canines erupt after one month. Pups first leave the den after 3 weeks. At 1.5 months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young. Unlike wolf mothers, the fathers do not regurgitate the pups&apos; food, but carry them pieces from a kill. If the mother dies prior to the pups&apos; weaning period, they are suckled by the pack&apos;s other females. Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of 3–4 weeks. Pups have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period: a pup&apos;s weight can increase nearly 30 times. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 253–54 ] The reproductive behaviour of introduced wolf packs in Yellowstone is unusual, as they often have multiple breeding females who mate with lone male wolves that encroach upon the pack territories during the mating season. These so called &quot; Casanova wolves &quot; are young males that, having failed to procure mates or territories after leaving their natal pack, mate with the daughters of already established breeding pairs from other packs. Unlike males from established packs, Casanova wolves do not form pair bonds with the females they mate with. Because of the great abundance of prey in Yellowstone, female wolves there can bear multiple litters in this fashion. { Smith, Douglas W. (2006) Decade of the Wolf: Returning the Wild to Yellowstone, Lyons Press, 2006, ISBN 1-59228-886-3 } [ Denning and sheltering behaviour ] Wolves use different places for their diurnal rest; places with cover are preferred during cold, damp and windy weather, while wolves in dry, calm and warm weather readily rest in the open. During the autumn-spring period, when wolves are more active, they willingly lie out in the open, whatever their location. Actual dens are usually constructed for pups during the summer period. When building dens, females make use of natural shelters such as fissures in rocks, cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation. Sometimes, the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes, badgers or marmots. An appropriated den is often widened and partly remade. On rare occasions, female wolves will dig burrows themselves, which are usually small and short with 1–3 openings. Wolves do not line their denning places, a likely precaution against parasites. [ Seton 1909 760 ] The den is usually constructed not more than 500 metres away from a water source. Resting places, play areas for the pups and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens. The odour of urine and rotting food emanating from the denning area often attracts scavenging birds such as magpie s and raven s. As there are few convenient places for burrows, wolf dens are usually occupied by animals of the same family. Though they mostly avoid areas within human sight, wolves have been known to nest near domiciles, paved road s and railway s. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 234–39 ] [ Territorial behaviour ] { marking its territory. } Wolves scent-roll to bring scents back to the pack Wolves are highly territorial animals, and generally establish territories far larger than they require to survive in order to assure a steady supply of prey. Territory size depends largely on the amount of prey available: in areas with an abundance of prey, the territories of resident wolf packs are smaller. Wolf packs travel constantly in search of prey, covering roughly 9% of their territory per day (average 25  km/d or 15  mi/d). The core of their territory is on average [ 35 km2 sqmi on ], in which they spend 50% of their time. [ Territory size of wolves Canis lupus: linking local (Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland) and Holarctic-scale patterns W Jedrzejewski, K Schmidt, J Theuerkauf, BJ edrzejewska and R Kowalczyk harv ] Prey density tends to be much higher in the territory&apos;s surrounding areas. Despite this higher abundance of prey, wolves tend to avoid hunting in the fringes of their territory unless desperate, due to the possibility of fatal encounters with neighboring packs. [ Science 198 Mech, David Wolf-pack Buffer Zones as Prey Reservoirs harv 10.1126/science.198.4314.320 17770508 4314 ] The size of their territory may increase when the pack&apos;s pups reach the age of 6 months, and thus have the same nutritional requirements as adults. The smallest territory on record was held by a pack of six wolves in northeastern Minnesota, which occupied an estimated [ 33 km2 on ]. The largest was held by an Alaskan pack of ten wolves encompassing a [ 6,272 km2 on ] area. In some areas, wolves may shift territories during their prey&apos;s migration season. [ Mech Boitani 2003 19–26 ] Wolves defend their territories from other packs through a combination of scent marking, direct attacks and howling (see Communication ). Scent marking is used for territorial advertisement, and involves urination, defecation and ground scratching. Scent marks are generally left every 240 metres throughout the territory on regular travelways and junctions. Such markers can last for 2–3 weeks, and are typically placed near rocks, boulders, trees or the skeletons of large animals. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 226 ] When scent marking and howling fail to deter strange wolf packs from entering another&apos;s territory, violent interactions can ensue. Territorial fights are among the principal causes of wolf mortality: one study on wolf mortality in Minnesota and the Denali National Park and Preserve concluded that 14–65% of wolf deaths were due to predation by other wolves. [ Causes of wolf mortality in Croatia in the period 1986–2001 Veterinarski Arhiv Đuro Huber Huber Josip Kusak, Alojzije Frković, Goran Gužvica 72 3 131–139 http://www.environmental-studies.de/Wolf_mortality_Croatia.pdf PDF 2007-07-20 harv ] In fact, 91% of wolf fatalities occur within [ 3.2 km mi on ] of the borders between neighboring territories. [ Journal of mammalogy Mech, D 1 February 1994 Buffer zones of territories of gray wolves as regions of intraspecific strife 10.2307/1382251 75 199 00222372 1 L. D. harv 1382251 ] Because the consequences of trespassing can be fatal, such incursions are thought to be largely due to desperation or deliberate aggressiveness. [ Hunting and feeding behaviours ] { American Bison standing its ground, thereby increasing its chance of survival } { elk running, thereby decreasing its chance of survival } Although wolf packs do cooperate strategically in bringing down prey, they do not do so as frequently or as effectively as lion esses do; unlike lions, wolves rarely remain with their pack for more than two years, thus they have less time to learn how to hunt cooperatively. Contrary to lion prides, food acquisition per wolf decreases with pack size. [ Mech Boitani 2003 122 ] Overall, single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. Single wolves have occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose, bison and muskox en unaided. [ Mech Boitani 2003 121 ] When hunting, wolves will attempt to conceal themselves as they approach their prey. With ungulate herds, they then either attempt to break up the herd, or isolate one or two animals from it. [ Graves 2007 43 ] If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running. [ Mech Boitani 2003 120 ] When chasing small prey, wolves will attempt to catch up with their prey as soon as possible. With larger animals, the chase is prolonged, in order to wear the selected prey out. Wolves usually give up chases after 1–2  km (0.62–1.3  mi), though one wolf was recorded to chase a deer for [ 21 km mi on ]. Sometimes, a single wolf will distract the herd with its presence, acting as a decoy, while its pack mates attack from behind. Wolf packs may also set up ambush trails; Indian wolves have been observed to chase gazelle herds through ravines where other wolves lie in wait within holes dug prior to the hunt, { &apos; &amp; #39;NATURAL HISTORY OF THE MAMMALIA OF INDIA AND CEYLON&apos; &amp; #39; by Robert A. Sterndale, THACKER, SPINK, AND CO. BOMBAY: THACKER AND CO., LIMITED. LONDON: W. THACKER AND CO. 1884. Gutenberg.org (2006-10-16). Retrieved on 2011-09-16. } while Russian wolves will set up ambushes near water hole s, sometimes using the same site repeatedly. Both Russian and North American wolves have been observed to drive prey onto crusted ice, precipices, ravines, slopes and steep banks to slow them down. Mature wolves usually avoid attacking large prey frontally, instead focusing on the rear and sides of the animal. They kill large prey by biting large chunks of flesh from the soft perineum area, causing massive blood loss. Such bites can cause wounds 10–15  cm in length, with three such bites to the perineum usually being sufficient to bring down a large deer in optimum health. [ Graves 2007 45 ] When attacking moose, they occasionally bleed it to death by biting its soft nose. [ Graves 2007 46 ] With medium-sized prey such as roe deer or sheep, northern wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the carotid artery, thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute. [ Zimen 1981 217–218 ] Southern wolves may grab the animal by the neck and stun it by jerking its head downward, hitting its nose on the ground. When prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally surplus kill. Such instances are common in domestic animals, but rare in the wild. In the wild, surplus killing primarily occurs during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey) [ Mech Boitani 2003 144 ] or during the denning period, when wolves require a ready supply of meat when denbound. [ Lopez 1978 54–55 ] Medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method by which they are killed allows wolves to quickly kill one animal and move on to another. Surplus killing may also occur when adult wolves are teaching their young to hunt. [ Graves 2007 67 ] The breeding pair typically monopolizes food in order to continue producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially pups. [ Ellis 2010 50 ] [ Mech Boitani 2003 58 ] This is in marked contrast to the feeding behaviours of some other canids like dhole s, who give priority to their pups when feeding. { Fox, Michael W. (1984) The Whistling Hunters: Field Studies of the Indian Wild Dog (Cuon alpinus), p.86-7, State University of New York Press, ISBN 0-87395-862-4 } The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family will tear off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscle s. [ Mech Boitani 2003 122–5 ] [ Communication ] An Arabian wolf in a defensive posture [ Body language ] Postural communication in wolves is composed of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. [ Lopez 1978 43 ] Aggressive or self assertive wolves are characterised by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. [ Mech Boitani 2003 90 ] When breeding males encounter subordinate family members, they may stare at them, standing erect and still with their tails horizontal to their spine. [ Lopez 1978 44 ] The pre-caudal scent glands may play a role in expressing aggression, as combative wolves will raise the base of their tails whilst drooping the tip, thus positioning the scent glands at the highest point. [ Seton 1909 773 ] Two forms of submissive behaviour are recognised: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf&apos;s face. [ Mech Boitani 2003 93 ] { UK Wolf Conservation Trust. } When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviours such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other&apos;s muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display. Dominant wolves may assert themselves by straddling over a subordinate family member. [ Lopez 1978 47 ] At a kill, wolves will protect the carcass from afar from other wolves by flattening their ears outwardly, thus indicating that they are covering something belonging to them. [ Ellis 2010 51 ] [ Howling ] [ Wolf howls.ogg Wolves howling Ogg ] [ rallying.ogg Rallying cry Ogg ] Wolves howl to assemble the pack (usually before and after hunts), to pass on an alarm (particularly at a den site), to locate each other during a storm or unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances. Howling consists of a fundamental frequency which may lie between 150 and 780  Hz, and consists of up to 12 harmonically related overtones. The pitch usually remains constant or varies smoothly, and may change direction as many as four or five times. Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions; the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable. The two are however mutually intelligible, as North American wolves have been recorded to respond to European-style howls made by biologists. [ Zimen 1981 73 ] Wolf howls are generally indistinguishable from those of large dogs. [ Seton 1909 770 ] Male wolves give voice through an octave, passing to a deep bass with a stress on &quot; O &quot;, while females produce a modulated nasal baritone with stress on &quot; U &quot;. Pups almost never howl, while yearling wolves produce howls ending in a series of dog-like yelps. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 262 ] Howls used for calling pack mates to a kill are long, smooth sounds similar to the beginning of the cry of a horned owl. When pursuing prey, they emit a higher pitched howl, vibrating on two notes. When closing in on their prey, they emit a combination of a short bark and a howl. When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are. [ Lopez 1978 38 ] Lone wolves typically avoid howling in areas where other packs are present. [ Mech Boitani 2003 16 ] Wolves do not respond to howls in rainy weather and when satiated. [ Other vocalisations ] Other vocalisations of wolves are usually divided into three categories: growls, barks and whines. [ Lopez 1978 39–41 ] Barking has a fundamental frequency between 320–904  Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or conti nuously as dogs do, but will bark a few times and retreat from perceived danger. In captivity, wolves may learn to bark more often if they hear dogs doing so. [ Mivart 1890 5 ] Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450  Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing. [ Ecology ] [ Diet ] Wolves primarily feed on medium to large sized ungulate s (up to the size of bison 10–15 times larger than themselves [ Zimen 2003 9–10 ] ), though they are not fussy eaters. Medium and small sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmot s, beaver, hare s, badger s, fox es, weasel s, ground squirrel s, mice, hamster s, vole s and other rodent s, as well as insectivore s. They frequently eat waterfowl (particularly during their moulting period and winter, when their greasy and fatty meat helps wolves build up their fat reserves) and their eggs. When such foods are insufficient, they will prey on lizard s, snake s, frog s, rarely toad s and large insect s as available. In times of scarcity, wolves will readily eat carrion, visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter house s. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 213 ] Wolf packs in Astrakhan will hunt Caspian seal s on the Caspian Sea coastline. [ Graves 2007 75 ] Some wolf packs in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon.

[ Heptner Naumov 1998 214 ] { Klein, D. R. 1995. The introduction, increase, and demise of wolves on Coronation Island, Alaska. Pages 275–280 in L. N. Carbyn, S. H. Fritts, and D. R. Seip, editors. Ecology and conservation of wolves in a changing world. Canadian Circumpolar Institute, Occasional Publication No. 35. } However, they are not known to eat their young as coyotes sometimes do. [ Seton 1909 761–2 ] Human s are rarely, but occasionally preyed upon (see Attacks on humans ). [ Linnell 2002 ] [ Heptner Naumov 1998 267–68 ] [ Pocock 1941 94 ] Wolves will supplement their diet with fruit and vegetable matter; they willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apple s and pear s. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. Wolves can survive without food for long periods; two weeks without food will not weaken a wolf&apos;s muscle activity. In Eurasia, many wolf populations are forced to subsist largely on livestock and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goat s, fallow deer and musk deer. [ Mech Boitani 2003 107 ] The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall&apos;s sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou. [ Mech Boitani 2003 109 ] In North Africa, wolves feed on various cultivated crops and vegetables and domestic animals. [ Enemies and competitors ] { brown bear in Juraparc, } { Vallorbe, Vaud, } { Switzerland. } Wolves typically dominate other canid species in areas where they both occur. In North America, incidences of wolves killing coyote s are common, with such incidences being especially common in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills. Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing the pups. They rarely eat the coyotes they kill. There are no records of coyotes killing wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them.

[ Heptner Naumov 1998 114–115 ] Wolves also kill red, arctic and corsac fox es, usually in disputes over carcasses. They may eat the foxes they kill. [ Mech Boitani 2003 269 ] [ Heptner Naumov 1998 357, 455 &amp; 545 ] In Asia, they may compete with dhole s. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 585 ] Brown bear s are encountered by wolves in both Eurasia and North America. Generally, the outcome of such encounters depends on context: brown bears typically prevail against wolf packs in disputes over carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites. While a brown bear is much larger and more powerful than a single wolf, wolves can match them via their strength in numbers. Both species will kill each other&apos;s young. Wolves will eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves. [ Mech Boitani 2003 261–63 ] American black bear s occur solely in the Americas. Wolf interactions with black bears are much rarer than with brown bears, due to differences in habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species&apos; northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears (mainly cubs) in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. [ Mech Boitani 2003 263–64 ] While encounters with brown and black bears appear to be common, polar bear s are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs.

[ Heptner Naumov 1998 730 ] When attacking bears in daylight, wolf packs have been known to harry their quarry and wait till nightfall before making the final assault, as wolves have better night vision than bears. [ Ellis 2010 39 ] Wolves may encounter striped hyena s in Israel and Central Asia, usually in disputes over carcasses. Hyena s feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses in areas where the two species interact. On a one-to-one basis, hyenas dominate wolves, though wolf packs can drive off single hyenas. [ M. G. L. Mills Gus Mills Heribert Hofer Hyaenas: status survey and conservation action plan http://books.google.com/books?id%3DaO2gTeLBLZYC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA24 16 September 2011 January 1998 IUCN 978-2-8317-0442-5 24–25 ] Large wolf populations limit the numbers of small to medium sized felines. Wolves encounter cougar s along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges. Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations. In winter however, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, interactions between the two species become more likely. Although they rarely interact, wolves and cougars will kill each other, with packs of the former sometimes usurping the latter&apos;s kills. [ Mech Boitani 2003 264–65 ] They hunt steppe cat s, and may pose a threat to snow leopard s. { Heptner, V. G. &amp; Sludskii, A. A.

[ Lopez 1978 29 ] [ Heptner Naumov 1998 255 ] [ Mech Boitani 2003 265 ] In areas where wolves and tigers share ranges, such as the Russian Far East, the two species typically display a great deal of dietary overlap, resulting in intense competition. Wolf and tiger interactions are well documented in Sikhote-Alin, which until the beginning of the 20th century, held very few wolves. It is thought by certain experts that wolf numbers increased in the region after tigers were largely eliminated during the Russian colonization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This is corroborated by native inhabitants of the region claiming that they had no memory of wolves inhabiting Sikohte-Alin until the 1930s, when tiger numbers decreased. Tigers depress wolf numbers, either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem. Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human persecution decreases the latter&apos;s numbers. Today wolves are considered scarce in tiger inhabited areas, being found in scattered pockets, and usually seen traveling as loners or in small groups. First hand accounts on interactions between the two species indicate that tigers occasionally chase wolves from their kills, while wolves will scavenge from tiger kills. Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks appear to be competitive rather than predatory in nature, although there are four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them. { Miquelle, D.G., Stephens, P.A., Smirnov, E.N., Goodrich, J.M., Zaumyslova, O.Yu. &amp; Myslenkov, A.I. 2005. &apos;&apos;Tigers and Wolves in the Russian Far East: Competitive Exclusion, Functional Redundancy and Conservation Implications&apos;&apos;. In Large Carnivores and the Conservation of Biodiversity. Ray, J.C., Berger, J., Redford, K.H. &amp; Steneck, R. New York: Island Press. pp. 179–207. } This competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters in the Far East to tolerate the big cats, as they limit ungulate populations less than wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter&apos;s numbers. { Fulbright, Timothy E. &amp; Hewitt, David G.

They can produce viable offspring, with all subsequent generations being fertile, as opposed to coydog s and jackal-dog hybrid s. { Feddersen-Petersen, Doris, Hundepsychologie, 4. Auflage, 2004, Franck-Kosmos-Verlag 2004 } The captive breeding of wolf-dog hybrids has proliferated in the United States, with 300,000 such animals being present there. The most commonly used dog breeds for this purpose are of the spitz group. { Cusdin, P. A. The Keeping of Wolf-Hybrids in Great Britain, [[RSPCA ] 2000] } Although wolves normally kill dogs, lone wolves may fraternise with guard or herding dogs as surrogate pack members. [ Graves 2007 10 ] [ Zimen 2003 363–370 ] Most wolf-dog matings in the wild involve female wolves soliciting male dogs. Wolf-hybrids may be bolder than pure wolves, and thus more dangerous to livestock and human life. In the wild, hybrids may preferentially associate and mate with dogs and other hybrids and live on the periphery of human settlements more readily. [ Graves 2007 32 &amp; 52–3 ] Although wolf-dog hybridisation in Europe has raised concern among conservation groups fearing for the wolf&apos;s purity, an analysis on the mtDNA sequences show that introgression of dog genes into European wolf populations does not pose a significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small. { Vilà, Carles &amp; Wayne, Robert K., &apos;&apos;Hybridization between Wolves and Dogs&apos;&apos;, Conservation Biology, Pages 195–198, Vol. 13, No. 1. February 199 } Like pure wolves, hybrids breed annually, though their mating season occurs 3 months earlier, with pups mostly being born in the winter period, thus lessening their chances of survival. Although it is popularly believed that some Inuit tribes mate their sled dogs to wolves in order to improve their stamina, this is probably untrue, as wolf hybrids are generally unable to cooperate effectively in pulling harnesses, and their stamina is much less than that of sled dogs. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 186 ] At least two wolf-dog breeds have been created in Europe, the Saarlooswolfhond and the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog, both by crossing wolves with German shepherds. The red wolf is thought by some scientists to be a wolf/coyote hybrid. [ Coywolves ] [ Coywolf ] The offspring is generally intermediate in size to both parents, being larger than a pure coyote, but smaller than a pure wolf. A study showed that of 100 coyotes collected in Maine, 22 had half or more wolf ancestry, and one was 89 percent wolf. A theory has been proposed that the large eastern coyotes in Canada are actually hybrids of the smaller western coyotes and wolves that met and mated decades ago as the coyotes moved toward New England from their earlier western ranges. [ Eastern Coyotes Are Becoming Coywolves David Zimmerman Caledonian-Record http://ncmg.blogspot.com/2005/07/coy-dogs-maybe-not.html 2010-02-01 ] These eastern coyote populations also have fewer sweat glands in their pawpads than western coyotes, but have more than wolves.

Strong evidence for hybridization was found through genetic testing which showed that red wolves have only 5% of their alleles unique from either gray wolves or coyotes. Genetic distance calculations have indicated that red wolves are intermediate between coyotes and gray wolves, and that they bear great similarity to wolf/coyote hybrids in southern Quebec and Minnesota. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA showed that existing red wolf populations are predominantly coyote in origin. [ The red wolf (Canis rufus) – hybrid or not?

[ IUCN Red List – Canis Lupus ] Wolves tend to have difficulty adapting to human induced changes, and are often referred to as an indicator species; a species delineating an ecoregion or indicating an environmental condition such as a disease outbreak, pollution, species competition, or climate change. Wolves do not seem to be able to adapt as readily to expanding civilization the way coyotes do. While human expansion has seen an increase in the latter&apos;s numbers, it has caused a drop in those of the former. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 23 ] Beyond the environmental factors of human encroachment on natural habitats effecting wolf populations, wolves are have suffered as one of the world&apos;s most widely persecuted wild animals. Wolves have been readily killed on sight, for the reasons of gathering their furs, out of competition for ungulate prey, for protection of livestock and human lives (although, in areas where healthy populations of prey exist, wolves rarely attack livestock and even more seldomly attack humans) or for pleasure, the latter reason fueled by the view of many people of wolves as loathsome and bloodthirsty. Despite not being at risk for extinction, local populations of wolves are still threatened. One such threat is genetic bottlenecking caused by population fragmentation.

With the exception of Great Britain and Ireland, wolves were widespread in Europe during the 18th century. Wolves were exterminated from all central and northern European countries during the 19th century and the post World War II period. Remnant populations remain in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and Finland, though Eurasian wolves have been recovering naturally in several parts of Europe; recolonising France, Germany, Sweden and Norway.

Limiting factors in member nations include a lack of acceptance of wolves (particularly in areas where they have made a comeback) due to concerns on livestock and dog predation and competition with hunters. Although properly regulated wolf harvests and control have been largely accepted as compatible with maintaining wolf numbers to economically acceptable levels, overhunting and poaching are recognised as the main limiting factor in European wolf populations. { Salvatori, V. &amp; Linnel, J.

The Arabian Peninsula is home to an estimated 300–600 wolves which, though hunted year round in all Middle Eastern countries except Israel, are relatively stable and protected by the inaccessibility of the northern mountains and central and northern deserts. In India, wolves are classed as endangered, and number an estimated 800-3,000 individuals scattered among several remnant populations. In China and Mongolia, wolves are not protected except in reserves. [ Mech Boitani 2003 326–8 ] Wolves once ranged over much of North America north of Mexico City.

In the contiguous United States, wolves were almost completely extirpated by the turn of 20th century including every state east of Michigan where they were once distributed. { (2011). } Canadian and Alaskan wolves number in thousands and remain in excellent biological condition. Wolves have expanded from Canada to the northern Rocky Mountains some since the 1970s, establishing themselves southward in the northern portions of Montana, Washington, Idaho and Wyoming. In 1994, wolves from Alberta and British Columbia were captured and introduced into Yellowstone National Park, where they had been extinct since the 1930s. A similar introduction took place in 1998 in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona. [ Mech Boitani 2003 321–4 ] A small, isolated group of wolves on Isle Royale is believed to be suffering from the effects of reduced genetic variability. In 1991, the population was reduced from 50 to 12 wolves. Studies have shown that this reduction has coincided with a 50% loss of allozyme heterozygosity. [ Conservative Biology Wayne, R.K., et al.

Infectious diseases spread by wolves include brucellosis, tularemia, listeriosis and anthrax. Wolves may also suffer from rabies : wolves are a major host for the disease in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and India. Canine distemper seems to only pose a serious problem for wolves in Canada and Alaska. [ Mech Boitani 2003 209 ] Wolves also carry the Canine coronavirus, with infections being most prevalent in winter months. [ http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/37/4/740.pdf Serologic survey for canine coronavirus in wolves from Alaska, Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 37(4), 2001, pp. 740–745, Wildlife Disease Association 2001 PDF 2010-03-16 ] However, gray wolf populations are remarkably [ May 2012 ] resilient against disease outbreaks. Usually, a wolf displaying the first symptoms of disease will leave its pack, thus preventing the sickness from spreading to its pack mates [ May 2012 ]. Wolves in the former Soviet Union have been recorded to carry over 50 different parasite species. [ Graves 2007 77–85 ] Tick s carried by wolves include Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor pictus. Although wolves are host to Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite) they rarely develop full blown mange, unlike foxes. Other ectoparasite s include biting lice, sucking lice and the flea s Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis. Endoparasite s include nematode s such as Toxascaris leonina and T. canis. Wolves are also carriers of Trichinella spiralis, the prevalence of which is significantly related to age. [ http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/35/1/94.pdf Trichinella sp. in Wolves from Interior Alaska, Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 35(1), 1999, pp. 94–97, Wildlife Disease Association 1999 PDF 2010-03-16 ] Other endoparasites include cestode s such as Taenia pisiformis, T. hydatigena, Echinococcus granulosus, Mesocestoidea lineatus, Dioctophyme renale and the adult phase of Multiceps multiceps. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 254–55 ] Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock; infected animals being three to thirteen times more likely to abort than those not infected.

In Norse and Japanese mythology, wolves were portrayed as almost god-like. In Japan, grain farmers worshiped wolves at shrines and left food offerings near their dens, beseeching them to protect their crops from wild boars and deer, while the wolf Fenrir of Norse mythology was depicted as the son of Loki. Certain cultures portrayed wolves as part of their foundation myth s. In Roman mythology, the Capitoline Wolf nurses the future founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus. In the mythology of the Turks, { André Wink. Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World. Brill Academic Publishers, 2002. ISBN 0-391-04173-8. Page 65. } Mongols and Ainu, wolves were believed to be the ancestors of their race, [ Walker, Brett L. The Lost Wolves Of Japan 2005 0-295-98492-9 ] while the Dena’ina believed wolves were once men, and viewed them as brothers. [ Mech Boitani 2003 292 ] Wolves were linked to the sun in some Eurasian cultures. The Ancient Greeks and Romans associated wolves with the sun god Apollo, while the wolf Sköll in Norse mythology was depicted pursuing the setting sun. { Lindow, John, Norse mythology: a guide to the Gods, heroes, rituals, and beliefs, Oxford University Press US, 2002, ISBN 0-19-515382-0 } Wolves were sometimes associated with witchcraft in both northern European and some Native American cultures. In Norse mythology, the völva (witch) Hyndla and the giantess Hyrrokin are both portrayed as using wolves as mounts. In Navajo culture, wolves were feared as witches in wolf&apos;s clothing. [ Lopez 1978 123 ] Similarly, the Tsilhqot&apos;in believed that contact with wolves could cause mental illness and death. According to the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf was the first animal to experience death. [ Lopez 1978 133 ] According to the Avesta, wolves are a creation of the evil spirit Ahriman, and are ranked among the most cruel of animals. { Yasna, ix. 18–21 } Wolves are referenced thirteen times in the Bible as symbols of greed and destructiveness. [ Bright, Michael Beasts of the Field: The Revealing Natural History of Animals in the Bible 2006 115–20 1-86105-831-4 Robson Books London ] [ Livestock and dog predation ] { Charles Marion Russell, depicting wolves harassing a steer } Livestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation. As well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. [ Mech Boitani 2003 305 ] However, certain wolves may become &quot; addicted &quot; to livestock, as the stomach lining of domestic ungulates has a higher calorific value than that of wild herbivores [ May 2012 ]. [ Ellis 2010 173–74 ] The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period. Untended livestock in remote pastures are the most vulnerable to wolf predation. [ Mech Boitani 2003 307 ] Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. [ Mech Boitani 2003 309 ] Sheep are the most commonly taken livestock species in Europe, domestic reindeer in northern Scandinavia, cattle and turkey s in North America, goat s in India and horse s in Mongolia. As wolves tend to attack large prey from behind, cattle may be more vulnerable to wolves than horses because the latter are better able to defend their hind quarters with powerful kicks. [ Harding 1909 38–39 ] Different subspecies of wolf may preferentially target different animals: small bodied wolves rarely molest adult cattle, while large northern wolves are able to kill fully grown steers and sometimes horses unaided. [ Roosevelt 1909 185–86 ] The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. [ Mech Boitani 2003 306 ] Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they will occasionally break into fenced enclosures. Injuries caused by wolves on large bodied livestock include docked ears and tails, as well as slash wounds on the lower legs. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock in order to negatively affect them; the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriage s, decreased weight gain, and a decrease in meat quality. Wolves will kill dogs on occasion, with some wolf populations relying on dogs as an important food source. Wolves generally outmatch dogs, even large ones, in physical confrontations, because of their larger heads and teeth and stronger bites. [ Roosevelt 1909 192–3 ] [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 134–5 ] Also, the fighting styles of wolves and dogs differ significantly; while dogs typically limit themselves to attacking the head, neck and shoulder, wolves will make greater use of body blocks, and attack the extremities of their opponents. [ Lindsay 2000 18 ] In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. On village outskirts, wolves may set up ambushes for dogs, with one wolf soliciting the dog to follow it and lead it to another wolf. [ Graves 2007 36 ] In some areas, livestock guardian dog s are fitted with wolf collar s in order to protect themselves from wolf attacks. Wolves however may learn to avoid the spiked collars just as they do the antlers of ungulate prey, and still kill guard dogs. [ Ellis 2010 170–71 ] Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin. { Backeryd, Jessica (2007) &apos;&apos;Wolf attacks on dogs in Scandinavia 1995 – 2005: Will wolves in Scandinavia go extinct if dog owners are allowed to kill a wolf attacking a dog?&apos;&apos;, Examensarbete i ämnet naturvårdsbiologi 20 poäng } The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are harrier s, with older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react differently to the presence of wolves. Wolf-caused injuries on dogs are often located on the back, thighs and hindlegs. The fatal wound is mostly a bite to the back of the neck. Large hunting dogs such as Swedish elkhound s are more likely to survive wolf attacks due to their better ability to defend themselves. [ Attacks on humans ] [ Wolf attacks on humans ] { Alfred Wierusz-Kowalski } Wolves are generally not dangerous to humans, as long as they are in low numbers, have sufficient food, have little contact with humans and are occasionally hunted. { Geist, Valerius (2006) &apos;&apos;When do Wolves become Dangerous to Humans?&apos;&apos;, The University of Calgary } The number of people attacked and killed by wolves varies geographically. Wolf attacks on humans were a rare, but occasional feature of life in pre-20th century Europe: among one of the earliest historic references to wolves attacking people in Ireland occurs in the Annals of Tigernach under the year 1137: The Blind one of... that is, Giolla Muire, was killed by wolves. Under the year 1420 in the Annála Connacht is the statement &quot; Wolves killed many people this year. &quot;. In France, historical records indicate that during the period 1580–1830, 3,069 people were killed by wolves, of whom 1,857 were killed by non-rabid wolves. [ Moriceau, Jean-Marc Histoire du méchant loup : 3 000 attaques sur l&apos;homme en France 2007 2-213-62880-7 Fayard Paris ] Church and administrative accounts from Italy indicate that 440 humans were killed by wolves during the 15th and 19th centuries, occurring in the central part of the Po Valley, which once encompassed part of modern day Switzerland. { Cagnolaro L., M. Comencini, A. Martinoli, A. Oriani, 1996. &apos;&apos;Dati storici sulla presenza e su casi di antropofagia del lupo nella Padania centrale&apos;&apos;. In F.

A. 1997 Sex and age structure of people attacked by wolves in different seasons. Proceedings of the scientific conference [Issues of applied ecology, game management and fur farming], 27–28 May 1997, Kirov p-143-146 } while between 1944 and 1950, 22 children between the ages of 3 and 17 were killed by wolves in the Kirov Oblast (see Kirov wolf attacks ).

Edited by Patrick Valkenburg and Mark McNay) PDF 2012-01-26 ] There are numerous documented accounts of wolf attacks in the Asian continent, with three India n states reporting a large number of non-rabid attacks in recent decades. These attacks were well documented by trained biologists. [ Linnell 2002 26 ] In Hazaribagh, Bihar, 100 children were injured and 122 killed from 1980 to 1986. { Rajpurohit, K.S. 1999. Child lifting: Wolves in Hazaribagh, India. Ambio 28:162–166. } The North American continent has very few recorded incidences of such, though the oral history of some Native American tribes confirms that wolves occasionally did kill humans. Tribes living in woodlands feared wolves more than their tundra-dwelling counterparts, as they could encounter wolves suddenly and at close quarters. [ Lopez 1978 69 &amp; 123 ] It is thought that the reason why so few attacks are recorded in North America than in Eurasia is linked to the former&apos;s historically greater availability of firearms, whose usage taught North American wolves to fear humans more than their Eurasian counterparts. [ Roosevelt 1909 185 ] [ Seton 1909 767 ] [ Graves 2007 8 ] However, encounters with aggressive wolves in North America seem to be on the increase. One study revealed 80 events in Alaska and Canada where wolves closely approached or attacked people, finding 39 cases of aggression by apparently healthy wolves, and 29 cases of fearless behavior by nonaggressive wolves. { McNay, Mark A Case History of Wolf-Human Encounters in Alaska and Canada (2002), Alaska Department of Fish and Game Wildlife Technical Bulletin. Wildlife.alaska.gov. Retrieved on 2011-09-16. } Recorded incidences of rabid wolves in Eurasia go far back as the 13th century. The number of cases of rabid wolves are however low when compared to other species. Wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can catch it from other animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Cases of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and Central Asia. Wolves apparently develop the &quot; furious &quot; phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, make rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals, [ Linnell 2002 14 ] with bites from rabid wolves being 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 267 ] Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attack generally only lasts a day. [ Linnell 2002 15 ] Also, the victims are chosen at random, though the majority of cases involve adult men. [ Linnell 2002 37 ] Predatory attacks usually involve single wolves or packs that learn to exploit humans as prey. Such attacks may be preceded by a long period of habituation, in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans. [ Linnell 2002 36 ] The victims are generally attacked in a sustained manner around the neck and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are disturbed. Such attacks tend to cluster in time and space until the offending animals are killed. Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June–August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock grazing or berry and mushroom picking) increase, though cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in Belarus, the Kirovsk and Irkutsk districts, Karelia and Ukraine. [ Heptner Naumov 1998 268 ] Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period. The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women. Non-rabid wolves are able to distinguish between armed and unarmed people, [ Heptner Naumov 1998 244 ] and will typically avoid investigating people who display self confident demeanors typical of being armed. Wolves may react aggressively in self defense, though such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities, and the attacks are not pressed. [ Linnell 2002 16 ] [ Hunting ] [ Wolf hunting Wolf hunting with dogs ] Wolf hunt on skis Mounted cowboys roping a wolf in Wyoming, 1887 Wolves are notoriously difficult to hunt due to their elusiveness, their sharp senses, their high endurance in the chase and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill hunting dogs. [ Roosevelt 1909 182 &amp; 192 ] Historically, many methods have been devised to hunt wolves. [ Harding 1909 ] [ Graves 2007 121–40 ] In areas where wolves are a threat to livestock, the destruction of spring-born litters in their dens is a sure way of keeping wolf populations to a minimum. [ Harding 1909 65–75 ] When hunting wolves with dogs, usually combinations of sighthound s, bloodhound s and fox terrier s are used. The sighthounds chase and immobilise wolves until the arrival of the heavier dogs which do most of the fighting. [ Harding 1909 76–85 ] Still hunting of wolves (alternately walking quietly and waiting concealed in the pursuit of game) is primarily practised in areas where the terrain is too rough for hunting with dogs, [ Harding 1909 86–98 ] though wolves are almost as hard to hunt with this method as cougars are. Because of their sharp hearing, wolves are almost impossible to stalk, even when asleep. Poisoning with strychnine was once practised, but is now generally unpopular, as it can cause the unintentional deaths of animals other than wolves, and wolves generally learn to recognise and avoid poisoned baits. [ Harding 1909 99–108 ] The ideal time for wolf poisoning was during the late summer and early autumn period, when pups were more likely to stray from their mothers and consume objects which they had yet to learn to avoid. [ Seton 1909 766 ] Foothold traps are effective, as long as no long lasting human odours are present on them. [ Harding 1909 109–23 ] Many Native American tribes favoured deadfall trap s in capturing wolves. [ Lopez 1978 108 ] Wolf traps are sometimes accompanied by scents (usually beaver or musk deer musk and wolf urine) or baits ( venison or horse meat ). [ Harding 1909 124–132 ] Traps however are not foolproof; because of their excellent vision, wolves can detect the flaws in hidden traps, even at night, and wolves with prior experience of being trapped can teach their young to avoid them. [ Seton 1909 764 ] Hunting blind s can be effective against wolves, though they are seldom used, as their use requires much patience. [ Harding 1909 189–95 ] A popular method of wolf hunting in Russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with flag poles carrying a human scent. This method relies heavily on the wolf&apos;s fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the smell. [ Graves 2007 121 ] Some hunters are able to lure wolves by imitating their calls, a method which is especially useful in winter and the mating season. [ Graves 2007 122 ] In Kazakhstan and Mongolia, wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practise is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. [ Graves 2007 124 ] Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, as it allows greater visibility of wolves than hunting on the ground, [ Graves 2007 125–36 ] though this method is controversial, as it allows wolves little chance to escape or defend themselves. [ Lopez 1978 159–60 ] [ Fur use ] { fur coat } Wolf pelts are primarily used for scarf s and the trimming s of women&apos;s garments, though they are occasionally used for jacket s, short cape s, coat s, mukluk s and rugs. The quality of wolf peltries rests on the density and strength of the fur fibre, which keeps the fur upright and gives the pelt an appealing bushy aspect. These characteristics are mostly found in northern wolf populations, but gradually lessen further south in warmer climates. North American wolf pelts are among the most valuable, as they are silkier and fluffier than Eurasian peltries. [ Bachrach, M. Fur: a practical treatise 1953 206–13 Prentice-Hall, New York ] The pelts of wolves killed by poison are mostly worthless. [ Harding 1909 108 ] In Medieval Europe, pelts were considered the only practical aspect of wolves, though they were seldom used, due to the skin&apos;s foul odour. [ Griffin, Emma Blood sport: hunting in Britain since 1066 2007 65 0-300-11628-4 Yale University Press ] In Scandinavian folklore, wolf-skin girdle s assisted in transforming the wearers into werewolves. { Woodward, Ian The Werewolf Delusion (1979) p. 121, Paddington Press Ltd. ISBN 0-448-23170-0 } Several Native American tribes used wolf pelts for medicinal purposes, though some Inuit tribes favour dog skin over wolf skin, as the latter is thinner, and more prone to tearing when sewn. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 55 ] The Pawnee wore wolf skins as capes when exploring enemy territories. [ Lopez 1978 111–2 ] The United States Army used wolf skin for parka s during the later stages of WWII and the Korean War to protect the faces of soldiers from frostbite. In the Soviet Union, between 1976 and 1988, 30,000 wolf pelts were produced annually. Recent statistics from CITES indicate that 6,000–7,000 wolf skins are internationally traded each year, with Canada, the former Soviet Union, Mongolia and China being the largest exporters, and the United States and Great Britain being the largest importers. Overall, the harvesting of wolves for their fur has little impact on their population, as only the northern varieties (whose numbers are stable) are of commercial value. [ Mech Boitani 2003 329 ] Wolf trapping for fur remains a lucrative source of income for many Native Americans. [ Wolves as pets ] [ Wolves as pets and working animals ] Captive wolves following hand gestures at the Wolf Science Center in Austria Keeping wolves as pets has grown in popularity. In the United States alone, there are an estimated 80,000-2 million privately owned wolves. Tame wolves tend to be less predictable and manageable than dogs. [ Mech Boitani 2003 304 ] While dogs typically alter their behaviours to accommodate their handlers, the opposite is true for tame wolves. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 43 ] While dog pups still have the ability to be socialised at up to ten weeks of age, nineteen days may be too long to wait to begin socializing a wolf pup. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 42 ] Because wolf milk contains more arginine than can be found in puppy milk substitute s, an arginine supplement is needed when feeding pups below the weaning age. Failure to do so can result in the pups developing cataract s. [ Mech Boitani 2003 197 ] Wolves lack any alteration of their predatory behaviour, and can thus not be fully trusted in situations where their prey drive can be given adequate stimulation. In contrast to dogs, which are usually accepting of strangers, treating them almost as an extension of their pack, wolves become increasingly xenophobic and intolerant of strangers not part of their immediate pack as they age. While dogs readily, and actively form social bonds with humans, wolves can only do so in the absence of adult conspecifics. [ Lindsay 2000 20 ] Pups under one year of age are generally not aggressive toward strangers, though their aggression increases with age, particularly during the mating season. Males may be more aggressive and difficult to handle than females. Wolves are difficult to contain in standard kennel s, as they exceed dogs in observational learning and are able to quickly learn how to undo latch es by simply watching their handlers do so. [ Coppinger Coppinger 2001 46–7 ] Once wolves learn how to escape confinement, it becomes near impossible to contain them. [ Lindsay 2000 19 ] Though wolves are trainable, they lack the same degree of tractability seen in dogs. They are generally not as responsive as dogs are to coercive techniques involving fear, aversive stimuli and force. Generally, far more work is required to obtain the same degree of reliability seen in most dogs. Even then, once a certain behavior has been repeated several times, wolves may get bored and ignore subsequent commands. Wolves are most responsive toward positive conditioning and rewards, [ http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section7.html Are wolves and wolfdog hybrids trainable?
