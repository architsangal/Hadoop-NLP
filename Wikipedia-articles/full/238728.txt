Web. 24 Aug. 2011. } { &quot; Lita Ford. &quot; Almanac of Famous People. Gale, 2011. Gale Biography In Context. Web. 24 Aug. 2011. } is a British-born, American rock musician and singer who was the lead guitarist for The Runaways and achieved popularity for her solo career between the 1980s and early 2010s. [ Early life ] Lita Ford was born Lita Rossana Ford to a British father and an Italian mother in London, England. She moved with her family to the United States at the age of 4 and began playing the guitar at the age of 11. Her vocal range is mezzo-soprano. [ Martin Bill Pro Secrets Of Heavy Rock Singing Sanctuary Publishing 2002 9 1-86074-437-0 ] In 1975 at the age of 16 she joined the all-female rock band The Runaways, for whom she played lead guitar. They then scored a record deal and released their first album in 1976. [ The Runaways ] It was not long before the all-girl formation caught the eye of the media. Lita Ford&apos;s guitar skills made her a driving force in the band and a permanent member from her arrival to the band&apos;s eventual break-up. In 1979, disagreements were erupting within the band, who had since parted ways with producer Kim Fowley, lead singer Cherie Currie and bassist Jackie Fox. Rhythm guitarist Joan Jett wanted the band to shift more towards Ramones -influenced punk music while Ford and drummer Sandy West wanted to continue playing hard rock -oriented songs. { Sherman, Dale. 20th Century Rock And Roll : Women In Rock. Collector&apos;s Guide Publishing, inc, p53 } With neither side being able to compromise, the band finally broke up that year. [ Solo career ] After the group split in 1979, Ford began a solo career. Her first album Out for Blood as well as the title single were released in 1983 and failed on the charts. The next effort, 1984&apos;s Dancin&apos; on the Edge achieved moderate success. It included the single &quot; Fire In My Heart &quot; which reached the Top 10 in several countries but not the US. The next single &quot; Gotta Let Go &quot; was one of Ford&apos;s biggest hits. It reached Number One on the Mainstream Rock charts. Ford toured extensively and made several guest appearances on TV shows for the next four years, but had no releases; a follow-up to Dancin&apos; On The Edge, titled The Bride Wore Black, was abandoned and never released because Ford did not like the production of the album and this upset the head of her record label, leading to Ford switching from Mercury Records to RCA Records. The artist has described the album as being in &quot; Label hell! Who knows what shelf that is sitting on! &quot; { Trunk, Russel A.; &quot; Lita Ford: Desert Island Diva &quot;, Exclusive Magazine } Ford performing on the 19th December 1988 in the &quot; Olympiahalle &quot; venue of Munich, Germany. By the time Ford returned again, the lighter pop-metal she had long favoured had broken through to mainstream audiences, which set the stage for her most commercially successful album, 1988&apos;s Lita. With Sharon Osbourne as her manager, and again produced by herself, the album featured four commercial hits, including &quot; Kiss Me Deadly &quot;, &quot; Back To The Cave &quot;, &quot; Close My Eyes Forever &quot;, and &quot; Falling In And Out Of Love &quot; (co-written with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe ). The ballad &quot; Close My Eyes Forever &quot;, a duet with Sharon&apos;s husband Ozzy Osbourne, was her only Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit, reaching #8. Her next release was called Stiletto. It featured the singles &quot; Hungry &quot; and &quot; Lisa &quot; (the second was dedicated to her mother). However this album was not as successful as Dancin&apos; On The Edge and Lita. Ford&apos;s next release was Dangerous Curves, which featured her last charting single &quot; Shot Of Poison &quot;. Ford&apos;s last release would be with ZYX Records and would be titled Black. It failed to repeat the success of 1991&apos;s Dangerous Curves. During her solo years, she was an endorser of B.C. Rich guitars and used Warlock, Eagle, Mockingbird and Bich single and double-neck models. Ford appears in the 1992 film Highway to Hell as &apos;The Hitchhiker&apos;. Ford was also asked by VH-1 to be in the cast of The Surreal Life for its 7th season, in 2007. She declined. [ Return to stage, new album and tour 2008-2009 ] In June 2008, Ford and her new solo band played several warm-up gigs prior to Rocklahoma under the name Kiss Me Deadly in the New York City area. [ http://www.eddietrunk.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/NAA/cdid/402306/pid/401816 Eddie Trunk Eddie Trunk 2011-10-09 ] In June 2009, she began touring the US and Europe, with a new line-up consisting of Ron &apos;Bumblefoot&apos; Thal ( Guns N&apos; Roses guitarist, 2006–present) on guitar, Dennis Leeflang (Bumblefoot drummer) and PJ Farley on bass ( Trixter, Ra) and Michael T. Ross ( Angel / XYZ ). Ford released a new album Wicked Wonderland on 6 October 2009 via JLRG Entertainment.

I don’t know what’s popular, or the flavour of the day. I just wanted the music to ROCK! The lyrics are very personal and that’s it. I wasn’t going to come out in sandals with hairy armpits! &quot;. [ http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id%3D1017 Exclusive Magazine 2010-09-05 Russell A. Trunk Lita Ford - ‘Desert Island Diva!’ ] Ford contributed her likeness and voice to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 video game, Brütal Legend. She appears as the character Rima, alongside Jack Black, Tim Curry, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Halford, and Lemmy Kilmister. Her song &quot; Betrayal &quot; is also one of the 100+ songs that appear in the game. In 2010, Ford was portrayed by actress Scout Taylor-Compton in the movie The Runaways. In May 2011 Ford promised a &quot; real comeback album &quot; later in the year, saying the last one, Wicked Wonderland, recorded with Jim Gillette (to whom she was married at the time) was too much of a collective project. &quot; A lot of people have told me that they want a real Lita album, and I know what they mean. They are going to get it, &quot; she said. { LITA FORD: New Video Interview Posted Online. - May 17, 2011. } [ Personal life ] In the mid-1980s, Ford was romantically involved with, and briefly engaged to, guitarist Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. [ IMDB Page- Tony Iommi http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0409546/bio 7/26/11 ] [ Lita Ford History: Sleaze Roxx http://www.sleazeroxx.com/bands/fordlita/litaford.shtml 7/26/11 ] He co-produced her album The Bride Wore Black, which to date remains unreleased. Ford said in a 1989 Kerrang! interview, &quot; there&apos;s a certain amount of bad blood between Tony Iommi and I. &quot; Ford married former Nitro singer Jim Gillette in 1994, after knowing each other for two weeks. They have two sons, James and Rocco Gillette. The family moved to Turks and Caicos, where Gillette has a successful building and real estate developing business.

In a March 2011 interview on the Classic Rock Revisited website, Ford claimed that she had taken a business trip to Los Angeles to discuss the reality show with TLC executives, and returned home to find her husband and sons not speaking to her. She also claimed that her sons physically attacked her, egged on by Gillette, which was when she decided to divorce Gillette and cancel the reality series.

It is awarded to two players who can get a 100 note streak in cooperative mode. Ford lent her appearance and likeness to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 videogame Brütal Legend as Rima, Queen of the Zaulia beast-riders. In addition, the character Lita Halford was named after both Ford and Rob Halford, who also provides a voice in the game.
