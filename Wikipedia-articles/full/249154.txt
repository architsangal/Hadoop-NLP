[ the chocolate company Laura Secord Chocolates ] { Valiants Memorial in Ottawa. } Laura Ingersoll Secord (September 13, 1775 – October 17, 1868) was a Canadian heroine of the War of 1812. She is known for warning British forces of an impending American attack that led to the British victory at the Battle of Beaver Dams. [ Early life ] Laura Ingersoll was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in 1775. Following the aftermath of the American Revolution, her father, Thomas Ingersoll, who had supported the loyalists, moved his family to Canada in 1795, reportedly in hopes of regaining his lost family fortune. In 1797 Laura married a United Empire Loyalist, James Secord, son of an officer of Butler&apos;s Rangers. The couple resided in Queenston, Upper Canada (present-day Ontario), while her family went on to settle present day Ingersoll, Ontario.

Laura went searching for James and was tending his wounds when they encountered a trio of U.S. soldiers, two raising their muskets intending to dispatch the prone sergeant. Captain John E. Wool of the 13th U.S. Infantry happened on the scene, preventing the attack. Wool and James Secord would remain life-long friends. &lt; ref name=Graves on Lundy&apos;s Lane &gt; Some Graves on Lundy&apos;s Lane. Niagara Historical Society.

On the evening of June 21, Laura became aware of plans for a surprise American attack on British troops led by Lieutenant James FitzGibbon at Beaver Dams, which would have furthered American control in the Niagara Peninsula. While her husband was still suffering the effects of his injury from the previous October, Laura set out early the next morning to warn the Lieutenant herself, reportedly walking roughly [ 20 miles km ] from present day Queenston through St. David&apos;s, Homer, Shipman&apos;s Corners (present-day St. Catharines ) and Short Hills at the Niagara Escarpment before arriving at the camp of allied Native warriors who led her the rest of the way to FitzGibbon&apos;s headquarters at the Decew house. A small British force and a larger contingent of Mohawk warriors were then readied for the American attack with the result that most of the American forces were casualties or taken prisoner in the ensuing Battle of Beaver Dams. [ January 2012 ] [ The legend ] Secord&apos;s account of her trek changed throughout her life. Pierre Berton noted that she was never entirely clear on how she learned of the impending attack. She told FitzGibbon that her husband had learned it from an American officer, but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard plans directly after being forced to house and feed, i.e. quarter, American soldiers in Queenston. Ironically, the issue of forcible quartering of British soldiers is held to be one of the major bones of contention which led to the American Revolution. [ Berton Pierre Flames across the border: The Canadian-American tragedy, 1813–1814. Little, Brown Boston 1981 ] Berton has suggested Secord&apos;s informant could have been an American still resident in the United States, who would have been charged with treason had Secord revealed her source. It is more likely that the American soldiers, who were housed on British Colony soil in a house owned by a patriot of the British Colony, simply had no regard for security and the protection of vital information that was being talked about by the soldiers much too freely. Historian Marsha Ann Tate notes that retellings of the story have diverged quite significantly in everything but the most basic details of the story.

The History Teacher 38.2 http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/38.2/tate.html ] In the 1860s, as the story of Laura Secord gained prominence, historian William Foster Coffin invented new details including the claim that Laura had brought a cow with her as an excuse to leave her home in case of questioning by American patrols. { Laura Secord profile at Galafilm } Other versions hold that she left under the guise of visiting a sick relative in neighbouring St. David&apos;s, and that she walked barefoot for much of the journey. The question of Secord&apos;s actual contribution to the British success has been contested. In the early 1920s, historians suggested that Native scouts had already informed FitzGibbon of the coming attack well before Secord had arrived on June 23. { Wood, W. Select British documents of the Canadian war of 1812, Vol. I of the Toronto: Champlain Society, 1920-1928, pp. 65-66. } Later still, two earlier testimonials by FitzGibbon (written in 1820 and 1827) were found which supported Secord&apos;s claim. FitzGibbon asserted that Laura Secord had arrived on June 22 (not the 23rd), and that, &quot; in consequence of this information &quot;, he had been able to intercept the American troops. { McKenzie, Ruth. Profile of Laura Secord, &apos;&apos;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&apos;&apos; } [ Later life ] Over the years, Laura Secord and James FitzGibbon petitioned the government in request of some kind of acknowledgment but to no avail. Finally, in 1860, when Laura was 85, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII ), heard of her story while traveling in Canada. At Chippawa, near Niagara Falls, he was made aware of Laura Secord&apos;s plight as an aging widow and later sent an award of £100. It was the only official recognition that she received in her lifetime. [ December 2009 ] Laura and James Secord attended Holy Trinity Church in the Village of Chippawa (part of present-day Niagara Falls, Ontario ) where their grave markers are presently located, as well as a few relics of the family. Laura Secord died in 1868 at the age of 93. She was interred next to her husband in the Drummond Hill Cemetery in Niagara Falls. Her grave is marked by a monument with a bust of Laura on top (cast by the Bureau Brothers of Philadelphia) close to that marking the Battle of Lundy&apos;s Lane. A cup and saucer from the family are displayed at Lundy&apos;s Lane Historical Museum in Niagara Falls, Canada. [ Legacy ] [ 43.16395 N 79.05523 W ] { Historic house museum } Secord&apos;s historical reputation began to rise with the publication of Sarah Anne Curzon &apos;s verse drama, Laura Secord: The Heroine of 1812, in 1887. The play was responsible for &quot; a deluge of articles and entries on Secord that filled Canadian histories and school textbooks at the turn of the 20th century. &quot; { Kym Bird, Sarah Anne Curzon profile at Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig), Dominion Institute online, May 5, 2011. } { Queenston Heights } [ Laura Secord homestead ] Laura Secord&apos;s restored homestead at 29 Queenston St, Queenston, Ontario is a museum near the bank of the Niagara River, with a commemorative plaque in front. The original home in Queenston has been rebuilt to the original floor plan including the original fireplaces. A monument to Secord was erected on Queenston Heights ( [ 43.160315 N 79.051084 W ] ). [ Acton Free Press Monument to Memory of Laura Secord 27 June 1901 3 ] Secord&apos;s grave marker at Drummond Hill Cemetery ( [ 43.08941 N 79.09576 W ] ) is inscribed: To perpetuate the name and fame of Laura Secord, who walked alone nearly 20 miles by a circuitous difficult and perilous route, through woods and swamps and over miry roads to warn a British outpost at DeCew’s Falls of an intended attack and thereby enabled Lt. FitzGibbon on the 24th June 1813, with less than 50 men of H.M. 49th Regt., about 15 militiamen and a small force of Six Nations and other Indians under Capt. William Johnson Kerr and Dominique Ducharmes to surprise and attack the enemy at Beechwoods (or Beaver Dams) and after a short engagement, to capture Col. Bosler of the U.S. Army and his entire force of 542 men with two field pieces.
