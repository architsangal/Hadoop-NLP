It is not a typical shield volcano. In addition to erupting basalt ic lavas, it also has erupted andesitic and even rhyolitic lava. The volcano is [ 20 mi 0 ] in diameter and has an approximate volume of [ 80 cumi ]. It possesses a large oval-shaped caldera [ 4 xx 5 mi km ] in diameter, called the Newberry Caldera. Within the caldera there are two lakes ( Paulina Lake and East Lake ), many pyroclastic cone s, lava flow s, and obsidian domes. A deep gash in the northern caldera wall, dubbed &quot; The Fissure &quot;, is the end of a [ 29 mi on ] long series of fractures called the Northwest Rift Zone. Approximately 6,100 years ago, fissure basalt flows erupted from the rift and covered part of Newberry&apos;s northwest flank. Newberry Volcano was named for John Strong Newberry, who explored central Oregon for the Pacific Railroad Surveys in 1855. [ McArthur McArthur 2003 ] {. } During the Apollo program, parts of the volcano that resemble the Moon &apos;s surface were used to train the astronaut s. [ October 2010 ] [ Geology ] Progression of ages of rhyolitic (silicic) lavas and calderas from McDermitt Caldera to Newberry and Yellowstone calderas (red circles: MC, NC, &amp; YC). Numbers are ages in millions of years. KBML - Klamath—Blue Mountains Lineament, HLP - High Lava Plains, EDZ - Eugene—Denio Zone, BFZ - Brothers Fault Zone, SMF - Steens Mountain Fault, VF - Vale Fault, NNR - North Nevada Rift. White arrow shows direction of North American plate, edge of the craton is approximately along the Oregon—Idaho Border, triangles are Cascades volcanoes. The Newberry Volcano lies at the northwest end of both the Brothers Fault Zone, and the High Lava Plains (area of blue lines on diagram at right) of volcanic features in central Oregon that have been developing since about 16 Ma. Volcanism in the High Lava Plains is bimodal, having both basaltic (mafic) and rhyolitic (silicic) types of lava. Some of the rhyolites show a progression in ages from about 10 Ma in the east to the geologically recent Newberry Caldera in the west. This track, and its implication of a moving source, roughly mirrors the similar track of the Yellowstone Hotspot from the McDermitt Caldera on the Oregon—Nevada border, on which basis the Newberry volcanism has been attributed to a so-called hotspot (a plume of hot material arising from the earth&apos;s mantle). But whereas the Yellowstone Hotspot reflects the motion of the North American plate across a hotspot, the Newberry track does not. Although the cause of the intense regional volcanism around 16 Ma is hotly debated, { See www.MantlePlumes.org for a taste of the debate. } the age progression across the High Lava Plains is now attributed to a reservoir of hot material that expanded over time, and the linearity of the trend attributed to exploitation of a deep, pre-existing weakness in the crust associated with the Brothers Fault Zone. [ Walker 1974 ] {; } [ Walker Nolf 1981 ] {; } [ Jordan others 2004 ] {; } [ Camp Ross 2004 ] {; } [ Xue Allen 2006 ] {. } A great deal of volcanic activity has occurred on Newberry&apos;s shield, which itself has one of the largest collections of cinder cone s, domes, lava flow s, and fissures in the world—so much so that local residents call these parasitic vents the &quot; Paulina Mountains &quot;, thinking of them as a separate mountain range. Most of the cinder cones are [ 200 to 400 ft -1 ] high and have shallow saucer-shaped summit craters. They are typically surrounded by basalt or andesite that erupted from their bases forming large lava beds. The northern flank holds three distinct lava tube systems that formed in pāhoehoe : the Horse Lava Tube System, Arnold Lava Tube System, and the Lava Top Butte basalt. [ Champion 2002 ] {; } [ Donnelly-Nolan 2004 ] {; Oregon High Desert Grotto. } On the northwest flank of the volcano is Lava Butte, located next to Highway 97 south of Bend, is a good example of this kind of cinder cone and an a ā lava bed. There are also about 20 rhyolite domes or fissures on the eastern, southern, and western flanks. Larger examples include 580,000-year-old McKay Butte on the west flank, 80,000-year-old China Hat and 850,000-year-old East Butte on the far eastern base. During the late Pleistocene and Holocene periods, there have been six eruptive episodes. Four of them rhyolitic, on the eastern half of the caldera, and two basalt ic, on the flanks. [ 5.6 mi 0 ] [ 1.1 sqmi 1 ] South Obsidian Eruptive Episode: An estimated 12,000 years ago, an obsidian dome and related obsidian flow erupted in the southeast part of the caldera. East Rim Eruptive Episode: About 11,200 years ago (10,000 14 C years B.P. ), mafic cinder s, scoria, spatter, and lava flows erupted from a fissure on the east rim of the caldera. Interlake Eruptive Episode: A series of rhyolitic eruptions began in the caldera approximately 7,300 years ago (6,200 14 C years B.P.). They produced a widespread phreatomagmatic pumiceous tephra deposit, obsidian flows, large and small pumice cones, and a pumice ring. This eruptive episode probably lasted for about 200 years. Northwest Rift Eruptive Episode: About 7,000 years ago (6,100 14 C years B.P.), basaltic andesite lava and cinder cones erupted from extensive fissure vents on the northwest and south flanks of Newberry. Spatter and cinders also erupted from a fissure on the north caldera wall. The lava flows range up to long and are more voluminous at lower elevations. This eruptive episode probably lasted for less than 50 years. East Lake Eruptive Episode: About 3,500 years ago, obsidian flows and associated pumice deposits in the caldera erupted from caldera ring fractures. Big Obsidian Eruptive Episode: About 480 A.D. (1,470 14 C years B.P.), a three-part sequence of rhyolitic eruptions began which included an air-fall tephra, ash-flow tephra, and an obsidian flow from a common vent at the base of the south caldera wall. The initial Plinian eruption 480 A.D. (1,580 14 C years B.P.) produced the Newberry pumice fall deposit which blanketed the east flank of the volcano and areas to the east. About 210 years later, the Paulina Lake ash flow (1,310 14 C years B.P.) spread from near the south caldera wall to Paulina Lake. The final phase of the eruption produced the Big Obsidian Flow, which covers. Newberry&apos;s highest point is located [ 1500 ft -1 ] above the southern caldera floor on Paulina Peak, which is just one peak on the caldera rim. The volcano&apos;s south flank descends into the basaltic flatlands of central Oregon. [ Caldera ] Map of Newberry Volcano and surroundings Newberry Caldera has existed possibly as long as 500,000 years, when the cone of the volcano is thought to have first collapsed. Subsequent caldera-forming collapse events have further deepened the caldera but volcanic material and lake-bed sediment s have largely filled in much of this depth. Within the caldera, there are two lakes (Paulina Lake and East Lake), many cinder cone s, lava flows, and obsidian domes. The land area of the caldera is often heavily forest ed, except in areas where there are more recent volcanic flows and features. Paulina Lake is drained by Paulina Creek, which passes through a narrow gorge through the western part of the caldera rim. East Lake does not have a known outlet and is [ 40 ft 0 ] higher than Paulina Lake. 6700-year-old basalt flows separate the two caldera lakes. Rising [ 700 ft -1 ] above this flow is the Central Pumice Cone. Both lakes have hot spring s, and drilling in 1981 found that temperatures in the caldera reach [ 280 °C 2 ] at [ 3057 ft 0 ] below the caldera floor. This is the highest temperature ever recorded at a dormant Cascade volcano, hotter than even The Geysers of California, the world&apos;s largest producer of geothermal power. Newberry has had a caldera for possibly as long as 500,000 years, when a large Plinian Eruption sent so much pyroclastic material gushing from its vent that the then-emptied magma chamber collapsed. This was repeated for several eruptions; each forming a slightly smaller caldera. The half-million-year-old (estimated) Teepee Draw tuff covers much of the volcano&apos;s shield and was from an eruption with an estimated volume of [ 10 cumi 0 ]. This is thought to be the first in a series of caldera-forming eruptions that issued from Newberry&apos;s main vent system. One of the later layers is cut by Newberry&apos;s only stream, Paulina Creek. Subsidence of the caldera through time has been partly offset by the deposition of tephra, lava flows, and lake sediment. The USGS has drilled [ 3057 ft m ] below the present surface of the caldera and has found that: [ 950 ft -1 ] [ 950 - 1180 ft 0 ] [ 1180 - 1640 ft 0 ] [ 1640 - 2449 ft 0 ] [ 2449 - 3057 ft 0 ] First : Dominated by air-fall pumice, obsidian flows, and under-water erupted ash. : Lake-bottom sediments. : Thick layers of pumice-rich ash and breccia. : Rhyolitic to dacitic lava flows. : Basalt to basaltic- andesite lava flows and breccia. There are several large flows of obsidian in the caldera, one of which, Big Obsidian Flow, was created around 1400 years ago and is thus the most recent caldera eruption. This particular flow erupted from a vent or fissure near the southern wall of the caldera and partially engulfed the Lost Lake pumice ring.
