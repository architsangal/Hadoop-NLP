[ Mellow Gold studio Beck MellowGold.jpg March 1, 1994 1993 Alternative rock, anti-folk, lo-fi, alternative country 47:36 DGC Beck Hansen, Tom Rothrock, Rob Schnapf, Karl Stephenson Stereopathetic Soulmanure (1994) Mellow Gold(1994) One Foot in the Grave (1994) ] Mellow Gold is the third studio album by American alternative rock musician Beck, as well as his major label debut. Mellow Gold was released on March 1, 1994 (see 1994 in music ) on the strength of the surprise hit &quot; Loser &quot; (U.S. #10). Informed by the irreverent Gen X slacker and punk -influenced anti-folk styles of his earlier independent work, critics noted its hybrid of styles and ironic, witty lyrics. The decidedly anti-commercial attitude of Mellow Gold unexpectedly became a commercial success, and the album went platinum. In an effort to get the album into stores such as Wal-Mart and Kmart, which do not stock albums with a &quot; parental advisory sticker &quot;, a &quot; clean &quot; version of the album was released. Nonetheless, Wal-Mart carried the explicit version of the album with sticker, thought the move is believed to have been an unintentional oversight. Mellow Gold reached #13 in the U.S., and #41 in the UK. As of July 2008, Mellow Gold has sold 1.2 million copies in the United States.
