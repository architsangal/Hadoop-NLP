It contains most of the cell&apos;s genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of protein s, such as histone s, to form chromosome s. The gene s within these chromosomes are the cell&apos;s nuclear genome. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression  — the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and unifies its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nucleoskeleton (which includes nuclear lamina ), a meshwork within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole. Because the nuclear membrane is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pore s are required to allow movement of molecules across the envelope. These pores cross both of the membranes, providing a channel that allows free movement of small molecules and ion s. The movement of larger molecules such as proteins is carefully controlled, and requires active transport regulated by carrier proteins. Nuclear transport is crucial to cell function, as movement through the pores is required for both gene expression and chromosomal maintenance. The interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of subnuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosome s. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA. [ History ] { Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, 1719. } [[Image:Flemming1882Tafel1Fig14.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a Chironomus salivary gland cell published by Walther Flemming in 1882. The nucleus contains Polytene chromosome s.]]The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632  – 1723). He observed a &quot; Lumen &quot;, the nucleus, in the red blood cell s of salmon. { Leeuwenhoek, A. van: Opera Omnia, seu Arcana Naturae ope exactissimorum Microscopiorum detecta, experimentis variis comprobata, Epistolis ad varios illustres viros.

ISBN 978-3-8171-1781-9. } Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still possess nuclei.The nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer in 1804 [ Harris H The Birth of the Cell 1999 Yale University Press New Haven 0-300-07384-4 ] and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in a talk at the Linnean Society of London. Brown was studying orchid s under microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the areola or nucleus, in the cells of the flower&apos;s outer layer. [ Brown Robert On the Organs and Mode of Fecundation of Orchidex and Asclepiadea Miscellaneous Botanical Works I 511–514 1866 ] He did not suggest a potential function. In 1838, Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name &quot; Cytoblast &quot; (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around &quot; cytoblasts &quot;. Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the &quot; cytoblast &quot; or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak (1852) and Rudolf Virchow (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells ( &quot; Omnis cellula e cellula &quot; ). The function of the nucleus remained unclear. [ Cremer Thomas Von der Zellenlehre zur Chromosomentheorie 1985 Springer Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, Tokyo 3-540-13987-7 ] { Online Version here } Between 1877 and 1878, Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel &apos;s theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a &quot; Monerula &quot;, a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( &quot; Urschleim &quot; ). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, e.g., amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants (1884). This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was developed. [ Structures ] The nucleus is the largest cellular organelle in animals. [ Lodish H Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology WH Freeman 5th 2004 New York 0-7167-2672-6 ] In mammal ian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometers (μm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. [ 2002 Molecular Biology of the Cell, Chapter 4, pages 191–234 Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, Peter Walter Garland Science 4th ] The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm, and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus. [ Clegg JS Properties and metabolism of the aqueous cytoplasm and its boundaries Am. J. Physiol. 246 2 Pt 2 R133–51 1984 February 6364846 http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dreprint%26amp%3Bpmid%3D6364846 ] It appears as a dense, roughly spherical organelle. [ Nuclear envelope and pores ] [ Nuclear envelope Nuclear pores ] ribosome -studded double membranes of the nuclear envelope, the DNA (complexed as chromatin ), and the nucleolus. Within the cell nucleus is a viscous liquid called nucleoplasm, similar to the cytoplasm found outside the nucleus. nuclear pore on the surface of the nuclear envelope (1). Other diagram labels show (2) the outer ring, (3) spokes, (4) basket, and (5) filaments. The outer envelope, otherwise known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometers (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell&apos;s genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecule s from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. [ Paine P, Moore L, Horowitz S Nuclear envelope permeability Nature 254 5496 109–114 1975 1117994 10.1038/254109a0 ] The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. [ WERNER W. FRANKE, ULRICH SCHEER, GEORG KROHNE, and ERNST-DIETER JARASCH The Nuclear Envelope and the Architecture of the Nuclear Periphery The Journal of Cell Biology 91 39–50 1981 2112808 7033243 ] The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen. Nuclear pores, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast ) to 100 proteins (in vertebrate s ). The pores are 100  nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9  nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size allows the not-free passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acid s and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, [ 1996 Human Physiology Rodney Rhoades, Richard Pflanzer Saunders College Publishing Ch3 3rd ] each of which contains a donut-shaped, eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. [ Shulga N, Mosammaparast N, Wozniak R, Goldfarb D Yeast nucleoporins involved in passive nuclear envelope permeability J Cell Biol 149 5 1027–1038 2000 10831607 10.1083/jcb.149.5.1027 ] Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins. Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some DNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherin s. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. [ Pemberton L, Paschal B Mechanisms of receptor-mediated nuclear import and nuclear export Traffic 6 3 187–198 2005 15702987 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00270.x ] Steroid hormone s such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factor s when bound to their ligand; in the absence of ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylase s that repress gene expression. [ Nuclear lamina ] [ Nuclear lamina ] In animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores. The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported into the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. [ Stuurman N, Heins S, Aebi U Nuclear lamins: their structure, assembly, and interactions J Struct Biol 122 1–2 42–66 1998 9724605 10.1006/jsbi.1998.3987 ] [ Goldman A, Moir R, Montag-Lowy M, Stewart M, Goldman R Pathway of incorporation of microinjected lamin A into the nuclear envelope J Cell Biol 119 4 725–735 1992 1429833 10.1083/jcb.119.4.725 ] Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, [ Goldman R, Gruenbaum Y, Moir R, Shumaker D, Spann T Nuclear lamins: building blocks of nuclear architecture 10.1101/gad.960502 http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/16/5/533 Genes Dev 16 5 533–547 2002 11877373 ] that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. [ Moir RD, Yoona M, Khuona S, Goldman RD. Nuclear Lamins A and B1: Different Pathways of Assembly during Nuclear Envelope Formation in Living Cells Journal of Cell Biology 2000 151 6 1155–1168 11121432 10.1083/jcb.151.6.1155 ] Lamin structures that make up the veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes. [ Spann TP, Goldman AE, Wang C, Huang S, Goldman RD. Journal of Cell Biology Alteration of nuclear lamin organization inhibits RNA polymerase II–dependent transcription 2002 156 4 603–608 11854306 10.1083/jcb.200112047 ] Like the components of other intermediate filament s, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal. Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly are known as laminopathies. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood. [ Mounkes LC, Stewart CL Aging and nuclear organization: lamins and progeria Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2004 16 322–327 15145358 10.1016/j.ceb.2004.03.009 3 ] [ Chromosomes ] [ Chromosome ] { fibroblast nucleus in which } { DNA is stained blue. The distinct chromosome territories of chromosome 2 (red) and chromosome 9 (green) are stained with } { fluorescent in situ hybridization. } The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell&apos;s genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosome s. Each human cell contains 2m of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosome s familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell&apos;s genes are located instead in the mitochondria. There are two types of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. [ Ehrenhofer-Murray A Chromatin dynamics at DNA replication, transcription and repair Eur J Biochem 271 12 2335–2349 2004 15182349 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04162.x ] The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that are infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomere s and centromere s. [ Grigoryev S, Bulynko Y, Popova E The end adjusts the means: heterochromatin remodelling during terminal cell differentiation Chromosome Res 14 1 53–69 2006 16506096 10.1007/s10577-005-1021-6 ] During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, [ Schardin Margit Specific staining of human chromosomes in Chinese hamster x man hybrid cell lines demonstrates interphase chromosome territories Human Genetics 71 4 281–287 Springer Berlin / Heidelberg December 1985 http://www.springerlink.com/content/lv101t8w17306071/ 10.1007/BF00388452 2416668 Cremer T Hager HD Lang M ] called chromosome territories.

[ NF Rothfield, BD Stollar The Relation of Immunoglobulin Class, Pattern of Antinuclear Antibody, and Complement-Fixing Antibodies to DNA in Sera from Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus J Clin Invest 1967 46 11 1785–1794 4168731 10.1172/JCI105669 292929 ] These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. [ S Barned, AD Goodman, DH Mattson Frequency of anti-nuclear antibodies in multiple sclerosis Neurology 1995 45 2 384–385 7854544 ] As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious. [ Nucleolus ] [ Nucleolus ] { electron micrograph of a cell nucleus, showing the darkly stained } { nucleolus. } The nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures. [ Hernandez-Verdun Daniele Nucleolus: from structure to dynamics Histochem. Cell. Biol 1-2 127–137 2006 10.1007/s00418-005-0046-4 125 16328431 ] In the first step of ribosome assembly, a protein called RNA polymerase I transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA. [ Lamond Angus I. Judith E. Sleeman Nuclear substructure and dynamics current biology 13 21 R825–828 14588256 10.1016/j.cub.2003.10.012 ] The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) molecules, some of which are derived from spliced intron s from messenger RNA s encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores. When observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers (FCs), surrounded by the dense fibrillar component (DFC), which in turn is bordered by the granular component (GC). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.

These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckle s, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains. Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins. [ Goebel H.H. I Warlow January 1997 Nemaline myopathy with intranuclear rods—intranuclear rod myopathy Neuromuscular Disorders 7 1 13–19 10.1016/S0960-8966(96)00404-X 9132135 ] [ Cajal bodies and gems ] A nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2  µm and 2.0  µm depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. [ Matera AG, Frey MA. Coiled Bodies and Gems: Janus or Gemini? American Journal of Human Genetics 63 2 317–321 1998 9683623 10.1086/301992 ] CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification. Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of coiled bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close &quot; twin &quot; relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), but do contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, [ Matera A. Gregory Of Coiled Bodies, Gems, and Salmon Journal of Cellular Biochemistry 70 181–192 1998 9671224 ] though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure. [ RAFA and PTF domains ] RAFA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function was and remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. [ Saunders WS, Cooke CA, Earnshaw WC Compartmentalization within the nucleus: discovery of a novel subnuclear region.

They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. It has been suggested that they play a role in regulating transcription. [ Paraspeckles ] [ Paraspeckle ] Discovered by Fox et al. in 2002, paraspeckle s are irregularly shaped compartments in the nucleus&apos; interchromatin space.

Paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap. [ Splicing speckles ] Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery.

The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryote s. [ Cell compartmentalization ] The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, [ Lehninger Albert L. David L. Nelson, Michael M. Cox.

Biochem Soc Trans 33 1 265–268 15667322 10.1042/BST0330265 ] { PMID 15667322 } In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-κB -controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes. The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. [ Görlich Dirk Ulrike Kutay Transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 15 1 607–660 1999 10611974 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.15.1.607 ] Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in misformed and nonfunctional proteins. [ Gene expression ] [ Gene expression ] { gene transcription of } { ribosomal RNA illustrating the growing } { primary transcript s. &quot; Begin &quot; indicates the } { 5&apos; end of the DNA, where new RNA synthesis begins; &quot; end &quot; indicates the } { 3&apos; end, where the primary transcripts are almost complete. } Gene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported. [ Protein Synthesis and Ribosome Structure: Translating the Genome Nierhaus Knud H. Daniel N. Wilson 2004 Wiley-VCH 3-527-30638-2 ] Since the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicase s, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerase s, which synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerase s, which change the amount of supercoil ing in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factor s that regulate expression. [ Genome Structure and Function: From Chromosomes Characterization to Genes Technology Nicolini Claudio A. 1997 Springer 0-7923-4565-7 ] [ Processing of pre-mRNA ] [ Post-transcriptional modification ] Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcript s or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5&apos; cap ping, 3&apos; polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle s (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5&apos; cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3&apos; poly- adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete. RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exon s connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5&apos; capping and 3&apos; polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA. [ Dynamics and regulation ] [ Nuclear transport ] [ Nuclear transport ] { Macromolecule s, such as } { RNA and } { protein s, are } { actively transported across the nuclear membrane in a process called the } { Ran - } { GTP nuclear transport cycle. } The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, [ Watson JD Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann A, Levine M, Losick R. Molecular Biology of the Gene Peason Benjamin Cummings; CSHL Press. 2004 5th Ch9–10 0-8053-9603-9 ] macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherin s called importin s to enter the nucleus and exportin s to exit. &quot; Cargo &quot; proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signal s, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signal s bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPase s, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo. Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm. Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules&apos; central role in protein translation; mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation. [ Assembly and disassembly ] { newt } { lung cell } { stained with } { fluorescent } { dye s during } { metaphase. The } { mitotic spindle can be seen, stained green, attached to the two sets of } { chromosome s, stained light blue. All chromosomes but one are already at the metaphase plate. } During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death. During these events, the structural components of the nucleus  — the envelope and lamina  — can be systematically degraded.In most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them At a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatid s, attaching to microtubule s, which in turn are attached to different centrosome s. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope. [ Lippincott-Schwartz Jennifer Cell biology: Ripping up the nuclear envelope Nature 416 6876 31–32 2002-03-07 10.1038/416031a 11882878 ] Therefore the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. [ Boulikas T Phosphorylation of transcription factors and control of the cell cycle Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr 5 1 1–77 1995 7549180 ] Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins. However, in dinoflagellates, the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliate s, sporozoans ) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemle during cell division. Apoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell&apos;s structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic protease s called caspase s, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus&apos; structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assay s for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis. [ Steen R, Collas P Mistargeting of B-type lamins at the end of mitosis: implications on cell survival and regulation of lamins A/C expression J Cell Biol 153 3 621–626 2001 11331311 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621 ] The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane. [ Anucleated and multinucleated cells ] Human red blood cells, like those of other mammals, lack nuclei. This occurs as a normal part of the cells&apos; development. Although most cells have a single nucleus, some eukaryotic cell types have no nucleus, and others have many nuclei. This can be a normal process, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cell s, or a result of faulty cell division. Anucleated cells contain no nucleus and are, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria, and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body&apos;s tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte. [ Skutelsky E. Danon D. June 1970 Comparative study of nuclear expulsion from the late erythroblast and cytokinesis J Cell Biol 60(3) 625–635 5422968 10.1016/0014-4827(70)90536-7 ] The presence of mutagen s may induce the release of some immature &quot; micronucleated &quot; erythrocytes into the bloodstream. [ Torous DK Dertinger SD, Hall NE, Tometsko CR. 2000 Enumeration of micronucleated reticulocytes in rat peripheral blood: a flow cytometric study Mutat Res 465(1–2) 91–99 10.1016/S1383-5718(99)00216-8 10708974 ] [ Hutter KJ Stohr M. 1982 Rapid detection of mutagen induced micronucleated erythrocytes by flow cytometry Histochemistry 75 3 353–362 7141888 ] Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei. Multinucleated cells contain multiple nuclei. Most acantharea n species of protozoa [ Zettler LA Sogin ML, Caron DA 1997 Phylogenetic relationships between the Acantharea and the Polycystinea: A molecular perspective on Haeckel&apos;s Radiolaria Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94 21 11411–11416 9326623 10.1073/pnas.94.21.11411 23483 ] and some fungi in mycorrhizae [ Horton TR 2006 The number of nuclei in basidiospores of 63 species of ectomycorrhizal Homobasidiomycetes Mycologia 98 2 233–238 16894968 10.3852/mycologia.98.2.233 ] have naturally multinucleated cells. Other examples include the intestinal parasite s in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. [ Adam RD The biology of Giardia spp Microbiol. Rev. 55 4 706–32 1991 December 1779932 372844 http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view%3Dlong%26amp%3Bpmid%3D1779932 ] In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocyte s and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocyte s and macrophage s, known as giant multinucleated cell s, sometimes accompany inflammation [ McInnes A Rennick DM 1988 Interleukin 4 induces cultured monocytes/macrophages to form giant multinucleated cells J Exp Med 167 598–611 3258008 10.1084/jem.167.2.598 ] and are also implicated in tumor formation.

Four major theories have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support. [ Pennisi E. Evolutionary biology. The birth of the nucleus 10.1126/science.305.5685.766 Science 305 5685 766–768 2004 15297641 ] The theory known as the &quot; syntrophic model &quot; proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus. { C.Michael Hogan. 2010. &apos;&apos;Archaea&apos;&apos;. eds. E.Monosson &amp; C.Cleveland, Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC. } ) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplast s, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. [ Margulis, Lynn 1981 Symbiosis in Cell Evolution 206–227 W. H. Freeman and Company San Francisco 0-7167-1256-3 ] The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histone s. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinase s and G protein s similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell. [ Lopez-Garcia P, Moreira D. Selective forces for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus 10.1002/bies.20413 Bioessays 28 5 525–533 2006 16615090 ] A second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures. [ Fuerst JA. Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes Annu Rev Microbiol. 59 299–328 2005 15910279 10.1146/annurev.micro.59.030804.121258 ] A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the chronocyte, evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell. [ Hartman H, Fedorov A. The origin of the eukaryotic cell: a genomic investigation 10.1073/pnas.032658599 Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 99 3 1420–1425 2002 11805300 122206 ] The most controversial model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histone s to viral envelope s ). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular &quot; predator &quot;. [ Bell PJ Viral eukaryogenesis: was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? J. Mol. Evol. 53 3 251–6 2001 September 11523012 10.1007/s002390010215 ] Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxvirus es, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerase s in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. [ Takemura M 2001 Poxviruses and the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus J Mol Evol 52 5 419–425 11443345 10.1007/s002390010171 ] [ Villarreal L, DeFilippis V A hypothesis for DNA viruses as the origin of eukaryotic replication proteins 10.1128/JVI.74.15.7079-7084.2000 J Virol 74 15 7079–7084 2000 10888648 112226 ] It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis. [ Bell PJ Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus J. Theor. Biol. 243 1 54–63 2006 November 16846615 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.05.015 ] A very recent proposal suggests that traditional variants of the endosymbiont theory are insufficiently powerful to explain the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus. This model, termed the exomembrane hypothesis, suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.
