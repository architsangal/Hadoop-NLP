Wellington College is a British co-educational public school located in the village of Crowthorne in Berkshire. It was built as a national monument to the Duke of Wellington, after whom the school was named. Wellington is a registered charity (#309093) and currently has just under 1000 pupils aged between 13 and 18. [ http://www.wellingtoncollege.org.uk/history Wellington&apos;s History 16 March 2011 Wellington College website ] The school is a member of the Rugby Group, which also includes Harrow School and Charterhouse School and is also a member of the G20 Schools group. The Good Schools Guide called the school &quot; a serious player in the field of education. &quot; { http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/school/wellington-college-2.html } [ History ] Wellington College was granted its royal charter in 1853 as the Royal and Religious Foundation of The Wellington College, and was opened in 1859. Its first master { The headmaster is known as &quot; the Master &quot; } was Edward White Benson, later Archbishop of Canterbury. The college&apos;s Visitor is HM The Queen. [ http://www.wellingtoncollege.org.uk/news/general-news/visit-by-her-majesty-the-queen- Visit by Her Majesty the Queen 10 August 2010 Wellington College website ] Originally, the school supported children of deceased officers who had held commissions in the Army and in the Army of the East India Company. In 1952 a Supplementary Royal Charter extended the privilege of eligibility to the orphan children of deceased officers of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force. A recent change early in 2006 extended the privilege to the orphan children of deceased servicemen or servicewomen of Her Majesty&apos;s Armed Forces irrespective of rank, and to the orphan children of persons who, in the sole opinion of Governors, died in acts of selfless bravery. However, only a minority of the children at the school come from military families. By this time, the school was considering a possibility of moving into coeducation but the lack of financial resources prevent it from doing so. The first girls were admitted into the Sixth Form during the 1970&apos;s and became fully coeducational in 2005. [ The Wellington Academy ] Wellington has sponsored the founding of a new independent state school in Wiltshire, The Wellington Academy, { http://www.thewellingtonacademy.org.uk } which opened in 2009. [ Wellington College International ] Wellington is in partnership with Wellington College International Tianjin, modelled on the buildings and ethos of the college, and which is due to open in August 2011. [ Architecture ] The college was designed by John Shaw Jr, who had also previously worked as an architect for Eton College. It is located in Crowthorne, a large village in the Royal County of Berkshire in south-east England. For its time, the design of the college was unusual compared to the popular form, but Prince Albert who helped choose the architect was more interested in Shaw&apos;s classical approach, having already seen the architect&apos;s design for the old Royal Naval School in New Cross, London. [ John Shaw, Junior (1803-70): A Brief Biographical Introduction http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/shaw/bio2.html Paul Johnson Victorian Web 2008-04-23 ] The main buildings were designed in a style loosely termed &quot; French Grand Rococo &quot;, [ History Wellington College http://www.wellingtoncollege.org.uk/page.aspx?id%3D6 2008-09-07 ] and the chapel was designed by George Gilbert Scott. [ September 2008 ] There have been many modern buildings, the best of which appropriately follow Shaw&apos;s style while still being exciting modern architecture: for example, the new Nicholson modern foreign languages building. [ Location ] Wellington College is located in a 400 acre (1.6  km²) estate in South East England, in the Royal County of Berkshire, approximately 30 miles (50  km) from Heathrow Airport and close to the town of Reading, Berkshire. The grounds of the college are beautiful and extensive, large enough to hold a top-class golf course and considerable woodland in addition to playing fields which are much more extensive than most comparable institutions. They are also notable in that they contain many unusual ant and spider species, and were frequented by the entomologist Horace Donisthorpe, who collected extensively there. [ September 2008 ] The grounds also contain an area of SSSI. [ Recent developments ] In addition to introducing girls throughout, the school is in the forefront of educational thinking, firstly through the many conferences it organises, and also by adopting the IB Diploma Programme alongside A level. Lower down the school, the Middle Years Programme – also from IBO – is being introduced as an alternative to GCSE. The school is becoming increasingly popular and despite increasing rapidly in size, competition for places is fierce. The school has pulled itself well into the first division, as defined by leading newspapers.

[ September 2008 ] In April 2006, the college attracted widespread publicity when it became the first school in the UK to introduce &apos;happiness lessons&apos; to the curriculum, [ True happiness is a lesson well taught http://www.tes.co.uk/2224724 Times Educational Supplement 2006-05-08 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] in conjunction with a team at Cambridge University.

She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot; They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed. &quot; [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1455730/Private-schools-send-papers-to-fee-fixing-inquiry.html Private schools send papers to fee-fixing inquiry The Daily Telegraph London 1 March 2004 15 March 2011 ] [ Houses ] There are 17 houses at Wellington.
