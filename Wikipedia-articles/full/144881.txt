{ Mickey Spillane, Ed Robbins and Joe Gill&apos;s &apos;&apos;From the Files of... Mike Hammer&apos;&apos; (January 31, 1954). } Michael &quot; Mike &quot; Hammer is a fictional character created by the American author Mickey Spillane in the 1947 book I, the Jury (made into a movie in 1953 and 1982). [ Description ] Several movies and radio and television series have been based on the books in the Hammer series. The actor most closely identified with the character in recent years has been Stacy Keach, who portrayed Hammer in a CBS television series, Mickey Spillane&apos;s Mike Hammer, which ran from 1984 –1987 and had a syndicated revival in 1997 –1998. (An earlier syndicated version, originally aired in 1957 –1958, starred Darren McGavin as Hammer.) Spillane himself played Hammer in a 1963 motion picture adaptation of The Girl Hunters. Spillane himself favoured ex- Marine and former Newburgh, New York police officer Jack Stang, on whom he based the character, to play him. Stang appeared with Spillane in the 1954 film Ring of Fear and in the film adaptation of I, the Jury. [ Creation ] Prior to World War II, Mickey Spillane was a writer of many well known comic books. After World War II he used what would be the plot of I, the Jury for a comic book character called Mike Danger. When converting the comic book to a novel originally in hardcover, Spillane wrote the work in nine days in some accounts, nineteen in other accounts. { p.142 Gale, Robert L. A Mickey Spillane Companion Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 } [ Character ] While pulp detectives such as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe are hard-boiled and cynical, Hammer is in many ways the archetypal &quot; hard man &quot; : brutally violent, and fuelled by a genuine rage against violent crime that never afflicts Raymond Chandler &apos;s or Dashiell Hammett &apos;s heroes. In The Big Kill Hammer describes himself to a bargirl as a misanthrope. While other hardboiled heroes bend and manipulate the law, Hammer often views it as an impediment to justice, the one virtue he holds in absolute esteem. Hammer nevertheless has a strong respect for the majority of police, realizing they have a difficult job and their hands are frequently tied by the law when trying to stop criminals. Mike Hammer is a no-holds barred private investigator who carries a.45 Colt M1911 in a shoulder harness under his left arm. His love for his secretary Velda is only outweighed by his willingness to kill a killer. Hammer&apos;s best friend is Pat Chambers, Captain of Homicide NYPD. Hammer was a veteran of the Battle of Guadalcanal, possibly a former US Marine. { Spillane, Mickey I, the Jury } { p. 253 Gibson, James William Self-Transformation in Combat and the Pleasures in Killing in Dizard, Jan E.; Muth, Robert M. &amp; Andrews, Stephen P. editors Guns in America: A Reader NYU Press, 1999 } Hammer is also patriotic and anti-communist. The novels are peppered with remarks by Hammer supporting American troops in Korea, and in Survival...Zero Vietnam. In One Lonely Night, where Hammer attends a communist meeting in a park, his reaction to the speaker&apos;s propaganda is a sarcastic &quot; Yeah. &quot; So far as violence is concerned, the Hammer novels leave little to the imagination. Written in the first person, Hammer describes his violent encounters with relish. In all but a few novels, Hammer&apos;s victims are often left vomiting after a blow to the stomach or groin. The Washington Times obituary of Spillane said of Hammer, &quot; In a manner similar to Clint Eastwood &apos;s Dirty Harry, Hammer was a cynical loner contemptuous of the &apos;tedious process&apos; of the legal system, choosing instead to enforce the law on his own terms. &quot; { Washington Times - Mystery novelist Spillane dies } [ Novels ] I, The Jury (1947) My Gun is Quick (1950) Vengeance Is Mine!
