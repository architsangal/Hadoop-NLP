{ John Singer Sargent } Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García (17 March 1805 – 1 July 1906), was a Spanish singer, music educator, and vocal pedagogue. [ Biography ] García was born on 17 March 1805 either in Madrid, as has been traditionally stated, or in the town of Zafra in Badajoz Province, Spain. { Nearly all sources (e.g. Fitzlyon; &apos;&apos;Encyclopædia Britannica Online&apos;&apos;; H. Rosenthal and J. Warrack, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, London, Oxford University Press, 1964, ad nomen; Teresa Radomski, &apos;&apos;Manuel García (1805/1906): A Bicentenary Reflection&apos;&apos;, &quot; Australian Voice &quot;, Volume 11, 2005, p. 26) report Madrid as Garcia’s (likely) birthplace, but his pupil and biographer Malcolm Sterling Mackinlay wrote that “the place of his birth was not Madrid, as has been so often stated, but Zafra in Catalonia” (Garcia the centenarian, p. 13). In fact, however, the town of } { Zafra is in } { Extremadura, not in } { Catalonia. } His father was singer and teacher Manuel del Pópulo Vicente Rodriguez García (Manuel García I, 1775–1832). His sisters were Maria Malibran (1808–1836) and Pauline Viardot (1821–1910), who was also his pupil. After abandoning his onstage career as a baritone, García began to teach at the Paris Conservatory (1830–48) and the Royal Academy of Music, London (1848–95). Jessie Bond, Camille Everardi, Erminia Frezzolini, Jenny Lind, Mathilde Marchesi, Christina Nilsson, Julia Ettie Crane, Julius Stockhausen, Marie Tempest, and Henry Wood were among his pupils. He invented a laryngoscope in 1854 and the next year published observations of his own larynx and vocal cords made with a small dental mirror introduced into the throat and using sunlight reflected by another mirror.

The Laryngoscope. Volume 15, pp. 402-403 } García was interested in movements connected with the production of the singing voice and did not anticipate the importance of laryngoscopy for medicine. Still, the University of Königsberg conferred upon him the honorary degree of M.D. { Mackinlay, p. 219 } He died in London in 1906 at the age of 101 years and was buried in the churchyard of St. Edward&apos;s Catholic church in Sutton Green, Surrey. His grave gives details of his many famous pupils and accomplishments. On 22 November 1832 in Paris García married the operatic soprano Cécile Eugénie Mayer ( Paris, 8 April 1814 – Paris, 12 August 1880). They had two sons and two daughters. { Sidney Lee (1912). Dictionary of National Biography, Second Supplement, Vol. II (Faed-Muybridge), Reprint: Elibron Classics 2005. ISBN 1-4021-7063-7 } Their son Gustave Garcia (1837–1925) was a singer, actor, and author of three books on vocal and stage techniques. Gustave&apos;s son, Alberto García (1875–1946), studied voice with his great aunt ( Pauline Viardot ), became a respected baritone, and produced an edition of his grandfather&apos;s treatise on singing (1924).
