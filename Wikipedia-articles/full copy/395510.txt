With the formation of the 49th New Zealand Parliament after the 2008 election, it has a single member of the Parliament of New Zealand – party leader Peter Dunne, an electorate MP – and it has signed a confidence and supply agreement with the National Party, making it, along with ACT and the Maori Party, a support partner to the minority National government.

United, formed as a centrist party by a group of moderate Labour and National MPs, held one seat in parliament. Future New Zealand, which was not represented in parliament, was a &quot; secularised &quot; evolution of the } { Christian Democrats, following the same basic principles as the Christian Democrats, but abandoning the explicit religious connection. } [ July 2011 ] United Future&apos;s first party president, Inky Tulloch, stated that &quot; United Future isn&apos;t a Christian party – it&apos;s a political party that has a lot of Christians in it, and a lot of non-Christians. &quot; [ July 2011 ] Tulloch said that the &quot; universal principles of family, of common sense, of looking after one another, of compassion, integrity &quot; are equally valuable to both Christians and non-Christians. [ July 2011 ] Support for United Future, which was already growing in early 2002, was boosted further by Peter Dunne&apos;s strong television debating performance and the public response to it. The uplift in United Future support during the last two weeks of the campaign caught many commentators by surprise and drew votes away from National, Labour and the Green parties, who were engaged in a public squabble over genetic engineering. [ Early activity ] After 2002 United Future in its family law reform proposals took to heart the trauma and adverse impact on children caused by the separation of their parents. United Future MP Judy Turner made clear that then current government policies were failing in regard to keeping both parents in children&apos;s lives, and to this extent made a huge effort in promoting a Member’s Bill on mandatory mediation by means of a national roll-out of the North Shore Family Court &quot; Children in the Middle &quot; pilot programme. United Future MPs exercised their individual conscience votes to oppose a Bill to enable civil unions. This provided an alternative to marriage for same-sex couples and to opposite-sex couples who choose not to marry. A civil union provides a couple with most of the same rights as married couples. However, Peter Dunne and Judy Turner both supported a companion Bill to give legal recognition to civil unions. In mid-2004 United Future announced that it would contest the 2005 general election in partnership with Outdoor Recreation New Zealand. Cynics pointed out that here was another minor party that failed to reach the 5% threshold (Outdoor Recreation gained 1.28% of the vote in the 2002 election) seeking parliamentary representation via the security of Peter Dunne&apos;s electorate seat. A month before the 2005 election, list MP Paul Adams quit the party to stand as an independent in the East Coast Bays electorate. His daughter Sharee Adams, also on the United Future List, also quit to assist her father in his campaign. After the general election, disgruntled right-winger and ex-United Future MP Marc Alexander also voiced repeated criticisms of his former colleagues, in his &quot; Marc My Words &quot; political opinion column for Scoop, a New Zealand news website. In the 2005 election, United Future had the support of the WIN Party, which was set up to fight the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants. Win&apos;s leader, John van Buren, was United Future&apos;s candidate for Christchurch Central. This further spoke of alliances still to come. In this election, support plummeted to 2.8% and the party won only three seats. Peter Dunne retained Ohariu-Belmont, and Gordon Copeland and Judy Turner were returned on its party list. United Future had tried to distance itself from its more assertive fundamentalist list MPs, such as Adams, Larry Baldock and Murray Smith. [ July 2011 ] As Election New Zealand data revealed that the Outdoor Recreation Party still provided about 1% of the vote, 4.8% of the previous vote had gone elsewhere. During 2004-2005, the National Party had made renewed efforts to attract social conservative voters, through adoption of pro-life and anti- same-sex marriage voting records. [ July 2011 ] Following the 2005 election, New Zealand First and United Future entered into a confidence and supply agreement with Labour, under which Dunne became Minister of Revenue, outside Cabinet. In March 2006 Outdoor Recreation New Zealand split with United Future, due to a dissatisfaction with what it saw as the Christian evangelism within the party. Outdoor Recreation acting chairman Phil Hoare said, &quot; We strongly believe in the traditional bedrock values of our nation&apos;s heritage but we also affirm the separation of church and state. &quot; [ http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id%3D1%26amp%3BObjectID%3D10374646 Outdoor Recreation splits from United Future 27 March 2006 The New Zealand Herald 12 September 2011 ] In 2006 several younger centrist members also departed from the party. United Future, like most New Zealand Parliamentary parties, was caught up in the 2005 New Zealand election funding controversy. It voted in favour of the retrospective validating legislation, which was passed through the New Zealand Parliament in October 2006. Old United Future logo From February to April 2007, Peter Dunne exercised his own right to a conscience vote to support Sue Bradford &apos;s private members bill against parental corporal punishment of children, while Gordon Copeland vigorously opposed it, as did Judy Turner, but on a more subtle level. { Section 59 Crimes Act Repeal } On 16 May 2007, Copeland resigned from the party due to his dissatisfaction with Dunne&apos;s support for the aforementioned private members bill, although Turner did not follow suit.

Some other United Future New Zealand members resigned in sympathy with Copeland. On 13 August 2007 the party unveiled a new logo which Dunne said was a revitalisation of the party before the 2008 election. { UnitedFuture unveils new logo } The re-branding of the party was taken further on 3 September 2007 when Peter Dunne announced that United Future was rebranding itself as a sensible, moderate centre party after the break with its Christian faction. Speaking of the departure of the Christian faction Dunne stated &quot; I think it&apos;s taken a bit of a monkey off our back, frankly. &quot; [ http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id%3D280%26amp%3Bobjectid%3D10461328 Dunne rebrands United Future after Christian faction split 3 September 2007 The New Zealand Herald 12 September 2011 ] [ Policy ] United Future adopted the following mission statement in early 2007: &quot; United Future is a modern centre party, focused on New Zealand&apos;s best interests. We promote strong families and vibrant communities. We seek a fair, and open society, free from poverty, ignorance and prejudice, and based on innovation, self-reliance, justice and integrity in business and personal dealings. We promote a sustainable environment, and a competitive economy which encourages growth, prosperity, ownership and opportunity through market policies where possible, and government where necessary. We want all New Zealanders, whatever their background, race or creed, to have the chance to enjoy everything that is good in our country. &quot; [ http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0708/S00207.htm UnitedFuture unveils new logo 13 August 2007 2007-10-31 Scoop.co.nz ] In 2007 the party had a number of policy successes, including: [ November 2008 ] Bringing about the first cut in the business tax rate in 20 years; Making all personal and corporate donations to charity tax deductible; Extending summer daylight saving hours by three weeks; Introducing legislation to increase the minimum driving age to 16 years; Leading the campaign for a code of conduct for MPs; Playing a leading role in getting the government to back down on planned new rules for financing elections, and proposed restrictions on births, deaths and marriages data for historical; and genealogical research purposes; Establishing a special government task force to look at using deer, chamois and tahr as a recreational hunting resource. [ 2008 election ] In 2008 the United Future Party named candidates for 51 seats. { Dominion Post. 15 April 2008 page A2 } Policies included tax cuts and various initiatives aimed at supporting parents, such as the extension of paid parental leave to 12 months; the option of income splitting for parents with dependent children and couples in which one partner relies on the other for financial support; and the promotion of shared parenting. There were also a number of healthcare policies including granting everyone one free health check per year. The election resulted in Peter Dunne&apos;s re-election as United Future&apos;s only surviving Member of Parliament. He retained his own parliamentary seat of Ohariu-Belmont, but United Future itself did not poll sufficiently highly to bring additional caucus members into Parliament alongside him. It is unknown how many former Future New Zealand members defected from United Future to establish The Kiwi Party, which was unsuccessful in retaining parliamentary representation after the election. The National Party won the most seats overall and formed a minority government with support from United Future as well as the Maori Party and ACT New Zealand. Dunne retained his portfolios as Minister of Revenue and Associate Minister for Health.

The Labour candidate Charles Chauvel accused Dunne and the National Party of an &quot; unprincipled political deal &quot; which encouraged National voters to give their electorate vote to Dunne to ensure his survival as an MP.

Together with his previous Revenue and Associate Health portfolios, Dunne became Associate Minister of Conservation. The agreement also included provisions barring the sale of Kiwibank or Radio New Zealand, and public consultation on United Future&apos;s flexible superannuation policy.
