To accommodate Grand Prix motor racing, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps race course was built in 1921 but it was only used for motorcycle racing until 1924. After the 1923 success of the new 24 hours of Le Mans in France, the Spa 24 Hours, a similar 24 hour endurance race, was run at the Spa track. Since inception, Spa-Francorchamps has been known for its unpredictable weather. At one stage in its history it had rained at the Belgian Grand Prix for twenty years in a row. Frequently drivers confront a part of the course that is clear and bright while another stretch is rainy and slippery. The Belgian Grand Prix was designated the European Grand Prix six times between 1925 and 1973, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one grand prix race in Europe. [ History ] [ Original Spa circuit ] In 1925, the first Belgian Grand Prix was held at the 9-mile Spa-Francorchamps circuit, and it was won by Antonio Ascari whose son Alberto would win the race in 1952 and 1953. Unfortunately, after winning the Belgian race, Antonio Ascari would be killed in his next outing at the French Grand Prix. In 1939, the race claimed the life of British driver Richard &quot; Dick &quot; Seaman while leading the race. After not being held for 8 years because of World War II, the Belgian Grand Prix was held in 1947, and the circuit had been modified to make it even faster, shortening it to 8.7 miles (14.1 km). And as time progressed through the 1950&apos;s and 1960&apos;s, Spa was often known as the fastest circuit in Europe (with the possible exception of Monza). But as the years passed by Formula One cars were becoming faster and faster, and the circuit became more and more dangerous. During the 1960 race Chris Bristow and Alan Stacey lost their lives in separate incidents, the latter in a freak occurrence when hit in the face by a bird. Things came to a head when the Belgian Grand Prix was scheduled for 8 June 1969 as part of the 1969 Formula One season at Spa, but when Jackie Stewart visited the circuit on behalf of the Grand Prix Drivers&apos; Association he demanded many improvements to safety barriers and road surfaces, in order to make the track safe for racing. { &quot; Need for safer circuit &quot;, The Times, 25 March 1969, p. 14. } When the track owners did not want to pay for the safety improvements, British and Italian Formula 1 teams withdrew from the event, and it was cancelled in early April. { &quot; Belgian GP succumbs to ban &quot;, The Times, 12 April 1969, p. 11. } One last race was held there in 1970 with barriers and a temporary chicane at the fast Malmedy corner installed at the circuit- but even this did not stop the cars averaging over [ 150 mi/h km/h ] around the [ 8.7 mi ] track. This was not good enough for Formula One, as proven in 1971, the track was not up to mandatory safety spec and the Belgian Grand Prix was cancelled that year. The event was then eventually relocated. [ Relocation ] Following that decision, the Belgians decided to alternate their Grand Prix between Zolder and a circuit at Nivelles-Baulers near Brussels. The first race at Nivelles in 1972 was won by Emerson Fittipaldi. Zolder hosted the race the following year and it was won by Jackie Stewart. Formula One returned to Nivelles in 1974. Once again the race was won by Fittipaldi, but the circuit was unpopular among the Formula One circus and after that event the organizers were unable to sustain a Grand Prix at Nivelles, and the track faded from the racing scene. The Belgian Grand Prix would be held at Zolder a further nine times. Niki Lauda scored back-to-back victories at the track in 1975 and 1976, and in 1977 Gunnar Nilsson scored his only F1 victory at Zolder. The following year Mario Andretti won the race for Lotus. In 1979, Jody Scheckter won the race in his Ferrari. In 1980 Didier Pironi became a first time winner at the track in his Ligier. The 1981 meeting that was won by Carlos Reutemann was chaotic with a mechanic being killed in the pitlane, a drivers&apos; strike and then a startline accident involving an Arrows mechanic. Zolder will be remembered, however, as the place where Gilles Villeneuve died in 1982. John Watson won the race for McLaren, but a year later the rebuilt Spa circuit opened for racing and the Belgian Grand Prix returned there. The Belgian Grand Prix returned to Zolder in 1984, and this was the last F1 race held at the Flemish circuit with Michele Alboreto taking the final victory there. In 1985 the Belgian F1 Grand Prix returned to Spa-Francorchamps where it has remained ever since. [ Modern Spa ] World Champion Michael Schumacher, who made his debut at Spa in 1991 and won his first F1 race there in 1992, won his 52nd Grand Prix at Spa in 2001, surpassing Alain Prost &apos;s all-time record of 51 wins. Schumacher also won his seventh World Drivers&apos; Championship title at Spa in 2004. There was no Belgian Grand Prix in 2003 because of the country&apos;s tobacco advertising laws, but it returned to the schedule again in 2004. The 1998 Belgian Grand Prix took place in torrential conditions. The race was originally stopped after an accident involving thirteen of the twenty-two runners at the first corner. The heavy rain caused low visibility, and Michael Schumacher ran into the back of David Coulthard, an event that angered Schumacher so much he stormed into the McLaren garage to confront Coulthard, claiming he had tried to kill him. Coulthard later admitted he had been at fault, due to his own inexperience. { http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/06/1057430084085.html } Only eight drivers were classified finishers (two of whom were five laps behind, one of whom was Coulthard) and Damon Hill secured a victory ahead of team mate Ralf Schumacher to record the previously underperforming Jordan team&apos;s first Formula One win in its history, and a 1-2 to top it off. In 2006, the FIA announced the Belgian Grand Prix would not be part of the 2006 Formula One season, since the local authorities had started major repair work in Spa-Francorchamps. The Belgian Grand Prix returned in 2007, when Kimi Räikkönen took pole position and his 3rd Belgian Grand Prix win in a row. In 2008, McLaren&apos;s Lewis Hamilton survived a frantic last two laps in a late shower of rain to win the Belgian Grand Prix. Hamilton lost the lead to Ferrari&apos;s Kimi Räikkönen with an early spin but fought back in the closing laps to re-take the lead with two laps to go. On a soaking track, Hamilton passed Räikkönen, lost the lead again with a spin, re-took it and then saw Räikkönen crash. Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa took second leaving him eight points behind Hamilton. However, the stewards decided after the race to apply a drive-through penalty for Hamilton&apos;s pass on Räikkönen (i.e. a 25-second penalty). This left Hamilton in third place behind Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa and BMW Sauber&apos;s Nick Heidfeld. The penalty cut Hamilton&apos;s lead over Massa to just two points with five races remaining. McLaren appealed the decision but were turned down as it is not permissible to appeal drive-through penalties. The stewards&apos; decision was criticised by former world champion Niki Lauda calling it &quot; completely wrong &quot;. { BBC Sport, 8th September 2008 } In 2009, Bernie Ecclestone said in an interview that he would like the Belgian Grand Prix to rotate with a Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, rather than the Nürburgring rotating with the Hockenheimring. { http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/auto_motor/F1/090804_ecclestone_gp_belgie } Michael Schumacher has won the Belgian Grand Prix 6 times and Ayrton Senna won 5 times; including 4 times in a row from 1988-1991, and Kimi Räikkönen and Jim Clark both won 4 times (Clark also won 4 times in row, from 1962-1965).
