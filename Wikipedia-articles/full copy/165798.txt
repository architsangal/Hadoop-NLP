[ Gameplay ] { Octorok monsters with his sword in the overworld } The Legend of Zelda incorporates elements of action, adventure, role-playing, and puzzle games. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels in the overworld, a large outdoor map with varied environments.

[ The Legend of Zelda Instruction Booklet Nintendo of America, Inc. 8 June 2010 41 ] Throughout the game, merchants, fairies, townspeople, and others guide Link with cryptic clues.

Once he has completed the artifact, he can enter the ninth dungeon to rescue Zelda. Apart from this exception, the order of completing dungeons is somewhat left to the player, although they steadily increase in difficulty and some of them can only be reached or completed using items gained in a previous one. Link can freely wander the overworld, finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game. For example, it is possible to reach the final boss of the game without ever receiving the sword.

A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon&apos;s henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her. After hearing Impa&apos;s plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon. During the course of the game, Link locates the eight underground labyrinths, defeats several guardian monsters, and retrieves the fragments. With the completed Triforce of Wisdom, Link is able to infiltrate Ganon&apos;s hideout, Death Mountain, eventually confronting the pig-like enemy and destroying him with a Silver Arrow.

[ Club Nintendo Classic: Zelda und Link German April 1996 72 Nintendo of Europe GmbH ] The development team worked on The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. concurrently, and tried to separate their ideas: Super Mario Bros. was to be linear, where the action occurred in a strict sequence, whereas The Legend of Zelda would be the opposite. In Mario, Miyamoto downplayed the importance of the high score in favor of simply completing the game.

Miyamoto was also in charge of deciding which concepts were &quot; Zelda ideas &quot; or &quot; Mario ideas. &quot; Contrasting with Mario, Zelda was made non-linear and forced the players to think about what they should do next with riddles and puzzles.

According to Miyamoto, those in Japan were confused and had trouble finding their way through the multiple path dungeons. Rather than listening to the complaints, Miyamoto took away the sword, forcing players to communicate with each other and share their ideas to solve puzzles. This was a new form of game communication, and in this way, &quot; Zelda became the inspiration for something very different: Animal Crossing. This was a game based solely on communication. &quot; [ Fahey Michael 2007-03-08 GDC07: Liveblogging Nintendo Kotaku http://kotaku.com/#%21242670%2Fgdc07-liveblogging-nintendo ] With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto wanted to take the idea of a game &quot; world &quot; even further, giving players a &quot; miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer. &quot; He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless wonder he felt. &quot; When I was a child, &quot; he said, &quot; I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it.

She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked the sound of her name. So I took the liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title, &quot; Miyamoto explained.

The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros. and Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the Disk Card media&apos;s advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, the Japanese version of the game was only in katakana. It used rewritable disks to save the game, rather than passwords. The Japanese version used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link&apos;s sword when his health is full, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the NES&apos;s PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom&apos;s controller that was not included in the NES.

However, they cannot be killed through use of the flute, and on the NES must be killed with weapons. The cartridge version made use of the Memory Management Controller chip, specifically the MMC1 model. The MMC could use bank-switching, allowing larger games than had been previously possible. They also allowed for battery-powered RAM, which let players save progress for the first time on any system or game. [ January 1991 Why Your Game Paks Never Forget Nintendo Power Nintendo 20 28–31 ] [ Release ] The gold-colored cartridge Contrary to the fears of Nintendo&apos;s management, the game was popular and well-received. A year later, Nintendo released the sequel, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, for the Disk System. This was not released in North America until almost two years later. The Legend of Zelda had been available a year and a half and Zelda II for six months before Nintendo brought the game to North America. When Nintendo published the game in North America, the packaging design featured a small portion of the box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, The Legend of Zelda sold two million copies. { Sheff (1993), p. 172 } Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a warranty card became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got longer. { Sheff (1987), p. 178 } From the success of magazines in Japan, Nintendo knew that game tips were a valued asset. Players enjoyed the bimonthly newsletter&apos;s crossword puzzles and jokes, but game secrets were most valued. The Fun Club drew kids in by offering tips for the more complicated games, especially Zelda, with its hidden rooms, secret keys and passageways. The mailing list grew. By early 1988, there were over 1 million Fun Club members, which led then-Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa to start the Nintendo Power magazine. { Sheff (1993), p. 178 } Since Nintendo did not have many products, it made only a few commercial s a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal. The budget for a single commercial could reach US $5 million, easily four or five times more than most companies spent. { Sheff (1993), p. 188 } One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for The Legend of Zelda, which received a great deal of attention in the ad industry. In it, a wiry-haired, nerdy guy ( John Kassir ) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of some enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda. Nintendo released a great deal of merchandise related to The Legend of Zelda, including toys, guidebooks, watches, apparel, trash cans and a breakfast cereal called Nintendo Cereal System. The game and its sequel, The Adventure of Link were adapted into an animated series, episodes of which were shown on television each Friday on The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!. Link and Zelda appeared in several episodes of Captain N: The Game Master that revolved around themes from The Adventure of Link.
