The party states that it is the rightful continuation and successor to the tradition of the Socialist Party of America, which had lasted from 1901 to 1972. The party is officially committed to left-wing democratic socialism. The Socialist Party USA, along with its predecessors, has received varying degrees of support, when its candidates have competed against those from the Republican and Democratic parties. Some attribute this to the party having to compete with the financial dominance of the two major parties, as well as the limitations of the United States&apos; legislatively { Winger, Richard. &quot; Institutional Obstacles to a Multiparty System, &quot; in Multiparty Politics in America, Paul S.

The Party supports third-party candidates, particularly socialists, and opposes the candidates of the two major parties. Opposing both capitalism and &quot; authoritarian communism &quot;, the Party advocates bringing big business under public ownership and democratic workers&apos; self-management. It does not advocate the unaccountable bureaucratic control of Soviet communism.

The New York Times observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored Darlington Hoopes as its candidate for President in the 1956 election, who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only six states.
