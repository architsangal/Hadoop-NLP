[ March 2011 ] [ MetaFilter 250px Community Weblog Required to contribute MetaFilter Network LLC Matthew Haughey 1999 Active ] MetaFilter, known as MeFi to its members, [ http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13682/Announcing-the-new-weekly-MeFi-podcast 1: The First One &amp; #124; MetaTalk Metatalk.metafilter.com 2009-03-25 ] [ http://metatalk.metafilter.com/11398/ Pronunciation of MeFi and MeFite? &amp; #124; MetaTalk Metatalk.metafilter.com 2009-03-25 ] [ http://metatalk.metafilter.com/14804/MeFil MeFil &amp; #124; MetaTalk Metatalk.metafilter.com 2009-03-25 ] is a general-interest community weblog, founded in 1999 and based in the United States, featuring links to content that users have discovered on the web. Since 2003, it has included the popular question-and-answer subsite Ask MetaFilter. The site has six paid staff members, including the owner, and, as of early 2011, about 12,000 active members. [ Community ] MetaFilter was founded by Matthew Haughey in 1999. Haughey wrote the software for the site himself, using Macromedia ColdFusion and Microsoft SQL Server. [ http://www.noor.bz/pdf/ali-hasan_metafilter.pdf MetaFilter: An Analysis of a Community Weblog Noor Ali-Hasan University of Michigan School of Information 2007-03-06 ] From its early beginnings as a small community of webloggers who traded links, the weblog now enjoys international popularity. Members are permitted to make one post to the front page per day, which must feature at least one link. { http://faq.metafilter.com/#48 } Members may then comment on these posts. Although membership was initially free and unrestricted, growing membership forced frequent extended closures of new-member signup. On November 18, 2004, Haughey reopened signups, but with a 5 USD life-time membership fee. { David Carr, &quot; Soothe the Blog and Reap the Whirlwind &quot;, New York Times, January 23, 2006 } According to TIME magazine, this fee keeps the site &quot; remarkably free of trolls, griefer s and other anonymous jerks &quot;, resulting in a &quot; public-spirited flavor of a small town or good university &quot;. [ http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0%2C28804%2C1918031_1918016_1917970%2C00.html 50 Best Websites 2009: MetaFilter TIME magazine 2009-08-24 2009-08-24 ] Although the number of registrations has topped 100,000, a design flaw in the counting process means that it counts users who abandoned the signup process mid way; the actual number of posters is smaller, clocking in at around 38,700 as of October 2008. [ http://metatalk.metafilter.com/15658/Metafilter-Infodump-more-stats-than-you-can-shake-a-stick-at Metafilter Infodump: more stats than you can shake a stick at. cortex ] MetaFilter has developed a fairly stable community with a variety of in-joke s. Members regularly gather for meetups in cities around the world, and there are numerous websites with strong connections to MetaFilter members and subgroups, including MetaChat and MonkeyFilter, the latter getting its start during the period when MetaFilter memberships were closed. Readers can mark other users’ comments as a favorite, and commenters derive pride from how many times they have been &quot; favorited. &quot; { Allen Salkin, &quot; All-Stars of the Clever Riposte &quot;, New York Times, September 30, 2007 } MetaFilter was included in TIME magazine &apos;s 50 Best Websites 2009 feature. At SXSW 2011, Haughey gave a talk in which he noted that MetaFilter had about 125,000 user accounts, of which 12,000 are active. [ http://vimeo.com/21043675 Lessons from 11 years of community (my SXSW 2011 talk) on Vimeo 2011-03-15 Haughey Matt 2011-03-14 Vimeo ] [ Content ] MetaFilter&apos;s name derives from the idea that weblogs &quot; filter &quot; the &quot; best of the web &quot;, and MetaFilter posts ( guidelines ) would be the best of the best. [ http://www.metafilter.com/guidelines.mefi Guidelines MetaFilter 2009-09-23 ] Posters are presumed responsible for selecting only the most interesting or novel websites to link, and users&apos; reputations are largely determined by overall posting quality. Half-baked posts, self-promotion, open-ended questions, and other fare common on other community sites and internet forum s are strongly discouraged at MetaFilter, though such things do sometimes make it through [ September 2008 ]. Posts must contain a link, and the site linked must be of high quality. [ Best of the Web ] What gets posted is diverse. Online art, award-winning web design, photography galleries, and the like fit into a cool site of the day theme that is highly prized but often generates scant discussion. Flash games and funny online movies also appear. Net and blog culture discussions also percolate through MetaFilter, reflecting its early connections with Blogger, but this is becoming less common as membership expands. [ NewsFilter ] Open posting permits less rigorous items as well. The derisive term for this on MetaFilter is NewsFilter (or similar -Filter names for specific news topics, e.g. IraqFilter). Links to op-eds with no other point or framing are strongly discouraged and frequently deleted, as it is thought that they generate controversy without informing [ January 2009 ]. Nevertheless, it is accepted that some discussion of current events and politics in particular is inevitable, and a certain level is tolerated. If more than one post is made about a news topic, the extras are often deleted and discussion is redirected to the &quot; canonical &quot; post about the topic, usually the first one made. Important news items or political arguments can turn into very long discussions, such as 9/11 (2001), the London Bombings (2005), or Hurricane Katrina (2005) —which generated over 80 Front Page Posts in about a week. The first example of this was arguably the Nisqually earthquake of 2001. [ Investigations ] Because MetaFilter bans &quot; selflinks &quot; or posts by a person with a significant conflict of interest, posts tend to be scrutinized closely. Members of the site also have, several times, worked closely together to root out deception and scams. In May 2001, MetaFilter played a key role in uncovering the Kaycee Nicole hoax, [ http://www.sptimes.com/News/060301/news_pf/Worldandnation/Kaycee_chronicles__li.shtml Kaycee chronicles: life, death, deception Katie Hafner New York Times News Service May 31, 2001 2007-03-01 ] in which a woman made up a fake online persona of a teenage daughter who was dying of cancer, fooling many bloggers and garnering sympathy and gifts. [ http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/7819#84672 Comments on 7819 MetaFilter 2009-03-25 ] [ http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/7819#84697 Comments on 7819 MetaFilter 2009-03-25 ] [ http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/7819#84707 Comments on 7819 MetaFilter 2009-03-25 ] [ http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/7819#84799 Comments on 7819 MetaFilter 2009-03-25 ] In October 2004, MetaFilter members uncovered the identities of the writers of the hoax Web site Nick Nolte&apos;s Diary. { Greg Allen, &quot; The Positively True Adventures of the Counterfeit Diary of Nick Nolte &quot;, New York Times, October 31, 2004 } An astroturfing campaign by Holden Karnofsky, the co-founder of the online charity Givewell, was detected in January 2008 through a sockpuppet posting to Ask MetaFilter, leading to Karnofsky&apos;s resignation. [ http://philanthropy.com/giveandtake/index.php?id%3D424 GiveWell&apos;s Self-Promotion Ian Wilhelm January 2, 2008 Give &amp; Take Chronicle of Philanthropy 2008-01-22 ] In 2009, a user was responsible for detecting photoshopping by photographer Edgar Martins in a New York Times Magazine gallery, which was subsequently withdrawn. [ http://www.pdnpulse.com/2009/07/new-york-times-magazine-withdraws-possibly-altered-photo-essay.html New York Times Magazine Withdraws Altered Photo Essay Daryl Lang July 8, 2009 Photo District News 2009-07-08 ] [ September 2010 H3llBot ] [ Moderation ] One of MetaFilter&apos;s founding tenets and an important factor in the &quot; feel &quot; of the site is the idea that the bulk of moderation is done through social norms and peer pressure, referred to as &quot; self-policing &quot; in a site tagline. [ http://www.metafilter.com/ Metafilter &amp; #124; Community Weblog Web.archive.org 2009-09-23 http://web.archive.org/web/20030205142917/http%3A//www.metafilter.com/ 2003-02-05 ] Posts that do not meet the community&apos;s standards for quality are often &quot; called out &quot; to MetaTalk, an administrative area of the site, and interested members discuss how the post could have been improved, or, in some cases, ruthlessly mock the offender. (The community occasionally concludes, after discussion, that the call-out was unwarranted.) Moderators may step in and temporarily suspend an offending user&apos;s account, but this is rare; permanent bans are rarer still, and are generally reserved for spammers and other egregious abuses of the site. MetaTalk also sees particularly excellent posts called out for praise, and moderators regularly feature superlative contributions on the main page&apos;s sidebar. For the site&apos;s first few years, this practice of self-policing ensured a high level of quality and allowed Haughey to use a light touch in moderating the site; however, as the community has grown, Haughey has expanded the site&apos;s staff and taken a more active role. In 2004, Jessamyn West began assisting him with moderation duties; in 2007, user Josh Millard ( &quot; cortex &quot; ) was appointed as an additional moderator. In 2008, London user Ricardo Vacapinta assumed off-hours moderator duties [ http://metatalk.metafilter.com/16259/New-Overlord#544344 vacapinta announced as new moderator jessamyn ], and in April 2011 Jeremy Preacher (restless_nomad) came on to keep an eye on things over the weekend. [ http://metatalk.metafilter.com/20541/Everybodys-workin-on-the-weekend Everybody&apos;s workin on the weekend jessamyn ] { http://faq.metafilter.com/#33 } A flagging feature allows members to call moderator attention to substandard, offensive, or outstanding posts, allowing users continued input towards shaping the site while quickly alerting site staff to potential trouble spots. Haughey has long resisted adding killfile s and Slashdot -style scoring systems to MetaFilter, as he feels the former would fragment the community and the latter would result in users trying to &quot; game &quot; the system. [ Subsites at MetaFilter ] As discussed above under Moderation, an administrative area known as MetaTalk, or MeTa for short, allows for meta-discussion of the community, including bug reports, feature requests, and &quot; self-policing. &quot; In 2003, Ask MetaFilter was launched. This forum allows members to post questions to the community, without the link requirement. AskMe quickly grew to a strong side community with slightly different etiquette requirements and many daily threads covering a very broad spectrum of topics. At the end of 2005, Metafilter Projects was launched. This area of the site is for members to announce Web projects they have been working on—the one place on the site where so-called &quot; self-linking &quot; is permitted. Members can vote on projects, and often post interesting projects to the main site following the same guidelines as any other post. In 2006, MetaFilter Music launched. This site allows users to upload their own musical creations, which others can listen to via a Flash player, along with playlist and favorites features. Later, August 24 2006, MetaFilter Jobs was added. This section was created for members to post job openings.
