[ drake ] [ morgan ] [ outcasts ] [ balboa ] { Rupert Boneham } { Jon &quot; Jonny Fairplay &quot; Dalton } { Sandra Diaz-Twine, } { Rupert Boneham } Survivor: Pearl Islands (also broadcast as Survivor: Pearl Islands — Panama) is the seventh season of the United States reality show Survivor. It was filmed in 2003 and debuted in the United States on CBS on September 18, 2003. The show takes place on the Pearl Islands, off the coast of Panama, and had a pirate culture theme. The two original tribes were Drake (named for Sir Francis Drake ) and Morgan (named for Henry Morgan ). Eventually the two were merged into the Balboa tribe (named after the injured snake Rupert found). Office clerk Sandra Diaz-Twine defeated Scoutmaster Lillian Morris in a landslide 6-1 vote. The complete season, including the Live Reunion Show, was released on DVD on February 7, 2006. Pearl Islands has been represented in three of the succeeding seasons that featured returning contestants. Rupert Boneham returned to the Pearl Islands for Survivor: All-Stars, placing 4th. Jon &quot; Jonny Fairplay &quot; Dalton briefly participated in Survivor: Micronesia, before getting voted out in the first episode. While neither won either of these seasons, Boneham did win $ 1,000,000 in Survivor: America&apos;s Tribal Council, several days after the All-Stars finale. Boneham again returned to Survivor with Pearl Islands winner Sandra Diaz-Twine to participate in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains, the 20th season of Survivor. Boneham was a member of the Heroes Tribe and Diaz-Twine was a Member of the Villains&apos; Tribe. Boneham finished 6th while Diaz-Twine was the winner, making her the first two-time winner of Survivor. [ Season summary ] The start of the game was announced as a surprise to the contestants, who were told that they would be participating in the clothes on their backs, most believing they were getting publicity shots prior to the contest, and that no additional supplies would be given to them. The contestants were split into the two tribes, Morgan and Drake, and given their running shoes, a small bag of money and a map to a nearby village where they could use the money to buy what they believed were essential goods for survival as well as a boat trip to their beach, and were told to swim the rest of the way. Drake, thanks in part to Sandra&apos;s ability to speak Spanish and Rupert&apos;s idea of stealing the abandoned shoes of Morgan and using them as bartering goods, was able to secure numerous supplies, while Morgan did not plan as well. A twist revealed for the season sent one player from the tribe winning reward to steal one item from the other tribe&apos;s camp. Morgan lost most of the initial Reward and Immunity challenges, leaving them three players down and with fewer items to work with at camp. During this time, Osten, a member of Morgan, began to express a desire to quit the game. With Drake apparently set to continue to win, Burton concocted a plan to throw the fourth Immunity challenge in order to get rid of the tribe&apos;s weaker players, among them Trish and Christa. Though Rupert and others felt this was a bad idea, they went through with it anyway, purposely allowing Morgan to win. In a twist, Jeff Probst revealed that Morgan had won the right to &quot; kidnap &quot; one Drake member for a period to extend through the next Reward challenge, and Morgan quickly selected Rupert. As a result, Burton was voted out at Drake&apos;s first tribal council. The shift in power led to Morgan&apos;s winning the next two Immunity challenges and leaving the tribes equal in size, each having five members. Upon arrival at their next challenge, the tribes found they faced another twist, as the six voted-off players were returned to the game as an &quot; Outcast tribe &quot;. In the subsequent challenge, the outcasts&apos; tribe beat out Morgan and Drake; both would be required to vote off a player at separate tribal councils, while the Outcasts&apos; tribe would vote in two players to return to the game in their places. Osten used this opportunity to quit the game at tribal council. Jeff Probst expressed open disgust at Osten&apos;s decision to quit. The Outcasts&apos; tribe selected Lillian and Burton to return to the game, both, by chance, returning to their original tribes but having immunity at the next tribal council. While Burton made up with his former tribe, Lillian&apos;s return was resented by Andrew and other Morgan members. The next day, the two tribes merged into Balboa, a name given to a sea snake Rupert had found and tried unsuccessfully to nurse back to health. The tribe moved to Drake&apos;s beach. Burton and Rupert managed to gain individual immunities, and, along with Lillian&apos;s resentment, helped to voted out former Morgan members Andrew and Ryan O., gaining the numbers for the former Drake. Jon and Burton began seeing Rupert as a physical threat for challenges and conspired to vote him off, irking Rupert&apos;s alliance members Sandra and Christa. In the next reward challenge, where family and loved ones of the contestants were brought to the islands, Jon had conspired weeks before with his best friend to present the tale of a &quot; dead grandmother &quot;, hoping to use it to gain sympathy. Though Sandra saw through the lie, Jon convinced the other players, causing them to give up the reward to him, which caused them to spend the night on Morgan&apos;s old beach while Jon and his friend hung out alone, celebrating the success of their plot. Jon and Burton continued to conspire against the remaining female players, voting off Tijuana and Christa. With five players remaining, Burton won a car reward and took Jon with him as he drove away from camp. This allowed Sandra, Lillian, and Darrah to hatch a plan to vote off Burton, having Sandra act as if the next vote was settled and that she would be eliminated. Burton and Jon dismissed the possibility that the woman were working against them, and to his surprise, Burton was voted off at the following tribal council, leaving Jon in a scramble to try to win back any of the women&apos;s favor. The following immunity challenge included yet another twist, in that it consisted of a trivia contest with the current jury playing; this was a fifth challenger and it effectively denied any of the remaining players immunity. Darrah was voted off, leaving Jon, Lillian, and Sandra as the final three. During the final immunity challenge, Sandra fell out early, allowing Jon to try to convince Lillian to take him to the final two. Lillian refused and outlasted Jon, winning immunity. Lillian struggled with her decision of whom to take to the final tribal council but ultimately selected Sandra. During the final tribal council, Lillian&apos;s behavior during the game was contrasted with what people expected of a scoutmaster, questions Lillan had a hard time answering to their satisfaction. Sandra was voted the Sole Survivor on a vote of 6-1; Tijuana cast the lone vote for Lillian, later explaining that she was swayed by Sandra&apos;s declaration that Lillian was responsible for voting out everyone on the final jury, which indicated to her that Lillian played effectively. In the subsequent reunion show, several jury members responded to Jeff&apos;s question about a potential Lillian-Jon Final 2 by saying they would have given their votes to Lillian, who reiterated her belief that she would have lost to either Jon or Sandra, and voted out Jon because she had more respect for Sandra.

[ Lillian and Burton&apos;s return 1 ] Burton and Lillian were brought back into the game on Day 20, so they are both listed as having placed in two different points in the game. The tribes they were briefly in upon their return were the same tribes they were originally in. [ Episode 1 2 ] There was no Reward Challenge and was not yet known to the castaways. [ Sent post-merge 3 ] The sent rule was no longer applicable after the tribal merge, as there was only one tribe. [ Episode 9 4 ] There was no Reward Challenge for this episode due to The Outcasts&apos; Tribal Council. [ Immunity ep 8 5 ] Burton and Lillian were given automatic immunity for the next Tribal Council as a reward for having been voted back into the game by the Outcasts. Both were still allowed to compete in the Immunity Challenge, which Burton won. As he would still be immune, Burton passed the immunity necklace to Rupert at Tribal Council before voting commenced. [ Reward ep 9 6 ] Rupert won reward, but gave it to Burton. [ Reward ep 10 7 ] Burton and Lillian won reward. Burton gave Jon his reward, while Lillian kept hers. [ Immunity ep 11 8 ] Burton originally won immunity, but he lost it when Jeff Probst realized he&apos;d missed a misspelled word ( &quot; liaison &quot; ). Because of this, a runoff between those not already eliminated was conducted; Darrah eventually won immunity. [ Immunity finale 9 ] The immunity challenge was a trivia competition, and the five members of the Jury were allowed to compete as a team against the four remaining players. The Jury won the challenge, meaning that none of the four remaining players had immunity for that vote. [ Episode 1: &quot; Beg, Barter, Steal &quot; ] Immunity Challenge: Each tribe must transport a cannon through the jungle along a course that runs from one side of the island to the other. Along the course, the castaways must avoid several obstacles. The first tribe to bring their cannon to the finish line wins immunity. The sixteen contestants arrived at the Pearl Islands dressed in their street clothes. The contestants were shocked when they were told that they would be participating in the clothes on their backs, most believing they were getting publicity shots prior to the game. Host Jeff Probst threw the contestants&apos; sneakers overboard, and they were given a sack of Panamanian currency. The two tribes, Morgan and Drake, were sent to buy surviving essentials at a local village. When they reached the village, Morgan was scrambling to get supplies, while Drake was more successful, as Sandra was able to speak Spanish with the locals. Morgan had left their shoes unattended, so Rupert took the opportunity to steal their shoes so he could buy goods for his tribe. Meanwhile, Morgan member Osten traded all of his clothing, except for his boxers to buy goods for his tribe. After they were finished buying goods, the tribes got on their marine vessel s and traveled to their respective islands. On Night 1, Morgan had trouble sleeping, as rocks were falling from above, and crabs were biting the members. Meanwhile, Drake decided to celebrate their new home by drinking Panamanian wine, which they had bought at the village. Jon became incredibly drunk, which annoyed his tribemates. When morning came, the dehydrated Morgan tribe was relieved to find directions to a freshwater well on their map. At the well, Lillian and Ryan S. bonded while filling their canteen s. At the immunity challenge, Osten took off his boxers, which had been loose due to the weight he had lost. Other male members of Morgan also stripped naked. Morgan had a lead, however just before the finish line, their cannon got stuck in the sand, causing Drake to pull ahead and win the challenge. After they had lost, the Morgan tribe was upset, but Andrew tried to cheer his tribe up by giving them a pep talk. Nicole wanted to oust Tijuana, but when Tijuana heard of Nicole&apos;s plan, she decided she couldn&apos;t trust her. In the end, the vote went against Nicole as she was seen as dishonest and untrustworthy. [ Episode 2: &quot; To Quit or Not to Quit &quot; ] Reward: Both tribes were given a shovel. Probst explained that there is an actual treasure buried at each camp. The winning tribe would be given the first of three pieces to a map that will help them find the treasure. In addition, the winning tribe would have to send one member to the losing tribe&apos;s camp. The chosen member would have the right to take one item from the losing tribe&apos;s camp. Immunity Challenge: Each tribe would capture three members of the opposing tribe. The other castaways must try to free their captured tribemates, and then overcome a series of obstacles in order to raise their flag. First tribe to raise their flag wins immunity. The Morgan tribe had trouble sleeping as the cold nights had taken their toll on the contestants. Over at Drake, Rupert caught fish for his tribe. After receiving Tree Mail about the upcoming Reward Challenge, Ryan S. felt that he was under a lot of pressure to do well in the challenge. As Ryan S. started swimming, he had trouble with his mask as well as staying underwater giving Drake an early lead. Morgan never got back on track, giving Drake their second win in a row. In a twist, the winning tribe, Drake, had to send one member to the Morgan camp to take one of their items back with them. Drake sent Sandra, who chose to take Morgan&apos;s tarp. Sandra got mad when the Morgan tribe wouldn&apos;t help her take the tarp down, so she proceeded to take apart their shelter piece by piece. While trying to rebuild their shelter, Osten announced that he was considering quitting the game, which upset Andrew. Meanwhile, at Drake, Shawn went fishing and lost the head of his tribe&apos;s fishing spear, which upset Rupert. Rupert searched underwater for the lost head, and wound up finding it. He was so happy that he let out a loud roar. Once again, Morgan lost the immunity challenge. Osten surprised his tribemates by asking to be voted off, which disappointed Tijuana. In the end, Osten did not get his wish, as the vote went against the tribe&apos;s weakest link, Ryan S. (5-2) [ Episode 3: &quot; United We Stand, Divided We...? &quot; ] Reward: Blanket s, mattress es, pillow s, and a piece of the map to the buried treasure. Immunity Challenge: The strongest member of each tribe must suspend the smallest member above the ocean using a rope -and- pulley system. The first person to drop the rope and their suspended tribemate would lose immunity. The Morgan tribe quietly thought about their misfortunes. The Drake tribe decided to look for their buried treasure. They had guessed that it would be along the shoreline, therefore it would only be accessible during the low tide. However, the Drake tribe did not succeed in finding the treasure, so they decided to take a break and check another time. Jon wanted Sandra to sit out at the Reward Challenge, as he thought she was a weak swimmer, which angered Sandra. Once again, Drake ended up winning the Reward Challenge, which left Morgan distraught. The next morning, Lillian woke up early to go on a fishing trip and lost the tribe&apos;s fishing hook. Meanwhile, Drake decided not to look for the treasure, so they discussed what item they should take from the Morgan camp. They decided they should take Morgan&apos;s water pot. Christa was sent to the Morgan camp to take the pot. When Christa arrived at Morgan&apos;s camp, the Morgan tribe asked many questions about Drake. Christa tried not to reveal too much about her tribe, which she found difficult. At the immunity challenge, it came down to Morgan&apos;s Osten, and Drake&apos;s Rupert. Probst decided to add difficulty to the challenge by forcing Osten and Rupert to stand, and then he forbidden them to rest the rope on the wooden braces in front of them. Osten couldn&apos;t hold the rope any longer, giving Drake immunity. At Morgan, Andrew decided that Lillian was the least valuable, and that she should be the next one to go. Andrew spoke with Lillian to let her know that she was on the chopping block. Lillian became the third person voted off of Survivor: Pearl Islands. (5-1) [ Episode 4: &quot; Pick a Castaway...Any Castaway &quot; ] Reward: A sewing kit and a piece of the map to the buried treasure. { Immunity Challenge: Each castaway must cross a human } { checkerboard over water. When a castaway is face-to-face with an opposing tribe member, a hand-to-hand clash would occur. Whichever castaway loses balance first will have to start over. First tribe to get all of their members across wins immunity. In addition, the winning tribe will have the right to kidnap a member of the opposing tribe. } The Morgan tribe was at risk of losing their shelter due to the rising tide. They built a breaker wall out of sand to try to protect their shelter. Meanwhile, having never voted anyone off, there was some tension at Drake due to clashing personalities. At the Reward Challenge, Morgan fell behind as Osten had trouble swimming, giving Drake a lead. However Drake member Trish had trouble digging out one of Drake&apos;s pieces, allowing Morgan to make a comeback. However, Drake solved their puzzle just before Morgan could, giving Drake yet another win, and the final piece to their treasure map. With all three pieces, Drake had a good idea where to look for the treasure. They got somewhat confused when they had to find a spot on the map called &quot; Devil&apos;s Fork &quot;. Drake was overcome with joy when Shawn hit the treasure chest with the shovel. The tribe gathered to see what the chest contained. Inside, there were goblet s, candle s, candleholders, canned foods, sugar, honey, blankets, coffee beans, and chocolate. Over at Morgan, Andrew and Ryan O. went to the other side of the island to fish, however they came back with no fish. The Drake tribe sent Trish to the Morgan camp, who Morgan greeted. Trish decided to take Morgan&apos;s lantern. Over at Drake, Burton proposed to Rupert that they throw the next Immunity Challenge to get rid of one of the weaker women. Rupert agreed to throw the challenge. At the Immunity Challenge, Drake sat out two of their strongest players, Burton and Rupert, giving Morgan an advantage. Morgan won their first challenge, sending Drake to Tribal Council for the first time. After Morgan won, Probst announced that they had the right to kidnap one member of Drake. Morgan decided to kidnap Rupert. When Drake lost, there were many alliances in place, with Jon as a possible swing vote. Several tribemates lobbied Jon for his vote. In the end, the vote went against Burton, who was blindsided by a secret alliance that included his closest friend, Shawn. (5-2) [ Episode 5: &quot; Everyone&apos;s Hero &quot; ] Reward: A portable shower, a pot for boiling water, two jerrycan s, rain jackets, sponges, shampoo and conditioner. { Immunity Challenge: Each castaway must spin a wheel, which will determine which two ingredients would be blended together for them to drink. The ingredients were red } { shellfish, } { sardine s, } { razor clam s, bleeding clams, sea water, } { squid, mango, rock } { oysters, } { conch, } { octopus, } { coconut juice, and an ingredient of Jeff&apos;s choice. The first person unable to keep their concoction down will lose immunity for their whole tribe. } With Rupert still at their camp, the Morgan tribe moved their shelter to avoid the rising tide. Meanwhile, Drake decided to save their last can of spam for Rupert when he returns. Some Drake members were worried that Rupert may have given too much information to the Morgan tribe. At the Reward Challenge, Drake fell behind as they lost control of their boat due to Jon&apos;s faulty navigating. Morgan found their golden idol and quickly assembled their ladder, winning their first Reward Challenge. After Morgan won, Rupert was offered a chance to return to the Morgan camp to enjoy a shower. However, Rupert decided to return to his Drake camp. Winning the challenge, Morgan had to send one member to the Drake camp to take one item. They chose Andrew, who took a bag of rice from Drake. When Drake got Tree Mail inviting them to an Immunity Challenge that likely involved eating exotic seafood, they decided to strategize. Michelle claimed to have a high tolerance for eating undesirable foods, so Drake decided to use her as a decoy. Their plan was that Michelle would pretend to have trouble downing the food in order to fool Morgan into competing with her in the event of a tiebraker. At the Immunity Challenge, both tribes gulped down the concoctions all the way to a tie. However, when it was time for Morgan to choose a Drake member, they chose Sandra and not Michelle. Sandra was able to drink her concoction, however she had trouble swallowing it, allowing Morgan&apos;s Darrah to win immunity for her tribe, forcing Drake to vote out a second person. Sandra and Michelle both felt vulnerable. Jon was upset at Michelle for not pretending to have trouble drinking the concoction. In the end, the vote went against Michelle. (6-1) [ Episode 6: &quot; Me and My Snake &quot; ] Reward: A grill, spice s, lobster s, and steak. Should Morgan win, they would receive their second piece of the map to their treasure. { Immunity Challenge: Tribe members would hold a pole on their shoulders behind their neck. Periodically, weight would be added to the poles. The castaways would decide which poles the weight would added on for the opposing tribe. Last tribe standing wins immunity. } The Drake tribe was upset when Balboa, a baby snake Rupert found, was found dead. A local pelican came to the Morgan camp against Osten&apos;s wishes. Morgan nicknamed the pelican &quot; Pelican Pete &quot;. Osten feared the pelican and threatened it with a machete, amusing his tribemates. After Rupert suggested that they raise the floor of the Drake shelter, the Drake tribe got to work. Jon and Sandra were annoyed at Shawn due to his complaining. At the Reward Challenge, it was a very close competition. It came down to Andrew from Morgan and Christa from Drake. Andrew missed his target, allowing Christa to hit her target. Christa was successful, winning reward for Drake. The Drake barbecued their steaks, and enjoyed their feast. Jon was sent to the Morgan camp to take an item. Jon took their water pot and enjoyed shampoo. While at Morgan, Jon revealed that Drake had thrown one of the Immunity Challenges, which irritated Andrew. At the Immunity Challenge, Morgan chose to add all of the weight to Rupert&apos;s pole, while Drake decided to spread the weight evenly among the Morgan tribe. Morgan&apos;s strategy worked, as Rupert could not hold the weight. In the end, Christa couldn&apos;t compete against that last two Morgan men left, giving Morgan yet another immunity win. After losing immunity, Trish wanted to oust Rupert as she saw him as a threat. Her alliance needed Shawn to complete the plan. But Christa caught the exchange and told Rupert about the plan started a secret alliance of their own. In the end, Shawn flipped and Trish&apos;s plan backfired, as she was voted off 4-2. [ Episode 7: &quot; What the...?, Part 1 &quot; ] Additional Stipulation: Drake and Morgan are competing against the Outcasts, rather than each other. Any tribe that finishes behind the Outcasts must go to Tribal Council and vote out a member. The Outcasts will then hold a special Tribal Council in which they will vote members back into the game, enough to replace each person that just left. Those returning will be given automatic immunity for the next Tribal Council. If the Outcasts finish last, Drake and Morgan will be safe, and all six Outcasts leave the game permanently. While returning to camp from Tribal Council, Rupert was enraged at Jon as Rupert had suspected that Jon had voted for him. Jon admitted to voting for Rupert, and the two apologized for the good of their tribe. Over at Morgan, the rainy weather prevented the hungry tribe members from fishing. They were eating their diminishing supply of rice and beans. When the contestants arrived at the Reward Challenge, they were shocked to see the castaways they had previously voted off return as a ghost tribe, The Outcasts — Nicole, Ryan S., Lillian, Burton, Michelle, and Trish. The Immunity Challenge would be between three tribes, the first one in Survivor history. Morgan fell behind in the challenge as Drake took the lead, with The Outcasts not far behind. In the end, The Outcasts managed to unlock the last door, cross the finish line, and win the challenge, sending both Morgan and Drake to Tribal Council. After the challenge, Morgan was upset that they would have to let one of The Outcasts back into their tribe. Osten asked his tribemates to vote him off. Over at Drake, Jon and Shawn were both on the chopping block. The tribe decided to let the two make their case as to why they should stay. Shawn spoke of trust, while Jon spoke of work ethic. In the end, work ethic proved to be more important as Shawn was voted out, 4-1. Soon after, at the Morgan Tribal Council, Osten decided to take the opportunity to quit the game. Osten&apos;s torch was snuffed and put to rest on the ground for the remainder of the season. In addition, his closing speech was replaced by footage of Morgan departing Tribal Council and ending with a close-up shot of his now laid-down torch. [ Episode 8: &quot; What the...?, Part 2 &quot; ] Immunity Challenge: Each castaway must pull themselves along a rope under a floating wood platform without coming up for air. The challenge ran in two heats. The two winners of each heat would compete against each other in the final heat. The winner of the final heat wins individual immunity. The Outcasts, a tribe consisting of the first six departed castaways, had to vote two people back into the game. At The Outcasts&apos; Tribal Council, each Outcast made their plea as to why they should be voted back into the game. After the voting, it was decided in a 3-3-2-2-1-1 vote, that Burton and Lillian would return to represent the Outcasts. After randomly selecting who would go to which tribe, Burton returned to Drake and Lillian returned to Morgan. When Burton returned to Drake, his tribe apologized, and were happy to have him back. When Lillian returned to Morgan, she was welcomed by her old tribe, however she wasn&apos;t sure if she could trust them, especially Andrew, who was still visibly resentful toward her. Over at Drake, Burton, Christa and Rupert made an alliance to vote out Jon at their next Tribal Council. They thought that Jon&apos;s lack of honesty could work against them once the tribes merge. When the two tribes arrived at what they thought would be a Reward Challenge, Probst announced that the tribes were merging and it was decided that Drake&apos;s camp would be better to live in. After the announcement of the merge, the first individual Immunity Challenge took place, in which Burton won. When the castaways arrived at camp, they named the merged tribe &quot; Balboa &quot; after Rupert&apos;s pet snake. The hungry castaways then saw a merge feast ready for them. Having been voted out of Morgan and then returned, Lillian was the potential swing vote for the next Tribal Council. At Tribal Council, Burton decided to give the Immunity Necklace to Rupert, since he [and Lillian] were already immune due to the resurrection vote. In the end, Lillian joined the former Drake members to pay revenge to Andrew, who was eliminated in a 6-4 vote. [ Episode 9: &quot; Shocking! Simply Shocking! &quot; ] Reward: Pancakes and maple syrup, bacon and egg s, sweet rolls, orange juice to enjoyed in a remote, attractive location. { Immunity Challenge: The Immunity Challenge involved a trivia test based on local } { pirate } { lore. Each castaway who answers correctly would get to place coconuts in the bins of those who answered incorrectly. When a castaway receives five coconuts, they are out of the challenge. Last castaway standing wins immunity. } As morning came, Lillian got up early and celebrated her renewed life in the game by being the first to get to work. After his strongest ally was ousted, Ryan O. feared that he was on the chopping block. While fishing, Ryan O. tried to align himself with Burton to oust former Drake members Christa, Rupert, and Sandra. When Burton returned from fishing, he returned with an electric ray, although he still wanted to cook it and enjoy the meat. At the Reward Challenge, Ryan O. won the first heat, Rupert won the second, and Lillian won the third. Rupert won the final round. Rupert decided to give his reward to Burton, who took Lillian along with him. While Burton and Lil were having breakfast, Burton brought up a plan to eliminate Rupert as soon as possible. The plan was for Lillian to eliminate Rupert by creating an alliance with Darrah and Tijuana, while lying to Christa and Rupert. At camp, Sandra and Christa contemplated eliminating Rupert and Burton. At the Immunity Challenge, Ryan O. was quickly eliminated. The challenge&apos;s final two were Rupert and Christa. Rupert answered the final question correctly and placed the fifth coconut into Christa&apos;s bin, winning immunity. Knowing that he could be next to go, Ryan O. tried to create alliances with Burton, then Tijuana and Darrah. Rupert was worried that Ryan O. could be successful. In the end, the vote went against Ryan O., and he became the first member of the jury. (8-1) [ Episode 10: &quot; Swimming With Sharks &quot; ] Reward: A trip on a luxury catamaran with pizza and beer. { Immunity Challenge: The castaways must use a } { blowgun. Each castaway was designated an area on a large target. The castaways must try to use their blowgun to knock out the other player&apos;s darts into the other castaways areas. Last player left in the challenge wins immunity. } Jon was annoyed at the arrogance from the Christa, Rupert, and Sandra alliance. Jon and Burton made a plan to break that alliance. They planned to align with Darrah and Tijuana. While Rupert was fishing and Christa and Sandra were getting lemons, Jon and Burton made efforts to align with Darrah and Tijuana. The two women agreed to align with Jon and Burton. At the Reward Challenge, it was a tight race between the team of Burton and Lillian and the team of Christa and Darrah. Darrah missed the rope that Christa tossed, allowing Burton and Lillian to advance to the final round. Meanwhile, over at the other round, Rupert and Jon had a lead over Tijuana and Sandra. In the end, Rupert and Jon won their round. The final round was between the team of Burton and Lillian and the team of Rupert and Jon. It was a tight race, however Burton and Lillian finished the puzzle first, winning reward. Burton decided to give his reward to Jon, while Lillian kept hers. Back at camp, Rupert&apos;s trust for Burton was dwindling after Burton chose to give his reward to Jon over Rupert. While Jon and Lillian enjoyed their reward, Jon told Lillian how she could convince Rupert, Christa and Sandra that she was on their side, when in reality, she&apos;s actually aligned with Burton, Darrah, Jon and Tijuana. When Lillian and Jon returned to camp, Rupert tried to align with Lillian. Lillian managed to convince Rupert that she was loyal to his alliance, when in reality she was aligned with Burton, Darrah, Jon and Tijuana. At the Immunity Challenge, Rupert had an early lead. However, in the end, it came down to Burton, Jon and Lillian. Burton ended up winning immunity. Back at camp, the alliance of Burton, Darrah, Jon, Lillian, and Tijuana pretended that Darrah was going to be next one to go, however Rupert didn&apos;t trust them fully. Still convinced that Lillian was on his side, Rupert thought that there would be a tie. At Tribal Council, Rupert was blindsided when Lillian voted against him and Sandra voted for Jon. (Sandra&apos;s vote ensured the result, even if Lillian had remained true.) He was voted off 5-2-1 and became the second member of the jury. [ Episode 11: &quot; The Great Lie &quot; ] Reward: A day with a loved one. { Immunity Challenge: Each castaway has a board with three words on it broken up by letters &quot; SURVIVOR PEARL ISLANDS &quot;. The castaways must use the letters to form twenty new words. Words must be in English and must be spelled correctly. Plurals, proper names, acronyms are not allowed as well as &quot; SURVIVOR &quot;, &quot; PEARL &quot; and &quot; ISLANDS &quot; are not allowed as well. If a castaway broke any of these rules, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge. First player to form twenty words spelled correctly wins immunity. } After Rupert was voted out, Sandra was furious at Jon for breaking their alliance. After Sandra&apos;s yelling, the Balboa tribe members noticed that someone had thrown away a bucket of fish Rupert had caught. Christa was blamed for it, however Sandra admitted in an interview that she had spilled the fish. At the Reward Challenge, the castaways were reunited with their loved ones. Before the challenge started, Jon was saddened to hear that his grandmother had died. When the challenge started, Sandra chose Jon&apos;s best friend Dan to take a step on the plank. Jon was upset, as he wanted to hear the details about his grandmother&apos;s death. Sandra&apos;s husband was the first loved one sent into the ocean, followed by Christa&apos;s fiancé, Darrah&apos;s boyfriend, Burton&apos;s mother, then Tijuana&apos;s friend. With Lillian&apos;s husband and Jon&apos;s friend left, Burton was the one who decided which one would jump off the plank. Feeling sorry for Jon, Burton sent Lillian&apos;s husband off the plank. When Jon won reward, he learned that him and his friend would share the camp on their own, with the other castaways banished to a separate island (formerly the Morgan tribe&apos;s island) without their loved ones. While Jon and his friend Dan were alone at the Balboa camp, they revealed that the story about Jon&apos;s grandmother&apos;s death was preplanned, and that she&apos;s actually still alive. Jon and Dan celebrated alone. When the rest of Balboa returned, Sandra and Christa attempted to get Tijuana to break her alliance with Burton, Jon, and Lillian. During the night, as Burton and Jon went away from camp to talk about strategy, Sandra called Tijuana to come with her and listen to Burton and Jon&apos;s strategic talk. Sandra did this to ensure there was no doubt about the alliance between Burton, Jon, and Lillian. Sandra and Tijuana returned before Jon and Burton, and Tijuana told Darrah what she heard. At the start of the Immunity Challenge, the castaways had trouble forming words that are spelled correctly. Christa first thought she got it, but incorrectly spelled a word ( &quot; er &quot; not &quot; ar &quot; at the end of a word seven or more letters long, possibly &quot; LAVENDAR &quot; should be spelled &quot; LAVENDER &quot; ). Then, Tijuana thought she had it, but broke the rules by choosing a plural ( &quot; nails &quot; ). Jon was then eliminated for misspelling a word &quot; SANDLE &quot; instead of &quot; SANDAL &quot;. Later, Burton initially won immunity, however as the castaways were heading back to camp, Probst called them back, announcing that he had failed to notice a misspelled word on his board. Burton spelled &quot; LIASON &quot;, but it was missing an &quot; I &quot; and should be spelled &quot; LIAISON &quot;. Burton was stripped of immunity, and the challenge was restarted because some of the castaways looked at other people&apos;s boards and possibly began discussing words with each other. As a result, an alternate challenge was given with Darrah, Lillian, and Sandra competing against each other, since they weren&apos;t eliminated from the challenge. After one minute of writing four or more letter words from the phrase, &quot; OUTWIT OUTPLAY OUTLAST &quot;, Darrah ended up winning immunity with 14 to Lillian&apos;s 10 and Sandra&apos;s 12. After Darrah won immunity, Jon and Burton were worried that they were on the chopping block as the women outnumbered the men. Knowing that women of the former Morgan tribe wanted Burton out, Jon tried to create an alliance with Sandra and Christa, however Sandra said she didn&apos;t trust Jon. In the end, Jon ended up convincing the former Drake tribe and Lillian to vote out Tijuana 5-2 and she became the third member of the jury. [ Episode 12: &quot; Would You Be My Brutus Today? &quot; ] Reward: A night at a spa where the team would enjoy a shower and a massage followed by dinner. { Immunity Challenge: Each castaway would use old } { musket s to shoot at designated targets covered with } { kerosene. First castaway to set all three of their targets ablaze wins immunity. } After returning from Tribal Council in which Tijuana was voted out, Sandra and Christa had second thoughts about their alliance with Jon. They tried to break their alliance with him by attempting to align with Darrah. The team of Darrah, Jon, and Lillian won the reward challenge. After returning from the reward, Jon and Burton discussed voting out Christa next due to her being aligned with Rupert previously. At the immunity challenge, Christa took an early lead even though she had no experience of using guns, however Darrah quickly tied with Christa when she hit two of her targets. Christa just missed her final target, allowing Darrah to hit her final target and win immunity for the second time in a row. After the immunity challenge, Christa was told that Lillian was going home and vice versa. In the end, Christa was voted out 4-2 and became the fourth member of the jury. [ Episode 13: &quot; Mutiny &quot; ] Reward: A night in Panama City where the winner and the invitee would camp out in ruins and enjoy a feast. { Immunity Challenge: Each castaway must use a canteen to pour water in a tube that will lift a key to open a lock. The lock releases a rope, allowing the castaway to lower a plank into the water. First castaway to lower five planks and walk them wins immunity. } Back at camp, the girls talked about Burton and Jon&apos;s schemes. Lillian told Darrah she was the next to be eliminated for winning the last two immunity challenges. So, Lillian, Darrah, and Sandra all decided to form an all female alliance for the final three. They made a plan, where Sandra would act depressed by thinking she will be going home next because of the strong alliance of Burton, Jon, Darrah, and Lillian. However, the girls will all vote off Jon if Burton wins immunity or Burton if someone else wins immunity. In addition, Darrah and Sandra also made sure that Lillian won&apos;t spill the beans or change her mind in order to make sure the plan succeeds. The next day, when Burton and Jon returned to camp, only Darrah and Lillian were there to welcome her. Darrah and Lillian told the guys that Sandra was ready to leave and didn&apos;t strategize to vote either of them out. Burton was sceptical about it and asked Lillian questions about if it was true, while Jon approached Sandra and then decided to make a deal that it won&apos;t be her next to go home and sticking with the plan to vote off Darrah at the next tribal council by making Sandra swear on her kids. In reality, Sandra mouthed to herself that she swore on her kids to get rid of Jon and Burton. In the end, Burton was voted out 3-2 and became the fifth member of the jury. [ Episode 14: &quot; Flames and Endurance &quot; ] Immunity Challenge: The challenge would be a test of survival and pirate folklore knowledge. In a twist, the final four castaways would be competing against each other and the jury, which will be playing as a team. Should the jury win, none of the final four castaways would be immune. Should one of the remaining castaways win, that castaway would be safe from elimination. The final four was awakened by a motorboat, and were excited to see Jeff Probst come with breakfast and champagne. After their meal, they were excited to see letters from home. Knowing that he was on the chopping block, Jon told Darrah that it would be a good strategic move to vote out Lillian because she was a threat to gain jury votes. Lillian convinced Sandra that Darrah should go because of her three straight immunity wins. At the immunity challenge, the jury took an early lead, however Jon quickly tied the score. In the end, the jury answered the final question correctly, meaning that none of the remaining castaways were immune. At Tribal Council, Darrah was seen as a physical threat and she was voted out 3-1. Immunity Challenge: The final three must balance themselves on a small raft floating in the water. They could use their hands and feet for balance, but not their behind or knees. Last castaway on their raft wins immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final two. After receiving Tree Mail at midnight, the final three got up early to paddle to a shipwreck. Jeff Probst told them that they were about to take part in the ceremony for fallen castaways. After all the torches of those voted out (Osten&apos;s was left at Tribal Council) were placed on the wreck, the final three shot muskets at the shipwreck and it erupted and burned to the ground. At the immunity challenge, Jon and Sandra felt uncomfortable, while Lillian felt fine. Sandra fell early. Jon tried to make a final two deal with Lillian, however she refused because she felt she could beat him without a deal. After over two hours, Jon lost his balance, guaranteeing Lillian a spot in the final two. After Lillian won the final immunity challenge, Jon and Sandra both lobbied Lillian to take them to the final two. Jon argued that he was widely hated by the jury and that taking him to the final two would guarantee Lillian a million dollars. Sandra told Lillian that she has a family she&apos;d like to provide for. Lillian was still unsure of whom to take to the final two. After much consideration, Lillian decided to vote out Jon due to Sandra&apos;s motivation of providing for her family. At the final Tribal Council, Lillian talked about her honesty in her speech and admitted that it was a mistake to bring her Boy Scout uniform to the game. Sandra talked about her work ethic and said that she didn&apos;t ride any coattails. In the end, Sandra beat out Lillian to become the Sole Survivor in a 6-1 vote.
