[ History ] In 1859, John D. &quot; Colonel Jack &quot; Henderson built a ranch, trading post, and hotel on Henderson Island in the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. Henderson sold meat and provisions to gold seekers on their way up the South Platte River Trail to the gold fields during the Pike&apos;s Peak Gold Rush. Henderson Island was the first permanent settlement in the South Platte River Valley between Fort Saint Vrain in the Nebraska Territory and the Cherry Creek Diggings in the Kansas Territory. Henderson Island is today the site of the Adams County Regional Park and Fairgrounds. Among the first establishments in the modern Commerce City were cemeteries. Riverside Cemetery, founded in 1876, is located in the city&apos;s southwest corner at East 52nd Avenue and Brighton Boulevard. Rose Hill Cemetery, in the heart of historic Commerce City, was established in 1892 on what at the time was an open plain by the United Hebrew Cemetery Association. The first school in the area began in 1871 as a one-room schoolhouse, with other schools added in 1899 and later in 1907. This latter school is now part of the North Building at the former site of Adams City High School, now Adams 14 School District Administration Buildings. Several towns were founded in this part of Adams County in the 19th century. Derby, a Burlington Railroad station in 1887, was laid out as a town in 1889, although it was largely vacated by 1891. Irondale was first settled in 1889, named after a foundry that was opened that year. It was incorporated as the town of Irondale in 1924, but unincorporated in the 1930s due to increasing vacancy. Meanwhile, Adams City was laid out in 1903, with developers hoping the county seat would be established there; however, Brighton was elected county seat in 1904 and Adams City was vacated in 1922. Until the late 1920s, the area was devoted to agriculture, including wheat fields, dairies, and pig farms. Industry moved in, with a refinery established in 1930 and grain elevator s built in the late 1930s. Rocky Mountain Arsenal was founded in 1942 due east of the growing community. In 1946 and 1947, Adams County School District 14 was formed from surrounding schools, and Adams City was redeveloped about that time. In 1951, as Denver was considering annexing the area, a plan to incorporate all of southern Adams County was developed. On 1952-07-08, area residents voted 251 to 24 to incorporate Commerce Town, comprising neighborhoods such as Rose Hill and southern Adams City. Commerce Town annexed part of Derby in 1962, increasing the population over fourfold, enough for the town to gain the status of a city. The city name was duly changed to Commerce City.

The Mile High Kennel Club (grayhound racing park) is no longer operational. With the onset of widespread off-track gambling, the physical moving of races around the country to different parks became unnecessary. The City of Commerce City has purchased the land with future development use unknown at this time. A new Adams City High School has been constructed on land at 72nd and Quebec Street. This was formerly part of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. The new school campus opened in 2009.

Originally, this facility existed as two separately owned refineries, one on each side of Brighton Boulevard. Suncor Energy bought the west refinery from Conoco in 2003.

As a result of a lawsuit by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a number of states (including Colorado) alleging violations of the Clean Air Act, Valero agreed in June 2005 to make pollution -reducing changes to its refineries, including the Commerce City facility. Suncor&apos;s purchase agreement included an assumption of all liability from this suit.

The west plant was shut down in February 2006 to complete the upgrade, while the east plant continued to refine [ 34000 oilbbl m3 ] of oil per day. The completion of the $445 million project was announced in June 2006 and allows Suncor to meet the EPA&apos;s mandate to reduce the sulfur content of diesel fuel. It also gives the refinery the ability to process Suncor&apos;s Canadian sour crude oil sands. The combined facility is the largest refinery in the Rocky Mountain region.
