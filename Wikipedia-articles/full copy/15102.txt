The Island has many resorts which have been holiday destinations since Victorian times. The Island has a rich history, including a brief status as an independent kingdom in the 15th century. Until 1995, like Jersey and Guernsey, the Island had its own Governor —most notably Lord Mountbatten from 1969 to 1974, after which he became Lord Lieutenant until his assassination in 1979. It was home to the poets Swinburne and Alfred Lord Tennyson, and to Queen Victoria, who built her much-loved summer residence and final home Osborne House at East Cowes. The Island&apos;s maritime and industrial history encompasses boat building, sail making, the manufacture of flying boat s, the world&apos;s first hovercraft and the testing and development of Britain&apos;s space rockets. It is home to the Isle of Wight International Jazz Festival, Bestival and the recently revived Isle of Wight Festival, which, in 1970, was the largest rock music event ever held.

Until 1890 the Isle of Wight was part of Hampshire. Since then it has been an independent administrative county, though up to 1974 it continued to share the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire. In 1974, it was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan and ceremonial county, with its own Lord Lieutenant, and recognised as a postal county. With a single Member of Parliament and 132,731 permanent residents in 2001, it is also the most populous parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom. In 1832 the act popularly referred to as the Great Reform Act or Reform Act of 1832 established the principle of having a single MP for the Isle of Wight.

Several ferry services operate across the Solent: the route from Southampton to Cowes is 10  miles (16  km), Portsmouth to Ryde 5  miles (8  km), Portsmouth to Fishbourne 7  miles (11  km), and Lymington to Yarmouth 4  miles (6  km). [ History ] [ History of the Isle of Wight ] [ Early history ] The Isle of Wight is first mentioned in writing in Geography by Claudius Ptolemaeus. The Roman historian Suetonius mentions that the entire island was captured by the commander Vespasian, who later became emperor. At the end of the Roman Empire, the island of Vectis became a Jutish kingdom ruled by King Stuf and his successors until AD 661 when it was invaded by Wulfhere of Mercia and forcibly converted to Christianity at sword point. When he left for Mercia the islanders reverted to paganism. In AD 685 it was invaded by Caedwalla of Wessex and can be considered to have become part of Wessex. Following the accession of West Saxon kings as kings of all England, it then became part of England. The island became part of the shire of Hampshire and was divided into hundreds as was the norm. In 686, it became the last part of England to convert to Christianity. { &apos;&apos;Saxon Graves at Shalfleet&apos;&apos;, Isle of Wight History Centre, August, 2005 } [ http://www.britannia.com/history/narsaxhist.html &apos; &amp; #39;England, A Narrative History&apos; &amp; #39;, Peter N. Williams Britannia.com 25 September 2010 ] { &apos;&apos;The English Accept Christianity&apos;&apos;, The Story of England, Samuel B. Harding } The island suffered especially from Viking predations. Alfred the Great &apos;s navy defeated the Danes in 871 after they had &quot; ravaged Devon and the Isle of Wight &quot;. [ Middle ages ] Carisbrooke Castle in Carisbrooke The Norman Conquest created the position of Lord of the Isle of Wight. Carisbrooke Priory and the fort of Carisbrooke Castle were founded. The island did not come under full control of the Crown until it was sold by the dying last Norman Lord, Lady Isabella de Fortibus, to Edward I in 1293. In 1374, the Castilian fleet, led by Fernán Sánchez de Tovar, the 1st Lord of Belves, sacked and burned the island. The Lordship thereafter became a royal appointment, with a brief interruption when Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick was in 1444 crowned King of the Isle of Wight, { William Camden, Britain, or, a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland (London, 1610) } with King Henry VI assisting in person at the ceremony, placing the crown on his head. With no male heir, the regal title expired on the death of Henry de Beauchamp in 1446. Henry VIII, who developed the Royal Navy and its permanent base at Portsmouth, fortified the island at Yarmouth, Cowes, East Cowes, and Sandown. Much later, after the Spanish Armada in 1588, the threat of Spanish attacks remained and the outer fortifications of Carisbrooke Castle were built between 1597 and 1602. [ Civil war ] During the English Civil War King Charles fled to the Isle of Wight, believing he would receive sympathy from the governor, Robert Hammond. Hammond was appalled, and imprisoned the king in Carisbrooke Castle. Charles had originally intended to flee to Jersey, but became lost in the New Forest and missed the boat. { Osborne House and its grounds are now open to the public } [ Seven Years War ] [ Great Britain in the Seven Years War ] During the Seven Years War, the island was used as a staging post for British troops departing on expeditions against the French coast such as the Raid on Rochefort. During 1759 with a planned French invasion imminent, a large force of soldiers were kept there so they could be moved at speed to any destination on the Southern English Coast. The French called off their invasion following the Battle of Quiberon Bay. A later French invasion plan involved a landing on the Isle of Wight. { Longmate, Norman. Island Fortress: The Defence of Great Britain, 1603–1945. London, 2001. p.186-88 } [ Queen Victoria ] Queen Victoria made Osborne House on the Isle of Wight her summer home for many years and, as a result, it became a major holiday resort for fashionable Victorians including Alfred Lord Tennyson, Julia Margaret Cameron, Charles Dickens (who wrote much of David Copperfield there) and members of European royalty. During her reign, in 1897, the world&apos;s first radio station [ http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Telecommunicationsage/Awirelessworld/Theoriginsofradio/index.htm The origins of radio Connected Earth 18 January 1903 25 September 2010 ] [ November 2010 H3llBot ] was set up by Marconi, at The Needles Battery, at the western tip of the island. [ Modern history ] During the Second World War the island was frequently bombed. With its proximity to France the island also had a number of observation stations and transmitters, and was the starting-point for one of the earlier Operation Pluto pipelines to feed fuel to the Normandy landings. The Needles battery was used as the site for testing and development of the Black Arrow and Black Knight space rockets, subsequently launched from Woomera, Australia. The Isle of Wight Festival was a very large rock festival that took place near Afton Down, West Wight in 1970, following two smaller concerts in 1968 and 1969. The 1970 show was notable both for being one of the last public performances by Jimi Hendrix and for the number of attendees reaching, by many estimates, 600,000. [ http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie.aspx?m%3D32552 Movies Movies.msn.com 25 September 2010 ] The festival was revived in 2002 in a different format and is now an annual event. [ Physical geography and wildlife ] Isle of Wight Map The Isle of Wight is approximately diamond-shaped and covers an area of 380  km 2. Slightly more than half of the island, mainly in the west, is designated as the Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Island has 258  km 2 of farmland, 52  km 2 of developed areas, and 92  km of coastline. The landscape of the Island is remarkably diverse, leading to its oft-quoted description of &quot; England in Miniature &quot;. West Wight is predominantly rural, with dramatic coastlines dominated by the chalk downland ridge, running across the whole island and ending in The Needles stacks—perhaps the most photographed aspect of the Isle of Wight. The South Western quarter is commonly referred to as the Back of the Wight because it has a unique social and historical background. The highest point on the island is St Boniface Down, at 241  m which is a marilyn. { The Needles and } { Alum Bay } The rest of the Island&apos;s landscape also has great diversity, with perhaps the most notable habitats being the soft cliffs and sea ledges, which are spectacular features as well as being very important for wildlife, and are internationally protected. The River Medina flows north into the Solent, whilst the other main river, the River Yar flows roughly north-east, emerging at Bembridge Harbour at the eastern end of the island. Confusingly, there is another entirely separate river at the western end also called the River Yar flowing the short distance from Freshwater Bay to a relatively large estuary at Yarmouth. To distinguish them, they may be referred to as the Eastern and Western Yar. The south coast of the island borders the English Channel. Without man&apos;s intervention the sea might well have split the island into three; at the west end where a bank of pebbles separates Freshwater Bay from the marshy backwaters of the Western Yar east of Freshwater, andat the east end where a thin strip of land separates Sandown Bay from the marshy basin of the Eastern Yar, east of Sandown. Yarmouth itself was effectively an island, with water on all sides and only connected to the rest of the island by a regularly breached neck of land immediately east of the town. It is one of the few places in England where the red squirrel is flourishing, with a stable population ( Brownsea Island is another). Unlike most of England, no grey squirrel s are to be found on the island, [ http://www.iwight.com/living_here/environment/operation_squirrel.asp Operation Squirrel Iwight.com 25 September 2010 ] nor are there any wild deer. Instead, rare and protected species such as the dormouse and many rare bat s can be found. The Glanville Fritillary butterfly&apos;s distribution in the United Kingdom is largely restricted to the edges of the crumbling cliffs of the Isle of Wight. A competition in 2002 named the Pyramidal Orchid as the Isle of Wight&apos;s county flower. [ http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html County flowers Plantlife 25 September 2010 ] The island has one of the most important areas in Europe for dinosaur fossils. The eroding cliffs often reveal previously hidden remains particularly along the region known as the Back of the Wight. [ Climate ] Being one of the most southerly parts of the UK, the Isle of Wight has a milder sub-climate than most other areas, which makes it a popular holiday destination, particularly the resorts in the south east of the island. It also has a longer growing season than most other areas in the UK. The average mean temperature is 13 degrees year round,while in July and August,this goes up to 18 degrees celcius. Some of the coastal towns such as Ventnor,have been described as having microclimates.The Isle of Wight is also sunnier than most parts of the U.K and Western Europe,with average rates of 1800-2100,hours of sunshine a year,beating even areas of Northern Spain. { Isle of Wight Climate Statistics } [ Isle of Wight yes yes 9 9 10 13 16 18 20 21 19 15 12 10 3 3 4 7 9 12 14 14 12 9 6 4 89 61 66 48 56 53 41 56 66 79 84 89 February 2012 ] [ Geology ] { Blackgang Chine circa 1910 } The Isle of Wight is made up of a wide variety of different rock types ranging from Early Cretaceous times (around 127  million years ago) to the middle of the Palaeogene (around 30  million years ago). The northern half of island is mainly made up of Tertiary clays, with the southern half formed of Cretaceous rocks (the Chalk that forms the central east-west downs, as well as Upper and Lower Greensand s and Wealden strata). All the rocks found on the island are sedimentary, made up of mineral grains from previously existing rocks. These are all consolidated to form the rocks that can be seen on the island today, such as limestone, mudstone and sandstone. Rocks on the island are very rich in fossils and many of these can be seen exposed on the beaches as the cliffs erode. Cretaceous rocks on the island, usually red, show that the climate was previously hot and dry. This provided suitable living conditions for dinosaur s. Dinosaur bones and footprints can be seen in and on the rocks exposed around the island&apos;s beaches, especially at Yaverland and Compton Bay. As a result, the isle has been nicknamed Dinosaur Island. Along the northern coast of the island there is a rich source of fossil ised shellfish, crocodiles, turtles and mammal bones. The youngest of these date back to around 30  million years ago. About ten thousand years ago, sea levels began to rise and the great ice sheets of the last Ice Age melted. As sea level rose higher, the Isle of Wight became separated from the mainland. This is thought to have occurred about 7,000 years ago. [ Politics ] [ Politics of the Isle of Wight ] { Flying Cloud &quot; off the Needles, Isle of Wight&apos;&apos;, by } { James E. Buttersworth, 1859–60. } The Isle of Wight is a ceremonial and non-metropolitan county. Since the abolition of its two borough councils in 1995 and the restructuring of the county council as the Isle of Wight Council, it has been a unitary county. It also has a single Member of Parliament, and is by far the most populous constituency in the United Kingdom (more than 50% above the average of English constituencies). As a constituency of the House of Commons, it is traditionally a battleground between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. The current Member Of Parliament Andrew Turner is a Conservative, and his predecessor Dr Peter Brand was a Liberal Democrat. The Isle of Wight Council election of 2009 was a victory for the Conservative Party, which took 24 of the council&apos;s 40 seats. { Isle of Wight Council, 2009. Local election results. } There has been a minor regionalist movement, in the form of the Vectis National Party and Isle of Wight Party, but they attracted little support in elections. [ Main towns ] Newport the main town &amp; the high street [ List of places on the Isle of Wight ] Newport, located in the centre of the island, is the county town of the Isle of Wight and is the island&apos;s main shopping area. Recent developments include a new bus station with retail complex and a new retail park on the outskirts. Located next to the River Medina, Newport Quay was a busy port until the mid 19th century, but has now been mainly converted into art galleries, apartments and other meeting places. Ryde, the island&apos;s largest town with a population of around 30,000, is located in the north east of the island. It is a Victorian town with an 800 metre long pier and 6  km of beaches, attracting many tourists each year. Every year there is a Ryde Carnival in two parts, spread over more than one day: one in the daytime, and one at night with many coloured lights. Ryde is also home to the ice hockey club Isle of Wight Raiders, who play in the English Premier League. Cowes is the location of Cowes Week every year and an international sailing centre. It is also the home of the record-setting sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur. East Cowes is famous for Osborne House, Norris Castle and for being the home from 1929 to 1964 of Saunders-Roe, the historic aircraft, flying boat and hovercraft company. Sandown is another seaside resort, attracting many tourists each year. It is also home to the Isle of Wight Zoo and Dinosaur Isle geological museum, and one of the island&apos;s two 18-hole golf courses. Shanklin just south of Sandown, also attracts tourists, with its sandy beaches, Shanklin Chine and the old village. Ventnor, built on the steep slopes of St Boniface Down on the south coast of the island, leads down to a picturesque bay that attracts many tourists. Recent developments include Ventnor Haven, a small harbour built around a Victorian-style bandstand. { Brading, Isle of Wight } In addition there are smaller towns along the coasts, particularly on the eastern side of the island. There are also a number of smaller villages. Some of these (for example, Godshill ) also attract many tourists. [ Culture ] [ Culture of the Isle of Wight ] [ Language and dialect ] The accent of the Isle of Wight is similar to the traditional dialect of Hampshire, featuring the dropping of some consonant s and an emphasis on longer vowel s. It is similar to the West Country dialects heard in SW England, but less removed in sound [ July 2011 ] from the Estuary English of the SE. As with many other traditional southern English regional dialects and accents, a strong island accent is not now commonly heard, and, as speakers tend to be older, this decline is likely to continue. The island also has its own local and regional words. Some words, including grockle (visitor, tourist – hence grockle-can, tour coach) and nipper/nips (a younger male person), are still commonly used and are shared with neighbouring areas of the mainland; the word somewhen is considered by locals as an acceptable alternative to the adverb sometime. A few are unique to the island, for example overner (a mainlander who has settled on the island) and caulkhead (someone born on the island and born from long-established island stock). Other words are more obscure and now used mainly for comic emphasis, such as mallishag (meaning &quot; caterpillar &quot; ) and nammit ( &quot; no meat &quot;, from the lunch of bread and cheese farm workers ate). Some other words are gurt meaning &quot; great &quot; (as in size rather than quality - &quot; Look at en, wi&apos; es gurt &apos;at flappin&apos; abate. &quot; Look at him, with his big hat flapping around), and gallybagger ( &quot; scarecrow &quot; ). [ Jack Lavers 1988 The Dictionary of the Isle of Wight Dialect Dovecote Press 0-946159-63-7 ] [ Identity ] There has been and still is some confusion between the identities of the Isle of Wight as a separate county and, as it once was, a part of the nearby county of Hampshire. At least one mainstream newspaper article as recently as 2008 refers to the &quot; Isle of Wight in Hampshire &quot;.

With the formation of the Isle of Wight County Council in 1890, the distinct identity became officially established: see also Politics of the Isle of Wight.

It is an undulating course with a total climb of 459 metres. [ Speedway ] The island is home to the Isle of Wight Islanders speedway team, who compete in the sport&apos;s third division, the National League. The club was founded in 1996, with a first-night attendance of 1,740. Ice Hockey The island is also home to the Wightlink Raiders, an ice hockey team based at Ryde Arena. They compete in the 1st Tier of the English National Ice Hockey League, the 3rd Division in the country. There is also an amateur team the Vectis Tigers of the 2nd Tier English National Ice Hockey League, and four youth teams including the Isle of Wight Wildcats, all based at Ryde Arena. [ Hockey ] The Isle of Wight Hockey Club run three senior teams and a junior side, with the 1st XI competing in Hampshire&apos;s top division, just one below the regional leagues. The island also has a ladies team—the Vectis Ladies—which is a separate organisation from the IW Hockey Club.

Traditional agricultural commodities are more difficult to market off the island because of transport costs, but island farmers have managed successfully to exploit some specialist markets. The high price of these products overcomes the transport costs. One of the most successful agricultural sectors at present is the growing of crops under cover, particularly salad crops, including tomatoes and cucumbers. The Isle of Wight has a longer growing season than much of the United Kingdom and this also favours such crops. Garlic has been successfully grown in Newchurch for many years, and is even exported to France. This has led to the establishment of an annual Garlic Festival at Newchurch, which is one of the largest events of the island&apos;s annual calendar. The favourable climate has led to the success of vineyard s, including one of the oldest in the British Isles, at Adgestone near Sandown.

There were nearly one-hundred and fifty dairy producers of various sizes in the mid-eighties, but this has now dwindled down to just twenty-four. Due to modern farming practices, the Island has noted increased levels of pesticide poisoning in local farmers and other local residents living near crops and vineyards.

Cowes is still home to various small marine-related companies such as boat-builders. Although they have reduced the extent of the plants and workforce, including the sale of the main site, GKN operates what was once the British Hovercraft Corporation a subsidiary of, and known latterly, when manufacturing focus changed, as Westland Aircraft. Prior to its purchase by Westland, it was the independent company known as Saunders-Roe. It remains one of the most notable historic firms, having produced many of the flying boats, and the world&apos;s first hovercraft. The island&apos;s major manufacturing activity today is in composite material s, used by boat-builders and the wind turbine manufacturer Vestas, which has a wind turbine blade factory and testing facilities in Newport and East Cowes.

[ Services ] [ Tourism and heritage ] The heritage of the island is a major asset, which has for many years kept its economy going. Holidays focused on natural heritage, including both wildlife and geology, are becoming a growing alternative to the traditional British seaside holiday, which went into decline in the second half of the 20th century, due to the increased affordability of air travel to alternative destinations. { Blackgang } Tourism is still the largest industry on the island. In 1999, the 130,000 island residents were host to 2.7  million visitors. Of these, 1.5  million stayed overnight, and 1.2  million visits were day visits. Only 150,000 of these visitors were international visitors. Between 1993 and 2000, visits increased at a rate of 3% per year, on average. [ http://www.investwight.com/useful-info.asp#population A website with Isle of Wight statistics for investors Investwight.com 25 September 2010 ] At the turn of the nineteenth century the island had ten pleasure piers including two at Ryde and a &quot; chain pier &quot; at Seaview. The Victoria Pier in Cowes succeeded the earlier Royal Pier but was itself removed in 1960. The piers at Ryde, Seaview, Sandown, Shanklin and Ventnor originally served a coastal steamer service that operated from Southsea on the mainland. The piers at Seaview, Shanklin, Ventnor and Alum Bay were all destroyed by storms during the last century. Today only the railway pier at Ryde and the piers at Sandown, Totland Bay (currently closed to the public) and Yarmouth survive. Blackgang Chine is arguably the oldest theme park in the UK, and one of the oldest in the world. As well as more traditional tourist attractions, the island is often host to walking holidays [ http://www.wight-walks.co.uk Isle of Wight walking holidays Wight Walks 25 September 2010 ] or cycling holidays through the attractive scenery. Almost every town and village on the island plays host to hotels, hostels and camping sites. Out of the peak summer season, the island is still an important destination for coach tours from other parts of the United Kingdom and an annual walking festival { http://www.isleofwightwalkingfestival.co.uk/ } has attracted considerable interest. The 108  km Isle of Wight Coastal Path follows the coastline as far as possible, deviating onto roads where the route is impassable closer to the sea. A major contribution to the local economy comes from sailing and marine-related tourism. Summer Camp at Camp Beaumont is an attraction at the old Bembridge School site. [ Transport ] [ Transport on the Isle of Wight ] One of the Wightlink FastCats which provide a high-speed ferry service between Portsmouth and Ryde A Southern Vectis bus at Newport Bus Interchange The Isle of Wight has a total of 787  km of roadway. Major roads run between the main island towns, with smaller roads connecting villages. It is one of the few counties in the UK not to have a motorway, although there is a dual carriageway from Coppins Bridge in Newport towards the north of Newport near the island&apos;s hospital and prison. A comprehensive bus network operated by Southern Vectis links most island settlements, with Newport as the central hub. The island&apos;s location 8  km off the mainland means that longer-distance transport is by boat. Car ferry and passenger services are run by Wightlink and Red Funnel as well as a hovercraft operated by Hovertravel. Fixed links, in the forms of tunnels or bridges, have been proposed. The island formerly had its own railway network of over 88  km, but only one line remains in regular use. The Island Line is part of the United Kingdom&apos;s National Rail network, running a little under 14 kilometres from Ryde to Shanklin. The line was opened by the Isle of Wight Railway in 1864, and from 1996 to 2007 was run by the smallest train operating company on the network, Island Line Trains. It is notable for utilising ex-London Underground rolling stock. Branching off the Island Line at Smallbrook Junction is the heritage Isle of Wight Steam Railway, which runs for 5.5 miles to the outskirts of Wootton. There are currently two airfields for general aviation, Isle of Wight Airport at Sandown and Bembridge Airport. The island has over 322  km of cycleways, much of which can be enjoyed by families off road.

It discusses local issues and is published each Friday, or the previous working day if the Friday is a public holiday. The island has one local commercial radio station and also falls within the coverage area of a number of local stations on the near mainland. Isle of Wight Radio has broadcast in the medium-wave band since 1990 and on 102 and 107  MHz FM since 1998, as well as streaming on the internet. The island&apos;s not-for-profit community radio station opened in 2007, Angel Radio began broadcasting on 91.5  MHz from studios in Cowes and a transmitter near Newport. [ http://angelradioisleofwight.moonfruit.com/ &quot; History of Our Station &quot; and &quot; Gallery &quot; 28 October 2007 Flash Angel Radio Isle of Wight Website ] On 1 February 2009, Wight FM began broadcasting as an internet radio station.

[ http://www.iwchronicle.co.uk/ The Isle of Wight Chronicle Iwchronicle.co.uk 2011-12-05 2012-03-15 ] The Chronicle was originally a best selling island paper in the 1950s.

The Isle of Wight is part of the BBC South region and the ITV Meridian region. [ Prisons ] The geography of the island, and its location near the densely populated south of England, led to it hosting three prisons: Albany, Camp Hill and Parkhurst, all located outside Newport near the main road to Cowes. Albany and Parkhurst were among the few Category A prisons in the UK until they were downgraded in the 1990s. The downgrading of Parkhurst was precipitated by a major escape: three prisoners (two murderers and a blackmailer) made their way out of the prison on 3 January 1995 for four days of freedom before being recaptured. Parkhurst especially enjoyed notoriety as one of the toughest jails in the United Kingdom and housed many notable inmates, including the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, New Zealand drug lord Terry Clark and the Kray twins. Camp Hill is located to the west of, and adjacent to, Albany and Parkhurst, on the very edge of Parkhurst Forest, having been converted first to a borstal and later to a Category C prison. It was built on the site of an army camp (both Albany and Parkhurst were barracks); there is a small estate of tree-lined roads with well-proportioned officers&apos; quarters (of varying grandeur according to rank, but now privately owned) to the south and east. The management of all three prisons was merged into a single administration, under the name of HMP Isle of Wight in April 2009. [ Education ] [ Education on the Isle of Wight ] There are sixty-nine Local Education Authority -maintained schools on the Isle of Wight, and two independent school s. As a rural community, many of these schools are small, with average numbers of pupils lower than in many urban areas. There are currently primary schools, middle schools and high schools. However, education reforms have led to plans for closures (for full details on these see Education reforms on the Isle of Wight ). There is also the Isle of Wight College, which is located on the outskirts of Newport. From September 2010, there is a transition period from the &quot; 3-tier system &quot; of primary, middle and high schools. Some schools have now closed their doors, such as Chale CE Primary School. Other schools have become &quot; federated &quot;, such as Brading CE Primary School and St Helens Primary School. Christ the King College started as a &quot; middle school &quot; but is being converted into a High School so that eventually it will have a Sixth Form. From September 2011, there will be 5 new schools, with an age range of 11 to 18 years, which will replace the existing High schools. When the transition is complete, there will be fewer schools on the Isle of Wight.
