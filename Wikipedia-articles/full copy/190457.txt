He served as the 22nd Premier of Quebec in two different mandates, first from May 12, 1970, to November 25, 1976, and then from December 12, 1985, to January 11, 1994, serving a total of just under 15 years as Provincial Premier. [ Early years and education ] Bourassa was born to a working class family in Montreal, the son of Adrienne (née Courville) and Aubert Bourassa, a port authority worker. [ bourassa-robert-2231 ] Robert Bourassa graduated from the Université de Montréal law school in 1956 and was admitted to the Barreau du Québec the following year. On August 23, 1958, he married Andrée Simard, an heiress of the powerful shipbuilding Simard family of Sorel, Quebec. Later, he studied at the University of Oxford and also obtained a degree in political economy at Harvard University in 1960. On his return to Quebec, he was employed at the federal Department of National Revenue as a fiscal adviser. He also worked as a professor of public finance at Université de Montréal and Université Laval. [ Political life ] [ First term as Premier ] Bourassa was first elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec (MLA) for the riding of Mercier in 1966, then won the Quebec Liberal Party leadership election on January 17, 1970. He positioned himself as a young, competent, administrator. He chose &quot; 100  000 jobs &quot; as his slogan, which emphasized that jobs creation would be his priority. Bourassa felt the extensive hydro-electric resources of Quebec were the most effective means of completing the modernization of Quebec and sustaining job creation. He successfully led his party into government in the 1970 election, defeating the conservative Union Nationale government { Downey, Donn. Former premier fought for Quebec, A14. The } { Globe &amp; Mail, October 3, 1996. } and becoming the youngest premier in Quebec history. One of Bourassa&apos;s first crises as premier was the October Crisis of 1970, in which his labour minister, Pierre Laporte, was kidnapped and murdered. Bourassa requested that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoke the War Measures Act. Bourassa and Trudeau often clashed over issues of federal-provincial relations and Quebec nationalism, with Trudeau opposing what he saw as concessions to sovereignism. In 1971 he participated in an attempt at constitutional reform, the Victoria Charter, which quickly unravelled when Bourassa backed away from the proposed deal after it was strongly criticized by Quebec opinion leaders for not giving Quebec more powers. During his time in power, Bourassa implemented policies aimed at protecting the status of the French language in Quebec. In 1974, he introduced Bill 22. However, this legislation was soon superseded by the Charter of the French Language also known as Bill 101, introduced by the Parti Québécois government that replaced him in 1976. By making French the official language of Quebec, Quebec was no longer institutionally bilingual (English and French). Many businesses and professionals were unable to operate under such requirements. Bill 22 angered Anglophones while not going far enough for many Francophones; Bourassa was vilified by both groups and lost the 1976 election in a landslide. Bourassa initiated the James Bay hydroelectric project in 1971 that led to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of 1975 with the Cree and Inuit inhabitants of the region. The Bourassa government also played a major role in rescuing the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal from the huge cost overruns and construction delays. Bourassa&apos;s government became embroiled in corruption scandals that led to his 1976 defeat. Bourassa lost the 1976 provincial election to René Lévesque, leader of the separatist Parti Québécois. Bourassa resigned as Liberal Party leader, and accepted teaching positions in Europe and the United States. He remained in political exile until he returned to politics by winning the Quebec Liberal Party leadership election on October 15, 1983. On June 3, 1985 he won a by-election in Bertrand. [ Second term as Premier ] Bourassa regained the office of premier in the 1985 election. However, he lost his own seat to the Parti Québécois candidate Jean-Guy Parent. On January 20, 1986, he was elected in a by-election in the Liberal stronghold of Saint-Laurent after the sitting Liberal MNA Germain Leduc resigned to vacate it. During his second term as premier of the province, Bourassa invoked the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to override a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that declared parts of the Charter of the French Language unconstitutional, causing some English-speaking ministers in his government to resign. A few years later, however, he introduced modifications to the language charter. These compromises reduced the controversy over language that had been a dominant feature of Quebec politics over the previous decades. Bourassa also pushed for Quebec to be acknowledged in the Canadian constitution as a &quot; distinct society &quot;, promising Quebec residents that their grievances could be resolved within Canada with a new constitutional deal. He worked closely with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and received many concessions from the federal government, culminating in the Meech Lake Accord in 1987 and the Charlottetown Accord in 1992. The Meech Lake Accord failed in June 1990 when two provinces, Manitoba and Newfoundland, refused to ratify the agreement their premiers had signed. The Charlottetown Accord was defeated in a nationwide plebiscite in 1992. That failure revived the Quebec separatist movement. [ Final years ] Bourassa retired from politics in 1994. He was replaced as Liberal leader and premier by Daniel Johnson, Jr., who lost an election to the sovereignist Parti Québécois after only nine months. In 1996, Bourassa died in Montreal of malignant melanoma [ http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm%3DTCE%26amp%3BParams%3DM1ARTM0011010 Bourassa, Robert (Obituary) 2007-09-14 Came Barry Brenda Branswell 1996-10-14 The Canadian Encyclopedia (article reprinted from Maclean&apos;s Magazine ) Historica Foundation ] at the age of 63, and was interred at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

[ Parc Avenue controversy ] On October 18, 2006 Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay announced that Montreal&apos;s Parc Avenue would be named after Bourassa.

This would have caused the newly named street to intersect René-Lévesque Boulevard, named after a long time political rival to Bourassa. That boulevard, in turn, had been renamed from Dorchester Boulevard in 1987, in a decision that was also not without controversy.
