These, in turn, encompass the principles of the American Founding and the college&apos;s academic emphasis on such, especially in relation to its own founding. Hillsdale is among the few non-military colleges in the United States that require every student, regardless of major, to study the U.S. Constitution as a core requirement. { http://kirbycenter.hillsdale.edu/page.aspx?pid=555 } Additionally, prominent conservative theorist Russell Kirk had a substantial career there, and allowed Hillsdale to inherit many of his original writings. { http://www.hillsdale.edu/academics/majors/amstudies/kirk.asp } The college houses and displays the personal library of Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises as well. { http://www.hillsdale.edu/library/collections.html } Hillsdale College is increasingly well-regarded within similar political and economic spheres around the world.

In 1853, the college moved to Hillsdale, Michigan and assumed its current name. Hillsdale was the first American college to prohibit in its charter all discrimination based on race, religion, or sex. Hillsdale&apos;s founders were determined to uphold the principle of equality articulated by the Founders of America who had declared in 1776 that &quot; all men are created equal. &quot; Hillsdale was founded by Freewill Baptists, and in the nineteenth century Hillsdale and Bates College in Maine were the only American colleges affiliated with the denomination. Hillsdale no longer has any denominational affiliation, and Hillsdale Free Will Baptist College in Oklahoma was founded after Hillsdale College disaffiliated itself with the denomination. Shortly after its founding, Hillsdale, as a part of the anti-slavery Freewill Baptist denomination, emerged as an early agitator for the abolition of slavery and for the education of black students. [ A short history of the Baptists Vedder Henry Clay 1897 American Baptist Publication Society 273 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DgcISAAAAYAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA273 2010-12-23 ] Black students were admitted immediately after the college&apos;s 1844 founding, and the College became the second school in the nation to grant four-year liberal arts degrees to women.

A higher percentage of Hillsdale students enlisted than from any other non-military college.

During the conflict, four Hillsdale students received the Medal of Honor, three became generals, and many more served as regimental commanders. For the more than sixty that died, a monument was erected in their honor, which now stands between Kendall and Lane Halls. [ Non-discrimination policy ] Hillsdale&apos;s non-discrimination policy remained controversial throughout its history. For example, Hillsdale&apos;s football team refused to play in the 1956 Tangerine Bowl in Florida when the governing committee of the Bowl would not allow the team&apos;s black players to join the white players on the field; the committee then selected Juniata College instead.

Because some students were receiving federal loans, the federal government asserted that it could require Hillsdale College to submit Assurance of Compliance forms mandated by Title IX as a condition of the continued receipt of federal financial assistance by two hundred Hillsdale students. Hillsdale refused compliance on the grounds that its own policies were less discriminatory than those the federal government would impose. This ongoing dispute with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) began to intensify in 1979 when the College filed a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, asking the court to overturn a previous decision by the Reviewing Authority, Office of Civil Rights of HEW. In December 1982, the Sixth Circuit upheld Hillsdale&apos;s refusal to sign the compliance forms but also ruled that government aid to individual students could be terminated without a finding that a college actually discriminated. Aerial view of Lane Hall and South Quad Delp Hall and the Liberty Walk, facing Central Hall In February 1984, in a related case, Grove City College v. Bell, the Supreme Court required every college or university to fulfill federal requirements - past and future requirements - if its students received federal aid. As a result of the court&apos;s decision, Hillsdale withdrew from all federal assistance beginning with the 1984-85 academic year; Grove City College, the defendant in that case, followed Hillsdale&apos;s lead four years later. Beginning with the 2007-2008 academic year, Hillsdale also stopped accepting Michigan state assistance, instead matching any funds that a student would have received from the state with its own aid. [ Hillsdale rejects Michigan grants The Detroit News 2007-08-14 ] Since 2007, Hillsdale&apos;s entire operating budget of the college, including scholarships, comes from private funding and endowments. Hillsdale&apos;s feud with the federal government is ongoing; in its 2010 &quot; Resolution Against Federal Interference, &quot; it accuses both Congress and the Obama administration of appearing, &quot; even more than the worst of their predecessors, bent on extending federal control over American higher education and other areas of American life. &quot; { http://www.hillsdale.edu/images/userImages/whadra/Page_7027/ResolutionTrustees5-10.pdf } [ Recent history ] Today, Hillsdale College is endorsed on talk radio and in close-knit conservative and libertarian circles, as well as by organizations such as Young Americans for Freedom { http://www.yaf.org/hillsdale10.aspx } and the Heritage Foundation. { http://blog.heritage.org/2010/09/27/the-new-constitutional-kid-on-the-block/ } Since 1981, Hillsdale has presented National Leadership Seminars nationwide on issues of politics, economics and culture.

A letter to the editor signed by sixteen faculty members questioned the appropriateness of legal action in this dispute. One of the three faculty members who had prepared the letter, history professor Warren Treadgold, was informed afterwards that his probationary appointment would not be renewed. A subsequent investigation by a committee of the American Association of University Professors concluded that Hillsdale had violated the Association&apos;s standards in the context of the nonreappointment and found evidence that the administration had made that decision because of Treadgold&apos;s role in preparing the letter, even though this activity &quot; should have been protected under generally accepted principles of academic freedom. &quot; [ http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/33C5D1F1-2928-4A4A-96D0-A7D5D554745D/0/hillsdale.pdf Academic Freedom and Tenure: Hillsdale College, Michigan 2010-12-23 ] Hillsdale&apos;s campus includes Hillsdale Academy, a private K-12 liberal arts school.

Through this initiative, the College will support the launch of K-12 charter schools. These schools will be based on a classical liberal arts model and have a strong civics component that will &quot; equip students to understand and defend the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. &quot; { http://www.hillsdale.edu/seminars/charterschool.asp } According to the college&apos;s website, &quot; Reform of American public education, to be successful and good, must be built on a foundation of classical liberal arts learning—the kind of learning best suited to a free society and most needed for its preservation. The Barney Charter School Initiative is an important step in that direction. To advance the founding of classical charter schools, Hillsdale College is continually seeking groups of parents and local citizens who care deeply about education, who plan to apply or are in the process of applying for a charter, and who are interested in an association with Hillsdale. As groups are identified, Hillsdale will provide assistance to the formation of these schools’ academic programs. Drawing upon the experience of faculty members who have led classical schools, an education department uniquely devoted to classical liberal arts learning, and the College’s relationship with outstanding charter schools nationwide through its Center for Teacher Excellence, these new schools will promote a liberal and civic education in America’s public schools. &quot; [ Graduate School of Statesmanship ] In early 2011, Hillsdale received official accreditation to establish a graduate program, to be called its &quot; Graduate School of Statesmanship. &quot; According to the college, the program will be &quot; a first-principles approach to graduate education in political philosophy and American politics offering the Ph.D. and M.A. in Politics, &quot; and will place emphasis on &quot; both the theory and the practice of government. &quot; Courses are set to begin in the fall of 2012. { http://www.hillsdale.edu/academics/graduate.asp } Hillsdale College in the fall [ College presidents ] [ Early presidents ] Daniel McBride Graham was the college&apos;s first president, serving from 1844 to 1848 and later serving a second term from 1871 to 1874.

Zion, which was used as a retreat for orations, marshmallow roasts, and scenic inspiration. Dr. Bertram A. Barber, a professor in the Biology Department at Hillsdale College, envisioned creating a functional Arboretum on the site as an outdoor laboratory and field station for students and as a biological garden for the community. Additional land soon followed, and by 1924, Dr. Barber’s dream of an Arboretum was fulfilled through donated plants and the labor of Hillsdale students and volunteers.

Proudly our tower and ivied walls point to an azure sky. And may that spirit long remain, bringing distinction true. Noble pride in our Hillsdale’s name endures ’neath the white and blue. Here we for greater knowledge strive, here lasting friends acquire. Here may we keep our dreams alive, as we to heights aspire. Here may our youth a challenge meet, building our hopes anew. Faith in life becomes complete ’neath banners of white and blue. [ Notable alumni ] Bion J. Arnold Jared Maurice Arter Chris Chocola Elizebeth Friedman Washington Gardner Moses A.
