He was a minister in the government of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan (who was married to his aunt), but is best known for opening Chatsworth House to the public. [ Life ] Cavendish was born to Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire and his wife Mary. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. In World War II, he was a major in the Coldstream Guards. He was awarded the Military Cross for his actions on 27 July 1944 when his company was cut off for 36 hours in heavy combat near Strada in Italy. [ Family ] In 1941 he married the Hon. Deborah Mitford (born 31 March 1920), one of the Mitford sisters. The marriage was not without some bumps. Two of the couple&apos;s children died soon after birth, and the Duke&apos;s extramarital affairs became public after he appeared as a witness at a burglary trial and was forced to admit, under oath, that he was on holiday with one of a series of younger women when the crime occurred at his London home. The Duke, however, claimed that much of his marriage&apos;s success was due to the Duchess&apos;s tolerance and broadmindedness. Deborah, as chatelaine, is largely responsible for the success of Chatsworth as a commercial endeavour. [ November 2011 ] He and his wife had six children, three of whom died in infancy: { Deborah Mitford, Duchess of Devonshire, Wait for Me! (Farrar Straus Giroux, 2010), pages 128-132 } The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire had three surviving children: a son, Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire, and two daughters, Ladies Emma Cavendish and Sophia Topley. Among their grandchildren is the fashion model Stella Tennant. The Duke is buried in the churchyard of the village church in Edensor in the grounds of Chatsworth.

With William&apos;s death, Andrew became heir and received the courtesy title of Marquess of Hartington, which he held from 1944 until 1950. The 10th Duke died of a heart attack while visiting Eastbourne in November 1950 and Cavendish inherited the title, though he was in Australia at the time. { Pamela V. Cullen A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams, London, Elliott &amp; Thompson, 2006, ISBN 1-904027-19-9 } The Duke died while being attended by suspected serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams, who was his doctor when visiting Eastbourne. No proper police investigation was ever conducted into the death but Cavendish later said &quot; it should perhaps be noted that this doctor was not appointed to look after the health of my two younger sisters, who were then in their teens &quot;; Adams had a reputation for grooming older patients in order to extract bequests. Cavendish inherited the estate but also an inheritance tax bill of £ 7 million, nearly 80 percent of the value of the estate. In order to meet this, the Duke had to sell off many art objects and antiques, including several Rembrandt s, Van Dyck s and Raffaello Santi s, as well as thousands of acres of land. [ November 2011 ] [ Political career ] Cavendish ran unsuccessfully as a National Liberal candidate for Chesterfield in the 1945 general election and as a Conservative in the same seat in 1950. He was Mayor of Buxton from 1952 to 1954. He served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Commonwealth Relations from 1960 to 1962, Minister of State at the Commonwealth Relations Office from 1962 to 1963, and for Colonial Affairs from 1963 to 1964. He once said that these appointments by his uncle, Harold Macmillan, the then-prime minister, were &quot; the greatest act of nepotism ever &quot;. { Graham Stewart Nepotism on a majestic scale, The Times, 2 February 2008. Accessed 27 March 2008. } He joined the Social Democratic Party shortly after its foundation in 1981, but left the party when David Owen resigned as the party&apos;s leader in 1987, describing Owen as &quot; the best of them &quot;.

His autobiography, Accidents of Fortune, was published just before his death in 2004. The duke had many disputes over the years with the ramblers who used the paths near Chatsworth. Eventually though, in 1991, he signed an agreement with the Peak National Park Authority opening 1,300  acres  (5  km²) of his estate to walkers. He said that everyone was &quot; welcome in my back garden &quot;. The duke&apos;s real estate holdings were vast. In addition to Chatsworth he also owned Lismore Castle in Ireland and Bolton Abbey in North Yorkshire. He also owned the bookshop Heywood Hill and the gentleman&apos;s club Pratt&apos;s. He was a major collector of contemporary British art, known especially for his patronage of Lucian Freud. He was one of the founders, and the chief patron of, the Next Century Foundation in which capacity he hosted the private Chatsworth talks between representatives of the governments of the Arab World and Israel. The duke was listed at number 73 in the Sunday Times Sunday Times Rich List of the richest people in Great Britain in 2004. [ Honours ] In 1996 he was made a Knight of the Garter. [ Other ] He once told interviewer: &quot; Wonderful things have happened in my life — it&apos;s time my son had his turn. When I was young I used to like casinos, fast women and God knows what. Now my idea of Heaven, apart from being at Chatsworth, is to sit in the hall of Brooks&apos;s, having tea. &quot; [ Ancestry ] [ 100% ] [ 1. Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire 2.
