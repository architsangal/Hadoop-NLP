Orange has an estimated population of 39,329 and the city is a major provincial centre. Key industries include agriculture, mining, health services and education. A significant nearby landmark is Mount Canobolas; at an altitude of [ 1395 m ft 0 ] it gives commanding views of the district. Orange is the birthplace of poets Banjo Paterson and Kenneth Slessor, although Paterson lived in Orange for only a very short time as an infant. The first Australian Touring Car Championship, known today as V8 Supercar Championship Series, was held at the Gnoo Blas circuit in 1960.

Percy had employed John Blackman as a guide because he had already accompanied an earlier explorer into that region. In the late 1820s surveyor J. B. Richards worked on a survey of the Macquarie River below Bathurst and also of the road to Wellington. On a plan dated 1829, he indicated a village reserve, in the parish of Orange. Sir Thomas Mitchell named the parish Orange, as he had been an associate of the Prince of Orange in the Peninsular War, when both were aides-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington, whose title was bestowed on the valley westward, by Oxley.

The Australian Women&apos;s Weekly (1932–1982) 1932–1982 13 May 1964 23 February 2011 61 National Library of Australia ] Legal occupation by graziers began late in 1829, and tiny settlements grew up on the properties and in connection with the road. In 1844 surveyor Davidson was sent to check on encroachments onto the land reserved for a village, and to advise on the location for a township; the choice being Frederick&apos;s Valley, Pretty Plains or Blackman&apos;s Swamp. Blackman&apos;s Swamp was decided upon and proclaimed a village and named Orange by Major Thomas Mitchell in 1846 in honour of Prince William of Orange. At nearby Ophir the first payable discovery of gold in Australia was made in 1851 which led to the Australian gold rush. Subsequent discoveries of gold in nearby areas led to the establishment of Orange as a central trading centre for the gold. This is contrary to the popular belief that gold was first discovered close to the nearby regional town of Bathurst. The growth of Orange continued as the conditions were well suited for agriculture, and in 1860 it was proclaimed a municipality. The railway from Sydney reached Orange in 1877. In 1946, 100 years after first being established as a village, Orange was proclaimed a city. [ Industries ] Orange is a well-known fruit growing district, and produces apples, pears, and many stone fruit s such as cherries, peach es, apricot s and plum s; oranges are not grown in the area, as the climate is too cool. In recent years, a large number of vineyard s have been planted in the area for a rapidly expanding wine production industry. The growth of this wine industry, coupled with the further development of Orange as a gourmet food capital, has ensured Orange&apos;s status as a prominent tourism destination. Other large industries include: Cadia gold mine is a large open cut gold and copper mine located about 20 kilometres south of Orange. The mine has been developed throughout the 1990s and is a major employer in the region with an expected lifespan of several decades. Cadia is the second largest open cut mine in Australia after the Super Pit at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Large mineral deposits are also being uncovered from the more recently developed Ridgeway underground mine which is adjacent to the Cadia Mine. An Electrolux white goods factory. Orange is also the location of the New South Wales Department of Industry and Investment (formerly New South Wales Department of Primary Industries ) head office.

Compared with most population centres in Australia it has colder winters, especially in terms of its daytime maximum temperatures, and in summer the average (and absolute) maximum temperatures are also lower than in most inland centres, on account of its elevation. The climate has enabled the area to be a major apple and pear producer, and more recently a centre for cool-weather wine production.

The Orange region is good for grapegrowing and winemaking due to a combination of geology, soils, climate and temperature. Together these factors combine to produce grapes and wine of distinct flavours and colour. The climate perhaps plays the biggest part in giving Orange some distinct natural advantages - the cool temperatures during most of the growing season coupled with dry autumn conditions are ideal for grape growing. { http://www.winesoforange.com.au/ } [ Wineries in Orange ] Angullong Vineyard Belgravia Bloodwood Borrodell on the Mount Brangayne of Orange Canobolas Smith Cargo Road Winery Cumulus Estate De Salis Faisan Estate Hedberg Hill Highland Heritage La Colline Matison Estate Mayfield Vineyard Moody&apos;s Orange Highland Wines and Gardens Orange Mountain Wines Patina Philip Shaw Printhie Ross Hill Stockman&apos;s Ridge Swinging Bridge Word of Mouth Wines Wineries that use Orange region grapes in their wines include Brokenwood (Hunter Valley based), Logan (Mudgee), Tamburlaine (Hunter Valley) and Lowe Wines (Mudgee).

[ Water resources ] Orange has several water sources used for domestic consumption, both currently in use and formerly used. Currently Suma Park Dam and Spring Creek Reservoir are used for domestic water consumption. Two other dams, Lake Canobolas and Gosling Creek Reservoir, were previously used for domestic water consumption however are now used for recreational purposes. Orange was on Level 5 Water restrictions, however after heavy rain increased capacity from around 20% to 100% restrictions were eased back to level 2. Orange City Council is undertaking a number of strategies to supplement its supply, including stormwater harvesting. The first batch of harvested stormwater was released into Suma Park Dam on 21 April 2009. The harvested stormwater was tested by Analytical Laboratory Services, an independent laboratory based in Sydney. ALS tested for 90 potential pollutants. The tests revealed that the water quality met all targets. The first batch contained 14 megalitres. It is believed to be an Australian first for harvesting stormwater for potable use. The hardware is in place, operating rules have been developed and environmental factors and impacts on downstream users have been considered. A three month trial will ensure all these elements are working together to ensure high water quality and environmental standards are met. There are several phases involved in the commissioning period. The hardware, which includes three separate pumping stations, creek flow monitoring points and advanced electronics including fibre optic cables, will undergo further operating tests. The other elements of the scheme include a weir on Blackmans Swamp Creek, which creates a 3 megalitre pool and the site for the first pump station, a 200 megalitre dam and two 17 megalitre batching ponds.The pumps on the creek transfer stormwater to the 200 megalitre dam at a rate of up to 450 litres per second and are designed to rapidly extract peak storm flows from the creek. The operating rules require that a base flow immediately downstream in the creek must be maintained. The creek flow monitoring points ensure these standards are met. The monitoring station also measures when harvesting can commence. The trigger is flows passing the monitor in Blackmans Swamp Creek exceeding 1000 litres per second. The local mine, Cadia Valley Operations, uses the city&apos;s treated effluent to supplement its water supply. [ Transport ] Orange is situated on the Mitchell Highway, linking the city to Molong, Wellington, Dubbo and Bourke to the north west, and to Bathurst to the east and from there to Sydney via the Great Western Highway ( [ 260 km mi -1 / on ] ).
