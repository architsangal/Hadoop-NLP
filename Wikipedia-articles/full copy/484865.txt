Some recipes call for tomato, onion, lime juice, chili, yogurt and/or additional seasonings. [ History ] Guacamole was made by the Aztec s as early as the 16th century. The name comes from an Aztec dialect via Nahuatl āhuacamolli, which literally translates to &quot; avocado sauce &quot;, from āhuacatl (= &quot; avocado &quot; ) + molli (= &quot; sauce &quot; ). In Mexican Spanish it is pronounced [ wakaˈmole ], in American English it is sometimes pronounced [ ɡwɑːkəˈmoʊliː ], and in British English sometimes [ ˌwækəˈmoʊliː ]. Early recipes from the California Avocado Advisory Board (Calavo), published in the 1940s, were accompanied with a pronunciation suggestion: &quot; Say Huakamole &quot;. Later marketing tried to create a &quot; luau &quot; or Pacific Island image of the avocado in the 1960s, and a Spanish or Mediterranean image in the 1970s. Guacamole has pushed avocado sales to 30 million pounds on two days a year, Super Bowl Sunday and Cinco de Mayo.
