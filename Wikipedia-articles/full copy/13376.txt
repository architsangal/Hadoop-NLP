[ May 2010 ] Population of Haiti (in thousands) from 1961 to 2003 Although Haiti averages approximately 255 people per square kilometer (650 per sq. mi.), its population is concentrated most heavily in urban area s, coastal plain s, and valley s. About 80-85% of Haitians are of predominantly West African descent. { CIA - The World Factbook -- Haiti } [ March 2011 ] The remainder of the population is primarily mulatto es. There are tiny Arab, Asian and European communities. Hispanic residents in Haiti are mostly Cuba n and Dominican. About two thirds of the Haitian population live in rural areas. Although there was a national census taken in Haiti in 2003, much of that data has not been released to the public. Several demographic studies, including those by social work researcher Athena Kolbe have shed light on the current status of urban residents. In 2006 households averaged 4.5 members. The median age was 25 years with a mean average age of 27 years. People aged 15 and younger counted for roughly a third of the population. Overall, 52.7 percent of the population was female.

One of the country&apos;s official languages is Haitian Creole, a French-based creole with African influences, as well as minor Spanish and Taíno influences. French is the other official language. Spanish, though not official, is spoken by a growing amount of the population. It is spoken more frequently near the border with the Dominican Republic. English is increasingly spoken among the young and in the business sector. [ Religion ] The state religion is Roman Catholicism which 80-85% of the population professes. 15-20% of Haitians practice Protestantism. A significant percentage of the population also practice Vodou traditions approximately 20-25%, but these claims are denied by a significant amount of the strict [ December 2009 ] Roman Catholic populace. [ December 2009 ] Haitians that do practice both faiths however tend to see no conflict in these African-rooted beliefs co-existing with the Roman Catholic faith. [ December 2009 ] [ Education ] Although public education is free, private and parochial schools provide around 75% of educational programs offered. Less than 65% of children of primary school age are actually enrolled. At the secondary level, the figure drops to 55%. Of those enrolled in primary school, 63% will complete it. On average, it takes 16 years to produce a single graduate of the 6-year cycle. [ December 2009 ] Though Haitians place a high value on education, [ December 2009 ] few can afford to send their children to secondary school. [ December 2009 ] Remittance s sent by Haitians living abroad are important in paying educational costs. [ December 2009 ] In the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, home to 2.21 million of Haiti&apos;s 8.5 million people, only 23 percent of adults have completed secondary school with 16 percent passing the state graduation exam. More than half (53.5 percent) of children aged 5–17 do not attend school. [ Emigration ] Large-scale emigration, principally to the United States, and Canada (predominantly to Quebec, with other areas of the country) - but also to Cuba, other areas of Europe and the Americas such as France (with French Guiana ), Spain, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Ireland; and Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and other Caribbean neighbors - has created what Haitians refer to as the Eleventh Department or the Diaspora. About one of every six Haitians live abroad.
