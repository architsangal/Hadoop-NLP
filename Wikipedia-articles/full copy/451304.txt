As of 128,989, the city had an estimated population of 128,989 and a density of 7,320 persons per km². The total area was 17.58  km².

[ August 2009 ] [ Surrounding municipalities ] Sagamihara Atsugi Yamato Ebina [ History ] The area around Zama has been settled since prehistoric times, and Jomon period remains have been found. The hamlet of &quot; Izama &quot; was a post station on the ancient Tōkaidō road connecting Kyoto with the provinces in the Kantō region, and the area was part of the tenryō territory within Sagami Province during the Edo period administered directly by the Tokugawa shogunate through a number of hatamoto -class administrators. During the cadastral reforms after the Meiji Restoration in 1889, the area of present-day Zama consisted of five villages in Kōza District, Kanagawa Prefecture. The area remained very rural until the coming of the Odakyu Electric Railway in 1927 and the Sagami Railway in 1935, which spurred development, but the area was mostly farmland when the Imperial Japanese Army Academy relocated to the Zama area in 1937. The increase in population led Zama village to be promoted to Zama town the same year. However, in 1941, Zama town and surrounding villages were merged into Sagamihara. In 1944, the Kōza Naval Arsenal of the Imperial Japanese Navy was established in the area. It was closed with the end of World War II, and the Imperial Japanese Army Academy was turned over to the United States Army to become Camp Zama. In September 1948, Zama regained its status as a town independent of Sagamihara. The local economy received a significant boost with the building of a Nissan automobile assembly plant in Zama in 1965. Zama became a city on November 1, 1971. [ Economy ] Zama has a mixed economy.
