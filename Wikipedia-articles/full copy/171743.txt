Originally operating between Victoria and Gatwick as a separate franchise, its services were incorporated into the Southern franchise in 2008, and some Gatwick-Express-branded trains subsequently were extended beyond Gatwick via Haywards Heath to Brighton and Eastbourne, some of which pass non-stop through Gatwick Airport despite the branding. Due to the extension of several of these services, train liveries and signage have increasingly changed to simply &apos;express&apos;. The service was initially introduced as a separate entity under the nationalised British Rail (BR), which brought together several previous schemes to run dedicated services to the airport. The service was operated by BR&apos;s Southern Region, using branding and a livery similar to that used on the Intercity running north, east and west of London. The service was run on a &quot; push-pull &quot; basis using Class 73 electro-diesels and dedicated stock consisting of converted BR Mark 2 coaches and EMU driving cars of Class 489. As a small, self-contained operation, the service became one of the first private train operating company franchises from 1994 as part of the privatisation process of British Rail. The new company ordered units of Class 460. The Department of Transport proposed scrapping the franchise so as to release capacity on the busy Brighton main line, especially during peak periods. However, following objections by several interested parties, including the owners of Gatwick Airport itself, in June 2008 the franchise instead became part of Southern. Higher-capacity rolling stock was introduced in the form of renovated &quot; Wessex Electric &quot; units that had been taken off-lease by South West Trains (SWT), enabling Southern to increase the service by incorporating journeys south of Gatwick, and to use the units on services to Eastbourne. The Class 460 units are to be split up and used to increase capacity on SWT. These moves have been criticised because the Class 460s were purpose-built for the airport service yet were used on it for only 10 years, while the Class 442 trains are older, slower, less reliable, and not designed for dedicated airport link services. [ Junipers United: Darth Vader goes suburban Walmsley, Ian Modern Railways London February 2012 40 Since the inspired DfT decision to replace the purpose-built Gatwick Express airport trains with slow, lumbering Class 442s, the modern and highly reliable Class 460s have been looking for a home. ] [ Service ] The main service runs the 27-mile journey from London Victoria to Gatwick every 15 minutes. The average non-stop journey time is 30 minutes. The firm operates 24 &quot; Wessex Electric &quot; trains on dedicated services to the airport, with one Class 73 Thunderbird locomotive to rescue failed units. Gatwick Express, unlike Heathrow Express, is part of the National Rail network, but does not accept Network Railcard s or Gold Cards for discounts, which Heathrow Express does. An Express Class (standard class) adult single ticket costs £ 18.90, and a return £33.20 (child ticket costs £9.45 and £16.60, respectively). Although when bought in advance online (at http://www.gatwickexpress.com/), prices are discounted (adult: £16.85 single, £27.90 return; child: £8.40 single, £13.95 return). [ http://www.gatwickexpress.com/en/tickets-and-fares/buy-online-and-save/ Fares - Online Discounts - Gatwick Express Southern Railway 14 March 2012 ] These prices are higher than those of the Southern stopping services on the same route (between £13.20 and £13.70 for a standard class, adult single fare, depending on whether the time of travel is peak/off-peak and whether the route is restricted to Southern trains only, or any non-Gatwick Express train). [ http://tickets.southernrailway.com/ Southern Railway ticket finder Southern Railway 14 March 2012 ] This is supposed to reflect the premium frequency and non-stop service that the Gatwick Express offers, despite the fact that the Southern and other local/stopping services are actually just as frequent and take only 1–8 minutes longer than the Gatwick Express. Patient and savvy travellers can actually travel between London Victoria (or other central London National Rail stations) and Gatwick Airport cheapest by using an Oyster card to travel as far as East Croydon, at a cost of £2.80/£4.50 (off-peak/peak), [ http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/tickets/faresandtickets/farefinder/current/default.aspx TfL single fare finder Transport for London 14 March 2012 ] and then to Gatwick Airport via First Capital Connect services at a cost of £5.00 or Southern services at a cost of £5.70 [ http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/planjourney/search National Rail journey finder National Rail 14 March 2012 ] (i.e. total cost £7.80–£10.20). Whilst not non-stop, as one must change trains at East Croydon in order to touch in or out of the Oyster card system, the frequency of trains between East Croydon and Gatwick Airport is such that changeover times are minimal (as little as one minute, although this is probably unfeasible in practice, especially if one has heavy luggage to carry). Trains are often non-stop between Victoria and East Croydon, and between East Croydon and Gatwick Airport, and with each leg taking as little as 15 minutes, a total journey time of under 40 minutes is entirely possible. In addition, tickets for travel via First Capital Connect between Gatwick Airport and East Croydon can, like Gatwick Express tickets, often be purchased in-flight on carriers such as easyJet, thus avoiding queues at the ticket machines in Gatwick Airport South Terminal after landing and clearing security. Historical fares: [ http://www.gatwickexpress.com/en/tickets-and-fares/buy-online-and-save/ Fares - Online Discounts - Gatwick Express Southern Railway 14 March 2012 ] January 2007 - £14.90 July 2007 - £15.90 January 2008 - £16.90 July 2008 - £17.90 March 2009 - £16.90 January 2012 - £18.90 [ History ] The origins of the Gatwick Express service come from the initial opening of Gatwick Airport station in June 1958. Initially the service was provided entirely by London to Brighton stopping services, but more trains began to call with the introduction of the summer timetable in June 1958. One of the key elements of this was the extension of Three Bridges to Bognor Regis stopping services to start and terminate at London Victoria. These trains would run through a reversible platform at Gatwick station where a portion would detach and wait in the platform for passengers until the next up train from Bognor Regis was attached and the train would depart for Victoria. For this service, BR used a small batch of seven 2HAL units in order to work with the trains used on the Bognor services, suitable for airport link use because of their larger luggage space. This situation lasted until the early 1970s, when the increase in use of the airport and luggage was rendering the old system obsolete. BR therefore decided to adapt a number of 4VEP units with increased luggage capacity (at the expense of fewer second-class seats) and were redesignated 4VEG. The service, however, remained much the same, with the units attaching and detaching from Bognor-bound services running via Redhill. This led to somewhat extended journey times which meant the service lacked any real purpose, as the faster services began calling at Gatwick Airport from the early 1970s, and made the option of travelling to Gatwick from London on the service lack appeal to those who knew better. In 1975, the British Airports Authority airport director, John Mulkern, the chairman of British Caledonian Airways, Adam Thomson, and the regional manager of BR&apos;s Southern Region, Bob Reid (latterly Sir Bob Reid), formed the Gatwick Liaison Group to discuss matters of mutual interest. As a subsidiary of this, the Gatwick Promotion Group, under the chairmanship of the airport public relations manager David Hurst, was formed to market the airport. One of the first successes of the group was to persuade the BR board to redevelop Gatwick station by building a raft over the platforms, and this was opened by the BR chairman, Sir Peter Parker, in 1980. It was a long-term aim of the group to have a non-stop service between the airport and central London in order to counter the perceived distance from the capital both to the UK market and to potential passengers at the overseas destinations. { class 73 running one of the original formation Gatwick Express services. } At first the service from Bognor (which by this stage only stopped at East Croydon ) was branded &quot; Rapid City Link &quot;. However, in 1984 the non-stop Gatwick Express service was started with ten units of reconditioned rolling stock with extra luggage space. A 30-minute journey time was advertised although it was recognised that some journeys would take nearer 35 minutes, especially in rush hours. The first unit was taken on a promotional tour of the UK introducing it to travel agents in various centres, thought to be the first time a Southern Region train had travelled north. The original services were formed with Class 73 locomotives and Mk2 coaching stock with specially modified GLV (Goods Luggage Vans) to carry passenger luggage and provide a driving facility at the other end of the train to the locomotive. [ Privatisation ] Original privatisation-era logo from 1994. Gatwick Express was the first portion of British Rail&apos;s InterCity sector to be converted into a separate train operating unit, ready for franchising as a private business. [ The Intercity Story Vincent Mike OPC Railprint April 2004 978-0-86093-524-7 ] The franchise was awarded to National Express Group, and operations began in April 1996. [ Gatwick Express - Our History Gatwick Express 21 February 2010 ] Under the ownership of National Express, the essential nature of the service remained unchanged, but the entire train fleet was replaced with newly-built Class 460 trains. In 2005, a pair of Class 458 units, 458001 and 458002, transferred from South West Trains (SWT)for use as a spare train if a 460 unit is out of action. They remained in SWT livery but with Gatwick Express branding. Their seating was modified from high density 3+2 seating configuration to 2+2 configuration; some seating was removed and replaced with luggage racks. However, these units were never called into service and have returned to operations with SWT. { Class 460 goes through } { East Croydon, showing a good example of the Gatwick Express livery } In 2006, following the introduction of the modern fleet, the final Class 73 service ran an evening service from London Victoria and back to mark the end of the era for these trains. Two examples of the Mk2 coaching stock previously used on the Gatwick Express service can be found at the Nottingham Transport Heritage Centre in Ruddington and a full-length Gatwick Express at the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. The latter train is hauled by a Class 31 diesel locomotive, painted in Gatwick Express livery. From the end of 2004 to 2006, there was controversy surrounding the service with some rail groups believing that Gatwick Express trains, which often run half-full (compared to the severe overcrowding on other services), made poor use of the limited capacity on some of the busiest railway lines in the country. The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) made proposals in the Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Strategy for the Gatwick Express service to be incorporated into existing London-to-Brighton mainline services operated by Southern in an attempt to relieve commuter congestion. The aim was to provide a regular ten-minute interval service from London Victoria to Gatwick and the south coast. This idea was hotly disputed by the train operator as well as BAA, who feared that airport users would have to fight for space on the trains with commuters. In certain situations, such as the 7 July 2005 London bombings, rail emergencies, or other severe disruption, when normal trains to Redhill are/were cancelled, the Gatwick Express has been known to stop there. This is because of Redhill&apos;s unique rail connections to Reading, Wales, Birmingham and Kent. [ Transfer to Southern ] [ section March 2011 ] On 3 February 2006, the Department for Transport Rail Group (DfT), which took over the responsibilities of the SRA in summer 2005, announced that the service would be axed to release capacity on the Brighton Main Line.

[ Branson in Gatwick Express call BBC News 8 January 2007 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6241993.stm 18 February 2007 ] Towards the end of 2006 the DfT embarked on a consultation exercise to examine the situation, offering four possible options - three of which would allow for some form of modified express service to be retained. [ Gatwick Express consultation ends BBC News 22 December 2006 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6202671.stm 18 February 2007 ] A decision was made to keep the Gatwick Express and to expand the service to Brighton at peak times from December 2008. The Gatwick Express franchise ended on 22 June 2008, when the service was transferred to Southern. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6524763.stm Gatwick Express service to remain BBC News 4 April 2007 4 April 2007 ] Initially, services continued unchanged. In December 2008, the Gatwick Express was extended to start at Brighton during the morning peak period, and to terminate there in the evening peak. This doubled the number of London-Brighton express trains during those periods. The extra capacity is provided by leasing a number of Class 442 units that had been withdrawn by SWT. The combined South Central/Gatwick Express franchise ended in September 2009, allowing the new franchise holder (Southern) time to implement the major timetable changes planned for December 2009. [ Agreement signed to amend Gatwick Express and Southern franchises DfT Rail Group DfT http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/passenger/franchises/gatwickexpressandsouthern 27 June 2007 http://web.archive.org/web/20070718210159/http%3A//www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/passenger/franchises/gatwickexpressandsouthern 18 July 2007 ] The Gatwick Express retains its separate branding as part of the new franchise, similar to that of the Stansted Express within the Greater Anglia franchise. In May 2011 the final Class 460 vehicles were returned off lease, since when the service has been operated exclusively by Class 442 trains. [ Ticketing ] London-Gatwick is one of the few journeys on the UK National Rail network for which passengers are required to choose between different operators when buying tickets — on all other flows shared by different National Rail operators tickets for immediate travel are inter-available, although some restrictions may apply on cheaper tickets. Through tickets for which the London-Gatwick line is part of a permitted route are valid on the Gatwick Express, provided they are not endorsed &quot; NOT GATWICK EXPRESS. &quot; Tickets from London to stations south of Gatwick generally bear this restriction. Passengers cannot travel on Gatwick Express using the Network Railcard discount for South East England, unless part of a through ticket to/from beyond Victoria. Southern tickets to Redhill can be used in emergencies, as the train stops there during such times. Historically, standard Gatwick Express services did not charge penalty fare s and permitted tickets to be purchased on board at no extra charge. Journeys to or from stations south of Gatwick were subject to penalty fares as normal.

The Class 442s operate as either single 5-car units or are coupled together to form 10-car trains. In peak hours, these trains run services to Brighton. The trains were recently refurbished for use on the route. The refurbishment included new seats, more seats, new large luggage racks and a new first-class area in what used to be the buffet. The refurbishment also included a repaint into a modified version of the Gatwick Express livery.
