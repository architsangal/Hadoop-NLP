Although the US Census treats Calumet and Norvelt as a single community, they are in reality two very different communities, each reflecting a different chapter in how the Great Depression affected rural Pennsylvanians. Calumet was a typical “patch town,” built by a single company to house its miners as cheaply as possible. The closing of the Calumet mine during the Great Depression caused enormous hardship in an era when unemployment compensation and welfare payments were nonexistent. On the other hand, Norvelt was created during the depression by the US federal government as a model community, intended to increase the standard of living of laid-off coal miners. [ Geography ] Calumet-Norvelt is an unincorporated community within Mount Pleasant Township. Calumet-Norvelt is located at [ 40 12 49 N 79 29 35 W type:city ] (40.213730, -79.493121) [ 1 ]. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of [ 1.5 sqmi km2 ], all of it land. [ History of Calumet ] [ Calumet, Pennsylvania ] Calumet was founded by the Calumet Coke Company in 1888 as a housing site for its workers.

Starry, Jr. 2006-02-25 Virtual Museum of Coal Mining in Western Pennsylvania ] The community, as originally laid out, consisted of twenty double-houses, twelve single-family houses, and a few commercial and industrial buildings. The workers were employed in a coal mine and also tended ovens that produced coke (fuel). In 1894, Calumet was the site of a bitter coal miners’ strike against the H. C. Frick Coke Company, which at that time was part-owner of Calumet Coke Company. The coke works closed in the 1920s, and the mine closed in the early 1930s during the Great Depression, causing enormous hardship for the community’s workers. [ History of Norvelt ] [ Norvelt, Pennsylvania ] Norvelt, originally named Westmoreland Homesteads, was created April 13, 1934, as one of a series of “subsistence homesteads” under the National Industrial Recovery Act.

( Harrisburg, Pennsylvania ) and Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission ] These communities were intended to allow rural inhabitants to have an improved quality of living, while largely growing their own food. It was hoped that these new communities would raise the standard of living for unemployed coal miners from nearby Calumet and similar &quot; patch towns &quot; in the area. Accordingly, each lot was a minimum of [ 1.7 acre m2 ], and other land was set aside as a cooperative farm. The community’s layout and home designs were created by Paul Bartholomew, an architect who had also designed many notable buildings in Greensburg. In 1937, the community’s name was changed to Norvelt (EleaNOR RooseVELT), following a visit by Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
