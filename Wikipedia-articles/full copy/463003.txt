It extends for [ 18.78 mi km 2 ] from the massive Bruckner Interchange in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx to the New York– Connecticut state line at Rye Brook. The parkway continues south from the Bruckner Interchange as the Whitestone Expressway ( Interstate  678 or I-678) and north into Greenwich, Connecticut, as the Merritt Parkway. The roadway is named for English-born American religious leader Anne Hutchinson. Construction of the parkway began in 1924 and was completed in 1941. The portion of the parkway between Eastern Boulevard (now Bruckner Boulevard) in the Bronx and U.S. Route  1 (US  1) in Pelham Manor was designated as New York State Route  1X (NY  1X) from 1941 to 1946. NY  1A was subsequently realigned to follow the Hutch between Eastern Boulevard and US  1. The NY  1A designation was removed [ 1962 ]. [ Route description ] Northbound on the Hutchinson River Parkway in Pelham The Hutchinson River Parkway begins at the Bruckner Interchange in the Bronx, where I-95, I-278, I-295, and I-678 all meet. It heads north, partly following Westchester Creek through the eastern Bronx to Pelham Bay Park, where it meets the Bronx and Pelham Parkway and encounters I-95 just north of the point where it changes from the Bruckner Expressway to the New England Thruway. A bikeway parallels the Parkway from Bruckner Interchange to Pelham Parkway. The Hutch continues on, crossing over the Hutchinson River and passing through Pelham Bay Park before following the river&apos;s east bank into Westchester County and the border village of Pelham Manor, where an exit leads to US  1. It heads north from US  1, following the river through Pelham, Mount Vernon, and Eastchester to New Rochelle, where the river ends amongst three reservoirs in Twin Lakes County Park, near the point where the Hutch intersects the Cross County Parkway. The parkway turns eastward, passing through New Rochelle and Scarsdale and entering Saxon Woods Park, where the Hutchinson Parkway joins the Mamaroneck River at an interchange with Mamaroneck Avenue. The Hutchinson Parkway from Mamaroneck Avenue Both the Hutch and the river continue northeast, passing through the southernmost portion of White Plains on its way to Harrison. Here, the parkway meets I-287 and connects to I-684 by way of a short spur linking the parkway and I-684. Past I-684, the parkway heads easterly and northerly into the town of Rye and the village of Rye Brook, where it connects to NY  120A and becomes the Merritt Parkway at the Connecticut state line. The road is designated as NY  908A within the Bronx and NY  907W within Westchester County. Both designations are unsigned reference route s. Like the Bronx River Parkway, the reference route designation of the parkway in Westchester County violates the numbering scheme used by the New York State Department of Transportation. The second digit of a reference route designation typically indicates its region. While other reference routes in the county carry a second digit of &quot; 8 &quot;, as Westchester County is located in region 8, the &quot; 0 &quot; in 907W is indicative of regions 10 and 11, containing Long Island and New York City, respectively. [ History ] Construction of the parkway began in 1924 and the first two-mile (3  km) section was completed in December 1927. By October 1928, [ 11 mi 0 ] of the parkway were open, connecting US  1 in Pelham Manor with Westchester Avenue in White Plains. The original roadway was an undivided, limited-access parkway, designed with gently sloping curves, stone arch bridges, and wooden lightpost s. The original [ 11 mi 0 on ] section included bridle path s along the right-of-way. There was also a riding academy where the public could rent horse s.

A northward extension of the Hutchinson River Parkway from White Plains to King Street (modern NY  120A ) in Rye Brook on the Connecticut state line was completed in 1937 and a southward extension from Pelham Manor to Pelham Bay Park opened in December 1937. The new southerly extension became part of a rerouted NY  1A. [ Thibodeau William A. The ALA Green Book 1938–39 1938 Automobile Legal Association ] [ New York Info-Map Gulf Oil Company 1940 Rand McNally and Company ] [ New York Esso 1940 General Drafting ] The final segment of the parkway—a southward extension to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge —was completed in 1941 and initially designated NY  1X. The NY  1X designation was removed in 1946 and replaced with a realigned NY  1A, [ Official Highway Map of New York State State of New York Department of Public Works 1947–48 General Drafting ] which had previously followed Bruckner Boulevard and Shore Road between what is now the Bruckner Interchange and exit  5 on the Hutch. [ New York with Pictorial Guide Esso 1942 General Drafting ] The NY  1A designation was completely removed [ 1962 ]. [ New York and Metropolitan New York Sunoco H.M. Gousha Company 1961 1961–62 ] [ New York with Sight-Seeing Guide Esso General Drafting 1962 ] Originally, the parkway was built and designated all the way to the Bronx –Whitestone Bridge. However, the original parkway designs did not allow for commercial traffic. When the bridge was designated I-678, the section between the Bruckner Interchange and the Bronx Whitestone Bridge had to be converted to Interstate Highway standards. Once that was completed, that section was assigned the I-678 designation and renamed part of the Whitestone Expressway. [ September 2007 ] Modifications in 1984 included straightening of some curves, increased sight distance s, removal of the rustic lightposts, and lengthening of acceleration and deceleration lanes. Originally, there was a 25¢ toll located in Pelham between exits  7 and  8. The toll was removed on October  31, 1994, as part of a major reconstruction project. [ http://www.nycroads.com/roads/hutchinson/ Hutchinson River Parkway Steve Anderson NYCRoads September 2, 2007 ] The claim has been made, most notably in Robert Caro &apos;s biography, The Power Broker, that Moses deliberately designed the parkways to have low bridges to prevent low-income families from traveling by bus to destinations outside of New York City. [ DeWan George The Master Builder: How planner Robert Moses transformed Long Island for the 20th Century and beyond Newsday New York City May 3, 1998 A12 Although he denied it, the bridges on the parkways had been built too low to accommodate buses so that poor people without cars, especially minorities, could not get to parks and beaches. Caro said that he was told this privately by one of Moses&apos; right-hand men, Sid Shapiro, who later himself became head of the park commission. ] [ Exit list ] [ https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/Traffic%20Data%20Report%202008.pdf 2008 Traffic Data Report for New York State June 16, 2009 PDF 336 New York State Department of Transportation November 17, 2009 ] [ NY I 678 Hutchinson River Expressway ] { Continuation beyond the Bruckner Interchange } [ NY I 95 I 278 Cross Bronx Expressway Bruckner Expressway ] { via } { Bruckner Boulevard } { Bruckner Interchange } [ exit 2 East Tremont Avenue  / Westchester Avenue ] [ NY Parkway Pelham ] [ NY I 95 New England Thruway south ] { Southbound exit only } [ exit 4B Baychester Avenue Southbound exit only ] [ exit 3.35 5 Orchard Beach Road ] [ NY I 95 New England Thruway north ] { Northbound exit only } [ NY US 1 Boston Post Road ] [ exit 8 Sandford Boulevard Southbound exit and entrance ] [ exit Pelham 2 village 5.47 9 Wolfs Lane Northbound exit and entrance ] [ exit 10 East Third Street Southbound exit only ] [ exit Pelham – Mount Vernon village/city line 3 6.39 12 East Lincoln Avenue  – Mount Vernon, Pelham ] [ NY Parkway Cross County ] { Northbound exit and southbound entrance } [ exit 7.21 14 Pelhamdale Avenue  / New Rochelle Road ] [ NY Parkway Cross County ] { Southbound exit and northbound entrance } [ exit New Rochelle 4 16 Webster Avenue No southbound exit ] [ exit 9.21 17 North Avenue Northbound exit and entrance ] [ exit 18 Mill Road Southbound exit and entrance ] [ exit 19 Wilmot Road Southbound exit and northbound entrance ] [ NY NY 125 Weaver Street ] { Southbound exit and entrance } [ NY NY 125 Weaver Street ] { Northbound exit and entrance } [ exit Scarsdale 12.25 22 Mamaroneck Road ] [ exit White Plains– Harrison city/village line 2 13.19 23 Mamaroneck Avenue Signed as 23S (south) and 23N (north) ] [ NY NY 127 North Street ] [ NY I 287 Cross-Westchester Expressway ] { Signed as 26E (east) and 26W (west) } [ NY I 684 north ] { Northbound exit and southbound entrance } [ NY NY 120 Purchase Street ] [ exit 17.43 28 Lincoln Avenue ] [ exit Rye Brook 3 18.15 29 North Ridge Street ] [ NY NY 120A King Street ] { Signed as exit 27S on southbound parkway } [ CT CT 15 Merritt ] { Continuation into } { Connecticut } [ exit ] [ See also ] [ New York Roads ] [ References ] [ 2 ] [ External links ] [ hutch hutch ] Category:New Rochelle, New York Category:Parkways in New York City Category:Transportation in the Bronx Category:Transportation in Westchester County, New York Category:Robert Moses projects es:Hutchinson River Parkway
