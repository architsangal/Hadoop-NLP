{ Battle of Sedgemoor memorial } The Monmouth Rebellion,The Revolt of the West or The West Country rebellion of 1685, was an attempt to overthrow James II, who had become King of England, King of Scots and King of Ireland at the death of his elder brother Charles II on 6 February 1685. James II was a Roman Catholic, and some Protestants under his rule opposed his kingship. James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, an illegitimate son of Charles II, claimed to be rightful heir to the throne and attempted to displace James II. The rebellion ended with the defeat of Monmouth&apos;s forces at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685. Monmouth was executed for treason on 15 July, and many of his supporters were executed or transported in the &quot; Bloody Assizes &quot; of Judge Jeffreys. [ Duke of Monmouth ] { James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth } [ James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth ] Monmouth was an illegitimate son of Charles II. There had been rumours that Charles had married Monmouth&apos;s mother, Lucy Walter, [ Fraser, Antonia Antonia Fraser 1979 King Charles II Weidenfeld and Nicolson London 0-297-77571-5 ] but no evidence was forthcoming, { Robin Clifton, ‘Walter, Lucy (1630?–1658)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 } and Charles always said that he only had one wife, Catherine of Braganza. [ Hutton, Ronald Ronald Hutton 1989 Charles II: King of England, Scotland, and Ireland Clarendon Press Oxford (England) 0-19-822911-9 ] That marriage produced no surviving children. Monmouth was a Protestant. He had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the English Army by his father in 1672 and Captain-General in 1678, enjoying some successes in the Netherlands in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. An attempt was made in 1681 to pass the Exclusion Bill, an Act of Parliament to exclude James Stuart, Charles II&apos;s brother, from the succession and substitute Monmouth, but Charles outmanoeuvred his opponents and dissolved Parliament for the final time. { Harris, Tim, Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685–1720, Penguin Books, Ltd., 2006.

The accession of James II put an end to these hopes. Prince William of Orange, although also a Protestant, was bound to James by treaties and could not accommodate a rival claimant. [ From Lyme Regis to Sedgemoor ] In May 1685, Monmouth set sail for South West England, a strongly Protestant region, with three small ships, four light field guns and 1500 muskets.

However, he found the city had been occupied by Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort, and the men of the Gloucester Militia. There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham (an elderly nephew of Turenne, who had spent some time in English service and later became a Knight of the Garter ). Monmouth then moved towards Bath, which had also been occupied by Royalist troops, He camped in Philips Norton (now Norton St Philip ), where his forces were attacked on the 27th June by Feversham&apos;s forces. Monmouth then marched overnight to Frome, heading for Warminster. Monmouth was counting on a rebellion in Scotland, led by Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll, [ http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/stuart-rebellions/campainview.asp?CampainId%3D3 Monmouth&apos;s Rebellion UK Battlefields Resource Centre 2008-06-14 ] weakening the King&apos;s support and army. Argyll landed at Campbeltown on 20 May and spent some days raising a small army of supporters, but was unable to hold them together while marching through the lowlands towards Glasgow. Argyll and his few remaining companions were captured at Inchinnan on 19 June, and he was taken to Edinburgh, where he was executed on 30 June. Expected rebellions in Cheshire and East Anglia also failed to materialise. The morale of Monmouth&apos;s forces started to collapse as news of the setback in Scotland arrived on 28 June, while the makeshift army was camped in Frome. The rebels got as far as Trowbridge, but royalist forces cut off the route and Monmouth turned back towards Somerset through Shepton Mallet, arriving in Wells on 1 July. The soldiers damaged the West front of Wells Cathedral, tearing lead from the roof to make bullets, breaking the windows, smashing the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabling their horses in the nave.

Monmouth had risked a night attack, but surprise was lost when a musket was discharged. His untrained supporters were quickly defeated by the professionals, and hundreds were cut down by cannon- and musket-fire. The battle of Sedgemoor is often referred to as the last battle fought on English soil, but this depends on the definition of battle, for which there are different interpretations. Other contenders for the title of last English battle include: the Battle of Preston in Lancashire, which was fought on 14 November 1715, during the First Jacobite Rebellion; and the Second Jacobite Rebellion&apos;s minor engagement at Clifton Moor, near Penrith in Cumbria, on 18 December 1745. The Battle of Culloden fought on Drumossie Moor to the north east of Inverness on 16 April 1746 was the last battle fought on British soil.

It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head. (Though some sources say it took eight blows, the official Tower of London website says it took five blows, { Prisoners at the Tower } while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, claims it was seven. { Spencer, Charles, } { Blenheim, Chapter 3: } { John Churchill, p.54 — &quot; Monmouth had a particularly grisly end, the executioner&apos;s axe striking seven times before his head severed &quot; } ) His dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited, but the subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Monmouth were restored to the Duke of Buccleuch. { Judge Jeffreys } The subsequent Bloody Assizes of Judge Jeffreys were a series of trials of Monmouth&apos;s supporters in which 320 people were condemned to death and around 800 sentenced to be transported to the West Indies. [ The Bloody Assize http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Bloodyassize.htm Somerset County Council 26 May 2010 ] James II took advantage of the suppression of the rebellion to consolidate his power. He asked Parliament to repeal the Test Act and the Habeas Corpus Act, used his dispensing power to appoint Roman Catholics to senior posts, and raised the strength of the standing army. Parliament opposed many of these moves, and on 20 November 1685 James dismissed it. In 1688, when the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart heralded a Catholic succession, James II was overthrown in a coup d&apos;état by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution at the invitation of the disaffected Protestant Establishment.

Arthur Conan Doyle &apos;s historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth&apos;s landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. [ 9504 Monmouth Rebellion ] Several characters in Neal Stephenson &apos;s trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly Quicksilver and The Confusion, play a role in the Monmouth Rebellion and its aftermath. Dr. Peter Blood, main hero of Rafael Sabatini&apos;s novel Captain Blood, was sentenced by Judge Jeffreys for aiding wounded Monmouth rebels. Transported to the Caribbean, he started his career as a pirate there. R. D. Blackmore&apos;s historical novel Lorna Doone is set in the South West of England during the time of Monmouth&apos;s rebellion. John Masefield &apos;s 1910 novel Martin Hyde: The Duke’s Messenger tells the story of a boy who plays a central part in the Monmouth Rebellion, from the meeting with Argyll in Holland to the failed rebellion itself. { Martin Hyde: The Duke’s Messenger by John Masefield.
