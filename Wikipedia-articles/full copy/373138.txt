Licchavi (also Lichchhavi, Lichavi) was an ancient kingdom in Nepal, which existed in the Kathmandu Valley from approximately 400 to 750. Centuries earlier, at the start of the Buddhist era a powerful republic known as Licchavi existed in what is today Bihar. There is no conclusive evidence of any ethnic or historic links between the two states. The language of Licchavi inscriptions is Sanskrit, and the particular script used is closely related to official Gupta script s, suggesting that India was a significant cultural influence. This was likely through Mithila - the northern part of modern Bihar, India. The term &apos;Licchavi&apos; term probably derives from Rikshavi possibly Sanskrit ized to Rkshvavati. Riksha or Rksha in Sanskrit means Star. A table of the evolution of certain Gupta characters used in Licchavi inscriptions prepared by Gautamavajra Vajrācārya can be found online. { Gautamavajra Vajrācārya, &quot; Recently Discovered Inscriptions of Licchavi Nepal &quot;, &apos;&apos;Kathmandu Kailash - Journal of Himalayan Studies.&apos;&apos; Volume 1, Number 2, 1973. (pp. 117-134) } [ Records ] The Lichhavi, having lost their political fortune in India, came to Nepal, attacking and defeating the last Kirat King Gasti. In the Buddhist Pali canon, the Licchavi are mentioned in a number of discourses, most notably the Licchavi Sutta, { &quot; Licchavi Sutta, &quot; translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (2004). } the popular Ratana Sutta { &quot; Ratana Sutta: The Jewel Discourse, &quot; translated from the Pali by Piyadassi Thera (1999). } and the fourth chapter of the Petavatthu. { Petavatthu, Fourth Chapter, in Pali. } The earliest known physical record of the kingdom is an inscription of Manadeva 1, which dates from 464. It mentions three preceding rulers, suggesting that the Licchavi dynasty began in the late fourth century. [ Government ] Copper coin of Jishnu Gupta (ca.

Reverse The Licchavi were ruled by a Maharaja ( &quot; great king &quot; ), who was aided by a prime minister, in charge of the military and of other ministers. Nobles, known as samanta influenced the court whilst simultaneously managing their own landholdings and militia. At one point, between approximately 605 and 641, a prime minister called Amsuvarman actually assumed the throne. The population provided land taxes and conscript labour (vishti) to support the government. Most local administration was performed by village heads or leading families. [ Economy ] The economy was agricultural, relying on rice and other grains as staples. Villages (grama) were grouped into dranga for administration. Lands were owned by the royal family, nobles, temples or groups of Brahman s. Trade was also very important, with many settlements positioned along trading routes. Tibet and India were both trading partners. [ Geography ] [ Domain ] Settlements already filled the entire valley during the Licchavi period. Further settlement was made east toward Banepa, west toward Tisting, and northwest toward present-day Gorkha. [ Sites ] [ Bodhnath ] A stupa was located at Bodhnath. [ Bhadgaon ] Bhadgaon was a small village called Khoprn ( Sanskrit Khoprngrama) along the main trade route. This is the precursor to Bhaktapur. [ Chabahil ] A stupa was located at Chabahil. [ Deopatan ] A shrine of Shiva was located at Deopatan. [ Hadigaon ] A shrine of Vishnu was located at Hadigaon. [ Kathmandu ] Modern day Kathmandu consisted of the two villages of Koligrama ( &quot; Village of the Kolis &quot;; Nepal Bhasa Yambu), and Dakshinakoligrama ( &quot; South Koli Village &quot;, Nepal Bhasa Yangala) straddling the main Kathmandu Valley trade route. [ Patan ] Patan was called Yala ( &quot; Village of the Sacrificial Post &quot;; Sanskrit Yupagrama). It is probably the oldest center of Nepal, though building remains are scarce. [ Swayambhunath ] A stupa was located at Swayambhunath.
