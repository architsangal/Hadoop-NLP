Kin selection refers to apparent strategies in evolution that favour the reproductive success of an organism&apos;s relatives, even at a cost to the organism&apos;s own survival and reproduction. Charles Darwin was the first to discuss the concept of group/kin selection. In the &quot; The Origin of Species &quot;, he wrote clearly about altruistic sterile social insects that This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the desired end. Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together. An animal thus characterized has been slaughtered, but the breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has succeeded &quot; [www.classicreader.com/book/107/59/] In this passage &quot; the family &quot; and &quot; stock &quot; stand for a kin group. These passages and others by Darwin about &quot; kin selection &quot; are highlighted and justly celebrated in D.J. Futuyma&apos;s textbook of reference &quot; Evolutionary Biology &quot; [(3rd edit.p595) ] and in E.O Wilson&apos;s &quot; Sociobiology &quot; [25th edit.p117-118]. The earliest mathematically formal treatments of kin selection were by R.A. Fisher in 1930 [ The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection Fisher R. A. 1930 Clarendon Press Oxford ] and J. B. S. Haldane in 1932 [ The Causes of Evolution Haldane J.B.S. 1932 Longmans, Green &amp; Co London ] and 1955. [ Haldane J. B. S. 1955 Population Genetics New Biology 18 34–51 ] Later on, in works published in 1963 [ Hamilton W. D. 1963 The evolution of altruistic behavior American Naturalist 97 896 354–356 10.1086/497114 ] and—most importantly—in 1964, [ Hamilton W. D. 1964 The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior Journal of Theoretical Biology 7 1 1–16 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 5875341 ] W. D. Hamilton popularized the concept and the more thorough mathematical treatment given to it by George Price. The term &quot; kin selection &quot; may first have been coined by John Maynard Smith in 1964 when he wrote: These processes I will call kin selection and group selection respectively. Kin selection has been discussed by Haldane and by Hamilton. … By kin selection I mean the evolution of characteristics which favour the survival of close relatives of the affected individual, by processes which do not require any discontinuities in the population breeding structure. [ Smith J. M. 1964 Group Selection and Kin Selection Nature 201 4924 1145–1147 10.1038/2011145a0 ] Kin selection refers to changes in gene frequency across generations that are driven at least in part by interactions between related individuals, and this forms much of the conceptual basis of the theory of social evolution. Indeed, some cases of evolution by natural selection can only be understood by considering how biological relatives influence one another&apos;s fitness. Under natural selection, a gene encoding a trait that enhances the fitness of each individual carrying it should increase in frequency within the population; and conversely, a gene that lowers the individual fitness of its carriers should be eliminated. However, a hypothetical gene that prompts behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the behavior, may nonetheless increase in frequency, because relatives often carry the same gene; this is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection. According to the theory, the enhanced fitness of relatives can at times more than compensate for the fitness loss incurred by the individuals displaying the behaviour. As such, this is a special case of a more general model, called inclusive fitness (in that inclusive fitness refers simply to gene copies in other individuals, without requiring that they be kin). However the validity of this analysis has recently been challenged. { Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita &amp; } { EO Wilson &quot; The evolution of eusociality &quot; Nature 466 1057–1062(26 August 2010) doi:10.1038/nature09205 } [ Hamilton&apos;s rule ] Formally, such genes should increase in frequency when \quad rB &gt; C where r = the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the actor, often defined as the probability that a gene picked randomly from each at the same locus is identical by descent. B = the additional reproductive benefit gained by the recipient of the altruistic act, C = the reproductive cost to the individual of performing the act. This inequality is known as Hamilton&apos;s rule after W. D. Hamilton who published, in 1964, the first formal quantitative treatment of kin selection to deal with the evolution of apparently altruistic acts. Originally, the definition for relatedness (r) in Hamilton&apos;s rule was explicitly given as Sewall Wright &apos;s coefficient of relationship : the probability that at a random locus, the allele s there will be identical by descent (Hamilton 1963, American Naturalist, p.  355). Subsequent authors, including Hamilton, sometimes reformulate this with a regression, which, unlike probabilities, can be negative, and so it is possible for individuals to be negatively related, which simply means that two individuals can be less genetically alike than two random ones on average (Hamilton 1970, Nature &amp; Grafen 1985 Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology). This has been invoked to explain the evolution of spite ful behaviours. Spiteful behavior defines an act (or acts) that results in harm, or loss of fitness, to both the actor and the recipient. In the 1930s J.B.S. Haldane had full grasp of the basic quantities and considerations that play a role in kin selection. He famously said that, &quot; I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins &quot;. [ 1999 Psychologically Speaking: A Book of Quotations Altruism Kevin Connolly and Margaret Martlew 10 BPS Books 1-85433-302-X ] { (see also: } { Haldane&apos;s Wikiquote entry ) } Kin altruism is the term for altruistic behaviour whose evolution is supposed to have been driven by kin selection. Haldane&apos;s remark alluded to the fact that if an individual loses its life to save two siblings, four nephews, or eight cousins, it is a &quot; fair deal &quot; in evolutionary terms, as siblings are on average 50% identical by descent, nephews 25%, and cousins 12.5% (in a diploid population that is randomly mating and previously outbred ). But Haldane also joked that he would truly die only to save more than a single identical twin of his or more than two full siblings. In 2011, experimentalists found empirically that Hamilton&apos;s rule describes very accurately the conditions under which altruism emerged in simulated populations of foraging robots. The accuracy of this first quantitative corroboration of Hamilton&apos;s rule is all the more impressive given that Hamilton&apos;s model made several simplifications that did not apply to the foraging robots. [ Waibel Markus 2011 May A quantitative test of Hamilton&apos;s rule for the evolution of altruism PLoS Biol. 9 5 e1000615 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000615 21559320 Barton Nick H. 3086867 1 Floreano D Keller L ] [ Mechanisms ] An altruistic case is one where the instigating individual suffers a fitness loss while the receiving individual benefits by a fitness gain. The sacrifice of one individual to help another is an example of altruism. Hamilton (1964) outlined two ways in which kin selection altruism could be favoured: [ The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious. It may be, for instance, that in respect of a certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately, an individual is only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind.” (1996 [1964], 51) ] Kin Recognition: Firstly, if individuals have the capacity to recognize kin ( kin recognition ) and to adjust their behaviour on the basis of kinship (kin discrimination), then the average relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough for this to be favoured. Because of the facultative nature of this mechanism, it is generally regarded that kin recognition and discrimination are unimportant except among &apos;higher&apos; forms of life (although there is some evidence for this mechanism among protozoa ). Note also that kin recognition may be selected for inbreeding avoidance, and there is little evidence than &apos;innate&apos; kin recognition plays a role in mediating altruism. A thought experiment on the kin recognition/discrimination distinction is the hypothetical &apos; green beard&apos;, where a gene for social behaviour is imagined to also cause a distinctive phenotype that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene. Due to conflicting genetic similarity in the rest of the genome, there would be selection pressure for green-beard altruistic sacrifices to be suppressed, thus making common ancestry the only likely form of inclusive fitness (see Hamilton, below). Viscous Populations: Secondly, even indiscriminate altruism may be favoured in so-called viscous populations, i.e. those characterized by low rates or short ranges of dispersal. Here, social partners are typically genealogically close kin, and so altruism may be able to flourish even in the absence of kin recognition and kin discrimination faculties — spatial proximity and circumstantial cues serve as a rudimentary form of discrimination. This suggests a rather general explanation for altruism. Directional selection will always favor those with higher rates of fecundity within a certain population. Social individuals can often ensure the survival of their own kin by participating in, and following the rules of a group (assuming the implied faculties for group discrimination). Hamilton later modified his thinking to suggest that an innate ability to recognise actual genetic relatedness would be unlikely to be the dominant mediating mechanism for kin altruism (see also kin recognition ): [ But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees.(Hamilton 1987, 425) Hamilton, W.D. (1987) Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley. ] Hamilton&apos;s later clarifications often go unnoticed, and because of the persistence of the long standing assumption that kin selection theory necessarily predicts that social cooperation requires innate powers of kin recognition, some theorists have tried to clarify the position in recent work: [ In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory, Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways — kin discrimination or limited dispersal ( Hamilton, 1964, 1971,1972, 1975). There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt &amp; Bever (2009) and West et al. (2002a), as well as experimental evolution tests of these models (Diggle et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2004; Kümmerli et al., 2009 ). However, despite this, it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination (Oates &amp; Wilson, 2001; Silk, 2002 ). Furthermore, a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives... [T]here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation. The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination (misconception 5), despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964; Hamilton, 1971; Hamilton, 1972; Hamilton, 1975). (West et al. 2010, p.243 and supplement) West et al. 2011. Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans. Evolution and Social Behaviour 32 (2011) 231-262 ] The assumption that innate power of kin recognition must be present, and that cue-based mediation of social cooperation based on limited dispersal and shared developmental context are not sufficient, has obscured significant progress made in applying kin selection and inclusive fitness theory to a wide variety of species, including humans, { Holland, Maximilian. (2004) &apos;&apos;Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches&apos;&apos;. London School of Economics, PhD Thesis } on the basis of cue-based mediation of social bonding and social behaviours. [ Kin selection and human social patterns ] [ Darwinian anthropology Nurture kinship ] Evolutionary psychologists, following Darwinian anthropologists&apos; interpretation { Daly, M. and Wilson, M.I. (1999) An evolutionary psychological perspective on homicide. In Homicide Studies: A Sourcebook of Social Research, edited by D. Smith and M. Zahn. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications } of kin selection theory initially attempted to explain human altruistic behavior through kin selection by stating that “behaviors that help a genetic relative are favored by natural selection.” However, most Evolutionary psychologists recognize that this common short-hand formulation is inaccurate; [ [M]any misunderstandings persist. In many cases, they result from conflating “coefficient of relatedness” and “proportion of shared genes,” which is a short step from the intuitively appealing—but incorrect—interpretation that “animals tend to be altruistic toward those with whom they share a lot of genes.” These misunderstandings don’t just crop up occasionally; they are repeated in many writings, including undergraduate psychology textbooks—most of them in the field of social psychology, within sections describing evolutionary approaches to altruism. (Park 2007, p860) Park, J.H. (2007) Persistent Misunderstandings of Inclusive Fitness and Kin Selection: Their Ubiquitous Appearance in Social Psychology Textbooks. Evolutionary Psychology 5(4): 860-873. ] As with the earlier sociobiological forays into the cross-cultural data, typical approaches are not able to find explanatory fit with the findings of ethnographers; that human kinship patterns are not necessarily built upon blood-ties. However, as Hamilton&apos;s later refinements of his theory make clear, it does not simply predict that genetically related individuals will inevitably recognise and engage in positive social behaviours with genetic relatives: rather, indirect context-based mechanisms may have evolved, which in historical environments have met the inclusive fitness criterion (see above section). Consideration of the demographics of the typical evolutionary environment of any species is crucial to understanding the evolution of social behaviours. As Hamilton himself puts it, “Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.” (Hamilton 1987, 420). Under this perspective, and noting the necessity of a reliable context of interaction being available, the data on how altruism is mediated in social mammals is readily made sense of. In social mammals, primates and humans, altruistic acts that meet the kin selection criterion are typically mediated by circumstantial cues such as shared developmental environment, familiarity and social bonding. { Sherman et al (1997) Recognition Systems. In Behavioural Ecology, edited by J. R. Krebs and N. B. Davies. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific. } That is, it is the context that mediates the development of the bonding process and the expression of the altruistic behaviours, not genetic relatedness per se. This interpretation thus is compatible with the cross-cultural ethnographic data and has been called nurture kinship. [ Examples ] Experiment about kin selection Eusociality (true sociality) is used to describe social systems with three characteristics: one is an overlap in generations between parents and their offspring, two is cooperative brood care, and the third characteristic is specialized castes of nonreproductive individuals. [ Evolutionary Analysis Freeman Scott Herron, Jon C. 2007 4th Pearson, Prentice Hall Upper Saddle River, NJ 0-13-227584-8 460 ] Social insects are an excellent example of organisms that display presumed kin selected traits. The workers of some species are sterile, a trait that would not occur if individual selection was the only process at work. The relatedness coefficient r is abnormally high between the worker sisters in a colony of Hymenoptera due to haplodiploidy, and Hamilton&apos;s rule is presumed to be satisfied because the benefits in fitness for the workers are believed to exceed the costs in terms of lost reproductive opportunity, though this has never been demonstrated empirically. There are competing hypotheses, as well, which may also explain the evolution of social behavior in such organisms (see Eusociality ). Another example is preference among individuals in sun-tailed monkey communities. Data shows that maternal kin (kin related to by mothers) behaved more preferentially towards each other. However, once kin got beyond half-siblings or further relatives, this bias dropped significantly.

While they may alert others of the same species to danger, they draw attention to the caller and expose it to increased risk of predation. Paul Sherman, of Cornell University, studied the alarm calls of ground squirrels. He observed that they occurred most frequently when the caller had relatives nearby. [ http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n11_v154/ai_21156998 10.2307/4010761 Milius, Susan Science News 154 11 174–175 1998 The Science of Eeeeek! 2008-07-02 4010761 Science News, Vol. 154, No. 11 ] In a similar study, John Hoogland was able to follow individual males through different stages of life. He found that the male prairie dogs modified their rate of calling when closer to kin. These behaviors show that self-sacrifice is directed towards close relatives and that there is an indirect fitness gain. Alan Krakauer of University of California, Berkeley has studied kin selection in the courtship behavior of wild turkeys. Like a teenager helping her older sister prepare for prom night, a subordinate turkey may help his dominant brother put on an impressive team display that is only of direct benefit to the dominant member. { In the mating game, male wild turkeys benefit even when they do not get the girl, Robert Sanders } Recent studies provide evidence that even certain plants can recognize and respond to kinship ties. Using sea rocket for her experiments, Susan Dudley at McMaster University in Canada compared the growth patterns of unrelated plants sharing a pot to plants from the same clone. She found that unrelated plants competed for soil nutrients by aggressive root growth. This did not occur with sibling plants.

This association is thought to proceed as a result of a &quot; green beard effect &quot; in which the spermatozoa perform a kin-selective altruistic act after identifying genetic similarity with the surrounding spermatozoa. [ Moore Harry 2002 Exceptional sperm cooperation in the wood mouse Nature 418 6894 174–177 10.1038/nature00832 12110888 1 Dvoráková Katerina Jenkins Nicholas Breed William ] [ Human examples ] Whether or not Hamilton&apos;s rule always applies, studies have demonstrated that relatedness is often important for human altruism in that humans are inclined to behave more altruistically toward kin than toward unrelated individuals. { Cartwright, J. (2000). Evolution and human behavior: Darwinian perspectives on human nature. Massachusetts: MIT Press. } Many people choose to live near relatives, exchange sizable gifts with relatives, and favor relatives in wills in proportion to their relatedness. Experimental studies, interviews, and surveys A study interviewed several hundred women in Los Angeles to study patterns of helping between kin versus non-kin. While non-kin friends were willing to help one another, their assistance was far more likely to be reciprocal. The largest amounts of non-reciprocal help, however, were reportedly provided by kin. Additionally, more closely related kin were considered more likely sources of assistance than distant kin. [ Essock-Vitale S.M., McQuire M.T. 1985 Women&apos;s lives viewed from an evolutionary perspective. II. Patterns in helping Ethology and Sociobiology 6 3 155–173 10.1016/0162-3095(85)90028-7 ] Similarly, several surveys of American college students found that individuals were more likely to incur the cost of assisting kin when a high probability that relatedness and benefit would be greater than cost existed. Participants’ feelings of helpfulness were stronger toward family members than non-kin. Additionally, participants were found to be most willing to help those individuals most closely related to them. Interpersonal relationships between kin in general were more supportive and less Machiavellian than those between non-kin. [ Barber N 1994 Machiavellianism and altruism: Effects of relatedness of target person on Machiavellian and helping attitudes Psychological Report 75 403–22 ] In one experiment, the longer participants (from both the UK and the South African Zulus) held a painful skiing position, the more money or food was presented to a given relative. Participants repeated the experiment for individuals of different relatedness (parents and siblings at r =.5, grandparents, nieces, and nephews at r =.25, etc.). The results showed that participants held the position for longer intervals the greater the degree of relatedness between themselves and those receiving the reward.

Fieldman G. 3 Plotkin Henry C. Dunbar Robin I. M. Richardson Jean-Marie McFarland David ] Observational studies A study of food-sharing practices on the West Caroline islets of Ifaluk determined that food-sharing was more common among people from the same islet, possibly because the degree of relatedness between inhabitants of the same islet would be higher than relatedness between inhabitants of different islets. When food was shared between islets, the distance the sharer was required to travel correlated with the relatedness of the recipient—a greater distance meant that the recipient needed to be a closer relative. The relatedness of the individual and the potential inclusive fitness benefit needed to outweigh the energy cost of transporting the food over distance. [ Betzig L., Turke P. 1986 Food sharing on Ifaluk Current Anthropology 27 4 397–400 10.1086/203457 ] Humans may use the inheritance of material goods and wealth to maximize their inclusive fitness. By providing close kin with inherited wealth, an individual may improve his or her kin’s reproductive opportunities and thus increase his or her own inclusive fitness even after death. A study of a thousand wills found that the beneficiaries who received the most inheritance were generally those most closely related to the will’s writer. Distant kin received proportionally less inheritance, with the least amount of inheritance going to non-kin. [ Smith M., Kish B., Crawford C. 1987 Inheritance of wealth as human kin investment Ethology and Sociobiology 8 3 171–182 10.1016/0162-3095(87)90042-2 ] A study of childcare practices among Canadian women found that respondents with children provide childcare reciprocally with non-kin. The cost of caring for non-kin was balanced by the benefit a woman received—having her own offspring cared for in return. However, respondents without children were significantly more likely to offer childcare to kin. For individuals without their own offspring, the inclusive fitness benefits of providing care to closely related children might outweigh the time and energy costs of childcare. [ Davis J.N., Daly M. 1997 Evolutionary theory and the human family Quarterly Review of Biology 72 4 407–35 10.1086/419953 9407672 ] Family investment in offspring among black South African households also appears consistent with an inclusive fitness model. [ Anderson K.G. 2005 Relatedness and investment: Children in South Africa Human Nature—An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective 16 1–31 ] A higher degree of relatedness between children and their caregivers frequently correlated with a higher degree of investment in the children, with more food, health care, and clothing being provided. Relatedness between the child and the rest of the household also positively associated with the regularity of a child’s visits to local medical practitioners and with the highest grade the child had completed in school. Additionally, relatedness negatively associated with a child’s being behind in school for his or her age. Observation of the Dolgan hunter-gatherers of northern Russia suggested that, while reciprocal food-sharing occurs between both kin and non-kin, there are larger and more frequent asymmetrical transfers of food to kin. Kin are also more likely to be welcomed to non-reciprocal meals, while non-kin are discouraged from attending. Finally, even when reciprocal food-sharing occurs between families, these families are often very closely related, and the primary beneficiaries are the offspring. [ Ziker J., Schnegg M. 2005 Food sharing at meals: Kinship, reciprocity, and clustering in the Taimyr Autonomous Okrug, northern Russia Human Nature—An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective 16 178–210 ] Other research indicates that violence in families is more likely to occur when step-parents are present and that &quot; genetic relationship is associated with a softening of conflict, and people&apos;s evident valuations of themselves and of others are systematically related to the parties&apos; reproductive values &quot;.

The authors argue that &quot; Inclusive fitness theory is not a simplification over the standard approach. It is an alternative accounting method, but one that works only in a very limited domain. Whenever inclusive fitness does work, the results are identical to those of the standard approach. Inclusive fitness theory is an unnecessary detour, which does not provide additional insight or information. &quot; The authors argue for the use of a multi-level selection based model instead.
