After being edited down from about 300 hours of raw footage, the series ran one season of 12 episodes on Thursday nights at 9:00 p.m. Originally intended to be a chronicle of the daily life of an American family, the groundbreaking program documented the break-up of the Loud family via the separation and subsequent divorce of parents Bill and Pat Loud. { Cf. Loud, Pat, Pat Loud: A Woman&apos;s Story, 1974 } [ The series ] In 2011, The New York Times reflected on some of the controversy the series engendered: [ For the viewing public, the controversy surrounding An American Familydoubled as a crash course in media literacy. The Louds, in claiming that the material had been edited to emphasize the negative, called attention to how nonfiction narratives are fashioned. Some critics argued that the camera’s presence encouraged the subjects to perform. Some even said it invalidated the project. That line of reasoning, as Mr. Gilbert has pointed out, would invalidate all documentaries. It also discounts the role of performance in everyday life, and the potential function of the camera as a catalyst, not simply an observer.
