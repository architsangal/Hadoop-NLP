An alumna of the Film and Television Institute of India of Pune, she made her film debut in 1974 and soon became one of the leading actresses of parallel cinema, an Indian New Wave movement known for its serious content and neo-realism. [ Parallel cinema seeing changes: Azmi PTI 22 July 2005 2009-01-31 The Times of India http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1179589.cms ] [ Shabana&apos;s soap opera K., Bhumika 21 January 2006 2009-01-31 The Hindu http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/01/21/stories/2006012100690100.htm ] Regarded as one of the finest actresses in India, Azmi&apos;s performances in films in a variety of genres have generally earned her praise and awards, which include a record of five wins of the National Film Award for Best Actress and several international honours.

Azmi has appeared in over 120 Hindi films in both mainstream and independent cinema, and since 1988 she has acted in several foreign projects. In addition to acting, Azmi is a social and women&apos;s rights activist, a Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA), and a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament. She is married to Indian poet and screenwriter Javed Akhtar. [ In &apos;Bollywood,&apos; Women Are Wronged or Revered Edward A. Gargan New York Times 17 January 1993 http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/movies/film-in-bollywood-women-are-wronged-or-revered.html?pagewanted%3Dall ] [ Early life and background ] Shabana Azmi was born in a Muslim family. Her parents are Kaifi Azmi (an Indian poet) and Shaukat Azmi (a veteran Indian People&apos;s Theatre Association stage actress), both of whom were members of the Communist Party of India. Her brother, Baba Azmi, is a cinematographer. Her parents had an active social life, and their home was always thriving with people and activities of the communist party. It was not unusual for her to wake up in the morning and find members of the communist party sleeping about, from a previous night&apos;s communist social that ran late. Early in childhood, the environment in her home was inculcated into her a respect for family ties, social and human values; and her parents always supported her to develop a passion for intellectual stimulation and growth.

She completed a graduate degree in Psychology from St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai, and followed it with a course in acting at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune. She described the reason she decided to attend the film institute, saying, &quot; I had had the privilege of watching Jaya Bhaduri in a (Diploma) film, Suman, and I was completely enchanted by her performance because it was unlike the other performances I had seen. I really marvelled at that and said, &apos;My god, if by going to the Film Institute I can achieve that, that&apos;s what I want to do.&apos; &quot; Azmi eventually topped the list of successful candidates of 1972. [ http://www.iaac.us/Indian%20Diaspora%20Film%20Festival%202004/Shabanaazmi.htm Indo-American Arts Council ] [ Career ] Azmi graduated from the FTII in 1973 and went on to sign on Khwaja Ahmad Abbas &apos; Faasla and began work on Kanti Lal Rathod&apos;s Parinay as well. Her first release, however, was Shyam Benegal &apos;s directorial debut Ankur (1974). Belonging to the arthouse genre of neo-realistic films, Ankur is based on a true story which occurred in Hyderabad. Azmi played Lakshmi, a married servant and villager who drifts into an affair with a college student who visits the countryside. Azmi was not the original choice for the film, and several leading actresses of that time refused to do it. The film went on to become a major critical success, and Azmi won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performances. Upperstall.com described her work in the film as &quot; an outstanding psychologically penetrating performance very different from those seen normally till then in mainstream Hindi cinema &quot;, and famous independent filmmaker Satyajit Ray commented, &quot; In Ankur she may not have fitted immediately into her rustic surroundings, but her poise and personality are never in doubt. In two high pitched scenes, she pulls out the stops to firmly establish herself as one of our finest dramatic actresses &quot;. [ Shabana Azmi http://www.upperstall.com/people/shabana-azmi Upperstall.com 2009-07-29 ] She went on to receive the National Film Award consecutively for three years from 1983 to 1985 for her roles in movies, Arth, Khandhar and Paar. Another film Godmother (1999) earned her another National Film Award, taking her tally to five. Azmi’s acting has been characterized by a real-life depiction of the roles played by her. In Mandi, she acted as a madam of a whorehouse. For this role, she put on weight and even chewed betel. Real life portrayals continued in almost all her movies. These included the role of a woman named Jamini resigned to her destiny in Khandhar, and a typical urban Indian wife, homemaker and mother in Masoom. She also acted in experimental and parallel Indian cinema. Deepa Mehta’s 1996 film Fire depicts her as a lonely woman, Radha, in love with her sister-in-law. The on-screen depiction of lesbianism (perhaps the first in Indian cinema) drew severe protests and threats from many social groups as well as by the Indian authorities. Her role as Radha brought her international recognition with the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 32nd Chicago Film Festival and Jury Award for Best Actress at Outfest, Los Angeles. Some of her notable films include Shyam Benegal &apos;s Nishant (1975), Junoon (1978), Susman (1986), and Antarnaad (1992); Satyajit Ray ’s Shatranj Ke Khiladi; Mrinal Sen ’s Khandhar, Genesis, Ek Din Achanak; Saeed Mirza’s Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai; Sai Paranjpye’s Sparsh and Disha; Gautam Ghose ’s Paar; Aparna Sen ’s Picnic and Sati; Mahesh Bhatt ’s Arth; Vinay Shukla’s Godmother. Her other films include the commercially successful Manmohan Desai &apos;s Amar Akbar Anthony, and Parvarish and Prakash Mehra ’s Jwalamukhi. Azmi starred in Hollywood productions such as John Schlesinger ’s Madame Sousatzka (1988) and Roland Joffe’s City of Joy (1992). Azmi debuted on the small screen in a soap opera titled Anupama. She portrayed a modern Indian woman who, while endorsing traditional Indian ethos and values, negotiated more freedom for herself. She had also participated in many stage plays, and notable among them include M. S. Sathyu’s Safed Kundali (1980), based on The Caucasian Chalk Circle; and Feroz Abbas Khan &apos;s Tumhari Amrita along with actor Farooq Sheikh, which ran for five years. She toured Singapore on an assignment with the Singapore Repertory Theatre Company, acting in Ingmar Bergman ’s adaptation of Ibsen ’s A Doll&apos;s House, which was directed by Rey Buono. Pointing out the differences in all these media, she once remarked that theatre was really the actor’s medium; the stage was actor’s space; cinema was the director’s medium; and television was a writer’s medium. [ March 2010 ] [ Personal life ] In the initial stage of her career, she was linked to film director Shekhar Kapur. [ December 2011 ] She married Javed Akhtar, a lyricist, poet and Bollywood scriptwriter on 9 December 1984, making her a member of the Akhtar-Azmi film family. { THE DYNAMIC DYNASTIES: What would the world of films be without them? Screen, September 22, 2000. } It was Akhtar’s second marriage, the first being with Bollywood scriptwriter, Honey Irani.

[ Social activism ] Shabana Azmi has been a committed social activist, active in supporting child survival and fighting AIDS and injustice in real life. [ United Nations Biographies: A-F http://www.un.org/advocates/bios.htm 2011-02-24 ] [ The Tribune 1999-10-12 2011-02-24 World population crosses 6 billion http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99oct13/nation.htm#a Tribune News Service ] Azmi has voiced her opinion on a variety of issues. Initially, her activism drew skepticism and was dubbed by some as a publicity gimmick. However, she proved her critics wrong and used her celebrity status to emerge as a high-profile social activist. She had participated in several plays and demonstrations denouncing communalism. In 1989, along with Swami Agnivesh and Asghar Ali Engineer, she undertook a four-day march for communal harmony from New Delhi to Meerut. Among the social groups whose causes she has advocated are slum dwellers, displaced Kashmiri Pandit migrants and victims of the earthquake at Latur ( Maharashtra, India). The 1993 Mumbai riots appalled her and she emerged as a forceful critic of religious extremism. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, she opposed the advice of the grand mufti of Jama Masjid calling upon the Muslims of India to join the people of Afghanistan in their fight by retorting that the leader go there alone.

A small film clip issued by the Government of India depicts an HIV positive child cuddled in her arms and saying: &quot; She does not need your rejection, she needs your love &quot;. In a Bengali film named Meghla Aakash she played the role of a physician treating AIDS patients. She has also given her voice to an HIV/AIDS education animated software tutorial created by the nonprofit organization TeachAIDS.

In 1998, the United Nations Population Fund appointed her as its Goodwill Ambassador for India.
