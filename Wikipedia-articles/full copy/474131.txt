[ Kinuyo Tanaka 田中 絹代 Tanaka Kinuyo 29 November 1909 – 21 March 1977 ] was a Japanese actress and director. Tanaka was born in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. She became a leading actress at an early age, appearing in Yasujirō Ozu &apos;s I Graduated, But... in 1929. The following year she played the lead in Aiyoku no ki, and in 1931 she appeared in Japan&apos;s first talkie, The Neighbor&apos;s Wife and Mine, directed by Heinosuke Gosho. She had a close working relationship with director Kenji Mizoguchi, having parts in 15 of his films, including leading roles in The Life of Oharu (1952), Ugetsu (1953) and Sansho the Bailiff (1954). Their working relationship ended when Mizoguchi countered a recommendation from the Directors Guild of Japan for the Nikkatsu studio to hire her as a director. Despite this, the production of her second film as director went ahead, but Tanaka never forgave Mizoguchi, and the reasons for his behaviour are unclear. { Tony Rayns video essays in the } { Masters of Cinema edition of } { Chikamatsu Monogatari / } { Uwasa no onna set. } She also played Noboru Yasumoto&apos;s mother in Akira Kurosawa &apos;s Red Beard (1965). For her portrayal in Kei Kumai &apos;s Sandakan N° 8 she won the Best Actress Award at the 25th Berlin International Film Festival in 1975.
