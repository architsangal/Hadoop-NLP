[ Theory ] String field theory (SFT) is a formalism in string theory in which the dynamics of relativistic strings is reformulated in the language of quantum field theory. This is accomplished at the level of perturbation theory by finding a collection of vertices for joining and splitting strings, as well as string propagator s, that give a Feynman diagram -like expansion for string scattering amplitudes. In most string field theories, this expansion is encoded by a classical action found by second-quantizing the free string and adding interaction terms. As is usually the case in second quantization, a classical field configuration of the second-quantized theory is given by a wave function in the original theory. In the case of string field theory, this implies that a classical configuration, usually called the string field, is given by an element of the free string Fock space. The principal advantages of the formalism are that it allows the computation of off-shell amplitudes and, when a classical action is available, gives non-perturbative information that cannot be seen directly from the standard genus expansion of string scattering. In particular, following the work of Ashoke Sen, { A. Sen, &quot; Universality of the tachyon potential &quot;, JHEP 9912:027, (1999) } it has been useful in the study of tachyon condensation on unstable D-branes. It has also had applications to topological string theory, { E. Witten, &quot; Chern-Simons gauge theory as a string theory &quot;, Prog. Math. 133 637, (1995) } non-commutative geometry, { E. Witten, &quot; Noncommutative tachyons and string field theory &quot;, hep-th/0006071 } and strings in low dimensions. { D. Gaiotto and L. Rastelli, &quot; A Paradigm of open/closed duality: Liouville D-branes and the Kontsevich model &quot;, JHEP 0507:053, (2005) } String field theories come in a number of varieties depending on which type of string is second quantized: Open string field theories describe the scattering of open strings, closed string field theories describe closed strings, while open-closed string field theories include both open and closed strings. In addition, depending on the method used to fix the worldsheet diffeomorphisms and conformal transformation s in the original free string theory, the resulting string field theories can be very different. Using light cone gauge, yields light-cone string field theories whereas using BRST quantization, one finds covariant string field theories. There are also hybrid string field theories, known as covariantized light-cone string field theories which use elements of both light-cone and BRST gauge-fixed string field theories. { H. Hata, K. Itoh, T. Kugo, H. Kunitomo, and K. Ogawa, &quot; Manifestly Covariant Field Theory of Interacting String. &quot; Phys.Lett. B172 (1986) 186. } A final form of string field theory, known as background independent open string field theory, takes a very different form; instead of second quantizing the worldsheet string theory, it second quantizes the space of two-dimensional quantum field theories. { E. Witten, &quot; On background independent open string field theory. &quot; Phys.Rev. D46 (1992) 5467. } [ Light-cone string field theory ] Light-cone string field theories were introduced by Stanley Mandelstam { S. Mandelstam, &quot; Interacting String Picture of The Dual Resonance Models, &quot; Nucl. Phys. B64, 205 (1973); S. Mandelstam, &quot; Interacting String Picture of The Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond Model, &quot; Nucl. Phys. B69, 77 (1974); } and developed by Mandelstam, Michael Green, John Schwarz and Lars Brink. M. B. Green and J. H. Schwarz, “Supersymmetrical Dual String Theory. 2. VerticesAnd Trees,” Nucl. Phys. B198, 252 (1982); { M. B. Green and J. H. Schwarz, &quot; Superstring Interactions, &quot; Nucl. Phys. B218, 43 (1983); } M. B. Green, J. H. Schwarz and L. Brink, “Superfield Theory Of Type II Superstrings,”Nucl. Phys. B 219, 437 (1983); M. B. Green and J. H. Schwarz, “Superstring Field Theory,” Nucl. Phys. B243, 475(1984); S. Mandelstam, &quot; Interacting String Picture Of The Fermionic String, &quot; Prog. Theor. Phys. Suppl. 86, 163 (1986); An explicit description of the second-quantization of the light-cone string was given by Michio Kaku and Keiji Kikkawa. { Michio Kaku and K. Kikkawa, &quot; Field theory of relativistic strings. I. Trees &quot;, Phys. Rev. D10, 1110 (1974); Michio Kaku and K. Kikkawa, &quot; The Field Theory of Relativistic Strings. 2. Loops and Pomerons &quot;, Phys.Rev. D10,1823,(1974). } Light-cone string field theories were the first string field theories to be constructed and are based on the simplicity of string scattering in light-cone gauge. For example, in the bosonic closed string case, the worldsheet scattering diagrams naturally take a Feynman diagram-like form, being built from two ingredients, a propagator, Image:Light Cone String Propagator.svg and two vertices for splitting and joining strings, which can be used to glue three propagators together, Image:Closed String Light Cone Vertex.svg These vertices and propagators produce a single cover of the moduli space of n -point closed string scattering amplitudes so no higher order vertices are required. { E. D’Hoker and S. B. Giddings, “Unitarity Of The Closed Bosonic Polyakov String,”Nucl. Phys. B291 (1987) 90. } Similar vertices exist for the open string. When one considers light-cone quantized superstrings, the discussion is more subtle as divergences can arise when the light-cone vertices collide. { J. Greensite and F. R. Klinkhamer, “New Interactions For Superstrings,” Nucl. Phys.B281 (1987) 269 } To produce a consistent theory, it is necessary to introduce higher order vertices, called contact terms, to cancel the divergences. Light-cone string field theories have the disadvantage that they break manifest Lorentz invariance. However, in backgrounds with light-like killing vectors, they can considerably simplify the quantization of the string action. Moreover, until the advent of the Berkovits string { N. Berkovits, &quot; Super Poincare covariant quantization of the superstring &quot;, JHEP 0004:018, (2000). } it was the only known method for quantizing strings in the presence of Ramond–Ramond field s. In recent research, light-cone string field theory played an important role in understanding strings in pp-wave backgrounds. { M. Spradlin and A. Volovich, &quot; Light-cone string field theory in a plane wave &quot;, Lectures given at ICTP Spring School on Superstring Theory and Related Topics, Trieste, Italy, 31 Mar - 8 Apr (2003) hep-th/0310033. } [ Free covariant string field theory ] An important step in the construction of covariant string field theories (preserving manifest Lorentz invariance ) was the construction of a covariant kinetic term. This kinetic term can be considered a string field theory in its own right: the string field theory of free strings. Since the work of Warren Siegel, { W. Siegel, &quot; String Field Theory Via BRST &quot;, in Santa Barbara 1985, Proceedings, Unified String Theories, 593; W. Siegel, &quot; Introduction to string field theory &quot;, Adv. Ser. Math. Phys. 8. Reprinted as hep-th/0107094 } it has been standard to first BRST-quantize the free string theory and then second quantize so that the classical fields of the string field theory include ghosts as well as matter fields. For example, in the case of the bosonic open string theory in 26-dimensional flat spacetime, a general element of the Fock-space of the BRST quantized string takes the form (in radial quantization in the upper half plane), |\Psi\rangle = \int d^{26} p \left (T(p) c_1 e^{i p\cdot X} |0\rangle + A_\mu (p) \partial X^\mu c_1 e^{i p \cdot X} |0 \rangle + \chi (p) c_0 e^{i p \cdot X}|0\rangle + \ldots \right), where |0\rangle is the free string vacuum and the dots represent more massive fields. In the language of worldsheet string theory, T(p), A_\mu(p), and \chi(p) represent the amplitudes for the string to be found in the various basis states. After second quantization, they are interpreted instead as classical fields representing the tachyon T, gauge field A_\mu and a ghost field \chi. In the worldsheet string theory, the unphysical elements of the Fock space are removed by imposing the condition Q_B |\Psi \rangle = 0 as well as the equivalence relation |\Psi \rangle \sim |\Psi\rangle + Q_B |\Lambda \rangle. After second quantization, the equivalence relation is interpreted as a gauge invariance, whereas the condition that |\Psi \rangle is physical is interpreted as an equation of motion. Because the physical fields live at ghostnumber one, it is also assumed that the string field |\Psi \rangle is a ghostnumber one element of the Fock space. In the case of the open bosonic string a gauge-unfixed action with the appropriate symmetries and equations of motion was originally obtained by André Neveu, Hermann Nicolai and Peter C. West. { A. Neveu, H. Nicolai and P. C. West, &quot; New Symmetries And Ghost Structure Of Covariant String Theories &quot;, Phys.Lett. B167 (1986) 307 } It is given by S_{\text{free open}} (\Psi) = \tfrac{1}{2} \langle \Psi | Q_B |\Psi\rangle \, where \langle \Psi | is the BPZ-dual of |\Psi \rangle. { A. Belavin, A. Polyakov, A. Zamolodichikov, &quot; Infinite Conformal Symmetry in Two-Dimensional Quantum Field Theory &quot;, Nucl. Phys. B241, 333 (1984) } For the bosonic closed string, construction of a BRST-invariant kinetic term requires additionally that one impose (L_0 - \tilde{L}_0) |\Psi\rangle = 0 and (b_0 - \tilde{b}_0) |\Psi\rangle = 0. The kinetic term is then S_{\text{free closed}} = \tfrac{1}{2} \langle \Psi | (c_0 - \tilde{c}_0) Q_B |\Psi \rangle \. Additional considerations are required for the superstrings to deal with the superghost zero-modes. [ Witten&apos;s cubic open string field theory ] The best studied and simplest of covariant interacting string field theories was constructed by Edward Witten. { E. Witten, &quot; Noncommutative Geometry and String Field Theory &quot;, Nucl. Phys B268, 253, (1986) } It describes the dynamics of bosonic open strings and is given by adding to the free open string action a cubic vertex: S(\Psi) = \tfrac{1}{2} \langle \Psi |Q_B |\Psi \rangle + \tfrac{1}{3} \langle \Psi,\Psi,\Psi \rangle, where, as in the free case, \Psi is a ghostnumber one element of the BRST-quantized free bosonic open-string Fock-space. The cubic vertex, \langle \Psi_1,\Psi_2,\Psi_3 \rangle is a triliniar map which takes three string fields of total ghostnumber three and yields a number. Following Witten, who was motivated by ideas from noncommutative geometry, it is conventional to introduce the * -product defined implicitly through \langle\Sigma | \Psi_1 *\Psi_2 \rangle = \langle\Sigma, \Psi_1,\Psi_2\rangle \. The * -product and cubic vertex satisfy a number of important properties (allowing the \Psi_i to be general ghost number fields): &lt; li &gt; Cyclicity : \langle \Psi_1, \Psi_2, \Psi_3 \rangle = (-1)^{gn(\Psi_3) * (gn(\Psi_2)+ gn(\Psi_1))}\langle \Psi_3, \Psi_1, \Psi_2 \rangle &lt; li &gt; { BRST invariance : } Q_B \langle \Psi_1, \Psi_2, \Psi_3 \rangle = \langle Q_B \Psi_1, \Psi_2, \Psi_3 \rangle + (-1)^{gn(\Psi_1)}\langle \Psi_1, Q_B \Psi_2, \Psi_3 \rangle +(-1)^{gn(\Psi_1)+ gn(\Psi_2)}\langle \Psi_1, \Psi_2, Q_B \Psi_3 \rangle For the * -product, this implies that Q_B acts as a graded derivation Q_B (\Psi_1 * \Psi_2) = (Q_B \Psi_1)*\Psi_2 + (-1)^{gn(\Psi_1)} \Psi_1 * (Q_B \Psi_2) &lt; li &gt; Associativity \left(\Psi_1 * \Psi_2\right) * \Psi_3 = \Psi_1 * (\Psi_2 * \Psi_3) In terms of the cubic vertex, \langle\Psi_1,\Psi_2 * \Psi_3,\Psi_4 \rangle = \langle\Psi_1,\Psi_2,\Psi_3* \Psi_4 \rangle In these equations, gn(\Psi) denotes the ghost number of \Psi. [ Gauge invariance ] These properties of the cubic vertex are sufficient to show that S(\Psi) is invariant underthe Yang-Mills -like gauge transformation, \Psi \to \Psi + Q_B \Lambda + \Psi * \Lambda - \Lambda * \Psi \, where \Lambda is an infinitesimal gauge parameter. Finite gauge transformations take the form \Psi \to e^{-\Lambda} (\Psi + Q_B )e^{\Lambda} where the exponential is defined by, e^{\Lambda} = 1 + \Lambda + \tfrac{1}{2} \Lambda* \Lambda + \tfrac{1}{3!} \Lambda * \Lambda * \Lambda + \ldots [ Equations of motion ] The equations of motion are given by Q_B \Psi + \Psi * \Psi = 0 \left. \right. \. Because the string field \Psi is an infinite collection of ordinary classical fields, these equations represent an infinite collection of non-linear coupled differential equations. There have been two approaches to finding solutions: First, numerically, one can truncate the string field to include only fields with mass less than a fixed bound, a procedure known as &quot; level truncation &quot;. { V. Kostelecky and S. Samuel, &quot; Spontaneous Breaking of Lorentz Symmetry in String Theory &quot;, Phys. Rev. D39, 683, (1989) } This reduces the equations of motion to a finite number of coupled differential equations and has led to the discovery of many solutions. { B. Zwiebach, &quot; Is the string field big enough? &quot;, Fortsch. Phys. 49 387 (2001); W. Taylor and B. Zwiebach, &quot; D-branes, tachyons, and string field theory. &quot; Boulder 2001, Strings, branes and extra dimensions 641. } Second, following the work of Martin Schnabl { M. Schnabl, &quot; Analytic solution for tachyon condensation in open string field theory &quot;,Adv.Theor.Math.Phys. 10, (2006) 433 } one can seek analytic solutions by carefully picking an ansatz which has simple behavior under star multiplication and action by the BRST operator. This has led to solutions representing marginal deformations as well as the tachyon vacuum solution { E. Fuchs and M. Kroyter, &quot; Analytical Solutions of Open String Field Theory &quot;, arXiv:0807.4722; } [ Quantization ] To consistently quantize S(\Psi) one has to fix a gauge. The traditional choice has been Feynman-Siegel gauge, b_0 \Psi = 0 \left.\right. \. Because the gauge transformations are themselves redundant (there are gauge transformations of the gauge transformations), the gauge fixing procedure requires introducing an infinite number of ghosts via the BV formalism. { C. Thorn, &quot; String Field Theory &quot;, Phys. Rept. 175, 1, (1989) } The complete gauge fixed action is given by S_{\text{gauge-fixed}} = \tfrac{1}{2} \langle \Psi | c_0 L_0 |\Psi\rangle + \tfrac{1}{3} \langle \Psi,\Psi,\Psi \rangle \, where the field \Psi is now allowed to be of arbitrary ghostnumber. In this gauge, the Feynman diagrams are constructed from a single propagator and vertex. The propagator takes the form of a strip of worldsheet of width \pi and length T Image:OSFT propagator.svg There is also an insertion of an integral of the b -ghost along the red line. The modulus, T is integrated from 0 to \infty. The three vertex can be described as a way of gluing three propagators together as shown in the following picture: Image:OSFT three vertex.svg In order to represent the vertex embedded in three dimensions, the propagators have been folded in half along their midpoints. The resulting geometry is completely flat except for a single curvature singularity where the midpoints of the three propagators meet. These Feynman diagrams generate a complete cover of the moduli space of open string scattering diagrams. It follows that, for on-shell amplitudes, the n-point open string amplitudes computed using Witten&apos;s open string field theory are identical to those computed using standard worldsheet methods. { S. Giddings, E. Martinec and E. Witten, &quot; Modular Invariance in String Field Theory &quot;, Phys. Lett. B176, 362, (1986); B. Zwiebach, &quot; A Proof that Witten&apos;s open string theory gives a single cover of moduli space &quot;, Commun. Math. Phys. 142 193, (1991) } [ Supersymmetric covariant open string field theories ] There are two main constructions of supersymmetric extensions of Witten&apos;s cubic open string field theory. The first is very similar in form to its bosonic cousin and is known as modified cubic superstring field theory. The second, due to Nathan Berkovits is very different and is based on a WZW -type action. [ Modified cubic superstring field theory ] The first consistent extension of Witten&apos;s bosonic open string field theory to the RNS string was constructed by Christian Preitschopf, Charles Thorn and Scott Yost and independently by Irina Aref&apos;eva, P. B. Medvedev and A. P. Zubarev. { C. Preitschopf, C. Thorn and S. Yost, &quot; Superstring Field Theory, &quot; Nucl. Phys. B337 (1990) 363; I. Aref&apos;eva, P. Medvedev and A. Zubarev, &quot; New Representationfor String Field Solves the Consistency Problem for Open Superstring Field Theory, &quot; Nucl.Phys. B341 464 (1990). } The NS string field is taken to be a ghostnumber one picture zero string field in the small Hilbert space (i.e. \eta_0 |\Psi\rangle = 0 ).The action takes a very similar form to bosonic action, S(\Psi) = \tfrac{1}{2} \langle \Psi |Y(i) Y(-i) Q_B |\Psi \rangle +\tfrac{1}{3} \langle \Psi | Y(i) Y(-i) |\Psi * \Psi\rangle \, where, Y(z) = -\partial \xi e^{-2 \phi} c(z) is the inverse picture changing operator. The suggested -\tfrac{1}{2} picture number extension of this theory to the Ramond sector might be problematic. This action has been shown to reproduce tree-level amplitudes and has a tachyon vacuum solution with the correct energy. { Theodore Erler, &quot; Tachyon Vacuum in Cubic Superstring Field Theory &quot;, JHEP 0801:013, (2008) } The one subtlety in the action is the insertion of picture changing operators at the midpoint, which imply that the linearized equations of motion take the form Y(i)Y(-i) Q_B \Psi = 0 \left.\right. \. Because Y(i) Y(-i) has a non-trivial kernel, there are potentially extra solutions that are not in the cohomology of Q_B. { N. Berkovits, &quot; Review of open superstring field theory &quot;, hep-th/0105230 } However, such solutions would have operator insertions near the midpoint and would be potentially singular, and importance of this problem remains unclear. [ Berkovits superstring field theory ] A very different supersymmetric action for the open string was constructed by Nathan Berkovits. It takes the form { N. Berkovits, &quot; Super-Poincare Invariant Superstring Field Theory &quot;, Nucl. Phys. B450 (1995) 90 } S = \tfrac{1}{2} \langle e^{-\Phi} Q_B e^{\Phi} | e^{-\Phi} \eta_0 e^{\Phi} \rangle - \tfrac{1}{2} \int_0^1 dt\langle e^{ -\hat{\Phi}} \partial_t e^{\hat{\Phi}}|\{e^{-\hat{\Phi}} Q_B e^{\hat{\Phi}}, e^{-\hat{\Phi}} \eta_0 e^{\hat{\Phi}} \} \rangle where all of the products are performed using the * -product including the anticommutator \{,\}, and \hat{\Phi}(t) is any string field such that \hat{\Phi}(0) = 0 and \hat{\Phi}(1) = \Phi. The string field \Phi is taken to be in the NS sector of the large Hilbert space, i.e. including the zero mode of \xi. It is not known how to incorporate the R sector, although some preliminary ideas exist. { Y. Michishita, &quot; A covariant action with a constraint and Feynman rules for fermions in open superstring field theory &quot;, hep-th/0412215 } The equations of motion take the form \eta_0 \left(e^{-\Phi} Q_B e^{\Phi} \right) = 0 The action is invariant under the gauge invariance e^{\Phi} \to e^{Q_B \Lambda} e^{\Phi} e^{\eta_0 \Lambda&apos;} The principal advantage of this action is that it free from any insertions of picture-changing operators. It has been shown to reproduce correctly tree level amplitudes { N. Berkovits and C. Echevarria, &quot; Four-Point Amplitudes from Open Superstring Field Theory &quot;, Phys.Lett. B478 (2000) 343 } and has been found, numerically, to have a tachyon vacuum with appropriate energy. { N. Berkovits, &quot; The Tachyon potential in open Neveu-Schwarz string field theory, &quot; JHEP 0004:022 (2000); N. Berkovits, A. Sen and B. Zwiebach, &quot; Tachyon condensation in superstring field theory &quot;, Nucl.Phys. B587 (2000) 147 } The only known analytic solutions to the classical equations of motion are marginal deformations. [ Other formulations of covariant open superstring field theory ] A formulation of superstring field theory using the non-minimal pure-spinor variables was introduced by Berkovits. { N. Berkovits, &quot; Pure spinor formalism as an N=2 topological string &quot;, hep-th/0509120 } The action is cubic and includes a mid-point insertion whose kernel is trivial. As always within the pure-spinor formulation, the Ramond sector can be easily treated. However, it is not known how to incorporate the GSO- sectors into the formalism. In an attempt to resolve the allegedly problematic mid-point insertion of the modified cubic theory, Berkovits and Siegel proposed a superstring field theory based on a non-minimal extension of the RNS string, { N. Berkovits and W. Siegel, &quot; Regularizing cubic open Neveu-Schwarz string field theory &quot;, arXiv:0901.3386 } which uses a mid-point insertion with no kernel. It is not clear if such insertions are in any way better than mid-point insertions with non-trivial kernels. [ Covariant closed string field theory ] Covariant closed string field theories are considerably more complicated than their open string cousins. Even if one wants to construct a string field theory which only reproduces tree-level interactions between closed strings, the classical action must contain an infinite number of vertices { H. Sonoda and B. Zwiebach, &quot; Covariant Closed String Theory Cannot Be Cubic &quot;, Nucl.Phys. B336 (1990) 185 } consisting of string polyhedra. { M. Saadi and B. Zwiebach, &quot; Closed string field theory from polyhedra &quot;, Annals Phys 192 (1989) 213; T. Kugo, K. Suehiro, &quot; Nonpolynomian Closed String Field Theory: Action And Its Gauge Invariance &quot;, Nucl.Phys. B337 (1990) 434. } If one demands that on-shell scattering diagrams be reproduced to all orders in the string coupling, one must also include additional vertices arising from higher genus (and hence higher order in \hbar ) as well. In general, a manifestly BV invariant, quantizable action takes the form { B. Zwiebach, &quot; Closed string field theory: Quantum action and the B-V master equation &quot;, Nucl.Phys. B390 (1993) 33 } S(\Psi) = \hbar \sum_{g \ge 0} (\hbar g_c)^{g-1} \sum_{n \ge 0} \frac{1}{n!} \{\Psi^n \}_g where \{ \Psi^n \}_g denotes an n th order vertex arising from a genus g surface and g_c is the closed string coupling. The structure of the vertices is in principle determined by a minimal area prescription, { B. Zwiebach, &quot; Quantum closed strings from minimal area &quot;, Mod Phys. Lett. A5 (1990) 2753 } although, even for the polyhedral vertices, explicit computations have only been performed to quintic order. { N. Moeller, &quot; Closed Bosonic String Field Theory at Quintic Order: Five-Tachyon Contact Term and Dilaton Theorem &quot;, JHEP 0703:043 (2007); N. Moeller, &quot; Closed Bosonic String Field Theory at Quintic Order. II. Marginal Deformations and Effective Potential &quot;, JHEP 0709:118, (2007) } [ Covariant heterotic string field theory ] A formulation of the NS sector of the heterotic string was given by Berkovits, Okawa and Zwiebach. { N. Berkovits, Y. Okawa and B. Zwiebach, &quot; WZW-like action for heterotic string field theory &quot;, hep-th/0409018 } The formulation amalgams bosonic closed string field theory with Berkovits&apos; superstring field theory.
