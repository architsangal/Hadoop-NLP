Escambia County is a county of the U.S. state of Alabama. As of 2010, the population was 38,319. Its county seat is Brewton. [ History ] Historic American Indian tribes in the area included the Creek, Choctaw, and Alabama, who had inhabited the lands for centuries for hunting and settlements. The former two tribes were among those in the Southeast whom the European-American settlers called the Five Civilized Tribes, as they adopted some European-American cultural ways in an attempt to survive alongside the encroachment of settlers moving west. Most of these peoples were removed by United States forces in the 1830s to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Escambia County was established after the American Civil War, on December 10, 1868 during the Reconstruction era. The state legislature created it from parts of Baldwin and Conecuh counties, to the west and north, respectively. The area was part of the coastal plain, and had been developed by nineteenth-century settlers as plantations. The name &quot; Escambia &quot; may have been derived from the Creek name Shambia, meaning &quot; clearwater &quot;, { Escambia County Alabama History - accessed August 18, 2009 } or the Choctaw word for &quot; cane-brake &quot; or &quot; reed-brake &quot;. There is also an Escambia County in Florida. { Alabama Department of Archives and History - accessed August 18, 2009 } In September 1979, the county was declared a disaster area due to damage from Hurricane Frederic, and again in September 2004 due to damage from Hurricane Ivan.
