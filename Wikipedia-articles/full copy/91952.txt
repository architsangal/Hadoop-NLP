[ Career in physics ] He is a graduate of Syosset High School, Syosset, New York. He graduated from Harvard University with a BA in physics, and from Cornell University with a PhD in theoretical particle physics. He was a junior fellow and taught in the physics department at Harvard University until 1990. { http://www.radcliffe.edu/fellowships/fellows_2009pginsparg.aspx } The pre-print archive was developed while he was a member of staff of Los Alamos National Laboratory, 1990 –2001. Since 2001, Ginsparg has been a professor of Physics and Computing &amp; Information Science at Cornell University. { http://www.physics.cornell.edu/people/faculty/?page=website/faculty &amp; action=show/id=17 } He has published physics papers in the areas of quantum field theory, string theory, conformal field theory, and quantum gravity. He often comments on the changing world of physics in the Information Age. { Phony Science: Questions for Paul Ginsparg William Speed Weed, 2002-10-13 } { &quot; The global-village pioneers &quot; by Paul Ginsparg, on the early days of the web, Physics World, October 1, 2008; see updated and augmented version &quot; It was twenty years ago today... &quot; (14 Aug 2011) } { Is Eternal Vigilance the Price of Freedom?
