Elizabeth Sinclair purchased Ni ihau in 1864 from the Kingdom of Hawaii and private ownership passed on to her descendants, the Robinson family. During World War II, the island was the site of the Ni ihau Incident : A Japanese fighter pilot crashed on the island and terrorized its residents for a week after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The people of Ni ihau are known for their gemlike &apos;&apos;lei pūpū&apos;&apos; (shell lei) craftsmanship, and speak Hawai ian as a primary language. The island is generally off-limits to all but relatives of the island&apos;s owners, U.S. Navy personnel, government officials and invited guests, giving it the nickname &quot; The Forbidden Isle &quot;. Beginning in 1987, a limited number of supervised activity tours and hunting safaris have opened to tourists. The island is currently managed by Bruce and Keith Robinson. [ Geography ] [ List of beaches in Niihau ] Ni ihau is located about [ 18 mi km ] west of Kaua i, and the tiny, uninhabited island of Lehua lies [ 0.7 mi nmi km ] north of Ni ihau. Ni ihau&apos;s dimensions are 6.2 miles by 18.6 miles (10  km x 30  km). The maximum elevation (Paniau) is [ 1280 ft m 0 ]. The island is about 4.9 million years old, making it geologically younger than the 5 million year old neighboring island of Kaua i to the northeast. [ Juvik Sonia P. James O. Juvik, Thomas R. Paradise Atlas of Hawaii University of Hawaii Press 1998 978-0-8248-2125-8 3–6 ] Ni ihau consists of one extinct volcano that had a large landslide to the east. [ Climate ] The island is relatively arid because it lies in the rain shadow of Kaua i, and lacks the elevation needed to catch significant amounts of trade wind rainfall. Ni ihau therefore, depends for its rain on winter Kona storm s, when more northerly weather systems intrude into the region. As such, the island is subject to long periods of drought. [ Tabrah 1987 10–11 ] {. } Historical droughts on Ni ihau have been recorded several times, one in 1792 by Captain James Cook &apos;s former junior officer, George Vancouver, who had been told that the people of Ni ihau had abandoned the island because of a severe drought and had moved to Kaua i to escape famine. [ Tabrah 1987 49 ] {. } [ Flora and fauna ] View of the rugged cliffs of windward Ni ihau (the northeastern shore) As an arid island, Ni ihau was barren of trees for centuries — Captain James Cook reported it treeless in 1778. Aubrey Robinson, grandfather of current owners Bruce and Keith Robinson, planted 10,000 trees per year during much of his ownership of the island; Robinson&apos;s afforestation efforts increased rainfall in the dry climate. Island co-owner Keith Robinson, a noted conservationist, preserved and documented many of Ni ihau&apos;s natural plant resources. The island is designated as a critical habitat for the ōlulu, an endemic and endangered species of Hawaiian lobelioid. Aylmer robinsonii, a Pritchardia palm tree named for Keith Robinson&apos;s uncle Aylmer Robinson, is an endangered species native to Ni ihau. Several bird species thrive on Ni ihau. Intermittent playa lakes on the island provide wetland habitats for the alae ke oke o (Hawaiian Coot), the āe o (Black-winged Stilt), and the koloa maoli (Hawaiian Duck). The critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi) is found in high numbers on Ni ihau&apos;s shores. Robinson states that Ni ihau&apos;s secluded shoreline offers them a safe haven from habitat encroachments. According to Robinson, conditions there are better than the government refuges of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. When the Robinsons originally purchased Ni ihau, no monk seals were present, because the Native Hawaiians had exterminated them to preserve fishing stocks. Big game herds, imported from stock on Moloka i Ranch in recent years, roam Ni ihau&apos;s forests and flatlands. Eland and aoudad are abundant, along with oryx es, wild boar s and feral sheep. These big game herds provide income from hunting safari tourism. [ History ] Map of Yam Bay and Ni ihau, Captain George Dixon&apos;s Journal, 1788. Prior to the unification of the Kingdom of Hawaii under Kamehameha I, Ni ihau was ruled by the ali i. Kahelelani was the first of the Ni ihau ali i. His name is now used to refer to the Ni ihau kahelelani, the puka shell of the wart turbans (Leptothyra verruca), used to make exquisite Ni ihau shell jewelry.

A stone wall ( Papohaku ) across a quarter of the island&apos;s southern end marked the boundaries of the two chiefs: Kā eo &apos;s land was identified by black stones and Kawaihoa&apos;s by white stones. Eventually, a great battle took place, known as Pali Kamakaui. Kā eo&apos;s two brothers from the island of Maui, Kaiana and his half-brother Kahekili, the King of Maui, fought for Kā eo and Ni ihau was united under his rule. Kawaihoa was banished to the south end of the island and Kā eo moved to the middle of the island to govern. Kā eo married the Queen Kamakahelei and a future king of Ni ihau and Kaua i named Kaumuali i was born in 1790. Kaua i and Ni ihau are said to have carried the &quot; highest blood lines &quot; in the Hawaiian Islands. [ Tava Keale 1998 13–14 ] {. } Kamehameha managed to unify all of the islands by 1795, except for Kaua i and Ni ihau: { Coulter, John Wesley. (Jun, 1964) &quot; Great Britain in Hawaii: The Captain Cook Monument &quot;. The Geographical Journal, Vol. 130, No. 2. } [ 10.2307/1794586 ] Two attempts to conquer those islands had failed, and Kamehameha lost many men: bodies covered the beaches on Kaua i&apos;s eastern shores. { Ihau } { Topgallant Publishing } { 1981 } { 0-914916-43-2 } { 17 } Finally, in 1810, Kamehameha amassed a great fleet, and Kaumuali i, the last independent ali i, surrendered rather than risk further bloodshed. Independence again became feasible after Kamehameha&apos;s death in 1819, but was put down when Kamehameha&apos;s widow Ka ahumanu kidnapped Kaumuali i and forced him to marry her. Thereafter Ni ihau remained part of the unified Kingdom of Hawai i. Ni ihau in 1885, photograph taken by Francis Sinclair, son of Elizabeth McHutchison Sinclair. Elizabeth McHutchison Sinclair (1800–1892) purchased Ni ihau and parts of Kaua i from Kamehameha V in 1864 for $10,000 in gold (the purchasing power of $10,000 USD in 1864 would be equivalent to $ [ US 10000 1864 ] today, not counting the fluctuating gold market). Sinclair chose Ni ihau over other options, including Waikīkī and Pearl Harbor. By around 1875, Ni ihau&apos;s population consisted of about 350 Native Hawaiians, with 20,000 sheep. [ Bird Isabella L. Isabella Bird The Hawaiian Archipelago BiblioBazaar 2006 http://books.google.com/?id%3Der-Y-eHjHpcC%26amp%3Blpg%3DPP1%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA212#v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D 1-4264-4990-9 212 ] This era marked the end of the art of Hawaiian mat –weaving made famous by the people of Ni ihau. Makaloa ( Cyperus laevigatus ), a native sedge, used to grow on the edges of Ni ihau&apos;s three intermittent lake s. [ Joesting Edward Kauai: The Separate Kingdom University of Hawaii 1988 0-8248-1162-3 188 ] The stems were harvested and used to weave moena makaloa (mats), considered the &quot; finest sleeping mats in Polynesia &quot;. The mats were valued by ali i and foreign visitors alike, but by the end of the 19th century, Hawaiians had stopped weaving makaloa due to changes in population, culture, economics, and the environment. [ Van Dyke Peter Growing Makaloa (Cyperus laevigatus L. ) in Constructed Wetlands for Weaving and Treating Wastewater Final report for U.S. Geological Survey Grant No. 99CRGR0003 Bishop Museum June, 2001 http://www.bishopmuseum.org/exhibits/greenwell/images/makaloa.pdf ] In 1915, Sinclair&apos;s grandson Aubrey Robinson closed the island to most visitors. Even relatives of the inhabitants could visit only by special permission. Upon Aubrey&apos;s death in 1939 the island passed to his son Aylmer, and in 1968 to Aylmer&apos;s youngest brother Lester. Upon Lester&apos;s wife Helen&apos;s death, the island passed to his sons Bruce and Keith Robinson, the current co-owners. (See Owners&apos; family tree ) Ni ihau played a small role during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. In what has come to be called the Ni ihau Incident, or the Battle of Ni ihau, [ August 2010 ] { The Ni ihau Incident serves as the backdrop for } { Caroline Paul &apos;s 2006 novel East Wind, Rain (ISBN 0-06-078075-4) and the opening chapter of } { Michelle Malkin &apos;s } { In Defense of Internment. } an off-course Japanese pilot crash-landed on the island and was captured by locals. The pilot escaped with the assistance of local Japanese residents, but was later recaptured and killed. Despite its self-imposed isolation, Ni ihau has a long-standing relationship with the U.S. military dating from 1924. There is a small Navy installation on the island. No military personnel are permanently stationed there, but the U.S. military has used the island for training special operations units, which included hiring Hawaiians that live on Ni&apos;ihau as &quot; enemy &quot; trackers. { Sommer, Anthony. &quot; Niihau: Opening Up. &quot; } { Honolulu Star-Bulletin. May 14, 1999. } [ Society ] [ Politics ] [ Politics of Hawaii ] The island of Ni ihau was considered as a possible location for the United Nations headquarters in 1944 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt had visited Hawai i in 1934. [ Tabrah 1987 1 ] {. } Under Cordell Hull, Roosevelt&apos;s Secretary of State, the State Department seriously studied the proposal. [ Bemis Samuel Flagg Samuel Flagg Bemis The Memoirs of Cordell Hull The Journal of Modern History 21 4 317–320 University of Chicago Press December 1949 10.1086/237294 ] In 2004 President George W.

Ni ihau has no telephone service and no automobiles. Horses are the main form of transportation; bicycles are also used. There are no power lines; solar power provides all electricity. Water comes from rainwater catchment. The Robinson family established most of these conditions. There is no hotel or general store; barges deliver groceries from Kaua i, often purchased by relatives, with free shipping. Residents speak the Hawaiian language, in part encouraged by terms in the original purchase contract which obligated the new owners to help preserve Hawaiian culture and tradition. The Ni ihau dialect differs from modern Hawaiian in that, for example, [ [t] ] and [ [ɾ] ] are the most common realizations of the phonemes [ /k/ ] and [ /l/ ]. Ni ihau is the only island where Hawaiian is spoken as a primary language; [ Olsen Eric P. Paradise Preserved World &amp; I 16 10 108 October 2001 108 ] Linguistic evidence and oral tradition maintain that the Ni ihau dialect is closer to the Hawaiian register spoken during the time of European contact. English is the second language. Residents have radio and television, although limited reception effectively limits the latter to watching VHS tapes and DVDs. [ http://archives.starbulletin.com/97/07/14/features/story3.html Niihau: Island at a Crossroad Catherine Kekoa Enomoto 1997 Honolulu Star-Bulletin ] In the past, the residents were not allowed to have newspapers, and most books were banned by the Robinsons. [ November 2011 ] Ni ihau is subject to regular droughts that occasionally force the population to evacuate to Kaua i temporarily, until rainfall replenishes their water supply. Residents commonly also commute to Kaua i for work, medical care, or school, and many of them call both islands home. To avoid a long boat ride, the island&apos;s owners maintain an Agusta A109 helicopter for emergencies and for transporting Navy contractors and residents to and from Kaua i. Helicopter tours and safaris help offset the costs of this service.

Ukulele and guitar playing is nearly ubiquitous among the islanders, and there are three separate styles of slack-key music, with an older style originating from Kohala.

At the Ke Kula Ni ihau o Kekaha school, students speak primarily the Ni ihau dialect through the early elementary grades, and then Hawai ian and English through grade 12. The school has a digital recording and video system, which helps to preserve and teach traditional Ni ihau and Hawaiian culture. At the other west Kaua i school, Kula Aupuni Ni ihau a Kahelelani Aloha (KANAKA), English is used in all grades, while still supporting the Ni ihau dialect. Both schools foster the culture, values, and spirituality of Ni ihau. [ Economy ] Approximately 80% of Ni ihau&apos;s income comes from a small Navy installation atop 1,300-foot-high cliffs. Remote-controlled tracking devices are used for testing and training with Kaua&apos;i&apos;s Pacific Missile Range Facility. Modern missile defense tests are conducted at the site for the U.S. and its allies. The installation brings in millions of dollars a year, and provides the island with a stable economic base without the complexity of tourism or industrial development. The sale of shells and shell jewelry is an additional source of income. [ Tava Keale 1998 36–37 ] {. } Its beaches are known for their pūpū, tiny shells that wash onto shore during winter months.

It had not been profitable for most of the 20th century. [ July 2009 ] Honey cultivation [ Tava Keale 1998 XV ] was also no longer viable by 1999. Kiawe charcoal was once a large-scale export, but aggressive Mexican price competition ended that as well. Mullet farming has been popular on Ni ihau, with ponds and lakes stocked with baby mullet, which reach [ 9 - 10 lb kg ] apiece before being harvested and sold on Kaua i and O ahu.

Depending on feasibility, impact, and ecological footprint on the ecosystem and culture, possibilities include: JP-4 or JP8 generation by the lignocellulose process; military, including a possible runway; and windmill energy production. Robinson has declined offers to purchase sand from Ni ihau&apos;s beaches, because of adverse environmental effects. [ Tourism ] Ni ihau&apos;s owners have offered half-day helicopter and beach tours of the island since 1987, [ Flying visitors can catch glimpse of &quot; The Forbidden Isle &quot; The Globe and Mail 1987-08-15 ] although contact with residents is avoided and no accommodations exist. { Niihau Island } Since 1992, [ Rodrigo Christine Safaris debut on Forbidden Island Pacific Business News 1992-04-06 ] hunting safari s provide income via tourists who pay to visit the island to hunt eland, aoudad, and oryx, as well as wild sheep and boar s.
