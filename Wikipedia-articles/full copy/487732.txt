Welker&apos;s next major character voice was for Marvin White, in the 1973 Hanna Barbera series Super Friends. He also provided the voice for Marvin&apos;s dog, Wonder Dog (which was inspired by Scooby-Doo). Welker would continue to provide voices for many other cartoon characters for the Hanna Barbera Company for several years. During the 1980s and 1990s, Welker became a very busy actor, providing the voice for many popular cartoon characters in multiple shows including the villainous Doctor Claw in Inspector Gadget, Mister Mxyzptlk and both Darkseid and Kalibak in Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, various G.I.

Welker performed as voice double for Leonard Nimoy in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, and provided voices for The Thing in 1986&apos;s The Golden Child, Sil in Species, and Malebolgia in 1997&apos;s Spawn. He has also created the vocal effects for different animals in films including the monkey Abu in Aladdin, its two sequels and the TV series adaptation, Arnold the Pig in the TV film Return to Green Acres, and most animals for Tiny Toon Adventures starting 1990 and ending in 1995, when the show had produced its final episode. In 2005, Welker became the new voice of Garfield, succeeding the original actor Lorenzo Music, who died in 2001 (Welker and Music had previously worked together in The Real Ghostbusters and the original Garfield and Friends ).

He voiced several Decepticon s, including the leader Megatron, Soundwave, Skywarp, Mixmaster, Laserbeak, Buzzsaw, Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, and Ratbat, as well as Autobot s Mirage, Trailbreaker, Chromedome and Sludge. With the release of The Transformers: The Movie animated film in 1986, he took on the role of the Autobot Wheelie and afterwards, took over the role of Galvatron (which coincidentally was voiced by his Star Trek III castmate Leonard Nimoy). Welker also returned to two of his Transformers roles when he portrayed Megatron and Soundwave as part of a spoof in the third season episode of Robot Chicken, aired shortly after the release of the live action film. In Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, he reprises the roles of Soundwave and Ravage, and also provides voices for Grindor, Devastator, and Reedman. He does not voice Megatron in any of the three live action films ( Hugo Weaving was chosen for the role, instead).
