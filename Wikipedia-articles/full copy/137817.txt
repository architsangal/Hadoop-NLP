[ 2 ] { GNIS feature ID } { 1500081 } [ 3 ] Yorktown is a census-designated place (CDP) in York County, Virginia, United States. The population was 220 in the 2000 census. It is the county seat of York County [ 6 ], one of the eight original shires formed in colonial Virginia in 1682. The town is most famous as the site of the siege and subsequent surrender of General Cornwallis to General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War on October 19, 1781. Although the war would last for another year, this British defeat at Yorktown effectively ended the war. Yorktown also figured prominently in the American Civil War (1861–1865), serving as a major port to supply both northern and southern towns, depending upon who held Yorktown at the time. Today, Yorktown is part of an important national resource known as the Historic Triangle of Yorktown, Jamestown and Williamsburg, and is the eastern terminus of the Colonial Parkway. Yorktown is also the eastern terminus of the TransAmerica Trail, a bicycle touring route created by the Adventure Cycling Association. [ History ] { Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781. (Painting by } { John Trumbull ) } Yorktown, named for the ancient city of York in Yorkshire, Northern England, was founded in 1691 as a port for shipping tobacco to Europe. The lawyer Thomas Ballard was the principal founder of the city along with Joseph Ring. { James Branch Cabell, The Majors and Their Marriages, pp. 58-59. } It was called &quot; York &quot; until after the American Revolutionary War, when the name &quot; Yorktown &quot; came into common use. { Genealogy of the Page family in... - Google Books } The town reached the height of its success around 1750 when it had 250 to 300 buildings and a population of almost 2,000 people. It was the base of British General Charles Cornwallis during the 1781 siege, which was the last major battle of the American Revolutionary War. Nine buildings, including the circa-1730 Nelson House, still survive from this period, as well as many of the earthworks dug by the besieging American and French forces. During the 1862 Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War (1861–1865), the town was captured from the Confederacy following the Siege and Battle of Yorktown and was then used as a base by the Union Army of the Potomac under General George B. McClellan. The Yorktown Victory Monument – commemorating the victoryolk, the alliance with France that brought it about and the resulting peace with England – is located just outside the current town. Designed by New York architect Richard Morris Hunt, the monument was originally topped by a figure of victory sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward, but that figure was destroyed by lightning in 1942. It was replaced by a figure of Liberty by Oskar J. W. Hansen in 1957. { Yorktown Victory Monument, Art Inventories Catalog, Smithsonian American Art Museum } A memorial to the French war dead of the Yorktown campaign is being planned for construction at the French cemetery on the site of the battle. { Yorktown Battlefield - French Army Casualties at Yorkown (U.S. National Park Service) } [ Geography ] { American Revolutionary War. Installed 1884. } Yorktown is situated along the York River in southeastern Virginia. Yorktown has several distinct areas. Yorktown Village or Historic Yorktown is set on the York River, near the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge that spans said river to reach Gloucester Point. Historic Yorktown is comprised first of a small strip along the beach of the York River, Water Street, which contains several small restaurants, a park, a hotel, a pier, and as of May 2005 completed a building project that has small shops and restaurants. Next, Main Street sits above Water Street on a bluff, around which the architecture is almost exclusively original. The old court house, several small shops, the Nelson House, and the Yorktown Monument all sit along this road. Around the center of the town are residential streets. Also, architecturally of note is Grace Episcopal Church, situated on Church Street near the old courthouse of Yorktown. Shops and eateries making up the &quot; Riverwalk &quot; section on the waterfront opened in May 2005. Colonial National Historical Park, which contains Yorktown National Battlefield and Yorktown National Cemetery, is located on the outskirts of the town. U.S. Route 17, also known as George Washington Memorial Highway, is the primary thoroughfare of Yorktown, and cuts past Yorktown by way of the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge across the York River. York County has grown rapidly, and over recent years, the stretch of U.S. 17 that passes through the area has grown from semi-rural highway going through mostly wooded areas to a heavily traveled route on which numerous strip malls and commercial areas are situated. Many of the residential areas of York County branch off of Route 17 or are near Interstate 64. Very little of the recent growth of York County has occurred close to Yorktown, which at this point is becoming much more of a historical colonial village, much like Williamsburg, under the guidance of the National Park Service. Geography makes Yorktown a strategic place in control of upstream portions of the York River and its tributaries and their access to the Chesapeake Bay. In his Notes on the State of Virginia published in 1781–82, Thomas Jefferson noted that the York River at Yorktown &quot; affords the best harbour in the state for vessels of the largest size. The river there narrows to the width of a mile, and is contained within very high banks, close under which the vessels may ride. &quot; { Notes on the State of Virginia } During World War I, the western shore above Yorktown became a location of choice for the U.S. Navy, as about [ 13000 acre km2 ], which straddled York, Warwick County and James City County were appropriated to create what was originally termed a &quot; naval mine depot &quot;. The Navy continues to use it 90 years later. { Naval Weapons Station Yorktown Celebrates 90 Years of Ordnance Support } The Somerwell House on Main Street. Many military installations are located in the area around Yorktown : Naval Weapons Station Yorktown serves as the point at which United States Navy vessels load and unload ordnance. There have been reports of nuclear weapon s stored there. Cheatham Annex, a facility which includes the former town of Penniman, is also included as part of the base, which replaced the original mine depot. United States Coast Guard Training Center Yorktown serves as a training school for the United States Coast Guard. Also close to Yorktown are Camp Peary (in York County), the expansive Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipbuilding yards and facilities, and Fort Eustis Army base (both in Newport News ) as well as Naval Station Norfolk at Norfolk and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton.
