[ Biography ] Auster was born in Newark, New Jersey, { Freeman, John. &quot; At home with Siri and Paul &quot;, } { The Jerusalem Post, April 3, 2008. Accessed September 19, 2008. &quot; Like so many people in New York, both of them are spiritual refugees of a sort.

Hadley Freeman meets a modernist with some very traditional views &quot;, } { The Guardian, October 26, 2002. Accessed September 19, 2008. &quot; Education: Columbia High School, New Jersey; 1965-69 Columbia College, New York; &apos;69-70 Columbia University, New York (quit after one year) &quot; } After graduating from Columbia University in 1970, he moved to Paris, France where he earned a living translating French literature. Since returning to the U.S. in 1974, he has published poems, essays, novels of his own, as well as translations of French writers such as Stéphane Mallarmé and Joseph Joubert. He and his second wife, writer Siri Hustvedt, were married in 1981, and they live in Brooklyn. Together they have one daughter, Sophie Auster. Previously, Auster was married to the acclaimed writer, Lydia Davis. They have one son together, Daniel Auster. He is also the vice-president of PEN American Center. In 2012, Auster was quoted as saying in an interview that he wouldn&apos;t visit Turkey to protest their treatment of journalists. The Turkish Prime-Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized Auster: &quot; As if we need you! Who cares if you come or not? &quot;. { Turkish PM criticises US writer Paul Auster over human rights comments, Guardian, 01.02.2012 } &quot; According to the latest numbers gathered by International PEN, there are nearly one hundred writers imprisoned in Turkey, not to speak of independent publishers such as Ragip Zarakolu, whose case is being closely watched by PEN Centers around the world &quot;, responded Auster. { Paul Auster Responds After Turkish Prime Minister Calls Him ‘an Ignorant Man’, The New York Times, 01.02.2012 } [ Writing ] { Shimon Peres with } { Salman Rushdie and Caro Llewellyn in 2008 } Following his acclaimed debut work, a memoir entitled The Invention of Solitude, Auster gained renown for a series of three loosely connected detective stories published collectively as The New York Trilogy. These books are not conventional detective stories organized around a mystery and a series of clues. Rather, he uses the detective form to address existential issues and questions of identity, space, language, and literature, creating his own distinctively postmodern (and critique of postmodernist) form in the process. Comparing the two works, Auster said, &quot; I believe the world is filled with strange events. Reality is a great deal more mysterious than we ever give it credit for. In that sense, the Trilogy grows directly out of The Invention of Solitude. &quot; { Mallia, Joseph. &quot; &quot; Paul Auster &quot;, &quot; } { BOMB Magazine &quot;, Spring, 1988. } The search for identity and personal meaning has permeated Auster&apos;s later publications, many of which concentrate heavily on the role of coincidence and random events ( The Music of Chance ) or increasingly, the relationships between people and their peers and environment ( The Book of Illusions, Moon Palace ). Auster&apos;s heroes often find themselves obliged to work as part of someone else&apos;s inscrutable and larger-than-life schemes. In 1995, Auster wrote and co-directed the films Smoke (which won him the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay ) and Blue in the Face. Auster&apos;s more recent works, Oracle Night (2003), The Brooklyn Follies (2005), and the novella Travels in the Scriptorium have also met critical acclaim. [ Themes ] According to a dissertation by Heiko Jakubzik at the University of Heidelberg, two central influences in Paul Auster&apos;s writing are Jacques Lacan&apos;s psychoanalysis and the American transcendentalism of the early to middle nineteenth century, exemplified by Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Lacan&apos;s theory declares that we enter the world through words. We observe the world through our senses, but the world we sense is structured (mediated) in our mind through language. Thus our subconscious also is structured as a language. This leaves us with a sense of anomaly. We can only perceive the world through language, but we have the feeling that something is missing. This is the sense of being outside language. The world can only be constructed through language, but it always leaves something uncovered, something that cannot be told or be thought of, it may only be sensed. This is one of the central themes of Paul Auster&apos;s writing. Lacan is considered to be one of the key figures of French poststructuralism. Some academics are keen to discern traces of other poststructuralist philosophers throughout Auster&apos;s oeuvre - mainly Jacques Derrida, Jean Baudrillard, and Michel de Certeau - although Auster has claimed to find such philosophies &apos;unreadable&apos;. The transcendentalists believe that the symbolic order of civilization separated us from the natural order of the world. By moving into nature - as Thoreau did in Walden - it would be possible to return to this natural order. The common factor of both ideas is the question of the meaning of symbols for human beings. { Heiko Jakubzik: Paul Auster und die Klassiker der American Renaissance. Dissertation, Universität Heidelberg 1999 ( online text ) } Auster&apos;s protagonists often are writers who establish meaning in their lives through writing and they try to find their place within the natural order, to be able to live within &quot; civilization &quot; again. Edgar Allan Poe, Samuel Beckett, and Herman Melville have also had a strong influence on Auster&apos;s writing. Not only do their characters reappear in Auster&apos;s work (such as William Wilson in City of Glass or Hawthorne&apos;s Fanshawe in The Locked Room, both from The New York Trilogy), Auster also uses variations on the themes of these writers. Paul Auster&apos;s reappearing subjects are: { Dennis Barone (ed.): Beyond the Red Notebook. Essays on Paul Auster. Penn Studies in Contemporary American Fiction. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia (2. ed. 1996) } coincidence frequent portrayal of an ascetic life a sense of imminent disaster an obsessive writer as central character or narrator loss of the ability to understand loss of language depiction of daily and ordinary life failure Dirk Peters: Das Motiv des Scheiterns in Paul Austers &quot; City of Glass &quot; und &quot; Music of Chance &quot;. unpublished MA dissertation, Christian-Albrechts Universität Kiel, 1998 absence of a father writing and story telling, metafiction intertextuality American history American space [ Coincidence ] Instances of coincidence may be found throughout Auster&apos;s work. [ April 2011 ] Auster claims that people are so influenced by the continuity among them that they do not see the elements of coincidence, inconsistency, and contradiction in their own lives: [ This idea of contrasts, contradictions, paradox, I think, gets very much to the heart of what novel writing is for me. It&apos;s a way for me to express my own contradictions. Paul Auster from Mark Irwin, &quot; Inventing the Music of Chance &quot; In: The Review of Contemporary Fiction Vol. XIV, no. 1 ] [ Failure ] Failure, in Paul Auster&apos;s works, is not just the opposite of the happy ending. In Moon Palace and The Book of Illusions it comes from the individual&apos;s uncertainty about the status of one&apos;s own identity. The protagonists start a search for their own identity and reduce their life to the absolute minimum. From this zero point they gain new strength and start their new life and they also are able to regain contact with their surroundings. A similar development also may be seen in City of Glass and The Music of Chance. Failure in this context is not the &quot; nothing &quot; - it is the beginning of something all new. [ Identity/Subjectivity ] Auster&apos;s protagonists often go through a process that reduces their support structure to an absolute minimum: they sever all contact with family and friends, go hungry, and lose or give away all their belongings. Out of this state of &quot; nothingness &quot; they either acquire new strength to reconnect with the world or they fail and disappear for good. [ center But in the end, he manages to resolve the question for himself - more or less. He finally comes to accept his own life, to understand that no matter how bewitched and haunted he is, he has to accept reality as it is, to tolerate the presence of ambiguity within himself.

(= Nordamerikastudien; 3) ISBN 3-593-35618-X ] [ Reception ] &quot; Over the past twenty-five years, &quot; opined Michael Dirda in The New York Review of Books in 2008, &quot; Paul Auster has established one of the most distinctive niches in contemporary literature. &quot; { Dirda 2008. } Dirda also has extolled his loaded virtues in The Washington Post : Ever since City of Glass, the first volume of his New York Trilogy, Auster has perfected a limpid, confessional style, then used it to set disoriented heroes in a seemingly familiar world gradually suffused with mounting uneasiness, vague menace and possible hallucination. His plots — drawing on elements from suspense stories, existential récit, and autobiography — keep readers turning the pages, but sometimes end by leaving them uncertain about what they&apos;ve just been through. { Dirda 2003. } Literary critic James Wood, however, offers Auster little praise in his piece &quot; Shallow Graves &quot; in the November 30, 2009, issue of The New Yorker : What Auster often gets instead is the worst of both worlds: fake realism and shallow skepticism. The two weaknesses are related. Auster is a compelling storyteller, but his stories are assertions rather than persuasions. They declare themselves; they hound the next revelation. Because nothing is persuasively assembled, the inevitable postmodern disassembly leaves one largely untouched. (The disassembly is also grindingly explicit, spelled out in billboard-size type.) Presence fails to turn into significant absence, because presence was not present enough. { Wood 2009, http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/11/30/091130crbo_books_wood?currentPage=1. } { John Ashbery at the } { Brooklyn Book Festival } [ Awards ] [ Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf American Academy of Arts and Sciences 16 April 2011 ] 1989 Prix France Culture de Littérature Étrangère for The New York Trilogy 1990 Morton Dauwen Zabel Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters 1991 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction finalist for The Music of Chance 1993 Prix Médicis Étranger for Leviathan 1996 Bodil Awards - Best American Film: Smoke 1996 Independent Spirit Award - Best First Screenplay: Smoke 1996 John William Corrington Award for Literary Excellence 2003 Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2006 Prince of Asturias Award for Literature (received in previous years by Günter Grass, Arthur Miller, and Mario Vargas Llosa ) 2006 Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters for Literature 2007 Honorary doctor from the University of Liège 2007 Commandeur de l&apos; Ordre des Arts et des Lettres &apos;&apos;Paul Auster décoré par la France à New York&apos;&apos; sur le site de France 3. 2010 Médaille Grand Vermeil de la ville de Paris &apos;&apos;Paul Auster décoré par Bertrand Delanoë&apos;&apos; from the website of L&apos;Express June 11 2010 [ Published works ] [ Fiction ] City of Glass (1985) Ghosts (1986) The Locked Room (1986) { In the Country of Last Things (1987) } { Moon Palace (1989) } { The Music of Chance (1990) } { Auggie Wren&apos;s Christmas Story (1990) } { Leviathan (1992) } { Mr. Vertigo (1994) } { Timbuktu (1999) } { The Book of Illusions (2002) } { Oracle Night (2003) } { The Brooklyn Follies (2005) } { Travels in the Scriptorium (2006) } { Man in the Dark (2008) Another Paul Auster novel, &apos;Man in the Dark&apos;, was due to be published by Henry Holt in the U.S. on Monday 1st September 2008. } { Invisible (2009) } { Sunset Park (2010) http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/innocence-of-youth-how-paul-auster-excavated-his-own-past-for-his-latest-novel-1811322.html } [ Poetry ] Disappearances: Selected Poems (1988) Ground Work: Selected Poems and Essays 1970-1979 (1991) Collected Poems (2007) [ Screenplays ] The Music of Chance (film) (1993) Smoke (1995) Blue in the Face (1995) Lulu on the Bridge (1998) The Inner Life of Martin Frost (2007) – &quot; The Inner Life of Martin Frost &quot; is a screenplay that is mentioned in Auster&apos;s novel The Book of Illusions.

In 2005 his daughter, Sophie, recorded an album of songs in both French and English, entitled Sophie Auster, with the band One Ring Zero. The lyrics of three of the songs (in English) are by Paul Auster; and he also provided for the accompanying booklet translations of several French poems which form the lyrics of other songs on the album. In 1993, a movie adaptation of The Music of Chance was released. Auster features in a cameo role at the end of the film. In 1994 City of Glass was adapted as a graphic novel by artist David Mazzucchelli and Paul Karasik. Auster&apos;s friend, noted cartoonist Art Spiegelman, produced the adaptation. Jazz trumpeter and composer Michael Mantler &apos;s album Hide and Seek uses words by Auster from the play of the same name. Paul Auster&apos;s voice may be heard on the 2005 album entitled We Must Be Losing It by The Farangs. The two tracks are entitled &quot; Obituary in the Present Tense &quot; and &quot; Between the Lines &quot;. In 2006 Paul Auster directed the film The Inner Life of Martin Frost, based on an original screenplay by him. It was shot in Lisbon and Azenhas do Mar and starred David Thewlis, Iréne Jacob, and Michael Imperioli as well as Auster&apos;s daughter Sophie. Auster provided the narration, albeit uncredited. The film premiered at the European Film Market, as part of the 2007 Berlinale in Berlin, Germany on February 10, 2007, and opened in New York City on September 7 of the same year. The lyrics of Fionn Regan &apos;s 2006 song Put A Penny In The Slot mention Auster and his novella Timbuktu. Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth &apos;s composition... ce qui arrive... (2004) combines the recorded voice of Paul Auster with ensemble music and live electronics by Markus Noisternig and Thomas Musil ( Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics (IEM) ). Paul Auster is heard reading from his books Hand to Mouth and The Red Notebook, either as straight recitation, integrated with other sounds as if in a radio play, or passed through an electronically realized string resonator so that the low tones interact with those of a string ensemble. A film by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster runs throughout the work featuring the cabaret artist and actress Georgette Dee.
