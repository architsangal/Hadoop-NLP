He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1993 for his play Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes and co-authored with Eric Roth the screenplay for the 2005 film Munich. [ Life and career ] { Columbia University in 1978 } Kushner was born in Manhattan, New York to Jewish clarinetist and conductor William Kushner and bassoonist Sylvia Deutscher. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana, the seat of Calcasieu Parish where he spent his childhood. During high school Kushner had a reputation in policy debate, at one point going to a camp, and making it to the final rounds. Kushner moved to New York in 1974 to begin his undergraduate college education at Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Medieval Studies in 1978. He attended New York University &apos;s Graduate Acting Program at the Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in 1984. [ NYU Graduate Acting Alumni http://gradacting.tisch.nyu.edu/object/ga_alumbios.html 2011 2011-12-01 ] During graduate school, he spent the summers of 1978-1981 directing both early original works (Masque of Owls and Incidents and Occurrences During the Travels of the Tailor Max) and plays by Shakespeare ( A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream and The Tempest ) for the children attending the Governor&apos;s Program for Gifted Children (GPGC) in Lake Charles. In 2008 Kushner received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters from SUNY Purchase College, and in May 2011 received an honorary doctorate from CUNY&apos;s John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Kushner&apos;s best known work is Angels in America (a play in two parts: Millennium Approaches and Perestroika), a seven-hour epic about the AIDS epidemic in Reagan-era New York, which was later adapted into a miniseries for which Kushner wrote the screenplay. His other plays include Hydriotaphia, Slavs!: Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness, A Bright Room Called Day, Homebody/Kabul, and the book for the musical Caroline, or Change. His new translation of Bertolt Brecht &apos;s Mother Courage and Her Children was performed at the Delacorte Theater in the summer of 2006 starring Meryl Streep and directed by George C. Wolfe. Kushner has also adapted Brecht&apos;s The Good Person of Szechwan, Corneille&apos;s The Illusion, and S. Ansky &apos;s play The Dybbuk. In the early 2000s, Kushner began writing for film. His co-written screenplay Munich was produced and directed by Steven Spielberg in 2005. In January 2006, a documentary feature about Kushner entitled Wrestling With Angels debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was directed by Freida Lee Mock. In April 2011 it was announced that he is currently working with Spielberg again, writing the screenplay for an adaptation of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin ‘s book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. [ Yin Maryann Steven Spielberg &amp; Tony Kushner To Adapt Team of Rivals http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/steven-spielberg-tony-kushner-to-adapt-team-of-rivals_b27796 5 May 2011 Mediabistro 14 May 2011 ] Kushner is famous for frequent revisions and years-long gestations of his plays. Both Angels in America: Perestroika and Homebody/Kabul were significantly revised even after they were first published. Kushner has admitted that the original script version of Angels in America: Perestroika is nearly double the length of the theatrical version. { Lucas, Craig. &quot; Tony Kushner &quot;, &quot; } { BOMB Magazine &quot;, Spring, 1993. Retrieved July 25, 2011. } His newest completed work, the play The Intelligent Homosexual&apos;s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures, began as a novel more than a decade ago. [ Political views ] Kushner&apos;s criticism of Israel &apos;s treatment of the Palestinians and of the increased religious extremism in Israeli politics and culture has created some controversy in the American Jewish community, including some opposition to his receiving an honorary doctorate at the 2006 commencement of Brandeis University. The Zionist Organization of America unsuccessfully lobbied the university to rescind its invitation to Kushner. { Angels in America } During the controversy, quotes critical of Zionism and Israel made by Kushner were circulated. Kushner said at the time that his quotes were &quot; grossly mischaracterized. &quot; Kushner told the Jewish Advocate in an interview, &quot; All that anybody seems to be reading is a couple of right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am. &quot; { Shayndi Raice. &quot; Brandeis graduation honoree draws fire. &quot; The Jewish Advocate. May 4, 2006. } In an interview with the Jewish Independent, Kushner commented, &quot; I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I&apos;ve always said that. I&apos;ve never said anything else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I&apos;m for a one-state solution, which is not true. &quot; However, he later stated that he hopes that &quot; there might be a merging of the two countries because [they&apos;re] geographically kind of ridiculous looking on a map, &quot; although he acknowledged that political realities make this unlikely in the near future.
