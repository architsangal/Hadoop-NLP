Created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita, Sr., the character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #41 (Oct. 1966). Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the Rhino has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as animated television series, arcade and video game s, and merchandise such as action figure s and trading card s. [ Publication history ] [ Origin ] Described by writer Mike Conroy as &quot; Famously one of Spider-Man&apos;s dimmest villains &quot;, { Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins &amp; Brown, 2004. } the character debuted in Amazing Spider-Man #41 - 43 (Oct. - Dec. 1966) as a nameless thug for hire working for an Eastern Bloc country. He volunteered to participate in an experiment that bonded a super strong polymer to his skin, thus augmenting his strength and speed, resulting in the Rhino alias. The Rhino returned in Hulk, vol. 2, #104 (June 1968) and although he died at the end of the story, the character proved popular enough to be revived, becoming a perennial opponent for both Spider-Man and the Hulk. The character achieved significant exposure in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing in both a solo capacity and as a villain for hire in over a dozen titles. Significant appearances included starring in the limited series Deadly Foes of Spider-Man #1 - 4 (May - Aug. 1991); the Flowers for Rhino storyline in Spider-Man&apos;s Tangled Web # 5 - 6 (Oct. - Nov. 2001) which is told from the character&apos;s perspective, and Punisher War Journal vol. 2, #13 - 15 (Jan. - Mar. 2008), in which the Rhino begins to rethink his lifestyle. In Amazing Spider-Man #617 (March 2010), a now reformed Sytsevich aids Spider-Man against a new version of the character after Sytsevich turned down Doctor Trama&apos;s offer to give him a new Rhino armor. This caused Doctor Trauma to give the offer to an unnamed human. [ Fictional character biography ] After being empowered, Aleksei Sytsevich is directed by the agents who gave him his powers to kidnap Colonel John Jameson for his knowledge of military secrets. The Rhino, however, betrays the scientists who empowered him and goes on a rampage, eventually being defeated by the superhero Spider-Man. He is imprisoned and kept there with sedation, but breaks out soon after and continues to try to kidnap Jameson. Spider-Man uses a web developed by Conner that melts his hide off, then knocks him out. { The Amazing Spider-Man #41 - 43 (Oct. - Dec. 1966) } Eventually approached by the same scientists with another more powerful suit, the Rhino agrees to find and kidnap Bruce Banner (the alter ego of the Hulk), for his knowledge of gamma radiation. The villain encounters the Hulk but is apparently killed by severe wound s from an exploding truck before a significant battle can occur. The Hulk manages to survive the Rhino&apos;s attempt to take his foe down with him, using his last bit of strength for an attack from behind, and the villain passes out in the Hulk&apos;s grip, defiantly claiming that he would have defeated the Hulk in a fair fight. { Hulk vol. 2, #104 (June 1968) } The character is revived and healed by another Hulk foe, the Leader. Augmenting the Rhino&apos;s strength using gamma rays, the Leader directs the villain to prevent the wedding of Bruce Banner to Betty Ross. Banner becomes the Hulk and battles the Rhino, who escapes and pursues the Leader once realizing that he has been used. The Rhino is caught in an explosion while attacking the Leader&apos;s ship, and is left in a coma. { Hulk vol. 2, #124 (Feb 1970) } The Rhino makes a brief reappearance as an illusion when the Leader tries to unsuccessfully torture the Hulk with images of past foes. { Hulk vol. 2, #139 (May 1970) } The Leader, paralyzed after a previous encounter with the Hulk, finds and takes mental control of the still comatose body and attacks the Hulk. The battle eventually leads to an alien world, where the Leader abandons control of the Rhino and flees. Bruce Banner and an unconscious but now recovered Rhino travel back to Earth via a rocket. { Hulk vol. 2, #157 - 159 (Nov. 1972- Jan 1973) } The Rhino reappears with fellow Hulk foe the Abomination, and the pair activate a gamma bomb at the Hulkbuster base in an attempt to destroy the Hulk. The Hulk&apos;s companion of the time, Jim Wilson, deactivates the bomb and the Hulk tricks the villains during combat, forcing them to collide and knock each other unconscious. { Hulk vol. 2, #171 (Jan. 1974) } The character reappears as a member of the supervillain team the Emissaries of Evil (consisting of leader Egghead; the Cobalt Man; Solarr and the Rhino), who search for a rare jewel.

Based on the Daniel Keyes novel Flowers for Algernon, the comic story mirrors the original when the Rhino receives an intelligence boost via surgery and becomes a genius, eventually undergoing surgery again to reverse the process when life becomes dull. { Spider-Man&apos;s Tangled Web #5-6 (Oct. - Nov. 2001) } The Rhino has a comical encounter with the mercenary Deadpool ending with the Rhino&apos;s defeat by a diminutive (courtesy of the Pym Particles discovered by Henry Pym ) Deadpool; { Cable &amp; Deadpool #36 - 37 (March - April 2007), } Rhino appears during the Civil War storyline where he assists Chameleon into attacking Spider-Man. { Civil War: Peter Parker Spider-Man #1 (Dec. 2007) } The character also has a significant encounter with the vigilante the Punisher. When the Rhino robs a bank and a Security Guard is accidentally killed, he is humiliated by the Punisher and saved by Spider-Man before being killed. The Rhino is then captured by Alyosha Kravinoff, the son of another former Spider-Man foe, Kraven the Hunter. Kravinoff, who is collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans, is defeated by the Punisher, with a despondent Rhino and other villains being freed. { Punisher War Journal vol. 2, #13 - 15 (Jan. - March 2008) } Rhino, feeling remorse from the accidental killing, does send a letter and money to the security guard&apos;s widow. [ November 2010 ] The Rhino reappears and decides to make amends and repay the Punisher for the previous rescue by aiding him on a case. At the conclusion of the story the Rhino is allowed to leave and told to &quot; be good &quot;, { Punisher War Journal #23 vol. 2, #23 (Nov. 2008) } eventually returning to aid the vigilante. { Punisher War Journal Annual #1 (Dec. 2008) } Rhino later persuaded Punisher to not kill Michael Watts who became the third Stilt-Man. { Punisher War Journal Vol 2. #26 } During The Gauntlet storyline, Rhino later decided to give up his life entirely. He surrendered to the police, and pled guilty to all charges against him. S.H.I.E.L.D. (painfully) removed his Rhino costume, and he was sentenced to twenty-five years in Ryker&apos;s Island. The Russian Mafia and other criminal gangs tried to recruit him, but he denied them all, even going so far as to completely avoid a break-out at one point. For his good behavior and cooperation, he was released early on parole, &quot; in order to make room for worse guys &quot;. His first stop after getting off the bus was a diner where the waitress Oksana was somewhat mean/nice to him because she knew he was an ex-con as that&apos;s all that ever comes in. He paid for his meal and left. He then rents a room at Vasili&apos;s, and is met by a Doctor Trauma, who wants to re-invent him as an all-new and improved Rhino. When he noticed Oksana in Vasili&apos;s restaurant crying, he walked over to her to talk to her and discovered she had been fired for being mean to the customers. Aleksei declined Doctor Trauma&apos;s offer and asked Oksana to have dinner with him. They eventually got married and live in a small apartment in Yonkers. Doctor Trauma eventually found someone else and a new and improved Rhino came after Aleksei feeling that he had to destroy the old Rhino if he was going to ascend. Aleksei feels he needs to face and kill the new Rhino to get rid of him but Spider-Man convinces him to promise otherwise and helps Aleksei keep his new life by defeating the new Rhino. { Amazing Spider-Man #617 (March 2010) } The New Rhino attacks Aleksei at one of J. Jonah Jameson&apos;s press meetings. Feeling he could not break this promise to Spider-Man, Aleksei lies to the New Rhino, telling him he will agree to fight him in his suit but he instead goes in hiding with Oksana. However before they arrive at their safehouse the New Rhino attacks again; Oksana dies as a result. Aleksei redons his old Rhino suit and charges at the New Rhino who in return charges at Aleksei. They collide sending Spider-Man and Norah into the air. With one hit Aleksei completely totaled the New Rhino&apos;s suit. Spider-Man begs Aleksei to stop now that the New Rhino&apos;s suit was destroyed. Furious at Spider-Man for preventing him from stopping the New Rhino earlier, Rhino responds &quot; All of this happened because I pretended to be something I am not. I will never forgive you. &quot; He then charges at the pleading and helpless New Rhino killing him. Spider-Man and Norah leave sorrowfully as Norah states that not only is the New Rhino dead, but the man Aleksei Sytsevich is as well. { Amazing Spider-Man #625 (March 2010) } During the &quot; Origin of the Species &quot; storyline, Rhino is invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team where he becomes involved in securing some specific items for him. He showed up after Spider-Man made Freak collide with Vulture IV. Notably, Rhino is revealed to be going after Spider-Man himself rather than the infant. Having realized this, Spider-Man talks him down from a fight because the potential death of an infant would be on Rhino&apos;s hands. Spider-Man apologizes for Oksana&apos;s death and questions if killing a baby would make her proud of Rhino. Rhino elects not to attack Spider-Man but warns him that next time they meet, he will kill Spider-Man. { Amazing Spider-Man #644 } Rhino was soon thereafter seen as a member of Doctor Octopus&apos; Sinister Six. { Amazing Spider-Man #648 } During the Ends of the Earth storyline, Rhino was with the Sinister Six when Spider-Man and the Avengers caught up to them on the Mediterranean Coasts. Rhino manages to defeat Thor after he had sent Electro into the atmosphere. { The Amazing Spider-Man #683 } Rhino was seen guarding one of Doctor Octopus&apos; facilities in Korea. He fights Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable and is defeated by Spider-Man&apos;s electrical webbing. { The Amazing Spider-Man #685 } [ Powers and abilities ] The character possesses a thick polymer mat suit similar to a rhinoceros hide, covering his entire body except for his face. The suit is highly impervious to damage and temperature extremes, and is also equipped with a horn. Mutagenic chemical and radiation treatments, including gamma ray bombardment, provides the character with superhuman strength, heightened levels of speed and stamina, and a high degree of durability. The second Rhino wears a high-tech armor and wields a battle-axe with its blades in the shape of a rhinoceros&apos; horns. [ Other versions ] [ Age of Apocalypse ] In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Rhino was one of Death&apos;s soldiers on the Moon at Apocalypse&apos;s recovery base the Ship. Death captured super humans and brought them to the Ship and used the Terrigen Mist to turn them into warped powerful monsters for him to control. Rhino was one of the super humans that were captured. He joined Death and other of his henchmen and fought Magneto and the X-Men on the moon. He ends up fighting Rogue but is defeated easily by one punch. { Age of Apocalypse #4 } [ Earth-Charnel ] Rhino was seen as a member of the Avengers who traveled through time to stop Charnel, an entity that had been ravaging his future-Earth for decades. He had been partenered with She-Hulk for twenty years. He was killed in action. { Death&apos;s Head 2 #4 (1992) } [ JLA/Avengers ] Rhino is among the villains enthralled by Krona in the last issue to defend his stronghold. He is shown defeating Triathlon. { JLA/Avengers #3 } [ House of M ] In the House of M reality, Rhino is the bodyguard of Peter Parker.

Rhino betrays the Green Goblin enlisting his friends Electro, Ox and Vulture to attack the Green Goblin, unmasking him to reveal Peter Parker. { Spider-Man: House of M #1-3 } [ Marvel Zombies ] Rhino was among the zombified villains that attempted to devour Galactus. When the other zombies were done eating Galactus, Hulk tore off Rhino&apos;s head and ate it stating that it did not taste good. { Marvel Zombies #3 } [ MC2 ] Rhino appeared within the MC2 Universe in the pages of Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man. Whilst visiting the hospital with his sick aunt, Rhino briefly loses his temper as he is told to fill in his forms in order for his aunt to receive her meds, before calming down. Waiting in line, he once again comes face to face with Peter Parker, who is with his own family. Remembering that he once threatened Peter under the orders of Harry Osborn, Rhino assures Peter what he did was simply business, and the two call a truce. They spend the remainder of Peter&apos;s visit exchanging stories of their lifestyle choices, and part with a better understanding of each other. { Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man #1 } [ Ultimate Rhino ] Ultimate Rhino (R.H.I.N.O.) has increased power from the suit that Alex O&apos;Hirn stole from the U.S. Military. { Ultimate Spider-Man #123 } Using the R.H.I.N.O. suit&apos;s incredible strength, Alex O&apos;Hirn robbed a Manhattan bank, charging the vault head-first, destroying it. He then rampaged through a busy street to make his escape, destroying anything in his path, including police cars, with ease. Spider-Man tries to escape school in order to confront him but is stopped by various incidents. Iron Man arrives, stops the R.H.I.N.O.&apos;s assault, and captures him by the time Spider-Man catches up. The Rhino was then taken into military custody. { Ultimate Spider-Man #28 } He was last seen being soundly defeated by Spider-Man. { Ultimate Spider-Man Annual #1 } [ In other media ] [ Television ] The Rhino made two appearances in the first season of the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon voiced by Ed McNamera. In the episode &quot; Horn of the Rhino, &quot; Rhino steals some military equipment to try to make an explosive weapon which Spider-Man is blamed for, but Spider-Man realizes he is hiding in the rhinoceros enclosure of a zoo. The Rhino is defeated with pepper and Spider-Man baking some mud with a heating device. In the episode &quot; The Golden Rhino, &quot; Rhino steals a shipment of gold in order to make a gold statue of himself, which he succeeds in after stealing more gold, but is captured by Spider-Man&apos;s new webbing: instant steel. He later &quot; returned &quot; in a third-season budget-saving &quot; mishmash &quot; episode called &quot; Rhino &quot; which uses footage from his other episodes and where he also attempts to make a gold statue of himself, but is again webbed up. Rhino appears several times in Spider-Man: The Animated Series voiced by Don Stark. His origin is not detailed in the series, but he still retains his abilities from the comics. He first appears in the episode &quot; The Alien Costume &quot; where he is hired by the Kingpin to steal a mineral from John Jameson&apos;s space shuttle after crash landing to earth, and then later on becomes a member of the Insidious Six. Here he is shown as very unintelligent, and in one episode Spider-Man easily fools him into thinking he is the Chameleon and tricks him into attacking other members of the Insidious Six. { The Spectacular Spider-Man.&apos;&apos; } Rhino appeared in The Spectacular Spider-Man voiced by Clancy Brown. Originally a common petty crook under Big Man, O&apos;Hirn was partnered with Flint Marko, and (briefly) Shocker. The two friends had repeated run-ins with Spider-Man and were getting frustrated at constantly being dupes and punching bag s. Eventually realizing Spider-Man must be made to get out of his way, Big Man had O&apos;Hirn used as a guinea pig in Oscorp&apos;s illegal experiments. His body was infused with Otto Octavius &apos; newest innovation: highly durable titanium resin armor modeled after a rhinoceros. O&apos;Hirn gleefully dubbed himself &quot; The Rhino &quot;. In comparison to Flint, O&apos;Hirn has no issue with his new found abilities as long as he could take down Spider-Man. However, his costume has one fatal flaw: it obstructs his pores. Without a proper hydration system, Rhino must periodically stop fighting and drink water, lest he overheat. Thus, Spider-Man gained the advantage by realizing and attacking this weakness (after Rhino proved immune to every other form of attack) by leading O&apos;Hirn into a steam tunnel and opening up the pipes. Suffering from heat exhaustion and severely delusional, O&apos;Hirn gives Spider-Man The Big Man&apos;s real name just before passing out. A second weakness of the costume is Rhino&apos;s trouble at manipulating small objects (such as elevator buttons). However, O&apos;Hirn is humble enough to acknowledge these shortcomings. In &quot; Group Therapy &quot;, he escapes from Ryker&apos;s Island with Doc Ock, Shocker, Fancy Dan and Ox, Sandman, Vulture and Electro; all the villains team up to take down Spider-Man as (the Daily Bugle dubs them) the Sinister Six, where he rekindles his partnership with Flint Marko, who has now become Sandman. Despite scaring Spider-Man away during a confrontation (with Rhino ready to impale him), he is defeated by a symbiote-controlled Spider-Man, when he is accidentally hit at the same time by Shocker and Electro, causing him to pass out while standing, and thrown on top of Electro. In &quot; Reinforcement, &quot; Rhino is once again a member of the Sinister Six that was organized by Master Planner and having Mysterio and Kraven the Hunter replacing Doctor Octopus and Shocker. Following the first wave of attackers, the Rhino challenges Spider-Man alongside Marko. The two are far too much for Spider-Man to out-fight, but Spider-Man defeats the Rhino by luring him onto thin ice with an air tank. Due to his weight he breaks through the ice and becomes trapped at the bottom of the bay yet is able to breathe due to the tank (before he sinks, he says to Spider-Man: &quot; I hate you. So much. &quot; ). Tinkerer manages to extract him at the last minute. In &quot; Accomplices, &quot; Doctor Octopus sends him to destroy a chip that contained info on creating more Rhinos. Spider-Man and Rhino had to team up to fend off Silver Sable and Hammerhead. Afterwards, Rhino attacked Spider-Man only to be knocked out by knock-out rockets launched by the cops. In &quot; Opening Night, &quot; Rhino is shown as an inmate at the Vault. [ Video games ] The Rhino&apos;s first video game appearance was in the 1989 game Doctor Doom&apos;s Revenge, along with other Marvel villains such as Electro, Batroc the Leaper, and Doctor Doom himself. The Rhino appears as a boss in The Amazing Spider-Man for the Game Boy. The Rhino makes an appearance in Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade&apos;s Revenge. He and Carnage team up to defeat Spider-Man at the end of his second level. Rhino appears as a boss in The Incredible Hulk for the SNES, Sega Genesis, SMS, and Sega Game Gear. In the PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Nintendo 64 Spider-Man game, the Rhino attacks both Spider-Man and the Black Cat. Spider-Man uses the surrounding machinery in his battle. He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. Rhino appears as a boss in the Game Boy Advance game Spider-Man: Mysterio&apos;s Menace. Rhino appears briefly in the Spider-Man 2 video game, voiced by John DiMaggio. The player briefly engages in a &quot; Boss Battle &quot; with him. This game&apos;s version of the Rhino has spikes on parts of his costume. In the PC version of Spider-Man 2, the Rhino is the first villain Spider-Man battles in the game. In the first battle, the Rhino escapes his maximum security prison after Spider-Man takes out numerous crooks. Later on in the game, Spider-Man and Rhino meet multiple times in OsCorp. In the PC Game, after Spider-Man defeats several crooks trying to make a jail break at the Maximum Security Prison in New York, Rhino breaks out and starts a fight with Spider-Man. Rhino then makes a run for it and is caught in a laser cage made by the police. Spider-Man engages Rhino in the cage and makes him smash into the cage until its power wears down. Rhino eventually gets through the cage completely after Spider-Man dodges him once more, but the villain is defeated when he rams a pole into a gas station that blows up and sends Rhino flying away from the blast. Rhino&apos;s unconscious body is taken by Doctor Octopus, leaving Spider-Man to take down the fire with fire hydrants. Rhino is later seen again in the game when Doctor Octopus attacks OsCorp, and Spider-Man has to fight Rhino in a generator room, defeating him by making him smash into six generators that electrocute him into submission. However, Rhino meets up with Spider-Man again in a small room with four tubes containing (what seems to be) liquid nitrogen. Evading Rhino, Spider-Man destroys the tubes and escapes the room as it freezes leaving Rhino frozen in the chamber. Ultimate Rhino is a boss Spider-Man fights in the 2005 Ultimate Spider-Man game, voiced by Bob Glouberman. When he first appeared, Spider-Man attempts to chase him while he causes destruction on the way. When he goes into a car lot, Spider-Man attempts to take him down by hitting him on his back multiple times. After Spidey defeated him, he was revealed to be a short man. He speaks mostly in Latin, seems to be very smart, and works for Bolivar Trask, a greedy business man who funded the Venom project. Strangely, this makes him the exact opposite of the original Rhino. In the characters page, R.H.I.N.O.&apos;s name is shown to be Alex O&apos;Hirn, and the web site for the game reveals that he originally designed the armor to be controlled by a computer before concluding that his own mind was more powerful than any computer and using the suit for himself. Rhino appears as a boss in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Steven Blum. He is a member of Doctor Doom &apos;s Masters of Evil. He and Shocker were first seen working with Arcade. They are later seen guarding a defeated Heimdall. Rhino has special dialogue with Thing and Venom. He is in Thing &apos;s simulation disk which takes place on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Omega Base where Thing must protect a frozen Mister Fantastic. John DiMaggio reprises his role of Rhino in Spider-Man: Friend or Foe. In the game, Rhino was one of the many villains that Mysterio kidnapped and placed under his control. He was sent to Tangaroa Island to guard a meteor shard. After Spider-Man defeats him and frees him of the Control Amulet, Rhino agrees to help Spider-Man and becomes a playable character. Steven Blum voices Rhino, who appears in the &apos;&apos;Spider-Man 3&apos;&apos; video game. Dr. Stillwell hires Rhino to take out Scorpion. After Rhino defeated Scorpion, he runs off. When Spider-Man and Scorpion reach Dr. Stillwell &apos;s hideout, Stillwell orders Rhino to destroy them. Rhino defeats Scorpion again, but Spider-Man defeats Rhino by tying him up with web lines and dropping several enormous ceiling blocks on top of him, knocking him unconscious. This version of Rhino does not don a full costume, but rather a large part of his body is scaly and bumpy like that of a rhinoceros, while his mask resembles that of his traditional costume. Rhino appeared in Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. Spider-Man encounters him on Ryker&apos;s Island when on his mission to break out the Tinkerer. Unlike his other incarnations, he actually aids Spider-Man (he is needed to break certain obstacles in the level), though he still presents some danger because he will sometimes launch indiscriminate attacks that can hurt the enemies in the level and Spider-Man. With Rhino&apos;s help, Spider-Man manages to take down the security system. If the player chooses the Red Suit path, Spider-Man tricks Rhino into going back the way they came in order to get himself captured again. If the player chooses the Black Suit Path, Spider-Man lets Rhino go through the exit and tells him to look for any flying super-powered characters stating to Rhino that he will need his help later. In the PlayStation 2 and PSP version, Rhino serves as a guard for Spencer Smythe &apos;s underground laboratory. Rhino appears exclusively in the Nintendo DS version of Spider-Man: Edge of Time. http://imageshack.us/f/171/spideyeot2.jpg/ Rhino will be one of the villains in The Amazing Spider-Man video game. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-7qN9cohSU &amp; feature=g-all-u &amp; context=G221c7d5FAAAAAAAAAAA This version of Aleksei Sytsevich is a low-level thug that a corrupt Oscorp executive and a reluctant Dr. Michael Morbius used a serum on that was created using the notes of Dr. Curt Connors&apos; research. The result of the serum used on Aleksei Sytsevich transforms him into a hybrid of a man and a rhinoceros. http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2012/02/24/the-rhino-crashes-into-activisions-upcoming-the-amazing-spider-man/ [ Novels ] The Rhino appears in Jim Butcher &apos;s Spider-Man novel The Darkest Hours, in which he and Spider-Man are forced to ally against the family of Morlun, and the two old foes gain a deeper respect for one another. Indeed, listening to Aleksei&apos;s life story, Peter finds out that the two of them are not all that different and have had many of the same problems in life. Also, Rhino points out that he hates his costume, but must wear it because it&apos;s what his clients expect. [ Toys and collectibles ] The Rhino has been reproduced in action figure form several times by Toy Biz, first as part of their Spider-Man: The Animated Series line, then as part of Spider-Man Classics, and finally as part of their Marvel Legends series. The Spider-Man Classics figure was later repainted and reissued by Hasbro. The character has been reproduced in mini-bust form by Art Asylum (as part of their Rogues Gallery collection) and as both a bust and statue by Bowen Designs. Rhino has also been immortalized as a comiquette statue by Sideshow Collectibles.
