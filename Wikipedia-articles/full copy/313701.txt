Since &quot; psychohistory &quot; in Asimov&apos;s sense of the word does not exist, Krugman turned to economics, which he considered the next best thing. { Interview, U.S. Economist Krugman Wins Nobel Prize in Economics &quot; PBS, Jim Lehrer News Hour &quot;, October 13, 2008, transcript Retrieved October 14, 2008 } { The New York Times, August 6, 2009, &quot; Up Front: Paul Krugman &quot; } Krugman&apos;s first wife was award-winning designer/artist Robin L.

[ Academic career ] Krugman giving a lecture at the German National Library in Frankfurt in 2008. Krugman earned his B.A. in economics from Yale University summa cum laude in 1974 and his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1977. While at MIT he was part of a small group of MIT students sent to work for the Central Bank of Portugal for three months in summer 1976, in the chaotic aftermath of the Carnation Revolution. From 1982 to 1983, he spent a year working at the Reagan White House as a staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers. He taught at Yale University, MIT, UC Berkeley, the London School of Economics, and Stanford University before joining Princeton University in 2000 as professor of economics and international affairs. He is also currently a centenary professor at the London School of Economics, and a member of the Group of Thirty international economic body. He has been a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research since 1979. Most recently, Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association. Paul Krugman has written extensively on international economics, including international trade, economic geography, and international finance. The Research Papers in Economics project ranked him as the 14th most influential economist in the world as of March 2011 based on his academic contributions. [ http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html Economist Rankings at IDEAS – Top 10% Authors, as of March 2012 March 2012 Research Papers in Economics April 29, 2012 ] Krugman&apos;s International Economics: Theory and Policy, co-authored with Maurice Obstfeld, is a standard undergraduate textbook on international economics. { &quot; Sources of international friction and cooperation in high-technology development and trade. &quot; National Academies Press, 1996, p. 190 } He is also co-author, with Robin Wells, of an undergraduate economics text which he says was strongly inspired by the first edition of Paul Samuelson &apos;s classic textbook. [ Paul Krugman Paul Samuelson, RIP Dec 13, 2009 New York Times 2011-12-11 One of the things Robin Wells and I did when writing our principles of economics textbook was to acquire and study a copy of the original, 1948 edition of Samuelson’s textbook. ] Krugman also writes on economic topics for the general public, sometimes on international economic topics but also on income distribution and public policy. The Nobel Prize Committee stated that Krugman&apos;s main contribution is his analysis of the impact of economies of scale, combined with the assumption that consumers appreciate diversity, on international trade and on the location of economic activity. { Nobel Prize Committee, &quot; The Prize in Economic Sciences 2008 &quot; } The importance of spatial issues in economics has been enhanced by Krugman&apos;s ability to popularize this complicated theory with the help of easy-to-read books and state-of-the-art syntheses. &quot; Krugman was beyond doubt the key player in &apos;placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream&apos;... and in conferring it the central role it now assumes. &quot; In 1978, Krugman wrote The Theory of Interstellar Trade, a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light. He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was &quot; an oppressed assistant professor &quot;. { Paul Krugman, March 11, 2008, The New York Times blog, &quot; Economics: the final frontier &quot; } [ New trade theory ] Prior to Krugman&apos;s work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Hecksher-Ohlin model ) emphasized trade based on the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as a country with a high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever larger share of trade occurred between countries with very similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman&apos;s explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. { &apos;&apos;Forbes&apos;&apos;, Oct. 13, 2008, Arving Panagiriya. } Consumers&apos; preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. { Note: Krugman modeled a &apos;preference for diversity&apos; by assuming a } { CES utility function like that in } { Avinash Dixit and } { Joseph Stiglitz (1977), &apos;Monopolistic competition and optimal product diversity&apos;, American Economic Review 67. } But because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvo s all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products. Many models of international trade now follow Krugman&apos;s lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption. This way of modeling trade has come to be called New Trade Theory. Krugman&apos;s theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the &quot; home market effect &quot;, which would later feature in his work on the new economic geography. The home market effect &quot; states that, ceteris paribus, the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net exporter of it. &quot; The home market effect was an unexpected result, and Krugman initially questioned it, but ultimately concluded that the mathematics of the model were correct. When there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become &apos; locked in &apos; to disadvantageous patterns of trade. { P. Krugman (1981), &apos;Trade, accumulation, and uneven development&apos;, Journal of Development Economics 8, pp. 149-61. } Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms. { &quot; Bold strokes: a strong economic stylist wins the Nobel &quot;, } { The Economist, October 16, 2008. } Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization. { (He writes on p. xxvi of his book The Great Unraveling that &quot; I still have the angry letter } { Ralph Nader sent me when I criticized his attacks on globalization. &quot; ) } He has also been critical of industrial policy, which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations rent-seeking advantages if &quot; strategic industries &quot; can be identified, saying it&apos;s not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter. { Strategic trade policy and the new international economics, Paul R. Krugman (ed), The MIT Press, p.18, ISBN 978-0-262-61045-2 } [ New economic geography ] It took an interval of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman&apos;s work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged to what is usually called the &quot; new economic geography &quot; (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper in the Journal of Political Economy. { &quot; Honoring Paul Krugman &quot; Economix blog of The New York Times, Edward Glaeser, October 13, 2008. } In Krugman&apos;s own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was &quot; obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took me a while to see it.... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying on the sidewalk in the interim. &quot; { Krugman (1999) &quot; Was it all in Ohlin? &quot; } This would become Krugman&apos;s most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper. { Kristian Behrens, Frédéric Robert-Nicoud (2009), &quot; Krugman&apos;s Papers in Regional Science: The 100 dollar bill on the sidewalk is gone and the 2008 Nobel Prize well-deserved &quot;, Papers in Regional Science, 88(2), pp467-489 } Krugman called the paper &quot; the love of my life in academic work. &quot; { Krugman PR (2008), &quot; Interview with the 2008 laureate in economics Paul Krugman &quot;, December 6, 2008. Stockholm, Sweden. } The &quot; home market effect &quot; that Krugman discovered in NTT also features in NEG, which interprets agglomeration &quot; as the outcome of the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and factor price differences. &quot; If trade is largely shaped by economies of scale, as Krugman&apos;s trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production. That is, NTT implies that instead of spreading out evenly around the world, production will tend to concentrate in a few countries, regions, or cities, which will become densely populated but will also have higher levels of income. [ International finance ] Krugman has also been influential in the field of international finance. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board, where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on speculative attacks in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market, resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, which showed that fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly: instead, they end in a sudden speculative attack. [ http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/crises.html &quot; Currency Crises &quot; Web.mit.edu 2011-10-04 ] Krugman&apos;s paper is considered one of the main contributions to the &apos;first generation&apos; of currency crisis models, [ Sarno Lucio Mark P. Taylor The Economics of Exchange Rates Cambridge University Press 2002 245–264 0-521-48584-3 ] { Craig Burnside, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo (2008), &quot; Currency crisis models &quot;, New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd ed. } and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009). In response to the global financial crisis of 2008, Krugman proposed, in an informal &quot; mimeo &quot; style of publication, { &quot; The International Finance Multiplier &quot;, P. Krugman, October 2008 } an &quot; international finance multiplier &quot;, to help explain the unexpected speed with which the global crisis had occurred. He argued that when, &quot; highly leveraged financial institutions [HLIs], which do a lot of cross-border investment [....] lose heavily in one market [...] they find themselves undercapitalized, and have to sell off assets across the board. This drives down prices, putting pressure on the balance sheets of other HLIs, and so on. &quot; Such a rapid contagion had hitherto been considered unlikely because of &quot; decoupling &quot; in a globalized economy. { &quot; Global Economic Integration and Decoupling &quot;, } { Donald L.

W. W. Norton, New York ISBN 0-393-04839-X } The core of Krugman&apos;s policy proposal for addressing Japan&apos;s liquidity trap was inflation targeting, which, he argued &quot; most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources. &quot; The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site. { &quot; Japan&apos;s Trap &quot;, May 2008.

In The Age of Diminished Expectations (1990), he wrote in particular about the increasing US income inequality in the &quot; New Economy &quot; of the 1990s. He attributes the rise in income inequality in part to changes in technology, but principally to a change in political atmosphere which he attributes to Movement Conservatives. In September 2003, Krugman published a collection of his columns under the title, The Great Unraveling, about the Bush administration &apos;s economic and foreign policies and the US economy in the early 2000s. His columns argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration as a result of decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the Iraq war. Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis.

That book is often taken to be the origin, the start, of a movement that ended up dominating U.S. politics that reached its first pinnacle under } { Ronald Reagan and then reached its full control of the U.S. government for most of the last eight years. &quot; } It details the history of wealth and income gaps in the United States in the 20th century. The book describes how the gap between rich and poor declined greatly in middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher even than in the 1920s. In Conscience, Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor. Krugman also argued that Republicans owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South. { Michael Tomasky, } { The New York Review of Books, November 22, 2007, &quot; The Partisan &quot; } { Krugman, Paul.

Kennedy stated, &quot; Like the rants of Rush Limbaugh or the films of Michael Moore, Krugman&apos;s shrill polemic may hearten the faithful, but it will do little to persuade the unconvinced &quot;. { &quot; Malefactors of Megawealth &quot; David M. Kennedy } In late 2008, Krugman published a substantial updating of an earlier work, entitled &quot; The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 &quot;. In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published, End This Depression Now!, a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy - people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there can not be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.

Peter Neary has noted that Krugman &quot; has written on a wide range of topics, always combining one of the best prose styles in the profession with an ability to construct elegant, insightful and useful models. &quot; { J. Peter Neary (2009), &quot; Putting the &apos;New&apos; into New Trade Theory: Paul Krugman&apos;s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics &quot;, Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 111(2), pp217-250 } Neary added that &quot; no discussion of his work could fail to mention his transition from Academic Superstar to Public Intellectual. Through his extensive writings, including a regular column for The New York Times, monographs and textbooks at every level, and books on economics and current affairs for the general public... he has probably done more than any other writer to explain economic principles to a wide audience. &quot; Krugman has been described as the most controversial economist in his generation [ http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/china%2Bthe%2Bfinancial%2Bnexus%2B%2Bkrugman/109620 &quot; China the financial nexus &quot; - Krugman Channel4.com 2011-10-04 ] and according to Michael Tomasky since 1992 he has moved &quot; from being a center-left scholar to being a liberal polemicist. &quot; From the mid-1990s onwards, Krugman wrote for Fortune (1997–99) { Princeton Weekly Bulletin, October 20, 2008, &quot; Biography of Paul Krugman &quot;, 98(7) } and Slate (1996–99), and then for The Harvard Business Review, Foreign Policy, The Economist, Harper&apos;s, and Washington Monthly. In this period Krugman critiqued various positions commonly taken on economic issues from across the political spectrum, from protectionism and opposition to the World Trade Organization on the left to supply side economics on the right. During the 1992 presidential campaign Krugman praised Bill Clinton &apos;s economic plan in The New York Times, and Clinton&apos;s campaign used some of Krugman&apos;s work on income inequality. At the time, it was considered likely that Clinton would offer him a position in the new administration, but allegedly Krugman&apos;s volatility and outspokenness caused Clinton to look elsewhere.

You have to be very good at people skills, biting your tongue when people say silly things. &quot; { New Statesman, February 16, 2004, &quot; NS Profile - Paul Krugman &quot; } In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Krugman added, &quot; you have to be reasonably organized...I can move into a pristine office and within three days it will look like a grenade went off. &quot; [ http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/12/09/paul-krugman-transcript-will-climate-legislation-kill-the-economy/ Fresh Dialogues interview with Alison van Diggelen, November 2009 Freshdialogues.com 2009-12-09 2011-10-04 ] In 1999, near the height of the dot com boom, The New York Times approached Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on &quot; the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity. &quot; His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush &apos;s policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to &quot; the silence of the media - those &apos;liberal media&apos; conservatives complain about.... &quot; Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves. After Bush&apos;s election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut in the midst of the slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman&apos;s columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, &quot; There&apos;s been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then... He&apos;s trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen. &quot; Partly as a result, Krugman&apos;s twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore, &quot; the most important political columnist in America... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years – the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels. &quot; [ Confessore Nicholas Comparative Advantage The Washington Monthly December 2002 February 5, 2007 http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0212.confessore.html ] In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as &quot; good guys but not as forceful as I&apos;d like...When I argue with them in my column this is a serious discussion.

So that&apos;s where I&apos;m pushing. &quot; Krugman&apos;s columns have drawn criticism as well as praise. A 2003 article in The Economist [ (unattributed) The one-handed economist The Economist 2003 11 ] questioned Krugman&apos;s &quot; growing tendency to attribute all the world&apos;s ills to George Bush, &quot; citing critics who felt that &quot; his relentless partisanship is getting in the way of his argument &quot; and claiming errors of economic and political reasoning in his columns. Daniel Okrent, a former The New York Times ombudsman, in his farewell column, criticized Krugman for what he said was &quot; the disturbing habit of shaping, slicing and selectively citing numbers in a fashion that pleases his acolytes but leaves him open to substantive assaults. &quot; [ Okrent Daniel 13 Things I Meant to Write About but Never Did The New York Times May 22, 2005 http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/weekinreview/22okrent.html August 16, 2009 ] Krugman&apos;s New York Times blog is &quot; The Conscience of a Liberal, &quot; devoted largely to economics and politics. Five days after 9/11 terrorist attacks Krugman argued in his column that calamity was &quot; partly self-inflicted &quot; due to transfer of responsibility for airport security from government to airlines. His column provoked an angry response and The New York Times was flooded with complaints.

Krugman argued that in the long term, only increasing total factor productivity can lead to sustained economic growth. Krugman&apos;s article was highly criticized in many Asian countries when it first appeared, and subsequent studies disputed some of Krugman&apos;s conclusions. However, it also stimulated a great deal of research, and may have caused the Singapore government to provide incentives for technological progress. [ Van Den Berg Hendrik Joshua J.

The Journal of Economic Perspectives 1 2 131–144 http://www.jstor.org/pss/1942985 American Economic Association ] However, in the same article, Krugman argues that, given the findings of New Trade Theory,... free trade is not passé, but... has irretrievably lost its innocence. Its status has shifted from optimum to reasonable rule of thumb...it can never again be asserted as the policy that economic theory tells us is always right. Nevertheless, Krugman declares in favor of free trade given the enormous political costs of actively engaging in strategic trade policy (i.e. rent-seeking) and because there is no clear method for a government to discover which industries will ultimately yield positive returns. In the same article, Krugman expressed that the phenomena of increasing returns (of which strategic trade policy depends) does not disprove the underlying truth behind comparative advantage. [ Political views ] Krugman describes himself as liberal, and has explained that he views the term &quot; liberal &quot; in the American context to mean &quot; more or less what social democratic means in Europe. &quot; In a 2009 Newsweek article, Evan Thomas described Krugman as having &quot; all the credentials of a ranking member of the East coast liberal establishment &quot; but also as someone who is anti-establishment, a &quot; scourge of the Bush administration, &quot; and a critic of the Obama administration. In 1996, Newsweek [[Michael Hirsh (journalist)|Michael Hirsh]] remarked &quot; Say this for Krugman: though an unabashed liberal... he&apos;s ideologically colorblind. He savages the supply-siders of the Reagan-Bush era with the same glee as he does the &apos;strategic traders&apos; of the Clinton administration. &quot; Krugman has advocated free markets in contexts where they are often viewed as controversial. He has written against rent control in favor of supply and demand, { Reckonings; A Rent Affair, by Paul Krugman, The New York Times, June 7, 2000 } likened the opposition against free trade and globalization to the opposition against evolution via natural selection, [ http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.htm &apos; &amp; #39;Ricardo&apos;s difficult idea&apos; &amp; #39; Web.mit.edu 2011-10-04 ] opposed farm subsidies, { True Blue Americans, by Paul Krugman, The New York Times, May 7, 2002 } argued that sweatshop s are preferable to unemployment, { In Praise of Cheap Labor by Paul Krugman, Slate, March 21, 1997 } dismissed the case for living wage s, { Book review of &apos;&apos;Living Wage: What It Is and Why We Need It&apos;&apos; Paul Krugman, Washington Monthly, September 1, 1998 } argued against mandates, subsidies, and tax breaks for ethanol, { Driving Under the Influence, by Paul Krugman, The New York Times, June 25, 2000 } and questioned NASA &apos;s manned space flights. { A Failed Mission, by Paul Krugman, The New York Times, February 4, 2003 } Krugman has also criticized U.S. zoning laws [ New York Times The Texas Unmiracle 14 Aug 2011 Paul Krugman 2011-08-14 ] and European labor market regulation. { Reckonings; Pursuing Happiness, by Paul Krugman, The New York Times, March 29, 2000 } { Reckonings; Blessed Are the Weak, by Paul Krugman, The New York Times, May 3, 2000 } He calls current Israeli policy &quot; narrow-minded &quot; and &quot; basically a gradual, long-run form of national suicide &quot;, saying that it&apos;s &quot; bad for Jews everywhere, not to mention the world &quot;. { The Crisis of Zionism, by Paul Krugman, The New York Times, 24 April 2012 } [ U.S. race relations ] Krugman has repeatedly criticized the Republican Party leadership for what he sees as a strategic (but largely tacit) reliance on racial divisions. { &quot; Republicans and Race &quot;, Paul Krugman, The New York Times, 11-19-2007 } { &quot; The Town Hall Mob &quot;, Paul Krugman, The New York Times, 08-07-2009 } { [The Conscience of a Liberal: Book Review], William Amponsah, Savannah Daily News, 12-03-2007 } In his Conscience of a Liberal, he wrote [ The changing politics of race made it possible for a revived conservative movement, whose ultimate goal was to reverse the achievements of the New Deal, to win national elections – even though it supported policies that favored the interests of a narrow elite over those of middle- and lower-income Americans. Jay Parini, The Guardian, March 22, 2008, Review: The Conscience of a Liberal ] Krugman also defended Glenn Loury, a conservative black economist at Brown University, from the criticism of many African-American political leaders. { &quot; Loury&apos;s Exodus: A profile of Glenn Loury &quot;, Robert S. Boynton, } { The New Yorker, 05-01-1995 } According to Krugman, Loury saw clearly that &quot; The problems facing African-Americans had changed.

He later wrote in an autobiographical essay, &quot; It was, in a way, strange for me to be part of the Reagan Administration. I was then and still am an unabashed defender of the welfare state, which I regard as the most decent social arrangement yet devised. &quot; { Incidents From My Career, by Paul Krugman, Princeton University Press, Retrieved December 10, 2008 } Krugman found the time &quot; thrilling, then disillusioning &quot;. He did not fit into the Washington political environment, and was not tempted to stay on. [ On Gordon Brown vs David Cameron ] Although Krugman includes Gordon Brown among those he considers at fault for the Late-2000s financial crisis, [ Gordon the Unlucky Paul Krugman June 7, 2009 The New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/opinion/08krugman.html 2011-11-24 ] he has also praised the former British Prime Minister, whom he described as &quot; more impressive than any US politician &quot; after a three-hour conversation with him.

He resigned from the panel in the fall of 1999 to comply with The New York Times rules regarding conflicts of interest, when he accepted the Times offer to become an op-ed columnist. { Paul Krugman, &quot; My Connection With Enron, One More Time &quot;, Retrieved October 27, 2008. } Krugman later stated that he was paid $37,500 (not $50,000 as often reported - his early resignation cost him part of his fee), and that, for consulting that required him to spend four days in Houston, the fee was &quot; rather low compared with my usual rates &quot;, which were around $20,000 for a one-hour speech. He also stated that the advisory panel &quot; had no function that I was aware of &quot;, and that he later interpreted his role as being &quot; just another brick in the wall &quot; Enron used to build an image.

May 24, 1999. } about the rise of the market as illustrated by Enron&apos;s energy trading, was biased by Krugman&apos;s earlier consulting work for them. Krugman later argued that &quot; The Ascent of E-Man &quot; was in character, writing &quot; I have always been a free-market Keynesian: I like free markets, but I want some government supervision to correct market failures and ensure stability. &quot; Krugman noted his previous relationship with Enron in that article and in other articles he wrote on the company. { Paul Krugman, &quot; Me and Enron &quot;.
