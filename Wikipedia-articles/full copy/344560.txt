[ August 2011 ] [ 1923 1 6 y ] { Waimate, } { New Zealand } [ 1974 8 31 1923 1 6 y ] { Wellington, } { New Zealand } { Dame Ruth Kirk (née Lucy Ruth Miller), married 1943 } { Five (Including } { John Kirk ) } { Labour } { None (originally } { Salvation Army ) } { Railway engineer } Norman Eric Kirk (6 January 1923 – 31 August 1974) was the 29th Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1972 until his sudden death in 1974. He led the Parliamentary wing of the New Zealand Labour Party from 1965 to 1974. He was the fourth Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand, but the first to be born in New Zealand. Kirk had a reputation as the most formidable debater of his time. [ Early life ] Born in Waimate, a town in South Canterbury, New Zealand, Norman Kirk came from a strong working-class background, and his household could not afford things such as daily newspaper s or a radio.

Despite this, however, he enjoyed reading, and often visited libraries. In particular, he enjoyed the study of history and geography. After leaving school, Kirk worked in a number of jobs, initially as an assistant roof-painter and later as a railway engineer. His health, however, deteriorated, and when the New Zealand Army called him up for military service in 1941 it found him medically unfit. After recovering somewhat, he returned to work, holding a number of different jobs. [ Family ] In 1943, Norman Kirk married Lucy Ruth Miller, known as Ruth, who was born in Taumarunui. The couple had three sons and two daughters. In 1975 Ruth Kirk was named Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). In 1974, while her husband was Prime Minister, she created a storm by agreeing to become patron of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. She took part in anti-abortion protest marches in Wellington and Hamilton. She died on 20 March 2000, aged 77.

Kirk bought a [ 1261 m2 on ] section at 12 Carew Street for just NZ£ 40 (compared to today&apos;s land valuation of NZ$ 126,000).

The house still stands today, albeit with an extension at the back and a hipped corrugated iron roof to replace the original leak-susceptible flat malthoid roof. [ 7445 Norman Kirk&apos;s House (Former) 2010-09-20 ] [ Mayor of Kaiapoi ] In 1951, Kirk became Chairman of the party&apos;s Hurunui electorate committee. In 1953, Kirk led Labour to a surprising victory in elections for Kaiapoi&apos;s local council, and he became the youngest mayor in the country at age 30.

He surprised officials by studying issues intensely, often emerging with better knowledge of his options than the people functioning as his advisors. He resigned as mayor on 15 January 1958 and moved his family to Christchurch.

While he increased Labour&apos;s share of the vote considerably, he did not win. In 1957, however, Kirk won the electorate of Lyttelton, reclaiming it for Labour after its surprise loss to the National Party in a previous election. In 1969 he transferred to the Sydenham seat which he held until his death. Throughout his political career, Kirk promoted the welfare state, supporting government spending for housing, health, employment, and education. As such, Kirk often appeared as a champion for ordinary New Zealanders. His working-class background also gave him some advantage, as ordinary voters saw many other politicians as out-of-touch and aloof. Gradually, Kirk began to rise through Labour&apos;s internal hierarchy, becoming vice-president of the Party in 1963 and president in 1964. At the end of 1965 he successfully challenged Arnold Nordmeyer for the parliamentary leadership. Kirk remained Leader of the Opposition until 1972, when Labour replaced the National government of Jack Marshall. [ Prime Minister ] [ Third Labour Government of New Zealand ] As Prime Minister, Kirk set a frenetic pace, implementing a great number of new policies. In particular, the Kirk government intervened far more than its predecessor in foreign relations, with Kirk taking great trouble to expand New Zealand&apos;s links with Asia and Africa. Immediately after his election as Prime Minister, Kirk withdrew all New Zealand troops from Vietnam, ending that nations 8 year involvement in the Vietnam War. Kirk will also be remembered for abolishing Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand and since then the New Zealand Defence Force has remained an all-volunteer professional force. Norman Kirk speaks to crowd outside Labour Party headquarters, Levin, 1972 Two subjects in particular caused comment. One: Kirk&apos;s strong protest against French nuclear-weapons testing in the Pacific Ocean, which led to his Government along with Australia taking France to the International Court of Justice in 1972, and him sending two New Zealand navy frigate s, HMNZS Canterbury and Otago, into the test zone area at Mururoa Atoll in a symbolic act of protest in 1973. { Mururoa Nuclear Tests, RNZN protest Veterans } { Disarmament and Security Centre - Publications - Papers } The other: his refusal to allow a visit by a South Africa n rugby team, a decision he made because the apartheid régime in South Africa would not accept racial integration for that sport. He was also highly critical of US foreign policy, speaking before the United Nations of the US involvement in the coup d&apos;état in Chile in 1973. The Kirk government was also notable for a number of national identity building policies. The Kirk government began the tradition of New Zealand Day in 1973, and introduced legislation in 1974 to declare Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of New Zealand. During his time as Prime Minister Kirk, a non-smoker, kept up an intense schedule and rarely took vacation time. His health began to decline once more. At the end of 1973, he developed heart problems, but recovered. Despite his illness, Kirk refused to reduce his workload by any significant degree. By August 1974 Kirk&apos;s situation had worsened and he was finally persuaded to enter hospital. Three days later he died of heart problems, aged 51. A state funeral, attended by thousands, took place on 4 September 1974, followed by interment in his hometown, Waimate. He was succeeded in the Sydenham electorate by his son John Kirk.
