Writer Larry McMurtry referred to Abbey as the &quot; Thoreau of the American West &quot;. [ Early life and education ] Abbey was born in Indiana, Pennsylvania on January 29, 1927 to Mildred Postlewait and Paul Revere Abbey. Mildred was a schoolteacher and a church organist, and gave Abbey an appreciation for classical music and literature.

Eight months before his 18th birthday, when he would be faced with being drafted into the United States military, Abbey decided to explore the American southwest. He travelled by foot, bus, hitchhiking, and freight train hopping. During this trip he fell in love with the desert country of the Four Corners region. Abbey wrote: &quot; [...] crags and pinnacles of naked rock, the dark cores of ancient volcanoes, a vast and silent emptiness smoldering with heat, color, and indecipherable significance, above which floated a small number of pure, clear, hard-edged clouds.

He lived in a house trailer that had been provided to him by the Park Service, as well as in a ramada that he built himself.

He did not want to be embalmed or placed in a coffin. Instead, he preferred to be placed inside of an old sleeping bag, and requested that his friends disregard all state laws concerning burial. &quot; I want my body to help fertilize the growth of a cactus or cliff rose or sagebrush or tree. &quot; said the message.
