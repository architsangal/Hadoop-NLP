Its population was at 13,431 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Beltrami County. [ 6 ] Bemidji is the principal city in North Central Minnesota and the largest commercial center between Grand Forks, North Dakota and Duluth, Minnesota. Bemidji houses many Native American services, including the Indian Health Service. The city is the central hub of the Red Lake Indian Reservation, White Earth Indian Reservation and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. Bemidji lies on the southwest shore of Lake Bemidji, the northernmost lake feeding the Mississippi River and, as such, is deemed &quot; the first city on the Mississippi. &quot; Bemidji is also dubbed the &quot; curling capital, &quot; of the U.S. Its name derives from the Ojibwe Bay-may-ji-ga-maug ( Double-Vowel orthography : bemijigamaag), [ http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/ojibwe.html Freelang Ojibwe Dictionary ] meaning &quot; lake that traverses another body of water &quot;. On occasion, in Ojibwe, the city of Bemidji is called Wabigamaang ( &quot; at the lake channel/narrows &quot; ), because part of the city is situated on the Lakes Bemidji/Irving narrows, located on the south end of Lake Bemidji, and extends to the eastern shore of Lake Irving. Some people also credit the name to Chief Bemidji, a Ojibwe chief. [ History ] Bemidji Township was surveyed in 1874, and organized in 1896, twenty four days after the village of Bemidji was chartered, and is the oldest township in the county. In 1897 the county attorney declared the original Bemidji township organization illegal (no reason given), and the township reorganized June 26, 1897. The first official township road began in 1897 on the south shore of Lake Bemidji, ran along the east shore of Lake Irving, into the Carr Lake community continuing south and then west across the Schoolcraft and along the west shore of Lake Plantagenet, taking travelers to Park Rapids. { Bemidji Township website } [ Park and recreation ] Bemidji is near Itasca State Park, Lake Bemidji State Park, state forest areas, Big Bog State Recreation areas, and the Chippewa National Forest.

Bemidji Minnesota History } Bemidji is a college city with strong arts influences. The city&apos;s streets are lined with small shops and adorned with sculptures and other forms of public art. The Concordia Language Villages are located near Bemidji and this has, perhaps, been influential in the existence of several language conversational groups (including French, Norwegian, Spanish, Italian, and German) that meet weekly in local coffee houses. During the summer the Paul Bunyan Playhouse operates a non- Equity, summer stock theater. The city is well known to fans of the sport of curling. Both men&apos;s and women&apos;s rinks from the Bemidji Curling Club won the right to represent the United States in the 2005 World Curling Championship and the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy. Pete Fenson, the skip of the U.S. curling team that took the bronze medal at the 2006 Olympics, is a native of Bemidji, as is Natalie Nicholson, who was the lead for the United States women&apos;s team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. A city referendum for a Bemidji Regional Events Center passed by a slim majority of 43 votes out of 4,583 votes cast in November 2006.
