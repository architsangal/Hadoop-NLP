Mays built a spinning mill along the banks of the South Fork of the Catawba River, just east of Gastonia, North Carolina. In 1910, textile engineer and Thomasville, North Carolina native, Stuart Warren Cramer became owner and president of the mill and property. He turned the mill and the surrounding community into a model mill village. In 1922 Mr. Cramer changed the name of the mill to Cramerton Mills, and the name of the town to Cramerton. In 1923, Cramer built the Mayflower Weave Mill. Cramer is credited with designing and equipping &quot; about one-third of the new cotton mills in the South &quot; between 1895 and 1915, and simultaneously acquiring extensive holdings in textile mills. Among Cramer&apos;s numerous industrial engineering patents was one for the &quot; Cramer System of Air Conditioning, &quot; which included the automatic regulation of temperature and humidity. These early innovations in air conditioning resulted more from the need to remove lint from the air (a persistent problem in the textile mills) than to cool the factory atmosphere. The term &quot; air conditioning &quot; is attributed to Cramer. { The Parks-Cramer Company Complex, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission.
