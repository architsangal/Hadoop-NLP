[ History ] [ Settlement ] { Hawkins County Courthouse, ca. 1835-36, is situated at the center of Rogersville. It is the oldest courthouse in } { Tennessee still in use. } In 1775, the grandparents of Davy Crockett, a sometime member of the United States Congress from Tennessee and hero of the Alamo, settled what is today downtown Rogersville near a spring that bears their name. { Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) chs. 1-2. } After hostile native Americans massacred or captured most of the family from their homestead, the Crocketts sold the property to a new settler in the area, a French Huguenot man named Colonel Thomas Amis. { Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) ch. 2. } In 1780, Colonel Amis built a fort at Big Creek with the assistance of fellow settler and Scots-Irish John Carter, on the outskirts of the present-day town. Not far from this fort in the same year, about three and one-half miles above downtown Rogersville, Colonel Amis erected a fort-like stone house, around which he built a palisade for protection against Native American attacks. { Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) chs. 1. } The next year Amis opened a store, and erected a blacksmith shop and a distillery. { Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) ch. 1. } Very soon after he also put into operation a saw and grist-mill, and from the first he kept a house of entertainment. [ Founding of the town ] In 1785, the State of Franklin organized Spencer County, including, besides other territory, the present Hawkins County, and declared the seat of county government to be located at what today is Rogersville. { Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) chs. 2-3 } Thomas Henderson was chosen county court clerk and colonel of militia, and William Cocke and Thomas King representatives to the Franklin General Assembly. The remaining officers are unknown. In November 1786, after the Franklin government had ceded authority back to North Carolina, that State&apos;s General Assembly passed an act creating Hawkins County. { Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) ch. 3. } It included within its limits all the territory between Bays Mountain and the Holston and Tennessee Rivers on the east to the Cumberland Mountains on the west. The county court was organized at the house of Thomas Gibbons, but as the early records were destroyed during the American Civil War, nothing is known of its transactions. Like Franklin, North Carolina set the county seat about the property of a recent and enterprising settler, Irishman Joseph Rogers. { Price, Henry, Old Rogersville: An Illustrated History of Rogersville, Tennessee. Vol. I. (Rogersville: 2001) ch. 4. } [ Joseph and Mary: Rogersville&apos;s founding love story ] { Joseph Rogers, 1764-1833, founded Rogersville on land granted to him by his father-in-law after his marriage to his beloved Mary. } Joseph Rogers was born August 21, 1764 near Cook&apos;s Town, Ireland, the son of James Rogers and his wife Elizabeth Brown. He travelled to the area then known as the State of Franklin or western North Carolina, called &quot; the Holston country, &quot; by 1785 and, during a stay at a tavern adjacent to Colonel Thomas Amis&apos; home, had fallen in love with the Colonel&apos;s daughter, Mary Amis. Rogers married Mary Amis on October 24, 1786, despite Colonel Amis&apos; initial dislike for him. Eventually, the Colonel gave his blessing and ceded the lands near Crockett Spring to his son-in-law—land that Colonel Amis had purchased from the heirs of David Crockett, Sr. When North Carolina was considering where to establish the county seat for its new Hawkins County, Rogers successfully lobbied, through the influence of his father-in-law, to have the government located near his home; he even volunteered his tavern, set up around 1784-85, as the first county courthouse in 1787. Rogers, with the help of other local settlers, laid out a plan for the town, and the town of Rogersville was chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1789. The plan included a public square, deeded to the town government, which would host the town&apos;s public well and the county courthouse. Rogers was a successful businessman and tavern keeper. In November 1792, he was appointed the first postmaster at Rogersville, and the second post office of Rogersville, built by its founder circa 1815, still stands at the corner of East Main Street and South Hasson Street. Rogers was the father of fourteen children with Mary. He died on November 6, 1833, at Rogersville, near the hour of midnight. He was buried in Rogers Cemetery, near the founding site of the Town. His wife Mary died a month later, the victim, according to legend, of a broken heart at the loss of her beloved Joseph. [ A town divided: the American Civil War ] [ Battle of Rogersville ] In November 1863, during the American Civil War, Rogersville was the site of a battle between occupying Federal forces and invading Confederate troops. Union forces were encamped just outside the town. The Confederates, led by Brigadier General William E. Jones, were able to surprise the Union forces and pursue them across the Holston River and into Greene County. The Confederates held the town for the remainder of the War. Sentiment in Rogersville was divided between loyalists, many of whom supported the efforts by many to get twenty-six East Tennessee counties to secede from the State and re-join the Union. Other Rogersvillians saw President Lincoln&apos;s invasion of Tennessee as an unprecedented invasion of their homes and an incursion by Federal power; these people became strong Confederates. Partly because of the town&apos;s mixed loyalties, Rogersville was spared destruction during the war; indeed, many of the town&apos;s buildings were used by the different occupying armies. [ Printing history: the cradle of Tennessee journalism ] Downtown Rogersville has been home to many of the town&apos;s numerous newspapers and publications. George Roulstone was Tennessee&apos;s first printer. He was brought, along with his printing press to Rogersville by the new governor of the Southwest Territory, William Blount, who was sensitive to the fact that government could not exist without printing. Roulston printed Rogersville&apos;s, and Tennessee&apos;s, first newspaper on November 5, 1791. Because Knoxville, the intended seat of the new territorial government, had not yet been established, Roulstone published the first year of his paper near Joseph Rogers &apos; tavern. To hedge his bets, Roulstone called the newspaper The Knoxville Gazette, and in October 1792, he moved his press to Knoxville, where he continued to publish the Gazette as well as other papers until his death in 1804. After the Gazette was moved, there was no newspaper in the area until 1813, when John B. Hood began publishing The East Tennessee Gazette at Rogersville. Other papers shortly followed, including The Western Pilot, circa 1815, and The Rogersville Gazette from the same era. Speciality publications emerged during these early days, including The Rail-Road Advocate, The Calvinistic Magazine, and The Holston Watchman. Numerous other newspapers have been published in Rogersville over the years, most surviving only a short time and having modest circulation. Among them were The Independent, The Rogersville Spectator, The Weekly Reporter, The Rogersville Gazette, Rogersville Press and Times, Holston Journal, Hawkins County Republican, Hawkins County Telephone, and The Rogersville Herald. Rogersville&apos;s longest-lasting newspaper is The Rogersville Review, which began publication as The Holston Review in 1885 by William T. Robertson. A year later, Robertson changed the name to the present banner, and the paper has published without fail to the present day. The Review&apos;s closest competitor was The Rogersville Herald, which was published from 1886 to 1932. The Herald competed with the Review during that 46-year period and survived longer than any other local newspaper the Review. The town&apos;s storied printing heritage is chronicled by the Tennessee Newspaper and Printing Museum, located in its historic Southern Railway train depot, circa 1890.
