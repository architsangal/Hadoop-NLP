Justin Timberlake is the only artist to win the award more than once, with a total of two. Since its inception, American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to musicians or groups originating from the United Kingdom twice, and from Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, France, and Italy once. Madonna holds the record for the most nominations, with five. Gloria Estefan holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with three. [ History ] Though she was not the first to suggest that the genre be recognized officially, Ellyn Harris and her Committee for the Advancement of Dance Music lobbied for more than two years to encourage the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to acknowledge dance music.

Others were concerned that dance music was not a long-lasting genre, fearing the category would face retirement much like the award for Best Disco Recording, which was presented for one year only at the 22nd Grammy Awards in 1980. In 1998, Harris&apos; efforts paid off when the Academy first presented the award to Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder at the 40th Grammy Awards for the song &quot; Carry On &quot;. While the Academy had once been quoted as saying that &quot; they considered dance music as something pop artists had created in their most frivolous moments &quot;, Ivan Bernstein, executive director of the organization&apos;s Florida branch, insisted that an award for excellence in dance music would not exist &quot; if there were concerns about excellence &quot;.
