The New Zealand Royal Honours system is the system of orders, decorations and medals which are awarded to recognise achievements of, or service by, New Zealanders or others in connection with New Zealand. Until 1975, the British honours system was used. Since then a number of uniquely New Zealand honours have been introduced, and now only the dynastic British honours are retained. Awards are made by the Queen (in her capacity as Queen of New Zealand ), on ministerial advice. However, certain awards exist which are in the exclusive gift of the Queen. { http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/history.html } The Honours Secretariat of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is responsible for the administration of honours. [ History ] Since the beginning of settlement in the mid nineteenth century, British honours were awarded in New Zealand. In 1848, Governor George Grey received the first honour granted to a New Zealand resident, becoming a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. { History of the New Zealand Honours System, accessed 22 July 2006. } For more than a hundred years the British honours system was used for New Zealand. In 1975, after a review of the system, two uniquely New Zealand honours were integrated into it: the Queen&apos;s Service Order, and its affiliated Medal. In 1987, the Order of New Zealand was instituted as the supreme New Zealand honour. A further review of the system in 1996 and 1997 resulted in the termination of awards of almost all British honours and the creation of a new five-level New Zealand Order of Merit to replace them. { New Zealand Order of Merit, accessed 22 July 2006 } In March 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced the return of knighthoods to the New Zealand Honours system, with past recipients of the New Zealand Order of Merit to be eligible to receive titles.
