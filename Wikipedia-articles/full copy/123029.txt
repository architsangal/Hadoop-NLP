[ History ] The first European-American settlers in Phelps County arrived in the early 19th century, working as farmers and iron workers along the local rivers, such as the Meramec, the Gasconade, and the Little Piney. In 1844 John Webber built the first house in what became the City of Rolla. Nine years later, railroad contractor Edmund Ward Bishop, considered to be the founder of Rolla, settled in the area. The state officially established Rolla as a town in 1858. Two stories account for how Rolla was named. One, widely regarded as a folk legend, and acknowledged as such by the Phelps County Historical Society, comes from competition with neighboring Dillon, Missouri to be designated the county seat. When Rolla was made the county seat in 1861, the residents of Dillon, having lost a round, were allowed to choose the name of the new city and named it Rolla, after a good-for-nothing hunting dog. The more widely accepted story came from a citizens&apos; meeting about naming the town. Webber was said to prefer the name Hardscrabble, used to describe the soils in the region, and Bishop pushed for the name Phelps Center. New settlers from North Carolina voted to name the town after their hometown of Raleigh but chose to spell the Missouri version phonetically. With numerous settlers from the South, many residents of Rolla leaned toward the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The town was taken by Union forces in June, 1861. They built two minor forts during their occupation, Fort Wyman and Fort Dette. For most of its history, Rolla has served as a transportation and trading center. Rolla was the original terminus of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad, colloquially known as the &quot; Frisco Line &quot;. Today the BNSF Railway runs directly through the town. Rolla was a regular stop along U.S. Route 66, as it is located almost exactly halfway between the larger cities of St. Louis and Springfield. Today Interstate 44, U.S. Route 63, and Route 72 all run through Rolla. {, Rolla Chamber of Commerce, accessed 16 Jun 2008 } [ Geography ] Rolla is located at [ 37.948831 -91.763048 type:city_region:US dms inline ].
