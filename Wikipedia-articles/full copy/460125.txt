In accordance with South Carolina law, Sanford was elected separately from the state&apos;s Republican lieutenant governor, Andre Bauer. Sanford and Bauer&apos;s wins gave the Republicans full control of state government for the first time since Reconstruction. In 2003, just after becoming governor, Sanford joined the Air Force Reserve and attended two week’s training in Alabama with his unit, the 315th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron.

Later in his tenure, he embarked on a plan to reform methods of funding the state&apos;s public education system, including measures such as school vouchers – aimed at introducing more competition into the school system as a means of fostering improvement. The plan, known as &quot; Put Parents In Charge, &quot; proposed to provide around $2,500 per child to parents who chose to withdraw their children from the state&apos;s public school system and instead send them to independent schools. Sanford framed this plan as a necessary market-based reform. Sanford also sought to reform the state&apos;s public college system. Sanford has criticized these schools as focusing too much on separately creating research institutions and not on educating the young adults of South Carolina. Sanford also suggested that they combine some programs as a means of curbing tuition increases. The schools did not respond positively to this suggestion, however, causing Sanford to remark that &quot; if any institution ultimately feels uncomfortable with our push toward coordination, they can exit the system and go private. &quot; Sanford also indicated a desire to increase the powers of the governor.
