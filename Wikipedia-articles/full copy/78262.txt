He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R &amp; B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic &quot; Gloria &quot;. His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single &quot; Brown Eyed Girl &quot; in 1967.After Berns&apos; death, Warner Bros.

Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.

The longest, &quot; Summertime in England &quot;, lasted fifteen and one-half minutes and ended with the words, &quot; Can you feel the silence? &quot;. NME magazine&apos;s Paul Du Noyer called the album &quot; colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak. &quot; Even Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, said: &quot; It&apos;s Van acting the part of the &apos;mystic poet&apos; he thinks he&apos;s supposed to be. &quot; Morrison insisted that the album was never &quot; meant to be a commercial album. &quot; Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: &quot; He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality. &quot; Later the critics would reassess the album more favourably with the success of &quot; Summertime in England &quot;. Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, &quot; Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us [sic] rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics. &quot; Morrison&apos;s next album, Beautiful Vision, released in 1982, had him returning once again to the music of his Northern Irish roots. { Rogan (2006), page 338. } Well received by the critics and public, it produced a minor UK hit single, &quot; Cleaning Windows &quot;, that referenced one of Morrison&apos;s first jobs after leaving school. { Rogan (2006), pages 337–338. } Several other songs on the album, &quot; Vanlose Stairway &quot;, &quot; She Gives Me Religion &quot;, and the instrumental, &quot; Scandinavia &quot; show the presence of a new personal muse in his life: a Danish public relations agent, who would share Morrison&apos;s spiritual interests and serve as a steadying influence on him throughout most of the 1980s. { Heylin (2003), page 371. } &quot; Scandinavia &quot;, with Morrison on piano, [ http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21723 Fricke David Inarticulate Speech of the Heart Music Review Rolling Stone 28 April 1983 23 July 2010 ] was nominated in the Best Rock Instrumental Performance category for the 25th Annual Grammy Awards.

His 1983 album, Inarticulate Speech of the Heart was &quot; a move towards creating music for meditation &quot; with synthesisers, uilleann pipes and flute sounds and four of the tracks were instrumentals. { Turner (1993), page 153. } The titling of the album and the presence of the instrumentals were noted to be indicative of Morrison&apos;s long-held belief that &quot; it&apos;s not the words one uses but the force of conviction behind those words that matters. &quot; During this period of time, Morrison had studied Scientology and gave &quot; Special Thanks &quot; to L. Ron Hubbard on the album&apos;s credits. { Turner (1993), page 150 } A Sense of Wonder, Morrison&apos;s 1985 album, pulled together the spiritual themes contained in his last four albums, which were defined in a Rolling Stone review as: &quot; rebirth (Into the Music), deep contemplation and meditation, (Common One); ecstasy and humility (Beautiful Vision); and blissful, mantra like languor (Inarticulate Speech of the Heart). &quot; [ http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/3045/21725 Puterbaugh Parke A Sense of Wonder Music Review Rolling Stone 9 May 1985 23 July 2010 ] The single, &quot; Tore Down a la Rimbaud &quot; was a reference to Rimbaud and an earlier bout of writer&apos;s block that Morrison had encountered in 1974. { Heylin (2003), page 308. } In 1985, Morrison also wrote the musical score for the movie, Lamb starring Liam Neeson. { Collis (1996), page 162. } Morrison&apos;s 1986 release, No Guru, No Method, No Teacher, was said to contain a &quot; genuine holiness...and musical freshness that needs to be set in context to understand. &quot; { Hinton (1997), page 255. } Critical response was favourable with a Sounds reviewer calling the album &quot; his most intriguingly involved since Astral Weeks &quot; and &quot; Morrison at his most mystical, magical best. &quot; { Heylin (2003), page 396. } { Rogan (2006), page 360. } It contains the song, &quot; In the Garden &quot; that, according to Morrison, had a &quot; definite meditation process which is a &apos;form&apos; of transcendental meditation as its basis.

He entitled the album as a rebuttal to media attempts to place him in various creeds. { Hinton (1997), page 253. } In an interview in the Observer he told Anthony Denselow: [ There have been many lies put out about me and this finally states my position.

By 1972, after being a performer for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing stage fright when performing for audiences of thousands, as opposed to the hundreds as he had experienced in his early career. He became anxious on stage and would have difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. He once said in an interview about performing on stage, &quot; I dig singing the songs but there are times when it&apos;s pretty agonizing for me to be out there. &quot; After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences. The 1974 live double album, It&apos;s Too Late to Stop Now, has been on lists of greatest live albums of all time.

Soon after recording the album, Morrison restructured the Caledonia Soul Orchestra into a smaller unit, the Caledonia Soul Express. { Heylin (2003), page 284. } { The Band &apos;s final concert filmed for &apos;&apos; } { The Last Waltz &apos;&apos;. } On Thanksgiving Day 1976, Morrison performed at the farewell concert for The Band. Morrison&apos;s first live performance in several years, he considered skipping his appearance until the last minute, even refusing to go on stage when they announced his name. His manager, Harvey Goldsmith, said he &quot; literally kicked him out there. &quot; { Heylin (2003), page 313. } Morrison was on good terms with The Band as near-neighbours in Woodstock, and they had the shared experience of stage-fright. At the concert, he performed two songs. His first was a rendition of the classic Irish song Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral. [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dx1RxTEOn_Y0 Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral, The Last Waltz ] His second song was &quot; Caravan &quot;, from his 1970 album Moondance. Greil Marcus, in attendance at the concert, wrote: &quot; Van Morrison turned the show around...singing to the rafters and...burning holes in the floor. It was a triumph, and as the song ended Van began to kick his leg into the air out of sheer exuberance and he kicked his way right offstage like a Rockette. The crowd had given him a fine welcome and they cheered wildly when he left. &quot; [ http://theband.hiof.no/articles/lwgm.html Marcus, Greil 30 December 1976 The Bands Last Waltz (Rolling Stone Magazine) theband.hiof.no 31 March 2007 ] The filmed concert served as the basis for Martin Scorsese &apos;s 1978 film, The Last Waltz.

When Morrison sang the duet &quot; 4% Pantomime &quot; (that he co-wrote with Robbie Robertson ), Richard Manuel calls him, &quot; Oh, Belfast Cowboy &quot;. It would be included in The Band&apos;s album Cahoots. When he left the stage, after performing &quot; Caravan &quot; on The Last Waltz, Robertson calls out &quot; Van the Man! &quot; On 21 July 1990, Morrison joined many other guests for Roger Waters &apos; massive performance of The Wall - Live in Berlin with an estimated crowd of between three hundred thousand to half a million people and broadcast live on television. [ http://www.rogerwaters.org/about_berlin.html The Wall Live in Berlin rogerwaters.org 7 July 2998 ] He sang &quot; Comfortably Numb &quot; with Roger Waters, and several members from The Band: Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko. At concert&apos;s end, he and the other performers sang &quot; The Tide Is Turning &quot;. Morrison performed before an estimated audience of sixty to eighty thousand people when US President Bill Clinton visited Belfast, Northern Ireland on 30 November 1995. His song &quot; Days Like This &quot; had become the official anthem for the Northern Irish peace movement. { Rogan (2006), page 437. } Van Morrison continued performing concerts in the 2000s throughout the year rather than touring. Playing few of his best-known songs in concert, he has firmly resisted relegation to a nostalgia act.

Also frequently present in Morrison&apos;s best love songs is a blending of the sacred-profane as evidenced in &quot; Into the Mystic &quot; and &quot; So Quiet in Here &quot;. { Hinton (1997), page 13. } [ Rolling Stone Enlightenment: Van Morrison review Swenson, John 15 November 1990 ] Beginning with his 1979 album, Into the Music and the song &quot; And the Healing Has Begun &quot;, a frequent theme of his music and lyrics has been based on his belief in the healing power of music combined with a form of mystic Christianity. This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work. { Collis (1996), page 149. } His lyrics show an influence of the visionary poets William Blake and W. B. Yeats { Hinton (1997), page 12. } and others such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. { Turner (1993), page 145 } Biographer Brian Hinton believes &quot; like any great poet from Blake to Seamus Heaney he takes words back to their origins in magic...Indeed, Morrison is returning poetry to its earliest roots – as in Homer or Old English epics like Beowulf or the Psalms or folk song – in all of which words and music combine to form a new reality. &quot; Another biographer John Collis believes that Morrison&apos;s style of jazz singing and repeating phrases preclude his lyrics from being regarded as poetry or as Collis asserts: &quot; he is more likely to repeat a phrase like a mantra, or burst into scat singing. The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry. &quot; { Collis (1996), page 10. } Morrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that: &quot; I write from a different place. I do not even know what it is called or if it has a name. It just comes and I sculpt it, but it is also a lot of hard work doing the sculpting. &quot; [ Performance style ] &quot; Van Morrison is interested, obsessed with how much musical or verbal information he can compress into a small space, and, almost, conversely, how far he can spread one note, word, sound, or picture. To capture one moment, be it a caress or a twitch. He repeats certain phrases to extremes that from anybody else would seem ridiculous, because he&apos;s waiting for a vision to unfold, trying as unobtrusively as possible to nudge it along...It&apos;s the great search, fueled by the belief that through these musical and mental processes illumination is attainable. Or may at least be glimpsed. &quot; &lt; p style= &quot; text-align: right; &quot; &gt; Lester Bangs [ http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~murray/astral.html Lester Bangs on Astral Weeks Lester Bangs personal.cis.strath.ac.uk 8 February 2009 ] Critic Greil Marcus argues that given the truly distinctive breadth and complexity of Morrison&apos;s work, it is almost impossible to cast his work among that of others: &quot; Morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in the history of rock &amp; roll, a singer who cannot be pinned down, dismissed, or fitted into anyone&apos;s expectations. &quot; { Marcus (1992), page 447. } Or in the words of Jay Cocks : &quot; He extends himself only to express himself. Alone among rock&apos;s great figures—and even in that company he is one of the greatest—Morrison is adamantly inward. And unique. Although he freely crosses musical boundaries—R. and B., Celtic melodies, jazz, rave-up rock, hymns, down-and-dirty blues—he can unfailingly be found in the same strange place: on his own wavelength. &quot; [ http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C974140-1%2C00.html Listen to the Lion TIME Cocks, Jay 28 October 1991 12 January 2009 ] His transcendental signature style came into full expression with his 1968 classic, Astral Weeks.

His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaniety between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signaling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity.

Over the years he has recorded songs from a varying list of genres drawn from many influences and interests. As well as blues and R &amp; B, his compositions and covers have moved between pop music, jazz, rock, folk, country, gospel, Irish folk and traditional, big band, skiffle, rock and roll, new age, classical and sometimes spoken word ( &quot; Coney Island &quot; ) and instrumental s. { Hinton (1997), page 15. } Morrison defines himself as a soul singer.

Yorke relates that Morrison &quot; discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old Irish and Scottish folk music. &quot; [ Caledonia ] The name &quot; Caledonia &quot; has played a prominent role in Morrison&apos;s life and career. Biographer Ritchie Yorke had pointed out already by 1975 that Morrison has referred to Caledonia so many times in his career that he &quot; seems to be obsessed with the word. &quot; In his 2009 biography, Erik Hage found that &quot; Morrison seemed deeply interested in his paternal Scottish roots during his early career, and later in the ancient countryside of England, hence his repeated use of the term Caledonia (an ancient Roman name for Scotland/northern Britain). &quot; { Hage (2009), page 52. } As well as being his daughter&apos;s middle name, it&apos;s the name of his first production company, his studio, his publishing company, two of his backing groups, and he also recorded a cover of the song, &quot; Caldonia &quot; (with the name spelled &quot; Caledonia &quot; ) in 1974. Morrison used &quot; Caledonia &quot; in what has been called a quintessential Van Morrison moment in the song, &quot; Listen to the Lion &quot; with the lyrics, &quot; And we sail, and we sail, way up to Caledonia &quot;.

[ Influence ] Morrison&apos;s influence can readily be heard in the music of a diverse array of major artists and according to The Rolling Stone&apos;s Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll (Simon &amp; Shuster, 2001), &quot; his influence among rock singers/song writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend, Bob Dylan. Echoes of Morrison&apos;s rugged literateness and his gruff, feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Elvis Costello &quot;. His influence includes U2 ( Bono was quoted saying &quot; I am in awe of a musician like Van Morrison. I had to stop listening to Van Morrison records about six months before we made The Unforgettable Fire because I didn&apos;t want his very original soul voice to overpower my own. &quot; ); { Bayles, Martha.
