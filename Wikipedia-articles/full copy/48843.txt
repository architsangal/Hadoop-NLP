[ Physical description ] The largemouth is an olive green fish, marked by a series of dark, sometimes black, blotches forming a jagged horizontal stripe along each flank. The upper jaw ( maxilla ) of a largemouth bass extends beyond the rear margin of the orbit. { In-Fisherman Largemouth Bass Description } In comparison to age, a female bass is larger than a male. { Fresh water fish identification Largemouth bass.http://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/Freshwaterfish_LargemouthBass.htm.

[ Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/lmb/ Texas Parks and Wildlife October 3, 2008 ] [ Forage ] Depiction of largemouth bass in its habitat The juvenile largemouth bass consumes mostly small bait fish, scud s, small shrimp, and insects. Adults consume smaller fish ( bluegill ), snails, crawfish ( crayfish ), frogs, snakes, salamander s, bat s and even small water bird s, mammal s, and baby alligator s. { YouTube – Fish vs Alligator } In larger lakes and reservoirs, adult bass occupy deeper water than younger fish, and shift to a diet consisting almost entirely of smaller fish like shad, yellow perch, ciscoes, shiners, and sunfish. It also consumes younger members of larger fish species, such as pike, catfish, trout, walleye, white bass, striped bass, and even smaller black bass. Prey items can be as large as 25 to 50% of the bass&apos;s body length. Studies of prey utilization by largemouths show that in weedy waters, bass grow more slowly due to difficulty in acquiring prey. Less weed cover allows bass to more easily find and catch prey, but this consists of more open-water baitfish. Paradoxically, with little or no cover, bass can devastate the prey population and starve or be stunted. Fisheries managers must consider these factors when designing regulations for specific bodies of water. Under overhead cover, such as overhanging banks, brush, or submerged structure, such as weedbeds, points, humps, ridges, and drop-offs, the largemouth bass uses its senses of hearing, sight, vibration, and smell to attack and seize its prey. Adult largemouth are generally apex predator s within their habitat, but they are preyed upon by many animals while young. { In-Fisherman – Largemouth Bass Forage } [ Angling ] [ Bass fishing ] Largemouth bass, caught and released in Minnesota Largemouth are keenly sought after by angler s and are noted for the excitement of their fight. The fish will often become airborne in their effort to throw the hook, but many say that their cousin species, the smallmouth bass, can beat them pound for pound. { Smallmouth Bass: Minnesota DNR } Anglers most often fish for largemouth bass with lure s such as plastic worm s (and other plastic baits), jigs, crankbait s and spinnerbait s. A recent trend is the use of large swimbait s to target trophy bass that often forage on juvenile rainbow trout in California. Live bait, such as nightcrawlers, minnows, frogs, or crawfish can also be productive. In fact, large golden shiner s are one of the worst baits to use to catch trophy bass, especially when they are sluggish in the heat of summer or in the cold of winter. Strong cultural pressure among largemouth bass anglers encourages the fish&apos;s live release, especially the larger specimens, mainly because larger specimens are usually breeding females that contribute heavily to future sport fishing stocks. Largemouth bass, if handled with care, respond well to catch and release. The largemouth bass has been known to exist in many of the lower 48 states of the U.S. Although it is most popular in the southeastern states, many different varieties of the largemouth bass can be found in the north and western regions. They are an invasive species in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, bringing in sea lice and eating native fish. [ October 2008 ] [ Invasive species ] The largemouth bass has been introduced into many other countries due to its popularity as a sport fish. It causes the decline, displacement or extinctions of species in its new habitat, for example in Namibia.

In the northern portion of its territory, it prefers smaller lakes and ponds. Largemouth bass are very aggressive fish and will strike at nearly anything they consider alive; anglers tell stories of them taking small birds, rodents, and even baby alligators [ July 2011 ].
