{ Northern Ireland peace process in } { Armagh in September 1998. } In British politics, the term Blairism refers to the political ideology of former leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who left both positions in 2007 to become Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East. Proponents of Blairism are referred to as Blairites. [ Ideology ] { Bill Clinton (left) meets with Blair in November 1999, his close partner in their mutual } { Atlanticist views and emphasis on the } { special relationship. } [ Third Way (centrism) ] Politically, Blair has been identified with record investment into public services, an interventionist and Atlanticist foreign policy, support for stronger law enforcement powers, a large focus on surveillance as a means to address terrorism and a large focus on education as a means to encourage social mobility. In the early years (circa 1994-1997), Blairism was also associated with support for European integration and particularly British participation in the European single currency, though this waned after Labour took office. The term is used in particular in contrast to Brownite, to identify those within the Labour Party with a connection to, or identification with, Gordon Brown rather than Blair. However, with Blair and Brown typically in agreement on most political issues { How to bear Blair: become a Blairite } { Will Hutton, } { Guardian Unlimited - } { Comment is free, 21 June 2006 } (from Iraq to public sector reform), commentators have noted that &quot; the difference between Brownites and Blairites … is more tribal than ideological &quot;. { Jack the Knife goes for the clearout kill Kirsty Milne, } { The Scotsman, 28 November 2001 } This is believed to stem from a personal disagreement between Blair and Brown over who should have run for the leadership following the death of John Smith in 1994: though Brown was originally considered the senior of the two, he waited until after Smith&apos;s funeral to begin campaigning by which point Blair had gathered too much momentum to be beaten. { Will he? Won&apos;t he? Suzie Mackenzie, } { The Guardian, 25 September 2004 } The term is often used to describe individuals who supported Blair&apos;s leadership or those who supported his radical policies. Often Brownite s are seen as more left and, by some, seen to have a slightly more Liberal or Liberal Left ideology than Blairites. Brownites are also against the third way and are for more democratic socialist then Blairites. [ October 2011 ] For a long time, there has been a great deal of discussion in British politics about the Blairite legacy. This has intensified since September 2006, when Blair announced his intention to resign within a year, and especially since May 2007, when he said he would resign as Prime Minister on June 27, 2007. While centrists such as Gordon Brown and David Cameron claim that Blairism is safe in their hands, critics on the left (e.g. John McDonnell ) and right (e.g. Norman Tebbit ) dispute its value to British society. [ October 2011 ] Others have even speculated that, if the Blairite coalition is to be seen as essentially one of pro-market anti-Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats could even be its ultimate inheritors. { Kennedy can still exploit this perfect political storm } { Martin Kettle, } { The Guardian, 26 April 2005 } In a 1999 article, the centre-right news-magazine The Economist stated: [ Mr Blair will doubtless do his duty and lavish praise on Labour’s glorious past. But, in truth, Mr Blair has always displayed a marked ambivalence towards Labour history. His greatest achievement in opposition was to get the party to ditch its historic commitment to nationalisation, and to water down its traditional links with the unions. At times he has even hinted that the very foundation of the Labour Party was a mistake, since it divided “progressive” politics and led to a century dominated by the Conservatives. Mr Blair knows that all this makes many of his party faithful deeply uneasy. ] Blair&apos;s tenure is known for an expansion of LGBT rights such as the introduction of legal civil partnerships. Blair himself has told the LGBT organization Stonewall that &quot; [w]hat has happened is that the culture of the country has changed in a definable way &quot; and that &quot; [i]t&apos;s a thing that doesn&apos;t just give me a lot of pride, but it has actually brought a lot of joy. &quot; Blair has also claimed to have got up off his seat and danced upon seeing the first partnership ceremonies on television.

Tory! Tory!, Blair is described as personally admiring Thatcher deeply and making the decision that she would be the first outside person he formally invited to visit him in 10 Downing Street. { BBC Four, } { Tory! Tory! Tory! } Historian and writer Paul Johnson famously quoted Thatcher as saying before the 1997 election that Britain had &quot; nothing to fear &quot; from a Blair ministry. Previous Prime Minister John Major was one of the original figures behind the Northern Ireland peace process that Blair continued, and both of them campaigned in support of the Good Friday Agreement. However, Blair later snubbed Major by declining to invite him to a 2007 joint address to the House of Lords and House of Commons on the peace process.

I think Margaret Thatcher had her unhinged moments. ] Blair criticized the Thatcher government&apos;s record on poverty and made that a key issue for Labour economic policy. He made the goal to eradicate child poverty in Britain within 20 years based on the fact that one-third of British children were in poverty post-Thatcher compared to the 9% rate in 1979 (although these statistics are disputed). [ The Economist http://www.economist.com/node/242036 Tony Blair’s war on poverty 23 September 1999 5 November 2011 ] Blair also abolished Section 28, and he created lot more pro-European initiatives compared to Thatcher. Blair was criticized by various Thatcherites such as John Redwood, Norman Tebbit and William Hague. In his autobiography published in 2010, titled A Journey, Blair remarked: [ Tony Blair A Journey 101 2010 Random House 978-0-307-37578-0 ] [ Relationship to later administrations ] [ July 2011 ] { World Bank / } { IMF meeting in 2002 } [ Blair–Brown deal ] Gordon Brown followed Blair as Prime Minister, after Brown&apos;s long tenure as the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Although viewed in the media as somewhat personally close, Blair later wrote in his autobiography A Journey that a &quot; maddening &quot; Brown effectively blackmail ed him while he was in 10 Downing Street. Blair accused Brown of orchestrating the investigation into the cash-for-honours scandal and stated that the personal animosity was so strong that it lead him to frequent drinking, a big change for Blair. Blair also has told journalist Andrew Marr that as their years working together went on, cooperation become &quot; hard going on impossible &quot;.

To the extent that they felt divided, it came mostly from differences in personality, background, and managing style.
