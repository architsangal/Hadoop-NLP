Records in 2003. The single version of &quot; Fight Test &quot; was released on June 23, 2003, peaking at #28 in the UK Singles Chart. The song is originally from the 2002 album &quot; Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. &quot; It is an enhanced CD, containing covers of Radiohead &apos;s &quot; Knives Out &quot;, Kylie Minogue &apos;s &quot; Can&apos;t Get You out of My Head &quot;, and Beck &apos;s &quot; The Golden Age. &quot; In addition, the EP includes two original songs. The UK version was a normal CD single, which also featured some previously unreleased songs. [ Plagiarism controversy ] &quot; Fight Test &quot; is musically very similar to Cat Stevens &apos;s 1970 song &quot; Father and Son. &quot; Stevens, now Yusuf Islam, is receiving royalties following a relatively non-contentious settlement.
