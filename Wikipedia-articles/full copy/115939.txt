The population was 5,239 at the 2000 census. Harpswell is composed of land contiguous with the rest of Cumberland County, called Harpswell Neck, as well as several large and small islands: Sebascodegan Island (locally known as Great Island), Orr&apos;s Island, and Bailey Island. Harpswell is part of the Portland – South Portland – Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area. [ History ] The Native Americans who originally inhabited Harpswell were part of the Abenaki. The Abenaki name for Harpswell Neck, then called West Harpswell, was Merriconeag or &quot; quick carrying place &quot;, a reference to the narrow peninsula &apos;s easy portage. The Abenaki name for Great Island was Erascohegan or Sebascodiggin, { History of Harpswell, Maine From A Gazetteer of the State of Maine By Geo. J. Varney Published by B. B. Russell, 57 Cornhill, Boston 1886 } which became by the late 1800s Sebascodegan Island. About 1659 Major Nicholas Shapleigh of Kittery, Maine, bought Merriconeag and Sebascodegan Island from the Abenaki, but because of Indian attacks, attempts to settle the area were abandoned until after Dummer&apos;s War. The Treaty of 1725 brought a truce and by 1731 many settlers had returned. [ Coolidge Austin J. John B.
