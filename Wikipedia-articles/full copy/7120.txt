[ 811 ] Calreticulin also known as calregulin, CRP55, CaBP3, calsequestrin-like protein, and endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 60 (ERp60) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CALR gene. [ McCauliffe DP, Zappi E, Lieu TS, Michalak M, Sontheimer RD, Capra JD A human Ro/SS-A autoantigen is the homologue of calreticulin and is highly homologous with onchocercal RAL-1 antigen and an aplysia &quot; memory molecule &quot; J.

Invest. 86 1 332–5 1990 July 2365822 296725 10.1172/JCI114704 ] [ Entrez Gene: calreticulin http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db%3Dgene%26amp%3BCmd%3DShowDetailView%26amp%3BTermToSearch%3D811 ] Calreticulin is a multifunctional protein that binds Ca 2+ ion s (a second messenger in signal transduction ), rendering it inactive. The Ca 2+ is bound with low affinity, but high capacity, and can be released on a signal (see inositol triphosphate ). Calreticulin is located in storage compartments associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. The term &quot; Mobilferrin &quot; [ Mobilferrin ] is considered to be the same as calreticulin by some sources. [ Beutler E, West C, Gelbart T HLA-H and associated proteins in patients with hemochromatosis Mol. Med. 3 6 397–402 1997 9234244 2230203 ] [ Function ] Calreticulin binds to misfolded proteins and prevents them from being exported from the Endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. A similar quality-control chaperone, calnexin, performs the same service for soluble proteins as does calreticulin. Both proteins, Calnexin and calreticulin, have the function of binding to oligosaccharide s containing terminal glucose residues, thereby targeting them for degradation. In normal cellular function, trimming of glucose residues off the core oligosaccharide added during N-linked glycosylation is a part of protein processing. If &quot; overseer &quot; enzymes note that residues are misfolded, proteins within the RER will re-add glucose residues so that other Calreticulin/Calnexin can bind to these proteins and prevent them from proceeding to the Golgi. This leads these aberrantly folded proteins down a path whereby they are targeted for degradation. Studies on transgenic mice reveal that calreticulin is cardiac embryonic gene that is essential during development.

Acta 1600 1–2 32–7 2002 November 12445456 ] [ Transcription regulation ] Calreticulin is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that it may have a role in transcription regulation. Calreticulin binds to the synthetic peptide KLGFFKR, which is almost identical to an amino acid sequence in the DNA-binding domain of the superfamily of nuclear receptor s. The amino terminus of calreticulin interacts with the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor and prevents the receptor from binding to its specific glucocorticoid response element. Calreticulin can inhibit the binding of androgen receptor to its hormone-responsive DNA element and can inhibit androgen receptor and retinoic acid receptor transcriptional activities in vivo, as well as retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Thus, calreticulin can act as an important modulator of the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear hormone receptors. [ Clinical significance ] Calreticulin binds to antibodies in certain sera of systemic lupus and Sjogren patients that contain anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with increased autoantibody titers against calreticulin, but calreticulin is not a Ro/SS-A antigen. Earlier papers referred to calreticulin as an Ro/SS-A antigen, but this was later disproven. Increased autoantibody titer against human calreticulin is found in infants with complete congenital heart block of both the IgG and IgM classes.

The reason why most of the cells are not destroyed, is the presence of another molecule with signal CD47, which blocks CRT. Hence antibodies that block CD47 might be useful as a cancer treatment. In mice models of myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, anti-CD47 were effective in clearing cancer cells while normal cells were unaffected.
