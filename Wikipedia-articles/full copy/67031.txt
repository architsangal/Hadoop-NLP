{ Sen. } { Paul Sarbanes ( } { D – } { MD ) and } { Rep. } { Michael G. Oxley ( } { R – } { OH-4 ), the co-sponsors of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act. } The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 ( [ 107 204 116 745 2002 07 29 ] ), also known as the &apos;Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act&apos; (in the Senate ) and &apos;Corporate and Auditing Accountability and Responsibility Act&apos; (in the House ) and more commonly called Sarbanes–Oxley, Sarbox or SOX, is a United States federal law that set new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, management and public accounting firms. It is named after sponsors U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes ( D - MD ) and U.S. Representative Michael G. Oxley ( R - OH ). The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals including those affecting Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems and WorldCom. These scandals, which cost investors billions of dollars when the share prices of affected companies collapsed, shook public confidence in the nation&apos;s securities markets. The act contains 11 titles, or sections, ranging from additional corporate board responsibilities to criminal penalties, and requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement rulings on requirements to comply with the law. Harvey Pitt, the 26th chairman of the SEC, led the SEC in the adoption of dozens of rules to implement the Sarbanes–Oxley Act. It created a new, quasi-public agency, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, charged with overseeing, regulating, inspecting and disciplining accounting firms in their roles as auditors of public companies. The act also covers issues such as auditor independence, corporate governance, internal control assessment, and enhanced financial disclosure. The nonprofit arm of Financial Executives International (FEI), Financial Executives Research Foundation (FERF), completed extensive research studies to help support the foundations of the act. The act was approved by the House by a vote of     423 in favor, 3 opposed, and 8 abstaining and by the Senate with a vote of     99 in favor, 1 abstaining. President George W. Bush signed it into law, stating it included &quot; the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The era of low standards and false profits is over; no boardroom in America is above or beyond the law.&apos;&apos; &quot; [ Elisabeth Bumiller Bush Signs Bill Aimed at Fraud in Corporations http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D9C01E0D91E38F932A05754C0A9649C8B63 The New York Times 2002-07-31 ] In response to the perception that stricter financial governance laws are needed, SOX-type laws have been subsequently enacted in Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Australia, India, South Africa, and Turkey. Debate continues over the perceived benefits and costs of SOX. Opponents of the bill claim it has reduced America&apos;s international competitive edge against foreign financial service providers, saying SOX has introduced an overly complex regulatory environment into U.S. financial markets. { A Mckinsey &amp; Company study commissioned by NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg and U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, (D-N.Y.), cites this as one reason America&apos;s financial sector is losing market share to other financial centers worldwide. Reference http://www.senate.gov/~schumer/SchumerWebsite/pressroom/special_reports/2007/NY_REPORT%20_FINAL.pdf } Proponents of the measure say that SOX has been a &quot; godsend &quot; for improving the confidence of fund managers and other investor s with regard to the veracity of corporate financial statements. { Reference this BusinessWeek article quoting fund managers at Eaton Vance and T. Rowe Price http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_05/b4019053.htm } [ Outlines ] Sarbanes–Oxley contains 11 titles that describe specific mandates and requirements for financial reporting. Each title consists of several sections, summarized below. Title I consists of nine sections and establishes the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, to provide independent oversight of public accounting firms providing audit services ( &quot; auditors &quot; ). It also creates a central oversight board tasked with registering auditors, defining the specific processes and procedures for compliance audits, inspecting and policing conduct and quality control, and enforcing compliance with the specific mandates of SOX. { Auditor Independence } Title II consists of nine sections and establishes standards for external auditor independence, to limit conflicts of interest. It also addresses new auditor approval requirements, audit partner rotation, and auditor reporting requirements. It restricts auditing companies from providing non-audit services (e.g., consulting) for the same clients. { Corporate Responsibility } Title III consists of eight sections and mandates that senior executives take individual responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of corporate financial reports. It defines the interaction of external auditors and corporate audit committees, and specifies the responsibility of corporate officers for the accuracy and validity of corporate financial reports. It enumerates specific limits on the behaviors of corporate officers and describes specific forfeitures of benefits and civil penalties for non-compliance. For example, Section 302 requires that the company&apos;s &quot; principal officers &quot; (typically the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer ) certify and approve the integrity of their company financial reports quarterly. Kuschnik, Bernhard; The Sarbanes Oxley Act: &quot; Big Brother is watching &quot; you or Adequate Measures of Corporate Governance Regulation? 5 Rutgers Business Law Journal [2008], 64–95; available at http://businesslaw.newark.rutgers.edu/RBLJ_vol5_no1_kuschnik.pdf { Enhanced Financial Disclosures } Title IV consists of nine sections. It describes enhanced reporting requirements for financial transactions, including off-balance-sheet transactions, pro-forma figures and stock transactions of corporate officers. It requires internal controls for assuring the accuracy of financial reports and disclosures, and mandates both audits and reports on those controls. It also requires timely reporting of material changes in financial condition and specific enhanced reviews by the SEC or its agents of corporate reports. { Analyst Conflicts of Interest } Title V consists of only one section, which includes measures designed to help restore investor confidence in the reporting of securities analysts. It defines the codes of conduct for securities analysts and requires disclosure of knowable conflicts of interest. { Commission Resources and Authority } Title VI consists of four sections and defines practices to restore investor confidence in securities analysts. It also defines the SEC’s authority to censure or bar securities professionals from practice and defines conditions under which a person can be barred from practicing as a broker, advisor, or dealer. { Studies and Reports } Title VII consists of five sections and requires the Comptroller General and the SEC to perform various studies and report their findings. Studies and reports include the effects of consolidation of public accounting firms, the role of credit rating agencies in the operation of securities markets, securities violations and enforcement actions, and whether investment banks assisted Enron, Global Crossing and others to manipulate earnings and obfuscate true financial conditions. { Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability } Title VIII consists of seven sections and is also referred to as the “Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002”. It describes specific criminal penalties for manipulation, destruction or alteration of financial records or other interference with investigations, while providing certain protections for whistle-blowers. { White Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement } Title IX consists of six sections. This section is also called the “White Collar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002.” This section increases the criminal penalties associated with white-collar crime s and conspiracies. It recommends stronger sentencing guidelines and specifically adds failure to certify corporate financial reports as a criminal offense. { Corporate Tax Returns } Title X consists of one section. Section 1001 states that the Chief Executive Officer should sign the company tax return. { Corporate Fraud Accountability } Title XI consists of seven sections. Section 1101 recommends a name for this title as “Corporate Fraud Accountability Act of 2002”. It identifies corporate fraud and records tampering as criminal offenses and joins those offenses to specific penalties. It also revises sentencing guidelines and strengthens their penalties. This enables the SEC to resort to temporarily freezing transactions or payments that have been deemed &quot; large &quot; or &quot; unusual &quot;. [ History and context: events contributing to the adoption of Sarbanes–Oxley ] A variety of complex factors created the conditions and culture in which a series of large corporate frauds occurred between 2000–2002. The spectacular, highly-publicized frauds at Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco exposed significant problems with conflicts of interest and incentive compensation practices. The analysis of their complex and contentious root causes contributed to the passage of SOX in 2002. { Farrell, Greg. &quot; America Robbed Blind. &quot; Wizard Academy Press: 2005 } In a 2004 interview, Senator Paul Sarbanes stated: [ http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NXD/is_1_11/ai_n25101748/print?tag%3DartBody%3Bcol1 Sarbanes Interview Findarticles.com 2010-08-27 Nance Lucas 2004 ] Auditor conflicts of interest: Prior to SOX, auditing firms, the primary financial &quot; watchdogs &quot; for investors, were self-regulated. They also performed significant non-audit or consulting work for the companies they audited. Many of these consulting agreements were far more lucrative than the auditing engagement. This presented at least the appearance of a conflict of interest. For example, challenging the company&apos;s accounting approach might damage a client relationship, conceivably placing a significant consulting arrangement at risk, damaging the auditing firm&apos;s bottom line. Boardroom failures: Boards of Directors, specifically Audit Committees, are charged with establishing oversight mechanisms for financial reporting in U.S. corporations on the behalf of investors. These scandals identified Board members who either did not exercise their responsibilities or did not have the expertise to understand the complexities of the businesses. In many cases, Audit Committee members were not truly independent of management. Securities analysts&apos; conflicts of interest: The roles of securities analysts, who make buy and sell recommendations on company stocks and bonds, and investment bankers, who help provide companies loans or handle mergers and acquisitions, provide opportunities for conflicts. Similar to the auditor conflict, issuing a buy or sell recommendation on a stock while providing lucrative investment banking services creates at least the appearance of a conflict of interest. [ http://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/budgetact.htm SEC Annual Budget Sec.gov 2009-06-23 2010-08-27 ] Inadequate funding of the SEC: The SEC budget has steadily increased to nearly double the pre-SOX level. In the interview cited above, Sarbanes indicated that enforcement and rule-making are more effective post-SOX. Banking practices: Lending to a firm sends signals to investors regarding the firm&apos;s risk. In the case of Enron, several major banks provided large loans to the company without understanding, or while ignoring, the risks of the company. Investors of these banks and their clients were hurt by such bad loans, resulting in large settlement payments by the banks. Others interpreted the willingness of banks to lend money to the company as an indication of its health and integrity, and were led to invest in Enron as a result. These investors were hurt as well. Internet bubble : Investors had been stung in 2000 by the sharp declines in technology stocks and to a lesser extent, by declines in the overall market. Certain mutual fund managers were alleged to have advocated the purchasing of particular technology stocks, while quietly selling them. The losses sustained also helped create a general anger among investors. [ http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch220.txt SEC Levitt Speech The Numbers Game 2010-08-27 ] Executive compensation: Stock option and bonus practices, combined with volatility in stock prices for even small earnings &quot; misses, &quot; resulted in pressures to manage earnings. Stock options were not treated as compensation expense by companies, encouraging this form of compensation. With a large stock-based bonus at risk, managers were pressured to meet their targets. [ Timeline and passage of Sarbanes–Oxley ] { George W. Bush met with Senator } { Paul Sarbanes, } { Secretary of Labor } { Elaine Chao and other dignitaries in the } { Blue Room at the } { White House on July 30, 2002 } The House passed Rep. Oxley&apos;s bill (H.R. 3763) on April 24, 2002, by a vote of 334 to 90. The House then referred the &quot; Corporate and Auditing Accountability, Responsibility, and Transparency Act &quot; or &quot; CAARTA &quot; to the Senate Banking Committee with the support of President George W. Bush and the SEC. At the time, however, the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), was preparing his own proposal, Senate Bill 2673. Senator Sarbanes’ bill passed the Senate Banking Committee on June 18, 2002, by a vote of 17 to 4. On June 25, 2002, WorldCom revealed it had overstated its earnings by more than $3.8 billion during the past five quarters (15 months), primarily by improperly accounting for its operating costs. Sen. Sarbanes introduced Senate Bill 2673 to the full Senate that same day, and it passed 97–0 less than three weeks later on July 15, 2002. The House and the Senate formed a Conference Committee to reconcile the differences between Sen. Sarbanes&apos;s bill (S. 2673) and Rep. Oxley&apos;s bill (H.R. 3763). The conference committee relied heavily on S. 2673 and “most changes made by the conference committee strengthened the prescriptions of S. 2673 or added new prescriptions.” (John T. Bostelman, The Sarbanes–Oxley Deskbook § 2–31.) The Committee approved the final conference bill on July 24, 2002, and gave it the name &quot; the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002. &quot; The next day, both houses of Congress voted on it without change, producing an overwhelming margin of victory: 423 to 3 in the House and 99 to 0 in the Senate. On July 30, 2002, President George W. Bush signed it into law, stating it included &quot; the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt. &quot; [ Analyzing the cost-benefits of Sarbanes–Oxley ] A significant body of academic research and opinion exists regarding the costs and benefits of SOX, with significant differences in conclusions. This is due in part to the difficulty of isolating the impact of SOX from other variables affecting the stock market and corporate earnings.

These costs have continued to decline relative to revenues since 2004. The 2007 study indicated that, for 168 companies with average revenues of $4.7 billion, the average compliance costs were $1.7 million (0.036% of revenue). The 2006 study indicated that, for 200 companies with average revenues of $6.8 billion, the average compliance costs were $2.9 million (0.043% of revenue), down 23% from 2005. Cost for decentralized companies (i.e., those with multiple segments or divisions) were considerably more than centralized companies. Survey scores related to the positive effect of SOX on investor confidence, reliability of financial statements, and fraud prevention continue to rise. However, when asked in 2006 whether the benefits of compliance with Section 404 have exceeded costs in 2006, only 22 percent agreed. FEI 2006 Survey of SOX 404 Costs Foley &amp; Lardner Survey (2007): This annual study focused on changes in the total costs of being a U.S. public company, which were significantly affected by SOX. Such costs include external auditor fees, directors and officers (D &amp; O) insurance, board compensation, lost productivity, and legal costs. Each of these cost categories increased significantly between FY2001 and FY2006. Nearly 70% of survey respondents indicated public companies with revenues under $251 million should be exempt from SOX Section 404. Butler/Ribstein (2006): Their book proposed a comprehensive overhaul or repeal of SOX and a variety of other reforms. For example, they indicate that investors could diversify their stock investments, efficiently managing the risk of a few catastrophic corporate failures, whether due to fraud or competition. However, if each company is required to spend a significant amount of money and resources on SOX compliance, this cost is borne across all publicly traded companies and therefore cannot be diversified away by the investor. A 2011 SEC study found that Section 404(b) compliance costs have continued to decline, especially after 2007 accounting guidance. &quot; Study and Recommendations on Section 404(b) &quot;.

[ Effects on exchange listing choice of non-U.S. companies ] Some have asserted that Sarbanes–Oxley legislation has helped displace business from New York to London, where the Financial Services Authority regulates the financial sector with a lighter touch. In the UK, the non-statutory Combined Code of Corporate Governance plays a somewhat similar role to SOX. See Howell E. Jackson &amp; Mark J. Roe, “Public Enforcement of Securities Laws: Preliminary Evidence” (Working Paper January 16, 2007). London based Alternative Investment Market claims that its spectacular growth in listings almost entirely coincided with the Sarbanes Oxley legislation. In December 2006 Michael Bloomberg, New York&apos;s mayor, and Charles Schumer, a U.S. senator from New York, expressed their concern. { Bloomberg-Schumer report } [ August 2010 ] The Sarbanes–Oxley Act&apos;s effect on non-U.S. companies cross-listed in the U.S. is different on firms from developed and well regulated countries than on firms from less developed countries according to Kate Litvak. [ http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id%3D876624 SSRN-The Effect of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act on Non-U.S. Companies Cross-Listed in the U.S. by Kate Litvak Papers.ssrn.com 2010-08-27 ] Companies from badly regulated countries see benefits that are higher than the costs from better credit ratings by complying to regulations in a highly regulated country (USA), but companies from developed countries only incur the costs, since transparency is adequate in their home countries as well. On the other hand, the benefit of better credit rating also comes with listing on other stock exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange. Piotroski and Srinivasan (2008) examine a comprehensive sample of international companies that list onto U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges before and after the enactment of the Act in 2002. Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K. exchanges from 1995–2006, they find that the listing preferences of large foreign firms choosing between U.S. exchanges and the LSE&apos;s Main Market did not change following SOX. In contrast, they find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms choosing between the Nasdaq and LSE&apos;s Alternative Investment Market decreased following SOX. The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance. The screening of smaller firms with weaker governance attributes from U.S. exchanges is consistent with the heightened governance costs imposed by the Act increasing the bonding-related benefits of a U.S. listing. { Piotroski, Joseph D. and Srinivasan, Suraj, Regulation and Bonding: The Sarbanes–Oxley Act and the Flow of International Listings(January 2008). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=956987 } [ Implementation of key provisions ] [ Sarbanes–Oxley Section 302: Disclosure controls ] Under Sarbanes–Oxley, two separate sections came into effect—one civil and the other criminal. [ 15 7241 ] (Section 302) (civil provision); [ 18 1350 ] (Section 906) (criminal provision). Section 302 of the Act mandates a set of internal procedures designed to ensure accurate financial disclosure. The signing officers must certify that they are “responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control s ” and “have designed such internal controls to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to such officers by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the periodic reports are being prepared.” [ 15 7241 a 4 ]. The officers must “have evaluated the effectiveness of the company ’s internal controls as of a date within 90 days prior to the report” and “have presented in the report their conclusions about the effectiveness of their internal controls based on their evaluation as of that date.” Id.. The SEC interpreted the intention of Sec. 302 in Final Rule 33–8124. In it, the SEC defines the new term &quot; disclosure controls and procedures, &quot; which are distinct from &quot; internal control s over financial reporting. &quot; [ http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8124.htm Final Rule: Certification of Disclosure in Companies&apos; Quarterly and Annual Reports Sec.gov 2010-08-27 ] Under both Section 302 and Section 404, Congress directed the SEC to promulgate regulations enforcing these provisions. [ http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8238.htm SEC Final Rules 33–8238 Sec.gov 2010-08-27 ] External auditors are required to issue an opinion on whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects by management. This is in addition to the financial statement opinion regarding the accuracy of the financial statements. The requirement to issue a third opinion regarding management&apos;s assessment was removed in 2007. [ Sarbanes–Oxley Section 303: Improper Influence on Conduct of Audits ] a.Rules To Prohibit. It shall be unlawful, in contravention of such rules or regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, for any officer or director of an issuer, or any other person acting under the direction thereof, to take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead any independent public or certified accountant engaged in the performance of an audit of the financial statements of that issuer for the purpose of rendering such financial statements materially misleading. [ Sarbanes-Oxley Section 401: Disclosures in periodic reports (Off-balance sheet items) ] The bankruptcy of Enron drew attention to off-balance sheet instruments that were used fraudulently. During 2010, the court examiner&apos;s review of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy also brought these instruments back into focus, as Lehman had used an instrument called &quot; Repo 105 &quot; to allegedly move assets and debt off-balance sheet to make its financial position look more favorable to investors. Sarbanes-Oxley required the disclosure of all material off-balance sheet items. It also required an SEC study and report to better understand the extent of usage of such instruments and whether accounting principles adequately addressed these instruments; the SEC report was issued June 15, 2005.

Dana yes Thomas Ross ] [ Sarbanes–Oxley Section 404: Assessment of internal control ] [ SOX 404 top-down risk assessment ] The most contentious aspect of SOX is Section 404, which requires management and the external auditor to report on the adequacy of the company&apos;s internal control on financial reporting (ICFR). This is the most costly aspect of the legislation for companies to implement, as documenting and testing important financial manual and automated controls requires enormous effort. { See New Center for Data Analysis Report } [ August 2010 ] Under Section 404 of the Act, management is required to produce an “internal control report” as part of each annual Exchange Act report. See [ 15 7262 ]. The report must affirm “the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.” [ 15 7262 a ]. The report must also “contain an assessment, as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of the Company, of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting.” To do this, managers are generally adopting an internal control framework such as that described in COSO. To help alleviate the high costs of compliance, guidance and practice have continued to evolve. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) approved Audit ing Standard No. 5 for public accounting firms on July 25, 2007. { PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5 } This standard superseded Auditing Standard No. 2, the initial guidance provided in 2004. The SEC also released its interpretive guidance [ http://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2007/33-8810.pdf SEC Interpretive Release: Commission Guidance Regarding Management&apos;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 PDF 2010-08-27 ] on June 27, 2007. It is generally consistent with the PCAOB&apos;s guidance, but intended to provide guidance for management. Both management and the external auditor are responsible for performing their assessment in the context of a top-down risk assessment, which requires management to base both the scope of its assessment and evidence gathered on risk. This gives management wider discretion in its assessment approach. These two standards together require management to: Assess both the design and operating effectiveness of selected internal controls related to significant accounts and relevant assertions, in the context of material misstatement risks; Understand the flow of transactions, including IT aspects, in sufficient detail to identify points at which a misstatement could arise; Evaluate company-level (entity-level) controls, which correspond to the components of the COSO framework; Perform a fraud risk assessment; Evaluate controls designed to prevent or detect fraud, including management override of controls; Evaluate controls over the period-end financial reporting process; Scale the assessment based on the size and complexity of the company; Rely on management&apos;s work based on factors such as competency, objectivity, and risk; Conclude on the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting. SOX 404 compliance costs represent a tax on inefficiency, encouraging companies to centralize and automate their financial reporting systems. This is apparent in the comparative costs of companies with decentralized operations and systems, versus those with centralized, more efficient systems. For example, the 2007 FEI survey indicated average compliance costs for decentralized companies were $1.9 million, while centralized company costs were $1.3 million. [ http://fei.mediaroom.com/index.php?s%3D43%26amp%3Bitem%3D204 FEI Survey 2007 Fei.mediaroom.com 2008-04-30 2010-08-27 ] Costs of evaluating manual control procedures are dramatically reduced through automation. [ Sarbanes–Oxley 404 and smaller public companies ] The cost of complying with SOX 404 impacts smaller companies disproportionately, as there is a significant fixed cost involved in completing the assessment. For example, during 2004 U.S. companies with revenues exceeding $5 billion spent 0.06% of revenue on SOX compliance, while companies with less than $100 million in revenue spent 2.55%.

The SEC issued their guidance to management in June, 2007. After the SEC and PCAOB issued their guidance, the SEC required smaller public companies (non-accelerated filers) with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2007 to document a Management Assessment of their Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR). Outside auditors of non-accelerated filers however opine or test internal controls under PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) Auditing Standards for years ending after December 15, 2008. Another extension was granted by the SEC for the outside auditor assessment until years ending after December 15, 2009. The reason for the timing disparity was to address the House Committee on Small Business concern that the cost of complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 was still unknown and could therefore be disproportionately high for smaller publicly held companies.

The SEC stated in their release that the extension was granted so that the SEC’s Office of Economic Analysis could complete a study of whether additional guidance provided to company managers and auditors in 2007 was effective in reducing the costs of compliance. They also stated that there will be no further extensions in the future.

In an April 14, 2005 speech before the U.S. House of Representatives, Paul stated, &quot; These regulations are damaging American capital markets by providing an incentive for small US firms and foreign firms to deregister from US stock exchanges. According to a study by a researcher at the Wharton Business School, the number of American companies deregistering from public stock exchanges nearly tripled during the year after Sarbanes–Oxley became law, while the New York Stock Exchange had only 10 new foreign listings in all of 2004. The reluctance of small businesses and foreign firms to register on American stock exchanges is easily understood when one considers the costs Sarbanes–Oxley imposes on businesses. According to a survey by Korn/Ferry International, Sarbanes–Oxley cost Fortune 500 companies an average of $5.1 million in compliance expenses in 2004, while a study by the law firm of Foley and Lardner found the Act increased costs associated with being a publicly held company by 130 percent. &quot; { Repeal Sarbanes-Oxley!

During the financial crisis of 2007–2010, critics blamed Sarbanes–Oxley for the low number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on American stock exchanges during 2008. In November 2008, Newt Gingrich and co-author David W. Kralik called on Congress to repeal Sarbanes–Oxley. [ Newt Gingrich,David W.

The CEO and CFO are now required to unequivocally take ownership for their financial statements under Section 302, which was not the case prior to SOX. Further, auditor conflicts of interest have been addressed, by prohibiting auditors from also having lucrative consulting agreements with the firms they audit under Section 201.
