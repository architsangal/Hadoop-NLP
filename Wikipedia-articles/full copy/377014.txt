He is best remembered for his success at Arsenal, as a player in the 1970s and then as manager from 1986 until 1995. [ Early life ] The youngest of seven children, Graham grew up in poverty in Bargeddie, near Coatbridge. He was raised by his mother, Janet, after his father, Robert Young Graham, died of tuberculosis and heart failure on Christmas Day 1944, when George was not yet a month old. His elder sister also died of Tuberculosis at the age of 19, in 1951. When growing up, Graham showed considerable promise as a footballer, and Newcastle United, Chelsea and Aston Villa displayed an interest in the young Graham. { Graham, George [1995] &quot; The Glory and the Grief &quot; } [ Playing career ] Despite being Scottish, Graham played exclusively in England and the United States. He signed for Aston Villa in 1961, on his 17th birthday. He spent three seasons at the Birmingham club, but only made eight appearances  – though one of them was the club&apos;s 1963 League Cup final loss to Birmingham City. Chelsea signed him in July 1964 for £5000. Graham scored 35 goals in 72 league games for the club and won a League Cup medal in 1965 but he, along with several other Chelsea players, increasingly clashed with their volatile manager Tommy Docherty. This culminated in Graham and seven others being sent home and disciplined by Docherty for breaking a pre-match curfew in 1965. Bertie Mee &apos;s Arsenal were looking for a replacement for Joe Baker, and paid £75,000 plus Tommy Baldwin in 1966 to bring him to Highbury. He made his debut on 1 October 1966 at home to Leicester City, and although the result was a 4–2 defeat he immediately became a regular in the Arsenal side. He was Arsenal&apos;s top scorer in both 1966–67 and 1967–68, having started out as a centre forward for the club, but later moved to inside forward with John Radford moving from the wing to up front. With Arsenal, Graham was a runner-up in both the 1968 and 1969 League Cup finals, before finally winning a medal with the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. He followed it up with being an integral part of Arsenal&apos;s Double -winning side of 1970–71, and even had a claim to scoring Arsenal&apos;s equaliser in the FA Cup Final against Liverpool, although Eddie Kelly is officially credited with the goal. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1321973.stm 1971 – King George of Wembley BBC Sport 10 May 2001 4 January 2010 ] Winning the Double brought the attention of Scotland and Graham was selected for the national side for the first time against Portugal on 13 October 1971. He would go on to win twelve caps over the next two years for Scotland, scoring three goals, his final one coming against Brazil on 30 June 1973. By then, however, Graham was no longer an Arsenal player. The arrival of Alan Ball midway through 1971–72 had made his place in the Arsenal side less assured and he therefore moved for £120,000 to Manchester United in December 1972. In total, he played 308 matches for Arsenal, scoring 77 goals. He spent two years at United, and was relegated to Division Two, before seeing out his career in England at Portsmouth and Crystal Palace. He played the summer of 1978 in America for the California Surf.

On 6 December 1982 Graham was appointed manager of Millwall, who were then bottom of the old Third Division. Graham turned the side around in a short space of time—they avoided relegation that season and in 1984–85 they were promoted to the old Second Division. After he left the club in 1986, they went on to win the Second Division and win promotion to the First in 1987–88. [ Arsenal ] Graham&apos;s achievements at Millwall attracted attention from bigger clubs, and with the dismissal of Don Howe as Arsenal manager in March 1986, the Arsenal directors were interested in appointing Alex Ferguson, the Aberdeen manager, as their new manager with Graham as his assistant. However, Ferguson (then in temporary charge of the Scotland national football team following the death of Jock Stein the previous September, and still in charge of Aberdeen) had decided to wait until after the World Cup that summer before deciding on his future, and so the Arsenal directors appointed Graham as their new manager on 14 May 1986. { &quot; Sir Alex Ferguson turned down Arsenal job back in 1986 &quot;. Mirror Football.10 June 2009. Retrieved 1 June 2012. } A month after arriving at Arsenal, Graham was linked with the job as manager of the Scotland national team, but the job went to Andy Roxburgh instead. { &quot; Fergie Steps down &quot;. Evening Times. 16 June 1986. Retrieved 1 June 2012. } Arsenal had not won a trophy since the FA Cup in 1978–79, and were drifting away from the top teams in the League. Graham cleared out much of the old guard and replaced them with new signings and players promoted from the youth team, while imposing much stricter discipline than his predecessors, both in the dressing room and on the pitch. Arsenal&apos;s form immediately improved, so much so that the club were top of the League at Christmas 1986, the club&apos;s centenary, for the first time in a decade. Arsenal finished fourth in Graham&apos;s first season in charge, and they went on to win the 1987 League Cup. While Arsenal lost the League Cup final the following year (a shocking 3–2 defeat to Luton Town ), their League form steadily improved. Graham&apos;s side featured tight defensive discipline, embodied by his young captain Tony Adams, who along with Lee Dixon, Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn, formed the basis of the club&apos;s defence for over a decade. However, contrary to popular belief, during this time Graham&apos;s Arsenal were not a purely defensive side; Graham also employed capable midfielders such as David Rocastle, Michael Thomas and Paul Merson, and striker Alan Smith, whose prolific goalscoring regularly brought him more than 20 goals per season. At the end of Graham&apos;s third season ( 1988–89 ), the club won their first League title since 1971 (when Graham had been an Arsenal player), in highly dramatic fashion, in the final game of the season against Liverpool at Anfield; Arsenal needed to win by two goals to take the title; Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 1–0, but as time ticked by Arsenal struggled to get a second, and with 90 minutes gone on the clock, Arsenal still needed another goal. With only seconds to go, a Smith flick-on found Michael Thomas surging through the Liverpool defence; the young midfielder calmly lifted the ball over Bruce Grobbelaar and into the net, and Arsenal were League Champions. After finishing fourth in 1990, Graham signed goalkeeper David Seaman and Swedish winger Anders Limpar in the close season; both players proved vital as Arsenal won a second title in 1990–91 and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, losing to arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Arsenal had finished ahead of runners-up Liverpool in the race for the league title that season, and in February of that season Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish had suddenly announced his resignation as manager – and Graham&apos;s name was among those mentioned by the media as a possible successor to Dalglish. However, Graham was quick to rule himself out of the running, and the job went to Graeme Souness instead. Graham went on to sign striker and eventual second all-time top scorer Ian Wright from Crystal Palace in the autumn of 1991, and the club&apos;s first entry in the European Cup for 20 years (they had been unable to compete in the 1989-90 tournament due to the ban on English clubs in European competitions arising from the Heysel disaster of 1985). However, the European Cup adventure was short-lived. Arsenal were knocked out by S.L. Benfica in the second round and failed to make the lucrative group stage. 1991-92 brought more disappointment when the Gunners were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by lowly Wrexham, though Arsenal did reasonably well in the league and finished fourth. After this season, Graham changed his tactics; he became more defensive and turned out far less attack-minded sides, which depended mainly on goals from Wright rather than the whole team. Between 1986–87 and 1991–92 Arsenal averaged 66 League goals a season (scoring 81 in 1991–92), but between 1992–93 and 1994–95 only averaged 48; { Statistics sourced from } [ http://www.fchd.info/ARSENAL.HTM Arsenal Football Club History Database September 21 2006 ] this included just 40 in 1992–93, when the club finished 10th in the inaugural season of the FA Premier League, scoring fewer than any other team in the division. [ http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng93.html England 1992/93 RSSSF September 21, 2006 ] Graham&apos;s Arsenal became Cup specialists, and in 1992–93 Arsenal became the first side to win the FA Cup and League Cup double, both times Arsenal beating Sheffield Wednesday, 2–1 in the League Cup Final and 2–1 after a replay in the FA Cup Final replay. The next season they continued in the same vein, winning the UEFA Cup Winners&apos; Cup, their second European trophy; in the final Arsenal beat favourites and holders Parma 1–0 with a tight defensive performance and Alan Smith&apos;s 21st minute goal from a left foot volley. The 1994 Cup Winners&apos; Cup proved to be George Graham&apos;s last trophy at the club; the following February he was sacked after nearly nine years in charge, after it was discovered he had accepted an illegal £425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge following Arsenal&apos;s 1992 acquisition of John Jensen and Pål Lydersen, two of Hauge&apos;s clients. Graham was eventually banned for a year by the Football Association for his involvement in the scandal, after he admitted he had received an &quot; unsolicited gift &quot; from Hauge.

He took over a Leeds team that was struggling against relegation at the time and his first priority was the defence; although Leeds scored fewer goals than any other Premiership club (28) they still finished in a secure 13th place. Bringing in players such as Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the close season, 1997–98 saw Leeds score twice as many goals as the previous season finish fifth in the Premiership and secure UEFA Cup qualification. [ Tottenham Hotspur ] In October 1998 Graham&apos;s two-year spell as Leeds manager came to an end when he was appointed manager of Tottenham Hotspur. Just five months after taking charge he guided the club to victory over Leicester City in the 1999 League Cup Final, and with it a place in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup. He was sacked on 15 March 2001, soon after the club had been purchased by ENIC, for alleged breach of contract. The club stated that Graham had been issued &quot; several written warnings prior to his sacking for giving out what was deemed by the club as being private information &quot; before, earlier that week, apparently informing the media he had &quot; a limited budget &quot; for new players and expressing his disappointment with it. This led to his being summoned to a meeting with Spurs executive vice-chairman David Buchler, after which he was dismissed. Buchler subsequently questioned whether Graham had the interests of the club at heart and described his conduct in the meeting as &quot; aggressive and defiant &quot;. Graham&apos;s legal representatives issued a statement expressing he was &quot; shocked and upset to have been sacked and could not believe such a flimsy excuse was given &quot;. It went on to say that Graham &quot; believes ENIC always intended to sack him. &quot; [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/1225092.stm Graham sacked by Tottenham BBC Sport 10 May 2001 26 January 2011 ] [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/3000989/Hoddle-set-to-return-home-as-Spurs-end-Graham-era.html Hoddle set to return `home&apos; as Spurs end Graham era The Telegraph Sam Wallace Christopher Davies and 16 March 2001 January 26, 2011 London ] Despite guiding the club to its first trophy in eight seasons, Graham could not achieve a finish higher than tenth in the Premiership and remained unpopular with a large section of the supporters, because of his previous role at Arsenal, Tottenham&apos;s most bitter rivals. [ Since 2001 ] He has been out of management ever since, concentrating on his career as a football pundit for Sky Sports. However, he was linked with several managerial vacancies after leaving Tottenham. In October 2001, following the dismissal of Peter Taylor at Leicester City, he was linked with that vacancy, but it was filled by Dave Bassett instead.

In the 2003 close season, the resignation of Graham Taylor at Aston Villa saw Graham&apos;s name mentioned by the media as a possible successor, but again nothing came of it, with this vacancy being filled by David O&apos;Leary, who had played under Graham at Arsenal and worked as his assistant at Leeds.
