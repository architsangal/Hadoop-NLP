Antar, Co-founder Sam E. Antar, CFO Public ( NASDAQ : CRZY) ] Crazy Eddie is the name of a consumer electronics retailer conducting business through the Internet and by telephone. The venture is the most recent to be doing business under the Crazy Eddie name, with the most well known (and later infamous) being a chain of retail stores that operated throughout New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut for nearly twenty years. Crazy Eddie was started in 1971 in Brooklyn, New York by businessmen Eddie and Sam M. Antar as ERS Electronics, named after Eddie, his cousin Ronnie (Ronnie Gindi, a partner), and his father Sam. The chain rose to prominence throughout the Tri-State Region as much for its prices as for its memorable radio and television commercials, featuring a frenetic, &quot; crazy &quot; character played by radio DJ Jerry Carroll (who copied most of his shtick from early TV-commercial pioneer, used car and electronics salesman Earl &quot; Madman &quot; Muntz ). At its peak, Crazy Eddie had 43 stores in the chain, and earned more than $300 million in sales. [ Only in New York (Part 2) http://www.totalmedia.com/trivia_32.asp September 7, 2006 ] In February 1987, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey commenced a federal grand jury investigation into the warranty billing practices of Crazy Eddie. In September of that year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation into alleged violations of federal securities laws by certain Crazy Eddie officers and employees. Eddie Antar was eventually charged with a series of crimes. Unable to sustain his fraudulent business practices, co-founder Eddie Antar cashed in millions of dollars worth of stock and resigned from the company in December 1986. Crazy Eddie&apos;s board of directors lost control of the company in November 1987 after a proxy battle with a group led by Elias Zinn and Victor Palmieri, known as the Oppenheimer-Palmieri Group. The entire Antar family was immediately removed from the business. The new owners quickly discovered the true extent of the Antar family&apos;s fraud, but were unable to turn around Crazy Eddie&apos;s quickly declining fortunes. In 1989, the company declared bankruptcy and was liquidated. Crazy Eddie became a known symbol for corporate fraud in its time, but has since been eclipsed by the Enron, Worldcom and Bernie Madoff accounting scandals. Antar fled to Israel in February 1990, but was returned to the United States in January 1993 to stand trial. His 1993 conviction on fraud charges was overturned, but he eventually pleaded guilty in 1996. In 1997, Antar was sentenced to eight years in prison and paid large fines. He was released from prison in 1999. [ Crazy Eddie&apos; Antar&apos;s not so &apos;insane&apos; view of the world June 24, 2007 MarketWatch Herb Greenberg http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/crazy-eddie-antars-not-so/story.aspx?guid%3D%7B5A237EB8-0D70-48F8-A861-E0EC37A409EB%7D ] [ Franchise history ] [ Beginnings ] Eddie Antar’s grandparents, Murad and Tera Antar, who were Syrian Jews, moved to New York from Aleppo, Syria. Murad and Tera worked in their market stalls alongside Arabs, including Egyptians, other Syrians, as well as Turks. Eddie&apos;s father Sam Antar was a retailer, and it was no surprise to the family that Eddie followed in his father&apos;s and grandparents&apos; footsteps. { Wells, Joseph T. Frankensteins of Fraud: The 20th Century&apos;s Top Ten White-Collar Criminals. Obsidian Pub. Co., 2000. ISBN 1-889277-25-8 } A Crazy Eddie T-shirt. These and other promotional items were always given away free of charge at grand openings. The predecessor to Crazy Eddie was a consumer electronics store called Sight and Sound. It was a property of ERS Electronics, a company owned by Sam M. Antar, his son Eddie Antar, and Eddie&apos;s cousin Ronnie Gindi. Sight and Sound, located on Kings Highway in Brooklyn, opened its doors in 1969 and offered electronics at regular prices. Due to his extremely aggressive sales techniques, Eddie quickly became known as &quot; Crazy Eddie. &quot; Despite his technique, or perhaps owing to it, within 18 months the store (as well as Eddie and Ronnie) was nearly bankrupt. Eddie Antar bought out Gindi&apos;s one-third ownership stake of Sight and Sound, and Sam M. Antar retained his one-third stake but left the day-to-day operations to Eddie. In 1971, the Sight and Sound store on Kings Highway was renamed Crazy Eddie. Eddie continued his high-pressure sales tactics with the renamed Crazy Eddie store, but this time met with success. Eventually, Eddie closed that location and moved to a bigger store, just a few blocks from Sight and Sound&apos;s old location. In 1973, Antar opened the second Crazy Eddie location in Syosset, New York. A third followed in 1975, located in Manhattan. That year, Antar established a corporate headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. [ Advertising ] Crazy Eddie was known for its humorous advertising campaign, featuring Jerry Carroll. An essential part of Crazy Eddie&apos;s success was its advertising campaign. In 1972, WPIX-FM late-night disc jockey Jerry &quot; Dr. Jerry &quot; Carroll ended a live commercial with the now-famous slogan, &quot; Crazy Eddie, his prices are IN-SA-A-A-A-A-ANE! &quot; Antar called in and told Carroll to say the line the same way every time. Beginning in 1975, Carroll starred in a series of humorous television commercials, each ending with the same frenetic slogan. Among the more memorable promotions featured by Crazy Eddie was the annual &quot; Christmas in August &quot; sale. In the 1980s, more than 7,500 unique radio and television ads were aired in the Tri-State Region. Carroll&apos;s acting was so convincing, and he became so identified with the company that many people thought he was actually Crazy Eddie. One commercial spoofing Superman implied that Carroll really was Crazy Eddie; this drew the ire of Warner Communications, the parent company of the distributor of the Superman film series, who sued the chain over the commercial. Eddie Antar countered by threatening to stop selling Atari video games and systems at Crazy Eddie stores; Warner Communications was Atari&apos;s parent at the time and Crazy Eddie was its largest customer. The suit was eventually settled.

[ http://www.lanesarasohn.com/tvwriter/tribune.html NNTN-Chicago Tribune Review ] Carroll and the commercials became significant 80s icons, with the commercials often appearing in the background of films of the time, including Splash. [ Anthony Ramirez The media business: advertising; the man folks thought was Crazy Eddie is back. He seems saner. http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res%3D990CE4DF1638F93BA2575BC0A963958260 The New York Times 1995-08-18 2008-05-19 ] [ Fraud ] Almost from the beginning, Crazy Eddie&apos;s management was engaged in various forms of fraud. The Antars deliberately falsified their books to reduce (or eliminate) their taxable income. [ 2006 Masterminds : Crazy Eddie Television Production History Television Canada ] They also paid employees off the books, and regularly skimmed thousands of dollars (in cash ) earned at the stores. For every $5 Crazy Eddie reported as income, $1 was taken by the Antars. In 1979, the Antars began depositing much of this money (hundreds of thousands of dollars) in Israeli bank accounts. The Antar family skimmed an estimated $3 million to $4 million (US) per year at the height of their fraud. In one offshore bank account, the family deposited more than $6 million between 1980 and 1983. By 1983, it was becoming more and more difficult to hide the millions of illicit dollars. The Antars decided that the way to cover up their growing fraud was to take the company public. In preparation, Eddie Antar initiated a scheme in 1979 to skim less each year. Since more income was actually being reported, this had the effect of showing drastically increasing profit margins. While the company&apos;s actual profits (taking into account skimmed profits) from 1980 to 1983 increased approximately 13%, reported profits rose nearly 171%. [ Crazy Eddie Fraud Summary http://www.whitecollarfraud.com/947660.html September 7, 2006 ] Despite the misgivings of people closely associated with Crazy Eddie, the company held its initial public offering on September 13, 1984 ( symbol : CRZY). Shares of the company sold initially for $8. By early 1986, Crazy Eddie stock was trading at more than $75 per share (split adjusted). Eddie recruited his cousin, Sam E. Antar (known as Sammy), to assist the company with its fraud. Sammy earned a degree in accounting in 1980, and served his apprenticeship with Penn and Horowitz, Crazy Eddie&apos;s auditor. In 1986, he was named CFO of the company. Sammy was informed that there was a $3 million deficit from the previous year&apos;s inventory fraud that needed to be hidden. Additionally, he was instructed to find ways to show a 10% growth in sales. One of Sammy&apos;s major schemes was a money laundering operation later known as the Panama Pump — money that the Antars had deposited in Israeli banks was transferred to bank accounts in Panama. These accounts, opened under false names, then drafted payments to Crazy Eddie. This money was largely used to inflate same-store sales figures for the company. As a public company, Eddie, Sammy, and others engaged in increasing amounts of inventory fraud to increase reported profits and inflate the value of Crazy Eddie stock. For the fiscal year ended March 1, 1985, Crazy Eddie falsified inventories by $3 million. The next fiscal year, that amount increased to between $10 and $12 million. [ Collapse ] Only months after Crazy Eddie&apos;s IPO, the once tight-knit Antar family began to crack. Eddie Antar started fighting with his wife and former high school sweetheart, Debbie. He began having an affair with another woman named Debbie. They were caught by Eddie&apos;s wife and sister on New Year&apos;s Eve 1984. Crazy Eddie&apos;s troubles began almost immediately afterward; the scam had relied extensively on family members helping keep up the appearance that it was an immensely successful company. By 1987, Sammy&apos;s goal was no longer to show higher profitability, but rather to cover up previous frauds. In fiscal year 1987, they falsified inventories between $22.5 and $28 million. In addition, Crazy Eddie booked $20 million in phony debit memos or charge backs to vendors that reduced accounts payable. As the company&apos;s fraud became harder to cover up, the public perception of Crazy Eddie as a commercial success began to change. By October 1986, the company&apos;s stock value had dropped to $17.50 per share. In December, Eddie Antar announced his resignation as president and CEO. In April 1987, it was announced that Eddie had in fact retained his role as president but had fired, among others, his father Sam M. Antar. But by then Eddie had already cashed out his share of Crazy Eddie stock, worth between $25 million and $30 million. By the spring of 1987, the company&apos;s stock had plummeted below $10 a share. Additionally, earnings fell 20 percent from the previous year. The franchise did show a 34 percent sales increase, but this was mainly the result of 13 new store openings. In May 1987, Eddie began proceedings to take the company private again. [ The Story Behind the Story of Crazy Eddie http://www.whitecollarfraud.com/1267804.html September 7, 2006 ] Before that could happen, Houston -based businessman Elias Zinn and management consultant Victor Palmieri initiated a hostile takeover. With Palmieri&apos;s backing, Zinn purchased $17.5 million worth of Crazy Eddie stock, which represented 7½ percent of the outstanding shares. Once rumors of a takeover started, financial analysts began to more closely examine Crazy Eddie&apos;s financial situation. What they discovered was that while most stockholders in the company had lost money since 1984, Eddie Antar had sold 6.5 million shares worth $74 million. A flurry of stockholder lawsuits were filed against the Antar family. Eddie and Sammy briefly attempted to counter-offer Zinn&apos;s takeover, but Zinn quickly topped their funds. The Antars&apos; bid was dropped, and Zinn became the new owner of Crazy Eddie on November 6, 1987. He immediately removed the rest of the Antar family from any positions of power. When Palmieri&apos;s financial analysts completed their preliminary audit, a few weeks after the takeover, they estimated that Crazy Eddie&apos;s inventory was short by $40 to $50 million. The final figure was $80 million. [ Legal battles ] In the meantime, a longtime Crazy Eddie associate named Arnie Spindler, who left the company after Eddie Antar engineered the firing of his father Sam, brothers Allen and Mitchell and others after a family rift, had provided investigators with information concerning Crazy Eddie&apos;s fraudulent business practices. Spindler implicated Eddie and Sammy, but stated the rest of the family was clean. Regardless, the SEC served subpoena s to the entire Antar family. By June 1988, Crazy Eddie&apos;s suppliers were demanding the liquidation of the company, so they could recover money owed to them. In 1989 they would get their wish. The closing of Crazy Eddie began in March 1989, as the company shuttered 17 of its 43 stores. On June 6, 1989 Crazy Eddie was served with a petition by five of its creditors, who had not been paid a total of $860,000 they were owed, which sought to have the company forced into bankruptcy. The company originally planned to fight the petition and file for dismissal, but fifteen days later Crazy Eddie voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. [ Crazy Eddie In Chapter 11 http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res%3DFA0715F93D550C728EDDAF0894D1484D81 September 7, 2006 The New York Times June 21, 1989 ] Company president and CEO Peter Martosella cited problems created by the creditors&apos; position (which he termed &quot; ill-advised &quot; ), but said business would be conducted as usual at the remaining 26 stores and that Crazy Eddie was still a strong franchise. The company vowed to stay in business but despite Martosella&apos;s assertions Crazy Eddie continued to falter. By the fall of 1989, sales were continuing to fall and stores were unable to keep items stocked due to lack of supplier interest in the company. Faced with these facts, Crazy Eddie management decided that the chain was not worth saving. Soon after Crazy Eddie began going-out-of-business sales, but store supply remained minimal even when leftover merchandise from stores that had shuttered was sent to others that were still in operation. By the end of the year the remaining 26 Crazy Eddie locations closed and the chain ceased to exist. [ http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n2_v29/ai_8530069/ He&apos;s baaack!

Based on information gathered over the course of its investigation, the SEC charged Eddie Antar with securities fraud and illegal insider trading on September 6, 1989. [ S.E.C.

He was also ordered to appear in court to explain what had happened with the money. When he failed to appear, an arrest warrant was issued. Eddie surrendered to U.S. Marshals a week later, but was released and ordered to appear at a second hearing. When he failed to appear at that hearing, a second arrest warrant was issued and his assets were frozen.

After Eddie left the country, Sammy offered to testify for Federal prosecutors in exchange for immunity. Sammy pleaded guilty to three felonies. However, he avoided jail time for his testimony, and was instead sentenced to six months of house arrest, 1,200 hours of community service, three years of probation, and was given more than $10,000 in fines. [ Criminal and Civil Cases http://www.whitecollarfraud.com/1327808.html September 7, 2006 ] As of 2009, Sammy was an advisor for government agencies and businesses investigating fraud.

While being held in Israel, Eddie was charged with Federal racketeering conspiracy. He was extradited to the United States in January 1993, and pled not guilty to the charges brought against him. Eddie Antar&apos;s fraud trial began in June, and was prosecuted jointly by U.S. Attorneys Paul Weissman and Michael Chertoff. On July 20, 1993, Eddie Antar was found guilty on 17 counts of fraud. His brother, Mitchell, was found guilty on three counts, and acquitted on two. In April 1994, Eddie Antar was sentenced to 12½ years in prison for racketeering and stock fraud. Antar&apos;s lawyers immediately filed an appeal, citing what they believed was bias on the part of the presiding judge. In April 1995, the verdicts against Eddie and Mitchell were overturned by a Federal appeals panel. Chertoff, calling Eddie &quot; the Darth Vader of capitalism, &quot; vowed to begin a new trial. Antar eventually pled guilty to Federal fraud charges in May 1996. In February 1997, he was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was ordered to pay more than $150 million in fines, in addition to the more than $1 billion in judgments against him, stemming from various civil suits. Efforts to recover additional money from the Antar family on behalf of defrauded stockholders continue to this day. [ Revival attempts ] Shortly after the chain closed in 1989 a New Jersey-based investment group led by Alex Adjimi bought the rights to the Crazy Eddie trademark and announced in January 1990 that they had purchased the leases on Crazy Eddie&apos;s Brooklyn flagship store and another in East Brunswick, New Jersey. The intent of Adjimi&apos;s group was to reopen the chain, but nothing ever came of the attempt.

Despite plans to expand the chain to a potential ten stores, the new Crazy Eddie did not expand beyond the Wayne store and in 1999 the only store in the revived chain closed.
