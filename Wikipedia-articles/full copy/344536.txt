Tens of millions of individuals worldwide are estimated tobecome infected with Hep A each year. [ 10.1093/epirev/mxj012 Wasley A, Fiore A, Bell BP Hepatitis A in the era of vaccination Epidemiol Rev 28 101–11 2006 16775039 ] The time between infection and the appearance of the symptoms (the incubation period ) is between two and six weeks and the average incubation period is 28 days.

As incomes rise and access to clean water increases, the incidence of HAV decreases.

In Europe, the United States and other industrialized countries, on the other hand, the infection is contracted primarily by susceptible young adults, most of whom are infected with the virus during trips to countries with a high incidence of the disease or through contact with infectious persons. HAV infection produces a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection or chronic liver disease. However, 10–15% of patients might experience a relapse of symptoms during the 6 months after acute illness. Acute liver failure from Hepatitis A is rare (overall case-fatality rate: 0.5%). The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with &gt; 80% of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infection.

Clinical course and consequences of hepatitis A infection Vaccine 18 71–4 2000 10683554 ] Antibody produced in response to HAV infection persists for life and confers protection against reinfection. The disease can be prevented by vaccination, and hepatitis A vaccine has been proven effective in controlling outbreaks worldwide. [ Signs and symptoms ] Early symptoms of hepatitis A infection can be mistaken for influenza, but some sufferers, especially children, exhibit no symptoms at all. Symptoms typically appear 2 to 6 weeks, (the incubation period ), after the initial infection. [ Hepatitis A Symptoms eMedicineHealth http://www.emedicinehealth.com/hepatitis_a/page3_em.htm#Hepatitis%20A%20Symptoms 2007-05-17 2007-05-18 ] Symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although some people can be ill for as long as 6 months.: [ Hepatitis A Information for the Public Center for Disease Control http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/A/aFAQ.htm 2009-09-17 2011-01-08 ] Fatigue Fever Abdominal pain Nausea Appetite loss Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes Bile is removed from blood stream and excreted in urine, giving it a dark amber colour Clay-coloured feces [ Virology ] [ Hepatitis A Hepatitis A virus 02.jpg Electron micrograph of hepatitis A virions. 185px iv Picornaviridae Hepatovirus Hepatitis A virus ] Following ingestion, HAV enters the bloodstream through the epithelium of the oropharynx or intestine. { Murray, P. R., Rosenthal, K. S. &amp; Pfaller, M. A. (2005) Medical Microbiology 5th ed., Elsevier Mosby. } The blood carries the virus to its target, the liver, where it multiplies within hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (liver macrophages). Virions are secreted into the bile and released in stool. HAV is excreted in large quantities approximately 11 days prior to appearance of symptoms or anti-HAV IgM antibodies in the blood. The incubation period is 15–50 days and mortality is less than 0.5%.Within the liver hepatocytes the RNA genome is released from the protein coat and is translated by the cell&apos;s own ribosomes. Unlike other members of the Picornaviruses this virus requires an intact eukaryote initiating factor 4G (eIF4G) for the initiation of translation. [ Aragonès L, Guix S, Ribes E, Bosch A, Pintó RM Fine-tuning translation kinetics selection as the driving force of codon usage bias in the hepatitis A virus capsid PLoS Pathog. 6 3 e1000797 2010 March 20221432 2832697 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000797 http://www.plospathogens.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000797%26amp%3Brepresentation%3DPDF ] The requirement for this factor results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis unlike other picornaviruses. The virus must then inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery which may explain its poor growth in cell culture. Presumably for this reason the virus has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host. Precisely how this strategy works is not quite clear yet. There is no apparent virus-mediated cytotoxicity presumably because of the virus&apos; own requirement for an intact eIF4G and liver pathology is likely immune-mediated. [ Structure ] The Hepatitis virus (HAV) is a Picornavirus; it is non-enveloped and contains a single-stranded RNA packaged in a protein shell. [ Cristina J, Costa-Mattioli M Genetic variability and molecular evolution of hepatitis A virus Virus Res. 127 2 151–7 2007 August 17328982 10.1016/j.virusres.2007.01.005 ] There is only one serotype of the virus, but multiple genotypes exist. [ Costa-Mattioli M, Di Napoli A, Ferré V, Billaudel S, Perez-Bercoff R, Cristina J Genetic variability of hepatitis A virus J. Gen. Virol. 84 Pt 12 3191–201 2003 December 14645901 10.1099/vir.0.19532-0 ] Codon use within the genome is biased and unusually distinct from its host. It also has a poor internal ribosome entry site [ Whetter LE, Day SP, Elroy-Stein O, Brown EA, Lemon SM Low efficiency of the 5&apos; nontranslated region of hepatitis A virus RNA in directing cap-independent translation in permissive monkey kidney cells J. Virol. 68 8 5253–63 1994 August 8035522 236470 ] In the region that codes for the HAV capsid there are highly conserved clusters of rare codons that restrict antigenic variability.

Virol. 82 4 1688–700 2008 February 18057242 2258700 10.1128/JVI.01842-07 ] [ Transmission ] The virus spreads by the fecal-oral route and infections often occur in conditions of poor sanitation and overcrowding. Hepatitis A can be transmitted by the parenteral route but very rarely by blood and blood products. Food-borne outbreaks are not uncommon, [ Brundage SC, Fitzpatrick AN Hepatitis A Am Fam Physician 73 12 2162–8 2006 16848078 ] and ingestion of shellfish cultivated in polluted water is associated with a high risk of infection. [ Lees D Viruses and bivalve shellfish Int. J. Food Microbiol. 59 1–2 81–116 2000 10946842 10.1016/S0168-1605(00)00248-8 ] Approximately 40% of all acute viral hepatitis is caused by HAV. Infected individuals are infectious prior to onset of symptoms, roughly 10 days following infection. The virus is resistant to detergent, acid (pH 1), solvents (e.g., ether, chloroform ), drying, and temperatures up to 60  °C. It can survive for months in fresh and salt water. Common-source (e.g., water, restaurant) outbreaks are typical. Infection is common in children in developing countries, reaching 100% incidence, but following infection there is life-long immunity. HAV can be inactivated by: chlorine treatment (drinking water), formalin (0.35%, 37  °C, 72 hours), peracetic acid (2%, 4 hours), beta-propiolactone (0.25%, 1 hour), and UV radiation (2 μW/cm 2 /min). [ Diagnosis ] Serum IgG, IgM and ALT following Hepatitis A virus infection Although HAV is excreted in the feces towards the end of the incubation period, specific diagnosis is made by the detection of HAV-specific IgM antibodies in the blood. [ Stapleton JT Host immune response to hepatitis A virus J. Infect. Dis. 171 Suppl 1 S9–14 1995 7876654 ] IgM antibody is only present in the blood following an acute hepatitis A infection. It is detectable from one to two weeks after the initial infection and persists for up to 14 weeks. The presence of IgG antibody in the blood means that the acute stage of the illness is past and the person is immune to further infection. IgG antibody to HAV is also found in the blood following vaccination and tests for immunity to the virus are based on the detection of this antibody. During the acute stage of the infection, the liver enzyme alanine transferase (ALT) is present in the blood at levels much higher than is normal. The enzyme comes from the liver cells that have been damaged by the virus. [ Musana KA, Yale SH, Abdulkarim AS Tests of Liver Injury Clin Med Res 2 2 129–31 2004 15931347 10.3121/cmr.2.2.129 1069083 ] Hepatitis A virus is present in the blood, ( viremia ), and feces of infected people up to two weeks before clinical illness develops. [ Prevention ] [ information about the vaccine, its properties, and its application Hepatitis A vaccine ] Hepatitis A can be prevented by vaccination, good hygiene and sanitation. { http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Hepatitis-A/Pages/Prevention.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx } The vaccine protects against HAV in more than 95% of cases for longer than 20 years. It contains inactivated hepatitis A virus providing active immunity against a future infection.

[ Hepatitis A Vaccine: What you need to know Vaccine Information Statement CDC http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-hep-a.pdf 2006-03-21 2007-03-12 ] The vaccine is given by injection. An initial dose provides protection starting two to four weeks after vaccination; the second booster dose, given six to twelve months later, provides protection for over twenty years. [ Vaccination programmes ] The vaccine was introduced in 1992 and was initially recommended for persons at high risk. Since then Bahrain and Israel have embarked on eradication programmes. { André FE (2006) Universal mass vaccination against hepatitis A. Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 304:95-114 } Australia, China, Byelorussia, Italy, Spain and the United States have started similar programmes. The incidence of Hepatitis A where widespread vaccination has been practised has decreased dramatically. In China and the United States the incidence of Hepatitis A has decreased by 90% since 1990. { Cui F, Hadler SC, Zheng H, Wang F, Zhenhua W, Yuansheng H, Gong X, Chen Y, Liang X (2009) Hepatitis A surveillance and vaccine use in China from 1990 through 2007.

Sufferers are advised to rest, avoid fatty foods and alcohol (these may be poorly tolerated for some additional months during the recovery phase and cause minor relapses), eat a well-balanced diet, and stay hydrated. { Hepatitis A PubMed Health } [ Prognosis ] The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1991 reported a low mortality rate for hepatitis A of 4 deaths per 1000 cases for the general population but a higher rate of 17.5 per 1000 in those aged 50 and over. The risk of death from acute liver failure following HAV infection increases with age and when the person has underlying chronic liver disease. Young children who are infected with hepatitis A typically have a milder form of the disease, usually lasting from 1–3 weeks, whereas adults tend to experience a much more severe form of the disease.

High-income regions (Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) have very low HAV endemicity levels and a high proportion of susceptible adults, low-income regions (sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia) have high endemicity levels and almost no susceptible adolescents and adults, and most middle-income regions have a mix of intermediate and low endemicity levels. Anti-HAV prevalence suggest that middle-income regions in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East currently [ May 2012 ] have an intermediate or low level of endemicity. The countries in these regions may have an increasing burden of disease from hepatitis A.

The agency estimates that there were as many as 270,000 cases each year from 1980 through 2000. { Index | CDC Viral Hepatitis } [ Genotypes ] Only one serotype and seven different genetic groups (four humans and three simian) have been described. { Cristina J, Costa-Mattioli M (2007) Genetic variability and molecular evolution of hepatitis A virus. Virus Res 127(2):151-157 } The human genotypes are numbered I-III. Six subtypes have been described (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB). The simian genotypes have been numbered IV-VI.
