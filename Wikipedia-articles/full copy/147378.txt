[ The Irish Times: A History Mark O&apos;Brien Four Courts Press 2008 978-1-84682-123-3 ] Today it is no longer considered a Unionist paper; it is generally perceived as being politically liberal and progressive, as well as being right-wing on economic issues. { McCabe,Conor, Sins of the Father: Tracing the Decisions That Shaped the Irish Economy (Dublin, 2011), p. 179. } The paper&apos;s most prominent columnists include writer and arts commentator Fintan O&apos;Toole and the satirist Miriam Lord. Former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald was also a columnist. Senior international figures, including Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and others have written for its op-ed page. Its most prominent columns have included Drapier (an anonymous column produced weekly by a politician, giving the &apos;insider&apos; view of politics); Rite and Reason, a weekly religious column, edited by Patsy McGarry, Religious Affairs Editor; and the long-running &quot; An Irishman&apos;s Diary &quot;, previously penned by Patrick Campbell in the forties (under the pseudonym &apos;Quidnunc&apos;), Seamus Kelly from 1949-1979 (also writing as &apos;Quidnunc&apos;), and more recently by Kevin Myers. Since the latter&apos;s move to the rival Irish Independent, &quot; An Irishman&apos;s Diary &quot; is now usually the work of Frank McNally. On the sports pages, Philip Reid is the paper&apos;s golf correspondent. One of its most famous columns was the biting and humorous Cruiskeen Lawn satire column written by Myles na gCopaleen, the pen name of Brian O&apos;Nolan (Brian Ó Nualláin) who also wrote books using the name Flann O&apos;Brien. Cruiskeen Lawn is an anglicised spelling of the Irish words cruiscín lán, meaning &apos;the full little jug&apos;. Cruiskeen Lawn made its debut in October 1940 and appeared with varying regularity until O&apos;Nolan&apos;s death in 1966. The Irish Times has the most foreign bureaux of any Irish newspaper. [ February 2008 ] It has had full-time correspondents in Washington, Paris, Berlin, Beijing, Brussels, London, Africa and other parts of the world. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, it had a daily circulation of 100,951 during the first six months of 2011.

The title was revived as a thrice weekly publication by Major Lawrence E. Knox, with the first edition being published on 29 March 1859. It was originally founded as a moderate Protestant Nationalist newspaper, reflecting the politics of Knox, who stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for Isaac Butt &apos;s Home Rule League. Its headquarters were at 4 Lower Abbey Street in Dublin. In its early days, its main competitor was the Dublin Daily Express. [ The Arnotts ] After Knox&apos;s death in 1873 the paper was sold to the widow of Sir John Arnott, MP, a former Lord Mayor of Cork and owner of Arnotts, one of Dublin &apos;s major Department store s. The sale, for £35000, led to two major changes. Its headquarters was shifted to 31 Westmoreland Street and it remained in buildings on or near that site until 2005. Its politics also shifted dramatically, becoming predominantly Protestant and Unionist. The paper along with the Irish Independent and various regional papers called for the execution of the leaders of the failed 1916 Easter Rising. [ http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/newspapers/na04.shtml Sir John Maxwell&apos;s Position The Irish Times 10 May 1916 BBC ] Though the paper became a publicly listed company in 1900, the family continued to hold a majority shareholding until the 1960s (even after the family lost control, the great-grandson of the original purchaser was the paper&apos;s London editor). The last member of the Arnott family to sit on the paper&apos;s board was Sir Lauriston Arnott, who died in 1958. The editor during the 1930s, R. M. Smyllie, had strong anti-fascist views: he angered the Irish Catholic hierarchy by opposing General Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Later the Irish Times like other national newspapers had problems with Irish Government censorship during World War II. The Times was largely pro-Allied and was opposed to the Éamon de Valera government&apos;s policy of neutrality. [ Irish Media: A Critical History Since 1922 John Horgan John Horgan (academic) Routledge 2001 38–45 ] [ The Irish Times Trust ] In 1974, ownership was transferred to a charitable trust, The Irish Times Trust. The former owner, Major Thomas McDowell, was made &quot; president for life &quot; of the trust which runs the paper and was paid a large dividend.

[ Recent history ] In 1969, the longest-serving editor of The Irish Times, Douglas Gageby, was called a &quot; white nigger &quot; by the company chairman (a former British army officer), because of the newspaper&apos;s coverage of Northern Ireland at the outset of the Troubles, which was upsetting the British government.

None of the journalist s were laid off, but many took a voluntary redundancy package when the paper was greatly restructured. Some foreign bureaux were closed and it also stopped publishing &apos;colour&apos; pages devoted to local Irish regions, with regional coverage now merged with news. The paper&apos;s problems stemmed partly from internal strife which led to Major McDowells&apos;s daughter, Karen Erwin, not being made Chief Executive. The reorganisation had the desired effect; after posting losses of almost €3 million in 2002, the paper returned to profit in 2003. John Waters, the only columnist to speak out about the perceived vast salaries of the editor, managing director and deputy editor, was sacked and re-hired a week later, in November 2003.

Later, columnist Fintan O&apos;Toole told the Sunday Independent : &quot; We as a paper are not shy of preaching about corporate pay and fat cats but with this there is a sense of excess. Some of the sums mentioned are disturbing. This is not an attack on Ms. Kennedy, it is an attack on the executive level of pay. There is double-standard of seeking more job cuts while paying these vast salaries.
