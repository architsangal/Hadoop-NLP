Also known as Diogenes of Sinope ( [ Διογένης ὁ Σινωπεύς ], Diogenēs ho Sinōpeus), he was born in Sinope (modern-day Sinop, Turkey ), an Ionian colony on the Black Sea, { Diogenes of Sinope } [ http://www.beyond-the-pale.co.uk/diogenes.htm Voice in the Wilderness 2011-11-13 ] in 412 or 404 BCE and died at Corinth in 323 BCE.

The } { Suda puts his birth at the time of the } { Thirty Tyrants, which also gives 404 BCE. } Diogenes of Sinope was a controversial figure. His father minted coins for a living and when Diogenes took to &quot; defacement of the currency &quot;, he was banished from the city. After being exiled, he moved to Athens to debunk cultural conventions. Diogenes modelled himself on the example of Hercules. He believed that virtue was better revealed in action than in theory. He used his lifestyle and behaviour to criticise the social values and institutions of what he saw as a corrupt society. He declared himself a cosmopolitan. There are many tales about him dogging Antisthenes &apos; footsteps and becoming his faithful hound, { Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 6, 18, 21; Dio Chrysostom, Orations, viii. 1–4; Aelian, x. 16; Stobaeus, Florilegium, 13.19 } but it is by no means certain that the two men ever met. Diogenes made a virtue of poverty. He begged for a living and slept in a tub in the marketplace. He became notorious for his philosophical stunts such as carrying a lamp in the daytime, claiming to be looking for an honest man. He publicly mocked Alexander and lived. He embarrassed Plato, disputed his interpretation of Socrates and sabotaged his lectures. After being captured by pirates and sold into slavery, Diogenes eventually settled in Corinth. There he passed his philosophy of Cynicism to Crates, who taught it to Zeno of Citium, who fashioned it into the school of Stoicism, one of the most enduring schools of Greek philosophy. None of Diogenes’ many writings have survived, but details of his life come in the form of anecdotes ( chreia ), especially from Diogenes Laërtius, in his book Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. All we have is a number of anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources, none of them definitive. { Diogenes of Sinope } [ http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_diogenes.html The Basics of Philosophy ] { Retrieved November 13, 2011. } [ Life ] Diogenes was born in the Greek colony of Sinope on the south coast of the Black Sea, either in 412 BCE or 404 BCE. Nothing is known about his early life except that his father Hicesias was a banker. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:20 ] {. A trapezites was a banker/money-changer who could exchange currency, arrange loans, and was sometimes entrusted with the minting of currency. } It seems likely that Diogenes was also enrolled into the banking business aiding his father. At some point (the exact date is unknown) Hicesias and Diogenes became embroiled in a scandal involving the adulteration or defacement of the currency, { Navia, Diogenes the Cynic, pg 226: &quot; The word paracharaxis can be understood in various ways such as the defacement of currency or the counterfeiting of coins or the adulteration of money. &quot; } and Diogenes was exiled from the city. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:20-21 ] This aspect of the story seems to be corroborated by archaeology: large numbers of defaced coins (smashed with a large chisel stamp) have been discovered at Sinope dating from the middle of the 4th century BCE, and other coins of the time bear the name of Hicesias as the official who minted them. { C. T. Seltman, Diogenes of Sinope, Son of the Banker Hikesias, in Transactions of the International Numismatic Congress 1936 (London 1938). } The reasons for the defacement of the coinage are unclear, although Sinope was being disputed between pro- Persian and pro- Greek factions in the 4th century, and there may have been political rather than financial motives behind the act. [ In Athens ] { Jean-Léon Gérôme (1860) } According to one story, Diogenes went to the Oracle at Delphi to ask for its advice and was told that he should &quot; deface the currency”. Following the debacle in Sinope Diogenes decided that the oracle meant that he should deface the political currency rather than actual coins. He traveled to Athens and made it his life&apos;s goal to challenge established customs and values. He argued that instead of being troubled about the true nature of evil, people merely rely on customary interpretations. This distinction between nature ( &quot; physis &quot; ) and custom ( &quot; nomos [ March 2012 ] &quot; ) is a favorite theme of ancient Greek philosophy, and one that Plato takes up in The Republic, in the legend of the Ring of Gyges. { Plato, Republic, 2.359-2.360. } Diogenes arrived in Athens with a slave named Manes who abandoned him shortly thereafter. With characteristic humour, Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying, &quot; If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes? &quot; [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:55 ] {; Seneca, De Tranquillitate Animi, 8.7.; Aelian, Varia Historia, 13.28. } Diogenes would mock such a relation of extreme dependency. He found the figure of a master who could do nothing for himself contemptibly helpless. He was attracted by the ascetic teaching of Antisthenes, a student of Socrates, who (according to Plato ) had been present at his death. { Plato, Phaedo, 59 b. } When Diogenes asked Antisthenes to mentor him, Antisthenes ignored him and reportedly &quot; eventually beat him off with his staff &quot;. Diogenes responds, &quot; Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from you, so long as I think you&apos;ve something to say. &quot; Diogenes became Antisthenes&apos; pupil, despite the brutality with which he was initially received. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:21 ] {; Aelian, Varia Historia, 10.16.; Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum, 2.14. } Whether the two ever really met is still uncertain, [ Long 1996 45 ] [ Dudley 1937 2 ] [ Prince 2005 77 ] but he surpassed his master both in reputation and in the austerity of his life. He considered his avoidance of earthly pleasures a contrast to and commentary on contemporary Athenian behaviors. This attitude was grounded in a disdain for what he regarded as the folly, pretense, vanity, self-deception and artificiality of human conduct. { J. H. W. Tischbein (c. 1780) } The stories told of Diogenes illustrate the logical consistency of his character. He inured himself to the weather by living in a tub belonging to the temple of Cybele. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:23 ] {; Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum, 2.14. } He destroyed the single wooden bowl he possessed on seeing a peasant boy drink from the hollow of his hands. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:37 ] {; Seneca, Epistles, 90.14.; Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum, 2.14. } It was contrary to Athenian customs to eat within the marketplace, and still he would eat, for, as he explained when rebuked, it was during the time he was in the marketplace that he felt hungry. He used to stroll about in full daylight with a lamp; when asked what he was doing, he would answer, &quot; I am just looking for an honest man. &quot; [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:41 ] {. Modern sources often say that Diogenes was looking for an &quot; honest man &quot;, but in ancient sources he is simply looking for a &quot; human &quot; (anthrôpos). The unreasoning behavior of the people around him means that they do not qualify as human. } Diogenes looked for a human being but reputedly found nothing but rascals and scoundrels. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:32 ] When Plato gave Socrates&apos; definition of man as &quot; featherless bipeds &quot; and was much praised for the definition, Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato&apos;s Academy, saying, &quot; Behold! I&apos;ve brought you a man. &quot; After this incident, &quot; with broad flat nails &quot; was added to Plato&apos;s definition. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:40 ] [ In Corinth ] According to a story which seems to have originated with Menippus of Gadara, [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:29 ] Diogenes was captured by pirate s while on voyage to Aegina and sold as a slave in Crete to a Corinth ian named Xeniades. Being asked his trade, he replied that he knew no trade but that of governing men, and that he wished to be sold to a man who needed a master. As tutor to Xeniades&apos; two sons, [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:30-31 ] it is said that he lived in Corinth for the rest of his life, which he devoted to preaching the doctrines of virtuous self-control. There are many stories about what actually happened to him after his time with Xeniades&apos; two sons. There are stories stating he was set free after he became &quot; a cherished member of the household &quot;, while one says he was set free almost immediately, and still another states that &quot; he grew old and died at Xeniades’ house in Corinth. &quot; [ www.iep.utm.edu/diogsino Diogenes of Sinope Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2006-04-26 Retrieved 2011-11-13 ] He is even said to have lectured to large audiences at the Isthmian Games. { Dio Chrysostom, Or.  8.10 } Although most of the stories about him living in a tub are located in Athens, there are some accounts of him living in a tub near the Craneum gymnasium in Corinth: A report that Philip was marching on the town had thrown all Corinth into a bustle; one was furbishing his arms, another wheeling stones, a third patching the wall, a fourth strengthening a battlement, every one making himself useful somehow or other. Diogenes having nothing to do – of course no one thought of giving him a job – was moved by the sight to gather up his philosopher&apos;s cloak and begin rolling his tub energetically up and down the Craneum; an acquaintance asked for, and got, the explanation: &quot; I do not want to be thought the only idler in such a busy multitude; I am rolling my tub to be like the rest. &quot; { Lucian, Historia, 3. } [ Diogenes and Alexander ] { Alexander the Great visits Diogenes at Corinth by W. Matthews (1914) } [ Diogenes and Alexander ] It was in Corinth that a meeting between Alexander the Great and Diogenes is supposed to have taken place. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:38 ] {; Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones, 5.32.; Plutarch, Alexander, 14, On Exile, 15; Dio Chrysostom, Or.  4.14 } The accounts of Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius recount that they exchanged only a few words: while Diogenes was relaxing in the sunlight in the morning, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, &quot; Yes, stand out of my sunlight &quot;. Alexander then declared, &quot; If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes. &quot; [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:32 ] {; Plutarch, Alexander, 14, On Exile, 15. } In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, &quot; I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave. &quot; { This story appears frequently in books from the 16th to the 19th century, and may be an example of an anecdote invented about Diogenes in modern times. } [ July 2010 ] { There is a similar anecdote in one of the dialogues of } { Lucian ( &apos;&apos;Menippus&apos;&apos;, 15) but that story concerns } { Menippus in the } { underworld. } [ Death ] There are conflicting accounts of Diogenes&apos; death. He is alleged variously to have held his breath; to have become ill from eating raw octopus; [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:76 ] {; Athenaeus, 8.341. } or to have suffered an infected dog bite. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:77 ] When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, &quot; Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away! &quot; When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied &quot; If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead? &quot; { Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones, 1.42. } At the end, Diogenes made fun of people&apos;s excessive concern with the &quot; proper &quot; treatment of the dead. The Corinthians erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of Parian marble. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:78 ] {; Greek Anthology, 1.285.; Pausanias, 2.2.4. } [ Philosophy ] [ Cynicism ] Along with Antisthenes and Crates of Thebes, Diogenes is considered one of the founders of Cynicism. The ideas of Diogenes, like those of most other Cynics, must be arrived at indirectly. No writings of Diogenes survived even though he is reported to have authored over ten books, a volume of letters and seven tragedies. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:80 ] Cynic ideas are inseparable from Cynic practice; therefore what we know about Diogenes is contained in anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources. { Jules Bastien-Lepage (1873) } Diogenes maintained that all the artificial growths of society were incompatible with happiness and that morality implies a return to the simplicity of nature. So great was his austerity and simplicity that the Stoics would later claim him to be a wise man or &quot; sophos &quot;. In his words, &quot; Humans have complicated every simple gift of the gods. &quot; [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:44 ] Although Socrates had previously identified himself as belonging to the world, rather than a city, { Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones, 5.37.; Plutarch, On Exile, 5.; Epictetus, Discourses, i.9.1. } Diogenes is credited with the first known use of the word &quot; cosmopolitan &quot;. When he was asked where he came from, he replied, &quot; I am a citizen of the world (cosmopolites) &quot;. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:63 ] {. Compare: } [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:72 ] {, Dio Chrysostom, Or.  4.13, Epictetus, Discourses, iii.24.66. } This was a radical claim in a world where a man&apos;s identity was intimately tied to his citizenship in a particular city state. An exile and an outcast, a man with no social identity, Diogenes made a mark on his contemporaries. Diogenes had nothing but disdain for Plato and his abstract philosophy. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:24 ] Diogenes viewed Antisthenes as the true heir to Socrates, and shared his love of virtue and indifference to wealth, { Plato, &apos;&apos;Apology&apos;&apos;, 41e. } together with a disdain for general opinion. { Xenophon, &apos;&apos;Apology&apos;&apos;, 1. } Diogenes shared Socrates&apos; belief that he could function as doctor to men&apos;s souls and improve them morally, while at the same time holding contempt for their obtuseness. Plato once described Diogenes as &quot; a Socrates gone mad. &quot; [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:54 ] {; Aelian, Varia Historia, 14.33. } [ Obscenity ] Diogenes taught by living example. He tried to demonstrate that wisdom and happiness belong to the man who is independent of society and that civilization is regressive. He scorned not only family and political social organization, but also property rights and reputation. He even rejected normal ideas about human decency. Diogenes is said to have eaten in the marketplace, [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:58,69 ] {. Eating in public places was considered bad manners. } urinated on some people who insulted him, [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:46 ] defecated in the theatre, { Dio Chrysostom, Or.  8.36; Julian, Orations, 6.202c. } masturbated in public, and pointed at people with his middle finger. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:34-35 ] {; Epictetus, Discourses, iii.2.11. Pointing with one&apos;s middle finger was considered insulting; with the finger pointing up instead of to another person, the } { finger gesture is considered obscene in modern times. } From &quot; Life of Diogenes &quot; : &quot; Someone took him [Diogenes] into a magnificent house and warned him not to spit, whereupon, having cleared his throat, he spat into the man&apos;s face, being unable, he said, to find a meaner receptacle. &quot; [ Diogenes the Dog ] Many anecdotes of Diogenes refer to his dog-like behavior, and his praise of a dog&apos;s virtues. It is not known whether Diogenes was insulted with the epithet &quot; doggish &quot; and made a virtue of it, or whether he first took up the dog theme himself. Diogenes believed human beings live artificially and hypocritically and would do well to study the dog. Besides performing natural bodily functions in public with ease, a dog will eat anything, and make no fuss about where to sleep. Dogs live in the present without anxiety, and have no use for the pretensions of abstract philosophy. In addition to these virtues, dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe. Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Diogenes stated that &quot; other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them. &quot; { Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, Florilegium, iii. 13. 44. } Statue of Diogenes at Sinop, Turkey The term &quot; Cynic &quot; itself derives from the Greek word κυνικός, kynikos, &quot; dog-like &quot; and that from κύων, kyôn, &quot; dog &quot; ( genitive : kynos). { &apos;&apos;&apos;Kynikos&apos;&apos;&apos;, &quot; A Greek-English Lexicon &quot;, Liddell and Scott, at Perseus } One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called dogs was because Antisthenes taught in the Cynosarges gymnasium at Athens. [ Laërtius Hicks 1925 Ⅵ:13 ] {. Cf. } { The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature, 2nd edition, p. 165. } The word Cynosarges means the place of the white dog. Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage, as a later commentator explained: There are four reasons why the Cynics are so named. First because of the indifference of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second reason is that the dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them. { Scholium on Aristotle&apos;s Rhetoric, quoted in } [ Dudley 1937 5 ] As noted (see Death), Diogenes&apos; association with dogs was memorialized by the Corinthians, who erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of Parian marble. [ Contemporary theory ] Diogenes is discussed in a 1983 book by German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk (English language publication in 1987). In his Critique of Cynical Reason, Diogenes is used as an example of Sloterdijk’s idea of the “kynical” — in which personal degradation is used for purposes of community comment or censure. Calling the practice of this tactic “kynismos,” Sloterdijk explains that the kynical actor actually embodies the message he/she is trying to convey. The goal here is typically a false regression that mocks authority — especially authority that the kynical actor considers corrupt, suspect or unworthy. There is another discussion of Diogenes and the Cynics in Michel Foucault &apos;s book Fearless Speech. Here Foucault discusses Diogenes&apos; antics in relation to the speaking of truth ( parrhesia ) in the ancient world. Foucault expands this reading in his last course at the Collège de France, The Courage of Truth. In this course Foucault tries to establish an alternative conception of militancy and revolution through a reading of Diogenes and Cynicism. { See the 7 March lecture Michel Foucault, The Courage of the Truth Lectures at the Collège de France (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011) } [ Diogenes syndrome ] [ Diogenes syndrome ] Diogenes&apos; name has been applied to a behavioural disorder characterised by involuntary self-neglect and hoarding. The disorder afflicts the elderly and has no relation to Diogenes&apos; deliberate Herculean rejection of material comfort. { Navia, Diogenes the Cynic, pg 31 } [ Depictions ] [ Art ] { Caspar de Crayer (c. 1650) } Both in ancient and in modern times, Diogenes&apos; personality has appealed strongly to sculptors and to painters. Ancient busts exist in the museums of the Vatican, the Louvre, and the Capitol. The interview between Diogenes and Alexander is represented in an ancient marble bas-relief found in the Villa Albani. Among artists who have painted the famous encounter of Diogenes with Alexander there are works by de Crayer, de Vos, Assereto, Langetti, Sevin, Sebastiano Ricci, Gandolfi, Wink, Abildgaard, Monsiau, Martin, and Daumier. The famous story of Diogenes searching for an &quot; honest man &quot; has been depicted by Jordaens, van Everdingen, van der Werff, Pannini, and Corinth. Others who have painted him with his famous lantern include de Ribera, Castiglione, Petrini, Gérôme, Bastien-Lepage, and Waterhouse. The scene in which Diogenes discards his cup has been painted by Poussin, Rosa, and Martin; and the story of Diogenes begging from a statue has been depicted by Restout. In Raphael &apos;s fresco The School of Athens, a lone reclining figure in the foreground represents Diogenes. { Michelangelo and the Pope&apos;s Ceiling, by Ross King } Diogenes has also been the subject of sculptures, with famous bas-relief images by Puget and Pajou. [ Literature ] Diogenes is referred to in Anton Chekhov &apos;s story &quot; Ward No. 6 &quot;; William Blake &apos;s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell; François Rabelais &apos; Gargantua and Pantagruel; Goethe &apos;s poem Genialisch Treiben; as well as in the first sentence of Søren Kierkegaard &apos;s novelistic treatise Repetition. In Cervantes &apos; short story &quot; The Man of Glass &quot; ( &quot; El licenciado Vidriera &quot; ), part of the Novelas Ejemplares collection, the (anti-)hero unaccountably begins to channel Diogenes in a string of tart chreia i once he becomes convinced that he is made of glass. Diogenes gives his own life and opinions in Christoph Martin Wieland &apos;s novel Socrates Mainomenos (1770; English translation Socrates Out of His Senses, 1771). Diogenes is the primary model for the philosopher Didactylos in Terry Pratchett &apos;s Small Gods. He is mimicked by a beggar-spy in Jacqueline Carey &apos;s Kushiel&apos;s Scion and paid tribute to with a costume in a party by the main character in its sequel, Kushiel&apos;s Justice. The character Lucy Snowe in Charlotte Bronte &apos;s novel Villette is given the nickname Diogenes. Diogenes also features in Part Four of Elizabeth Smart &apos;s By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept. He is a figure in Seamus Heaney &apos;s The Haw Lantern. In Christopher Moore &apos;s Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ&apos;s Childhood Pal, one of Jesus &apos; apostles is a devotee of Diogenes, complete with his own pack of dogs which he refers to as his own disciples. His story opens the first chapter of Dolly Freed&apos;s 1978 book Possum Living. { &apos;&apos;Possum Living&apos;&apos; by Dolly Freed } The dog that Paul Dombey befriends in Charles Dickens &apos; Dombey and Son is called Diogenes.Alexander&apos;s meeting with Diogenes is portrayed in Valerio Manfredi &apos;s Alexander: The Ends of the Earth. { &apos;&apos;Alexander: The Ends of the Earth&apos;&apos; by Valerio Manfredi } The many allusions to dogs in Shakespeare’s Timon of Athens are references to the school of Cynicism that could be interpreted as suggesting a parallel between the misanthropic hermit, Timon, and Diogenes; but Shakespeare would have had access to Michel de Montaigne ’s essay, &quot; Of Democritus and Heraclitus &quot;, which emphasised their differences: Timon actively wishes men ill and shuns them as dangerous, whereas Diogenes esteems them so little that contact with them could not disturb him { Hugh Grady, “A Companion to Shakespeare’s Works”, Dutton. R &amp; Howard J., Blakewell Publishing, 2003, ISBN 0-631-22632-X, p.443-444. } &quot; Timonism &quot; is in fact often contrasted with &quot; Cynicism &quot; : &quot; Cynics saw what people could be and were angered by what they had become; Timonists felt humans were hopelessly stupid &amp; uncaring by nature and so saw no hope for change. &quot; { Paul Ollswang, &quot; Cynicism: A Series of Cartoons on a Philosophical Theme &quot;, January 1988, page B at official site; repr. in The Best Comics of the Decade 1980-1990 Vol. 1, Seattle, 1990, ISBN 1-56097-035-9, p. 23. } The philosopher&apos;s name was adopted by the fictional Diogenes Club, an organization that Sherlock Holmes &apos; brother Mycroft Holmes belongs to in the story &quot; The Greek Interpreter &quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is called such as its members are educated, yet untalkative and have a dislike of socialising, much like the philosopher himself. The group is the focus of a number of Holmes pastiche s by Kim Newman.
