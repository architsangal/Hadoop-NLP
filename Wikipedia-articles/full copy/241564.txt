It is an extremely sensitive contact explosive : small quantities explode with a gunpowder-like snap when touched even lightly, releasing a purple cloud of iodine vapor. NI 3 has a complex structural chemistry that is difficult to study because of the instability of the derivatives. [ Structure of NI 3 and its derivatives ] Nitrogen triiodide was first characterized by X-ray crystallography in 1990 when it was prepared by an ammonia-free route. Boron nitride reacts with iodine monofluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at −30 °C to produce pure NI 3 in low yield: [ Tornieporth-Oetting, I.; Klapötke, T. Nitrogen Triiodide Angewandte Chemie International Edition 1990 29 6 677–679 10.1002/anie.199006771 ] BN + 3IF → NI 3 + BF 3 NI 3 is pyramidal (C 3v molecular symmetry ), as are the other nitrogen trihalides as well as ammonia. [ Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. Inorganic Chemistry Academic Press San Diego 2001 0-12-352651-5 ] The material that is usually called &quot; nitrogen triiodide &quot; is prepared by the reaction of iodine with ammonia. When this reaction is conducted at low temperatures in anhydrous ammonia, the initial product is NI 3 · (NH 3 ) 5, but this material loses some ammonia upon warming to give the 1:1 adduct NI 3 · NH 3. This adduct was first reported by Bernard Courtois in 1812, and its formula was finally determined in 1905 by Oswald Silberrad. [ Silberrad, O. The Constitution of Nitrogen Triiodide Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions 1905 87 55–66 10.1039/CT9058700055 ] Its solid state structure consists of chains of -NI 2 -I-NI 2 -I-NI 2 -I-... Ammonia molecules are situated between the chains. When kept cold in the dark and damp with ammonia, NI 3 · NH 3 is stable. [ Decomposition and explosiveness ] The instability of NI 3 and NI 3 · NH 3 can be attributed to the great stability of N 2. [ the stability of N 2 is relevant to the difference in binding energy i.e. the power/explosiveness but is not relevant to the activition energy i.e. the reactant instability November 2011 ] Nitrogen triiodide has no practical commercial value due to its extreme shock sensitivity, making it impossible to store, transport, and utilize for controlled explosions. Whereas pure nitroglycerin is also highly shock-sensitive (although not nearly as much so as nitrogen triiodide, which can be set off with the touch of a feather) and powerful, it was only due to phlegmatizers that its shock sensitivity was reduced and it became safer to handle and transport as dynamite. The decomposition of NI 3 proceeds as follows to give nitrogen gas and iodine: 2 NI 3 (s) → N 2 (g) + 3 I 2 (g) (–290 kJ/mol) However, the dry material is a contact explosive, decomposing approximately as follows: 8 NI 3 · NH 3 → 5 N 2 + 6 NH 4 I + 9 I 2 Consistent with this equation, these explosions leave orange-to-purple stains of iodine, which can be removed with sodium thiosulfate solution. An alternate method of stain removal is to simply allow the iodine time to sublime.Small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesized as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of &quot; chemical magic &quot;. [ Ford, L. A.; Grundmeier, E. W. Chemical Magic Dover 1993 76 0-486-67628-5 ] To highlight the sensitivity of the compound, it is usually detonated by touching it with a feather but even the slightest air current or other movement can cause detonation. Nitrogen triiodide is also notable for being the only known chemical explosive that detonates when exposed to alpha particles and nuclear fission products. [ Bowden, F. P.
