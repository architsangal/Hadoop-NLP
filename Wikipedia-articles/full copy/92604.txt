[ 71 km mi ] { 176  million (2002) } { King&apos;s Cross St Pancras } { Cockfosters } { Northfields } The Piccadilly line is a line of the London Underground, coloured dark blue on the Tube map. It is the fifth busiest line on the Underground network on the basis of the number of passengers transported per year. It is mainly a deep-level line, running from the north to the west of London via Zone 1, with a number of surface sections, mostly in its westernmost parts. Out of the 53 stations served, 25 are underground. It is the second longest line on the system, after the Central Line. It serves many of London&apos;s top tourist attractions including Harrods, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus (after which the line is named), Leicester Square and Covent Garden, as well as London&apos;s biggest airport, Heathrow. [ History ] [ The beginnings ] See Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway for detailed histories of the Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway (GNP &amp; BR), the Great Northern &amp; Strand Railway (GN &amp; SR), and the Brompton &amp; Piccadilly Circus Railway (B &amp; PCR). The Piccadilly line began as the Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway (GNP &amp; BR), one of several railways controlled by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), whose chief director was Charles Tyson Yerkes, although he died before any of his schemes came to fruition. The GNP &amp; BR was formed from the merger of two earlier, but unbuilt, tube-railway companies taken over in 1901 by Yerkes&apos; consortium: the Great Northern &amp; Strand Railway (GN &amp; SR) and the Brompton &amp; Piccadilly Circus Railway (B &amp; PCR). The GN &amp; SR&apos;s and B &amp; PCR&apos;s separate routes were linked with an additional section between [ Piccadilly Circus ] and [ Holborn ]. A section of the Metropolitan District Railway &apos;s scheme for a deep-level tube line between [ South Kensington ] and [ Earl&apos;s Court ] was also added in order to complete the route. When the GNP &amp; BR was formally opened on 15 December 1906, the line ran from the Great Northern Railway&apos;s station at [ Finsbury Park ] to the District Railway&apos;s station at [ Hammersmith District ]. On 30 November 1907, the short branch from Holborn to the Strand (later renamed [ Aldwych ] ) opened, which had been planned as the last section of the GN &amp; SR before the amalgamation with the B &amp; PCR was made. In 1905 (and again in 1965), plans were made to extend it the short distance south under the River Thames to Waterloo, but this never happened. Although built with twin tunnels, single-line shuttle operation became the norm on the branch from 1918 on, with the eastern tunnel closed to traffic. [ Later changes ] On 1 July 1910, the GNP &amp; BR and the other UERL-owned tube railways (the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway ) were merged, by private Act of Parliament, [ 23 November 1909 28311 8816 8818 27 May 2008 ] { The merger was carried out by transferring the assets of the CCE &amp; HR and the BS &amp; WR to the GNP &amp; BR and renaming the GNP &amp; BR as the London Electric Railway. } to become the London Electric Railway Company. On 10 December 1928, a rebuilt Piccadilly Circus station was opened. This included a sub-surface booking hall and eleven escalators, replacing the original lifts, and was the start of a considerable renovation of the whole railway, which included a comprehensive programme of station enlargement, on the same basis as the improvements at Piccadilly Circus. [ Cockfosters extension ] { Ruislip Manor station. } [ Piccadilly line extension to Cockfosters ] From the 1920s onwards there had been severe congestion at the line&apos;s northern terminus, Finsbury Park, where travellers had to change on to trams and buses for destinations in North and North East London. There had been deputations made to Parliament, asking for an early extension of the line either towards Tottenham and Edmonton or towards Wood Green and Palmers Green. The early 1930s was a time of recession, and in order to relieve unemployment, government capital was made available. The chief features of the scheme were an extension northwards from Finsbury Park to [ Cockfosters ]. It was also planned to build a station between [ Manor House ] and [ Turnpike Lane ] at the junction of Green Lanes and St Ann&apos;s Road in Harringay, but this was stopped by Frank Pick, who felt that the bus and tram service at this point was adequate. However, a &apos;Ventilation station&apos;, in similar architectural style to tube stations of the time was provided at the site, and is visible today. There was also some opposition from the London and North Eastern Railway to the line. The extension began from Finsbury Park to a point a little south of [ Arnos Grove ]. The total length of the extension is [ 12 km on ] : it cost £4  million to build and was opened in sections as follows: 19 September 1932: to Arnos Grove 13 March 1933: to Enfield West (now Oakwood), in conjunction with the westward extension to Hounslow West 19 July 1933: completion to Cockfosters [ Westward extensions ] Powers to link with existing tracks west of Hammersmith were originally obtained in 1913. A Parliamentary report of 1919 recommended through running to Richmond and Ealing. By the end of the 1920s the priority had shifted to serving the areas around Hounslow and north and west of Ealing. The outcome involved taking over the inner pair of tracks between Hammersmith and Acton Town as a non-stop service, while the Metropolitan District Railway would continue to provide the stopping service on the outer pair of tracks. { Barker &amp; Robbins 1974, p. 252. } Construction of the linking sections started in 1930, and the services opened as follows. [ Uxbridge ] [ South Harrow ] 4 July 1932: extended from Hammersmith to 23 October 1933 (after formation of the London Passenger Transport Board ): to Uxbridge { to Hounslow: the line from } [ Acton Town ] { was quadrupled to } [ Northfields ] { on 18 December 1932 and the Piccadilly line was extended: } [ Hounslow West ] 9 January 1933: to Northfields 13 March 1933: to, in conjunction with the eastern extension to Enfield West. These eastward and westward extensions are notable for the Modernist architecture of their new stations, many of them designed by Charles Holden, who was inspired by examples of Modernist architecture in mainland Europe. This influence can be seen in the bold vertical and horizontal forms, which were combined with the use of traditional materials like brick. [ Underground Journeys: Changing the face of London Underground http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Exhibitionsandloans/VARIBAArchitecturePartnershipexhibitions/UndergroundJourneys/ChangingthefaceofLondonUnderground/ChangingTheFaceOfLondonUnderground.aspx Royal Institute of British Architects 19 February 2011 ] Today, many of these Holden-designed station are listed building s. [ Victoria line ] During the planning stages of the Victoria line, a proposal was put forward to transfer [ Manor House ] station to the Victoria line, and also to build new &quot; direct &quot; tunnels from Finsbury Park to Turnpike Lane station, thereby cutting the journey time in and out of central London. This idea was eventually shelved due to the inconvenience to passengers that would have been caused during rebuilding, as well as the costs of the new tunnels. Even so, the Piccadilly line was still affected at Finsbury Park by the construction of the Victoria line. The westbound service was redirected through new tunnels, to give cross-platform interchange with the Victoria line on the platforms previously used by the Northern City Line. This work was completed in 1965, and the diversion came into use on 3 October 1965, three years before the opening of the first stage of the Victoria line. [ Heathrow extension ] Inside a Piccadilly line carriage In 1975, a new tunnel section was opened to [ Hatton Cross ] from Hounslow West. Hounslow West became a tunnel section station. In 1977, the branch was extended to Heathrow Central. This station was renamed Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 in 1984, with the opening of a one-way loop serving [ Heathrow Terminal 4 ], to the south of the central terminal area. From 7 January 2005 until 17 September 2006, the loop via Heathrow Terminal 4 was closed to allow the connection of a spur line to the now operational Heathrow Terminal 5 station. All underground services reverted to two-way working into Terminals 1, 2 and 3, which again became the temporary terminus; shuttle buses served Terminal 4 from the Hatton Cross bus station. For a brief period in summer 2006, the line terminated at Hatton Cross and shuttle buses also ran to Terminals 1, 2, 3 while the track configuration and tunnels were altered for the Terminal 5 link from that station. The station at Terminal 5 opened on 27 March 2008 on the same day Terminal 5 opened. [ 2005 terrorist attack ] [ 7 July 2005 London bombings ] On 7 July 2005, a Piccadilly line train was attacked by suicide bomber Germaine Lindsay. The blast occurred at 08:50 BST while the train was between [ King&apos;s Cross St. Pancras ] and [ Russell Square ]. It was part of a co-ordinated attack on London&apos;s transport network, and was synchronised with three other attacks – two on the Circle line and one on a bus at Tavistock Square. A small high-explosive device, concealed in a rucksack, was used. The Piccadilly line bomb resulted in the largest number of fatalities, with 26 people reported killed. Evacuation proved difficult as it is a deep-level line, difficult for the emergency services to reach. Parts of the line re-opened on 8 July, and full service was restored on 4 August, four weeks after the bomb. [ Infrastructure ] [ Rolling stock ] Piccadilly line trains of 1973 stock at Rayners Lane station Like virtually all Underground lines, the Piccadilly line is operated by a single type of rolling stock, in this case the 1973 tube stock, in the standard London Underground livery of blue, white and red. Seventy-nine trains out of a fleet of 86 are needed to run the line&apos;s peak service, and one unit (166-566-366) was severely damaged by the terrorist attack of 7 July 2005. The stock was recently refurbished. At some future date not yet determined, it is scheduled to be replaced with new rolling stock provisionally codenamed &apos;Evo&apos; (see &quot; Future &quot; section below). The line was previously worked by 1959 stock, 1956 stock, 1938 stock, standard tube stock and 1906 gate stock. The line has two depots, at Northfields [ map 55 map 55 ] and Cockfosters. [ map 54 map 54 ] There are sidings at Oakwood, South Harrow, Arnos Grove, Rayners Lane, Down Street, Wood Green, Acton Town, Ruislip and Uxbridge. [ Signalling ] The line is controlled from the control centre at Earl&apos;s Court, which it used to share with the District line. It is in need of resignalling, and this work was planned to be carried out by 2014, however this has been postponed for financial reasons. [ Service pattern ] The current off-peak service pattern is: [ Cockfosters ] [ Heathrow Terminal 5 ] [ Heathrow Terminal 4 ] [ Uxbridge ] [ Rayners Lane ] [ Northfields ] 6 trains per hour – (via Terminals 1, 2, 3) 6 trains per hour Cockfosters – (returning around the loop and serving Terminals 1, 2, 3) 3 trains per hour Cockfosters – 3 trains per hour Cockfosters – 6 trains per hour Arnos Grove – Often late evening services terminate at [ Oakwood ] instead of Cockfosters. Trains will also make an additional stop at [ Turnham Green ] during early mornings and late evenings but will not stop at the station during the main part of the day. Other services operate at times, especially at the start and towards the end of the traffic day.

It was at the end of a branch line from the main line at. An evening through-northbound &apos;Theatre&apos; train ran until 1910. From 1917 onwards, it was served only by a shuttle from Holborn. In the same year it was renamed Aldwych when Charing Cross on the Northern line was renamed Strand. It was temporarily closed in 1940 during World War II to be used as an air-raid shelter. It re-opened in 1946. The possibility of extending the branch to Waterloo was discussed, but the scheme never proceeded. Aldwych was finally closed on 30 September 1994; the level of use was said to be too low to justify the £1  million in estimated costs of a complete replacement of the lifts. The station is regularly used by film makers. [ Brompton Road ] [ Knightsbridge ] [ South Kensington ] opened 15 December 1906; closed 30 July 1934, between and.

This will involve new trains as well as new signalling, increasing the line&apos;s capacity by some 24% and reducing journey times by one fifth. [ Tube Upgrade plan: Piccadilly line http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18098.aspx Transport for London 15 May 2011 ] Bids for new rolling stock were originally submitted in 2008.

[ Ford Roger October 2010 Rolling stock famine deepens as Bombardier feasts on past orders Modern Railways 67 745 22 London ] LUL has invited Alstom, Bombardier and Siemens to develop a new concept of lightweight, low-energy, semi-articulated train for the deep-level lines, provisionally called &quot; Evo &quot; (for &apos;evolution&apos;). So far only Siemens has publicised an outline design, which would feature air-conditioning and would also have battery power enabling the train to run on to the next station if third and fourth rail power were lost. It would have a lower floor and 11% higher passenger capacity than the present tube stock.
