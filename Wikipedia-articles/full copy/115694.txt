Evidence indicates he was involved in the transfer of slaves from New Jersey to Louisiana in conflict with New Jersey law. { Pingeon, Frances D., &quot; An Abominable Business: The New Jersey Slave Trade, 1818 &quot;, &quot; New Jersey History &quot;, Vol. 109, 3/4, (1991) } The U.S. Post Office opened in 1847, closed some years later, and reopened in 1899.

To commend the centennial anniversary of the Village of Morganza, U.S. Congressman Rodney Alexander entered the following into the Congressional Record on December 10, 2008: [ Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the Centennial Anniversary of the Village of Morganza. Named after the first American sheriff of Pointe Coupee Parish, Colonel Charles Morgan, the Village of Morganza was incorporated in 1908. Originally from Pennsylvania, Morgan came to Pointe Coupee Parish in 1830. He was a prominent land-owner in the parish, and served in the Louisiana Legislature and represented the Mississippi River Authority. During the Civil War, the Village of Morganza was the site of a Union Army encampment. Several battles were fought in this area throughout the war. The largest conflict in Pointe Coupee Parish occurred at nearby Stirling Plantation, on September 29, 1863. Just before the turn of the 20th century, the Morganza Post Office was organized, and the Town Hall was built in 1968. St. Ann&apos;s Catholic Church was founded in 1916, but was so severely damaged by storms in 1934 and 1935, the structure was later destroyed. The present church building was dedicated in October 1935. The Village of Morganza is perhaps best known for the Morganza Spillway which helps control flooding on the lower Mississippi River. It is also commonly known for featured scenes in the movie ” Easy Rider ” in 1968. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Centennial Anniversary of the Village of Morganza. I am proud of the residents of this historical community for ensuring its charm and spirit is as strong today as it was 100 years prior. Hon. Rodney Alexander of Louisiana. &quot; Commending The Centennial Anniversary Of The Village Of Morganza. &quot; Congressional Record Extension of Remarks 154:E2364-01 (Wednesday, December 10, 2008) p. E2364-01. Accessed: May 14, 2011. ] [ Civil War ] Morganza was the site of a Union Army encampment during the American Civil War. The largest battle in Pointe Coupee Parish was fought at nearby Sterling Plantation, on September 29, 1863. Sixteen Federal troops were killed, 45 were wounded, and 462 were taken prisoner. The Confederate losses included 26 dead, 85 wounded, and 10 missing. Although the Battle of Sterling Plantation was a Confederate victory, the Union troops burned the town of Morganza to the ground on October 1, 1863. { Lockhart, John M. &quot; Roadmap to the Westside &quot;, The Riverside Reader, January 21, 2008, p. 1 } Historian John D. Winters in The Civil War in Louisiana (1963) documents the arrival in May 1864 of Federal troops in Morganza under General Nathaniel P. Banks, recently defeated in the Battle of Mansfield in De Soto Parish and abandoning the Red River Campaign. According to Winters, &quot; The unbearable heat drove the men to construct arbors and bowers to shield themselves from the sun. In a short time an orderly city of tents and company streets stretched along the banks of the river between the water and the levee. Early in the morning and in the late evening the troops were called out for drill periods and gymnastic sports, but most of the day they were free. They spent much of this time lounging in their tents and in the shade, wearing as little clothing as regulations would allow. Some of the men braved the sun and went fishing, or swimming, or visited the sutlers&apos; tents. For more than a month the sweating troops lazed away the long, hot summer days with only an occasional review or alarm to break the monotony. &quot; The heat and the excessive rainfall began to tell upon the troops... Epidemics of scurvy, chronic diarrhea, swamp fever, and smallpox began to take an appalling toll. Many times a day the death march sounded, and new victims were carried to their graves along the river bank. &quot;. { John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, } { Baton Rouge : } { Louisiana State University Press, 1963, ISBN 0-8071-0834-0, p. 38 } [ Periodic flooding ] Located at the lower end of a sharp bend of the Mississippi River, Morganza has been subjected to flooding of the great river a number of times.
