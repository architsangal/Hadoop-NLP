It is commonly known simply as Synaspismos ( [ Συνασπισμός, Synaspismós ], &quot; Coalition &quot; ) and abbreviated to SYN (ΣΥΝ). Until 2003, it was called the Coalition of the Left and Progress ( [ Συνασπισμός της Αριστεράς και της Προόδου, Synaspismós tīs Aristerás kai tīs Proódou ] ). SYN is the largest party of a left-wing political coalition formed in 2004 called Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA). On 10 February 2008 engineer Alexis Tsipras was elected party president, replacing Alekos Alavanos, who stepped down citing private reasons. At that time Tsipras did not hold a parliamentary seat, so Alavanos remained leader of the parliamentary group. After the legislative elections in 2009, Tsipras entered Parliament and became leader of the SYRIZA parliamentary group. [ History ] [ Coalition, late 1980s–1991 ] Synaspismos emerged initially as an electoral coalition at the late 1980s, with the two Greek Communist Parties (the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and Greek Left, the successor to the eurocommunist Communist Party of Greece (Interior) ) as its largest constituents. The disintegration of USSR brought the Left into disunion, and the traditional majority within KKE purged all non-hardliners from the party - almost 45% of the Central Committee members, including ex-general secretary Grigoris Farakos, and majorities in many Local Committees (named by the KKE majority as revisionists and by the press as the renewers), and also split from the coalition.

Although the &apos;experiment&apos; seemed to have great potential, serious ideological conflicts were afflicting the new party. At the legislative elections of 1993, SYN failed (for 2,000 votes) to pass the limit of 3% and enter the National Parliament. But next year, Synaspismos got its highest national &apos;score&apos; ever (6,26%) in the 1994 elections for the European Parliament. Two years later, with 5,12%, got its highest score in 1996 elections for the Greek Parliament. Former Synaspismos leader Alekos Alavanos giving a speech at a SYRIZA rally in Athens In the legislative elections of 2000, SYN was supported by the small Renewing Communist Ecological Left (AKOA) party and a small group of ecologists. After the elections a few members of the National Committee, who were asking for approximation with the social democrats, left the party accusing the majority of neo-communist turn and created the short-lived party AEKA. AEKA was first split and little later disbanded in some months, when the head of the party became an Undersecretary in the socialdemocratic administration of Kostas Simitis. In the legislative elections of 2004, Synaspismos, together with several smaller parties (AKOA, Movement for the United in Action Left (KEDA), Internationalist Workers Left (DEA, Active Citizens)), formed an alliance called Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), but contested the Euro-elections of the same year on its own, because of ideological disagreements within the party. The alliance with the smaller parties was formed again at the end of 2005, when chairman Alavanos proposed the 30-year-old Alexis Tsipras as candidate mayor of Athens for the Municipal Election of 2006, proclaiming the party&apos;s &quot; overture to a younger generation &quot;. The Tsipras candidacy was received well, especially so by younger voters, and formed the party&apos;s springboard for its good 2007 parliamentary elections showing.

[ Ideological identity ] [ section May 2012 ] SYN describes itself as a radical left party, inspired by the ideas of the renewal of the communist and broader left movement in Greece and in Europe. It also fights for the merging of the ecological movement along with the left, to form a strategic alliance. The party&apos;s culture has been enriched by its active participation in the movement against the Neoliberal Capitalist Globalization. Synaspismos aspires to be an &quot; canopy party &quot;; where, under the party flag, one can find people of varying ideological and theoretical backgrounds. Therefore, SYN members are encouraged to form, or participate in, intra-party platforms on the basis of kinship in ideology. Platforms mount open discussions and publish magazines, but may not work against party consensus decisions. The role of the platforms is vital especially in congresses, because each of them proposes a thesis on party strategy and presents its own ballot of candidates for the National Committee. In the National Committee elected by the last Congress (5 February 2008), the rank (in terms of representation) is the following: &quot; Left Stream &quot; (mainstream western Marxism, party center-left), &quot; Renewing Wing &quot; (radical social democracy, party right), the &quot; Red-green Network &quot; (eco-Marxism, party left) and the &quot; Initiative &quot; (eurosceptic Marxism, party extreme left). Since 2004 the Left Stream, the Red-greens and the Initiative form the so-called Left Majority, which is responsible for moving the party to most radical leftist positions. Note: the exact word used is &quot; τάσεις &quot; ( &quot; tendencies &quot; ), but the term platform is more accurate in English. [ Representation &amp; amp; international alliances ] Current chairman Alexis Tsipras The party has members in the National and European Parliament. After having survived the crisis of not achieving parliamentary representation in 1993, Synaspismos has, since 1996, been the fourth party in the Greek Parliament, and the third party (in terms of representation) in local government. In the European Parliament SYN is a member of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left group, and also a member of the European Social Forum. Moreover, SYN hosted the 1st Congress of European Left (29–30 October 2005), which formulated the Athens Declaration of the European Left as the manifesto of the European Left party. Well-known executive members of Synaspismos are: Alexis Tsipras, Alekos Alavanos, Giannis Dragasakis, Nikos Konstantopoulos, Panagiotis Lafazanis et al. Synaspismos is closely connected with the following: The Athens daily newspaper ΑΥΓΗ (Dawn) The Athens radio station &quot; 105.5 FM - Στο Κóκκινο &quot; (In Red). The &quot; Nicos Poulantzas &quot; Institute for Political Research The Archive of Modern Social History (ΑΣKI) [ Structure ] The structure of SYN consists of three levels: The Chairperson of SYN is elected by the Congress and is a primus inter pares member of both the CPC and the Secretariat. [ SYN youth ] SYN Youth Logo { Coalition of the Radical Left rally } SYN&apos;s youth organisation is Neolaia SYN (Νεολαία ΣΥΝ, SYN Youth), which is autonomous from the party structure. Until the late 1990s they were called &quot; Left Youth League &quot; (Ένωση Aριστερών Νέων). N-SYN have their own membership and executive bodies, but in general their decisions and activity are similar to the ones of the party. Their power is noteworthy in most Student Councils all around Greece, through the DIKTYO (Δίκτυο, &quot; Network &quot; ). N-SYN also participates in the European Network of Democratic Young Left (ENDYL).
