The term is generally used to refer to the wave of rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late 1960s and early 1970s, beginning with Bob Dylan and The Byrds; reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists like Emmylou Harris and the Eagles. [ History ] Rock and roll has often been seen as a combination of rhythm and blues with country music, a fusion particularly evident in 1950s rockabilly, { B. Horner and T. Swiss, Key terms in popular music and culture (Wiley-Blackwell, 1999), p. 104. } and there has been cross-pollination throughout the history of both genres, however, the term country-rock is generally used to refer to the wave of rock musicians of the late 1960s and early 1970s who began to record rock records using country themes, vocal styles and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitar. { V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), p. 1327. } [ Origins ] Country influences can be heard on rock records through the 1960s, including tracks on the Beatles for Sale album (1964) (including &quot; I&apos;ll Cry Instead &quot;, &quot; Baby&apos;s in Black &quot; and &quot; I Don&apos;t Want to Spoil the Party &quot; ), on the Rolling Stones &quot; High and Dry &quot; (1966), as well as Buffalo Springfield &apos;s &quot; Go and Say Goodbye &quot; (1966) and &quot; Kind Woman &quot; (1968). In 1966, as many rock artists moved increasingly towards expansive and experimental psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to-basics roots revival when he went to Nashville to record the album Blonde on Blonde, using notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy. This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, John Wesley Harding (1967) and Nashville Skyline (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians. { K. Wolff, O. Duane, Country Music: The Rough Guide (Rough Guides, 2000), p. 392. } Dylan&apos;s lead was also followed by The Byrds, who were joined by Gram Parsons in 1968. Earlier in the year Parsons had released Safe at Home (although the principal recording for the album had taken place in mid-1967) with the International Submarine Band, which made extensive use of pedal steel and is seen by some as the first true country-rock album. The result of Parsons&apos; brief tenure in the Byrds was Sweetheart of the Rodeo (1968), generally considered one of the finest and most influential recordings in the genre. The Byrds continued for a brief period in the same vein, but Parsons left soon after the album was released to be joined by another ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming The Flying Burrito Brothers. Over the next two years they recorded the albums The Gilded Palace of Sin (1969) and Burrito Deluxe (1970), which helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career. The Monkees recorded the Michael Murphey/&apos;Boomer&apos; Castleman composed &quot; What Am I Doing Hangin&apos; Round? &quot; in June 1967, which would be seen by many as a landmark in the fusion of country and rock, which had a lot of un-country things in it, like a familiar change from a I major to a VI major, so that it didn&apos;t sound like the country songs of the time. { Andrew Sandoval, The Monkees: The Day by Day Story of the &apos;60s Pop Sensation (Thunder Bay Press, 2005), p. 118. } The previous year, on July 7, 1966, The Monkees recorded the Michael Nesmith composed &quot; Papa Gene&apos;s Blues &quot;, which mixed country, rock and Latin flavors, and in early 1967 had added pedal steel guitar to various songs on their Headquarters album. { Sandoval (2005), p. 40. } [ Peak ] { Emmylou Harris, the &quot; Queen of country rock &quot;, playing in } { Rotterdam, } { Netherlands (2006) } Country rock was a particularly popular style in the California music scene of the late 1960s, and was adopted by bands including Hearts and Flowers, Poco (formed by Richie Furay and Jim Messina, formerly of the Buffalo Springfield) and New Riders of the Purple Sage. Some folk-rockers followed the Byrds into the genre, among them the Beau Brummels and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. { P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 730. } A number of performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Everly Brothers, whose Roots album (1968) is usually considered some of their finest work; former teen idol Rick Nelson who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band; John Fogerty, who left Creedence Clearwater Revival behind for the country sounds of The Blue Ridge Rangers; { J. Dougan, &quot; Blue Ridge Rangers: Biography &quot;, Allmusic, retrieved 9 April 2011. } Mike Nesmith who formed the First National Band after this departure from the Monkees, and during his tenure with The Monkees had integrated the Nashville country sound into rock, using instruments such as the Dobro, mandolin and banjo { Sandoval (2005). }; and Neil Young who moved in and out of the genre throughout his career. One of the few acts to successfully move from the country side towards rock were the bluegrass band The Dillards. Dickey Betts of The Allman Brothers Band, Brought elements of Country Rock into the band during the 1970s. The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s, with the Doobie Brothers mixing in elements of R &amp; B, Emmylou Harris (a former backing singer for Parsons) becoming the &quot; Queen of country-rock &quot; and Linda Ronstadt creating a highly successful pop-oriented brand of the genre. Pure Prairie League, formed in Ohio in 1969 by Craig Fuller, had both critical and commercial success with 5 straight Top 40 LP releases, { W. Ruhlmann, &quot; Pure Prairie League: Biography &quot;, Allmusic, retrieved 8 April 2011. } including Bustin&apos; Out (1972), acclaimed by Allmusic critic Richard Foss as &quot; an album that is unequaled in country-rock &quot; [ R. Foss Bustin&apos; Out Pure Prairie League: Review Allmusic http://www.allmusic.com/album/bustin-out-r15920/review http://www.webcitation.org/5xoLcZ7uh 9 April 2011 ] {. } and Two Lane Highway, described by Rolling Stone Magazine as &quot; a worthy companion to the likes of The Byrds&apos; Sweetheart Of The Rodeo and other gems of the genre &quot;. { Rolling Stone Magazine #194 August 28, 1975. } Former members of Ronstadt&apos;s backing band went on to form the Eagles (made up of members of the Flying Burrito Brothers, Poco and Stone Canyon Band), who emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included Desperado (1973) and Hotel California (1976). { N. E. Tawa, Supremely American: popular song in the 20th century: styles and singers and what they said about America (Scarecrow Press, 2005), pp. 227-8. } [ Legacy ] Outside of these handful of stars, country rock&apos;s greatest significance was as an influence on artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones and George Harrison &apos;s solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock, which, although largely derived from blues-rock, had a distinct southern lilt, and it paved the way for parts of the alternative country movement. The genre declined in popularity in the late 1970s, but some established artists, including Neil Young, have continued to record country-tinged rock into the twenty-first century. Country rock has survived as a cult force in Texas, where acts including The Flatlanders, Joe Ely, Butch Hancock, Jimmy Dale Gilmore and California-based Richard Brooker, have collaborated and recorded. { P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), pp. 145-6. } Other performers have produced occasional recordings in the genre, including Elvis Costello &apos;s Almost Blue (1981) and the Robert Plant and Alison Krauss collaboration Raising Sand, which was one of the most commercially successful albums of 2007. { &quot; The Top 50 Albums of 2007 &quot;. } { Rolling Stone.
