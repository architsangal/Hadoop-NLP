It is the most populous commune in the Ardèche department, although it is not the capital, which resides in the smaller town of Privas. [ Geography ] Annonay lies a few kilometres from the river Rhône, [ 75 km mi on ] south of Lyon and 40 from Saint-Étienne. Annonay is built on the hill over the deep gorges of the Deûme and the Cance and upon the steep walls of the gorges themselves, the waters of which supplied power to the factories of the town in a series of small dams up and downstream. the escarpments of annonay are surrounded by plateaus and gentle hills used for cultivating cherries, apricots, apples, pears, and crops. By means of a dam across the Ternay, an affluent of the Deûme, to the north-west of the town, a reservoir is provided, in which an additional supply of water, for both industrial and domestic purposes, is stored. The rocks of annonay consist of mostly grey or light orange leucogranite and orthogneiss rich in biotite, sillimanite and corderite with alternating bands of felsic and mafic material. [ History ] { Montgolfier brothers &apos; historic balloon. } The town&apos;s name may be of Roman origin. By the Middle Ages, the town was already thriving and was the home to several powerful families. Pilgrim s stopped in the town on the way from the Rhône valley to the shrine of the Virgin Mary at Puy-en-Velay. The town was plundered several times by invading armies and armed bands, and suffered during the Hundred Years&apos; War, despite the walls that were built around the town. In the first half of the 16th century, the town was influenced by Lutheran and Calvinist ideas and there were several skirmishes between protestant s and catholic s, with several &quot; heretics &quot; being burnt alive. The population had reached 3,500 by the start of the religious war s in 1562. The war s were used as a pretext to deprive the town of its prosperity. The nearby castle of Pugneux was badly damaged on two occasions. 1585 to 1586 were especially disastrous, with not only war, but famine and the plague. Calm and prosperity retunded after the 1598 Edict of Nantes. On June 4, 1783, Annonay was the location of the Montgolfier brothers first public unmanned hot air balloon flight. The event is celebrated annually each June, on the site of the flight in the place des Cordeliers. The Montgolfier brothers were natives of the town, and there is an obelisk in honour of them. In 1822, the Congregation of St. Basil, a Catholic order of priests was founded. On March 8, 2001, an ETA suspect was arrested at a local roadblock.
