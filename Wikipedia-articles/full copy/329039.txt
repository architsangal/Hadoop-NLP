[ Geography ] Kariya is situated in central Aichi Prefecture. [ Neighboring municipalities ] Toyota Ōbu Anjō Chiryū Takahama Toyoake Miyoshi Tōgō Higashirua [ History ] Kariya was a castle town in the Sengoku period, in an area contested between the Imagawa clan, Oda clan and various local warlords, including the Mizuno clan and Matsudaira clan. Tokugawa Ieyasu ’s maternal grandfather Mizuno Tadamasa rebuilt Kariya Castle in the mid-16th century. The Mizuno clan shifted allegiances adroitly between the Imagawa clan to Oda Nobunaga and to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who relocated the clan to Ise Province. However, Mizuno Katsunari, the grandson of Tadamasa was allowed to return to the clan’s ancestral territories by Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara as daimyo of Kariya Domain a feudal han under the Tokugawa shogunate. The domain was reassigned to numerous clans during the Edo period, but was retained by the Doi clan from 1734 until the Meiji restoration. After the Meiji restoration, Kariya Town was created within Hekikai District, Aichi Prefecture on October 1, 1889. The town prospered as a center for commerce, sake production, sericulture and ceramics due to its location on the main railway routes. The Yosami Transmitting Station, located in Kariya, was Japan’s tallest structure when completed in 1929. Kariya achieved city status on April 1, 1950. The city expanded by annexation of neighboring Fujimatsu and most of Yosami villages on April 1, 1955. Control of the Yosami Transmitting Station was returned to Japan from the United States Navy in 1994, and the former facility is now a city park. [ Economy ] The economy of Kariya is dominated by companies related to Toyota Motor Corporation, including Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki and Denso Corporation. Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Toyodajidoshoki, was the original company of Toyota Motor Corporation, and later became a subsidiary of that firm. Because the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was so highly profitable, board members decided to reinvest much of the profits into the growing automobile manufacturing business [ Transportation ] [ Railway ] [ Higashi-Kariya ] [ Noda-Shimmachi ] [ Kariya ] [ Aizuma ] [ Hitotsugi ] [ Fujimatsu ] { Meitetsu – } { Mikawa Line } [ Kariya ] [ Kariyashi ] [ Ogakie ] [ Highway ] Isewangan Expressway Japan National Route 1 Japan National Route 23 Japan National Route 155 Japan National Route 419 [ Education ] Aichi University of Education [ Sister cities ] [ Canada ] – Mississauga, Ontario, Canada [ Noted people from Kariya ] On Kawara – artist Nobuyuki Sato – marathon runner Koji Kondo – professional soccer player Mitsunori Yoshida – professional soccer player Norihiro Akahoshi – professional baseball player Yoshifumi Ayukawa - professional baseball player [ References ] [ External links ] [ Kariya, Aichi ] [ http://www.city.kariya.lg.jp/wwwe_data/index.html ] Aichi University of Education Aichi University of Education Library Kariya Lutheran Church Mississauga Sister City Site Category:Cities in Aichi Prefecture ar:كارييا، آيتشي de:Kariya (Aichi) es:Kariya (Aichi) fa:کاریا، آیچی fr:Kariya gl:Kariya ko:가리야 시 it:Kariya lt:Karija (Japonija) nl:Kariya ja:刈谷市 pnb:کاریہ pl:Kariya pt:Kariya ro:Kariya, Aichi ru:Кария (Айти) fi:Kariya sv:Kariya tl:Kariya, Aitsi tg:Кария uk:Карія (Айті) vi:Kariya war:Kariya, Aichi zh:刈谷市
