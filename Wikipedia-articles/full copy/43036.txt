{ supermarket in } { Houston, Texas } The Scoville scale is a measurement of the spicy heat (or piquance ) of a chili pepper. The number of Scoville heat units (SHU) { K. V. Peter (ed), Handbook of Herbs and Spices Vol 1, CRC Press, 2001 ISBN 0-8493-1217-5 page 120 } indicates the amount of capsaicin present. Capsaicin is a chemical compound that stimulates chemoreceptor nerve ending s in the skin, especially the mucous membranes; pure capsaicin has a Scoville rating of 16,000,000 SHU. The scale is named after its creator, American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville. His method, devised in 1912, is known as the Scoville Organoleptic Test. { The Journal of the American Pharmacists Association 1912; 1:453–4 } The modern commonplace method for quantitative analysis uses high-performance liquid chromatography, making it possible to directly measure capsaicinoid content. [ Food ] [ Scoville organoleptic test ] In Scoville&apos;s method, an alcohol extract of the capsaicin oil from a measured amount of dried pepper is added incrementally to a solution of sugar in water until the &quot; heat &quot; is just detectable by a panel of (usually five) tasters; the degree of dilution gives its measure on the Scoville scale. Thus a sweet pepper or a bell pepper, containing no capsaicin at all, has a Scoville rating of zero, meaning no heat detectable. The hottest chilis, such as habaneros and nagas, have a rating of 200,000 or more, indicating that their extract must be diluted over 200,000 times before the capsaicin presence is undetectable. The greatest weakness of the Scoville Organoleptic Test is its imprecision, because it relies on human subjectivity. Tasters taste only one sample per session. [ High-performance liquid chromatography ] [ Naga Jolokia ( bhut jolokia, naga morich ) is rated at over one million Scoville units. It is primarily found in Bangladesh and parts of the Northeast Indian states of Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. Red Savina pepper, one of the hottest chilis, is rated at 580,000 Scoville units. ] Spice heat is usually measured by a method that uses high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This identifies and measures the concentration of heat-producing chemicals. The measurements are used in a mathematical formula that weights them according to their relative capacity to produce a sensation of heat. This method yields results, not in Scoville units, but in American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) pungency units. A measurement of one part capsaicin per million corresponds to about 15 Scoville units, and the published method says that ASTA pungency units can be multiplied by 15 and reported as Scoville units. This conversion is approximate, and spice experts Donna R. Tainter and Anthony T. Grenis say that there is consensus that it gives results about 20–40% lower than the actual Scoville method would have given. Results vary widely, up to 50%, between laboratories. [ Tainter Donna R.

However, labs that run these procedures could generate reasonably repeatable results. ] [ List of Scoville ratings ] [ Scoville ratings of chemicals ] Scoville heat units Examples 16,000,000,000 Resiniferatoxin 5,300,000,000 Tinyatoxin 16,000,000 Capsaicin 15,000,000 Dihydrocapsaicin 9,200,000 Nonivamide 9,100,000 Nordihydrocapsaicin 8,600,000 Homocapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin 160,000 Shogaol 100,000 Piperine 60,000 Gingerol 16,000 Capsiate [ Scoville ratings of peppers ] [ http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Czarnecki/chemical_hazards_in_law_enforcement.htm Chemical hazards in law enforcement The Police Policy Studies Council 2009-02-09 Most law enforcement sprays have a pungency of 500,000 to 2 million SHU.

Pungency values for any pepper are variable, due to expected variation within a species easily by a factor of 10 or more depending on seed lineage, climate (humidity is a big factor for the Bhut Jolokia; the Dorset Naga and the original Naga have quite different ratings), and even soil (this is especially true of habanero s ). The inaccuracies described in the measurement methods above also contribute to the imprecision of these values. When interpreting Scoville ratings, this should be kept in mind. The Scoville scale may be extrapolated to express the pungency of substances that are even hotter than pure capsaicin. One such substance is resiniferatoxin, an alkaloid present in the sap of some species of euphorbia plants (spurges). Since it is 1000 times as hot as capsaicin, it would have a Scoville scale rating of 16 billion. { Atala, Anthony, and Debra Slade (2003), Bladder Disease, (Washington DC: National Bladder Foundation), p. 361. } [ References ] [ 2 ] *Scoville scale Category:1912 introductions [ de ] ar:مقياس سكوفيل bg:Скала на Сковил ca:Escala Scoville cs:Scovilleho stupnice da:Scoville de:Scoville-Skala es:Escala Scoville fa:مقیاس اسکویل fr:Échelle de Scoville ko:스코빌 척도 hr:Scovillova skala id:Skala Scoville it:Scala di Scoville he:סולם סקוביל kn:ಸ್ಕೋವಿಲ್ lb:Scoville-Skala hu:Scoville-skála nl:Scovilleschaal ja:スコヴィル値 no:Scovillegrader nn:Scovilleskalaen pl:Skala Scoville&apos;a pt:Escala de Scoville ru:Жгучий вкус sr:Сковил fi:Scovillen asteikko sv:Scoville tr:Scoville Acılık Ölçeği uk:Пекучий смак vi:Độ cay Scoville zh:史高維爾指標
