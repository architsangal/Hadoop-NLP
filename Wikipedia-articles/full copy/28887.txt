[ http://www.snp.org/about About SNP Snp.org 20 April 2010 ] In the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary election, the SNP became the largest political party in the Scottish Parliament for the first time, governing as a minority administration, with party leader Alex Salmond as First Minister of Scotland. At the 2011 Scottish Parliamentary election, the SNP won a landslide victory [ http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/features/Salmond39s-Government-in-focus-100.6822242.jp Salmond&apos;s Government in focus: 100 days is a long time in politics Barnes Eddie 21 August 2011 The Scotsman 23 August 2011 ] and became the first party to form a majority government in the Scottish Parliament since its resumption in 1999.

The SNP is also currently the largest group in Scottish local government and, in coalition, forms 12 out of 32 local administrations. [ History ] [ History of the Scottish National Party ] The SNP was formed in 1934 through the merger of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party. Professor Douglas Young, who was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945 fought for the Scottish people to refuse conscription and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the British war effort against the Axis powers. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted. The SNP first won a parliamentary seat at the Motherwell by-election in 1945, but Dr Robert McIntyre MP lost the seat at the general election three months later. They next won a seat in 1967, when Winnie Ewing was the surprise winner of a by-election in the previously safe Labour seat of Hamilton. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the Kilbrandon Commission. The high point in a British General Elections thus far was when the SNP polled almost a third of all votes in Scotland at the October 1974 general election and returned 11 MPs to Westminster, to date the most MPs it has had, although its representation was reduced significantly in the 1979 general election. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1979_over.stm VOTE2001 &amp; #124; THE ELECTION BATTLES 1945-1997 BBC News 2011-12-20 ] In the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary election the SNP emerged as the largest party with 47 seats, narrowly ousting the Scottish Labour Party with 46 seats and Alex Salmond became Scottish First Minister. Between 2007 and 2011, the Scottish Green Party supported the appointment of the SNP government under an agreement which also specified areas of common policy and gave the Greens input to the budget process and convenorship of the parliamentary committee on transport, infrastructure and climate change. In May 2011 the SNP won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament with 69 seats. Overall majorities are unusual in the Additional Member system that is used for elections to the Scottish Parliament, which was specially designed by the Labour UK government in 1999 to prevent any party gaining overall control of the parliament. &quot; [ http://www.channel4.com/news/alex-salmonds-snp-wins-majority-in-scottish-elections alex-salmonds-snp-wins-majority-in-scottish-elections channel4.com 12 July 2011 ] [ Party leaders ] Alexander MacEwan (1934–1936) Andrew Dewar Gibb (1936–1940) William Power (1940–1942) Douglas Young (1942–1945) Bruce Watson (1945–1947) Robert McIntyre (1947–1956) James Halliday (1956–1960) Arthur Donaldson (1960–1969) William Wolfe (1969–1979) Gordon Wilson (1979–1990) Alex Salmond (1990–2000) John Swinney (2000–2004) Alex Salmond (2004–present) [ Party presidents ] Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham (1934–1936) Roland Muirhead (1936–1950) Tom Gibson (1950–1958) Robert McIntyre (1958–1980) William Wolfe (1980–1982) Donald Stewart (1982–1987) Winnie Ewing (1987–2005) Ian Hudghton (2005–present) [ Scottish parliamentary leaders ] Alex Salmond (1999–2000) John Swinney (2000–2004) Nicola Sturgeon (2004–2007) Alex Salmond (2007–present) [ Westminster parliamentary leaders ] Donald Stewart (1974–1987) Margaret Ewing (1987–1999) Alasdair Morgan (1999–2001) Alex Salmond (2001–2007) Angus Robertson (2007–present) [ Party organisation ] { Galashiels. The design was changed in 2012 when it was found to have breached rules regarding the use of party symbols on constituency offices } The SNP consists of local branches of party members. Those branches then form an association in the constituency they represent (unless there is only one branch in the constituency, in which case it forms a constituency branch rather than a constituency association). There are also eight regional associations, to which the branches and constituency associations can send delegates. The SNP&apos;s policy structure is developed at its annual national conference and its regular national council meetings. There are also regular meetings of its national assembly, at which detailed discussion (but not finalising) of party policy takes place. The party has an active youth wing, the Young Scots for Independence, as well as a student wing, the Federation of Student Nationalists. There is also an SNP Trade Union Group. There is an independently-owned monthly newspaper, The Scots Independent, which is highly supportive of the party. The SNP&apos;s leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC) which is made up of the party&apos;s elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference). The SNP parliamentarians (Scottish, Westminster and European) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing. According to accounts filed with the Electoral Commission for the year ending 2010, the party had a membership of 16232, { http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/119450/Scottish-National-Party-SoA-2010.pdf } up from 15,097 in 2008 and 9,450 in 2003. { SNP&apos;s membership surges by 60%, } { The Scotsman, 1 January 2009 } In 2004 the party had income of approximately £1,300,000 (including bequest s of just under £300,000) and expenditure of about £1,000,000. [ January 2009 ] [ Policy platform ] The SNP&apos;s policy base is mostly in the mainstream European social-democratic mould. For example, among its policies are a commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament, progressive personal taxation, the eradication of poverty, free state education including support grants for higher education students and a pay increase for nurses. It is also committed to an independent Scotland being a full member state of the European Union, to the country joining the Euro currency at the appropriate exchange rate both of which are not guaranteed but rather subject to negotiation should the country become independent. The SNP is against membership of NATO (however this remains controversial). Contrary to the expectations of many outside the party, the SNP is not expressly republican, and its general view is that this is an issue secondary to that of Scottish independence. Many SNP members are republicans, however, and both the party student and youth wings are expressly so. [ October 2011 ] However, the current stance of the SNP is that an independent Scotland would retain the monarchy which it currently has as part of the United Kingdom. In August 2009 as part of its third legislative term in the Scottish Parliament, the Government proposes to debate the Scottish referendum bill 2010, which would set out a planned referendum for 30th [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8526938.stm Plans for special body to run independence referendum BBC News 21 February 2010 20 April 2010 ] November 2010 on the issue of Scottish independence. It was not however expected to pass, due to opposition from all the major opposition parties in the Parliament.

It had by then established a National Assembly which allowed for discussion of policy and was producing papers on a host of policy issues that could be described as based on social democracy. Also, the emergence of William Wolfe (universally known as Billy) as a leading figure played a huge role in the SNP defining itself as a left-of-centre and social-democratic party. He recognised the need to do this to challenge the dominant political position of the Scottish Labour Party. He achieved this in a number of ways: establishing the SNP Trade Union Group; promoting centre-left policies; and identifying the SNP with labour campaigns (such as the Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish Daily Express to run as a cooperative ). It was during Wolfe&apos;s period as SNP leader in the 1970s that the SNP became clearly identified as a social-democratic political party. There were some ideological tensions in the 1970s SNP. The party leadership under Wolfe was determined to stay on the left of the Scottish political spectrum and be in a position to challenge the Labour Party. However, the party&apos;s MPs, mostly representing seats won from the Scottish Conservatives, were less keen to have the SNP viewed as a centre-left alternative to Labour, for fear of losing their seats back to the Conservatives. There were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979 with the 79 Group attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a &apos;social-democratic&apos; party, to an expressly &apos; socialist &apos; party. 79 Group members including current leader, Alex Salmond, were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland from those who wanted the SNP to remain a &apos;broad church&apos;, apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, for example running campaigns against the poll tax. It developed this platform to the stage it is at now: a clear, moderate, centre-left political party. This has itself not gone without internal criticism from the left of the party who believe that in modern years the party has become too moderate. The ideological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by the arguments between the so-called SNP gradualist s and SNP fundamentalist s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a &apos;step-by-step&apos; strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, although much of the 79 Group was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position. This grouping of &quot; neo-fundamentalists &quot; have their roots within the camp of the former high-profile Labour Party MP Jim Sillars who left Labour to form the short-lived Scottish Labour Party in 1976 (the party had no connection with the UK Labour Party or the current Scottish Labour group in the Scottish Parliament). Sillars eventually joined the SNP, winning the Govan, Glasgow, by-election in 1988 to become an SNP MP. He lost the Westminster seat at the 1992 general election and expressed his disappointment by calling the Scottish people &apos;Ninety minute patriots&apos;. Many political analysts recognize that the commitment of ordinary members and leaders to independence is so strong that comments about tensions are somewhat overblown and driven by the wishful thinking of unionist sympathisers. Some commentators have suggested the there are elements of the SNP party ideology which are anglophobic, something which has been denied by spokespeople for the party itself. [ European affiliation ] The SNP retains close links with Plaid Cymru, its counterpart in Wales. MPs of both parties co-operate closely with each other. They work as a single group within the House of Commons, and were involved in joint campaigning during the 2005 General Election campaign. Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru are members of the European Free Alliance (EFA), a European political party for regionalist national-level political parties. The EFA co-operates with the larger European Green Party to form the Group of The Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament. Prior to its affiliation with The Greens–European Free Alliance, the SNP had previously been allied with the European Progressive Democrats (until 1984), Rainbow Group (1989–1994) and European Radical Alliance (1994–1999).

[ Criticism ] [ Accusations of Anglophobia ] The SNP have been accused of being Anglophobic.

Indeed, McKee is one of six SNP MSPs born in England, along with other prominent figures such as Christine Grahame and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning Mike Russell. [ Accusations of &quot; cash for policies &quot; ] The party has been criticised over a £500,000 donation from the socially conservative transport businessman Brian Souter. One month later, in April 2007, the SNP&apos;s commitment (made at the party&apos;s 2006 conference) to re-regulate the bus network was not included in their 2007 manifesto, although the SNP denies any direct link.
