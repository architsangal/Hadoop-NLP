As of the 2010 census, the town population was 151. [ History ] The history of Foss began when settlers from the area of the Wilson post office moved four miles north to the valley of Turkey Creek in the late 1890s. They initially wanted their new post office to be called Graham, but since that name was already taken it was named Maharg. A flash flood on May 2, 1902 wiped out the town on Turkey Creek, destroying businesses and drowning several people. The town rebuilt on higher ground and was named Foss. The post office began operation on September 15, 1900.

By 1905 the town had a population between 900 and 1000 residents. It boasted two bank s, three cotton gin s, and by 1912 had an electric plant, two hotel s and an opera house. [ Morris 1977 86. ] The population stabilized near 500. In the 1920s the town began to have problems and the nearby cities of Clinton and Elk City absorbed more and more trade. During the Great Depression more people moved away. During World War II, the town boasted a population of over 300 residents, relying primarily on Route 66 travellers (which passed half a mile south of the city) and a U.S. naval base south of the town that operated during wartime. A gas station and a café also operated in the town around that time. Though in the 1950s and 1960s there was an economic revival due to the nearby Air Force installation at Burns Flat. When the base closed and Interstate 40 bypassed Foss the town declined further. The last bank left in September 1977. Foss had two newspaper s, the Foss Enterprise and the Foss Banner. It was served by the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (Rock Island) railroad.
