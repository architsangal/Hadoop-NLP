[ History ] [ April 2011 ] [ April 2011 ] In January 1789, Abraham Covalt established a small fortified settlement called Covalt Station in what is now Terrace Park. The area was surrounded by Shawnee settlements, and the Shawnee were hostile towards the white settlement in their midst. Covalt Station had to be abandoned in 1792 due to continuing attacks by the Shawnee, and white settlers only returned after the infamous General &quot; Mad Anthony &quot; Wayne won victory over the Shawnee and secured a treaty granting all of southern Ohio to the United States. Before roads and railroads connected the village to other nearby settlements, such as Milford, most residents of Terrace Park kept cattle and chickens, and engaged in other agricultural activities for their own subsistence, and had &quot; homesteads &quot; as opposed to the ordered residential village of today. { A Place called Terrace Park by Ellis Rawnsley &apos;&apos;Terrace Park Historical Society, 1992&apos;&apos; } Terrace Park was incorporated in 1893, and was the winter residence of the Robinson Circus until 1916. During the time that the circus wintered in Terrace Park, it was not unusual for elephants to roam free about the village, until the village council asked that they be restrained in 1910.
