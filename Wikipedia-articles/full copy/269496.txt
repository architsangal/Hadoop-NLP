[ the type of pillar found in the Marianas Islands Latte stone ] [ Caffèllatte_as_being_served_at_Kaffebrenneriet_Torshov,_Oslo,_Norway_2_600x600_100KB.jpg ] A latte (from the Italian caffè latte or caffellatte [ ˌkaffelˈlatte pron ], meaning &quot; coffee [and] milk &quot; ) is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk or soy milk. Variants include replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai, mate or matcha. When used in English, the word is also sometimes spelled latté or lattè—the diacritical mark being added as a hyperforeignism. [ Origin ] { Latte Art } In Italian latte ( [ ˈ l ɑː t eɪ ]; [ ˈlatte ] ) means milk — so ordering a &quot; latte &quot; in Italy will get the customer a glass of milk.

[ Spelling variations ] Coffee menus worldwide use a number of spelling variations for words to indicate coffee and milk, often using incorrect accents or a combination of French and Italian terms. Italian is caffe(l)latte (the extra l usually added by Southern Italians), contracted from caffè-latte, (with a grave accent over the e), while French is café au lait (with an acute accent ); Spanish is café con leche and Portuguese is café com leite. Variants such as caffé latte, café latte, and caffé lattè are commonly seen in English. [ Current use ] In Italy, caffelatte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. The coffee is brewed with a stovetop Moka pot and poured into a cup containing heated milk. (Unlike the international latte drink, the milk in the Italian original is not foamed.) Outside Italy, a caffè latte is typically prepared in a 240  mL (8  oz) glass or cup with one standard shot of espresso (either single, 30  mL, or double, 60  mL) and filled with steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk approximately 12  mm (½ inch) thick on the top. A caffè latte may also be served consisting of strong or bold coffee (sometimes espresso) mixed with scalded milk in approximately a 1:1 ratio. { &quot; Coffee Variations Dictionary &quot; (Dutch) composed by the Dutch coffee branche Douwe Egberts } [ November 2011 ] The drink is similar to a cappuccino, the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and steamed milk with a 20  mm (¾ inch) layer of thick milk foam. An Australian/New Zealand variant similar to the latte is the flat white, which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with the micro-foamed milk. In the United States this beverage is sometimes referred to as a wet cappuccino. [ Caffè latte vs. latte macchiato ] [ Latte macchiato ] A glass of Latte Macchiato A caffè latte differs from a latte macchiato in that in a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than the reverse. A caffè latte has a stronger coffee flavor. The latte macchiato is milk steamed to microfoam, served in a glass with a half shot of espresso poured gently through the foamy top layer, creating a layered drink with a macchia – a spot – of espresso on the top. As with an espresso macchiato, which is espresso with a spot of milk atop, indicating there&apos;s a hint of milk underneath the espresso foam, a latte macchiato is the opposite, to indicate there is espresso in the milk. The use of the term &apos;macchiato&apos; has been widened to include a huge array of beverages and ice creams. In some countries (like Germany), latte macchiato is the preferred term. Although the term machiatto has been used to describe various types of espresso drinks, a true machiatto is 3/4 espresso and 1/4 steamed milk. A true machiatto is about 4 ounces and is usually served in a demi tasse. Although a traditional machiatto is small, there are still ways to pour art into the crema of drink. the only difference between pouring latte art and machiatto art is that for a machiatto, the milk has to be poured faster and through a much smaller stream. Certain companies such as Starbucks sell drinks under the name machiatto although they are not traditional machiattos. A true machiatto can usually be found at independent coffee shops. [ Serving styles ] [ Leroux Charles The bootleg latte: Would you make one? Chicago Tribune 5 October 2006 http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/dining/chi-bootleg-latte%2C0%2C5331883.story 2008-07-18 ] In some establishments, lattes are served in a glass on a saucer with a napkin to hold the (sometimes hot) glass. A latte is sometimes served in a bowl; in Europe, particularly Scandinavia, this is referred to as a cafe au lait. Increasingly common in the United States and Europe, latte art has led to the stylization of coffee making, and the creation of what is now a popular art form. Created by pouring steaming, and mostly frothed, milk into the coffee, that liquid is introduced into the beverage in such a way, patterns are distinguishable on the top of coffee. Popular patterns can include hearts, flowers, trees and other forms of simplistic representations of images and objects. Iced latte is often served unstirred so that coffee appears to &quot; float &quot; on top of white milk in a glass cup. The relatively high prices demanded by some establishments have led to the creation of ghetto latte or bootleg lattes, whereby customers mix their own latte by ordering a lower-priced cup of espresso and then mixing it with milk and other condiments offered for free at the condiments bar. In Asia and North America, lattes have been combined with Asian teas. Coffee and tea shops now offer hot or iced latte versions of chai, matcha, and Royal milk tea. Other flavorings can be added to the latte to suit the taste of the drinker. Vanilla, chocolate, and caramel are all popular variants. In South Africa a red latte is made with rooibos tea.
