The character first appeared in Fantastic Four #66 (Sept. 1967) (in cocoon form) and #67 (Oct. 1967) (in humanoid form), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Debuting in the Silver Age of comic books, the character has appeared in over four decades of Marvel publications, and starred in the popular titles Marvel Premiere and Strange Tales; five self-titled volumes and several related limited series. Adam Warlock has also been associated with Marvel merchandise including clothing; toy s; trading cards; animated television series and video game s. He is sometimes referred as the &quot; Gold-skinned Gladiator &quot; { Adam Warlock #1 (1972) } and &quot; the Golden Gladiator &quot;. { Adam Warlock #5 (1973) } { Adam Warlock #6 (1973) } [ Publication history ] [ 1960s to 1970s ] The character debuted in Fantastic Four #66-67 (Sept.-Oct. 1967) in a story written by Stan Lee and pencilled and co-plotted by Jack Kirby. After a second appearance as &quot; Him &quot; in Thor #165-166 (June–July 1969), writer and then Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas and penciler Gil Kane significantly revamped Him as the allegorical Messiah Adam Warlock in Marvel Premiere #1 (April 1972). In 2009, Thomas explained he had been a fan of the soundtrack to the musical Jesus Christ Superstar and sought to bring the story to comic books in a superhero context: &quot; Yes, I had some trepidation about the Christ parallels, but I hoped there would be little outcry if I handled it tastefully, since I was not really making any serious statement on religion... at least not overtly. &quot; { Walker, Karen. &quot; The Life and Death (and Life and Death) of Adam Warlock &quot;, Back Issue #34 (June 2009), p.3 } Choosing to use a preexisting character while keeping the series locale separate from mainstream Marvel Earth, he created Counter-Earth, a new planet generated from a chunk of Earth and set in orbit on the opposite side of the sun. { Walker, p.4 } Thomas and Kane collaborated on the costume, with the red tunic and golden lightning bolt as their homage to Fawcett Comics &apos; 1940s-1950s character Captain Marvel. The story continued in the series The Power of Warlock, which ran eight issues (Aug. 1972 - Oct. 1973), with some plotlines concluded in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2, #158 (Dec. 1972). In a 2009 retrospective survey of the character, writer Karen Walker said the series [... continued the story of Adam&apos;s attempts to drive the [fallen-angel figure the] Man-Beast out of Counter-Earth, but drifted toward standard superhero stories with pseudo- Biblical references injected into them. Warlock spends much of his time trying to convince the High Evolutionary not to destroy the planet, and the rest of his time battling the Man-Beast and his minions. Although the concept of a superhero savior was still present, it often came across as forced, and certainly contradictory to the idea of a pacifistic savior. It&apos;s questionable whether the concept could really work in a medium driven by physical conflict. Walker, p.5 ] { Marvel Premiere &apos;&apos; #1 (April 1972). Debut of Him as Adam Warlock. Cover art by } { Gil Kane &amp; } { Dan Adkins. } Writer-artist Jim Starlin revived Warlock in Strange Tales #178-181 (Feb.-Aug. 1975). Warlock&apos;s adventures became more cosmic in scope as Starlin took the character through an extended storyline referred to as &quot; The Magus Saga. &quot; { Kingman, Jim. &quot; Comic Effect &quot; (column): &quot; The Magus Saga &quot;, Comics Bulletin, September 16, 2004. archive. } The reimagined title continued the numbering of The Power of Warlock and began with Warlock #9 (Oct. 1975) and ran seven issues. The bimonthly series was initially written and drawn by Starlin, but was eventually co-penciled and inked by Steve Leialoha. Some plot threads were concluded in Marvel Team-Up #55 (March 1977), Avengers Annual #7 (November 1977) and Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (December 1977) Starlin, in a 2009 interview, recalled, [ &quot; I had quit [the cosmic superhero series] Captain Marvel over a dispute at that point, but I settled the dispute with Marvel and I was going to come back [to that title]. But [a different team was in place]. So Roy [Thomas] asked me [what character] I wanted to do. So I went home that night and pulled out a bunch of comics. I came across, in the Fantastic Four, Him, and came back the next day and said that&apos;s who I wanted to do, and that night I started working on it... I had basically taken Captain Marvel, a warrior, and turned him into sort of a messiah-type character. So when I got to Warlock, I said to myself, &apos;I got a messiah right here to start off with; where do I go from there?&apos; And I decided a paranoid schizophrenic was the route to take. &quot; Walker, p.6 ] Warlock&apos;s adventures were reprinted, with new Starlin covers, in the six-issue limited series Special Edition on Warlock (Dec. 1982 - May 1983). { &apos;&apos;Special Edition on Warlock&apos;&apos; (1982-1983) at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators.

[ 1990s revival ] Eleven years later, Starlin revived the character and two members of his supporting cast in the miniseries Infinity Gauntlet #1-6 (July-Dec. 1991). This plot development was a continuation of a larger storyline that began with the resurrection of Thanos in Silver Surfer vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990). Following the events of the The Infinity Gauntlet (July-Dec. 1991), Warlock and several compatriots starred in the series Warlock and the Infinity Watch. Initially written by Starlin and drawn by Angel Medina, it ran 42 issues (Feb. 1992 - Aug. 1995). Its plots tied directly into the limited series Infinity War (June-Nov. 1992) and Infinity Crusade (June-Dec. 1993). Warlock starred in several limited series, including Silver Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection #1-4 (March–June 1993); The Warlock Chronicles #1-8 (July 1993 - Feb. 1994); and Warlock vol. 3, #1-4 (Nov. 1998 - Feb. 1999), by writer-penciler Tom Lyle. { &apos;&apos;Warlock&apos;&apos; (III) (1998-1999) at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators } The character was also featured in the intercompany crossover s between Marvel Comics and the Malibu Comics &quot; Ultraverse &quot; in the one-shot Rune / Silver Surfer (April 1995 in indicia, June 1995 on cover); Rune vol. 2, #1-7 (Sept. 1995 - April 1996), and the two-issue Ultraverse Unlimited (June &amp; Sept. 1996). Following the unrelated, 1999-2000 series Warlock vol. 4, featuring the alien cybernetic character Warlock of the team the New Mutants, { &apos;&apos;Warlock&apos;&apos;(IV) (Mutant Alien) (1999-2000) at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators } Adam Warlock co-starred with Thanos in the limited series The Infinity Abyss #1-6 (Aug.-Oct. 2002; published biweekly); Marvel Universe: The End #1-6 (May-Aug. 2003; first four issues biweekly); and Thanos #1-6 (Dec. 2003 - April 2004; two issues biweekly). A version of the character starred in the four-issue limited series Warlock vol. 5 (Nov. 2004 - Feb. 2005), by writer Greg Pak and artist Charles Adlard. After appearances in Annihilation Conquest: Quasar #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007) and Annihilation Conquest # 1-6 (Nov. 2007 - April 2008), he was a key character in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #1-25 (July 2008 - April 2010), The Thanos Imperative #1 (June 2010) and the Ignition one-shot (May 2010) Artist Alan Weiss recalled in a 2006 interview there was a &quot; lost &quot; Adam Warlock story, which if completed would have been reminiscent of the Jonathan Swift novel Gulliver&apos;s Travels. { Best, Daniel &quot; The Legendary &apos;Lost&apos; Warlock &quot; Adelaide Comics and Books, 2007 } Portions of it were printed in the second volume of Marvel Masterworks : Warlock.

The &quot; moral &quot; aspects of his persona in turn take on physical forms — the evil half becomes a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half becomes the self-styled Goddess. Warlock, aided by an army of superheroes, eventually defeats each in turn, and absorbs them into the Soul Gem. { The Infinity War #1-6 (June-Nov. 1992) } { The Infinity Crusade #1-6 (June-Dec. 1993) } The Watch then battles to protect the soul gem from Count Abyss, a powerful entity who has no soul of his own.

However, Him sacrificed the majority of these powers by prematurely emerging from his cocoon in order to defend the High Evolutionary from an assault by the Man-Beast. In compensation, the High Evolutionary gave Him the Soul Gem. { Marvel Premiere #1 (April 1972) } The Gem possesses a consciousness of its own and demonstrates a vampiric hunger for the life energies of organic beings. It also contains an idyllic pocket universe that hosts all the souls the Gem has ever taken. The latest version of Warlock uses &quot; Quantum magic &quot; and can manipulate energy; create force fields; teleport; travel faster than light and detect wormholes and other irregularities in space.
