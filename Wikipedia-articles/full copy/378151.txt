The Keeper or Master of the Rolls and Records of the Chancery of England, known as the Master of the Rolls, is the second most senior judge in England and Wales, after the Lord Chief Justice. The Master of the Rolls is the presiding officer of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal. The first record of a Master of the Rolls is from 1286, although it is believed that the office probably existed earlier than that. { Sainty (1993) p. 144 } The Master of the Rolls was initially a clerk responsible for keeping the &quot; Rolls &quot;, or records, of the Chancery court, and was known as the Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery. { Hanworth (1935) p. 310 } The Keeper was the most senior of the dozen Chancery clerks, and as such occasionally acted as keeper of the Great Seal of the Realm. { Hanworth (1935) p. 316 } The post evolved into a judicial one as the Court of Chancery did; the first reference to judicial duties dates from 1520. { Hanworth (1935) p. 327 } With the Judicature Act 1873, the Master transferred from the now-defunct Court of Chancery to the Court of Appeal. [ http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/theme/92826 Oxford DNB theme:Masters of the Rolls Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Oxford University Press 13 October 2008 ] The Master still retained his clerical functions by serving as the nominal head of the Public Record Office (PRO) until 1958. However, the Public Records Act of that year transferred responsibility for the PRO from the Master of the Rolls to the Lord Chancellor. The Master of the Rolls is also responsible for registering solicitors, the officers of the Senior Courts.
