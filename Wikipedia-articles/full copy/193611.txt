Arthur Rank &apos;s &apos;well-spoken young starlets&apos; – followed mainly by Hollywood films from 1950. [ Jean Simmons, Actress, Dies at 80 Aljean Harmetz January 23, 2010 Jean Simmons, the English actress who made the covers of Time and Life magazines by the time she was 20 and became a major mid-century star alongside strong leading men like Laurence Olivier, Richard Burton and Marlon Brando, often playing their demure helpmates, died on Friday at her home in Santa Monica, California. She was 80. The cause was lung cancer, according to Judy Page, her agent.... The New York Times http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/movies/24simmons.html January 24, 2010 ] [ Early life and career ] Simmons was born in Lower Holloway, London, England, to Charles Simmons and his wife, Winifred (Loveland) Simmons. Jean was the youngest of four children with siblings Edna, Harold and Lorna. She began acting at the age of 14. During the war, the Simmons family was evacuated to Winscombe in Somerset. { Picturegoer 2 August 1947 &apos;Are They Being Fair To Jean Simmons?&apos; } Her father, a physical education teacher (who had represented Great Britain in the 1912 Summer Olympics ), { as told to } { Gloria Hunniford in Sunday, Sunday television interview LWT, autumn 1985 } taught briefly at Sidcot School, and sometime during this period Simmons followed her elder sister on to the village stage and sang songs such as &quot; Daddy Wouldn&apos;t Buy Me a Bow Wow &quot;. Returning to London and just enrolled at the Aida Foster School of Dance, she was spotted by the director Val Guest, who cast her in the Margaret Lockwood vehicle Give Us the Moon. { Val Guest So You Want to be in Pictures? p.58.ISBN 1-90311-115-3 } Small roles in several other films followed including the high profile Caesar and Cleopatra, produced by Gabriel Pascal. Pascal saw potential in Simmons and in 1945 he signed her to a seven year contract. { Jean Simmons, The Biography Channel } Prior to moving to Hollywood, she played the young Estella in David Lean &apos;s version of Great Expectations (1946) and Ophelia in Laurence Olivier &apos;s Hamlet (1948), for which she received her first Oscar nomination. It was the experience of working on Great Expectations that caused her to pursue an acting career more seriously: [ I thought acting was just a lark, meeting all those exciting movie stars, and getting £5 a day which was lovely because we needed the money. But I figured I&apos;d just go off and get married and have children like my mother. It was working with David Lean that convinced me to go on. Woman&apos;s Weekly, Christmas 1989 ] Playing Ophelia in Olivier&apos;s Hamlet made her a star, although she was already well known for her work in other British films, including her first starring role in the film adaptation of Uncle Silas, and Black Narcissus (both 1947). Olivier offered her the chance to work and study at the Bristol Old Vic, advising her to play anything they threw at her to get experience; she was under contract to the Rank Organisation who vetoed the idea. { Philip French &quot; Jean Simmons: an unforgettable English rose &quot;, The Observer, 24 January 2010 (print edition) } Rank was unhappy at this time also that Stewart Granger was pursuing his young star and, (according to the actor&apos;s account), confronted Granger ( &quot; a shop-worn thirty-four &quot; ), at a meeting at the Dorchester Hotel saying that what was going on was wrong since he was a married man with two children. Granger told Rank he had been divorced for six months, and left. { Stewart Granger, Sparks Fly Upward, Granada 1981, p.132 } In 1949 Simmons starred with Granger in Adam and Evelyne. In 1950 Rank sold Simmons&apos;s contract to Howard Hughes, who then owned the RKO studio in Hollywood. That year she was voted the fourth most popular star in Britain. [ http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18193224 Critics Praise Drama: Comedians Win Profits. The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954) NSW 29 December 1950 24 April 2012 3 National Library of Australia ] In 1950 she married the English actor Stewart Granger, with whom she appeared in several films, successfully making the transition to an American career. She made four films for Hughes, including Angel Face, directed by Otto Preminger. According to David Thomson &quot; if she had made only one film – Angel Face – she might now be spoken of with the awe given to Louise Brooks. &quot; { David Thomson Obituary: Jean Simmons, The Guardian, 25 January 2010 } A court case freed her from the contract with Hughes in 1952. In 1953 she starred alongside Spencer Tracy in The Actress, a film that was one of her personal favourites. Among the many films she appeared in during this period were The Robe (1953), Young Bess (1953), Désirée (1954), The Egyptian (1954), Guys and Dolls (1955) – &quot; in which she&apos;s delightfully proper (and improper) as the Salvation Army officer Sarah Brown &quot; { Philip French, Screen Legends, No.11 } – The Big Country (1958), Elmer Gantry (1960), (directed by her second husband, Richard Brooks ), Spartacus (1960), All the Way Home (1963) – a film of James Agee &apos;s novel, A Death in the Family – and The Happy Ending (1969), again directed by Brooks and for which she received her second Oscar nomination. In the opinion of film critic Philip French, a film of 1958, Home Before Dark, saw her give &quot; perhaps her finest performance as a housewife driven into a breakdown in Mervyn LeRoy &apos;s psychodrama. &quot; { Philip French, Screen Legends, The Observer, 6 April 2008 } By the 1970s Simmons turned her focus to stage and television acting. She toured the United States in Stephen Sondheim &apos;s well-reviewed musical A Little Night Music, then took the show to London, and thus originated the role of Desirée Armfeldt on the West End. { Sondheim Guide - A Little Night Music } Doing the show for three years, she said she never tired of Sondheim&apos;s music; &quot; No matter how tired or off you felt, the music would just pick you up. &quot; She portrayed Fiona Cleary, Cleary family matriarch, in the 1983 mini-series, The Thorn Birds; she won an Emmy Award for her role. In 1985 and 1986 she appeared in North &amp; South, again playing the role of the family matriarch as Clarissa Main. In 1988 she starred in The Dawning with Anthony Hopkins and Hugh Grant, and in 1989 she again starred in a mini-series, this time a version of Great Expectations, in which she played the role of Miss Havisham, Estella&apos;s adoptive mother. Simmons made a late career appearance in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode &quot; The Drumhead &quot; as a hardened legal investigator who conducts a witch-hunt. In 1991 she appeared in the short-lived revival of the 1960s daytime series &apos;&apos;Dark Shadows&apos;&apos;, in roles originally played by Joan Bennett. From 1994 until 1998 Simmons narrated the A &amp; E documentary television series, Mysteries of the Bible. In 2004 Simmons voiced the lead-role of Sophie in the English dub of Howl&apos;s Moving Castle. [ Personal life ] Jean Simmons was married and divorced twice. She married Stewart Granger in Tucson, Arizona, on 20 December, 1950. In 1956 she and Granger became U.S. citizens; they divorced in 1960. On 1 November, 1960, she married director Richard Brooks; they divorced in 1977. Although both men were significantly older than Simmons, she denied she was looking for a father figure. Her father had died when she was just 16 but she said: &quot; They were really nothing like my father at all. My father was a gentle, soft-spoken man. My husbands were much noisier and much more opinionated... it&apos;s really nothing to do with age... it&apos;s to do with what&apos;s there – the twinkle and sense of humour. &quot; { &quot; Woman&apos;s Weekly Christmas 1989 &quot; } And in a 1984 interview, given in Copenhagen at the time she was shooting the film Yellow Pages, she elaborated slightly on her marriages, stating, [ It may be simplistic, but you could sum up my two marriages by saying that, when I wanted to be a wife, Jimmy [Stewart Granger] would say: &apos;I just want you to be pretty.&apos; And when I wanted to cook, Richard would say: &apos;Forget the cooking. You&apos;ve been trained to act – so act!&apos; Most people thought I was helpless – a clinger and a butterfly – during my first marriage. It was Richard Brooks who saw what was wrong and tried to make me stand on my own two feet. I&apos;d whine: &apos;I&apos;m afraid.&apos; And he&apos;d say: &apos;Never be afraid to fail. Every time you get up in the morning, you are ahead.&apos; ] She had two daughters, Tracy Granger and Kate Brooks, one by each marriage – their names bearing witness to Simmons&apos; friendship with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Simmons moved to the East Coast of the US in the late 1970s, briefly owning a home in New Milford, Connecticut near her longtime friend Rex Reed. Later she moved to Santa Monica, California, where she lived until her death from lung cancer. She died at home on 22 January, 2010, nine days before her 81st birthday, surrounded by her family.

She was an active supporter of their campaigns for just, humane and effective drug policies, recognising that many of those with drug problems cannot afford the luxurious facilities available to celebrities. In 2005 Simmons signed a petition to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair asking him not to upgrade cannabis from a class C drug to a class B.

[ October 2011 ] She was cremated in Santa Monica and her ashes buried in North London in Highgate Cemetery West.
