The population was 16,465 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Defiance County. [ 6 ] The city contains the site of Fort Defiance, built by General &quot; Mad &quot; Anthony Wayne in August 1794, during the Northwest Indian War, at the confluence of the Auglaize and Maumee rivers. General Wayne surveyed the land and declared to General Scott, &quot; I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils of hell to take it. &quot; This area became Fort Defiance. Today a pair of cannons outside the city library on the Maumee River overlook the confluence and mark the location of Fort Defiance, along with a mounded outline of the fort walls. From Fort Defiance, the American forces moved northeast along the Maumee River to fight the decisive Battle of Fallen Timbers near the current town of Maumee, Ohio. This victory secured for the United States the Northwest Territories, now the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. Fort Winchester was built on the same spot during the war of 1812, but it was a larger fort that extended southward somewhat along the Auglaize River. Historical plaques in the sidewalks mark the full extent of Fort Winchester. [ Geography ] Defiance is located at [ 41 16 55 N 84 21 46 W type:city ] (41.281891, -84.362856).
