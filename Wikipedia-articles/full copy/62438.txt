[ March 2011 ] [ yes 1952 1 12 ] { Arch Jelley } [ Men’s athletics ] [ Olympic Games ] [ 1976 Montreal 1500 metres ] [ 1982 Brisbane 1500 metres ] [ 1974 Christchurch 1500 metres ] [ 1974 Christchurch 800 metres ] { yes } Sir John George Walker, KNZM, CBE, (born 12 January 1952 in Papakura ) is a former middle distance runner from New Zealand. Walker was the first person to run the mile in under 3:50, and won the Olympic Games 1500m in Montreal in 1976. [ 1974 Commonwealth Games ] Walker achieved world prominence in 1974 when he ran second to Filbert Bayi in the 1500 meter run at the Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand. In one the greatest 1500 m races held to that time, Walker and Bayi both broke the existing world record, and others in the race recorded the fourth, fifth, and seventh fastest performances ever. Additionally, Walker won the bronze medal in the 800 metres in 1:44.92, his lifetime best for the distance, and still the second-fastest New Zealander ever, behind Peter Snell. Throughout his career as a world-class miler Walker was coached by Arch Jelley, a school principal, and a middle distance runner himself, whose work with runners has been typified by meticulous training programmes on a scientific basis and effective communications in person. [ World record breaking runs ] Walker broke the World Record in the mile run with a time of 3:49.4 minutes set at Göteborg, Sweden, on 12 August 1975, bettering the previous time of 3:51.0 set earlier that year by Filbert Bayi. It was the first time that the Three minutes and 50 seconds barrier had been broken, and it was a full 10 seconds faster than Roger Bannister &apos;s historic sub-Four-Minute Mile of 3:59.4 that was run twenty-one years previous. He was named Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News the same year. Walker&apos;s new record lasted until 17 July 1979, when it was lowered by the Briton Sebastian Coe. The following year Walker broke the world record for the 2000 metres, running 4:51.4 in Oslo, Norway, on 30 June 1976. He smashed the existing ten-year-old record held by Michel Jazy by nearly five seconds; Walker regarded this run as the best he ever ran. Steve Cram would not better Walker&apos;s record by running 4:51.4 at Budapest, Hungary until 4 August 1985. Indoors, Walker broke the 1500 metre world record with a time of 3:37.4 in 1979. [ 1976 Montreal Olympic Games ] In the 800 metres Walker failed to advance to the semi-finals missing the top two qualifying spots in his heat running a time of 1:47.63. However Walker was a favourite to win the 1500 metres due to the African boycott of the Games weakening the field. The 1500 metres final started at a slow pace going through 800 metres in 2:03. The race would come down to a fast finish. In a bid to out-sprint runners that were quicker over 800 metres, Walker started his finishing sprint 300 metres from the finish, fading in the last 20 metres holding out Ivo Van Damme and Paul-Heinz Wellmann to win the gold medal. { The New Zealand Olympic Committee website - John Walker Profile } Although it seemed that the boycott denied Bayi (who was Walker&apos;s main rival) the opportunity to challenge for the 1500 metre title, Bayi likely would not have competed, anyway, because of an attack of malaria that he suffered. Walker would justify his Olympic Gold over several record-breaking years. [ New Zealand records ] During 1981 he set a New Zealand all-comers&apos; mile record of 3:50.6 in Auckland. In 1982 in Oslo, Norway, Steve Scott (3:47.69), John Walker (3:49.08), and Ray Flynn (3:49.77) took the top three spots in The Dream Mile, establishing American, New Zealand, and Irish national records for the mile in the same race. All three national records stood for 25 years until 21 July 2007, when Alan Webb broke Scott&apos;s American record. Walker and Flynn&apos;s times remain national records. [ Running twilight ] At the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane he won the silver medal in the 1500 metres finishing behind Steve Cram. He moved up up to the 5000 metres distance for both the 1984 Olympic Games and the 1986 Commonwealth Games with limited success. He raced at the 1990 Commonwealth Games competing in both the 800 and 1500 metres, where he was tripped early on in the latter. Walker became the first man in history to run 100 sub- 4 minute mile s in 1985, achieving that feat just before fellow miler Steve Scott of the U.S. As his career wore on, leg injuries and stomach cramps started to affect his training. In the early 1990s he aimed to be the first runner aged over 40 to run a mile under four minutes, but his attempts failed due to a leg injury. At this point his international career had shown remarkable longevity - spanning almost two decades. Walker ended his racing career with an astonishing 135 sub-four-minute miles. He was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, and in 1996 the Olympic Committee awarded him with the Olympic Bronze Order. [ After running ] [ Independent (politician) Manurewa-Papakura 2010 2013 ] Also in 1996, Walker announced that he was suffering from Parkinson&apos;s disease. He now operates an equestrian shop in Newmarket in Auckland, New Zealand with his wife, Helen, and was a Manukau City Councillor, after which he became a councillor for the merged Auckland Council. [ July 2010 ] Walker and his wife have four children: Elizabeth, Richard, Timothy, and Caitlin. On 1 June 2009 in the Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours List, Walker was appointed Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit { http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/list.asp?id=45 2009 Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours List } [ Personal bests ] Distance Time Place Date 800 m 1:44.92 Christchurch 1974 1000 m 2:16.6 NR Oslo 1980 1500 m 3:32.4 Oslo 1975 Mile 3:49.08 NR Oslo 1982 2000 m 4:51.4 NR Oslo 1976 3000 m 7:37.49 NR London 1982 [ References ] [ External links ] Biography New Zealand Olympic Committee Page with Photo, one of two at &apos;&apos;Sporting Heroes&apos;&apos; IAAF Biography Video links Video Interview of John Walker talking about his Olympic Win [ rec ] [ TAN ] { Filbert Bayi } { Men&apos;s Mile World Record Holder } { 12 August 1975 — 17 July 1979 } [ GBR ] { Sebastian Coe } [ USA ] { Rick Wohlhuter } [ CUB ] { Alberto Juantorena } { 1975 } [ August 2010 ] [ Walker, John New Zealand distance runner 12 January 1952 ] Category:1952 births Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games bronze medallists for New Zealand Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for New Zealand Category:Former world record holders in athletics (track and field) Category:Knights Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:Sports players and officials awarded knighthoods Category:Living people Category:Auckland Councillors Category:New Zealand sportsperson–politicians Category:New Zealand athletes Category:New Zealand middle distance runners Category:New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame inductees Category:Olympic athletes of New Zealand Category:Olympic gold medalists for New Zealand Category:Olympic medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:World record holders in athletics (track and field) an:John Walker ca:John George Walker de:John Walker (Leichtathlet) es:John Walker eu:John Walker (atleta) fr:John Walker (athlète) it:John Walker (atleta) he:ג&apos;ון ווקר (אתלט) hu:John Walker nl:John Walker (atleet) ja:ジョン・ウォーカー (陸上選手) no:John Walker (friidrettsutøver) pl:John Walker (lekkoatleta) fi:John Walker
