It was their first album and contains the singles &quot; Flag Day &quot; (#58 in the UK), &quot; Sheep &quot; (#54 in the UK), &quot; Happy Hour &quot; (#3 in the UK) and &quot; Think for a Minute &quot; (#18 in the UK). The title refers to the band&apos;s home town of Kingston upon Hull and is in the format of a sports result. It also refers to Paul Heaton &apos;s assertion that the Housemartins were only the fourth best band in Hull. In other words, Hull had four great bands, compared to none from London. The liner notes and lyrics reflect singer Paul Heaton &apos;s interest at that time in Christianity and Marxism. For example, the back cover of the album contains the message, &quot; Take Jesus - Take Marx - Take Hope &quot;. In 1992, the album was re-released on CD and featured four additional tracks, along with the front cover phrase, &quot; 16 songs - 17 hits! &quot; The album was re-released again on 22 June 2009, as London 0 Hull 4 Deluxe, containing a second CD of bonus tracks, B-sides and live recordings.
