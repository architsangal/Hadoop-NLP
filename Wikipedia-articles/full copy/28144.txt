[ ] Seaborgium ( [ seaborgium.ogg s iː ˈ b ɔr ɡ i ə m ] [ see BOR gee-əm ] ) is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Sg and atomic number 106. Seaborgium is a synthetic element whose most stable isotope 271 Sg has a half-life of 1.9 minute s. A new isotope { 269 } Sg has a potentially slightly longer half-life (ca. 2.1 min) based on the observation of a single decay. [ January 2012 ] Chemistry experiments with seaborgium have firmly placed it in group 6 as a heavier homologue to tungsten. [ History ] [ Discovery ] Element 106, now known as seaborgium, was first created in 1974 at the Super HILAC accelerator at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory by a joint Lawrence Berkeley/Lawrence Livermore collaboration led by Albert Ghiorso and E. Kenneth Hulet. [ Element 106 Ghiorso, A., Nitschke, J. M., Alonso, J. R., Alonso, C. T., Nurmia, M., Seaborg, G. T., Hulet, E. K., Lougheed, R. W. Phys. Rev. Lett. 33 1490–1493 1974 10.1103/PhysRevLett.33.1490 1974PhRvL..33.1490G 25 ] They produced the new nuclide 263 Sg by bombarding a target of 249 Cf with 18 O ions. This nuclide decays by α emission with a half-life of 0.9 ± 0.2 sec. [ Naming ] [ Element naming controversy ] The Berkeley/Livermore collaboration suggested the name seaborgium (Sg) to honor the American chemist Glenn T. Seaborg credited as a member of the American group in recognition of his participation in the discovery of several other actinides. The name selected by the team became controversial. The IUPAC adopted unnilhexium (symbol Unh) as a temporary, systematic element name. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 106 be named rutherfordium and adopted a rule that no element can be named after a living person. [ 10.1351/pac199466122419 Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1994) 1994 Pure and Applied Chemistry 66 2419 12 ] This ruling was fiercely objected to by the American Chemical Society. Critics pointed out that a precedent had been set in the naming of einsteinium during Albert Einstein &apos;s life and a survey indicated that chemists were not concerned with the fact that Seaborg was still alive. In 1997, as part of a compromise involving elements 104 to 108, the name seaborgium for element 106 was recognized internationally. [ 10.1351/pac199769122471 Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1997) 1997 Pure and Applied Chemistry 69 2471 12 ] [ Chemical properties ] [ Extrapolated properties ] Oxidation states Seaborgium is projected to be the third member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the Periodic Table, below chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +6 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus seaborgium is expected to form a stable +6 state. For this group, stable +5 and +4 states are well represented for the heavier members and the +3 state is known but reducing, except for chromium(III). Chemistry Much seaborgium chemical behavior is predicted by extrapolation from its lighter congeners molybdenum and tungsten. Molybdenum and tungsten readily form stable trioxides MO 3, so seaborgium should form SgO 3. The oxides MO 3 are soluble in alkali with the formation of oxyanions, so seaborgium should form a seaborgate ion, SgO 4 2 &amp; minus;. In addition, WO 3 reacts with acid, suggesting similar amphotericity for SgO 3. Molybdenum oxide, MoO 3, also reacts with moisture to form a hydroxide MoO 2 (OH) 2, so SgO 2 (OH) 2 is also feasible. The heavier homologues readily form the volatile, reactive hexahalides MX 6 (X=Cl,F). Only tungsten forms the unstable hexabromide, WBr 6. Therefore, the compounds SgF 6 and SgCl 6 are predicted, and &quot; eka-tungsten character &quot; may show itself in increased stability of the hexabromide, SgBr 6. These halides are unstable to oxygen and moisture and readily form volatile oxyhalides, MOX 4 and MO 2 X 2. Therefore SgOX 4 (X=F,Cl) and SgO 2 X 2 (X=F,Cl) should be possible. In aqueous solution, a variety of anionic oxyfluoro-complexes are formed with fluoride ion, examples being MOF 5 &amp; minus; and MO 3 F 3 3 &amp; minus;. Similar seaborgium complexes are expected. [ Experimental chemistry ] [ Gas phase ] Initial experiments aiming at probing the chemistry of seaborgium focused on the gas thermochromatography of a volatile oxychloride. Seaborgium atoms were produced in the reaction 248 Cm( 22 Ne,4n) 266 Sg, thermalised, and reacted with an O 2 /HCl mixture. The adsorption properties of the resulting oxychloride were measured and compared with those of molybdenum and tungsten compounds. The results indicated that seaborgium formed a volatile oxychloride akin to those of the other group 6 elements: [ O 2 ] [ SgO 2 Cl 2 ] [ H 2 ] Sg + + 2 HCl → + In 2001, a team continued the study of the gas phase chemistry of seaborgium by reacting the element with O 2 in a H 2 O environment. In a manner similar to the formation of the oxychloride, the results of the experiment indicated the formation of seaborgium oxide hydroxide, a reaction well known among the lighter group 6 homologues.

Seaborgium was eluted from cation exchange resin using a HNO 3 /HF solution, most likely as neutral SgO 2 F 2 or the anionic complex ion [SgO 2 F 3 ] &amp; minus;. In contrast, in 0.1 M HNO 3, seaborgium does not elute, unlike Mo and W, indicating that the hydrolysis of [Sg(H 2 O) 6 ] 6+ only proceeds as far as the cationic complex [Sg(OH) 5 (H 2 O)] +.

These are processes which create compound nuclei at low excitation energy (~10-20 MeV, hence &quot; cold &quot; ), leading to a higher probability of survival from fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of one or two neutrons only. 208 Pb( 54 Cr,xn) 262-x Sg (x=1,2,3) The first attempt to synthesise seaborgium in cold fusion reactions was performed in September 1974 by a Soviet team led by G. N. Flerov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna. They reported producing a 0.48 s spontaneous fission (SF) activity which they assigned to the isotope 259 Sg. Based on later evidence it was suggested that the team most likely measured the decay of 260 Sg and its daughter 256 Rf. The TWG concluded that, at the time, the results were insufficiently convincing. [ 10.1351/pac199365081757 Discovery of the transfermium elements. Part II: Introduction to discovery profiles.

H. 8 ] The Dubna team revisited this problem in 1983-1984 and were able to detect a 5 ms SF activity assigned directly to 260 Sg. The team at GSI studied this reaction for the first time in 1985 using the improved method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays. They were able to detect 261 Sg (x=1) and 260 Sg and measured a partial 1n neutron evaporation excitation function. [ The isotopes 259 106, 260 106, and 261 106 10.1007/BF01411887 1985 Münzenberg, G.

H. 1985ZPhyA.322..227M 2 ] In December 2000, the reaction was studied by a team at GANIL, France and were able to detect 10 atoms of 261 Sg and 2 atoms of 260 Sg to add to previous data on the reaction. After a facility upgrade, the GSI team measured the 1n excitation function in 2003 using a metallic lead target. Of significance, in May 2003, the team successfully replaced the lead-208 target with more resistant lead(II) sulfide targets (PbS) which will allow more intense beams to be used in the future. They were able to measure the 1n,2n and 3n excitation functions and performed the first detailed alpha-gamma spectroscopy on the isotope 261 Sg. They detected ~1600 atoms of the isotope and identified new alpha lines as well as measuring a more accurate half-life and new EC and SF branchings. Furthermore, they were able to detect the K X-rays from the daughter rutherfordium element for the first time. They were also able to provide improved data for 260 Sg, including the tentative observation of an isomeric level. The study was continued in September 2005 and March 2006. The accumulated work on 261 Sg was published in 2007. [ Alpha-Gamma Decay Studies of 261 Sg Streicher et al. Acta Physica Polonica B 38 4 1561 2007 2007AcPPB..38.1561S Antalic S. Aro S. S. Venhart M. Hessberger F. P. Hofmann S. Ackermann D. Kindler B. Kojouharov I. ] Work in September 2005 also aimed to begin spectroscopic studies on 260 Sg. The team at the LBNL recently restudied this reaction in an effort to look at the spectroscopy of the isotope 261 Sg. They were able to detect a new isomer, 261m Sg, decaying by internal conversion into the ground state. In the same experiment, they were also able to confirm a K-isomer in the daughter 257 Rf, namely 257m2 Rf.

Allmond J. Bleuel D. Cromaz M. Dragojević I. Dvorak J. Ellison P. ] 207 Pb( 54 Cr,xn) 261-x Sg (x=1,2) The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1974 with identical results as for their first experiments with a Pb-208 target. The SF activities were first assigned to 259 Sg and later to 260 Sg and/or 256 Rf. Further work in 1983-1984 also detected a 5 ms SF activity assigned to the parent 260 Sg. The GSI team studied this reaction for the first time in 1985 using the method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays. They were able to positively identify 259 Sg as a product from the 2n neutron evaporation channel. The reaction was further used in March 2005 using PbS targets to begin a spectroscopic study of the even-even isotope 260 Sg. 206 Pb( 54 Cr,xn) 260-x Sg This reaction was studied in 1974 by the team at Dubna. It was used to assist them in their assignment of the observed SF activities in reactions using Pb-207 and Pb-208 targets. They were unable to detect any SF, indicating the formation of isotopes decaying primarily by alpha decay. 208 Pb( 52 Cr,xn) 260-x Sg (x=1,2) The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in their series of cold fusion reactions performed in 1974. Once again they were unable to detect any SF activities. The reaction was revisited in 2006 by the team at LBNL as part of their studies on the effect of the isospin of the projectile and hence the mass number of the compound nucleus on the yield of evaporation residues. They were able to identify 259 Sg and 258 Sg in their measurement of the 1n excitation function. { &quot; Measurement of the &lt; sup &gt; 208 &lt; /sup &gt; Pb( &lt; sup &gt; 52 &lt; /sup &gt; Cr,n) &lt; sup &gt; 259 &lt; /sup &gt; Sg Excitation Function &quot;, Folden et al., LBNL Annual Report 2005.

Once again they were unable to detect any SF activities. In 1994, the synthesis of seaborgium was revisited using this reaction by the GSI team, in order to study the new even-even isotope 258 Sg. Ten atoms of 258 Sg were detected and decayed by spontaneous fission. [ Hot fusion experiments ] This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of seaborgium by so-called &quot; hot &quot; fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40-50 MeV, hence &quot; hot &quot; ), leading to a reduced probability of survival from fission and quasi-fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of 3-5 neutrons. 238 U( 30 Si,xn) 268-x Sg (x=3,4,5,6) This reaction was first studied by Japanese scientists at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) in 1998. They detected a spontaneous fission activity which they tentatively assigned to the new isotope 264 Sg or 263 Db, formed by EC of 263 Sg.

The LBNL team measured an excitation function for the 4n,5n and 6n channels, whilst the GSI team were able to observe an additional 3n activity. { &quot; Production of seaborgium isotopes in the reaction of &lt; sup &gt; 30 &lt; /sup &gt; Si + &lt; sup &gt; 238 &lt; /sup &gt; U &quot;, Nishio et al., GSI Annual Report 2006.

[ 10.1103/PhysRevLett.73.624 Discovery of Enhanced Nuclear Stability near the Deformed Shells N=162 and Z=108 1994 Lazarev, Yu. A.

In the recent synthesis of 270 Hs (see hassium ), 266 Sg was found to undergo exclusively SF with a short half-life (T SF = 360 ms). It is possible that this is the ground state, ( 266g Sg) and that the other activity, produced directly, belongs to a high spin K-isomer, 266m Sg, but further results are required to confirm this. A recent re-evaluation of the decay characteristics of 265 Sg and 266 Sg has suggested that all decays to date in this reaction were in fact from 265 Sg, which exists in two isomeric forms. The first, 265a Sg has a principal alpha-line at 8.85 MeV and a calculated half-life of 8.9 s, whilst 265b Sg has a decay energy of 8.70 MeV and a half-life of 16.2 s. Both isomeric levels are populated when produced directly. Data from the decay of 269 Hs indicates that 265b Sg is produced during the decay of 269 Hs and that 265b Sg decays into the shorter-lived 261g Rf isotope. This means that the observation of 266 Sg as a long-lived alpha emitter is retracted and that it does indeed undergo fission in a short time. Regardless of these assignments, the reaction has been successfully used in the recent attempts to study the chemistry of seaborgium (see below). 249 Cf( 18 O,xn) 267-x Sg (x=4) The synthesis of seaborgium was first realized in 1974 by the LBNL/LLNL team. In their discovery experiment, they were able to apply the new method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays to identify the new isotope 263 Sg. In 1975, the team at Oak Ridge were able to confirm the decay data but were unable to identify coincident X-rays in order to prove that seaborgium was produced. In 1979, the team at Dubna studied the reaction by detection of SF activities. In comparison with data from Berkeley, they calculated a 70% SF branching for 263 Sg. The original synthesis and discovery reaction was confirmed in 1994 by a different team at LBNL. [ 10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.1423 First confirmation of the discovery of element 106 1994 Gregorich, K. E.

The longest-lived is currently 269 Sg which decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission, with a half-life of around 2.1 minutes. The shortest-lived isotope is 258 Sg which also decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission. It has a half-life of 2.9 ms. [ Nuclear isomerism ] 266 Sg Initial work identified an 8.63 MeV alpha-decaying activity with a half-life of ~21s and assigned to the ground state of 266 Sg. Later work identified a nuclide decaying by 8.52 and 8.77 MeV alpha emission with a half-life of ~21s, which is unusual for an even-even nuclide. Recent work on the synthesis of 270 Hs identified 266 Sg decaying by SF with a short 360 ms half-life. The recent work on 277 Cn and 269 Hs has provided new information on the decay of 265 Sg and 261 Rf. This work suggested that the initial 8.77 MeV activity should be reassigned to 265 Sg. Therefore the current information suggests that the SF activity is the ground state and the 8.52 MeV activity is a high spin K-isomer. Further work is required to confirm these assignments. A recent re-evaluation of the data has suggested that the 8.52 MeV activity should be associated with 265 Sg and that 266 Sg only undergoes fission. 265 Sg The recent direct synthesis of 265 Sg resulted in four alpha-lines at 8.94,8.84,8.76 and 8.69 MeV with a half-life of 7.4 seconds. The observation of the decay of 265 Sg from the decay of 277 Cn and 269 Hs indicated that the 8.69 MeV line may be associated with an isomeric level with an associated half-life of ~ 20 s. It is plausible that this level is causing confusion between assignments of 266 Sg and 265 Sg since both can decay to fissioning rutherfordium isotopes. A recent re-evaluation of the data has indicated that there are indeed two isomers, one with a principal decay energy of 8.85 MeV with a half-life of 8.9 s, and a second isomer which decays with energy 8.70 MeV with a half-life of 16.2 s. 263 Sg The discovery synthesis of 263 Sg resulted in an alpha-line at 9.06 MeV. Observation of this nuclide by decay of 271g Ds, 271m Ds and 267 Hs has confirmed an isomer decaying by 9.25 MeV alpha emission. The 9.06 MeV decay was also confirmed. The 9.06 MeV activity has been assigned to the ground state isomer with an associated half-life of 0.3 s. The 9.25 MeV activity has been assigned to an isomeric level decaying with a half-life of 0.9 s. Recent work on the synthesis of 271g,m Ds was resulted in some confusing data regarding the decay of 267 Hs. In one such decay, 267 Hs decayed to 263 Sg which decayed by alpha emission with a half-life of ~ 6 s. This activity has not yet been positively assigned to an isomer and further research is required. Spectroscopic decay schemes for 261 Sg This is the currently accepted decay scheme for 261 Sg from the study by Streicher et al. at GSI in 2003-2006 [ Retracted isotopes ] 269 Sg In the claimed synthesis of 293 Uuo in 1999 the isotope 269 Sg was identified as a daughter product. It decayed by 8.74 MeV alpha emission with a half-life of 22 s. The claim was retracted in 2001. { see } { ununoctium } This isotope was finally created in 2010.
