[ 15 ] { genera, &gt; 100 species } { Families } { * } { Geralinuridae * } { Thelyphonidae } Thelyphonida is an arachnid order comprising invertebrates commonly known as vinegaroons (or vinegarroons). They are often called uropygids in the scientific community after the former order Uropygi (which originally also included the order Schizomida ). They are also known as whip scorpions because of their resemblance to true scorpion s and because of their whiplike tails. [ Physical description ] { Thelyphonus doriae hosei&apos;&apos; } The name &quot; uropygid &quot; means &quot; tail rump &quot;, from Greek [ el οὐροπύγιον ] ( [ el ouropugion ] ), { Found in Aristoteles&apos; work: De Anim. Hist., Lib: IV Cap: I. } from [ el οὐρά ] ( [ el oura ] ) &quot; tail &quot; and [ el πυγή ] ( [ el puge ] ) &quot; rump &quot; referring to the whip-like flagellum on the end of the pygidium, a small plate made up of the last three segments of the abdominal exoskeleton. Vinegarroons range from [ 25 to 85 mm on ] in length, with most species not longer than [ 30 mm on ]; the largest species, of the genus Mastigoproctus, reaching [ 85 mm on ]. [ Günther Schmidt 1993 Giftige und gefährliche Spinnentiere German Poisonous and dangerous arachnids Westarp Wissenschaften 3-89432-405-8 ] Like the related orders Schizomida, Amblypygi, and Solifugae, the vinegarroons use only six legs for walking, having modified their first two legs to serve as antennae-like sensory organs. Many species also have very large scorpion -like pedipalp s (pincers). They have one pair of eyes at the front of the cephalothorax and three on each side of the head, a pattern also found in scorpions. Vinegarroons have no venom glands, but they have glands near the rear of their abdomen that can spray a combination of acetic acid and octanoic acid when they are bothered. The acetic acid gives this spray a vinegar-like smell, giving rise to the common name vinegarroon. Vinegarroons are carnivorous, nocturnal hunters feeding mostly on insect s and millipede s, but sometimes on worms and slugs. Mastigoproctus sometimes preys on small vertebrate s. The prey is crushed between special teeth on the inside of the trochanters (the second segment of the &quot; legs &quot; ) of the front appendages. They are valuable in controlling the population of roaches and crickets. Males secrete a sperm sac, which is transferred to the female. Up to 35 eggs are laid in a burrow, within a mucous membrane that preserves moisture. Mothers stay with the eggs and do not eat. The white young that hatch from the eggs climb onto their mother&apos;s back and attach themselves there with special suckers. After the first molt, they look like miniature vinegarroons, and leave the burrow; the mother dies soon after. The young grow slowly, going through three molts in about three years before reaching adulthood. They live for up to another four years. [ Habitat ] Vinegarroons are found in tropical and subtropical areas excluding Europe, Australia, and, except for an introduced species, Africa. They usually dig underground burrows with their pedipalps, to which they transport their prey. They may also burrow under logs, rotting wood, rocks, and other natural debris. They prefer humid, dark places and avoid light. They also live in the Southern and Southwestern United States. [ Subtaxa ] [ List of Thelyphonidae species ] As of 2006, over 100 species of vinegarroons have been described worldwide. Subtaxa of vinegarroons currently include only one extant family and a doubtful extinct family: { Mastigoproctus giganteus &apos;&apos; female with eggs } Hypoctoninae Pocock, 1899 Etienneus Heurtault, 1984 Hypoctonus Thorell, 1888 Labochirus Pocock, 1894 Thelyphonellus Pocock, 1894 Mastigoproctinae Speijer, 1933 Mastigoproctus Pocock, 1894 Mimoscorpius Pocock, 1894 Uroproctus Pocock, 1894 Thelyphoninae Lucas, 1835 Abaliella Strand, 1928 Chajnus Speijer, 1936 Ginosigma Speijer, 1936 Glyptogluteus Rowland, 1973 Minbosius Speijer, 1933 Tetrabalius Thorell, 1888 Thelyphonus Latreille, 1802 Typopeltinae Rowland &amp; Cooke, 1973 Typopeltis Pocock, 1894 incertae sedis † Geralinura Scudder, 1884 † Mesoproctus Dunlop, 1998 † Proschizomus Dunlop &amp; Horrocks, 1996 Rowland &amp; Cooke (1973) [ J.

They also presented a novel classification that included the division of the group into two families, Thelyphonidae and Hypoctonidae. Weygoldt (1979) [ P. Weygoldt 1979 Thelyphonellus ruschiin. sp. und die taxonomische Stellung von ThelyphonellusPocock 1894 (Arachnida: Uropygi: Thelyphonida) Senckenbergiana Biologica 60 109–114 ] suggested the existence of two families was not supported by the available data, and Haupt &amp; Song (1996) [ J. Haupt &amp; D. Song 1996 Revision of East Asian whip scorpions (Arachnida Uropygi Thelyphonida). I. China and Japan Arthropoda Selecta 5 43–52 ] formally reduced the Hypoctonidae to a subfamily as there was little support for a monophyletic Hypoctonidae. Dunlop &amp; Horrocks (1996) [ J. A. Dunlop &amp; C.A. Horrocks 1996 A new Upper Carboniferous whip scorpion (Arachnida: Uropygi: Thelyphonida) with a revision of the British Carboniferous Uropygi Zoologischer Anzeiger 234 293–306 ] suggested that the hypoctonids may be the sister-group to the Schizomida and Proschizomus Dunlop &amp; Horrocks 1996, but the character polarities they utilized were regarded as uncertain and many features of Proschizomus were not observable in the fossilized material.
