This image leads to the expression [ &quot; oni with an iron club &quot; 鬼に金棒 oni-ni-kanabō ], that is, to be invincible or undefeatable.

These nebulous beings could also take on a variety of forms to deceive (and often devour) humans. Thus the Chinese character 鬼 ( [ kuí gwai 2 ] ) meaning &quot; ghost &quot; came to be used for these formless creatures. The invisible oni eventually became anthropomorphized and took on its modern, ogre-like form, partly via syncretism with creatures imported by Buddhism, such as the Indian rakshasa and yaksha, the hungry ghost s called gaki, and the devilish underlings of Enma-Ō who punish sinners in Jigoku (Hell). [ Demon Gate ] { kanabō. } Another source for the oni&apos;s image is a concept from China and Onmyōdō. The northeast direction was once termed the kimon (鬼門, &quot; demon gate &quot; ), and was considered an unlucky direction through which evil spirits passed. Based on the assignment of the twelve zodiac animals to the cardinal directions, the kimon was also known as the ushitora (丑寅), or &quot; ox tiger &quot; direction, and the oni&apos;s bovine horns and cat-like fangs, claws, and tiger-skin loincloth developed as a visual depiction of this term.

Enryakuji, on Mount Hiei northeast of the center of Kyoto, and Kaneiji, in that direction from Edo Castle, are examples. The Japanese capital itself moved northeast from Nagaoka to Kyoto in the 8th century.

Men in oni costumes often lead Japanese parade s to ward off any bad luck, for example. Japanese buildings sometimes include oni-faced roof tiles called [ onigawara 鬼瓦 ], which are thought to ward away bad luck, much as gargoyle s in Western tradition.

Many Japanese idioms and proverbs also make reference to oni. For example, the expression [ oya ni ninu ko wa oni no ko 親に似ぬ子は鬼の子 ] means literally &quot; a child that does not resemble its parents is the child of an oni, &quot; but it is used idiomatically to refer to the fact that all children naturally take after their parents, and in the odd case that a child appears not to do so, it might be because the child&apos;s true biological parents are not the ones who are raising the child. Depending on the context in which it is used, it can have connotations of &quot; children who do not act like their parents are not true human beings, &quot; and may be used by a parent to chastise a misbehaving child. Variants of this expression include [ oya ni ninu ko wa onigo 親に似ぬ子は鬼子 ] and [ oya ni ninu ko wa onikko 親に似ぬ子は鬼っ子 ].
