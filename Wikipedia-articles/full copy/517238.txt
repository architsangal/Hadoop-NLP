The 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 87 by Dmitri Shostakovich is a set of 24 pieces (that is, 24 prelude-fugue pairs) for solo piano, one in each of the major and minor keys of the chromatic scale. The cycle was composed in the years 1950-51 while Shostakovich was in Moscow and premiered by pianist Tatiana Nikolayeva in Leningrad in December, 1952; { Mazullo, Mark. Shostakovich&apos;s Preludes and Fugues: Contexts, Style, Performance, p.24. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010). ISBN 978-0-300-14943-2. } it was published the same year. The complete work takes about two and a half hours to play. [ Form and structure ] Each piece is in two parts—a prelude and a fugue --varying in pace, length and complexity (for example, Fugue No. 13 in F-sharp major is in five voices, but Fugue No. 9 in E major is in only two voices). The pieces proceed in relative major/minor pairs around the circle of fifths : first C major and A minor (prelude and fugue nos. 1 and 2), then to one sharp (G major, E minor), two sharps (D major, B minor), and so on, ending with D minor (1 flat). ( Frédéric Chopin &apos;s set of 24 Preludes, Op. 28, is organised in the same way, as are the earlier sets of preludes by Joseph Christoph Kessler, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, and Shostakovich&apos;s earlier 24 Preludes, Op. 34.) [ Relationship to Bach&apos;s Well-Tempered Clavier ] J.S. Bach &apos;s The Well-Tempered Clavier, an earlier set of 24 preludes and fugues, is widely held to be the direct inspiration for Shostakovich&apos;s cycle, largely based on the work&apos;s composition history (see below). References to and quotations from Bach&apos;s cycle appear throughout the work. { Mazullo, Mark. Shostakovich&apos;s Preludes and Fugues: Contexts, Style, Performance, p.27. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010). ISBN 978-0-300-14943-2. } For example, Shostakovich begins his C major prelude, the first piece in the cycle, with exactly the same notes that Bach uses in his own C major prelude, BWV 846, which likewise begins the Well-Tempered Clavier). Likewise, the composers&apos; second fugues (A minor for Shostakovich, C minor for Bach) utilize very similar opening rhythms for their fugue subjects (two 16th notes followed by 3 eighth notes, twice in a row). In addition to more direct quotation, Shostakovich also at points imitates the various types of preludes found in the Bach cycle (and in other, similar, Baroque compositions). For example, his A minor prelude is a figuration prelude --a prelude in which the same hand position is used throughout the piece. Examples of this abound in Baroque keyboard literature from composers such as Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer, from whom Bach drew inspiration for his own figuration preludes (the C major and the D minor, for example). { Ledbetter, David. Bach&apos;s Well-Tempered Clavier: the 48 preludes and fugues, p. 56. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002). ISBN 0-300-09707-7. } On a larger scale, the whole structure, ordered and sequenced as it is with no apparent extra-musical narrative, is largely a response to Bach. It is important to note, however, that in Bach&apos;s cycle the pieces are arranged in parallel major/minor pairs ascending the chromatic scale (C major, C minor, C sharp major, C sharp minor etc.), which differs from Shostakovich&apos;s op. 87. There are also several references and musical ideas taken from Shostakovich&apos;s own work. [ History ] After the Second World War, Dmitri Shostakovich was Russia&apos;s most prominent composer. Although out of favour with the Soviet Communist Party, he was still sent abroad as a cultural ambassador. One such trip was to Leipzig in 1950 for a music festival marking the bicentennial of J. S. Bach &apos;s death. As part of the festival, Shostakovich was asked to sit on the judging panel for the first International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition. One of the entrants in the competition was the 26-year-old Tatiana Nikolayeva from Moscow. Though not required by competition regulations, she had come prepared to play any of the 48 preludes and fugues of The Well-Tempered Clavier on request. She won the gold medal. Inspired by the competition and impressed by Nikolayeva&apos;s playing, Shostakovich returned to Moscow and started composing his own cycle of 24 preludes and fugues. Shostakovich worked fairly quickly, taking only three days on average to write each piece. As each was completed he would ask Nikolayeva to come and visit him in his Moscow apartment where he would play her the latest piece. The complete work was written between 10 October 1950 and 25 February 1951. Once finished, Shostakovich dedicated the work to Nikolayeva, who undertook the public premiere in Leningrad on 23  December 1952. Shostakovich wrote out all the pieces without many corrections except the B-flat minor prelude, with which he was dissatisfied and replaced what he had begun initially. [ The pieces ] [ section February 2012 ] [ June 2008 ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 1 in C major ] In unbroken chords and a haunting melody Shostakovich nevertheless evokes the immortal first Prelude of the 48. The tone is wistful, mostly pianissimo and the harmonic language is very much Shostakovich&apos;s own, though not a note is out of place. The tone continues in the Fugue; whereas Bach begins with a scaled 4th, Shostakovich has a bleak bare 5th. In contrast to the characteristic harmonic complexity of the prelude, the fugue is written in the purest C major, without a single accidental. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 2 in A minor ] The prelude is a toccata mostly for one voice, with semiquavers running through in the style of a perpetuum mobile. It is followed by a three-part fugue with a characteristic theme of sevenths and acciaccaturas. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in G major ] The Prelude in G is composed of a juxtaposition of a pesante theme and a lighter quicker theme, the latter quoting a motif from the first movement of Shostakovich&apos;s own 10th symphony. The following fugue is the only one set in 6/8 time, although this meter is also shared by the F-sharp Major Prelude. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 4 in E minor ] The prelude begins with an eighth-note appoggiatura figuration phrased in pairs between a sustained cantus firmus in the bass and a lyrical melody in the soprano. There is a consistent legato /half- staccato phrasing throughout the prelude in which Shostakovich attempts to imitate Baroque period phrasing. Following the prelude, Shostakovich proceeds directly to the fugue without pause. The fugue is a double fugue in four voices with two distinct subjects developed in separate expositions. The first subject is a slow stepwise melody consisting mostly of half note s and quarter note s, while the second subject is a partial diminution or variation on the first subject (eighth notes instead of quarter notes). About two-thirds into the fugue, Shostakovich brings back the original subject in the bass combined with the second subject in the soprano. The E Minor Fugue is one of progressive complexity. The composition begins rather humbly with a quiet, conservative exposition, but it ends triumphantly with nearly every possible fugal device (invertible counterpoint, stretto, double stretto, diminution, augmentation, retrograde ) exploited in the final bars. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 5 in D major ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 6 in B minor ] Beginning much like a French overture (dotted rhythms) this prelude remains very tonal throughout. The bass plays has much of the melodic content - again a device used by Bach in his 48 preludes and fugues.The following fugue starts with a short introduction. It then continues in a gentle weaving fashion (much like the C sharp minor fugue from Book one of Bach&apos;s 48). Much of the piece uses a counter melody against the fugal entries. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 7 in A major ] The A major prelude is a two-part invention that begins with a tonic pedal and a cheerful, delicate motif that almost could have come from Bach’s quill. Amazingly, the fugue contains no vertical dissonances whatsoever, instead creating harmonic motion by sporadically touching on unrelated keys such as B flat major, D flat major, and C major. While there is little in the way of thematic or textural development, the piece oozes charm, and the final cadence comes all too soon. The three-voice fugue begins with a statement of the main theme, or subject, in the soprano voice. While fugal subjects usually use stepwise motion, this subject uses only the notes of the A major triad. This subject is then stated a fourth below in the alto, as would be expected in a Baroque fugue. After a brief interplay between the soprano and alto, the bass is introduced with a statement of the subject, completing the exposition. The modulatory section begins in the minor key; a brief return to the tonic key provides a breath of calm before an increasingly frenzied series of modulations. These lead to a climax in A major, signalled by a dominant pedal, but this lasts just four bars before the music plunges into C major. The music then settles down, gently leading to the recapitulation, where a single statement of the subject in the tonic key brings the piece to a close. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 8 in F-sharp minor ] Short piece, very agitated in nature. Staccato and chromatics add to the chilling nature of the melody. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 9 in E major ] A fugue in two voices. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 10 in C-sharp minor ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 11 in B major ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 12 in G-sharp minor ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 13 in F-sharp major ] A fugue in five voices. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 14 in E-flat minor ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 15 in D-flat major ] The prelude is a brusque waltz typical of Shostakovich. The opening theme resembles &quot; We Wish You a Merry Christmas &quot;. The date of the composition (20 December) may explain this. The fugue is a tour de force of chromatic writing. The subject contains 11 of the 12 semitones available. [ Prelude and Fugue No. 16 in B-flat minor ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 17 in A-flat major ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 18 in F minor ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 19 in E-flat major ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 20 in C minor ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 21 in B-flat major ] Hear example below [ Prelude and Fugue No. 22 in G minor ] &apos;&apos;&apos;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5DCwK1EQcYWritten and Played by Shostakovich&apos;&apos;&apos; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8nNYUlMlxg &amp; feature=relatedTatiana Nikolaeva playing, chosen by Shostakovich to debut these Prelude and Fugue arrangements [ Prelude and Fugue No. 23 in F major ] [ Prelude and Fugue No. 24 in D minor ] This double fugue shares a key signature and several features with the last fugue from Bach&apos;s The Art of Fugue. [ Reception ] Before premiering the work, Shostakovich privately performed the first half of the cycle before the Union of Composers, (as was typical with new compositions during the Soviet Era) on March 31, 1951. { Mazullo, Mark. Shostakovich&apos;s Preludes and Fugues: Contexts, Style, Performance, p.22. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010). ISBN 978-0-300-14943-2. } The panel expressed great displeasure at the dissonance in some of the fugues. They also objected to the fugue in Soviet music because it was considered too Western and archaic. This work is considered by many (e.g. music critic Alex Ross, musicologist Tanya Ursova, etc.) to be produced by the &quot; other Shostakovich, &quot; or as a composition &quot; for the desk drawer. &quot; { Ursova, Tanya. &quot; Shostakovich&apos;s 24 Preludes and Fugues op. 87: Subtexts in Context, &quot; DSCH Journal 22 (January 2005), pp. 11-14 } { Ross, Alex. The Rest is Noise, pp. 280-81. (Picador, 2008). ISBN 978-0-312-42771-9. } According to Ross, the composer used chamber forms in the period to channel his most personal compositions, those that would not be suitable for use or approval by the Soviet Government. This piece is included in that group along with several string quartets. [ References ] [ Bibliography ] Fay, Laurel (1999). Shostakovich: A Life. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-513438-9.
