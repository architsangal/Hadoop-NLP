In the early 1910s, the northern part of the township seceded to form Bay Village. In 1912, a southern portion left to join North Olmsted. The remaining township residents formed Dover Village in 1913, taking with it a portion of Olmsted Township. Dover Village was renamed Westlake in 1940. This was done to eliminate confusion with Dover, Ohio (itself now part of the Cleveland television market). The village of Westlake became a city in 1957. { About Our City } The Westlake Historical Society was formed to inform and educate others about the history of Dover/ Westlake.
