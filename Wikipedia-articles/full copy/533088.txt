Then in 1835 a Birmingham solicitor called John Wilkes Unett bought [ 7 acre m2 ] of land and built the Crescent, later known as the Royal Crescent. It was opened in the 1850s and for 100 years it was the most fashionable address in the North of England. English composer Frederick Delius stayed as a boy on the Crescent with his family at Miss Hurd&apos;s boarding house (number 24) in 1876 and 1877 and then also at Mrs. Colley&apos;s (number 24) in 1897.
