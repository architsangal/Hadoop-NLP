Similar to the freedb project, it was founded in response to the restrictions placed on the CDDB. However, MusicBrainz has expanded its goals to reach beyond a compact disc metadata storehouse to become a structured open online database for music. { Highfield, Ashley. &quot; Keynote speech given at IEA Future Of Broadcasting Conference &quot;, } { BBC } { Press Office, 2007-06-27. Retrieved on 2008-02-11. } MusicBrainz captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships between them. Recorded works entries capture at a minimum the album title, track titles, and the length of each track. These entries are maintained by volunteer editors who follow community written style guidelines. Recorded works can additionally store information about the release date and country, the CD ID, an acoustic fingerprint for each track and have an optional free-form text field or annotation attached to them. [ 2012 4 19 ], MusicBrainz contained information about 660,000 artists, 1 million releases, and 11 million recordings. [ Database Statistics MusicBrainz http://musicbrainz.org/statistics 2012-04-19 ] End-users can use software that communicates with MusicBrainz to add metadata tag s to their digital media files, such as MP3, Ogg Vorbis or AAC. [ Fingerprinting ] MusicBrainz initially used Relatable&apos;s patent ed TRM (a recursive acronym for TRM Recognizes Music) for acoustic fingerprint matching. This feature attracted a lot of users and allowed the database to grow at a fast rate. By 2005 it became obvious Relatable&apos;s fingerprinting solution didn&apos;t scale well to the millions of tracks in the database and the search for a viable replacement began. On May 12, 2006, Robert Kaye posted an announcement on the project&apos;s official blog about a partnership between MusicBrainz and MusicIP. [ New fingerprinting technology available now! 2006-03-12 MusicBrainz community blog http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/03/new_fingerprint.html 2006-08-03 ] Part of the agreement allows MusicBrainz to use MusicIP&apos;s MusicDNS service for acoustic fingerprinting ( PUID s ). Since November 24, 2008 TRMs have been phased out and MusicBrainz rely solely on PUIDs. MusicBrainz uses RDF / XML for describing music metadata, which is available for automated processing via HTTP GET and POST methods according to REST architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. In 2011 MusicDns was purchased by Gracenote and the service to be closed down over time, so MusicBrainz have started phasing it out in favour of the open source AcoustID. { Picard 0.16 released with AcoustID support } [ Licensing ] MusicBrainz&apos;s core data (artists, recordings, releases, and so on) is in the public domain, and additional content including moderation data (essentially every original content contributed by users and its elaborations) is placed under the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA -2.0 license. { MusicBrainz License as of 13-11-2010. } The relational database management system is PostgreSQL.
