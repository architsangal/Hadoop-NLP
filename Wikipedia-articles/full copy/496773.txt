It was created in 1894 from townships of eastern Algoma District and west Nipissing District. The overwhelming majority of the district (about 92%) is unincorporated and part of Unorganized North Sudbury District. With the exception of Chapleau, all of the district&apos;s incorporated municipalities are found in the area immediately surrounding the city of Greater Sudbury to the west, east and south. North of the Greater Sudbury area, the district is sparsely populated; between Sudbury and Chapleau, only unincorporated settlements, ghost town s and small First Nations reserves are found. [ Status of Greater Sudbury ] Because the districts of Northern Ontario are unincorporated territorial divisions, unlike the counties or regional municipalities of Southern Ontario, the city of Greater Sudbury is legally defined as part of the district in the geographic sense. Politically, however, the district and the city are considered two distinct census divisions and two distinct jurisdictions for provincial government services. The district&apos;s social services board — which has offices in the district seat of Espanola, as well as satellite offices in several other communities in the district — instead shares its jurisdictional area with the neighbouring Manitoulin District, whereas equivalent services in Greater Sudbury, which has the status of a single-tier municipality, are provided directly from the city.

Therefore, the table above does not include the data for the City of Greater Sudbury. [ Provincial highways ] The Sudbury District is served by Trans-Canada Highway s 17, which leads from the community of Walford ( Sables-Spanish Rivers ) in the west to the community of Warren ( Markstay-Warren ) in the east, and 69, which enters the district at French River and exits at the southern boundary of Greater Sudbury. The Ontario government is converting Highway 69 to a freeway. Construction, and renumbering as Highway 400, are expected to be complete by 2017. Other primary provincial highways in the district are: Highway 6, which extends from Highway 17 south to Whitefish Falls, where it enters the Manitoulin District, Highway 64, which runs from Highway 69 east and north through the Municipality of French River, and enters the Nipissing District at Mashkinonje Provincial Park, Highway 101, which extends from the boundary of Algoma District, west of Chapleau, to the boundary of Cochrane District, just outside of Timmins, Highway 129, which runs from Highway 101 to the boundary of Algoma District south of Chapleau, Highway 144, which runs from the northwestern city limits of Greater Sudbury north to the boundary of Timiskaming District, just outside of Timmins. The Sudbury District also has a number of secondary provincial highways, which are the analogue in a district to county or municipal roads in Southern Ontario. They are important connections to the communities they serve, but are not significant routes for through traffic. The secondary highways are: Highway 528, connecting the community of Wolseley Bay ( French River ) to Highway 64, Highway 528A, which provides access to the south side of the water body at Wolseley Bay, Highway 535, connecting Highway 64 at Noëlville ( French River ) to Highway 17 at Hagar ( St. Charles ), Highway 553, extending north from the community of Massey ( Sables-Spanish Rivers ), Highway 560, which runs from Highway 144 to the boundary of Timiskaming District, through Shining Tree, Highway 560A, which connects Westree to Highway 560, Highway 607, which runs from Bigwood ( French River ) to Highway 64, Highway 607A, which provides road access to the French River, Highway 637, which runs from Highway 69 to the community of Killarney, Highway 661, which connects the community of Gogama to Highway 144.
