Overall Whenever You Need Somebody sold 15.2 million copies worldwide, making him the top selling British act of the year.

In 1989 he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist, but lost to Tracy Chapman. His fifth and final release from his debut album was &quot; It Would Take a Strong Strong Man &quot;. It was a more soulful song, when compared to his other releases, and was mainly intended for the North American market. Thus, it was not released in Britain. It was another hit for Astley, reaching #10 on the U.S Billboard Hot 100, and #1 in Canada.

[ http://www.talktalk.co.uk/music/biography/artist/rick-astley/biography/10843 Rick Astley - Biography TalkTalk 2010-05-15 ] This was despite Astley writing five of his new album&apos;s tracks. The negative press inevitably affected the sales of his singles. [ http://www.rickastley.co.uk/discography/singles/singles09.html Discography -Hold Me In Your Arms www.rickastley.co.uk 2010-05-15 ] The first single from the album to be released was &quot; She Wants To Dance With Me &quot;, a number penned by Astley himself. It was another successful single, reaching #6 on both the UK and US charts. &quot; Take Me to Your Heart &quot; was the next single to be released from the album. It reached #8 in the UK and was not released in the US. The Astley-written ballad &quot; Hold Me in Your Arms &quot; reached #10 in the UK and was also not released in North America. The next two singles released from the album were intended for the North American market. &quot; Giving Up On Love &quot; and a cover of The Temptations song &quot; Ain&apos;t Too Proud To Beg &quot; charted at #38 and #89 in the US respectively. In December 1989, Astley set off on his first world tour, touring 15 countries including the UK, US, Australia, and Japan. By the end of the tour, Astley was tiring of the negative press, and wanted to explore alternative paths as a musician. Thus, he left his producers Stock Aitken Waterman, with RCA records buying out his contract with PWL. [ Switching to soul and AC ] By 1990, Astley had parted company with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman. He also decided to leave his dance-pop days behind him, moving towards his passion, soul. This shift in musical genre led him to change his image too, ditching the boy next door look, presenting himself as a mature and passionate musician. His third album, Free, was released in 1991 containing collaborations with Elton John. The album contained three singles, and reached #9 in the UK and #31 in the US. He achieved one more major success with the 1991 ballad &quot; Cry for Help &quot;, which reached #7 in both the UK and the US. This would place Astley in The Guinness Book of Records, as he became the first male solo artist to have his first eight singles all chart in the UK Top 10. This record still stands to this day. The other two singles from Free were not as successful. &quot; Move Right Out &quot; reached #58 in the UK and #81 in the US; and &quot; Never Knew Love &quot; reached #70 in the UK and did not chart in the US. Free would mark the end of Astley&apos;s successful period, and &quot; Cry for Help &quot; would be the last Astley single to make the Top 10 in either the UK or US (as of May 2010). His next album, Body and Soul, was released in 1993, and was largely an Adult Contemporary album. By the time the album was released, Astley had decided to retire from the music industry. As a result, the album did not get a lot of promotion, not charting in the UK but managing to make the Billboard 200, peaking at #182. The two singles, &quot; The Ones You Love &quot; and &quot; Hopelessly &quot;, performed very well on the US adult contemporary chart, peaking at #19 and #4 respectively. &quot; The Ones You Love &quot; peaked at #48 in the UK but did not chart in the US. &quot; Hopelessly &quot; also crossed over and peaked at #28 on the US Billboard 100, staying in the US top 40 for five weeks, and #33 in the UK. It was named as one of the most performed songs at the 1994 BMI Awards, { The Eighties Club } and is one of the few songs to achieve BMI &apos;Million-Air&apos; status. { BMI Million-Airs } [ Retirement ] After 1993, Astley decided to retire from the music industry at the young age of 27, deciding that family life was more important. During Astley&apos;s time out of the music business, he raised his daughter Emilie, born in 1992. Thus, for much of the 1990s and early 2000s, Astley remained largely out of the spotlight. One notable musical appearance by Astley during retirement was as a backing singer on The Lion King soundtrack in 1994. [ Return to singing ] Almost 10 years after Body and Soul, Astley finally returned to the music world, signing a co-publishing deal with Polydor and releasing Keep It Turned On in 2002. The album featured the single &quot; Sleeping &quot;, which became a minor club hit, thanks to a set of remixes from U.S. house producer Todd Terry. Keep It Turned On was only released in Continental Europe. Astley&apos;s first compilation album, Greatest Hits, was released in 2002, and reached #16 on the UK Albums Chart. With no promotion from Astley, it sold over 100,000 copies and was certified Gold by the BPI. After retirement in 1993, Astley continued to write songs for various acts and in 2003 he managed to chart at #10 in the UK as a songwriter with &quot; Shakespeare&apos;s (Way With) Words &quot; performed by short-lived boy band One True Voice. In 2004, Astley toured for the first time in 14 years, which led him to a record contract with Sony BMG. In March 2005, Astley released the album Portrait in which he covered many classic standards such as &quot; Vincent &quot;, [ video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DttfTJuU3frA%26amp%3Bfeature%3Drelated Astley Rick Vincent (Live) YouTube ] &quot; Nature Boy &quot; and &quot; Close to You &quot;.
