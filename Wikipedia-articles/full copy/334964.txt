[ August 2011 ] [ 1944 08 11 ] { Ottawa, } { Ontario } { Social Worker } { Halifax Regional Municipality, } { Nova Scotia } { Liberal (1970-1974) } { New Democratic Party (1974-present) } { NDP } { Baptist } Alexa Ann McDonough OC (n√©e Shaw, born August 11, 1944) is a Canadian politician who became the first woman to lead a major, recognized political party in Canada, when she was elected the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party &apos;s (NSNDP) leader in 1980. She served as a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature from 1981 to 1994, representing the Halifax Chebucto and Halifax Fairview electoral districts. She stepped down as the NSNDP&apos;s leader and as a member of the legislature in 1994. She subsequently ran for, and was elected, leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1995. McDonough was elected the Member of Parliament (MP) for the federal electoral district of Halifax in 1997. She stepped down as party leader in 2003, but continued to serve as an MP for two more terms, until 2008, when she retired from politics altogether. In 2009 she became the interim president of Mount Saint Vincent University and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in December of that year. [ Early life and education ] McDonough was born Alexa Ann Shaw in Ottawa, Ontario in 1944. Her parents were Jean MacKinnon and Lloyd Robert Shaw, a wealthy businessman who was committed to progressive politics.

McDonough was involved in social activism from an early age, when, at 14, she led her church youth group in publicizing the conditions of Africville, a low-income neighbourhood in Halifax. She attended Queen&apos;s University in Kingston, Ontario, which was her family&apos;s alma mater. [ N.S. NDP leader faces lonely road Michael Harris The Globe and Mail Toronto October 20, 1981 10 January 1, 2010 ] After two-years, she transferred to Dalhousie University in Halifax, where she completed a sociology and psychology Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965. She became a social worker, and during the 1970 Nova Scotia general election, worked for Gerald Regan &apos;s Liberal Party, writing that party&apos;s social policy platform. She quickly became disenchanted with Regan and the Liberals, and joined the New Democratic Party in 1974.

In the 1980 federal election, she lost to former Nova Scotia premier Gerald Regan, the same politician that she once supported back in 1970. Just after the federal election, Jeremy Akerman stepped down as the Nova Scotia NDP&apos;s leader, in the spring of 1980. At this time, there was a growing rift between the Cape Breton Island and Mainland wings of the party. [ Caustic Cape Bretoner a pariah in NDP Barbara Yaffe The Globe and Mail Toronto June 6, 1980 11 January 1, 2010 ] This rift exploded in June, when Paul MacEwan, the NDP MLA for Cape Breton Nova, was expelled from the party due to his constant public airing of internal party disputes, including the implication that Akerman resigned due to &quot; Trotskyist elements &quot; from the mostly mainland-based provincial executive council.

Despite these internecine battles, and not having a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, McDonough decided to enter the leadership race. The other candidate in the race to replace Akerman was Len Arsenault, the MLA for the Cape Breton North riding. [ Woman leads Nova Scotia NDP Canadian Press The Toronto Star Toronto November 17, 1980 A5 January 1, 2010 ] The leadership convention was convened in Halifax, with the leadership vote held on November 16, 1980. McDonough received 237 votes, compared to Arsenault&apos;s 42 votes, and MacEachern&apos;s 41 votes, giving her a first ballot landslide victory. As a result of her victory, she became the first woman in Canada to lead a major recognized political party.

[ MLA expelled from NDP caucus Canadian Press The Globe and Mail Toronto December 10, 1980 10 January 1, 2010 ] Since she did not have a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, the party was left with just two seats, because MacEwan was now an independent, and Akerman&apos;s seat was left vacant due to his resignation. For almost a year, she would sit in the Assembly&apos;s visitors gallery until she could run for a seat in the 1981 Nova Scotia general election. McDonough&apos;s first provincial election as leader was fought in the Halifax Chebucto riding, where the Liberals and Conservatives were more or less evenly matched in terms of voter support, and the NDP was a distant third in the previous election.

McDonough was personally popular throughout Nova Scotia, consistently being the voters&apos; top choice in leadership polls, but her popularity did not rub-off on the party. She led the party through three more elections, eventually building the caucus up to three members: all from the mainland, including future Nova Scotia NDP leader, Robert Chisholm. After fourteen years as the Nova Scotia NDP leader, which at the time made her the longest-serving leader of a major political party, she stepped down on November 19, 1994.

The 1993 Canadian federal election was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster for the NDP. [ Globe Editorial Retooling the New Democrats The Globe and Mail Toronto A26 October 28, 1993 January 1, 2010 ] Under Audrey McLaughlin &apos;s leadership, the party suffered its worst defeat since the late 1950s, in terms of seats, when it was then called the CCF. When looking at the popular vote, it was the worst ever election for a federal social-democratic party in the 20th century, with just seven percent of the vote. The party only had nine seats, three short of the twelve seats needed to have official party status in the House of Commons, and all the extra funding, research, office space and Question Period privileges it accords. In the aftermath of the 1993 election, the party set about reforming its policies and purpose, with McLaughlin announcing on April 18, 1994, that she would step down as leader by 1996. [ Delacourt Susan NDP plans to redesign the left: McLaughlin to give up helm The Globe and Mail Toronto A1, A6 April 19, 1994 January 1, 2010 ] McLaughlin, faced with internal squabbles eerily like the ones that occurred in the Nova Scotia party back in 1980, advanced her departure from the end of 1996 to the end of 1995. [ Howard Ross NDP sets new style for leadership race The Globe and Mail Toronto A1, A2 January 23, 1995 January 1, 2010 ] With an internal party atmosphere that could best be described as toxic, McDonough entered the leadership race in the spring of 1995. The conditions were similar to the ones she faced during her first leadership campaign in 1980: a divided party that was self-immolating. However, the party was also hobbled by unpopular provincial NDP governments in Ontario and British Columbia. Indeed, the NDP had suffered particularly severe losses in those two provinces at the federal level in 1993, losing all of its Ontario MPs and all but two of its British Columbia MPs‚Äîmore than half of its caucus. Prior to the NDP leadership convention on October 14, 1995, McDonough was widely viewed as an also-ran behind the leading contenders, Svend Robinson and Lorne Nystrom, but at the convention she placed second on the first ballot, ahead of Nystrom in what was almost a three way vote split. [ Second fiddle leads NDP: McDonough wins, Robinson gives in Hugh Windsor The Globe and Mail Toronto October 16, 1995 A1, A5 December 30, 2009 ] Although Robinson had placed first on that ballot, he felt that most of Nystrom&apos;s supporters would go to McDonough on the second ballot, giving her the victory. Thus, he conceded to McDonough before a second ballot could be held, and moved a motion to formally appoint her as the new leader. McDonough became the first person from Atlantic Canada to lead a major party since Robert Stanfield retired as the Progressive Conservatives&apos; leader in 1976. [ Johnson William Feuding must end, Stanfield cautions in a blunt farewell The Globe and Mail 1976-02-21 Toronto 1‚Äì2 ] Unusually for a major-party leader, she did not have one of her MPs in a safe seat resign so she could get into Parliament via a by-election, opting instead to make a third bid for her home riding of Halifax in the next general election. In the 1997 election, her first as leader, the party won 21 seats. This included a historic breakthrough in the Atlantic provinces, a region where it had only won three seats in its entire history prior to 1997. McDonough herself won Halifax by 11,000 votes, pushing Liberal incumbent Mary Clancy into third place. She would continue to win it consecutively three more times until she retired from politics in 2008. During the next few years, McDonough&apos;s leadership of the party elicited controversy.

In the 2000 federal election, the NDP was held to just 13 seats, and its 8.5 percent of the popular vote, was near its historic low from the 1993 campaign. About the only solace the NDP and McDonough could take from the 2000 campaign was that they were at least able to maintain official party status in the House of Commons (if only barely), unlike McLaughlin in the 1993 campaign. After the disappointing performance in the 2000 federal election, there were calls for party renewal, again. Some party activists perceived that the NDP had moved to the centre of the political spectrum and wanted to change that by bringing in social/political activists outside of the parliamentary process. They called their movement the New Politics Initiative, or NPI. [ So, really, what&apos;s the NDP?

With Brian Masse &apos;s May 2002 by-election victory, in the Windsor West riding, the party&apos;s caucus grew to 14 members. A few weeks later, on June 6, 2002, McDonough used this positive turn in electoral fortunes to announce that she was stepping down as NDP leader. On January 25, 2003, at the Toronto leadership convention, she was succeeded by Jack Layton. She was re-elected to Parliament in the 2004 federal election and again in 2006.
