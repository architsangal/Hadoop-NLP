In 1953 she gained her doctorate in philosophy, psychology and sociology at University of Basel in Switzerland. For the next 20 years Miller studied and practised psychoanalysis. Her first three books originated from research she took upon herself as a response to what she felt were major blind spots in her field. However, by the time her fourth book was published, she no longer believed that psychoanalysis was viable in any respect. [ Capps Donald The child’s song: the religious abuse of children Westminster Knox Press 1995 Louisville, Kentucky 3–20 ] In 1979, Miller stopped practising as a psychoanalyst after having studied and practised psychoanalysis for 20 years and became critical of both Freud and Carl Jung. In 1986, she was awarded the Janusz Korczak Literary Award for her book Thou Shalt Not Be Aware: Society&apos;s Betrayal of the Child. [ Encyclopedia of human rights Edward H. Lawson Mary Lou Bertucci Taylor &amp; Francis 1996 1-56032-362-0 943 ] Her final book, Bilder meines Lebens ( &quot; Pictures of My Life &quot; ), was published in 2006; an informal autobiography in which the writer explores her emotional process from painful childhood, through the development of her theories and later insights, told via the display and discussion of 66 of her original paintings, painted in the years 1973 to 2005.

Between 2005 and her death in 2010, she answered some readers&apos; letters on her website, where there are also published articles, flyers and interviews in three languages. { Child abuse and mistreatment } { Readersmail incl. answers } Miller died on April 14, 2010, at her home in Saint-Rémy de Provence, France. { William Grimes, &quot; Alice Miller, Psychoanalyst, Dies at 87; Laid Human Problems to Parental Acts &quot; (Obituary), } { New York Times, 2010 April 26. } [ Work ] Miller extended trauma model to include all forms of child abuse, including those that were commonly accepted (such as spanking), which she called poisonous pedagogy, a non-literal translation of Katharina Rutschky &apos;s Schwarze Pädagogik (black or dark pedagogy/imprinting). [ Miller Alice Por tu propio bien TusQuets 1985 Barcelona 17–95 ] Drawing upon the work of psychohistory, Miller analyzed writers Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka and others to find links between their childhood trauma s and the course and outcome of their lives. [ Miller Alice El cuerpo nunca miente TusQuets 2005 Barcelona 37–41 &amp; 48–50 ] The introduction of Miller&apos;s first book, The Drama of the Gifted Child, first published in 1979, contains a line that summarizes her core views: [ Miller Alice El drama del niño dotado TusQuets 2001 Barcelona 15 ] In the 1990s, Miller strongly supported a new method developed by Konrad Stettbacher, who himself was later charged with incidents of sexual abuse. { Barbara Lukesch: Das Drama der begabten Dame: Alice Miller steht wegen eines Scharlatans vor einem Scherbenhaufen. First published in: Facts, 29 June 1995. (German) } Miller came to know about Stettbacher and his method from a book by Mariella Mehr titled Steinzeit (Stone Age). Having been strongly impressed by the book, Miller contacted Mehr in order to get the name of the therapist. From that time forward, Miller refused to make therapist or method recommendations. In open letters, Miller explained her decision and how she originally became Stettbacher&apos;s disciple, but in the end she distanced herself from him and his regressive therapies. { Alice Miller: &quot; Communication to My Readers &quot; } { A Reaction To the Appendix To Alice Miller&apos;s Communication } Miller blamed abusive parents for the majority of neuroses and psychoses. She maintained that all instances of mental illness, crime and falling prey to religious cults were ultimately caused by childhood trauma and inner pain that were not assisted by a helper, which she came to term an &quot; enlightened witness. &quot; In all cultures, &quot; sparing the parents is our supreme law, &quot; wrote Miller. Even psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and clinical psychologists were unconsciously afraid to blame parents for the mental disorder s of their clients, she contended. According to Miller, mental health professionals were also creatures of the poisonous pedagogy internalized in their own childhood. This explained why the command &quot; Honor thy parents &quot; was one of the main targets in Miller&apos;s school of psychology. [ Miller Alice Breaking down the walls of silence Dutton/ Penguin Books 1991 NY ] { Miller’s critique of the commandment is expanded in her book The body never lies } Miller called electroconvulsive therapy &quot; a campaign against the act of remembering. &quot; In her book Abbruch der Schweigemauer (The Demolition of Silence), she also criticized psychotherapists &apos; advice to clients to forgive their abusive parents, arguing that this could only hinder recovery through remembering and feeling childhood pain. It was her contention that the majority of therapists fear this truth and that they work under the influence of interpretations culled from both Western and Oriental religions, which preach forgiveness by the once-mistreated child. She believed that forgiveness did not resolve hatred, but covered it in a dangerous way in the grown adult: displacement on scapegoats, as she discussed in her psycho-biographies of Adolf Hitler and Jürgen Bartsch, both of whom she described as having suffered severe parental abuse. { this book is (legally) available online } A common denominator in Miller&apos;s writings is her explanation of why human beings prefer not to know about their own victimization during childhood: to avoid unbearable pain. She believed that the unconscious command of the individual, not to be aware how he or she was treated in childhood, led to displacement : the irresistible drive to repeat traumatogenic modes of parenting in the next generation of children. [ Miller Alice Thou shalt not be aware: society’s betrayal of the child Meridan Printing 1984 NY ] [ Writings ] The following is a brief summary of Miller&apos;s books. [ &lt; small &gt; The Drama of the Gifted Child &lt; preblock &gt; &lt; preline &gt; (Das Drama des begabten Kindes, 1979) &lt; /preline &gt; &lt; /preblock &gt; ] In her first book (also published under the titles Prisoners of Childhood and The Drama of the Gifted Child), Miller defined and elaborated the personality manifestations of childhood trauma. She addressed the two reactions to the loss of love in childhood, depression and grandiosity; the inner prison, the vicious circle of contempt, repressed memories, the etiology of depression, and how childhood trauma manifests itself in the adult. [ &lt; small &gt; For Your Own Good &lt; preblock &gt; &lt; preline &gt; (Am Anfang war Erziehung, 1980) &lt; /preline &gt; &lt; /preblock &gt; ] Miller proposed here that German traumatic childrearing produced Hitler and a serial killer of children named Jürgen Bartsch. Children learn to take their parent&apos;s point of view against themselves &quot; for their own good. &quot; In the case of Hitler, he learned to take his parents&apos; point of view against himself, against Jews, and against other groups of people. For Miller, the traditional pedagogic process was manipulative, resulting in grown-up adults deferring excessively to authorities, even to tyrannical leaders or dictator s, like Hitler. Miller even argued for abandoning the term &quot; pedagogy &quot; in favor of the word &quot; support, &quot; something akin to what psychohistorians call the helping mode of parenting. The key element that Miller elucidated in this book was the understanding of why the German nation, the &quot; good Germans, &quot; were compliant with Hitler&apos;s abusive regime, which Miller asserted was a direct result of how the society in general treated its children. She raised fundamental questions about current, worldwide child-rearing practices and issued a stern warning. [ &lt; small &gt; Thou Shalt Not Be Aware &lt; preblock &gt; &lt; preline &gt; (Du sollst nicht merken, 1981) &lt; /preline &gt; &lt; /preblock &gt; ] Unlike Miller&apos;s later books, this one is written in a semi-academic style. It was her first critique of psychoanalysis, charging it with being similar to the poisonous pedagogies, which she described in For Your Own Good. Miller was critical of both Freud and Carl Jung. She scrutinized Freud&apos;s drive theory, a device that, according to her and Jeffrey Masson, blames the child for the abusive sexual behavior of adults. Miller also theorized about Franz Kafka, who was abused by his father but fulfilled the politically-correct function of mirroring abuse in metaphorical novels, instead of exposing it. In the chapter entitled &quot; The Pain of Separation and Autonomy, &quot; Miller examined the authoritarian (e.g.: Old Testament, Papist, Calvinist ) interpretation of Judeo-Christian deism and its parallels to modern parenting practice, asserting that it was Jesus &apos;s father Joseph who should be credited with Jesus&apos;s departure from the dogmatic Judaism of his time. Miller&apos;s views were similar to those in Jack Miles &apos;s 1996 Pulitzer Prize winner, God: A Biography, questioning man&apos;s representations and character of God rather than the existence or deity of God. [ &lt; small &gt; The Untouched Key &lt; preblock &gt; &lt; preline &gt; (Der gemiedene Schlüssel, 1988) &lt; /preline &gt; &lt; /preblock &gt; ] This book was partly a psychobiography of Nietzsche, Picasso, Kollwitz and Buster Keaton; (in Miller&apos;s later book, The Body Never Lies, published in 2005, she included similar analyses of Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, Schiller, Rimbaud, Mishima, Proust and James Joyce ). According to Miller, Nietzsche did not experience a loving family and his philosophical output was a metaphor of an unconscious drive against his family&apos;s oppressive theological tradition. She believed that the philosophical system was flawed because Nietzsche was unable to make emotional contact with the abused child inside him. Though Nietzsche was severely punished by a father who lost his mind when Nietzsche was a little boy, Miller did not accept the genetic theory of madness. She interpreted Nietzsche&apos;s psychotic breakdown as the result of a family tradition of Prussian modes of child-rearing. [ &lt; small &gt; Banished Knowledge &lt; preblock &gt; &lt; preline &gt; (Das verbannte Wissen, 1988) &lt; /preline &gt; &lt; /preblock &gt; ] In this more personal book Miller shared that she herself was abused as a child. She also introduced the fundamental concept of &quot; enlightened witness &quot; : a person who was willing to support a harmed individual, empathize with her and help her to gain understanding of her own biographical past. Banished Knowledge is autobiographical in another sense. It is a pointer in Miller&apos;s thoroughgoing apostasy from her own profession—psychoanalysis. She believed society was colluding with Freud&apos;s theories in order to not know the truth about our childhood, a truth that human cultures have &quot; banished. &quot; She concluded that the feelings of guilt instilled in our minds since our most tender years reinforces our repression even in the psychoanalytic profession. [ &lt; small &gt; Breaking Down the Wall of Silence &lt; preblock &gt; &lt; preline &gt; (Abbruch der Schweigemauer, 1990) &lt; /preline &gt; &lt; /preblock &gt; ] Written in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Miller took to task the entirety of human culture. What she called the &quot; wall of silence &quot; is the metaphorical wall behind which society — academia, psychiatrists, clergy, politicians and members of the media — has sought to protect itself: denying the mind-destroying effects of child abuse. She also continued the autobiographical confession initiated in Banished Knowledge about her abusive mother. In Pictures of a Childhood: Sixty-six Watercolors and an Essay, Miller said that painting helped her to ponder deeply into her memories. In some of her paintings, Miller depicted baby Alice as swaddled, sometimes by an evil mother. { - a painting by Alice Miller } [ I betrayed that little girl [...]. Only in recent years, with the help of therapy, which enabled me to lift the veil on this repression bit by bit, could I allow myself to experience the pain and desperation, the powerlessness and justified fury of that abused child. Only then did the dimensions of this crime against the child I once was, become clear to me. Miller: Breaking down the walls of silence, (op. cit.), pp. 20f ] In a The New York Times obituary of April 26, 2010 British psychologist Oliver James is quoted saying that Alice Miller &quot; is almost as influential as R.D. Laing. &quot; [ See also ] [ 3 * Child abuse * Dani Levy * Narcissistic abuse * Poisonous pedagogy – further explanation of Miller&apos;s theories * Psychohistory * Trauma model of mental disorders ] [ Bibliography ] Miller&apos;s published books in English: The Drama of the Gifted Child, (1978), revised in 1995 and re-published by Virago as The Drama of Being a Child.
