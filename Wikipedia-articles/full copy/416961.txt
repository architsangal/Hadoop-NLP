Some of his earliest memories are of campaigning in General Elections for his uncle, Ifor Davies, MP for Gower and deputy to Cledwyn Hughes at the Welsh Office in Harold Wilson&apos;s Government.Davies went to Gowerton Comprehensive School (where his mother was a secretary), and later achieved a BA (Hons) at Crewe and Alsager College, and an MSc from Swansea Metropolitan University. After leaving higher education he worked for local authorities in leisure management; and it was while he was working in a sports centre and she was doing aerobics that he met his wife, Joanna Irranca, a member of an Italian family who had come to work in south Wales in the 1950s. On marriage the couple both changed their surnames to Irranca-Davies.Later, Irranca-Davies worked in private sector management, and also spent enjoyable years as a lecturer at Swansea Metropolitan University. [ Member of Parliament ] In 2001 he was Labour candidate for the Brecon &amp; Radnor constituency in 2001, but finished third, behind the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates. In the by-election of 14 February 2002 he was elected to the parliamentary seat of Ogmore in the South Wales Valleys (a Labour seat since 1918), after the death of MP and Government Whip Sir Ray Powell. (Irranca-Davies was himself appointed Government Whip for Wales in May 2006 after spells as a Parliamentary Aide in several government departments.) He was re-elected to serve Ogmore in the general elections of May 2005 and May 2010. For the first time in 2010, Ogmore became the largest parliamentary majority of any party and constituency in Wales. Since his election in 2002 Irranca-Davies has worked on a range of local and national issues, including sitting on the Procedures Select Committee to discuss ways of modernising the work of Parliament and has also sat on Standing Committees for the Police Reform Bill, Fireworks Bill and Communications Bill, amongst others.

Irranca-Davies serves as Chair of the All Party Group for the Recognition of Munitions Workers. During World War II, many ‘munitioneers’ settled in Ogmore and across South Wales to work at the Welsh Arsenal in Bridgend. There, they worked to supply troops with weaponry and ammunition. However, their efforts along with those working in Royal Ordnance Factories across the UK, have yet to be officially recognised. The All Party Group has been working towards this recognition. While Huw spends the majority of his week at work in Parliament, he returns to his constituency in Ogmore on the weekends to carry out advice clinics, meet with constituents and attend events.
