He plays at centre back for Manchester United in the Premier League and for the England national football team. He has amassed 81 caps for England in total, and has been a member of three FIFA World Cup squads.

He became a fan favourite, winning the &apos;Hammer of the Year award&apos; the following season. He earned his first senior international cap in a match against Cameroon in 1997, setting a record as the youngest defender to play for England at the time. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Leeds United and he transferred to the club for a record-breaking fee of £18  million. He spent two seasons at the club, becoming the team captain in 2001. He joined Manchester United in July 2002 for around £ 30  million, breaking the transfer fee record once more. He won the Premier League, his first major club honour, in a successful first season at the club. In September 2003, he missed a drugs test and was banned from competition for eight months from January until September 2004, causing him to miss half a Premier League season, Manchester United&apos;s FA Cup triumph, and the Euro 2004 international competition. Upon his return, he established himself in the Manchester United first team and received plaudits for his performances, featuring in the PFA Team of the Year three times in four years. More club success followed with another Premier League win in the 2006–07 season and a Premier League and UEFA Champions League double the following year. Ferdinand has three children, Lorenz, Tate and Tia, with his wife Rebecca Ellison. He was born into a footballing family: brother Anton Ferdinand is also a centre-back for Queens Park Rangers and former England international striker Les Ferdinand is his cousin, as is Southend United midfielder Kane Ferdinand. Off the pitch he is involved with youth charities, film, music, and television including the prank series Rio&apos;s World Cup Wind-Ups.

Both his parents worked to support the family, his mother as a child carer and his father as a tailor. His parents never married and they separated when he was 14 years old. His father remained close, moving to a nearby estate, and he was keen to stay involved in his children&apos;s lives, taking them to football training and to local parks. He attended Camelot primary school and was a boisterous child who numbered Mike Tyson and Diego Maradona among his heroes.

[ http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jun/01/manchesterunited A united front Llewellyn Smith Caspar The Observer London Guardian Media Group 1 June 2008 6 November 2008 ] At school, he focused on maths and revelled in the opportunity to perform before an audience during a school production of Bugsy Malone. He also impressed his classmates with skill on the playground, constantly playing football, dreaming of turning professional and seeing new places. &quot; I always as a kid wanted to do something different, I&apos;d get bored very easily – even playing football or hanging around with my mates. So travelling away from home, meeting new people.... I enjoyed it. &quot; He chose to attend Blackheath Bluecoat School, a school somewhat distant from his house, in order to meet new friends and he settled in well, feeling his confidence growing. His second year was marred by the death of a fellow pupil, Stephen Lawrence, and the event demonstrated the ever-present threat of violence. Ferdinand enjoyed physical expression, taking part in not just football and gymnastics classes but drama, theatre and ballet too. He was an able child: he represented Southwark in Gymnastics at the London Youth Games [ http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/9081346.London_gymnastics_team_wins_gold_at_the_weekend/?ref%3Dmmpg Croydon Guardian London gymnastics team wins gold at the weekend London 2011-06-14 12-03-19 ], by age 10 he had been invited to train at the Queens Park Rangers academy, and at age 11 he won a scholarship to attend the Central School of Ballet in London. He avidly attended the ballet classes, travelling to the city centre four days a week for four years. However, while the lessons surely improved his balance, it was professional football that he desired. [ Youth team career ] Ferdinand&apos;s superior footballing abilities were evident even as a child: when he was eleven years old a youth coach, David Goodwin, remarked &quot; I&apos;m going to call you Pelé, son, I like the way you play. &quot; Ferdinand was regularly playing in youth teams and at Eltham Town he played as an attacking midfielder but team scouts saw the young player had the physical potential to be a centre back instead. Teams vied for the young footballer&apos;s services and during his youth he trained with Charlton Athletic, Chelsea, Millwall and Queens Park Rangers. Ferdinand was ever curious of different places and even travelled north to Middlesbrough &apos;s training ground, spending a good part of his school holidays in a bedsit just to be there. London team West Ham United was to be his footballing home, however, and he joined their youth system in 1992. He signed his first Youth Training Scheme contract in January 1994 and played alongside players such as Frank Lampard at the academy.

During the 2002 FIFA World Cup, rumours began circulating that the club were in dire financial trouble and that new manager Terry Venables would be forced to part with his star defender for a substantial amount of cash. Later that summer after Ferdinand&apos;s impressive World Cup for England, Leeds accepted a bid of £29.1  million due to their perilous financial position.

Leeds United later took a single payment in place of all the contingent elements when they were desperate for cash during their financial crisis.

Ferdinand went on to win the Premier League title with Manchester United in his first season at the club. He has also collected a winner&apos;s medal in the 2006 League Cup, with runners-up medals in the 2003 League Cup and the 2005 FA Cup. In September 2003, he failed to attend a drug test, claiming he had forgotten because he was preoccupied with moving houses and instead went shopping. The FA Disciplinary Committee chaired by Barry Bright imposed an eight month ban from January 2004 at club and international level and a £50,000 fine, meaning he would miss the rest of the season and some of the next along with all of Euro 2004. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3333091.stm Ferdinand banned for eight months BBC Sport 19 December 2003 26 August 2008 ] Manchester United appealed against the verdict and sought to draw parallels to the case of Manchester City player Christian Negouai, who was fined £2,000 for missing a test. However, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that such comparisons are inappropriate due to differences between the two cases. Negouai had been stuck in traffic and was willing to take the test, while Ferdinand was charged with &quot; failure or refusal &quot; to attend the test.

Ferdinand was named in the squad for this game and was a likely starter, however the public mourning for Princess Diana – whose chauffeur had been suspected of drink-driving – left Glenn Hoddle with little choice but to drop the talented teenager from the squad.
