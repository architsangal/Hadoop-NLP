It is a women-only college, which admits only postgraduate s and undergraduates aged 21 or over. The college was founded in 1965 by women researchers and lecturers of the University of Cambridge who felt that women were not thoroughly represented within the university. It was originally known as the Lucy Cavendish Collegiate Society. It moved to its current site in 1970, was granted consent to call itself &quot; Lucy Cavendish College &quot; in 1986, and gained the status of a full college of the university by Royal Charter in 1997.

The first president of Lucy Cavendish College, from 1965 to 1970, was Anna McClean Bidder, one of the founding members of &quot; The Dining Group &quot; and a zoologist specializing in cephalopod digestion; this accounts for the presence of the nautilus shell in the college crest.
