[ Playing career ] Afanasenkov began his North America n ice hockey career after being drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft in the third round, 72nd overall. He started playing in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Moncton Wildcats in his first season, and then for the Sherbrooke Castors in the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons. Following the 2000–01 season, he was signed by the Lightning. Until the 2003–04 NHL season, he would split his time between the Lightning and their farm team. He would play for one IHL team (the Detroit Vipers ) and two AHL teams (the Grand Rapids Griffins and Springfield Falcons ). During the 2003–04 NHL season, his rookie season, he scored six goals and ten assists during the regular season and three points during the Lightning&apos;s post season run to the 2004 Stanley Cup. Following the lockout, he returned to the Lightning, but with the presence of Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis, and Brad Richards, he had limited playing time. He did not put up the numbers he could, and so, on December 30, 2006, the Lightning waived him and he was picked up by the Philadelphia Flyers. While in Philadelphia, Afanasenkov picked up the nickname &quot; The Shark &quot;, scoring 15 points (8 goals, 7 assists) in 41 games with the Flyers. A pending restricted free agent, he was not tendered a qualifying offer and became an unrestricted free agent. He signed with Dynamo Moscow on August 1, 2007 and signed on 26 September 2009 for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. [ Trivia ] He has played 227 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Tampa Bay Lightning and Philadelphia Flyers, and was a member of Tampa Bay&apos;s Stanley Cup team in 2004.
