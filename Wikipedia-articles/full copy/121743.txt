Population was 528 at the 2010 census. Originally a logging community, it was a dairy community for most of it history, but could now be best described as a bedroom community, since most of its working population finds employ in nearby Duluth, Grand Rapids, Hibbing and Cloquet. The city describes itself as &quot; The Catfish Capital of the World &quot;, a nickname it gave to itself following the introduction of the community&apos;s annual Catfish Days festival. U.S. Highway 2 and State Highway 73 are two of the main arterial routes in the city. [ History ] Long before the city of Floodwood existed, its strategic location at the intersection of the East Savanna River with the Saint Louis River made what would later become the city of Floodwood a strategic economic location. The Savanna Portage was a major route for transportation in the southern Arrowhead, but its importance was magnified greatly with the arrival of European fur traders, who used the route to access rich resources of beaver and other fur animals in the upper Mississippi valley. As early as 1679, Europeans were passing by the modern location of Floodwood as they turned from the Saint Louis River to the East Savanna River on their way to the portage. However, it was not until the late 19th Century that homesteads began to appear in the area. In 1889, it was announced that a railroad would pass through the area. [ http://www.lakesnwoods.com/Floodwood.htm Floodwood Minnesota Community Guide Lakeweb1 Internet Services A Guide to Minnesota Communities 2010-01-16 ] This announcement led to a local population boom in anticipation of the opportunities the railroad would bring. In 1890 J. C. Campbell began large-scale logging operations in the area and the C. N. Nelson Lumber Company of Cloquet built a logging railroad in the area (albeit, the logging railroad only operated in the winter - during the summer, the logging operations took advantage of the Saint Louis River to transport timber to mills in Cloquet). In 1893, the year that local government was first organized, the first Floodwood School building was constructed of logs. [ http://www.floodwood.k12.mn.us/About_Us/School_History.htm History Floodwood School ISD 698 2010-01-16 ] [ October 2010 H3llBot ] The following year, the Nelson Company was purchased by what would, six years later, become the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, continuing the intensification of logging activities in the area. The community continued to grow and, in 1899, was finally incorporated. By the time the 1900 United States Census was conducted, Floodwood had a population of 224, which, within the next ten years, more than doubled to 481. [ http://www.morris.umn.edu/services/cst/dar/mdc/census/view/countyPlaceCensus.php?cousub%3D21338 Census Data for Floodwood (City) University of Minnesota Morris 2010-01-16 ] In 1911, the Floodwood School, which had previously been a county school, became Independent School District No. 19 (after 1958, Independent School District 698), and a new, six room, brick building was built for it. The community continued to grow until the 1918 Cloquet Fire nearly ended the city&apos;s history. However, Floodwood, like most of its presently exstant neighbors, survived the fire and began a slow recovery. However, the practical importance of the rivers, and thus Floodwood&apos;s greatest economic resource, ended. By 1926, the era of large-scale timber operations in the area had come to a close. With the logging operations gone, Floodwood&apos;s survival was again in peril. The solution had already been present since 1911: as the surrounding areas had pastures suitable for supporting dairy cattle, the focus of the community&apos;s economy, following the exit of the timber companies, turned to dairy production. In 1911, the Floodwood Creamery Cooperative was organized. The Creamery became the main support of the local economy, selling local dairy products across the world until it closed in the late 1960s. Although the Creamery is long gone, dairy cattle are still a major part of the local economy. The 1970 Census showed, for the first time since 1920, that Floodwood&apos;s population had decreased. This began a trend that has endured to the present - the last time a census showed an increase in Floodwood&apos;s population was in 1960. [ Geography ] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [ 0.4 mi2 km2 ], all of it land. Floodwood sits at the junction of U.S. Highway 2 and Minnesota State Highway 73. It is roughly half way between Duluth and Grand Rapids along U.S. Highway 2, as well as roughly half way between Hibbing and Moose Lake along State Highway 73. Also nearby is the city of Cloquet. The city sits at the junctions of the Floodwood River and the East Savanna River with the Saint Louis River. The area surrounding the city largely comprises forests, wetlands and, where the conditions permit, dairy farms. Nearby peat bogs employ many people from Floodwood, Meadowlands and other communities in southwest Saint Louis County. Protected areas near Floodwood include Savanna Portage State Park, the Savanna State Forest and the Floodwood Game Reserve. The Savanna Portage, together with the three rivers that meet in the city, contributes much to local culture.

The current mayor of Floodwood is Jeff Kletscher, [ Government Structure City of Floodwood 2010-01-19 ] who presides over meetings of the city council. The position of City Administrator, created in 2002 to handle the day-to-day operations of the city&apos;s administration, is currently held by Jess Rich. Floodwood, like the rest of Saint Louis County and neighboring Carlton County, was, prior to the 1960s, part of a strong area for co-operative economics, having a strong worker cooperative (in the form of the Floodwood Creamery Cooperative), a farmers&apos; cooperative and a credit union; today all that remains of the cooperative past in Floodwood is the credit union. During the 1930s, this tendency toward cooperative economics led Saint Louis County in general to be a major stronghold of the Farmer-Labor Party, [ O&apos;Connell Thomas Gerald Toward the Cooperative Commonwealth: An Introductory History of the Farmer-Labor Movement in Minnesota 1979 http://justcomm.org/fla-hist.htm 2010-01-19 ] which aimed to create a cooperative commonwealth in Minnesota. When the Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Minnesota Democratic Party, the area became a stronghold for the resultant Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). For sixty-four years, beginning with the 1947 election of John Blatnik, the area had been constantly represented by Democrats in the United States House of Representatives. This streak was broken with the seating of Republican Chip Cravaack, after his upset victory of over the normally popular Democratic incumbent Jim Oberstar in the 2010 Congressional election. Floodwood is part of Minnesota&apos;s 8th congressional district, having previously been represented by Oberstar in Congress since 1975. In every recent partisan election ( President, Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, State Auditor, State Treasurer, US Senate, US House, State Senate and State House ), Floodwood has given a substantial majority, usually a supermajority, of its votes to the Democratic or DFL candidate. In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama won the city with 73.49% of the vote to John McCain &apos;s 23.69%.

Floodwood is also part of Minnesota Senate District 5, which is represented by Dave Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm). In May 2009, when city leaders from throughout Minnesota made the trek to the State Capitol, Mayor Kletscher made statewide news when he made the comment &quot; My toolbox is empty. We&apos;ve been facing this for years. We&apos;re a very poor city and we can&apos;t afford to see tax rates go up. &quot; [ MAOSC Board Member Floodwood Mayor Jeff Kletscher Makes Statewide News Fighting For Small Cities Minnesota Association of Small Cities 2010-01-19 ] The city leaders were arguing against cuts to state funding for communities in Governor Pawlenty &apos;s budget cuts.
