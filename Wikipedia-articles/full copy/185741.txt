McCoun said, &quot;  if you&apos;re satisfied you&apos;re guilty or you believe it&apos;s in your best interest to plead guilty... let me know that. &quot; Al-Arian replied, &quot; I believe it&apos;s in my best interest to enter a plea. &quot; The district court judge asked Al-Arian whether he had been promised anything else by anyone to induce his guilty plea, and he said that he had not. The plea agreement was unsealed and accepted by Judge James S. Moody on April 17, 2006. The count carried a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. Al-Arian remained in custody pending his sentencing and deportation. The deal came after 11 years of Federal Bureau of Investigation investigations, wiretaps and searches, and three and a half years of trial preparation, time Al-Arian spent in jail, most of it in solitary confinement. { Meg Laughlin, Plea deal overcame the discord, } { St. Petersburg Times, April 24, 2006. } Amnesty International said Al-Arian&apos;s pre-trial detention conditions &quot; appeared to be &apos;gratuitously punitive&apos; &quot;, and that &quot; the restrictions imposed on Dr. Al-Arian appeared to go beyond what were necessary on security grounds and were inconsistent with international standards for humane treatment. &quot;.

Each time, he refused to testify. He challenged the initial subpoena in four different federal courts, each of which held that he was in fact required to testify. He was imprisoned for 13 months for civil contempt for failing to testify in compliance with the first subpoena. He is awaiting trial as well for criminal contempt for his failure to testify in compliance with the second and third subpoenas. [ Grand jury subpoenas, refusal to testify, civil contempt, and hunger strikes ] Subpoena In May 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a subpoena to Al-Arian to testify before a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, in an investigation into the alleged financing of terror by the Herndon, Virginia -based International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). Homeland Security agent David Kane described alleged ties between Al-Arian and IIIT in an affidavit that was unsealed in 2003, saying that IIIT was once the largest contributor to a PIJ group run by Al-Arian. Kane also alluded to a letter from a leader of IIIT to Al-Arian saying he considered him and leaders of the Palestinian resistance to be &quot; a part of us and an extension of us. &quot; { Lichtblau, Eric, &quot; Court Papers Show Charges That Group Aided Terrorists &quot;, &apos;&apos;The New York Times&apos;&apos;, October 18, 2003, accessed March 8, 2010 } Refusal to testify The subpoena was served on Al-Arian in October 2006. He sought to quash it on the assertion that his plea agreement prevented his being forced to testify before the Virginia grand jury. He said the government had agreed that he would not be required to cooperate with it in any manner, though that specific agreement was not reflected in the written plea agreement. In a verbal agreement that he says appears in court transcripts, federal prosecutors agreed he would not have to testify in Virginia. { Gaunt Al-Arian shocks family by Meg Laughlin. St. Petersburg Times. March 20, 2007. } Second, Al-Arian also said he refused to testify because he believed &quot; his life would be in danger if he testified. &quot; Third, Al-Arian claimed he has no information that could further the investigation. { Witness Is Silent in Terror Probe: Ex-Professor Says Grand Jury Testimony Would Endanger Him.

We admire him and are proud of him.

The court held him in civil contempt, and imprisoned him on November 16, 2006, for contempt of court, with the days served for civil contempt not counting towards the days of imprisonment he had remaining on his guilty conspiracy plea. He appealed the Virginia District Court decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower court&apos;s ruling. Thirteen months later, on December 14, 2007, the Virginia District Court lifted its contempt order, starting the clock ticking again on his days-served on his conspiracy guilty plea sentence. Florida District Court; hunger strike A Florida District Court also held that the plea agreement was not ambiguous, and did not prevent the government from issuing a subpoena requiring him to testify before a grand jury. Al-Arian, who is diabetic, began a 60-day hunger strike on January 22, 2007, to &quot; protest continued government harassment. &quot; { Family says inmate&apos;s hunger strike not near end.

Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals Al-Arian appealed the Florida District Court decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court on January 25, 2008. It pointed out that the plea agreement did not contain any mention of whether Al-Arian would be compelled to testify in front of a grand jury in the future. It also noted that the agreement said it reflected all promises and agreements between Al-Arian and the government, and that this accorded with Al-Arian&apos;s statement, when questioned by the trial court judge, that there were no promises or inducements made to him other than those reflected in the written agreement. Furthermore, the court observed that the plea agreement only spoke to the issue of the government prosecuting Al-Arian for crimes known to the office at the time of the agreement, but did not immunize Al-Arian from future subpoenas. The court therefore held the plea agreement to be clear, unambiguous, and to not grant Al-Arian immunity from the grand jury subpoena. The Justice Department issued its third subpoena later that month. Professor Robert Chesney, of Wake Forest University Law School, said: It is certainly not uncommon for the government to expect a defendant to testify in the wake of a plea agreement. In this instance, the agreement is silent on the question, and the court of appeals agrees with the government that this leaves the door open to subpoena his testimony. Hunger strike In March 2008 he began another hunger strike, to protest his subpoena. He ended his hunger strike two months later. { Democracy Now! | Al-Arian Enters 19th Day of Hunger Strike in Protest of &quot; Government Harassment &quot; } Special imprisonment A 2011 NPR report claimed some of the people associated with this case were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit.

Attorneys alleged Virginia prosecutors are &quot; ultimately not interested in IIIT … but want to revisit the Tampa trial. &quot; In a motion filed on March 4, 2009, prosecutors in Virginia acknowledged that when Al-Arian took the plea deal in early 2006, prosecutors in Tampa believed that it exempted him from testifying in other cases.
