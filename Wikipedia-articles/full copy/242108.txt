They presently play in the Welsh Premier Division. Newport RFC are based at Rodney Parade situated on the east bank of the River Usk. Due to the regionalisation of Welsh rugby in 2003 Newport RFC is now a feeder club to Newport Gwent Dragons regional team. Every major rugby union touring team to visit Wales has played at Rodney Parade, and all of them were beaten at least once in the twentieth century by a side who, in 1951, played in the match at Cardiff RFC that attracted what was, a world-record crowd of 48,500 for a rugby union match between two clubs. [ The Rugby Clubs of Wales 96 David Parry-Jones 1989 0-09-173850-4 ] In addition to matches against all the major national sides a highlight of the Newport season was the annual match against the Barbarians, ensuring that the Newport fans enjoyed watching world-class players to supplement the Welsh internationals who were a common feature of the &apos;Black and Ambers&apos;. [ History ] [ 1874–1914 ] Newport RFC were formed in 1874 under the financial backing of the Phillips brewing family, and the playing talents of former pupils of Monmouth School, { Smith (1980), pg 25. } a public school which had adopted rugby union in 1873. { Smith (1980), pg 23. } Newport was originally intended as an association football club, but was unable to find any opponents, but they managed to organise a rugby match against Cardiff RFC, and in 1875 played Cardiff in both clubs&apos; first-ever game. Newport’s early success was remarkable, winning every single match in their first four seasons between 1875 and 1879.

In 1881 Newport was one of the eleven clubs present at the forming of the Welsh Rugby Football Union, { Smith (1980), pg 41. } and provided six players in the first Welsh international match, more than any other club. { Smith (1980), pg 40. } { London Welsh 31 December 1904 } Partially due to their geographical location Newport also played against more established clubs from England and in 1878 a game was arranged against Manchester Athletic followed by games against Birmingham, Clifton, Gloucester and Swindon. Their dominance led Newport’s club secretary, Richard Mulloch to arrange a match against the English domestic champions Blackheath Rugby Club. With a record attendance of 5,000 spectators Newport were out-classed by their English opponents, losing four goals and eight tries to nil. However, Newport had played two games in the previous five days and Blackheath brought in outside players to bolster their squad. { Smith (1980), pg 35. } In October 1879 Newport played Cardiff RFC in a floodlit game at Rodney Parade; the first ground to have floodlights installed in Wales. In 1887, Newport player Charlie Newman was given the captaincy of the Welsh national team, he was the first Newport player to achieve this honour. In 1887 Newport player Tom Clapp was given the Wales captaincy and in 1888 he led the first Welsh side to beat Scotland, a team that included Newport players Powell and Gould. During the 1891/92 season, under captain Tom Graham Newport went unbeaten, winning 29 games and drawing four. Graham brought a new professional attitude to the team, introducing weekly gym training and an avoidance of alcohol. { Smith (1980), pg 71. } In 1912 Newport hosted the touring South Africa national team, and beat them 9 points to 3. { Smith (1980), pg 189. } [ 1919–1939 ] Invincible in 1922/3 Welsh Club Champions 1920,1923.
