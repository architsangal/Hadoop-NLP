He became a political advisor to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Michael Jopling for two years from 1984. [ Parliamentary career ] Boswell was chosen to contest the Daventry constituency after the sitting Conservative MP and former Labour Cabinet member Reg Prentice had announced his retirement. Tim Boswell was elected as the Conservative MP for Daventry at the 1987 general election with a majority of 19,690 and held the seat very comfortably since. Tim Boswell&apos;s Westminster career began unsurprisingly as a Member of the Agriculture Select Committee in 1987. He became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury Peter Lilley in 1989. Tim Boswell entered John Major&apos;s government in 1990 as an Assistant Government Whip, following the 1992 General Election he was promoted within the Whip&apos;s Office and became a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury.

In opposition Boswell was a spokesman on the Treasury in the immediate aftermath of the 1997 election defeat and became a spokesman on Trade and Industry under William Hague, before speaking on Education and Employment in 1999 until after the 2001 General Election. He became the spokesman for Work and Pensions under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith, moving briefly to speak on Constitutional Affairs in 2003 under Michael Howard and back to Work and Pensions in 2004, where he remains following the 2005 General Election. On 31 March 2006, Boswell announced his intention not to contest the subsequent general election, provided it did not take place unexpectedly soon. The Daventry seat was split in two at the 2010 general election, with the northern portion becoming part of a new Daventry constituency and the southern part becoming part of a South Northamptonshire constituency.
