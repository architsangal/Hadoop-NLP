The most common modern version is: Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep, And can&apos;t tell where to find them; Leave them alone, And they&apos;ll come home, Wagging their tails behind them. I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 93-4. Common variations on second line include &quot; And doesn&apos;t know where to find them. &quot; The fourth line is frequently given as &quot; And bring their tails behind them. &quot; This alternative version is useful in the extended version, usually of four further stanzas.

Fuld, The Book of World-Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk (Courier Dover Publications, 5th edn., 2000), ISBN 0486414752, p. 502. } Little Bo Peep, by Walter Crane c.1885. 464249 Little-Bo-Peep.mid Play [ Additional verses ] The following additional verses are often added to the rhyme: Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep, And dreamt she heard them bleating; But when she awoke, she found it a joke, For they were still a-fleeting. Then up she took her little crook, Determined for to find them; She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed, For they&apos;d left their tails behind them. It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray Into a meadow hard by, There she espied their tails side by side, All hung on a tree to dry. She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye, And over the hillocks went rambling, And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should, To tack each again to its lambkin.

Illustration by Dorothy M. Wheeler [ Origins and history ] The earliest record of this rhyme is in a manuscript of around 1805, which contains only the first verse. There are references to a children&apos;s game called &quot; Bo-Peep &quot;, from the sixteenth century, including one in Shakespeare&apos;s King Lear (Act I Scene iv), but little evidence that the rhyme existed. The additional verses are first recorded in the earliest printed version in a version of Gammer Gurton&apos;s Garland or The Nursery Parnassus in 1810. Older inhabitants of Ninfield, East Sussex (a former smuggling center) will tell you that Bo-Peep was its most famous resident. The story goes that her sheep were walked across the shore to disguise smuggler&apos;s footprints. The valley to the south of the A269 in Ninfield joins the Pevensey Level marsh area and was small-boat navigable until the Late Middle Ages. [ In literature ] In O. Henry ’s romantic story “Madame Bo-Peep, of the Ranches” Octavia Beaupree comes to the Rancho de las Sombras in Texas, the only real property she inherits after the bankruptcy and death of her husband, Colonel Beaupree. Her old friend and unsuccessful admirer Teddy Westlake who works at the ranch as a manager calls her by the name of Mother Goose&apos;s heroine, the Mexican workers call her “La Madama Bo-Peepy” and the ranch becomes known as “Madame Bo-Peep&apos;s ranch”. Finally, Octavia accepts Teddy’s proposal, he chants the first quatrain of the nursery rhyme, after the third line she draws his head down, whispers in his ear and the story ends with the words “But that is one of the tales they brought behind them.” [ In popular culture ] Bo Peep is the female lead in the 1934 Babes in Toyland. The character also appears in the 1961 film version, but not as a leading character. The character appears as &quot; Bo Peep, &quot; a ceramic doll, in the animated film series Toy Story. In the 1950s, comedian Johnny Standley recorded a line-by-line commentary on the poem, titled &quot; It&apos;s in the Book. &quot; He ridicules what he sees as the simplistic attitude of the person addressing Bo Peep, and ends his commentary up with &quot; wagging their tails: Pray tell, what else could they wag?!? &quot; behind them. Did we think they&apos;d wag them in &apos;&apos;front?!!? &quot; In the Ben­ny Hill &amp; Lit­tle Bo Peep, Sin­ful Swe­den ver­sion (http://www.myspace.com/video/doc-oc/benny-hill-little-bo-peep-naked-lust-in-sinful-sweden-version/37730995) In the anime Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo she is given the name &quot; Little Bobobo-Peep. &quot; In the continuity of the Fables comic book from Vertigo, she is the wife of Peter Piper, and lives in Fabletown &apos;s northern branch, the &quot; Farm. &quot; Her story, along with that of Peter and his evil brother Max (the future Pied Piper of Hamelin ), is told in Bill Willingham &apos;s novel Peter &amp; Max: A Fables Novel.

Little Bo Peep finds them in Teletubbyland and then she and the sheep fly away. In the new film, Hoodwinked Too! Bo Peep appears as an agent at HFAA. She appears in a few scenes but doesn&apos;t have any speaking lines. Her sheep also appear.
