Depending on where it is purchased, and the length of validity, a Travelcard is either printed on a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe or encoded onto a reusable contactless electronic smart card, known as an Oyster card. The cost of a Travelcard is determined by the area it covers and, for this purpose, London is divided into a number of fare zones. The Travelcard season ticket for unlimited travel on London Buses and the London Underground was launched on 22 May 1983 by London Transport.

The introduction of the Travelcard caused an increase in patronage and reduced the number of tickets that needed to be purchased by passengers. [ History ] Poster advertising the January 1985 launch of the Capitalcard ticket Before the introduction of the Travelcard, tickets for the London Underground were purchased on a &apos;point-to-point&apos; basis between two stations, either as a single, return or season ticket; and were priced according to distance travelled.

The Travelcard was introduced as the third in a series of major fare revisions that had started in 1981. The introduction of the Travelcard was intended to increase patronage on London Underground and London Buses, particularly during less busy times and to speed up the boarding of bus services. On 4 October 1981, following the Greater London Council election, the incoming Labour administration simplified fares in Greater London by introducing four new bus fare zones and two central London Underground zones, named City and West End, where flat fares applied for the first time. This was accompanied by a cut in prices of about a third and was marketed as the Fares Fair campaign. Following successful legal action against it, on 21 March 1982 [ http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/poster/poster.html?_IXSR_%3D9n3i9oiIqAG%26amp%3B_IXMAXHITS_%3D1%26amp%3BIXinv%3D2000%2F7142%26amp%3BIXsummary%3Dresults%2Fresults%26amp%3BIXsearch%3Dfares%20%26amp%3B_IXFIRST_%3D313 New Tube fares from 21st March, by unknown artist, 1982 London Transport 1982 ] London Bus fares were doubled and London Underground fares increased by 91%. The two central area zones were retained and the fares to all other stations were restructured to be graduated at three mile intervals; and thus grouping those stations within three miles of the central zones in an &apos;inner zone&apos;. In 1983, a third revision of fares was undertaken, and a new inter-modal Travelcard season ticket was launched covering five new numbered zones; representing an overall cut in prices of around 25%. The One Day Travelcard was launched in 1984 and on weekdays was only sold for travel after 09.30. In January 1985 the Capitalcard season ticket was launched, offering validity on British Rail services as well as London Underground and London Buses. It was priced around 10-15% higher than the Travelcard. The card was marketed under the brand &quot; The London Connection &quot;, illustrated with an image of an electric plug bringing together the corporate identities of British Rail and London Transport. In June 1986 the One Day Capitalcard was launched. The Capitalcard brand ended in January 1989 when the Travelcard gained validity on British Rail. In January 1991 Zone 5 was split to create a new Zone 6. In January 2002 a peak version of the One Day Travelcard was introduced on weekdays, which allows travel between 04.30 and 09.30 [ http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/mayors_report/jan23_2002.jsp Eighteenth Report of the Mayor of London to the London Assembly 2002 Mayor of London Greater London Authority ] and in 2005 a 3-day version of the Travelcard was launched (they were discontinued in 2010).

[ http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3959.aspx A faster, easier 7 Day Travelcard on Oyster 2005 Greater London Authority Transport for London ] [ Operation ] A Travelcard entitles the holder to unlimited travel in Greater London on London Buses, Tramlink, London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway and National Rail services. Travelcards are issued for periods of one or seven days, or for any period from one month to one year. They provide travel within six numbered concentric zones, with Zone 1 (which includes the central areas of The City and the West End ) at the middle and Zone 6 (which includes London Heathrow Airport and outlying suburbs such as Uxbridge, Upminster and Orpington ) at the outer edge. On the London Underground, London Overground, DLR and National Rail, the Travelcard is only valid within the zones indicated on the ticket. On London Buses any Travelcard can be used on any route. On Tramlink any Travelcard valid in zones 3, 4, 5, or 6 can be used on any tram route. Travelcards are sold in a limited number of combinations of adjacent zones with different combinations available depending on the length of validity. Travelcards for only one zone are no longer sold, having been withdrawn in 2006. Travelcards valid for travel in Zone 1 (most of central London) are more expensive than those excluding it, [ Tom Masters, Steve Fallon, Vesna Maric London: City Guide Lonely Planet 2008 389 ] although as of 2011 one-day travelcards not including Zone 1 are no longer sold. Travelcards are valid for any journey commencing before 04.30 on the day after it is due to expire. One day Travelcards can be purchased in Anytime and Off-Peak variants. The Anytime Travelcard can be used at any time from 04:30 on the day it becomes valid; and the cheaper Off-Peak Travelcard cannot be used from 04.30 to 09.30 on weekdays. Off-Peak Travelcards are typically 50% cheaper than Anytime Travelcards. Travelcards for seven days or longer are known as season tickets and allow travel at any time of the day. When bought at a London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster Card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days depending on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata monthly rate for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10 month 12 day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10M12D and 1 year, as an annual pass is cheaper and will be issued anyway. [ Services outside Greater London ] { National Rail outlet } There are various services outside Greater London on which Travelcards can be used. These are six Central Line stations in the Epping Forest district of Essex [ Epping Forest District Council http://www.eppingforestdc.gov.uk/community/transport/the_tube.asp London Underground - The Tube ] (and two on the boundary) [ Office of Public Sector Information http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1993/Uksi_19931218_en_1.htm The Essex and Greater London (County and London Borough Boundaries) (No.2) Order 1993 ] that are included in zones 4, 5 and 6; seven Metropolitan Line stations in Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire that are included in local ancillary zones 7, 8 and 9; [ Transport for London http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/lon_con.pdf London Connections Greater London Authority 2008 January ] three London Overground stations in Hertfordshire, included in local ancillary zones 7 and 8; and fourteen National Rail stations just outside Greater London that are included in zones 5 and 6. Additionally, on some London Buses services that cross the Greater London boundary, Travelcards are valid for the whole route.

These include one return journey to and from the edge of the Travelcard area and standard Travelcard validity within the Travelcard Zones. Additionally, National Rail season tickets from outside Greater London can include Travelcard validity within London. [ Exceptions ] Although locally in Zone 6, travel on the BAA rail link to Heathrow Central, Heathrow Terminal 4 and Heathrow Terminal 5 is not included. Watford Junction is served by London Overground but is not within any of the Travelcard zones, yet a special travelcard including the station and zones 1 - 9 is available. Travel on the High Speed rail link between St Pancras and Stratford International is also not included unless the travelcard is &quot; out-boundary &quot; : valid to a station outside London.

A quarterly survey known as the Travelcard Diary Survey is undertaken, where travelcard holders are asked to record all the bus, rail and tube trips they have made using their travelcard. Both &quot; in-boundary &quot; and &quot; out-boundary &quot; (i.e. Travelcards in or outside of the zonal areas) are surveyed, as well as day and monthly, weekly and annual Travelcards. Ensuring that a statistically valid sample that will give a fair and accurate allocation presents a challenge. The average mileage recorded on each mode is then calculated to give allocation factors of the Travelcard revenue to tube, bus and rail. [ Additional benefits ] Travelcards entitle the holder to a 33% discount on scheduled London River Services. In addition, holders of annual travelcards receive a &quot; gold record card &quot; which offers savings on off-peak travel on the same basis as the National Rail annual gold card. { TfL: Gold Cards } { National Rail: Gold Cards } [ See also ] Oyster Card Carte orange similar to Travelcard, used in Île de France Creditrans similar to Travelcard, used in the Greater Bilbao region.
