&apos;&apos;This is a sub-article to Hygiene in Islam, Healthy diet and Food and cooking hygiene. [ August 2007 ] [ Overview ] [ March 2008 ] Islamic jurisprudence specifies which foods are ar DIN ḥalāl ( [ ar حَلَال ] &quot; lawful &quot; ) and which are ar DIN ḥarām ( [ ar حَرَامْ ] &quot; unlawful &quot; ). This is derived from commandments found in the Qur&apos;an, the holy book of [Islam], as well as the Hadith and Sunnah, libraries cataloguing things the Prophet Mohammed is reported to have said and done. Extensions of these rulings are issued, as fatwa s, by Mujtahid s, with varying degrees of strictness, but they are not always widely held to be authoritative. According to the Quran, the only foods explicitly forbidden are meat from animals that die of themselves, blood, the meat of swine (porcine animals, pigs), and animals dedicated to other than Allah (either undedicated or dedicated to idols ), but a person is not guilty of sin in a situation where the lack of any alternative creates an undesired necessity to consume that which is otherwise unlawful. ( Quran 2:173) This is the &quot; law of necessity &quot; in Islamic jurisprudence: &quot; That which is necessary makes the forbidden permissible &quot;, which, in the case of dietary laws, allows one to eat pork or carrion, or drink wine or ethanol if one was starving or dying of thirst (although the Shafi&apos;i madhhab differs on the issue of ethanolic drinks). [ Food hygiene ] Food hygiene is an important part of Islamic dietary law. [ Slaughter ] [ Dhabīḥah ] Dhabīḥah (ذَبِيْحَة)is a prescribed method of ritual animal slaughter; it does not apply to most aquatic animals. The animal must be slaughtered by a Muslim or by one of the People of the Book, generally speaking, a Christian or a Jew, while mentioning the name of God ( Allah in Arabic ). According to some fatwa s, the animal must be slaughtered specifically by a Muslim, however, other fatwas dispute this, ruling that, according to verse 5:5 of the Qur&apos;an, an animal properly slaughtered by People of the Book is halal. Although kosher meat or Jewish meat is slaughtered the same, Muslims cannot eat kosher meat because it&apos;s not blessed by a Muslim so is still considered haram. Other relevant verses in Qur&apos;an include 2:173, 5:3, 5:5, 5:90, 6:118, 6:145, 16:115. Animals for food may not be killed by being boiled or electrocuted, and the carcass should be hung upside down for long enough to be blood-free. [ June 2010 ] All water game is considered halal (although the Hanafi madhhab differs on this): Lawful to you is all water-game, and what the sea brings forth, as a provision for you [who are settled] as well as for travellers, although you are forbidden to hunt on land while you are in the state of pilgrimage. And be conscious of God, unto whom you shall be gathered. Quran 5:96 There are generally no restrictions on the consumption of vegetarian food as the restrictions pertain to slaughter. [ Food certification ] Halal India Due to the recent rise in Muslim populations in the United States and Europe, certain organizations have emerged that certify that food products and ingredients met dhabiha standards. The Muslim Consumer Group is an example of an organization that employs certification labelling, using the H-MCG symbol, to identify the status of different edible and non-edible consumer products. In Islam, Halal is an Arabic term meaning &quot; lawful or permissible &quot; and not only encompasses food and drink, but all matters of daily life. When it comes to halal food, most people think of meat products only. However, Muslims must ensure that all foods, particularly processed foods, pharmaceuticals and non food items like cosmetics are also halal. Often these products contain animal by-products or other ingredients that are not permissible for Muslim consumption. Since 1991, mainstream manufacturers of soups, grains, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, prepared foods, and other industries, as well as hotels, restaurants, airlines, hospitals and other service providers have pursued the halal market. Halal Certification tells Muslims that the ingredients and production methods of a product have been tested and declared permissible by a certification body. It also allows companies to export products to most Middle Eastern countries and South East Asian Countries. The oldest and most well known Halal Certifier in the USA is Islamic Services of America. In Europe, several organizations have been created over the past 20 years in order to certify the halal products. A survey recently published by a French association of Muslim Consumers ( ASIDCOM ) shows that the market of halal products has been developed in a chaotic way in Europe. [ http://www.asidcom.org/spip.php?article86 Survey on the Halal certification agencies (December 2009) ASIDCOM 2010-09-11 ] The European certification organizations do not have a common definition of &quot; halal &quot; nor agreed upon control procedures and traceability. The controls implemented by individual agencies are all very different: it can go from an annual audit of the slaughterhouse to checking each production with permanent controls in place and on-going independent. Some animals and manners of death or preparation can make certain things haram to eat, that is, taboo food and drink. These include what are regarded as unclean animals such as animals that are sick, or have diseases like swine. [ Prohibited food ] [ Alcohol ] In Islam, alcoholic beverage s —or any intoxicant—are generally forbidden in the Qur&apos;an through several separate verses revealed at different times over a period of years. At first, it was forbidden for Muslims to attend to prayers while intoxicated. [ 4 43 ns ] Then a later verse was revealed which said that alcohol contains some good and some evil, but the evil is greater than the good (In Surah Al-Baqarah : 219, it states: [ 2 219 ns ] This was the next step in turning people away from consumption of it. Finally, &quot; intoxicants and games of chance &quot; were called &quot; abominations of Satan &apos;s handiwork, &quot; intended to turn people away from God and forget about prayer, and Muslims were ordered to abstain. [ 5 90 91 ns ] In addition to this, most observant Muslims refrain from consuming food products that contain pure vanilla extract or soy sauce if these food products contain alcohol; there is some debate about whether the prohibition extends to dishes in which the alcohol would be cooked off or if it would be practically impossible to consume enough of the food to become intoxicated. { Alcohol in Islam } { Islam Prohibits Alcohol } The Zaidi and Mutazili sects believe that the use of alcohol has always been forbidden and refer to this Qur&apos;an Ayah (4:43) as feeling of sleepiness and not to be awake. [ Blood ] Blood and its by-products are forbidden in Islam, in the Qu&apos;ran, surah 5 Al-Maeda, verse 3: [ 5 3 ns ] [ Pork ] Consumption of pork and products made from pork is strictly forbidden in Islam. The origin of this belief is derived from the chapter of the Cow (Al Baqara) speaks of this: [ 2 173 ns ] [ See also ] Comparison of Dhabiĥa Halal and kashrut Dietary laws Halal Hechsher Kashrut Makruh Mushbooh Muslim Consumer Group (MCG) Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork [ References ] [ External links ] Laws of Islam concerning food List of probably / possibly Haram Ingredients Is conventional meat Halal/Zabiha?
