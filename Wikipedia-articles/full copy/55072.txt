He ruled as the Xuantong Emperor from 1908 until his abdication on 12 February 1912. From 1 to 12 July 1917 he was briefly restored to the throne as a nominal emperor by the warlord Zhang Xun. In 1934 he was declared the Kangde Emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo by the Empire of Japan, and he ruled until the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945. After the People&apos;s Republic of China was established in 1949, Puyi was a member of the Chinese People&apos;s Political Consultative Conference from 1964 until his death in 1967. Puyi&apos;s abdication in 1912 marked the end of centuries of dynastic rule in China, and he is also widely known as The Last Emperor. [ Names and titles ] [ Names ] Puyi&apos;s name is romanised in English as either Puyi (in pinyin ) or P&apos;u-i (in Wades-Giles ). This naming is in accordance with the Manchu tradition of avoiding the use of a person&apos;s clan name and given name together, [ October 2011 ] but is in complete contravention of Chinese tradition, whereby the given name of a ruler was considered taboo and ineffable. Using a former emperor&apos;s personal name (or even using a Chinese character from the name) was a punishable offence under traditional Chinese law. However after Puyi lost his imperial title in 1924, he was officially styled Mr. Puyi ( [ 溥儀先生 溥仪先生 Pǔyí Xiānshēng ] ) in Chinese and Mr. Fugi (溥儀先生; Fugi Sensei) in Japanese. His clan name Aisin Gioro ( [ 愛新覺羅 爱新觉罗 Àixīn Juéluó ] ) was seldom used. Puyi also adopted Chinese style name s  — his zi (字; courtesy name) was Yaozhi ( [ 耀之 Yàozhī ] ), and his hao (號; pseudonym) was Haoran ( [ 浩然 Hàorán ] ). Puyi is also known to have used a Western given name, Henry ¹, which was chosen by his English language teacher, a Scotsman named Reginald Johnston. { Pu Yi. 1988, p 113 } [ Titles ] When he ruled as Emperor of the Qing Dynasty from 1908 to 1912 and during his brief restoration in 1917, Puyi&apos;s era name was Xuantong, so he was known as the Xuantong Emperor ( [ 宣統皇帝 宣统皇帝 Xuāntǒng Huángdì ] ) during those two periods of time. As Puyi was also the last ruling Emperor of China, he is widely known as The Last Emperor ( [ 末代皇帝 Mòdài Huángdì ] ) in China and throughout the rest of the world. Some refer to him as The Last Emperor of the Qing Dynasty ( [ 清末帝 Qīng Mò Dì ] ). Due to his abdication, Puyi is also known as Xun Di ( [ 遜帝 逊帝 Xùn Dì Yielded Emperor ] ) or Fei Di ( [ 廢帝 废帝 Fèi Dì Abrogated Emperor ] ). Sometimes a Qing ( [ 清 Qīng ] ) is added in front of the two titles to indicate his affiliation with the Qing Dynasty. When Puyi ruled the puppet state of Manchukuo from 1934 to 1945, his era name was Kangde, so he was known as the Kangde Emperor ( [ 康德皇帝 Kāngdé Huángdì ] ) during that period of time.

The Guangxu Emperor died without an heir. [ Joseph William A Politics in China: An Introduction 2010 Oxford University Press, USA 978-0-19-533531-6 45 ] Puyi, who succeeded the Guangxu Emperor, was the eldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, who was born to Yixuan, Prince Chun and his second concubine Lady Lingiya (1866–1925). Lady Lingiya used to be a maid in the residence of Yixuan. Born a Han Chinese, her original family name was Liu (劉), and this was changed to the Manchu clan name Lingiya when she became the concubine of Yixuan. Zaifeng was therefore a younger half-brother of the Guangxu Emperor and the first in line to succession after Guangxu.

Cixi&apos;s niece, who later became Empress Dowager Longyu (1868–1913), was married to the Guangxu Emperor.

Ronglu was one of the leaders of the conservative faction in the Qing court, and a staunch supporter of Empress Dowager Cixi; Cixi rewarded his support by marrying his daughter, Puyi&apos;s mother, into the imperial family. The Guwalgiya clan was regarded as one of the most powerful Manchu clans in the Qing Dynasty.

Titled the Xuantong Emperor, Puyi&apos;s introduction to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up. [ Behr Edward The Last Emperor 1998 Futura 63, 80 978-0-7088-3439-8 ] His father, Prince Chun, became Prince-Regent (摄政王). During Puyi&apos;s coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the young emperor was carried onto the throne by his father. Puyi was so frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music that he started crying. His father could do nothing except to quietly comfort him, &quot; Don&apos;t cry, it&apos;ll be over soon. &quot; Puyi&apos;s wet nurse, Wen-Chao Wang, was the only one who could console him, and therefore she accompanied him to the Forbidden City. Puyi did not see his biological mother, Princess Consort Chun, for the next seven years. He developed a special bond with Wen-Chao Wang and credited her with being the only person who could control him. She was sent away when he was eight years old. After Puyi married, he would occasionally bring her to the Forbidden City, and later Manchukuo, to visit him. After his special government pardon in 1959, he visited her adopted son and only then learned of her personal sacrifices to be his nurse. { Pu Yi 1988, pp 70-76 } Puyi&apos;s upbringing was hardly conducive to the raising of a healthy, well-balanced child. Overnight, he was treated as a god and unable to behave as a child. The adults in his life, except for his wet-nurse Wen-Chao Wang, were all strangers, remote, distant, and unable to discipline him. Wherever he went, grown men would kneel down in a ritual kowtow, averting their eyes until he passed. Soon the young Puyi discovered the absolute power he wielded over the eunuchs, and he frequently had them beaten for small transgressions.

They waited on me when I ate, dressed and slept; they accompanied me on my walks and to my lessons; they told me stories; and had rewards and beatings from me, but they never left my presence. They were my slaves; and they were my earliest teachers. ] After his marriage, Puyi began to take control of the palace. He described &quot; an orgy of looting &quot; taking place that involved &quot; everyone from the highest to the lowest &quot;. According to Puyi, by the end of his wedding ceremony, the pearls and jade in the empress&apos;s crown had been stolen. { Pu Yi 1988, p 132 } Locks were broken, areas ransacked, and on June 27, 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness. Puyi suspected it was arson to cover theft. The emperor overheard conversations among the eunuchs that made him fear for his life. In response, he evicted the eunuchs from the palace. { Pu Yi 1988, p 136 } His next plan of action was to reform the Household Department; the officials of which he appointed became so wealthy from theft and graft that they were able to run their own businesses outside the palace. { Pu Yi 1988, pp 137-142 } [ Abdication ] Puyi&apos;s father, Prince Chun, served as a regent until 6 December 1911 when Empress Dowager Longyu took over in the face of the Xinhai Revolution. Empress Dowager Longyu endorsed the &quot; Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor &quot; (清帝退位詔書) on 12 February 1912, following the Xinhai Revolution, under a deal brokered by Yuan Shikai (a general of the Beiyang Army ) with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China.

This was similar to Italy&apos;s Law of Guarantees (1870) which accorded the Pope certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the King of Italy.

A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver tael s was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. [ The Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after his Abdication ] The document is dated 26 December 1914. { Twilight in the Forbidden City, 1934, } { Reginald Fleming Johnston, pp 96-98 } After the abdication of the Great Qing Emperor, his title of dignity is to be retained by the Republic of China with the courtesies which it is customary to accord to foreign monarchs. After the abdication of the Great Qing Emperor, he will receive from the Republic of China an annual subsidy of 4,000,000 silver tael s. After the reform of the currency this amount will be altered to $4,000,000 (max.). After the abdication of the Great Qing Emperor, he may, as a temporary measure, continue to reside in the Palace (in the Forbidden City ), but afterwards he will remove himself to the Summer Palace. He may retain his bodyguard. After the abdication of the Great Qing Emperor, the temples and mausoleums of the imperial family with their appropriate sacrificial rites shall be maintained in perpetuity. The Republic of China will be responsible for the provision of military guards for their adequate protection. As the Chong Mausoleum (崇陵) of the late Emperor Dezong (the Guangxu Emperor ) has not yet been completed, the work will be carried out according to the proper regulations (relating to imperial tombs). The last ceremonies of sepulture will also be observed in accordance with the ancient rites. The actual expenses will all be borne by the Republic of China. The services of all the persons of various grades hitherto employed in the Palace may be retained; but in future no eunuchs are to be added to the staff. After the abdication of the Great Qing Emperor, his private property will be safeguarded and protected by the Republic of China. The imperial guard corps as constituted at the time of the abdication will be placed under the military control of the War Office of the Republic of China. It will be maintained at its original strength and will receive the same emoluments as heretofore.

During that period of time, a small bomb was dropped over the Forbidden City by a Republican plane, causing minor damage. { Stone of Heaven, Levy, Scott-Clark p 184 } This is considered the first aerial bombardment ever in East Asia. The restoration failed due to extensive opposition across China, and the decisive intervention of another warlord, Duan Qirui. [ Bangsbo Jens Reilly Thomas Williams A.

[ Rogaski Ruth Hygienic Modernity: Meanings of Health and Disease in Treaty-Port China 2004 University of California Press 978-0-520-24001-8 262 ] During this period, Puyi and his advisers Chen Baochen, Zheng Xiaoxu and Luo Zhenyu discussed plans to restore Puyi as Emperor. Zheng and Luo favoured enlisting assistance from external parties, while Chen opposed the idea. In September 1931 Puyi sent a letter to Jirō Minami, the Japanese Minister of War, expressing his desire to be restored to the throne. He was visited by Kenji Doihara, head of the espionage office of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who proposed establishing Puyi as head of a Manchurian state. In November 1931, Puyi and Zheng Xiaoxu traveled to Manchuria to complete plans for the puppet state of Manchukuo. The Chinese government ordered Puyi&apos;s arrest for treason, but was unable to breach the Japanese protection. Chen Baochen returned to Beijing where he died in 1935.

On 1 March 1932, Puyi was installed by the Japanese as the ruler of Manchukuo, considered by most historians as a puppet state of the Empire of Japan, under the reign title Datong (大同). In 1934, he was officially crowned the emperor of Manchukuo under the reign title Kangde (康德). He was constantly at odds with the Japanese in private, though submissive in public. He resented being &quot; Head of State &quot; and then &quot; Emperor of Manchukuo &quot; rather than being fully restored as a Qing Emperor. Puyi lived in a palace (now the Museum of the Imperial Palace of the Manchu State ) in this period. At his enthronement he clashed with Japan over dress; they wanted him to wear a Manchukuo-style uniform whereas he considered it an insult to wear anything but traditional Manchu robes. In a typical compromise, he wore a Western military uniform to his enthronement { Pu Yi 1988, p 275 } (the only Chinese emperor ever to do so) and a dragon robe to the announcement of his accession at the Temple of Heaven. { Pu Yi 1988, p 276 } Puyi&apos;s younger full brother Pujie, who married Lady Hiro Saga, a distant cousin to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito, was proclaimed heir apparent. The marriage had been politically arranged by Shigeru Honjō, a general of the Kwantung Army. Puyi thereafter would not speak candidly in front of his brother and refused to eat any food provided by Hiro Saga. Puyi was forced to sign an agreement that if he himself had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised by the Japanese. { Pu Yi 1988, p 288-290 } { Chū Kudō. } From 1935 to 1945 Kwantung Army senior staff officer Yoshioka Yasunori (吉岡安則) [ Yasunori Yoshioka, Lieutenant-General (1890–1947) http://www.generals.dk/general/Yoshioka/Yasunori/Japan.html The Generals of WWII  — Generals from Japan Steen Ammentorp, Librarian DB., M.L.I.Sc. 17 August 2010 ] was assigned to Puyi as Attaché to the Imperial Household in Manchukuo. He acted as a spy for the Japanese government, controlling Puyi through fear, intimidation, and direct orders. { Pu Yi 1988, p 284-320 } There were many attempts on Puyi&apos;s life during this period, including a 1937 stabbing by a palace servant. During Puyi&apos;s reign as Emperor of Manchukuo, his household was closely watched by the Japanese, who increasingly took steps toward the full Japanisation of Manchuria, to prevent him from becoming too independent. He was feted by the Japanese populace during his visits there, but had to remain subservient to Emperor Hirohito. { Pu Yi 1988, p 281 } It is unclear whether the adoption of ancient Chinese styles and rites, such as using &quot; His Majesty &quot; instead of his real name, was the product of Puyi&apos;s interest or a Japanese imposition of their own imperial house rules. During these years, Puyi began taking a greater interest in traditional Chinese law and religion { Pu Yi 1988, p 307 } (such as Confucianism and Buddhism ), but this was disallowed by the Japanese. Gradually his old supporters were eliminated and pro-Japanese ministers put in their place. { Pu Yi 1988, p 298 } During this period Puyi&apos;s life consisted mostly of signing laws prepared by Japan, reciting prayers, consulting oracles, and making formal visits throughout his state.

Puyi came to Peking in 1959 with special permission from Chairman Mao Zedong and lived the next six months in an ordinary Peking residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Peking Botanical Gardens.

Wenxiu (1909–1953), married Puyi in 1922, was his Consort Shu (淑妃). Tan Yuling (1920–1942), married Puyi in 1937, was his Concubine Xiang (祥貴人).

Quotation of Puyi (referring to only the first four wives): { Pu Yi 1988, p 310 } [..they were not real wives and were only there for show ] In detail In 1921, it was decided by the Dowager Consorts (the four widows of the emperors before Puyi) that it was time for the 15 year old Puyi to be married, although court politics dragged the complete process (from selecting the bride, up through the wedding ceremony) out for almost two years. Puyi saw marriage as his coming of age benchmark, when others would no longer control him. He was given four photographs to choose from. Puyi stated they all looked alike to him, with the exception of different clothing. He chose Wenxiu. Political factions within the palace made the actual choice as to whom Puyi would marry. The selection process alone took an entire year. { Pu Yi 1988, pp 117-118 } [ Wanrong ] Puyi&apos;s second choice for his wife was Wanrong, a Daur. She married Puyi in 1922 and became his Empress. Her father, Rong Yuan (榮源), was a Minister of Domestic Affairs. She was considered beautiful and came from a wealthy family. By Puyi&apos;s own account, he abandoned Wanrong in the bridal chamber and went back to his own room. { Pu Yi 1988, pp 117-121 } He maintained that she was willing to be a wife in name only, in order to carry the title of Empress. The couple&apos;s relationship was good initially, and Puyi showed preference over Wenxiu for Wanrong and displayed trust in her. However after Wenxiu left in 1931, Puyi blamed Wanrong and stopped speaking to her and ignored her presence. She became addicted to opium, and eventually died in a prison in Yanji, Jilin after being arrested by Chinese Communist soldiers. [ Lee Lily Xaio Hong Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women: The Twentieth Century 1912-2000 2003 M.E. Sharpe 978-0-7656-0798-0 373–375 ] [ Wenxiu ] Puyi&apos;s first choice for his wife was Wenxiu, from the Erdet (鄂爾德特) clan. She married Puyi in 1922. Although she was Puyi&apos;s first choice, the Four Dowager Consorts felt that Wenxiu came from an unacceptable impoverished family and was not beautiful enough to be Empress, so they told the court officials to ask Puyi to choose again. The second time Puyi chose Wanrong, who became Empress, while Wenxiu was designated as Consort Shu (淑妃). Puyi and Wenxiu divorced in 1931. Puyi awarded her a house in Beijing and $300,000 in alimony, to be provided by the Japanese. In his autobiography, Puyi stated her reason for the divorce was the emptiness of life with him in exile, her desire for an ordinary family life, and his own inability to see women as anything but slaves and tools of men. Puyi related that she never re-married, became a primary school teacher, and died in 1953. { Pu Yi 1988, pp 213,214 } [ Tan Yuling ] Puyi&apos;s third wife, Tan Yuling, was a Manchu of the Tatara (他他拉) clan. She married Puyi in 1937 at the age of 16 on the recommendation of the daughter of Yulang (毓朗), a beile. She was designated as Puyi&apos;s Concubine Xiang (祥貴人). Puyi married her as &quot; punishment &quot; for Wanrong, and, &quot;...because a second wife was as essential as palace furniture. &quot; She was also a wife in name only. She became ill in 1942 with typhoid, which the Japanese doctor said would not be fatal. After the doctor&apos;s consultation with Attaché to the Imperial Household Yasunori Yoshioka, Tan Yuling suddenly died. Puyi became suspicious of the circumstances when the Japanese immediately offered him photographs of Japanese girls for marriage. { Pu Yi 1988, pp 310-311 } Puyi posthumously granted her the title Noble Consort Mingxian (明賢貴妃). [ Li Yuqin ] In 1943 Puyi married his fourth wife, a 15-year-old student named Li Yuqin, who was a Han Chinese from Changchun, Jilin. She was designated as Puyi&apos;s Concubine Fu (福貴人). { Pu Yi 1988, p 312 } In February 1943, school principal Kobayashi and teacher Fujii of the Nan-Ling Girls Academy took ten girl students to a photography studio for portraits. Three weeks later, the school teacher and the principal visited Li Yuqin&apos;s home and told her Puyi ordered her to go to the Manchukuo palace to study. She was first taken directly to Yasunori Yoshioka who thoroughly questioned her. Yoshioka then drove her back to her parents and told them Puyi ordered her to study at the palace. Money was promised to the parents. She was subjected to a medical examination and then taken to Puyi&apos;s sister Yunhe and instructed in palace protocol. [ Yu-Ning Li Chinese Women Through Chinese Eyes 1992 M.E. Sharpe 978-0-87332-596-7 228–250 ] Two years later when Manchukuo collapsed, Li Yuqin shared a train with Empress Wanrong, who was experiencing opium withdrawal symptoms at the time. They were both arrested by the Soviets and sent to a prison in Changchun. Li Yuqin was released in 1946 and sent back home. She worked in a textile factory while she studied the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. In 1955 she began visiting Puyi in prison. After applying to the Chinese authorities for a divorce, the government responded on her next prison visit by showing her to a room with a double bed and ordered her to reconcile with Puyi, and she said the couple obeyed the order. She divorced Puyi in May 1957. She later married a technician, and had two sons. [ Li Yuqin obit The Telegraph UK 30 April 2001 ] During the Cultural Revolution she became a target for attack by the Red Guards because she used to be Puyi&apos;s concubine. She died of liver problems in 2001. [ Li Shuxian ] In 1962 under the arrangement of Zhou Enlai, Puyi married his fifth and last wife, Li Shuxian, a nurse of Han Chinese ethnicity. They had no children. She died of lung cancer in 1997. Li Shuxian recounted that they dated for six months before the marriage, and she found him to be, &quot;...a man who desperately needed my love and was ready to give me as much love as he could. &quot; [ Scott-Clark Cathy The Stone of Heaven: Unearthing the Secret History of Imperial Green Jade 2002 Phoenix 978-0-7538-1329-4 Levy, Adrian 356 ] [ Bibliography ] [ By Puyi ] [ 我的前半生 The First Half of My Life; From Emperor to Citizen: The Autobiography of Aisin-Gioro Puyi Aisin-Gioro Puyi 1964, 1987, 2002 Foreign Languages Press 978-7-119-00772-4 ] [ The Last Manchu: The Autobiography of Henry Pu Yi, Last Emperor of China Pu Yi Henry Skyhorse Publishing 1967, 2010 978-1-60239-732-3 ]  – original  – translation [ By others ] [ Headland Isaac Taylor Court life in China 1909 F.H.
