The nearest towns are Scone, Singleton, Dungog, Gloucester and East Gresford. The Park is part of the Barrington Tops Area of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

[ http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm IBA: Barrington Tops &amp; Gloucester Tops 2011-05-19 Birdata Birds Australia ] [ Environment ] [ Geology ] Barrington Tops is part of the Mount Royal Range, a spur of the Great Dividing Range. Barrington Tops is a plateau between two of the large peaks in the range, The park is believed to be an extinct volcano and the mountain ranges are made up of a mixture of sedimentary rocks with a granite top. Erosion has weathered the granite and rounded granite boulders can be seen in some areas of the park. Estimates put the age of the rock at 300 to 400 million years, well before Australia separated from Gondwana. [ Climate ] { Barrington River } The climate varies from temperate on the lower altitudes to subalpine at highest elevations. A record low of [ -17 °C °F 0 on ] has been registered at [ 1500 m ft on ] above mean sea level. {.Zoete, T.

Australian Journal of Botany 34, 293-304. } [ Flora ] The ecology of the national park varies from subtropical rainforest s in the gullies to subalpine and alpine regions on the mountain peaks. Snow usually falls on the mountain peaks every year and occasionally snows enough to close roads. Rainfall can exceed [ 1500 mm in 0 on ] per annum. A large variety of plants and animals reside in the park and the steepness of the terrain ensures that they are not disturbed by humans. Plant life includes a large variety of eucalypt trees including Snow Gums, subtropical and temperate rainforest trees like Antarctic Beech, tree ferns, a large variety of moss es and fern s and a wide range of edible plants such as the native raspberry, the native cherry and the Lilli Pilli. [ Fauna ] { echidna on a walking trail } The remoteness and inaccessibility of a large part of the park has allowed some of the more sensitive animals to remain largely undisturbed. A large number of fauna have been catalogued in the park including some that were previously thought to be extinct. Some of the more common animals include: Barking and Sooty Owls, Eastern Grey Kangaroo s, frog s, pademelon s, cockatoo s, rosella s, kookaburra s, bat s and Echidna s. It supports a globally important population of Rufous Scrub-bird s, as well as Flame Robin s, Pale-yellow Robin s, Paradise Riflebird s, Green Catbird s, Regent Bowerbird s and Australian Logrunner s. Animals such as quoll s, native rats and Platypus reclusive but they may be seen. Not all of the animals in the park are desirable; introduced species such as feral horse s and feral cat s are being removed.

[ Barrington Guest House ] { Barrington River } The Barrington Guest House was built from 1925 on the upper Williams River near Barrington Tops by Norman T.
