Many of its tactics of &quot; Project C &quot; were developed by Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, Executive Director of SCLC from 1960–64. Based on actions in Birmingham, Alabama, its goal was to end the city&apos;s segregated civil and discriminatory economic policies. The campaign lasted for more than two months in the spring of 1963. To provoke the police into filling the city&apos;s jails to overflowing, King and black citizens of Birmingham employed nonviolent tactics to flout laws they considered unfair. King summarized the philosophy of the Birmingham campaign when he said, &quot; The purpose of  ... direct action is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation &quot;. { Garrow, (1986) p.  246. } Protests in Birmingham began with a boycott to pressure businesses to offer sales jobs and other employment to people of all races, as well as to end segregated facilities in the stores. When business leaders resisted the boycott, King and the SCLC began what they termed Project C, a series of sit-in s and marches intended to provoke arrest. After the campaign ran low on adult volunteers, SCLC&apos;s strategist, James Bevel, initiated the action and recruited the children for what became known as the &quot; Children&apos;s Crusade &quot;. During the protests, the Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene &quot; Bull &quot; Connor, used high-pressure water jets and police dogs to control protesters, including children. Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm&apos;s way. By the end of the campaign, King&apos;s reputation improved immensely, Connor lost his job, the &quot; Jim Crow &quot; signs in Birmingham came down, and public places became more open to blacks.

Bloody Sunday was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement, the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King&apos;s nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present. King met with officials in the Johnson administration on March 5 in order to request an injunction against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, &quot; If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line. &quot; [ 276–9 ] Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.
