After being gang-raped by some upper- caste members of her village, Phoolan Devi turned a bandit, and authorised the killing of 22 upper-caste villagers in 1981. Following this, she became notorious across India as a bandit. Some people believe that most of her crimes were committed seeking justice for women&apos;s suffering, particularly those in the unfortunate lowest castes; however, the Indian authorities consider this a myth. She was once falsely imprisoned for seeking those involved in her rape to be tried for their crimes. Then made a martyr for exacting this revenge independently from authority and as part of a gang.

The 1994 film Bandit Queen was loosely based on her life.

Thomson Living Media India Ltd., 2001 } Phoolan&apos;s father owned an acre (0.4 hectare) of land with a huge Neem tree on it. He hoped that the valuable timber of the tree would enable him to pay dowry for his daughters&apos; marriages.

He took over the inheritance by deceit, leaving Phoolan&apos;s family to remain in poverty. Her Uncle had a son, Mayadin. He cut down the Neem tree and sold the wood, intending to keep the proceeds for himself. [ Insurgents, Raiders, and Bandits John Arquilla Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2011 9781566638326 245–251 ] Although her father submitted with mild protest, Phoolan confronted her cousin. She taunted him, publicly called him a thief and attacked him. With her elder sister, she staged a sit-in on his land. Even after violence against Phoolan — knocking her out with a brick — she wouldn&apos;t relent. In an effort to rid himself of the little nuisance, Mayadin arranged to have her married to a man named Putti Lal, who lived several hundred miles away. Putti Lal was in his thirties; Phoolan was eleven. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1456441.stm Phoolan Devi: Champion of the poor 2001-07-25 2006-12-11 BBC News ] Devi claimed in her autobiography that he was a man of &quot; very bad character &quot;. Phoolan&apos;s husband raped and mistreated her, which was agonising for her to endure,particularly due to her age and isolation. She ranaway several times, and would be returned to her husband for severe punishment. She was returned to her village, being deemed too young to fulfill her duties as a wife. Three years later in 1977, she was returned back to Putti Lal&apos;s home. She protested, and was returned back to her father&apos;s home. A wife leaving her husband was a serious taboo in the rural areas, and Phoolan was marked as a social outcast. Phoolan continued to challenge her cousin Mayadin, accusing him of thievery. She took him to court for unlawfully holding her father&apos;s land, but lost the case. In 1979, Mayadin accused Phoolan of stealing small items from his house, and arranged for her arrest by the police. During the three days in jail, she was beaten and raped by the authorities. She blamed her cousin for the injustice, and developed hatred for men who routinely denigrated women. When released from prison, she was further shunned by her village and her family. Justice was elusive and she felt hurt by her helplessness.. [ As a dacoit ] In 1979, a gang of dacoit s abducted Phoolan; some also say that she was not kidnapped but &quot; walked away from her life &quot;. The gang leader, Babu Gujjar, who was a Gujjar, wanted to rape her. However, she was protected by Vikram Mallah, the second-in-command of the gang who belonged to Phoolan&apos;s caste. One night when Babu attempted to rape Phoolan, Vikram killed him and assumed the gang leadership. Phoolan fell in love with this man who had undoubtedly protected her, and became Vikram&apos;s second wife. The gang ransacked the village where Phoolan&apos;s husband lived. Phoolan stabbed her estranged husband, and dragged him in front of the villagers. The gang left him lying almost dead by the road, with a note as a warning for older men who marry young girls. Phoolan Devi learned how to use a rifle from Vikram, and participated in the gang&apos;s activities across Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The activities consisted of ransacking high-caste villages, kidnapping upper-caste landowners for ransom and train robberies. After every crime, Phoolan Devi would visit a Durga temple and thank the goddess for her protection.

[ Behmai incidents ] Sometime later, Shri Ram and Lala Ram, two upper-caste dacoit brothers belonging to the Thakur caste, returned to the gang. They were outraged by the killing of the gang leader by a low caste gang member. Shri Ram would make sexual advances towards Phoolan. This led to tensions between Shri Ram and Vikram, who made him apologize to Phoolan. When the gang would ransack a village, Shri Ram would beat and insult the Mallahs. This displeased the Mallahs in the gang, many of whom left the gang. When Shri Ram got a dozen Thakurs to join the gang, Vikram suggested the gang be divided into two, but Shri Ram refused. Shortly afterwards, Shri Ram and other Thakur members in the gang attempted to kill Phoolan and Vikram, who managed to escape. However, later they successfully killed Vikram, abducted Phoolan and locked her up in the Behmai village. Phoolan Devi was beaten and raped by several men in Behmai. After three weeks, she managed to escape with two other Mallahs from Vikram&apos;s gang, helped by a low-caste villager. She gathered a gang of Mallahs, that she led with Man Singh, a member of Vikram&apos;s former gang. The gang carried out a series of violent robberies in north and central India, mainly targeting upper-caste people. Some say that Phoolan Devi targeted only the upper-caste people and shared the loot with the lower-caste people, but the Indian authorities insist this is a myth. [ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1456441.stm Phoolan Devi: Champion of the poor 2001-07-25 2006-12-11 BBC News ] Seventeen months after her escape from Behmai, Phoolan returned to the village, to take her revenge. On 14 February 1981, Phoolan and her gang marched into the Behmai village, dressed as police officers. The Thakurs in the village were preparing for a wedding. Phoolan&apos;s gang demanded that her kidnappers be produced, along with all the valuables in the village. Details of what exactly happened are not available, but Phoolan is said to have recognized two men who earlier had sexually assaulted her and murdered her lover. When Phoolan&apos;s gang failed to find all the kidnappers after an exhaustive search, she ordered her gang members to line up all the upper-caste Thakur men in the village and shoot them. The dacoits opened fire and killed twenty-two Thakur men, most of whom were not involved in her kidnapping or rape. Later, Phoolan Devi claimed that she herself didn&apos;t kill anybody in Behmai – all the killings were carried out by her gang members. The Behmai massacre was followed by a massive police manhunt that failed to locate Phoolan Devi. V. P. Singh, the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, resigned in the wake of the Behmai killings.

Dolls of Phoolan Devi dressed as Hindu goddess Durga were sold in market towns in Uttar Pradesh. She was glorified by much of the Indian media. [ Surrender and jail term ] Two years after the Behmai massacre the police had still not captured Phoolan Devi. The Indira Gandhi Government decided to negotiate a surrender. By this time, Phoolan Devi was in poor health and most of her gang members were dead. In February 1983, she agreed to surrender to the authorities. However, she said that she didn&apos;t trust the Uttar Pradesh police and insisted that she would only surrender to the Madhya Pradesh Police. She also insisted that she would lay down her arms only before Mahatma Gandhi &apos;s picture and the Hindu goddess Durga, not to the police.

They walked their way to Bhind, where she laid her rifle before the portraits of Gandhi and Goddess Durga. The onlookers included a crowd of around 10,000 people and 300 police and the then chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Arjun Singh. 300 police personnel were waiting to arrest her and other members of her gang who surrendered at the same time. Phoolan Devi was charged with 48 crimes, including 30 charges of dacoity (banditry) and kidnapping. Her trial was delayed for 11 years, which she served in the prison. During this period, she was operated on for ovarian cyst s and ended up with an involuntary hysterectomy. She was finally released on parole in 1994 after persuasion by Vishambhar Prasad Nishad, the leader of the Nishadha fishermen community. The Government of Uttar Pradesh, led by Mulayam Singh Yadav, withdrew all the cases against her. [ Movie and autobiography ] Shekhar Kapur made a movie Bandit Queen (1994) about Phoolan Devi&apos;s life up to her 1983 surrender, based on Mala Sen&apos;s India’s Bandit Queen: The True Story of Phoolan Devi. [ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/8546445/Mala-Sen.html Obituaries: Mala Sen The Telegraph 2011-05-30 2011-11-28 ] Although Phoolan Devi is a heroine in the film, she fiercely disputed its accuracy and fought to get it banned in India. She even threatened to immolate herself outside a theater if the film were not withdrawn. Eventually, she withdrew her objections after the producer Channel 4 paid her £40,000. The film brought her international recognition. Author-activist Arundhati Roy in her film review titled, &apos;The Great Indian Rape Trick&apos;, questioned the right to &quot; restage the rape of a living woman without her permission, &quot; and charged Shekhar Kapur with exploiting Phoolan Devi and misrepresenting both her life and its meaning. { The Great Indian Rape-Trick @ SAWNET -The South Asian Women&apos;s NETwork, Retrieved 25 November 2011 } Though she was illiterate, Phoolan composed her autobiography titled The Bandit Queen of India: An Indian Woman&apos;s Amazing Journey From Peasant to International Legend, with help of two international authors, Marie-Therese Cuny and Paul Rambali. { The Bandit Queen of India: An Indian Woman&apos;s Amazing Journey from Peasant to International Legend @ Amazon.com, Retrieved 25 November 2011 } [ Political career ] In the 1990s, Phoolan Devi served as the president of Eklavya Sena, an organization formed by the Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ganga Charan Rajput to &quot; protect the weaker sections &quot;. [ Indian democracy derailed politics and politicians Srikanta Ghosh APH Publishing 1997 978-81-7024-866-8 145 ] Under Phoolan&apos;s leadership, the group aimed at teaching lower-caste people the art of self-defense. During this period, Phoolan married Umaid Singh, her sister&apos;s husband and a New Delhi business contractor. In 1996, Phoolan Devi contested for the 11th Lok Sabha from Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh as a Samajwadi Party candidate and was elected. She was re-elected to the 13th Lok Sabha in 1999.

Kshatriya Swabhimaan Andolan Samanvay Committee (KSASC), a Kshatriya organization, held a statewide campaign to protest against her. In a 1999 interview, she stated that her political objectives included providing drinking water, electricity, schools and hospitals to the poor. She also emphasized on equal status for women, stressing on their education and employment. [ http://www.kyotojournal.org/gender/devi.shtml 1999 Interview with Catherine Pawasarat of Kyoto Journal Kyotojournal.org 2012-02-02 ] During her career as a Member of the Indian Parliament, Phoolan got a train stopped at unscheduled stops to meet her acquaintances in Uttar Pradesh. The railway minister, Ram Vilas Paswan played down the train incident and ordered only a nominal enquiry. Once, she visited the Gwalior jail (where she had been imprisoned) to meet her former inmates. When the jail officers didn&apos;t let her in due to the visiting hours rules, she abused them. Later, a suspension order was issued against the jail officials involved in the incident, without any explanation. In 1998, Phoolan Devi claimed she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by some members of the British Parliament.

[ Assassination ] On 25 July 2001, Phoolan Devi was fatally shot as she got out of her car at the gate of her New Delhi residence. The assailants also wounded her bodyguard and escaped in an auto rickshaw. Sher Singh Rana, Dheeraj Rana, and Rajbir were accused of the crime. Sher Singh Rana allegedly surrendered in Dehradun. He confessed to the murder, saying he was avenging the deaths of 22 Kshatriya s at Behmai. He escaped from Tihar Jail in 2004 to reclaim the relics of Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan, from his grave in Afghanistan to his nation “India”, and were highly disrespected by Afghans, [ http://rajputanas.com/rajput-history/sher-singh-rana-biography/ Sher Singh Rana biography Rajputanas 2012-01-25 2012-02-02 ] but was captured in April 2006 from Kolkata and sent to Rohini Jail, Delhi. The same year, the KSASC decided to honor Rana for &quot; upholding the dignity of the Kshatriya community &quot; and &quot; drying the tears of the widows of Behmai &quot;. On 19 January 2007, Balender Singh, Phoolan&apos;s bodyguard who had been witness to the shooting, identified Dheeraj and Sher Singh as the people who had fired on him and Phoolan respectively. Balender Singh was cross-examined on 2 February 2007.
