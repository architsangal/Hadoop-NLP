The population was 4,098 at the 2000 census. It was founded in 1714. Eastford was a part of Ashford until 1848 or 1847, when the former split off to organize its own town. For this reason North Ashford is located in northeast Eastford. Ashford is home to the largest Boy Scout camp in Connecticut, June Norcross Webster Scout Reservation and Paul Newman &apos;s Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. Boston Hollow, a deep ravine, is also in Ashford. [ History ] President George Washington, returning from his tour of the country in the fall of 1789, was chagrined to be involuntarily abandoned in the village on a Sunday. It was contrary to law to hire a conveyance on that day, which was observed by villagers, to Washington&apos;s great annoyance.
