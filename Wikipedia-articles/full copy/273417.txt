It was under full Bulgarian control from 1885 on, when it willingly united with the tributary Principality of Bulgaria after a bloodless revolution. Ethnic Bulgarians composed the absolute demographic majority within Eastern Rumelia. Its capital was Plovdiv (Ottoman: Filibe, Greek: Philippopolis). Today, Eastern Rumelia (the largest part of Northern Thrace ) is part of Bulgaria. [ History ] Eastern Rumelia was created as an autonomous province within the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. It encompassed the territory between the Balkan Mountains, the Rhodope Mountains and Strandzha, a region known to all its inhabitants Bulgarians, Ottoman Turks, Roma, Greeks, Armenians and Jews as Northern Thrace. The artificial { Balkan studies: biannual publication of the Institute for Balkan Studies, Volume 19, 1978, p.235 } name, Eastern Rumelia, was given to the province on the insistence of the British delegates to the Congress of Berlin : the Ottoman notion of Rumelia refers to all European regions of the empire, i.e. those that were in Antiquity under the Roman Empire. Some twenty Pomak ( Bulgarian Muslim ) villages in the Rhodope Mountains refused to recognize Eastern Rumelian authority and formed the so-called Republic of Tamrash. The province is remembered today by philatelists for having issued postage stamp s from 1880 on. See the main article, Postage stamps and postal history of Eastern Rumelia. [ Unification with Bulgaria ] After a bloodless revolution on 6 September 1885, the province was annexed by the tributary Principality of Bulgaria. After the Bulgarian victory in the subsequent Serbo-Bulgarian War, the status quo was recognized by the Porte with the Tophane Agreement on 24 March 1886. With the Tophane Act, Sultan Abdul Hamid II appointed the Prince of Bulgaria (without mentioning the name of the incumbent prince Alexander of Bulgaria ) as Governor-General of Eastern Rumelia, thus retaining the formal distinction between the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia { Emerson M. S. Niou, Peter C. Ordeshook, Gregory F. Rose. The balance of power: stability in international systems, 1989, p. 279. } and preserving the letter of the Berlin Treaty. { Stanley Leathes, G. W. (George Walter) Prothero, Sir Adolphus William Ward. The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 2, 1908, p. 408. } However, it was clear to the Great Powers that the union between the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia was permanent, and not to be dissolved. { Charles Jelavich, Barbara Jelavich. The establishment of the Balkan national states, 1804-1920, 2000, p. 167. } The Republic of Tamrash and the region of Kardzhali were reincorporated in the Ottoman Empire. The province was nominally under Ottoman suzerainty until Bulgaria became de jure independent in 1908. 6 September, Unification Day, is a national holiday in Bulgaria. [ Government ] { Balkans by the German-English cartographer } { E. G. Ravenstein in 1870. } According to the Treaty of Berlin, Eastern Rumelia was to remain under the political and military jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire with significant administrative autonomy (Article 13). The law frame of Eastern Rumelia was defined with the Organic Statute which was adopted on 14 April 1879 and was in force until the Unification with Bulgaria in 1885. According to the Organic Statute the head of the province was a Christian Governor-General appointed by the Sublime Porte with the approval of the Great Powers. The legislative organ was a Provincial Counsel which consisted of 56 persons, of which 10 were appointed by the Governor-General, 10 were permanent and 36 were directly elected by the people. Eastern Rumelia consisted of the departments (департаменти, departamenti; in Ottoman terminology sanjaks, in Bulgarian области oblasti) of Plovdiv (Filibe), Pazardzhik (Tatarpazarcığı), Haskovo (Hasköy), Stara Zagora (Eski Zağra), Sliven (İslimye) and Burgas (Burgaz), in turn divided into cantons (equivalent to Ottoman kazas, Bulgarian околии okolii).

The second Governor-General was Gavril Krastevich (1884–1885), a famous Bulgarian historian. Before the first Governor-General, Arkady Stolypin was the Russian Civil Administrator from 9 October 1878 to 18 May 1879. During the period of Bulgarian annexation Georgi Stranski was appointed as a Commissioner for South Bugaria (9 September 1885 - 5 April 1886), and when the province was restored to nominal Ottoman sovereignty, but still under Bulgarian control, the Prince of Bulgaria was recognized by the Sublime Porte as the Governor-General.

The earliest information on the ethnic demographics of Eastern Rumelia, before the first census was conducted, comes from ethnographic maps of the Balkans by Western cartographers. There is little information on the actual population numbers of the different ethnic groups before 1878. According to a British report before the 1877–1878 war, the non-Muslim population (which were mostly Bulgarians) of Eastern Rumelia, was about 60% which proportion grew due to the flight and emigration of Muslims during and after the war. { Studies on Ottoman social and political history: selected articles and essay, Kemal H. Karpat, p.370 } The results of the first Regional Assembly elections of 17 October 1879 show a predominantly Bulgarian character: Of the 36 elected deputies, 31 were Bulgarians (86.1%), 3 were Greeks (8.3%) and two were Turks (5.6%). { Делев, &quot; Княжество България и Източна Румелия &quot;, История и цивилизация за 11. клас. } The ethnic statistics from the censuses of 1880 and 1884 show a Bulgarian majority in the province.

The repetition of the census in 1884 returned similar data: 70.0% Bulgarians, 20.6% Turks, 2.8% Roma and 6.7% others. The ethnic composition of the population of Eastern Rumelia as of 1884, according to the provincial census, was the following: [ https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id%3D429995%26amp%3BSite%3DCOE 6.1 European population committee (CDPO) Council of Europe II.

Property abandoned by Muslims fleeing the Russian army during the 1877–1878 war was appropriated by the local population. The former owners, mostly large landholders, were threatened with trial by military court if they had committed crimes during the war, so that they would not return. Two Turkish landowners who did return were in fact sentenced to death thus preventing others from desiring to come back. Those Turkish landowners who were not able to take possession of their land were financially compensated, with the funds collected by the Bulgarian peasants, some of whom were indebted as a result. For those who did return a 10% property tax was issued, forcing many to sell off their property in order to pay the tax. { Jelavich, p. 164. } { The Balkans since 1453; Leften Stavros Stavrianos, Traian Stoianovich; p. 442 } According to Michael Palairet, land rights of Muslim owners were largely disregarded despite of being guaranteed by the powers and de-Ottomanization of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia led to the economic decline in the region. { Palairet, Michael R., &quot; The Balkan Economies C.1800-1914: Evolution Without Development &quot;, 1997 pp.174-202 } The Greek inhabitants of Eastern Rumelia were concentrated on the coast, where they were strong in numbers, { A Short History of Russia and the Balkan States, Donald Mackenzie Wallace, 1914, p.102 } and certain cities in the interior such as Plovdiv, where they formed a substantial minority. Most of the Greek population of the region was exchanged with Bulgarians from the Greek provinces of Macedonia and Thrace in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars and World War I. Today, there are about 1400 Greeks in Bulgaria, { http://www.nsi.bg/Census_e/Ethnos.htm } as well as about 4200 Karakachans ( Sarakatsani ). { http://www.nccedi.government.bg/save_pdf.php?id=247 } [ References ] [ История и цивилизация за 11. клас Делев Петър Валери Кацунов, Пламен Митев, Евгения Калинова, Искра Баева, Боян Добрев 2006 Bulgarian Труд, Сирма ] [ External links ] Map, map, map [ Vassals ] [ June 2011 ] Category:History of Bulgaria Category:Former countries in the Balkans Category:Former Slavic countries Category:States and territories established in 1878 Category:Ottoman Thrace Category:Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire ar:الروملي الشرقية bg:Източна Румелия cs:Východní Rumélie de:Ostrumelien el:Ανατολική Ρωμυλία es:Rumelia Oriental fr:Roumélie orientale hr:Istočna Rumelija it:Rumelia orientale he:רומליה המזרחית ka:აღმოსავლეთი რუმელია hu:Kelet-Rumélia mk:Источна Румелија nl:Oost-Roemelië ja:東ルメリ自治州 pl:Rumelia Wschodnia pt:Rumélia Oriental ro:Rumelia Orientală ru:Восточная Румелия sr:Источна Румелија sh:Istočna Rumelija sv:Östrumelien tr:Doğu Rumeli uk:Східна Румелія zh:東魯米利亞
