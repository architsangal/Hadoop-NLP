Daniel Jackson is first introduced in the 1994 film Stargate, and is played by James Spader. In the ensuing television series the character is played by Michael Shanks. Daniel Jackson is a civilian archeologist and linguist, who works with the Stargate military project and therefore holds no military ranking. After the kidnapping of his wife Sha&apos;re in &quot; Children of the Gods &quot;, Jackson joins SG-1 to rescue her. Shanks left the series in season 6, which led to the introduction of Corin Nemec &apos;s character, Jonas Quinn, as a replacement. Jackson was a recurring character throughout season 6, and resumed being a main character in season 7 after Shanks and the Stargate producers worked out a new contract. Jackson also appears in Stargate: The Ark of Truth, Stargate: Continuum and several episodes of Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe. [ Character arc ] Born on July 8, 1965, Daniel Jackson is the only child of Melburn and Claire Jackson, archaeologists who were crushed while supervising the placement of a piece of Egyptian art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

However, he finds little acceptance there of his theory that the Pyramids of Giza are much older than they are thought to be. An aged woman named Catherine Langford approaches him to offer him a job deciphering the cover-stones of a device found in Egypt. Jackson uses his knowledge of ancient Egypt ian languages to make the device, named the Stargate, function.
