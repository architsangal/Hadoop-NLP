The population was 24,729 at the 2010 census. [ http://factfinder2.census.gov Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Belmont town, Middlesex County, Massachusetts U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder April 5, 2012 ] [ History ] Belmont was founded on March 18, 1859, by former citizens of, and land from the bordering towns of Watertown, to the south; Waltham, to the west; and Arlington, then known as West Cambridge, to the north. The town was named after Bellmont, the 200 acre (0.8  km²) estate of one of the leading advocates of and largest donor to its creation, John Perkins Cushing. The easternmost section of the town, including the western portion of Fresh Pond, was annexed by Cambridge in 1880 { (17) } in a dispute over a slaughterhouse licensed in 1878 { Belmont Historic District Commission, Belmont, Massachusetts: The Architecture and Development of The Town of Homes, 1984 } on Fresh Pond, so that Cambridge could protect Fresh Pond, a part of its municipal water system. Much of that area is now a major commercial and office center for the city of Cambridge. Preceding its incorporation, Belmont was an agrarian based town, with several large farms servicing Boston for produce and livestock. It remained largely the same until the turn of the twentieth century, when trolley service and better roads were introduced, making the town more attractive as a residential area, most notably for the building of large estates. Belmont&apos;s population grew by over 90 percent during the 1920s. { Schaeffer, K. H. and Elliott Sclar. Access for All: Transportation and Urban Growth. } { Columbia University Press, 1980. Accessed on } { Google Books. 86. Retrieved on January 16, 2010. ISBN 0-231-05165-4, ISBN 978-0-231-05165-1. } The economics of the town shifted from purely agrarian to a commercial greenhouse base: much of the flower and vegetable needs of Boston were met from the Belmont &apos;hothouses&apos; which persisted until about 1983 when Edgar&apos;s, the last large greenhouse firm in the area, closed [ February 2007 ]. Other commercial enterprises in Belmont included mining and waste management. The reclamation of a large dump and quarry off Concord Avenue into sites for the Belmont High School and the Clay Pit Pond stands as a lasting example of environmental planning. With the introduction of automobile s and highway s Belmont continued its transition to a commuter-based suburb throughout the twentieth century. Belmont was the home of the headquarters of the John Birch Society from the organization&apos;s founding in 1958 until its relocation to Appleton, Wisconsin in 1989. [ Present day ] Belmont remains a primarily residential suburb with little growth since the 1950s. It is best known for the mansion-filled Belmont Hill neighborhood, although most residents live in more densely settled, low-lying areas around the Hill. There are three major commercial centers in the town: Belmont Center in the center, Cushing Square in the south, and Waverley Square in the west. Town Hall and other civic buildings are located in Belmont Center. Large tracts of land from former farms and greenhouse estates form public or public-accessible areas such as Rock Meadow, Habitat ( Mass Audubon ), portions of the McLean Hospital tract and various town fields. The major roads in the town are Concord Avenue, which bisects the town from east to west, Common Street and Pleasant Street (Route 60) which travel north-south through Belmont, and Trapelo Road and Belmont Street which run along the southern edge of the town. Massachusetts Route 2 runs along the northern border of the town. Belmont is also served by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority &apos;s Fitchburg Commuter Rail line and MBTA Bus line numbers 62, 62/76, 67, 72/75, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 84, and 554. The town is home to McLean Hospital, a psychiatric hospital and research center, and the Boston Massachusetts Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

[ Education ] Belmont is served by the Belmont Public Schools, governed by an independently elected school committee. { http://town.belmont.ma.us/Public_Documents/BelmontMA_WebDocs/govt } There are four public elementary schools in Belmont, the Mary Lee Burbank, Daniel Butler, Winn Brook, and Roger Wellington schools. Two other public elementary schools, Payson Park and Kendall, were closed in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. The former closed after being destroyed by fire, the latter closed due to population shifts and was converted to an arts center, which was later also destroyed by fire. There is one public middle school, the Winthrop L. Chenery Middle School, which was rebuilt on the same location after an electrical fire damaged the auditorium in 1995, and one public high school, Belmont High School. Belmont High has an outstanding reputation for college placement, strong athletics, academics, music, and theater arts; a typical class size of about 290 students; and average SATs for the class of 2004 of 1179. Belmont students also have the option to attend Minuteman Career and Technical High School in Lexington. Minuteman High also offers adult education courses. In 2009, US News and World Reports gave Belmont High School a gold medal and named it the 100th best non-private high school in the United States and the second best in the state of Massachusetts. Belmont Hill School is a private, non-sectarian all-male high school, grades 7-12. Belmont Day School is a private, non-sectarian PK-8 school. There are several smaller private schools. [ Government ] The executive branch of the town government consists of a three-person Board of Selectmen elected by the residents. The Selectmen appoint a Town Administrator who is in charge of daily operations. The legislative branch is a representative town meeting, with eight districts each electing 36 representatives, plus ex-officio members and a Town Moderator to run the annual meeting. Belmont is part of the 24th Middlesex District (for the Massachusetts House of Representatives ), the 2nd Middlesex and Suffolk District (for the Massachusetts Senate ), and Massachusetts&apos;s 7th congressional district (for the United States House of Representatives ). [ Transportation ] Belmont is served directly by two state routes. Running close to the middle of town is Route 60, locally known as Pleasant Street. On the northern border, Route 2 predominantly outlines Belmont&apos;s boundary with the neighboring town of Arlington. Other nearby major routes include I-95 / MA-Route 128, Route 16, Route 3, and Route 20. Several MBTA bus routes serve Belmont directly: 72/75 — Belmont Center - Harvard Station via Concord Ave. Saturday and Sunday service ( map schedule ) 73 — Waverley Square - Harvard Station via Trapelo Road (trolleybus) ( map schedule ) 74 &amp; 75 — Belmont Center - Harvard Station via Concord Ave. Monday through Saturday service, see 72/75 for Sunday service ( map ) 78 — Arlmont Village - Harvard Station via Park Circle ( map schedule ) 554 — Downtown Boston - Waverley Square via Newton Corner ( map schedule ) These MBTA bus routes have stops in Belmont along the Route 2 corridor (eastbound): 62 — Bedford V.A. Hospital - Alewife Station, Monday through Friday service ( map schedule ) 62/76 — Bedford V.A. Hospital, Lincoln Labs, and Hanscom - Alewife Station, Saturday service ( map schedule ) 67 — Turkey Hill - Alewife Station ( map schedule ) 76 — Hanscom and Lincoln Labs - Alewife Station, Monday through Friday service ( map schedule ) 84 — Arlmont Village - Alewife Station ( map schedule ) Two rail stations— Waverley and Belmont Center on the MBTA Commuter Rail —are located in the town. Belmont is roughly sixteen minutes away from the rail line &apos;s terminus at North Station, Boston. Nearby in Cambridge lies Alewife Station, the western terminus of the Red Line; providing a connection to Boston and the entire metropolitan rapid transit system. [ Railroad history ] Boston &amp; Maine Railroad Station at Belmont Center Belmont was once served by two railroads, the Fitchburg Railroad and the Central Massachusetts Railroad, both of which were later to become part of the Boston &amp; Maine system. Originally the two railroads had their own tracks through town, but in 1952 the Central Mass tracks were lifted between Hill&apos;s Crossing and Clematis Brook (Waltham). { The Rail Lines of Southern New England - Ronald Dale Karr 1995 } Traffic was then rerouted over the Fitchburg Line. Today the MBTA owns the trackage that runs through Belmont. It is known Fitchburg Route. Passenger service on this line currently ends at Fitchburg, but it once was the area&apos;s main route into New York state. As of 2011, the MBTA was planning to extend future service to West Fitchburg. Wellington Hill Station The station stops at Belmont Center and Waverley were once grade crossings, meaning pedestrian and vehicular traffic had to cross directly over rails that were in public roads. In 1907 the grade at Belmont Center was eliminated by constructing a stone bridge to carry the tracks past a new station building. At Waverley, the grade was lowered so that the tracks ran under Trapelo Road. A second railroad station building exists in Belmont, though it is not obvious. The Wellington Hill Station was originally built in the 1840s as a private school, not far from its current location. It was then used by the Fitchburg Railroad from 1852-1879. When the railroad decided to replace the station with a larger structure, the building was moved to the Underwood Estate and used as a summer house. In 1974, the station was donated to the Belmont Historical Society. It was restored and relocated to its current location in 1980. [ Environment ] In 2002, Middlesex County was ranked in the worst 10% of polluted counties in the United States in terms of air and water pollution. { http://scorecard.goodguide.com/community/who.tcl?fips_county_code=25017 &amp; name=MIDDLESEX &amp; zip_code=02478 } Two companies that ranked in the top 10 for polluters in the county were Cambridge Plating Company in Belmont and the Polaroid Corporation in Waltham. The chemicals released were trichloroethylene and dichloromethane, both of which are harmful and have been shown to cause cancer. These chemicals are released into the air so it is difficult to trace them and to determine the source as there are also several other industries in the area that release the same pollutants. It is estimated that 3% of homes in Belmont are at risk of having lead hazards. [ December 2011 ] In 2004, the town of Belmont first hosted an annual community environmental fair to encourage environmentally friendly behavior for its residents { http://www.town.belmont.ma.us/Public_Documents/F0001046A/townlinks/envfair. } [ Notable residents ] { Hartwell and Richardson } A recent photograph Due to its proximity to Harvard and MIT universities, amongst others, Belmont has had several Nobel Prize winners in residence at one time or another { http://belmont.patch.com/articles/belmont-famous-nobel-prize-winner-next-door }.
