He is an inventor of the heterotransistor and the winner of 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics. He is also a Russian politician and has been a member of the Russian State Parliament, the Duma, since 1995. Lately, he has become one of the most influential members of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. [ Birth and education ] Alferov was born in Vitebsk, Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union to a Belarusian father and a Jewish mother. [ Алферов, Жорес http://lenta.ru/lib/14177331/full.htm Lenta Russian 24 December 2007 2008-06-26 ] In 1952 he graduated from V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin) Electrotechnical Institute in Leningrad. Since 1953 he has worked in the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences. From the Institute he earned several scientific degrees: a Candidate of Sciences in Technology in 1961 and a Doctor of Sciences in Physics and Mathematics in 1970. He has been director of the Institute since 1987. He was elected a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1972, and a full member in 1979. From 1989 he has been Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Sciences and President of its Saint Petersburg Scientific Center. Since 1995 he is a member of the State Duma on the list of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. He received 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Herbert Kroemer, &quot; for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and optoelectronics &quot;. Alferov invented the heterotransistor. This coped with much higher frequencies than its predecessors, and apparently revolutionised the mobile phone and satellite communications. Alverov and Kroemer independently applied this technology to firing laser lights. This in turn revolutionised semiconductor design in a host of areas, including LEDs, barcodes readers and CDs. Hermann Grimmeiss, of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards Nobel prizes, said: &quot; Without Alferov, it would not be possible to transfer all the information from satellites down to the Earth or to have so many telephone lines between cities. &quot; [ Staff writers Russian and Americans share hi-tech Nobel http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/965528.stm BBC News 10 October 2000 2008-06-26 ] [ Research area ] Since 1962 he has been working in the area of semiconductor heterostructures. His contributions to physics and technology of semiconductor heterostructures, especially investigations of injection properties, development of laser s, solar cell s, LED &apos;s, and epitaxy processes have led to the creation of modern heterostructure physics and electronics. He has an almost messianic conception of heterostructures, writing: &quot; Many scientists have contributed to this remarkable progress, which not only determines in large measure the future prospects of solid state physics, but in a certain sense affects the future of human society as well. { Lib.semi.ac.cn } [ Political activity ] { Vladimir Putin } Alferov was elected to the Russian State Parliament, the Duma in 1995 as a deputy for the political party Our Home is Russia, generally considered to be supportive of the policies of President Boris Yeltsin. In 1999 he was elected again, this time on the list of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. He was re-elected in 2003 and again in 2007, when he was placed second on the party&apos;s federal electoral list behind Gennady Zyuganov and ahead of Nikolai Kharitonov, even though he is not a member of the party. { Communists, Patriots Name Their Leaders, Kommersant, Sep. 07, 2007 } He was one of the signers of the Open letter to the President Vladimir V. Putin from the Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences against clericalisation of Russia. [ Non-profit service ] Alferov serves on the advisory council of CRDF Global. [ Dr. Zhores I.
