Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. &quot; Cherokee County. &quot; } [ History ] According to a gazeteer, Cherokee County was established in 1907. { Columbia-Lippincott Gazeteer. p. 386 } However, the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, states that it was created from the Talequah District of the Cherokee Nation in 1906. The Cherokees began moving into this area during the 1830s as a result of the forced emigration from their previous lands. The first significant settlements were at the site of Park Hill, where there was already a mission community, and Talequah, which became the seat of Cherokee government. However the Civil War divided the tribe and caused many of the early structures to be destroyed. Non-Indians began moving into the area illegally, starting in the mid 1870s, and became the majority by the 1890s. In 1851, the Cherokee Male Seminary opened in Talequah and the Cherokee Female Seminary opened in Park Hill. The latter burned down in 1887 and was rebuit in Talequah. A 1910 fire destroyed the Male Seminary. The Female became Northeastern State Normal School after statehood in 1907 and is now part of Northeastern State University. During 1901 – 1903, The Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway, which later became part of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway was the first to build a track in the county. It boosted the shipment of farm products through the 1920s, but declined during the Great Depression. All rail service ceased in 1942. [ Geography ] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of [ 776 sqmi 1 ], of which [ 751 sqmi 1 ] is land and [ 25 sqmi 1 ] (3.27%) is water. The county lies in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains. It includes most of Tenkiller Lake and part of Fort Gibson Lake. The principal river running through it is the Illinois River. Grand River (Oklahoma) forms part of its western boundary. [ Economy ] Since statehood, the economy of Cherokee County has been based on agriculture, especially production of corn, wheat and vegetables. However, the percentage of the population engaged in farming has declined from 62 percent in 1940 to 4.4 percent in 1990. This is largely due to increased urbanization around Talequah since World War II. Agriculture remains very important. In 2002, this county ranked first in Oklahoma for the value of nursery and greenhouse crops and seventh in the state for poultry and eggs. Major non-agricultural employers in the county now include the Cherokee Nation government and Northeastern State University, [ Major highways ] 20px U.S. Highway 62 20px State Highway 10 20px State Highway 51 20px State Highway 82 [ Adjacent counties ] Delaware County (north) Adair County (east) Sequoyah County (south) Muskogee County (southwest) Wagoner County (west) Mayes County (northwest) [ Demographics ] Age pyramid for Cherokee County, Oklahoma, based on census 2000 data.
