H.H. Russell, the first postmaster, took the name Roslyn from his native city in Scotland,” { Roslyn Diamond Jubilee, p. 1 } although a Norwegian name would have been more appropriate as most of the European settlers in the area were from Norway. “In 1914, the Soo Line Railroad ( Fairmount and Veblen Railway ) was being built in the area. In order to secure the line for the community, settlers adjoining the proposed line raised $60,000. The coming of the railroad led to the selection of a new town site. On August 17, 1914, the New Roslyn was plotted and Main Street was established.” Old Roslyn was eventually abandoned.
