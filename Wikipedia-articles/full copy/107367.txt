Mark Twain based his short story &quot; The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County &quot; on a story he claimed he heard at the Angels Hotel in 1865. The event is commemorated with a Jumping Frog Jubilee each May at the Calaveras County Fairgrounds, just east of the city. Because of this, Angels Camp is sometimes referred to as &quot; Frogtown. &quot; United States Ski Team member and two time Alpine skiing World Cup Downhill Champion Kyle Rasmussen lives in Angels Camp. The city is California Historical Landmark #287. [ History ] { National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). } Henry and George Angel were soldiers serving under John C. Frémont during the Mexican-American War. When the California Gold Rush started, they tried their hand at prospecting, but decided they didn&apos;t like the labor involved, so they set up a trading post, which became a camp, and eventually a town. The placers around their camp were very productive but gave out after a few years, and the population began to dwindle until gold-bearing quartz veins were discovered in the town, which brought people back. Those mines operated for the next few decades, producing over $20 million worth of gold, processed by stamp mills in town. It was said that when the last mill finally ceased operations, the townspeople couldn&apos;t sleep, the silence was so loud.
