Note the Yield sign } A traffic circle or rotary is a type of intersection that has a generally circular central island. Entering traffic must typically alter direction and speed to avoid the island, creating a circular flow in one direction. In most applications, traffic circles replace the stop lights and traffic signs that regulate flow in other intersections. In English-speaking countries other than the United States, circular junctions or intersections are typically in the form of roundabout s which give priority to circulating traffic and which are physically designed to slow traffic entering the junction to improve safety, so that the roads typically approach the junction radially; whereas rotaries are frequently designed to try to increase speeds, and thus have roads that enter the traffic circle tangentially. In the U.S., traffic engineers use the term roundabout for intersections in which entering traffic must yield to traffic already in the circle, reserving the term traffic circle for those in which entering traffic is controlled by stop signs, traffic signals, or is not formally controlled. { U.S. Department of Transportation: &apos;&apos;Roundabouts: an Informational Guide&apos;&apos; para 1.5 } [ 3 ] [ Design ] Design criteria include: [ http://www.mass.gov/rmv/dmanual/index.htm Sharing the Road: A User&apos;s Manual for Public Ways Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Registry of Motor Vehicles 2009-05-13 ] http://www.safeny.com/rowa-vt.htm#1145 {, entering traffic yields, as is the norm in virtually all countries outside of the U.S. } { Angle of entry — Angles range from glancing ( } { tangent ial ) that allow full-speed entry to 90 degree angles ( } { perpendicular ). &apos;&apos;Modern Roundabouts, an Informational Guide&apos;&apos; } { Traffic speed —High entry speeds (over 30 mph / 50 km/h) require circulating vehicles to yield, often stopping, which lowers capacity and increases crash rates than } { modern roundabout s. } [ http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3734/is_200703/ai_n18755716/pg_1 A Comparative Evaluation of the Safety Performance of Roundabouts and Traditional Intersection Controls Shashi S.

M. Wolf, Eugene Henard and the Beginning of Urbanism in Paris, 1900–1914, International Federation for Housing and Planning, The Hague, 1969, cited by Ben Hamilton-Baillie &amp; Phil Jones, Improving traffic behaviour and safety through urban design, Proceedings of ICE – Civil Engineering, volume 158 Issue 5 May 2005 p. 41 http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/papers/ICE_paper_April05.pdf } American architect William Phelps Eno favored small traffic circles. He designed New York City&apos;s famous Columbus Circle, which was built in 1905. Other circular intersections were subsequently built in the United States, though many were large diameter &apos; rotaries &apos; that enabled high speed merge and weave maneuvers. These designs were doomed to failure for two primary reasons: [ March 2011 ] It takes a large diameter circle to provide enough room for merging at speed. Although some of these circles were huge (many were in excess of 100 meters or 300 feet in diameter), they weren&apos;t large enough for high-speed merging. Giving priority to entering traffic means that more vehicles can enter the circulatory roadway than it can handle. The result is congestion within the circle which could not clear without police intervention. The experience with traffic circles and rotaries in the US was almost entirely negative, [ March 2011 ] characterized by high accident rates and congestion problems. By the mid 1950s, construction of traffic circles and rotaries had ceased entirely. The experience with traffic circles in other countries was not much better until the development of the modern roundabout in the United Kingdom during the 1960s.
