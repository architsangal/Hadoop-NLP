The story concerns a reunion in a crumbling Broadway theatre, scheduled for demolition, of the past performers of the &quot; Weismann&apos;s Follies, &quot; a musical revue (based on the Ziegfeld Follies ), that played in that theatre between the World Wars. It focuses on two couples, Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone, who are attending the reunion. Sally and Phyllis were showgirls in the Follies. Both couples are deeply unhappy with their marriages. Buddy, a traveling salesman, is having an affair with a girl on the road; Sally is still as much in love with Ben as she was years ago; and Ben is so self-absorbed that Phyllis feels emotionally abandoned. Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers, sometimes accompanied by the ghosts of their former selves. The Broadway production opened on April 4, 1971, directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett, and with choreography by Bennett. The musical was nominated for eleven Tony Award s and won seven. The original production, which ultimately lost money, ran for 522 performances. The piece has enjoyed a number of major revivals, and several of its songs have become standards, including &quot; Broadway Baby &quot;, &quot; I&apos;m Still Here &quot;, &quot; Too Many Mornings &quot;, &quot; Could I Leave You? &quot;, and &quot; Losing My Mind &quot;. [ Background ] After the failure of Do I Hear A Waltz? (1965), for which he had written the lyrics to Richard Rodgers &apos;s music, Sondheim decided that he would henceforth work only on projects where he could write both the music and lyrics himself. He asked author and playwright James Goldman to join him as bookwriter for a new musical. Inspired by a New York Times article about a gathering of former showgirls from the Ziegfeld Follies, they decided upon a story about ex-showgirls. { Chapin, pp. xxii–xxvi, 7 } Originally titled The Girls Upstairs, the musical was originally to be produced by David Merrick and Leland Hayward in late 1967, but the plans ultimately fell through, and Stuart Ostrow became the producer, with Joseph Hardy to direct. These plans also did not work out, { Citron, Stephen. &apos;&apos;Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical&apos;&apos;, &quot; Chapter:Prince and Company &quot;. Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: The New Musical, Oxford University Press US, 2001, ISBN 0-19-509601-0, pp.159-160 } and finally Harold Prince, who had worked previously with Sondheim, became the producer and director. He had agreed to work on The Girls Upstairs if Sondheim would agree to work on Company; Michael Bennett, the young choreographer of Company, was also brought onto the project. It was Prince who changed the title to Follies; he was &quot; intrigued by the psychology of a reunion of old chorus dancers and loved the play on the word &apos;follies&apos; &quot;. [ Plot ] On the soon-to-be demolished stage of the Weismann Theatre, a reunion is being held to honor Weismann&apos;s &quot; Follies &quot; shows past, and the beautiful chorus girls who once performed there. The once resplendent theatre is now little but planks and scaffolding (Prologue/Overture). As the ghosts of the young showgirls slowly drift through the theatre, a majordomo enters with his entourage of waiters and waitresses. They pass through the spectral showgirls without seeing them. Sally Durant Plummer, &quot; blond, petite, sweet-faced &quot; and at 49 &quot; still remarkably like the girl she was thirty years ago &quot;, { Sondheim, Stephen, and Goldman, James. &quot; Act 1 &quot; Follies. Theatre Communications Group, 2001, ISBN 978-1-55936-196-5, pp. 2-3, 71 } a former Weismann girl is the first guest to arrive; her ghostly youthful counterpart moves towards her. Phyllis Rogers Stone, a stylish and elegant woman, even more attractive now, also arrives with her handsome and successful husband, Ben. As their younger counterparts approach them, Phyllis comments to Ben about their past. He feigns disinterest; there is an underlying tension in their relationship. As more guests arrive, Sally’s husband, Buddy, enters. He is a salesman, in his early 50s, appealing and lively, whose smiles cover inner disappointment. Finally Mr. Weismann enters to greet his guests. Roscoe, the old master of ceremonies, introduces the former showgirls ( &quot; Beautiful Girls &quot; ). Former Weismann performers at the reunion include Max and Stella Deems, who lost their radio jobs and became store owners in Miami; Solange La Fitte, a coquette, who is still vibrant three decades later; Hattie Walker, who has outlived five younger husbands; Vincent and Vanessa, former dancers who now own an Arthur Murray franchise; Heidi Schiller, for whom Franz Lehár once wrote a waltz (or was it Oscar Straus ?); and Carlotta Campion, a film star who has embraced life and benefited from every experience. As the guests reminisce, the stories of Ben, Phyllis, Buddy and Sally unfold. Phyllis and Sally were roommates while in the Follies, and Ben and Buddy were best friends at school in New York. When Sally sees Ben, her former lover, she greets him self-consciously ( &quot; Don&apos;t Look at Me &quot; ). Carlotta is tired of listening to everyone&apos;s stories and wants someone to listen to her. Meanwhile, Buddy and Phyllis join their spouses and the foursome reminisces about the old days of their courtship and the theatre, their memories vividly coming to life in the apparitions of their young counterparts ( &quot; Waiting For The Girls Upstairs &quot; ). Each of the four is shaken at the realization of how life has changed them. Elsewhere, Willy Wheeler (portly, in his sixties) cartwheels for a photographer. Emily and Theodore Whitman, ex-vaudevillians in their seventies, perform an old routine ( &quot; The Rain on the Roof &quot; ). Solange proves she is still fashionable at 66 ( &quot; Ah, Paris! &quot; ), and Hattie Walker performs her old showstopping number ( &quot; Broadway Baby &quot; ). Sally is awed by Ben’s apparently glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how things might have been ( &quot; The Road You Didn&apos;t Take &quot; ). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, in a &quot; harrowing account of a lonely, middle-aged suburban woman&apos;s self-delusions &quot;, { Rich, Frank. &quot; Stage: Concert Version Of &apos;Follies&apos; Is A Reunion &quot;. The New York Times, September 9, 1985, p. C16 } trying to convince him (and herself) ( &quot; In Buddy’s Eyes &quot; ). But it is clear that Sally is still in love with Ben – even though she was terribly hurt when Ben chose to marry Phyllis. Sally felt used for his sexual satisfaction. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside. Phyllis interrupts this tender moment and has a biting encounter with Sally. But this confrontation is interrupted by another performance – this time, the ex-chorines line up to perform an old number ( &quot; Who&apos;s That Woman? &quot; ), with disastrous results, as they are mirrored by their younger selves. Afterward, Phyllis and Ben angrily discuss their lives and relationship, which has become numb and emotionless. Sally is bitter and has never been happy with Buddy, although he has always adored her. Carlotta amuses everyone with a tale of how her dramatic solo was cut from the Follies because the audience found it humorous, but somehow the number works when she sings it today ( &quot; I&apos;m Still Here &quot; ). Ben confides to Sally that his life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips between them and the three move together ( &quot; Too Many Mornings &quot; ). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy enters. Buddy is furious, and Ben, startled by the parallel between present and past, tells Sally it was over long ago. He leaves Sally still dreaming of a marriage that will never happen. Buddy angrily fantasizes about the girl he should have married, who would have loved him and made him feel like &quot; a somebody &quot; ( &quot; The Right Girl &quot; ). Sally tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he&apos;s already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs &quot; One More Kiss &quot;, her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter but confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that she cannot return to their loveless marriage. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request ( &quot; Could I Leave You? &quot; ). The two couples and their young counterparts argue furiously about how foolish they were when they were young. Suddenly, at the peak of madness and confusion, the couples are engulfed by their follies, which transform the rundown theatre into a fantastical &quot; Loveland &quot;, an extravaganza even more grand and opulent than the gaudiest Weismann confection: &quot; the place where lovers are always young and beautiful, and everyone lives only for love &quot;. { &quot; Synopsis &quot; mtishows.com. Retrieved August 30, 2010. } Sally, Phyllis, Ben and Buddy show their &quot; real and emotional lives &quot; in &quot; a sort of group nervous breakdown. &quot; { Sondheim, p. 231 } Young Phyllis and Young Ben have hopes for the future ( &quot; You&apos;re Gonna Love Tomorrow &quot; ), as do Young Buddy and Young Sally ( &quot; Love Will See Us Through &quot; ). Buddy then appears, dressed in &quot; plaid baggy pants, garish jacket and a shiny derby hat &quot;, in a vaudeville routine with an imaginary Sally and his old girlfriend Margie ( &quot; The God-Why-Don&apos;t-You-Love-Me Blues &quot; ). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer ( &quot; Losing My Mind &quot; ). Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, &quot; juicy &quot; Lucy — the young Phyllis, naive but passionate, and &quot; dressy &quot; Jessie — Phyllis&apos;s jaded, well-groomed present self ( &quot; The Story of Lucy and Jessie &quot; ). Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy ( &quot; Live, Laugh, Love &quot; ), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis. &quot; Loveland &quot; has dissolved back into the reality of the crumbling and half-demolished theatre; dawn is approaching. Buddy escorts the &quot; emotionally devastated &quot; Sally, while Phyllis helps Ben regain his dignity before they leave, all with the promise to work things out later. Their ghostly younger selves finally enter the light. The younger Ben and Buddy softly call to their &quot; girls upstairs &quot;, and the Follies end.

[ Analysis ] Hal Prince said: &quot; Follies examines obsessive behavior, neurosis and self-indulgence more microscopically than anything I know of. &quot; { Hirsch, Foster. &quot; A little Sondheim music &quot;. Harold Prince and the American Musical Theatre, CUP Archive, 1989, ISBN 0-521-33609-0, p. 95 } Bernadette Peters quoted Sondheim on the character of &quot; Sally &quot; : &quot; He said early on that [Sally] is off balance, to put it mildly. He thinks she’s very neurotic, and she is very neurotic, so he said to me, &apos;Congratulations. She’s crazy.&apos; &quot; { Gamerman, Ellen. &quot; Bernadette Peters on ‘Follies’ and Puppies &quot; The Wall Street Journal, September 3, 2011 } Martin Gottfried wrote: &quot; The concept behind &apos;Follies&apos; is theater nostalgia, representing the rose-colored glasses through which we face the fact of age... the show is conceived in ghostliness. At its very start, ghosts of Follies showgirls stalk the stage, mythic giants in winged, feathered, black and white opulence. Similarly, ghosts of Twenties shows slip through the evening as the characters try desperately to regain their youth through re-creations of their performances and inane theater sentiments of their past. &quot; { Gottfried, Martin.

The emotional high generated by the reunion of the Follies girls ultimately give way to anger, disappointment, and a weary resignation to reality. &quot; { Gordon, Joanne. &quot; The Art of Illusion &quot; Stephen Sondheim: A Casebook (1999), Taylor &amp; Francis, ISBN 0-8153-3586-5, pp. 109-110 } &quot; Follies contains two scores: the Follies pastiche numbers and the book numbers. &quot; { &quot; &apos;Follies&apos; analysis and summary &quot; sondheim.com.

How Sondheim Found His Sound (2007). University of Michigan Press. ISBN 978-0-472-03229-7. p.105 } Sondheim noted that the song &quot; The God-Why-Don&apos;t-You-Love-Me Blues &quot; is &quot; another generic pastiche: vaudeville music for chases and low comics, but with a patter lyric...I tried to give it the sardonic knowingness of Lorenz Hart or Frank Loesser. &quot; { Sondheim, p. 235 } &quot; Loveland &quot;, the final musical sequence, (that &quot; consumed the last half-hour of the original &quot; production { Kirkeby, Marc (released April 1971). &quot; Liner notes to original Broadway cast recording. &quot; Follies (p. 14).

EMI Records, Ltd. } ) is akin to a 1920s Ziegfeld Follies sequence, with Sally, Phyllis, Ben and Buddy performing &quot; like comics and torch singers from a Broadway of yore. &quot; &quot; Loveland &quot; features a string of vaudeville -style numbers, reflecting the leading characters&apos; emotional problems, before returning to the theatre for the end of the reunion party. The four characters are &quot; whisked into a dream show in which each acts out his or her own principal &apos;folly&apos; &quot;. [ Versions ] Goldman continued to revise the book of the musical right up to his death, which occurred shortly before the 1998 Paper Mill Playhouse production. Sondheim, too, has added and removed songs that he judged to be problematic in various productions. Ted Chapin explains: &quot; Today, Follies is rarely performed twice in exactly the same version. James Goldman&apos;s widow made the observation that the show has morphed throughout its entire life...The London production had new songs and dialogue. The Paper Mill Playhouse production used some elements from London but stayed close to the original. The 2001 Roundabout Broadway revival, the first major production following Goldman&apos;s death in 1998, was again a combination of previous versions. &quot; { Chapin, p. 312 } Major changes were made for the original production in London, which attempted to establish a lighter tone and favored a happier ending than the original Broadway production. According to Joanne Gordon, &quot; When &apos;Follies&apos; opened in London...it had an entirely different, and significantly more optimistic, tone. Goldman&apos;s revised book offered some small improvements over the original. &quot; { Gordon, Joanne. &quot; Chapter: Nixon&apos;s America and &apos;Follies&apos; &quot;. Stephen Sondheim: A Casebook, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, ISBN 0-8153-3586-5, p. 81 } According to Sondheim, the producer Cameron Mackintosh asked for changes for the 1987 London production. &quot; I was reluctantly happy to comply, my only serious balk being at his request that I cut &quot; The Road You Didn&apos;t Take &quot;... I saw no reason not to try new things, knowing we could always revert to the original (which we eventually did). The net result was four new songs...For reasons which I&apos;ve forgotten, I rewrote &quot; Loveland &quot; for the London production. There were only four showgirls in this version, and each one carried a shepard&apos;s crook with a letter of the alphabet on it. &quot; { Sondheim, pp. 243, 245 } The musical was written in one act, and the original director, Prince, did not want an intermission, while the co-director, Bennett, wanted two acts.

It was directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett, with choreography by Bennett, scenic design by Boris Aronson, costumes by Florence Klotz, and lighting by Tharon Musser. It starred Alexis Smith (Phyllis), John McMartin (Benjamin), Dorothy Collins (Sally), Gene Nelson (Buddy), along with several veterans of the Broadway and vaudeville stage. The supporting role of Carlotta was created by Yvonne De Carlo, and usually is given to a well-known veteran performer who can belt out a song. Other notable performers in the original productions were: Fifi D&apos;Orsay as Solange LaFitte, Justine Johnston as Heidi Schiller, Mary McCarty as Stella Deems, Arnold Moss as Dimitri Weismann, Ethel Shutta as Hattie Walker, and Marcie Stringer and Charles Welch as Emily and Theodore Whitman. The show closed on July 1, 1972 after 522 performances and 12 previews. According to Variety Magazine, the production was a &quot; total financial failure, with a cumulative loss of $792,000. &quot; { Chapin, p. 310 } Prince planned to present the musical on the West Coast and then on a national tour. However, the show did not do well in its Los Angeles engagement and plans for a tour ended. { Chapin, pp. 309-310 } Frank Rich, for many years the chief drama critic for The New York Times, had first garnered attention, while an undergraduate at Harvard University, with a lengthy essay for the Harvard Crimson about the show, which he had seen during its pre-Broadway run in Boston. He predicted that the show eventually would achieve recognition as a Broadway classic. { Chapin, pp. 116, 193-95 } Rich later wrote that audiences at the original production were baffled and restless. { Rich, Frank. &quot; Stage View; Sondheim&apos;s &apos;Follies&apos; Evokes Old Broadway &quot;. The New York Times, September 15, 1985 } For commercial reasons, the cast album was cut from two LP s to one early in production. Most songs were therefore heavily abridged and several were left entirely unrecorded. According to Craig Zadan, &quot; It&apos;s generally felt that... Prince made a mistake by giving the recording rights of Follies to Capitol Records, which in order to squeeze the unusually long score onto one disc, mutilated the songs by condensing some and omitting others. &quot; { Zadan, p. 175 } Chapin confirms this: &quot; Alas... final word came from Capitol that they would not go for two records.... [Dick Jones] now had to propose cuts throughout the score in consultation with Steve. &quot; { Chapin, p. 279 } &quot; One More Kiss &quot; was omitted from the final release but was restored for CD release. Chapin relates that &quot; there was one song that Dick Jones [producer of the cast album] didn&apos;t want to include on the album but which Steve Sondheim most definitely did. The song was &quot; One More Kiss &quot;, and the compromise was that if there was time, it would be recorded, even if Jones couldn&apos;t promise it would end up on the album. (It did get recorded but didn&apos;t make its way onto the album until the CD reissue years later.) &quot; { Chapin, p. 305 } { &quot; &apos;Follies&apos; 1971 Original Broadway Cast Recording &quot;. sondheimguide.com, retrieved December 14, 2010 } [ 1972 Los Angeles ] The musical was produced at The Muny, St. Louis, Missouri in July 1972 and then transferred to the Shubert Theatre, Century City, California, running from July 22, 1972 through October 1, 1972.

The concert starred Barbara Cook (Sally), George Hearn (Ben), Mandy Patinkin (Buddy), and Lee Remick (Phyllis), and featured Carol Burnett (Carlotta), Betty Comden (Emily), Adolph Green (Theodore), Liliane Montevecchi (Solange LaFitte), Elaine Stritch (Hattie Walker), Phyllis Newman (Stella Deems), Jim Walton (Young Buddy), Howard McGillin (Young Ben), Liz Callaway (Young Sally), Daisy Prince (Young Phyllis), Andre Gregory (Dmitri), Arthur Rubin (Roscoe), and Licia Albanese (Heidi Schiller). Rich, in his review, noted that &quot; As performed at Avery Fisher Hall, the score emerged as an original whole, in which the &apos;modern&apos; music and mock vintage tunes constantly comment on each other, much as the script&apos;s action unfolds simultaneously in 1971 (the year of the reunion) and 1941 (the year the Follies disbanded). &quot; Among the reasons the concert was staged was to provide an opportunity to record the entire score. The resulting album was more complete than the original cast album. However, director Herbert Ross took some liberties in adapting the book and score for the concert format—dance music was changed, songs were given false endings, new dialogue was spoken, reprises were added, and Patinkin was allowed to sing &quot; The God-Why-Don&apos;t-You-Love-Me Blues &quot; as a solo instead of a trio with two chorus girls. Portions of the concert were seen by audiences worldwide in the televised documentary about the making of the concert, also released on videotape and DVD, of &apos;Follies&apos; in Concert. { &quot; &apos;Follies in Concert&apos; (1986) (TV) &quot; Internet Movie Database listing, Retrieved August 29, 2010. } [ 1987 West End ] The London production purple poster The musical played in the West End at the Shaftesbury Theatre on July 21, 1987 and closed on February 4, 1989 after 644 performances.

Other cast replacements included Millicent Martin as Phyllis. Julia McKenzie returned to the production for the final four performances. The book &quot; was extensively reworked by James Goldman, with Sondheim&apos;s cooperation and also given an intermission. &quot; The producer Cameron Mackintosh did not like &quot; that there was no change in the characters from beginning to end.... In the London production... the characters come to understand each other. &quot; Sondheim &quot; did not think the London script was as good as the original. &quot; However, he thought that it was &quot; wonderful &quot; that, at the end of the first act, &quot; the principal characters recognized their younger selves and were able to acknowledge them throughout the last thirty minutes of the piece. &quot; { Secrest, p. 216 } Sondheim wrote four new songs: &quot; Country House &quot; (replacing &quot; The Road You Didn&apos;t Take &quot; ), &quot; Loveland &quot; (replacing the song of the same title), &quot; Ah, But Underneath &quot; (replacing &quot; The Story of Lucy and Jessie &quot;, for the non-dancer Diana Rigg ), and &quot; Make the Most of Your Music &quot; (replacing &quot; Live, Laugh, Love &quot; ).

July 23, 1987, International News section } The New York Times critic wrote: &quot; The initial critics&apos; reviews ranged from unqualified raves to some doubts whether the reworked book of James Goldman is up to the inventiveness of Sondheim&apos;s songs. &apos;A truly fantastic evening,&apos; The Financial Times concluded, while The London Daily News said, &apos;The musical is inspired,&apos; and The Times described the evening as &apos;a wonderful idea for a show which has failed to grow into a story.&apos; &quot; He further commented: &quot; In part, the show is a tribute to musical stage history, in which the 57-year-old Mr. Sondheim is steeped, for he first learned song writing at the knee of Oscar Hammerstein II and became the acknowledged master songwriter who bridged past musical stage romance into the modern musical era of irony and neurosis. Follies is a blend of both, and the new production is rounded out with production numbers celebrating love&apos;s simple hope for young lovers, its extravagant fantasies for Ziegfeld aficionados, and its fresh lesson for the graying principals. &quot; { Clines, Francis X. &quot; Follies&apos; Restaged In London &quot;, The New York Times.

The show and the score have a double vision: simultaneously squinting at the messes people make of their lives and wide-eyed at the lingering grace and lift of the music they want to hear. Sondheim&apos;s songs aren&apos;t parodies or deconstructions; they are evocations that recognize the power of a love song.
