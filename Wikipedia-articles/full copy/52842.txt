[ Valve: Handbook for New Employees 19 2012 March http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf ] { www.valvesoftware.com } Valve Corporation (also known as Valve Software or simply as Valve, and stylized as VALV E ) is an American video game development and digital distribution company based in Bellevue, Washington, United States. Founded in 1996 by former Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington, Valve became famous from its critically acclaimed &apos;&apos;Half-Life&apos;&apos; series, (the first game released in November 1998). It is also well known for its social-distribution network Steam; and for developing the Source engine, which has been used in every Valve game since its introduction in 2004. [ History ] Valve was founded by long-time Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington on August 24, 1996 [ http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/1171/ Steam Message Steam Valve Corporation 2007-08-24 2008-11-08 it was exactly eleven years ago that Valve was born ] [ http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2005/d2005-0038.html William R.

After incorporation in April 2003, [ http://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/search_detail.aspx?ubi%3D602290773 Washington Secretary of State 2010-04-25 ] it moved from its original location to Bellevue, Washington, the same city in which their original publisher, Sierra On-Line, Inc., was based. After the success of Half-Life, the team worked on mods, spin-off s, and sequel s, including Half-Life 2. All current Valve games are built on its Source engine, which owes much of its success to mods and sequels. The company has developed six game series: Half-Life, Team Fortress, Portal, Counter-Strike, Left 4 Dead and Day of Defeat. Valve is noted for its support of its games&apos; modding community: most prominently, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, and Day of Defeat. Valve has branched out with this tradition to continue developing the Warcraft III -based mod Defense of the Ancients with Dota 2. { Defense of the Ancients 2 announced } Each of these games began as a third-party mod that Valve purchased and developed into a full game. They also distribute community mods on Steam. Since Valve Corporation&apos;s debut, it has expanded both in scope and commercial value. On January 10, 2008, Valve Corporation announced the acquisition of Turtle Rock Studios.

Originally planned for release in late 1997, Half-Life launched on November 19, 1998. Valve acquired TF Software PTY Ltd, the makers of the Team Fortress mod for Quake, in May 1998 with the intent to create a standalone Team Fortress game. The Team Fortress Classic mod, essentially a port of the original Team Fortress mod for Quake, was released for Half-Life in 1999.Gearbox contributed much after the release of Half-Life. Gearbox Software is responsible for the Half-Life expansion packs, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift, along with the home console versions of Half-Life for the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation 2 which included a third expansion pack called Half-Life: Decay, that enabled two-player split-screen co-op. [ Steam ] [ Steam (software) ] Gabe Newell (foreground) and Doug Lombardi (background), 2007 Valve announced its games platform Steam in 2002. At the time it looked merely to be a method of streamlining the patch process common in online video game s, but was later revealed as a replacement for much of the framework of the World Opponent Network service and also as a distribution/ digital rights management system for entire games. Valve has shown support for some of their games. For example, Valve has offered considerable updates for Team Fortress 2; including adding new maps, new game modes, additional weapons, new achievements, and additional game play mechanics, as well adding a store which sells in-game items. All such updates, with the exception of the aforementioned in-game items, are mandatory, and provided free of charge. There are over 1,400 games available on Steam, and in October 2010 Valve announced that it had surpassed 30 million active user accounts. [ http://store.steampowered.com/news/4502/ Steam Surpasses 30 Million Account Mark 2010-10-18 Valve Corporation 3 November 2010 ] [ Lawsuits ] [ Valve vs. Vivendi case ] Between 2002 and 2005, Valve was involved in a complex legal showdown with its publisher, Vivendi Universal (under Vivendi&apos;s brand Sierra Entertainment ). It officially began on August 14, 2002, when Valve sued Sierra for copyright infringement, alleging that the publisher illegally distributed copies of their games to Internet cafe s. They later added claims of breach of contract, accusing their publisher of withholding royalties and delaying the release of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero until after the holiday season. Vivendi fought back, saying that Gabe Newell and marketing director Doug Lombardi had misrepresented Valve&apos;s position in meetings with the publisher. Vivendi later countersued, claiming that Valve&apos;s Steam content distribution system attempted to circumvent their publishing agreement. Vivendi sought intellectual property rights to Half-Life and a ruling preventing Valve from using Steam to distribute Half-Life 2. On November 29, 2004, Judge Thomas S. Zilly of U.S. Federal District Court in Seattle, Washington ruled in favor of Valve Corporation. Specifically, the ruling stated that Vivendi Universal and its affiliates (including Sierra) were not authorized to distribute Valve games, either directly or indirectly, through cyber cafés to end users for pay-to-play activities pursuant to the parties&apos; current publishing agreement. In addition, Judge Zilly ruled that Valve could recover copyright damages for infringements without regard to the publishing agreement&apos;s limitation of liability clause.

[ Valve and Vivendi Universal Games Settle Lawsuit Valve Corporation 2005-04-29 2008-11-08 ] Electronic Arts announced on July 18, 2005 they would be teaming up with Valve in a multi-year deal to distribute their games, replacing Vivendi Universal from then onwards.

[ Valve Corporation vs. Activision Blizzard, Inc. ] In April 2009, Valve sued Activision Blizzard, which acquired Sierra Entertainment after a merger with its parent company, Vivendi Universal Games. Activision had allegedly refused to honor the Valve vs Vivendi arbitration agreement. Activision had only paid Valve $1,967,796 of the $2,391,932 award, refusing to pay the remaining $424,136 claiming it had overpaid that sum in the past years.

According to Valve&apos;s suit, Activision said that it wouldn&apos;t pay the rest and if Valve went to court Activision would countersue. Valve has apparently called Activision&apos;s bluff and the parties are now once again at odds. 2009-05-01 ] [ Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. vs. Valve Corporation ] Shortly after Valve filed its trademark for &quot; Dota &quot; to secure the franchising rights for Dota 2, DotA-Allstars, LLC, run by former contributors to the games&apos;s predecessor, Defense of the Ancients, filed an opposing trademark in August 2010.

After the opposition was overruled in Valve&apos;s favor, Blizzard itself filed an opposition against Valve in November 2011, citing their license agreement with developers, as well as their ownership of DotA-Allstars, LLC. [ Plunkett Luke http://kotaku.com/5883938/blizzard-is-suing-valve Blizzard and Valve go to War Over DOTA Name 2012-02-10 Kotaku ] On May 11, 2012, Blizzard and Valve announced that the dispute had been settled, with Valve retaining the rights to the term &quot; Dota &quot;, while Blizzard would change the name of their map, Blizzard DOTA, to &quot; Blizzard All-stars &quot;.

Valve itself has fully acknowledged the term, including tracking known discrepancies between ideal and actual releases on their public development wiki [ http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time Valve Time Valve Corporation 2010-06-09 ] and using it in announcements about such delays.
