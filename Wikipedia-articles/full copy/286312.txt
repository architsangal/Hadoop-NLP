Retrieved on August 10, 2010. &quot; Corporate Headquarters 333 Pfingsten Road Northbrook, IL 60062-2096. &quot; } UL develops standards and test procedures for products, materials, components, assemblies, tools and equipment, chiefly dealing with product safety. UL also evaluates and certifies the efficiency of a company’s business processes through its management system registration programs. Additionally, UL analyzes drinking and other clean water samples through its drinking water laboratory in South Bend, Indiana and evaluates products for environmental sustainability through its subsidiary, UL Environment. UL is one of several companies approved for such testing by the U.S. federal agency Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA maintains a list of approved testing laboratories, known as Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories. [ History ] { Northbrook } Underwriters Laboratories Inc. was founded in 1894 by William Henry Merrill. Early in his career as an electrical engineer in Boston, a 25 year old Merrill was sent to investigate the World Fair ’s Palace of Electricity. Upon seeing a growing potential in his field, Merrill stayed in Chicago to found Underwriters Laboratories. Merrill soon went to work developing standards, launching tests, designing equipment and uncovering hazards. Aside from his work at UL, Merrill served as the National Fire Protection Association’s secretary-treasurer (1903–1909) and president (1910–1912) and was an active member of the Chicago Board and Union Committee. In 1916, Merrill became UL’s first president. UL published its first standard, “Tin Clad Fire Door s,” in 1903. The following year, the UL Mark made its debut with the labeling of a fire extinguisher. In 1905, UL established a Label Service for certain product categories that require more frequent inspections. UL inspectors conducted the first factory inspections on labeled products at manufacturers’ facilities—a practice that remains a hallmark of UL’s testing and certification program. UL has expanded into an organization with 64 laboratory, testing and certification facilities serving customers in 98 countries. It has also evolved from its roots in electrical and fire safety to address broader safety issues, such as hazardous substances, water quality, food safety, performance testing and environmental sustainability. [ For-profit subsidiary ] On August 28, 2007, the nonprofit and tax-exempt UL announced that its Board of Trustees had resolved to develop a for-profit testing and certification subsidiary. { News Release, } [ November 2011 ] { Underwriters Laboratories, 28 August 2007. } The parent nonprofit company will continue to develop safety standards —with the for-profit subsidiary intended to generate money to be used for this work. The for-profit part of the business promotes the sales of standards developed by the nonprofit part. This transition was lead by CFO Michael Saltzman. This was the first transition of this magnitude to take place. { Log of Meeting for Underwriters Laboratories (UL) to describe their for-profit subsidiary, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, 10 April 2008. } [ UL Standards &lt; ref &gt; &lt; link type= &quot; external &quot; href= &quot; http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/catalog/stdscatframe.html &quot; &gt; UL Standards and Outlines of Investigation &lt; /link &gt;, Underwriters Laboratories &lt; /ref &gt; ] { Melville, } { New York location } Electrical Enclosures Boxes-Junction and Pull (BGUZ) Cabinets and Cutout Boxes-Sheet Metal (CYIV) Industrial Control Panel Enclosures (NITW) Industrial Control Panels Industrial Control Panels (NITW) Flame Control Panels Power Press Control Panels Industrial Control Equipment Auxiliary Devices (NKCR) Electromechanical Solid State Mechanical Electronic Combination Motor Controllers (NKJH) Float and Pressure-Operated Switches (NKPZ) Magnetic Motor Controllers (NLDX) Manual Motor Controllers (NLRV) Motor Controllers-Miscellaneous (NMFT) Miscellaneous Apparatus (NMTR) Switches, Industrial Control (NRNT) Programmable Controllers (NRAQ) Proximity Switches (NRKH) High-Voltage Industrial Control Equipment Motor Controllers, Over 1500 V (NJHU) Motor Controller Accessories, Over 1500 V (NJIJ) Medium Voltage Power Conversion Equipment (NJIC) Power Conversion Equipment Power Conversion Equipment (NMMS) Locks for Safes Mechanical Dial Combination Locks (Group I and Group II) Electronic Locks Biometric Locks [ Similar organizations ] Baseefa — a similar organization in the UK Canadian Standards Association (CSA) — a similar organization in Canada; also serves as a competitive alternative for USA products ETL SEMKO — a competing testing laboratory, part of Intertek; based in London, UK IAPMO R &amp; T — a competing certification body, based in Ontario, California, USA MET Laboratories, Inc. — a competing testing laboratory based in Baltimore, Maryland, USA NTA Inc — a competing certification agency based in Nappanee, Indiana, USA Sira — a similar organization for the UK/Europe T &amp; Uuml;V — a similar German approvals organisation [ See also ] ANSI Consumer Reports Consumers Union Fire test Good Housekeeping Seal National Sanitation Foundation NEMKO Product certification Quality control RoHS Safety engineering UL94, a flammability standard UL 1703, Photovoltaic Flat-Plate Modules UL 1741, Inverters, Converters, Controllers and Interconnection System Equipment for Use With Distributed Energy Resources UL 2703, Rack Mounting Systems and Clamping Devices for Flat-Plate Photovoltaic Modules and Panels [ References ] [ External links ] [ Underwriters&apos; Laboratories of Canada ] List of US NRTLs at OSHA Category:Commercial laboratories Category:Companies based in Northbrook, Illinois Category:Organizations based in Chicago, Illinois Category:Organizations established in 1894 Category:Safety organizations Category:Standards organizations de:Underwriters Laboratories ko:UL 인증기관 it:Underwriters Laboratories ja:アメリカ保険業者安全試験所 pt:Underwriters Laboratories tr:UL Onayı zh:UL
