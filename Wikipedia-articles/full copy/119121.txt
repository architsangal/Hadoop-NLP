[ Geography ] [ 2.5 sqmi km2 ] [ 2.2 sqmi km2 ] [ 0.3 sqmi km2 ] Marine City can also be considered as in the Blue Water Area, a subregion of the Thumb. { It is part of the } { Detroit-Warren-Livonia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the } { Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint Combined Statistical Area (CSA). } [ History ] The area of Marine City had been Ojibwa territory for centuries before the first European contact. French trappers and missionaries settled in Detroit and nearby areas during the colonial period. The first Catholic Church was built by French Catholics at Catholic Point, where they had bought land before the United States was formed. It was not until after the American Revolution that European-American settlers arrived in any number. In the 1780s they obtained a deed for land from the Chippewa Indians. The Americans called the community &quot; Yankee Point &quot;, because so many settlers came from the Northern Tier of states, with late 18th and 19th century migration originating from New England. They also called the settlement &quot; Belle River &quot;, later the name of a neighborhood. The village was plat ted as Newport in 1835-37. Although never incorporated by that name, it was known as &quot; Newport &quot; for 31 years. In 1865, it was incorporated as the Village of Marine City. Thriving on lumber and other commodity trade, the village re-incorporated as a city in June 1887. { Romig, Walter (1986).

ISBN 0-8143-1838-X. } The second half of the 19th century was the period of great growth in the village, with many workers employed in the lumber and shipping industries. Rafts of lumber filled the St. Clair River in the spring to be worked at Marine City or Detroit. Shipyards built some of the many ships that crossed the Great Lakes. Lake steamers linked passengers with small towns around the lakes. Their decks were full and their flags were flying. Marine City was centered on a park by the river, where bands played in the gazebo during the summer. As the lumber business ran down, the area became linked to other resource extraction. Ships carried iron from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota to Ashtabula, Ohio for steel. Marine City was where the captains of lake ships lived. Many worked for Pittsburgh Steamship Company, piloting iron ore ships from Duluth, Minnesota to Ashtabula and other ports. Marine City is also the home of 10 Antique Stores including the World Famous &quot; Water Street Antique Mall &quot; located at 412 S Water Street.
