Mary Kay Henry, International President ] Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is a labor union representing about 1.8 million workers in over 100 occupations in the United States (including Puerto Rico ), and Canada. SEIU is focused on organizing workers in three sectors: health care (over half of members work in the health care field), including hospital, home care and nursing home worker s; public services (local and state government employees); and property services (including janitors, security officer s and food service workers).

It is affiliated with the Change to Win Federation and the Canadian Labour Congress. SEIU is based out of Washington, D.C., and has several internal divisions which include: Communications, Government Affairs, New Media, Organizing, Political, Global Strength, Pension/Benefits, Community Strength, Research, and Legal. The union states that its top priorities are to stand up for working families to help bring economic relief to millions across the country, fix the nation&apos;s broken health care system, and fight to guarantee workers&apos; rights on the job. SEIU is sometimes referred to as the &quot; purple ocean &quot; at political events because of the union&apos;s recognizable purple shirts. The union is also known for its Justice for Janitors program and strong support for Democratic candidates. It spent $28 million supporting Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, making it the &quot; organization that spent the most to help Barack Obama get elected president. &quot; { Carney, Timothy (2011-02-23) Obama&apos;s top funder also leads the nation in White House visits, } { Washington Examiner } [ History ] The SEIU was founded in 1921 in Chicago as the Building Services Employees Union (BSEU); its first members were janitor s, elevator operator s, and window washers. Membership increased significantly with a 1934 strike in New York City &apos;s Garment District. Growth from organizing new members, and affiliating with other unions, it includes more than 225,000 janitors in at least 29 cities in the United States and at least four cities in Canada, and merger s with other unions resulted in a membership working in industries well beyond BSEIU&apos;s initial boundaries. In 1968 it renamed itself Service Employees International Union. In 1980 it absorbed the International Jewelry Workers Union, later the Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union ( Local 1199 ), and the Health &amp; Human Services Workers. [ August 2009 ] [ August 2009 Are Drug &amp; Hosp a separate union from H &amp; HS workers? ] In 1995, SEIU President John Sweeney was elected president of the AFL-CIO, the confederation of labor unions in the United States and Canada. After Sweeney&apos;s departure, former social worker Andrew Stern was elected president of SEIU. In the first ten years of Stern&apos;s administration, the union&apos;s membership grew rapidly, making SEIU the largest union in the AFL-CIO by 2000. [ February 2007 ] In 2003, SEIU was a founding member of the New Unity Partnership, an organization of unions that pushed for reforms [ August 2009 ] at the national level, and a greater commitment to organizing unorganized workers into unions. In 2005, SEIU was a founding member of the Change to Win Coalition, which furthered the reformist agenda, criticizing the AFL-CIO for focusing its attention on electoral politics, instead of taking sufficient action to encourage organizing in the face of decreasing union membership. In June 2004, SEIU launched a non-union-member affiliate group called Purple Ocean to stand with workers in the fight for economic justice. On the eve of the 2005 AFL-CIO convention, SEIU, along with its Change to Win partners, the Teamsters union, and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, announced that it was disaffiliating from the AFL-CIO after the 50-year-old labor federation declined to pass the Coalition&apos;s suggested reforms.

And in July 2009, 13,000 home care attendants in the state&apos;s consumer directed home care program voted to join the Missouri Home Care Union, a statewide union of home care attendants. In 2009, the union launched a nationwide campaign against Sodexo to improve wage and job standards. Clean Up Sodexo serves as the online voice of the workers at Sodexo, many of whom make near poverty-level wages working as food service workers at universities around the country. Since 2004, the union has seen success organizing workers in Texas, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona in particular. Over 5,000 janitors organized with SEIU in Houston, Texas in 2005, which was especially significant due to the size of the campaign and its location in an area with low union density. { Steven Greenhouse, &quot; Janitors&apos; Union, Recently Organized, Strikes in Houston, &quot; } { New York Times, November 3, 2006. } In Florida, a high-profile strike at the University of Miami which lasted nine weeks and included a hunger strike, ended with the union winning representation of 425 janitors on campus. { Steven Greenhouse, &quot; Walkout Ends at University of Miami as Janitors&apos; Pact Is Reached, &quot; New York Times, May 2, 2006. } This victory was shortly followed by another 600 workers at North Shore Medical Center, also in Miami, voting to join the SEIU in early 2006.

Commercial providers are licensed to operate foster homes with up to five senior or disabled residents. By forming a union, providers would for the first time be able to collectively bargain a contract with the state over service fees, benefits, regulations, and respect. In the spring of 2007 the state Employment Relations Board (ERB) verified that a significant majority of the commercial providers across Oregon had signed authorization cards supporting forming a union, and Governor Ted Kulongoski signed an executive order recognizing commercial adult foster care providers as a union, and opening the path to contract bargaining.
