This agreement allowed cooperation between the two companies and the opening of Walmart stores and Sam&apos;s Clubs in Mexico.

[ Controversies ] An April 2012 article in The New York Times reported that a former executive of Wal-Mart de Mexico alleged in September 2005 that Wal-Mart de Mexico had paid bribes via local fixers called gestores to officials throughout Mexico in order to obtain construction permits, information, and other favors, that Wal-Mart investigators found credible evidence that Mexican and American laws had been broken, and that Wal-Mart executives in the United States &quot; hushed up &quot; the allegations. Reportedly, envelopes of cash produced dramatic results in a wide variety of situations and with both high and low level Mexican officials and functionaries.

April 22, 2012 ] Many of the allegations in the NYT article were several years old. After the article was released, Walmart released a statement denying allegations and describing its anti-corruption policy. While an official Walmart report states that they found no evidence of corruption, the article alleges that previous internal reports had indeed turned up such evidence before the story became public.
