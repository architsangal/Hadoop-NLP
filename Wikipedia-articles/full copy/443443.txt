Just over [ 100 mi km 2 ] north of London, it is east of Nottingham and south of Lincoln. North Kesteven is one of seven districts in Lincolnshire, England and is in the centre of the County. Its council, North Kesteven District Council, is based in Sleaford in the former offices of Kesteven County Council. [ History ] It was originally planned to have the council offices in Bracebridge Hall on Newark Road in Lincoln, then the base of North Kesteven Rural District. In November 1973, a decision was taken to base it in The Hoplands in Sleaford, the base of East Kesteven Rural District. In January 1974 it was realised that this building was far too small for the size needed, and the 81 rooms of Kesteven County Council&apos;s headquarters on East Road in Sleaford would suit the new council instead. The Hoplands has now been demolished for housing. The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It was a merger of the previous urban district of Sleaford, along with East Kesteven Rural District and North Kesteven Rural District, all from the administrative county of Kesteven. [ Geography ] North Kesteven borders West Lindsey (along the Foss Dyke and the River Witham ) and the city of Lincoln to the north, East Lindsey to the north-east (along the River Witham), Boston (borough) to the east, South Holland to the south-east, South Kesteven to the south, and the county of Nottinghamshire to the west. RAF Waddington is a main employer in the district North Kesteven covers an area of [ 356 sqmi km2 2 ], of which 94% is classified as green space, which includes agricultural land and open space.

More than 80% of the population live in rural settlements or a market town.

As a result, local communities have historically been self-reliant, with parish and town councils providing services, such as playing fields or play areas, which are frequently provided by district councils elsewhere. The district has two main RAF bases - RAF Cranwell, and RAF Waddington, both situated close to the A15, the main road through the district. There is also RAF Digby between Sleaford and Metheringham. RAF Swinderby closed in 1995. [ Demographics ] The predominately rural nature of the district has encouraged people to move to tha area to take advantage of its quality of life, low crime rates, relatively low house prices, good-quality education and local heritage. This is reflected in research, which has shown 90% of residents are satisfied with their local area as a place to live and 82% of residents feel their area is a place where people from different backgrounds can get on well together. [ Ipsos Mori Place Survey 2008 North Kesteven: Provisional Weighted National Indicator Results 2009 ] North Kesteven&apos;s residents live in around 100 mainly small communities. Major concentrations are in Sleaford, with a population of over 17,000; North Hykeham, with around 13,500 residents; and 10 larger villages with populations of over 2,500. [ NKDC NK Facts and Figures: Parish Estimates based on Council Tax Households 2008 ] Within the district, 40% of the population live in the &quot; Lincoln Fringe &quot;, the area immediately surrounding Lincoln City. [ Office for National Statistics The Census 2001 2001 http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/ 2009-01-04 ] 72 parishes serve the district communities, comprising 58 parish councils, two town councils and 12 parish meetings. The population of the district is 104,800 [ Office for National Statistics Mid-Year Population Estimates 2008 http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk%3D15106 2009-01-04 ] equating to just over one person per hectare. The population grew by 11.5% between 2001 and 2007, making the district one of the top six fastest-growing districts in England and Wales. [ RSN Rural population rise outstrips cities 2008 http://www.rsnonline.org.uk/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Btask%3Dview%26amp%3Bid%3D570%26amp%3BItemid%3D110 2009-01-04 ] This rate of growth is a result of high house-building rates and consequent in-migration to the district from elsewhere in England, as opposed to natural population change. The growth in population is projected to continue [ Office for National Statistics Sub-National Population Projections for England 2006 http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/product.asp?vlnk%3D997 2009-01-04 ] with an extra 14,000 homes expected from 2001 to 2026. [ East Midlands Regional Assembly Draft Regional Plan 2006 ] At the 2001 census, there were 94,024 citizens in the district. Of all districts in Lincolnshire, it contains the highest proportion of married people and the least number of divorced people. According to the Indices of deprivation 2007, it is the least socially deprived area in Lincolnshire, with South Kesteven, the next. [ Education ] The district has comprehensive schools in North Hykeham, Branston and Welbourn. The area around Sleaford (including Ruskington ) has selective schools. In 2007, the district had the third best results in the county at GCSE [ October 2008 ]. Other schools in the area include Kesteven and Sleaford High School and Branston Community College.
