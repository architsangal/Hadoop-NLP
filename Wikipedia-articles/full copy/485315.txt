The declension of Irish noun s, the definite article, and the adjective s is discussed on this page. (For pronoun s, see Irish morphology.) [ Nouns ] [ Gender ] Nouns in Irish are divided into two gender s, masculine and feminine. While gender should be learned when the noun is learned, there are some rules that can be followed: In general, words ending in a broad consonant are masculine, while words ending in a slender consonant are feminine. There are some exceptions, mostly dealing with specific endings and suffixes; for example, words ending in [ ga -óir/-eoir ] and [ ga -ín ] (with a slender [ /ɾʲ/ ] and [ /nʲ/ ] respectively) are masculine, while words ending in [ ga -óg/-eog ] (with a broad [ /ɡ/ ] ) are feminine. This leads to some unexpected gender assignments, such as [ ga cailín ] &quot; girl &quot; (masculine) and [ ga gasóg ] &quot; boy scout &quot; (feminine). [ Case ] Irish has four case s : common (usually called nominative, but it covers the role of an accusative as well), vocative, genitive, and dative. [ Nominative ] The nominative is used in the following functions: [ ga Tá an catag ól. ] &quot; The cat is drinking. &quot; { Sentence object } [ ga Bhris Seán an fhuinneog. ] &quot; Seán broke the window. &quot; { Predicate of the } { copula } [ ga Is amadáné. ] &quot; He is an idiot. &quot; { Object of the } { preposition s } [ ga gan ] { &quot; without &quot; and } [ ga go dtí ] { &quot; up to &quot; } [ ga gan an t-airgead ] [ ga go dtí an t-am ] &quot; without the money &quot; &quot; up to the time &quot; [ Vocative ] The vocative is used in direct address, and is always preceded by the particle [ ga a ], which triggers lenition. (In spoken Irish this particle is often omitted, especially before a vowel sound.) The first declension is the only declension in which the vocative is distinct from the nominative. [ ga Cá bhfuil tú, a mhic? ] [ ga A Sheáin, tar anseo! ] &quot; Where are you, son? &quot; &quot; Seán, come here! &quot; [ Genitive ] The genitive indicates possession and material of composition: [ ga hata an fhir ] [ ga clann na mná ] [ ga coinnleoirí an easpaig ] [ ga fáinne óir ] [ ga bróga leathair ] &quot; the man&apos;s hat &quot; &quot; the woman&apos;s children &quot; &quot; the bishop&apos;s candelabra &quot; &quot; a ring of gold, a golden ring &quot; &quot; shoes of leather, leather shoes &quot; The object of a verbal noun also requires the genitive: [ ga ag caitheamh airgid ] &quot; spending money &quot; The object of a compound preposition is in the genitive. Formally, these prepositions are actually prepositional phrases. [ ga ar chúl an dorais ] [ ga ar feadh míosa ] [ ga ar son na hÉireann ] &quot; behind the door &quot; (lit. &quot; on the back of the door &quot; ) &quot; one month long &quot; (lit. &quot; for the duration of one month &quot; ) &quot; for Ireland&apos;s sake &quot; [ Dative ] The dative is used with the object of most simple prepositions except [ ga gan ] and [ ga go dtí ]. In the standard language, the dative of a noun is identical to the nominative, but some dialects have distinct datives in the second and fifth declensions. Even in the standard language, [ ga Éire ] &quot; Ireland &quot; has a distinct dative: [ ga Éirinn ]. [ ga ag an athair ] [ ga as an teach ] [ ga ar an arán ] [ ga in oráiste ] [ ga go hifreann ] [ ga leis an airgead ] [ ga ó Éirinn ] &quot; at the father &quot; &quot; out of the house &quot; &quot; on the bread &quot; &quot; in an orange &quot; &quot; to hell &quot; &quot; with the money &quot; &quot; from Ireland &quot; [ Declension ] There are five recognized declensions in Irish. The makeup of the declensions depends on three factors: the gender of the noun the formation of the genitive singular relation of genitive singular to nominative plural The following chart describes the characteristics of each declension class: Nom. sing. ends with: Gen. sing. ends with: Gender First declension Broad consonant Slender consonant Masculine Second declension Broad or slender consonant -e/-í Feminine Third declension Slender or broad consonant -a Masculine or feminine Fourth declension Vowel or -ín (no change) Masculine or feminine Fifth declension Vowel or slender consonant Broad consonant Mostly feminine [ First ] The first declension is made up of masculine nouns. The nominative singular ends in a broad consonant, which is made slender in the genitive singular. The most common formation of the plural has the opposite pattern: the nominative ends in a slender consonant, the genitive in a broad consonant (these plurals are known as weak plurals in comparison with strong plurals which maintain the identical form for all cases in the plural). The dative is identical to the nominative in both numbers, although an obsolete dative plural in -aibh is still sometimes encountered in old-fashioned literary style. [ ga bád ] [ ga bád ] [ /bˠaːd̪ˠ/ ] [ ga báid ] [ /bˠaːdʲ/ ] [ ga a bháid ] [ /ə waːdʲ/ ] [ ga a bháda ] [ /ə waːd̪ˠə/ ] [ ga báid ] [ /bˠaːdʲ/ ] [ ga bád ] [ /bˠaːd̪ˠ/ ] [ ga bád ] [ /bˠaːd̪ˠ/ ] [ ga báid ] [ ga bádaibh ] &quot; boat &quot; Singular Plural Nominative Vocative Genitive Dative (obsolete ) When [ /x/ ] in the gen. sing. and nom. pl. of a polysyllabic word is made slender, it also becomes voice d, thus: [ /x/ ] [ /ç/ ] [ /j/ ] [ /əj/ ] [ /iː/ ] [ /ə/ ] [ /əɟ/ ] &gt; &gt;. The resulting is written -(a)igh and is pronounced,, or, depending on dialect. [ ga marcach ] [ ga marcach ] [ /mˠaɾˠkəx/ ] [ ga marcaigh ] [ /mˠaɾˠkiː/ ] [ /mˠaɾˠkə/ ] [ /mˠaɾˠkəɟ/ ] [ ga a mharcaigh ] [ /ə waɾˠkiː/ ] [ /ə waɾˠkə/ ] [ /ə waɾˠkəɟ/ ] [ ga a mharcacha ] [ /ə waɾˠkəxə/ ] [ ga marcaigh ] [ /mˠaɾˠkiː/ ] [ /mˠaɾˠkə/ ] [ /mˠaɾˠkəɟ/ ] [ ga marcach ] [ /mˠaɾˠkəx/ ] [ ga marcach ] [ /mˠaɾˠkəx/ ] [ ga marcaigh ] [ ga marcachaibh ] &quot; a horseman &quot; Singular Plural Nominative ~ ~ Vocative ~ ~ Genitive ~ ~ Dative (obsolete ) Some nouns undergo a vowel change before the slender consonant of the genitive singular/nominative plural: [ ga ball, baill ] [ /bˠaːɫ̪, bˠailʲ/ ] [ ga bonn, boinn ] [ /bˠuːn̪ˠ, bˠiːnʲ/ ] [ ga ceann, cinn ] [ /caːn̪ˠ, ciːnʲ/ ] [ ga fear, fir ] [ ga iasc, éisc ] [ ga mac, mic ] [ /mˠak, mʲɪc/ ] [ ga poll, poill ] [ /pˠoːɫ̪, pˠailʲ/ ] - an (internal) organ, component part - a sole, coin - a head - a man - a fish - a son (Note: The first consonant is made slender in the gen.sg./nom.pl. as well!) - a hole Many words of this declension form the plural with one of the endings -(a)í, -ta, -tha, -anna. These are known as &quot; strong plural &quot; endings, which means the plural is identical in all cases in the standard language. Some examples: [ ga aonach ] [ ga aonaigh ] [ ga aontaí ] [ ga bealach ] [ ga bealaigh ] [ ga bealaí ] [ ga carr ] [ /kaːɾˠ/ ] [ ga cairr ] [ /kaːɾˠ/ ] [ ga carranna ] [ /kaɾˠən̪ˠə/ ] [ ga glór ] [ ga glóir ] [ ga glórtha ] [ ga leanbh ] [ ga linbh ] [ ga leanaí ] [ ga néal ] [ ga néil ] [ ga néalta ] [ ga rós ] [ ga róis ] [ ga rósanna ] [ ga samhradh ] [ ga samhraidh ] [ ga samhraí ] [ ga scéal ] [ ga scéil ] [ ga scéalta ] [ ga toradh ] [ ga toraidh ] [ ga torthaí ], gen. sg., pl. - a fair, gen. sg., pl. - a way, gen. sg., pl. - a car, gen. sg., pl. - a voice, gen. sg., pl. - a child, gen. sg., pl. - a cloud, gen. sg., pl. - a rose, gen. sg., pl. - a summer, gen. sg., pl. - a story, gen. sg., pl. - fruit Some nouns have a weak plural (a plural where the genitive is different from the nominative, and is identical to the form of the nominative singular) in -a: [ ga ceart ] [ ga cirt ] [ ga cearta ] [ ga ceart ] [ ga cleas ] [ ga clis ] [ ga cleasa ] [ ga cleas ] [ ga úll ] [ ga úill ] [ ga úlla ] [ ga úll ], gen. sg., nom. pl., gen. pl. - a right, gen. sg., nom. pl., gen. pl. - a trick, gen. sg., nom. pl., gen. pl. - an apple Other strong plural formations are found in: [ ga bóthar, bóthair; bóithre ] [ ga breitheamh, breithimh; breithiúna ] [ ga briathar, briathair; briathra ] [ ga cloigeann, cloiginn; cloigne ] [ ga doras, dorais; doirse ] [ ga ollamh, ollaimh; ollúna ] [ ga solas, solais; soilse ] - road - judge - verb - skull - door - professor - light [ Second ] The second declension is made up of mostly feminine nouns, and features a nominative singular form that can end in either a broad or a slender consonant. The genitive singular ends in a slender consonant followed by -e. The most common plural form has a broad consonant followed by -a in the nominative, and a broad consonant alone in the genitive. The vocative is the same as the nominative, as is the dative in the standard language. [ ga bróg ] [ ga bróg ] [ /bˠɾˠoːɡ/ ] [ ga bróga ] [ /ˈbˠɾˠoːɡə/ ] [ ga bróige ] [ /ˈbˠɾˠoːɟə/ ] [ ga bróg ] [ /bˠɾˠoːɡ/ ] [ ga bróg ] [ /bˠɾˠoːɡ/ ] [ ga bróig ] [ ga bróga ] [ /ˈbˠɾˠoːɡə/ ] [ ga brógaibh ] &quot; shoe &quot; Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative Genitive Dative &amp; emsp;(obsolete/dialectal ) &amp; emsp;(obsolete ) [ ga deoir ] [ ga deoir ] [ /dʲoːɾʲ/ ] [ ga deora ] [ /ˈdʲoːɾˠə/ ] [ ga deoire ] [ /ˈdʲoːɾʲə/ ] [ ga deor ] [ /dʲoːɾˠ/ ] &quot; tear &quot; Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Dative Genitive In Connacht Irish and Waterford Irish it is often the case that all nouns of the second declension in the nom. sg. end with a slender consonant (e.g. [ ga bróig ] &quot; a shoe &quot; ). In some Munster varieties as well as the old literary language, the dative singular is distinct and ends in a slender consonant alone (in effect the dative sg. is formed by dropping the -e from the genitive sg.), e.g. [ ga i mo bhróig ] &quot; in my shoe &quot;. (Historically, nominative forms like [ ga bróig ] are descended from the old dative.) When [ /x/ ] in the gen. sing. is made slender, it is also voiced, so [ /x/ ] &gt; [ /ç/ ] &gt; [ /j/ ]. [ /əjə/ ] becomes [ /iː/ ], and is written -(a)í. [ ga girseach ] [ ga girseach ] [ /ˈɟɪɾˠʃəx/ ] [ ga girseacha ] [ /ˈɟɪɾˠʃəxə/ ] [ ga girsí ] [ /ˈɟɪɾˠʃiː/ ] [ ga girseach ] [ /ˈɟɪɾˠʃəx/ ] [ ga girseach ] [ /ˈɟɪɾˠʃəx/ ] [ ga girsigh ] [ ga girseacha ] [ /ˈɟɪɾˠʃəxə/ ] [ ga girseachaibh ] &quot; little girl &quot; Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Std. dative Genitive Dative &amp; emsp;(obsolete/dialectal ) &amp; emsp;(obsolete ) Polysyllabic words that end with a slender consonant take a weak plural in -í: [ ga eaglais ] [ ga eaglais ] [ /ˈaɡɫ̪əʃ/ ] [ ga eaglaisí ] [ /ˈaɡɫ̪əʃiː/ ] [ ga eaglaise ] [ /ˈaɡɫ̪əʃə/ ] [ ga eaglaisí ] [ /ˈaɡɫ̪əʃiː/ ] &quot; church &quot; Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Dative Genitive Many words in this declension form a strong plural with one of the endings -t(h)a,-te, -(e)acha or -eanna: [ ga áit, áite, áiteanna ] [ ga coill, coille, coillte ] [ /kailʲ, ˈkelʲə, ˈkailʲtʲə/ ] [ ga iníon, iníne, iníonacha ] [ ga obair, oibre, oibreacha ] [ ga spéir, spéire, spéartha ] [ ga tír, tíre, tíortha ] [ ga tonn, toinne, tonnta ] [ /t̪ˠuːn̪ˠ, t̪ˠɪnʲə, t̪ˠuːn̪ˠt̪ˠə/ ] [ ga ubh, uibhe, uibheacha ] &quot; place &quot; &quot; forest &quot; &quot; daughter &quot; &quot; work &quot; &quot; sky &quot; &quot; country &quot; &quot; wave &quot; &quot; egg &quot; Other strong plural formations are found in: [ ga fiacail, fiacaile; fiacla ] [ ga gualainn, gualainne; guaillí ] [ ga scian, scine; sceana ] [ ga sliabh, sléibhe; sléibhte ] - tooth - shoulder - knife (NB irregular genitive singular) (m.) - mountain (note irregular genitive singular and masculine gender) [ Third ] The third declension is made up of masculine and feminine nouns. It is characterized by the genitive singular in -a. The majority of nouns in this class form the plural in -(a)í. The final consonant of the stem may be broad or slender: it retains its quality in the plural, but is always broad in the genitive singular. Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Dative broad or slender cons. -(a)í Genitive broad cons. + -a -(a)í [ ga bádóir ] [ ga bádóir ] [ /ˈbˠaːd̪ˠoːɾʲ/ ] [ ga badóiridhe ] [ /ˈbˠaːd̪ˠoːɾʲiː/ ] [ ga bádóra ] [ /ˈbˠaːd̪ˠoːɾˠə/ ] [ ga badóirí ] [ /ˈbˠaːd̪ˠoːɾʲiː/ ] (m.) &quot; boatsman &quot; Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Dative Genitive [ ga rás ] [ ga rás ] [ /ɾˠaːsˠ/ ] [ ga rásaí ] [ /ˈɾˠaːsˠiː/ ] [ ga rása ] [ /ˈɾˠaːsˠə/ ] [ ga rásaí ] [ /ˈɾˠaːsˠiː/ ] (m.) &quot; race &quot; Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Dative Genitive Feminine nouns in -áint and -úint lose their t in the gen. sg.; those in -irt have -th- instead of -t- in the gen. sg. [ ga bagairt, bagartha, bagairtí ] [ ga canúint, canúna, canúintí ] (f.) &quot; threat &quot; (f.) &quot; dialect &quot; Many words in this declension form the plural with one of the endings -anna or -acha: [ ga am, ama, amanna ] [ /aːmˠ, ˈamˠə, ˈamˠən̪ˠə/ ] [ ga anam, anama, anamacha ] [ ga droim, droma, dromanna ] [ /d̪ˠɾˠiːmʲ, ˈd̪ˠɾˠumə, ˈd̪ˠɾˠumən̪ˠə/ ] [ ga loch, locha, lochanna ] [ ga troid, troda, troideanna ] (m.) &quot; time &quot; (m.) &quot; soul &quot; (m.) &quot; back &quot; (m.) &quot; lake &quot; (f.) &quot; fight, struggle &quot; Some words in Munster Irish also have a separate dative form: [ ga drom ] [ ga droim ] [ ga droma ] [ ga dromanna ] [ /d̪ˠɾˠoumˠ, d̪ˠɾˠiːmʲ, ˈd̪ˠɾˠomə, ˈd̪ˠɾˠomˠən̪ˠə/ ] nom., dat., gen., pl. (m.) &quot; back &quot; [ Fourth ] The fourth declension is made up of masculine and feminine nouns. It is characterized by a genitive singular that is identical in form to the nominative/vocative/dative singular. The singular may end in a vowel or a consonant (usually the diminutive suffix -ín). The most common plural ending is -(a)í. Singular Plural All cases Vowel or consonant (usually -ín) -(a)í [ ga balla ] [ ga balla ] [ /ˈbˠaɫ̪ə/ ] [ ga ballaí ] [ /ˈbˠaɫ̪iː/ ] (m.) &quot; wall &quot; Singular Plural All cases [ ga comhairle ] [ ga comhairle ] [ /ˈkoːɾˠlʲə/ ] [ ga comhairlí ] [ /ˈkoːɾˠlʲiː/ ] (f.) &quot; (piece of) advice &quot; Singular Plural All cases [ ga cailín ] [ ga cailín ] [ /ˈkalʲiːnʲ/ ] [ ga cailíní ] [ /ˈkalʲiːnʲiː/ ] (m.) &quot; girl &quot; Singular Plural All cases Many words of this declension form the plural with the following endings -tha/-t(h)e, -((e)a)nna or -((e)a)cha: [ ga ainmhí; ainmhithe ] [ ga aturnae; aturnaetha ] [ ga baile; bailte ] [ ga bus; busanna ] [ ga cliamhain; cliamhaineacha ] [ ga cneá; cneácha ] [ ga cnó; cnónna ] [ ga cró; cróite ] [ ga dlí; dlíthe ] [ ga dosaen; dosaenacha ] [ ga ga; gathanna ] [ ga gé; géanna ] [ ga léine; léine, léinte ] [ ga rá; ráite ] [ ga rí; ríthe ] [ ga sloinne; sloinnte ] [ /ˈsˠɫ̪ɪnʲə, ˈsˠɫ̪iːnʲtʲə/ ] [ ga teanga; teangacha ] [ ga tine; tinte ] (m.) &quot; animal &quot; (m.) &quot; attorney &quot; (m.) &quot; village &quot; (m.) &quot; bus &quot; (m.) &quot; son-in-law &quot; (f.) &quot; wound, sore &quot; (m.) &quot; nut &quot; (m.) &quot; outhouse; eye of a needle &quot; (m.) &quot; law &quot; (m.) &quot; dozen &quot; (m.) &quot; ray, radius &quot; (f.) &quot; goose &quot; (f.) &quot; shirt &quot; (m.) &quot; saying &quot; (m.) &quot; king &quot; (m.) &quot; last name &quot; (f.) &quot; language, tongue &quot; (f.) &quot; fire &quot; Other strong plural formations are found in: [ ga ainm; ainmneacha ] [ ga airí; airíona ] [ ga aithne; aitheanta ] [ ga bruach; bruacha ] [ ga cine; ciníocha ] [ ga duine; daoine ] [ ga gabha; gaibhne ] [ ga gnó; gnóthaí ] [ ga oíche; oícheanta ] (m.) &quot; name &quot; (m.) &quot; characteristic, symptom &quot; (f.) &quot; commandment &quot; (m.) &quot; bank (of river etc.) &quot; (m.) &quot; race, tribe &quot; (m.) &quot; person, human being &quot; (m.) &quot; blacksmith &quot; (m.) &quot; business &quot; (f.) &quot; night &quot; One noun in this class has a weak plural: [ ga bó, bó; ba, bó ] (f.) - cow [ Fifth ] The fifth declension is made up mostly of feminine nouns and is characterized by a genitive singular that ends in a broad consonant that has been added to the nominative/vocative/dative singular. The most common plural is weak, formed by adding -a to the genitive singular. Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Dative Vowel or slender consonant Gen. sg. + -a Genitive broad consonant Gen. sg. + -a [ ga pearsa ] [ ga pearsa ] [ /ˈpʲaɾˠsˠə/ ] [ ga pearsana ] [ /ˈpʲaɾˠsˠən̪ˠə/ ] [ ga pearsan ] [ /ˈpʲaɾˠsˠən̪ˠ/ ] [ ga pearsana ] [ /ˈpʲaɾˠsˠən̪ˠə/ ] &quot; person &quot; Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Dative Genitive [ ga cathair ] [ ga cathair ] [ /ˈkahəɾʲ/ ] [ ga cathracha ] [ /ˈkaɾˠəxə/ ] [ ga cathrach ] [ /ˈkaɾˠəx/ ] [ ga cathracha ] [ /ˈkaɾˠəxə/ ] &quot; city &quot; Singular Plural Nominative/Vocative/Dative Genitive In some Munster Irish varieties as well as the old literary language, the dative singular is distinct and ends in a slender consonant (in effect the dative sg. is formed by palatalizing the genitive sg.), for example, [ ga do phearsain ] &quot; to a person &quot;, [ ga ón gcathraigh ] &quot; from the city &quot;. In [ ga Éire, Éireann ] &quot; Ireland &quot; the dative [ ga Éirinn ] is still used in the standard language. Some words form the genitive singular by changing the final consonant of the nominative singular to broad. The plural is then strong -eacha. [ ga abhainn, abhann, aibhneacha ] [ /aunʲ, aun̪ˠ, ˈavʲnʲəxə/ ] [ ga athair, athar, aithreacha ] [ ga deartháir, dearthár, deartháireacha ] [ /ˈdʲɾʲahaːɾʲ, ˈdʲɾʲahaːɾˠ, ˈdʲɾʲahaːɾʲəxə/ ] [ ga máthair, máthar, máithreacha ] &quot; river &quot; (m.) &quot; father &quot; (m.) &quot; brother &quot; &quot; mother &quot; Other strong plural formations are found in: [ ga bráthair, bráthar; bráithre ] [ ga cara, carad; cairde ] [ /ˈkaɾˠə, ˈkaɾˠəd̪ˠ; ˈkaːɾˠdʲə/ ] [ ga namhaid, namhad; naimhde ] [ ga Nollaig, Nollag; Nollaigí ] (m.) &quot; brother (monk), friar &quot; (m.) &quot; friend &quot; (m.) &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; Christmas &quot; Some nouns have weak plurals; here the genitive singular and genitive plural have the same form: [ ga caora, caorach; caoirigh, caorach ] [ ga lacha, lachan; lachain, lachan ] - sheep - duck [ Verbal nouns ] The most productive verbal noun s end with -(e)adh (1st conjugation) or -(i)ú (2nd conjugation). These originally belonged to the third declension, but synchronically are best regarded as separate declensions. The 1st conjugation verbal noun in -(e)adh has a genitive singular in -te/-ta and a plural in -t(a)í. [ ga briseadh, briste; bristí ] [ ga moladh, molta; moltaí ] &quot; breaking &quot; &quot; praising; recommendation &quot; The 2nd conjugation verbal noun in -(i)ú has a genitive singular in -(a)ithe and a plural in -(u)ithe. These endings are pronounced the same regardless of the spelling distinction. [ ga scrúdú, scrúdaithe; scrúduithe ] [ ga síniú, sínithe; sínithe ] &quot; examining, examination &quot; &quot; stretching &quot; [ Irregular nouns ] The following nouns are declined irregularly: [ ga bean, mná; mná, ban ] [ ga deirfiúr, deirféar; deirfiúracha ] [ /ˈdʲɾʲɛfʲuːɾˠ, ˈdʲɾʲɛfʲeːɾˠ, ˈdʲɾʲefʲuːɾˠəxə/ ] [ ga deoch, dí; deochanna ] [ /dʲɔx, dʲiː, ˈdʲɔxən̪ˠə/ ] [ ga Dia, Dé; déithe ] [ ga lá, lae; laethanta ] [ ga leaba, leapa; leapacha ] [ ga mí, míosa; míonna ] [ ga muir, mara; mara ] [ ga olann, olla ] [ ga talamh, talaimh ] [ ga talún ] [ ga tailte ] [ ga teach, tí; tithe ] (f.) &quot; woman &quot; (f.) &quot; sister &quot; (f.) &quot; drink &quot; (m.) &quot; God &quot; (m.) &quot; day &quot; (f.) &quot; bed &quot; (f.) &quot; month &quot; (f.) &quot; sea &quot; (f.) &quot; wool &quot; (m.) or (f.); &quot; land &quot; (m.) &quot; house &quot; [ Articles ] The definite article has two forms in Irish: [ ga an ] and [ ga na ]. Their distribution depends on whether the noun is singular or plural, the case of the noun, and the initial sound of the noun. Each entry of the table gives an example of a noun starting with a consonant and one of a noun starting with a vowel. [ ga an cat ] [ ga an t-éan ] [ ga an bhróg ] [ ga aneaglais ] [ ga (do) na cait ] [ ga (leis) na héin ] [ ga den chat ] [ ga sanéan ] [ ga don bhróg ] [ ga deneaglais ] [ ga ag an gcat ] [ ga ag anéan ] [ ga faoin mbróg ] [ ga tríd aneaglais ] [ ga an chait ] [ ga anéin ] [ ga na bróige ] [ ga na heaglaise ] [ ga na gcat ] [ ga na n-éin ] Singular Plural Masculine Feminine both genders Nominative Dative (i) Dative (ii) Genitive Dative (i) is used with all prepositions in Ulster usage; elsewhere it is used only with [ ga den ] &quot; from the &quot;, [ ga don ] &quot; to the &quot;, and [ ga sa(n) ] &quot; in the &quot;. Dative (ii) is used outside Ulster with other prepositions. The article never lenites a following [ ga t ] or [ ga d ], and an [ ga s ] is lenited to [ ga ts ] (pronounced [ t̪ˠ, tʲ ] ) rather than the usual [ ga sh ]. There is no indefinite article in Irish, so depending on context [ ga cat ] can mean &quot; cat &quot; or &quot; a cat &quot;. [ Adjectives ] Almost all adjective s in Irish can be used either predicatively or attributively. A predicative adjective is one that forms a part of the predicate, like red in the sentence The car is red. An attributive adjective directly modifies a noun, as in the red car. A predicate adjective in Irish does not inflect: [ ga Tá an fear sin beag. ] [ ga Tá na fir sin beag. ] [ ga Tá an bhean seo beag. ] [ ga Tá na mná seo beag. ] &quot; That man is small. &quot; &quot; Those men are small. &quot; &quot; This woman is small. &quot; &quot; These women are small. &quot; A predicate adjective expressing a value judgment is often preceded by the particle [ ga go ]. This particle attaches an h to a following vowel. [ ga Tá mé gomaith. ] [ ga Tá an scéal go holc. ] [ ga Bhí an aimsir go hálainn. ] &quot; I&apos;m fine &quot; (lit. &quot; I am good. &quot; ) &quot; The story is bad. &quot; &quot; The weather was beautiful. &quot; In Ulster, go is not generally used in these cases. An attributive adjective mostly follows the noun and is inflected: [ ga an fear beag ] [ ga an fhir bhig ] &quot; the small man &quot; &quot; of the small man &quot; (genitive) There are three classes of declension of adjectives in Irish, which correspond to the first four declensions of nouns: Nom. sg. ends with: Gen. sg. masc. ends with: Gen. sg. fem. ends with: 1st/2nd decl. slender or broad cons. slender consonant slender consonant + -e 3rd decl. slender cons.

Otherwise, the adjective in the nominative plural does not lenite: &quot; lame tailors &quot;. The long form of the genitive plural (e.g. ) is used when the noun has a strong plural, e.g. &quot; of lame mothers &quot;. The short form (e.g. ) is used when the noun has a weak plural, e.g. &quot; of lame cats &quot;. The dative has the same form as the nominative. The vocative has the same form as the nominative except in the masculine singular of the 1st/2nd declension, where it has the same form as the genitive. [ Comparative ] Irish adjectives have a comparative form equivalent to the comparative and to the superlative in English. The comparative does not undergo inflexion and is the same as the feminine singular genitive in regular and many irregular adjectives.

The preterite of the copula causes lenition, while the present tense does not. [ ga Ba thréine Cáit ná Cathal. ] [ ga Is airde Seán ná mise. ] [ ga B&apos;óige an madra ná an cat. ] [ ga Is fearr Gaeilge bhriste ná Béarla cliste. ] &quot; Cáit was stronger than Cathal. &quot; &quot; Seán is bigger than me. &quot; &quot; The dog was younger than the cat. &quot; &quot; Broken Irish is better than clever English. &quot; 2) [ ga níos/ní ba/ní b’ ] + comparative + [ ga ná ] + predicate. [ ga Níos ] is used if the sentence is in the present or future tense. [ ga Ní ba/ní b’ ], which triggers lenition, is used if the sentence is in the past tense. [ ga Ní b’ ] is used before words starting with vowels and [ ga ní ba ] before those starting with consonants. [ ga Tá an ghrian níos gile ná an ghealach. ] [ ga Beidh Peadar níos saibhre ná a athair. ] [ ga D&apos;éirigh Peadar ní ba shaibhre ná a athair. ] [ ga Bhí Seán ní b’airde ná mise. ] &quot; The sun is brighter than the moon. &quot; &quot; Peadar will be richer than his father. &quot; &quot; Peadar became richer than his father. &quot; &quot; Seán was bigger than me. &quot; A superlative is expressed as a relative clause: noun + [ ga is/ba/ab ] + comparative form. [ ga an cailín is tréine ] [ ga an cailín ba thréine ] [ ga an buachaill is óige ] [ ga an buachaill ab óige ] &quot; the strongest girl &quot; (lit. &quot; the girl who is the strongest &quot; ) &quot; the strongest girl &quot; (lit. &quot; the girl who was/would be the strongest &quot; ) &quot; the youngest boy &quot; (lit. &quot; the boy who is the youngest &quot; ) &quot; the youngest boy &quot; (lit. &quot; the boy who was/would be the youngest &quot; ) [ References ] [ Christian Brothers New Irish Grammar C.  J.
