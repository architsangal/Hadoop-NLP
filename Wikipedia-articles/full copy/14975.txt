The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group. [ http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/ivy_league.html Princeton Campus Guide – Ivy League 2007-04-26 ] The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University. The term Ivy League also has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism. The term became official after the formation of the NCAA Division  I athletic conference in 1954.

[ http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/ivy_league.shtml What is the origin of the term, Ivy League? 2006-05-17 ] Seven of the eight schools were founded during the United States colonial period; the exception is Cornell, which was founded in 1865. Ivy League institutions, therefore, account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Ivy League schools are often viewed by the public as some of the most prestigious and are often ranked amongst the best universities in the United States and worldwide.

All eight schools receive millions of dollars in research grants and other subsidies from federal and state government. Undergraduate enrollments among the Ivy League schools range from about 4,000 to 14,000, { Dartmouth and } { Cornell respectively } making them larger than those of a typical private liberal arts college and smaller than a typical public state university. Overall enrollments range from approximately 5,900 in the case of Dartmouth to over 20,000 in the case of Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and Penn.

It was nameless for its first two years 1636 as New College Calvinist ( Congregationalist puritan s ) Yale University 1701 as Collegiate School Calvinist ( Congregationalists ) University of Pennsylvania 1740 as Church and Charity School of Philadelphia See University of Pennsylvania for details of the circumstances of Penn&apos;s origin. Penn considered its founding date to be 1749 for over a century. In 1895, elite universities in the United States agreed that henceforth formal academic procession s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution&apos;s founding dates. Penn&apos;s periodical &quot; The Alumni Register &quot; then began a grassroots campaign to retroactively revise the university&apos;s founding date to 1740, in order to appear older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. In 1899, the Board of Trustees acceded to the alumni initiative and voted to change the founding date to 1740. Nonsectarian, Penn&apos;s website, like other sources, makes an important point of Penn&apos;s heritage being nonsectarian, associated with Benjamin Franklin and the Academy of Philadelphia&apos;s nonsectarian board of trustees: &quot; The goal of Franklin&apos;s nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen. &quot;. Jencks and Riesman (2001) write &quot; The Anglicans who founded the University of Pennsylvania, however, were evidently anxious not to alienate Philadelphia&apos;s Quakers, and they made their new college officially nonsectarian. &quot; In Franklin&apos;s 1749 founding Proposals relating to the education of youth in Pensilvania (page images), religion is not mentioned directly as a subject of study, but he states in a footnote that the study of &quot; History will also afford frequent Opportunities of showing the Necessity of a Publick Religion, from its Usefulness to the Publicks; the Advantage of a Religious Character among private Persons; the Mischiefs of Superstition, &amp; c. and the Excellency of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION above all others antient or modern. &quot; Starting in 1751, the same trustees also operated a Charity School for Boys, whose curriculum combined &quot; general principles of Christianity &quot; with practical instruction leading toward careers in business and the &quot; mechanical arts. &quot;, and thus might be described as &quot; non-denominational Christian. &quot; The charity school was originally planned and a trust was organized on paper in 1740 by followers of travelling evangelist George Whitefield. The school was to have operated inside a church supported by the same group of adherents. But the organizers ran short of financing and, although the frame of the building was raised, the interior was left unfinished. The founders of the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the unused building in 1750 for their new venture and, in the process, assumed the original trust. Since 1899, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the organizational date of the charity school and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with The Great Awakening; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labelled Episcopalian, and in fact Brown University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn&apos;s origin as &quot; Episcopalian &quot;. Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called &quot; Quakers, &quot; and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the &quot; Quaker Consortium. &quot; ) But Penn&apos;s website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historic or otherwise, and Haverford College implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that &quot; Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America. &quot; founded by Church of England / Methodists members Princeton University 1746 as College of New Jersey Nonsectarian, founded by Calvinist s ( Presbyterians ) University Chapel: Orange Key Virtual Tour of Princeton University Columbia University 1754 as King&apos;s College Church of England Brown University 1764 as the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations Baptist, founding charter promises &quot; no religious tests &quot; and &quot; full liberty of conscience &quot; Brown&apos;s website characterizes it as &quot; the Baptist answer to Congregationalist Yale and Harvard; Presbyterian Princeton; and Episcopalian Penn and Columbia, &quot; but adds that at the time it was &quot; the only one that welcomed students of all religious persuasions. &quot; Brown&apos;s charter stated that &quot; into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience. &quot; The charter called for twenty-two of the thirty-six trustees to be Baptists, but required that the remainder be &quot; five Friends, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians &quot; Dartmouth College 1769 Calvinist ( Congregationalist ) Cornell University 1865 Nonsectarian [ Hughes Samuel 2002 http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html Whiskey, Loose Women, and Fig Leaves: The University&apos;s seal has a curious history Pennsylvania Gazette 100 3 ] Note: Six of the eight Ivy League universities consider their founding dates to be simply the date that they received their charters and thus became legal corporations with the authority to grant academic degrees. Harvard University uses the date that the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony formally allocated funds for the creation of a college. The University of Pennsylvania initially considered its founding date to be 1750; this is the year which appears on the first iteration of the university seal. Sometime in Penn&apos;s early history, it began to refer to 1749 as its founding date; this year was used for over a century. In 1899, the university&apos;s Board of Trustees voted to change the founding date again, this time to 1740, in order to make their institution appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. &quot; Religious affiliation &quot; refers to financial sponsorship, formal association with, and promotion by, a religious denomination. All of the schools in the Ivy League are private and not currently associated with any religion. [ Origin of the name ] Students have long revered the ivied walls of older colleges. &quot; Planting the ivy &quot; was a customary class day ceremony at many colleges in the late 1800s. In 1893 an alumnus told the Harvard Crimson, &quot; In 1850, class day was placed upon the University Calendar.... the custom of planting the ivy, while the ivy oration was delivered, arose about this time. &quot; [ Class Day, New and Old http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1893/6/3/class-day-old-and-new-it-is/?print%3D1 ] Ivy planting ceremonies are reported for Yale, { Boston Daily Globe, Jun 27, 1882, p. 4: &quot; CLASS DAY.: Yale Seniors Plant the Ivy, Sing &quot; Blage, &quot; and Entertain the Beauty of New Haven; &quot; } Simmons, { Boston Evening Transcript, Jun 11, 1912, p. 12, &quot; Simmons Seniors Hosts Class Day Exercises Late in Afternoon, Planting of the Ivy will be One of the Features; } Bryn Mawr [ Play a Romance and Plant Ivy, Pretty Class Day Exercises of the Women&apos;s College http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid%3D1126%26amp%3Bdat%3D19070609%26amp%3Bid%3DuXpRAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bsjid%3DkWcDAAAAIBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3D4741%2C1858451 ] and many others. Princeton&apos;s &quot; Ivy Club &quot; was founded in 1879. [ The Ivy Club: History http://theivyclub.net/history/ ] The first usage of Ivy in reference to a group of colleges is from sportswriter Stanley Woodward (1895–1965). [ A proportion of our eastern ivy colleges are meeting little fellows another Saturday before plunging into the strife and the turmoil. Stanley Woodward, New York Tribune, October 14, 1933, describing the football season &quot; Yale Book of Quotations &quot; (2006) Yale University Press edited by Fred R. Shapiro ] According to the book Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins (1988), author William Morris writes that Stanley Woodward actually took the term from fellow New York Tribune sportswriter Caswell Adams. Morris writes that during the 1930s, the Fordham University football team was running roughshod over all its opponents. One day in the sports room at the Tribune, the merits of Fordham&apos;s football team were being compared to those of Princeton and Columbia. Adams remarked disparagingly of the latter two, saying they were &quot; only Ivy League. &quot; Woodward, the sports editor of the Tribune, picked up the term and printed the next day. Note though that in the above quote Woodward used the term ivy college, not ivy league as Adams is said to have used, so there is a discrepancy in this theory, although it seems certain the term ivy college and shortly later Ivy League acquired its name from the sports world. The first known instance of the term Ivy League being used appeared in The Christian Science Monitor on February 7, 1935. { &quot; The Yale Book of Quotations &quot; (2006) } { Yale University Press, edited by Fred R. Shapiro } { Oxford English Dictionary entry for &quot; Ivy League &quot; } { Ivy League Sports } [ January 2011 ] Several sportswriters and other journalists used the term shortly later to refer to the older colleges, those along the northeastern seaboard of the United States, chiefly the nine institutions with origins dating from the colonial era, together with the United States Military Academy (West Point), the United States Naval Academy, and a few others. These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions would make efforts to form an athletic league. Ivy covering West College, Princeton University The Ivy League universities are also called the &quot; Ancient Eight &quot; or simply the Ivies. A common folk etymology attributes the name to the Roman numerals for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed &quot; IV League &quot; was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a 4th school that varies depending on who is telling the story. { The } { Chicago Public Library reports the &quot; IV League &quot; explanation, } [ January 2011 ] { sourced only from the Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins. } { Various Ask Ezra student columns report the &quot; IV League &quot; explanation, apparently relying on the Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins as the sole source: } [ http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html The Penn Current / October 17, 2002 / Ask Benny Upenn.edu 2011-01-30 ] However, it is clear that Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Columbia met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of football, which rapidly spread. [ http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html This according to the Penn history of varsity football Archives.upenn.edu 2011-01-30 ] In addition, representatives from four schools: Rutgers, Princeton, Yale, and Columbia, met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in Manhattan on October 19, 1873, to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate athletic competition, and particularly to codify the new game of college football (which at the time, largely resembled what is currently called rugby ). [ http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp Rutgers – The Birthplace of Intercollegiate Football Scarletknights.com 1938-11-05 2011-01-30 ] Though invited, Harvard chose not to attend. While no formal organization or conference was established, the results of this meeting governed athletic events between these schools well into the 20th century. { Encyclopædia Britannica } [ January 2011 ] {.

Retrieved 10 September 2006. } [ Before there was an Ivy League ] Seven of the Ivy League schools were founded before the American Revolution; Cornell was founded just after the American Civil War. These seven provided the overwhelming majority of the higher education in the Northern and Middle Colonies; their early faculties and founding boards were largely, therefore, drawn from other Ivy League institutions; there were also some British graduates from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, the University of Edinburgh, and elsewhere. Similarly, the founder of The College of William &amp; Mary, in 1693, was a British graduate of the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided Stanford University with its first president. The influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the first two decades of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801 a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the University of South Carolina were Princeton alumni. They appointed Jonathan Maxcy, a Brown graduate, as the university&apos;s first president. Thomas Cooper, an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the University of California came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California are Yale Blue and California Gold. [ http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html Resource: Student history Resource.berkeley.edu 2011-01-30 ] Some of the Ivy League schools have identifiable Protestant roots, while others were founded as nonsectarian schools. Church of England King&apos;s College broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian Columbia College. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown&apos;s charter promised no religious tests and &quot; full liberty of conscience &quot;, but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding. &quot; Ivy League &quot; is sometimes used as a way of referring to an elite class, even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This sense dates back to at least 1935.

After the Second World War, the present Ivy League institutions slowly widened their selection of students. They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with doctorate s had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly. { scandals: James Axtell, The Making of Princeton University (2006), p.274; quoting a former executive director of the Ivy League } [ History of the athletic league ] The Ivies have been competing in sports as long as intercollegiate sports have existed in the United States. Rowing teams from Harvard and Yale met in the first sporting event held between students of two U.S. colleges on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, on August 3, 1852. Harvard&apos;s team, &quot; The Oneida &quot;, won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then presidential nominee General Franklin Pierce. { Palestra, Penn&apos;s basketball arena } The first formal athletic league involving eventual Ivy League schools (or any US colleges, for that matter) was created in 1870 with the formation of the Rowing Association of American Colleges. The RAAC hosted a de-facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870–1894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Pennsylvania founded the Intercollegiate Rowing Association, which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete. A basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League; they were later joined by Penn, Dartmouth and Brown. In 1906, the organization that eventually became the National Collegiate Athletic Association was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Pennsylvania) later became Ivies. Before the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an &quot; unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations &quot;. In 1935, the Associated Press reported on an example of collaboration between the schools: [ Associated Press Colleges Searching for Check On Trend to Goal Post Riots The New York Times 33 1935-12-06 ] Despite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. Romeyn Berry, Cornell&apos;s manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows: [ Robert F. Kelley Cornell Club Here Welcomes Lynah The New York Times 22 1936-01-17 ] Within a year of this statement and having held one-month-long discussions about the proposal, on December 3, 1936, the idea of &quot; the formation of an Ivy League &quot; gained enough traction among the undergraduate bodies of the universities that the Columbia Daily Spectator, The Cornell Daily Sun, The Dartmouth, The Harvard Crimson, The Daily Pennsylvanian, The Daily Princetonian and the Yale Daily News would simultaneously run an editorial entitled &quot; Now Is the Time &quot;, encouraging the seven universities to form the league in an effort to preserve the ideals of athletics. [ Immediate Formation of Ivy League Advocated at Seven Eastern Colleges The New York Times 33 1936-12-03 ] Part of the editorial read as follows: [ http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref%3D456169 The Harvard Crimson :: News :: AN EDITORIAL Thecrimson.com 1936-12-03 2011-01-30 ] The proposal did not succeed—on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the &quot; possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track. &quot; However, they noted that the league &quot; has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration. &quot; [ Plea for an Ivy Football League Rejected by College Authorities The New York Times 26 1937-01-12 ] In 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first Ivy Group Agreement, which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the football teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents&apos; Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant&apos;s ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions: [ Gwertzman Bernard M. http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref%3D128992 The Harvard Crimson &apos; &amp; #39;Ivy League: Formalizing the Fact&apos; &amp; #39; Saturday, October 13, 1956 Thecrimson.com 1956-10-13 2011-01-30 ] In 1954, the date generally accepted as the birth of the Ivy League, the presidents extended the Ivy Group Agreement to all intercollegiate sports. Competition began with the 1956 season. As late as the 1960s many of the Ivy League universities&apos; undergraduate programs remained open only to men, with Cornell the only one to have been coeducational from its founding (1865) and Columbia being the last (1983) to become coeducation al. Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby Seven Sisters women&apos;s college s, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle. This was the case not only at Barnard College and Radcliffe College, which are adjacent to Columbia and Harvard, but at more distant institutions as well. The movie Animal House includes a satiric version of the formerly common visits by Dartmouth men to Massachusetts to meet Smith and Mount Holyoke women, a drive of more than two hours. As noted by Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra, &quot; The &apos; Seven Sisters&apos; was the name given to Barnard, Smith, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, and Radcliffe, because of their parallel to the Ivy League men’s colleges. &quot; [ http://www.ed.gov/offices/OERI/PLLI/webreprt.html Archived: Women&apos;s Colleges in the United States: History, Issues, and Challenges Ed.gov 2011-01-30 ] In 1983, following the admission of women to Columbia College, Columbia University and Barnard College entered into an athletic consortium agreement by which students from both schools compete together on Columbia University women&apos;s athletic teams, which replaced the women&apos;s teams previously sponsored by Barnard. [ Cohesiveness of the group ] The Ivy League schools are highly selective, with acceptance rates ranging from 6 to 16 percent. [ http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities National University Rankings U.S.News &amp; World Report LP 2011-05-11 ] These universities compete in many ways, as illustrated by Yale&apos;s aggressive reaction to an incident in 2002. A Princeton admissions staffer mentioned at a joint meeting of all eight Ivy admissions departments that he and others from his office had logged onto the Yale admissions website to see how their system to notify applicants worked. At the time, Princeton and many other colleges were considering a transition from traditional snail mail to website notification, a process which Yale had already completed. No immediate reaction from the group resulted at the initial meeting, as was the case when the same individual brought up the subject again at a subsequent conference one month later. He told the others present that he and his colleagues had used the names, birth dates and Social Security number s of some Princeton applicants who might have also applied to Yale. In particular, the Princeton representative brought up the topic because he was surprised to find that Yale had used no password besides a Social Security number. Despite the fact that the Princeton staffer had proactively volunteered the information and Yale officials at both meetings had voiced no objection, the Yale administration examined its computer records and called the FBI to complain that its computers had been &quot; hacked, &quot; then issued a press release to that effect. After this apparent attempt to embarrass Princeton publicly, the admissions official at the center of the controversy was moved to a different department and the university&apos;s dean of admissions Fred Hargadon retired at the end of the academic year, though Princeton president Shirley Tilghman said that the dean&apos;s decision to retire was unconnected to the incident. [ http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2002/05/17/news/5201.shtml Princeton removes LeMenager from admission office for violations The Daily Princetonian 2011-01-30 ] In 2007, Princeton honored the dean by naming a new campus dormitory after him. Collaboration between the member schools is illustrated by the student-led Ivy Council that meets in the fall and spring of each year, with representatives from every Ivy League school. [ Social elitism ] The phrase Ivy League historically has been perceived as connected not only with academic excellence, but also with social elitism. In 1936, sportswriter John Kieran noted that student editors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Penn were advocating the formation of an athletic association. In urging them to consider &quot; Army and Navy and Georgetown and Fordham and Syracuse and Brown and Pitt &quot; as candidates for membership, he exhorted: A cartoon portrait of the stereotypical Columbia man in the 20th century [ It would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not &quot; exclusive &quot; as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose. Kieran, John (1936), &quot; Sports of the Times &quot;, The New York Times, December 4, 1936, p. 36. &quot; There will now be a little test of the &quot; the power of the press &quot; in intercollegiate circles since the student editors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth and Penn are coming out in a group for the formation of an Ivy League in football. The idea isn&apos;t new.... It would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not &quot; exclusive &quot; as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose. &quot; He recommended the consideration of &quot; plenty of institutions covered with home-grown ivy that are not included in the proposed group. [such as ] Army and Navy and Georgetown and Fordham and Syracuse and Brown and Pitt, just to offer a few examples that come to mind &quot; and noted that &quot; Pitt and Georgetown and Brown and Bowdoin and Rutgers were old when Cornell was shining new, and Fordham and Holy Cross had some building draped in ivy before the plaster was dry in the walls that now tower high about Cayuga&apos;s waters. &quot; ] The Ivy League has sometimes been associated with the WASP community.

Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and elitism &quot; and said Harvard in his remark was intended to represent &quot; a philosophical enclave &quot; and not a statement about class. { Dowd, Maureen (1998), &quot; Bush Traces How Yale Differs From Harvard. &quot; The New York Times, June 11, 1998, p. 10 } Columnist Russell Baker opined that &quot; Voters inclined to loathe and fear elite Ivy League schools rarely make fine distinctions between Yale and Harvard.

Bush (Yale undergrad, Harvard Business School), and Barack Obama (Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School). [ Cooperation ] Up until recently, seven of the eight schools (Harvard excluded) participated in the Borrow Direct interlibrary loan program, making a total of 88 million items available to participants with a waiting period of four working days. { Columbia&apos;s Borrow Direct website } This ILL program is not affiliated with the formal Ivy arrangement. Harvard and MIT joined the Direct Borrow partnership in January 2011, together contributing over 70 million books to the existing collection.

During their meetings, the presidents often discuss common procedures and initiatives. [ Competition and athletics ] { Cornell Big Red } { college baseball player from 1908. } Ivy champions are recognized in 33 men&apos;s and women&apos;s sports. In some sports, Ivy teams actually compete as members of another league, the Ivy championship being decided by isolating the members&apos; records in play against each other; for example, the six league members who participate in ice hockey do so as members of ECAC Hockey, but an Ivy champion is extrapolated each year. Unlike all other Division I basketball conferences, the Ivy League has no tournament for the league title; { May The Madness Begin by Mark Starr } { Newsweek.com; March 14, 2002. Retrieved January 25, 2008. } the school with the best conference record represents the conference in the Division I NCAA Basketball Tournament (with a playoff, or playoffs, in the case of a tie). [ http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2002/03/06/yale-basketball-shares-ivy-league-title/ Yale basketball shares Ivy League title Yale Daily News 2002-03-06 2010-08-01 ] Since its inception, an Ivy League school has yet to win either the men&apos;s or women&apos;s Division I NCAA Basketball Tournament. On average, each Ivy school has more than 35 varsity teams. All eight are in the top 20 for number of sports offered for both men and women among Division I schools.Unlike most Division I athletic conferences, the Ivy League prohibits the granting of athletic scholarships; all scholarships awarded are need-based ( financial aid ). { Ivy League Sports } [ January 2011 ] Ivy League teams&apos; non-league games are usually against the members of the Patriot League, which have similar academic standards and athletic scholarship policies. In the time before recruiting for college sports became dominated by those offering athletic scholarships and lowered academic standards for athletes, the Ivy League was successful in many sports relative to other universities in the country. In particular, Princeton won 24 recognized national championships in college football (last in 1911), and Yale won 19 (last in 1927). Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as Alabama, which has won 13, Notre Dame, which has won 12, and USC, which has won 11. Yale, whose coach Walter Camp was the &quot; Father of American Football, &quot; held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire 20th century, but was finally passed by Michigan on November 10, 2001. Currently Dartmouth holds the record for most Ivy League football titles, with 17. Beginning with the 1982 football season, the Ivy League has competed in Division I-AA (renamed FCS in 2006). { New York Times – 2006-11-17 } The Ivy League teams are eligible for the FCS tournament held to determine the national champion, and the league champion receives an automatic bid (and any other team may qualify for an at-large selection) from the NCAA. Through the 2009 season, all eligible teams have declined the invitation, citing rules governing the league&apos;s academic concerns posed by the extended December schedule. The Ivy League plays a strict 10 game schedule, compared to other FCS members&apos; schedules of 11 or 12 regular season games, plus post-season, which was expanded in 2010 to five rounds with 20 teams, with a bye week for the top 12 teams. Football is the only sport in which the Ivy League declines to compete for a national title. { Yale Bowl during } { The Game. } Although no longer as successful nationally as they once were in many of the more popular college sports, the Ivy League is still competitive in others. One such example is rowing. All of the Ivies have historically been among the top crews in the nation, and most continue to be so today. Cornell&apos;s 38 national championships in men&apos;s rowing makes that program perhaps the most decorated varsity athletic program in the country in any sport. Most recently, on the men&apos;s side, Harvard won the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships in 2003, 2004, 2005, and on the women&apos;s side Brown won the team championship in 2007, 2008 and 2011 NCAA Rowing Championships and Yale won the NCAA title for the I-eight event (the most elite event) in 2007, 2008 and 2010. Additionally, Cornell&apos;s men&apos;s lightweight team won back to back to back IRA National Championships in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Ivy League schools are also very competitive in men&apos;s lacrosse and both men&apos;s and women&apos;s hockey. The Ivy League is home to some of the oldest college rugby teams. These teams meet annually to compete in a tourney. The 2006 Ivy League Tournament was hosted by Yale, and the 2005 tournament was hosted by Penn. Though the women&apos;s rugby teams at the Ivy League schools are much younger, they too compete in an annual Ivy League Tournament, often hosted by Brown. [ Internal rivalries ] Rivalries run deep in the Ivy League. For instance, Harvard and Yale are celebrated football and crew rivals.

Penn has won 21 outright, Princeton 18 outright. Princeton has been a co-champion 7 times, sharing 4 of those titles with Penn (these 4 seasons represent the only times Penn has been co-champion). Princeton and Harvard are the reigning (2011) Ivy League men&apos;s basketball co-champions. Rivalries exist between other Ivy league teams in other sports, including Cornell and Harvard in hockey (the only two League members to have won the NCAA tournament), Harvard and Princeton in swimming, and Harvard and Penn in football (Penn and Harvard have each had two unbeaten seasons since 2001). { Ivy League Football } [ January 2011 ] In men&apos;s lacrosse, Cornell and Princeton are perennial rivals, and they are the only two Ivy League teams to have won the NCAA tournament. In 2009, the Big Red and Tigers met for their 70th game in the NCAA tournament. { New wrinkle in the Cornell Princeton lacrosse rivalry, } { The Ithaca Journal, May 16, 2009. } No team other than Harvard or Princeton has won the men&apos;s swimming conference title outright since 1972, although Yale, Columbia, and Cornell have shared the title with Harvard and Princeton during this time.
