System. The U.P. Diliman campus is connected to Commonwealth Avenue via the University Avenue. It stretches 800 meters where traffic enters the campus, or proceeds towards C.P. Garcia St., which connects Commonwealth Avenue to Katipunan Avenue. At the end of University Avenue, the Oblation Plaza of the Diliman campus faces the road. Behind it, the facade of Quezon Hall can be seen. [ Oblation (University of the Philippines) ] The Oblation statue ( [ Pahinungod/Oblasyon ] ) is the most iconic figure of the U.P. System. The statue was originally created by National Artist Guillermo E. Tolentino in 1935 in a collective effort by the students of the U.P. System. During the 40th anniversary of the University of the Philippines, the Oblation was transferred to Diliman in Quezon City from their original site along Padre Faura St. in Manila as a symbol of transfer of administrative seat. The Oblation was originally naked and made of concrete and stands 3.5 meters in height.

Tolentino made a trip to Italy to personally supervise the casting of his old masterpiece into bronze. [ Symbolic Link: The Oblation UP Today: UP Alumni Magazine 1967 Loredo, Angioline A. 14–15 ] The bronze statue, unveiled on 29 November 1958, is now housed at Gonzalez Hall where the University Library is also located. [ Defeo Ruben D.F. 100 Nudes/100 Years 2008 UP Alumni Association Quezon City 978-971-94174-0-8 ] Several replicas of Tolentino&apos;s Oblation statue were created during the creation of new U.P. campuses, some were made by the National Artist Napoleon Abueva. U.P. Diliman&apos;s Oblation statue located in the Oblation Plaza is also a concrete-made replica of Tolentino&apos;s. The main and largest road in the university is the Academic Oval, informally known as &quot; Acad Oval. &quot; This road is composed of two joining avenues, the Roxas and Osmeña Avenues. Having a total circumference of about 2.2 kilometers, the oval connects the rest of the colleges of the university from the main University Avenue. The avenue derives its name from several colleges located around it, namely the College of Mass Communication, College of Music, College of Engineering, College of Law, School of Economics, College of Business Administration, College of Education, College of Social Sciences and Philosophy and School of Library and Information Studies. The oval also covers Quezon Hall, the U.P. Theater, National Engineering Center, Student Activity Center/Vinzons Hall, Center for International Studies and Jorge B. Vargas Museum.

Carillon was originally constructed in 1940 by National Artist Juan Nakpil, Conservatory of Music director Ramon Tapales and UP President Bienvenido Gonzales with an initial idea of building a concrete structure that may tower the grounds of the university. [ Santiago Bettina For UP the bells toll http://www.mb.com.ph/node/54306 8 August 2010 Manila Bulletin 20 December 2007 ] Several years later, on 1 August 1952, the tower was finished and dedicated as the U.P. Carillon. Forty-eight bells with four octave s were installed by the Dutch carilloneeur Adrian Antonisse, with the efforts laid by the U.P. Alumni Association. These bells were forged by Van Bergen Co. in Netherlands and the largest of them weighs five tons, where the total cost of construction summed up to ₱ 200,000. [ History of UP Carillon http://www.upcarillon.org/history.html The University of the Philippines Carillon Tower Restoration Project 8 August 2010 ] Apart from playing the U.P.&apos;s anthem UP Naming Mahal (U.P. Beloved), the Carillon tuned many music such as the Magtanim ay Di Biro (Planting Rice, a Filipino folk song) and The Beatles sounds. One of the most important tunings of the Carillon was when it played the socialist anthem The Internationale at the 1971 Diliman Commune.

In 1988, the last symphonies of U.P. Naming Mahal and Push On U.P.! (U.P. Diliman&apos;s athletic cheer) from the tower was played during the December&apos;s Lantern Parade. Since then, the Carillon was never tuned. But as late as 2001, students say that they can hear the rhymes of London Bridge Is Falling Down and Sing a Song of Six Pence despite that it was closed to prevent further mishaps. In 2005, through the collective efforts of the U.P. Alumni Association and various private donors, the U.P. Carillon Restoration Project of the U.P. Centennial Commission launched a fund-raising program to collect ₱ 20 million to restore the Carillon, as a projection of using the tower again in the coming 100th year of the University of the Philippines. [ History of UP Carillon http://www.upcarillon.org/about_project.html The University of the Philippines Carillon Tower Restoration Project 8 August 2010 ] After two years, the Project was able to collect ₱ 14 million which will be used to clean-up and repair the tower itself and to replace the bells.

The original 48 bells were put into archives and are now replaced by 36 bells bought from Dutch company Petit and Fritsen for ₱ 12 million whereas the construction engineers were provided by the Royal Bell Philippines. According to project engineer Matthew Bergers, each bell was made from 80% bronze and 20% combination of zinc, magnesium and phosphorus. At the same time, the largest of these bells weighs 635 kilograms and the smallest weighs 14 kilograms. The original wood claviers were replaced by heavy duty oakwood while all bells are designed to hold refurbished steel pipes. Another project engineer Eduardo Otacan also said that the new bells will have 3 octaves and they can be programmed using computers attached to the clavier. At the same time, a small amphitheater named Carillon Plaza was constructed at the base of the tower. After about two decades of silence, the U.P. Carillon was heard again during the Lantern Parade of 2007. [ Sunken Garden ] &quot; Sunken Garden &quot; redirects here. For other uses, see Sunken Gardens. The Sunken Garden in U.P. Diliman during the wet months The Sunken Garden during the summer The Gen. Antonio Luna Parade Grounds, or commonly known as the Sunken Garden, is a 5-hectare natural depression found on the eastern side of the campus and at the end of the Academic Oval circle. Sunken Garden is enclosed by the U.P. Diliman Main Library (also houses the School of Library and Information Studies), College of Social Sciences and Philosophy&apos;s Department of Psychology, College of Education, Student Activity Center/ Vinzons Hall, College of Business Administration, School of Economics and College of Law. The Grounds was the original property of the UP-ROTC when the campus was founded in 1949. [ General Antonio Luna Parade Grounds http://www.uprotc.org/facility/gen-antonio-luna-parade-grounds.html UP ROTC 8 August 2010 ] Gen. Antonio Luna Parade Grounds acquired its name Sunken Garden due to its basin-shaped low-level formation that has the deepest point of 65 meters above sea level (contrary to university&apos;s height of over hundreds of meters above sea level). [ Sarmiento Christine Joy The truth behind the myth http://dilimangenius.webs.com/maharlagmay.htm UP College of Mass Communication 8 August 2010 ] The Sunken Garden is usually the venue for sports tournament like frisbee, football, and volleyball clinics as well as the annual U.P. Fair. Sometimes, ROTC trainings are done here by the Department of Military Science and Tactics. The Latagaw Cup, one of the famous activities held in the Sunken Garden, is a competition created by a U.P. fraternity, the U.P. Latagaw Brotherhood, wherein they play a game of football on the green grass fields. It often compliments the frisbee sport which is also regularly held at the Sunken. This was conceptualized sometime in 1980 after the famous World Cup being played every four years in Europe. The Sunken Garden actually sinks by about two inches every year. There are two possible reasons of this sinking: first, it is because of underground trenches that mingle with the campus&apos; sewer system. These trenches branch from the rear side of NIGS building, Sampaguita Residence Hall, the U.P. Integrated School, down to the National Institute of Physics, until near the former Narra Residence Hall. These trenches then connects to the so-called Marikina Fault Line, an active geologic structure that runs across the east of Metro Manila.

These streams formerly run from the Katipunan Avenue, going to the garden itself and leaves the campus for the Commonwealth Avenue.

Diliman&apos;s academic arms also assume the title of &quot; School &quot; (such as the School of Economics), which might function independently and have their own departments or which may operate as a unit within a particular college. U.P. Diliman&apos;s institutes are headed by institute directors, who assume the duties assigned by the chancellor. Each director has a tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon the reappointment of the chancellor. A director cannot not be an academic head of any department or division under his institute. Each college or school is composed of clusters of institutes or departments. The university&apos;s departments are headed by department chairs, who assume the duties assigned by the dean and the chancellor. Each chair is appointed by the chancellor, as recommended by the dean or institute director, and has a tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon reappointment. Some units of the university are known as National Institutes, such as the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. The status of being an institute is determined by the Board of Regents, but recognition as a national institute is governed by Philippine legislation.

[ UP Diliman Faculty Manual http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf UP Diliman 9 August 2010 10 2003 ] U.P. Diliman is composed of 26 colleges, schools, and institutes. Officially, these are called degree-granting units. [ Academic Programs http://www.upd.edu.ph/acad.htm UP Diliman 7 August 2010 ] The oldest of these colleges is the College of Fine Arts, established in 1908 and originally located in Manila.

[ Grading system and calendar ] Academic performance is rated from 1.00 being excellent to 5.00 as failed. Grades 1.00 to 3.00 are separated by increments of 0.25 while 3.00 is followed immediately by 4.00 and then 5.00. Some professors 0.50 as increment instead, and some colleges, particularly College of Engineering do not give 4.00 grades. A grade of four is a conditional grade and a student needs to remove the grade of 4.00 during a prescribed period (usually determined by the college where he is enrolled) or else it will become 5.00 once that period has lapsed. A conditional grade can only be removed by a removal exam: if the student passes the exam, he will obtain a grade of 3.00, otherwise it is 5.00. An alternative for 4.00 is the rating of &quot; INC &quot;, which means incomplete, which is given to students who have unsatisfied requirements that are needed to finish their course. If a student drops before the subject dropping period his record for that subject will be replaced by &quot; DRP &quot;.

Diliman is all decked out for Christmas 2011. The Diliman community is sometimes referred to as the Diliman Republic and a &quot; microcosm of the Philippines &quot;. It is the only university in Metro Manila that has its own jeepney transportation system due to its sheer size. The university also has a congressional franchise to operate two radio stations (AM and FM) as well as a television station. Currently, the university only operates DZUP 1602, a community AM radio station. The campus encompasses a number of residential areas and many students claim a sense of solidarity with the residents of these immediate communities. U.P. Diliman represents the U.P. System in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) and participates in all events. The Fighting Maroons have perennially placed in the top three in the overall points race of the UAAP. One of the most popular athletic teams in the program is the U.P. Pep Squad, a heavyweight in the annual UAAP Cheerdance Competition. Two of the most-awaited events in the campus are the Lantern Parade, held on the last week before the Christmas break, and the U.P. Fair, held every February. During the Lantern Parade, the individual colleges as well as groups within U.P.D. create Christmas lanterns and floats and parade around the Academic Oval, culminating in a lengthy program held in front of the Amphitheater capped off by a massive fireworks display. In recent years the event has become so popular even outside of UP that media outlets and major Manila television networks regularly send crews to broadcast the event live.
