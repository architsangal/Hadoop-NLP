[ Design and development ] [ Background ] The Douglas Aircraft Company developed the DC-9 in the 1960s as a short-range companion to their larger DC-8. { Norris, Guy and Wagner, Mark. Douglas Jetliners. MBI Publishing, 1999. ISBN 0-7603-0676-1. } The DC-9 was an all-new design, using two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines, and a T-tail. The DC-9 has a narrow-body fuselage design with a 5-abreast seating with a capacity of 80 to 135 passengers depending on seating arrangement and aircraft version. The second generation of the DC-9 was originally called the DC-9-80 series or the DC-9 Super 80 but later marketed as the MD-80 { History - Chronology - 1977-1982, The Boeing Company. Retrieved 2007-12-14. } and entered service in 1980. McDonnell Douglas began studies into shorter derivatives of the MD-80 in 1983, these studies eventually becoming known as the MD-90. While for several years, McDonnell Douglas proposed powering the MD-90 with two propfan engines, by 1989, it was clear that there was insufficient interest in propjet powered aircraft, and reworked their proposals to feature the IAE V2500 turbofan instead. { Swanborough 1993, p.90. } [ MD-90 ] The MD-90 was firmly launched on November 14, 1989, when Delta Air Lines placed an order for 50 MD-90s, with options for a further 110 aircraft. The aircraft first flew on February 22, 1993 and the first MD-90 was delivered to Delta in February 1995. { MD-90 Background. The Boeing Company. Retrieved 2008-12-09. } The MD-90 was produced adjacent to the Long Beach Airport in Long Beach, California, USA, though two aircraft were produced at Jiangwan Airfield in Shanghai, People&apos;s Republic of China. { Shanghai Jiangwan Airfield. Global Security. Retrieved: 2008-12-09. } { International Aero Engines V2500 engine powering the MD-90 } The MD-90 is a mid-size, medium-range airliner that was developed from the MD-80 series. It is a [ 5 ft m in 2 ] longer, updated version of the MD-88 with similar electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and more powerful, quieter and fuel efficient IAE V2500 engines instead of the JT8D engines, which power the MD-80 series. Typical seating for the MD-90 ranges from 153 to 172 passengers depending on seating arrangement. { Technical Characteristics -- MD-90 Series. Boeing. } The MD-90 was produced in two versions: -30 and -30ER. The -30 had a range of 2,400 miles (3,860  km). The -30ER had a higher gross weight and range up to 2,750 miles (4,426  km) with an auxiliary fuel tank. An even longer range version, the -50 was offered but was not ordered. { MD-90 page, airliners.net. Retrieved 2008-12-08. } The initial MD-90s featured a glass cockpit similar to the MD-88&apos;s cockpit. { Becher 2002, p. 105. } The 29 MD-90s delivered to Saudi Arabian Airlines feature a full glass cockpit with avionics and an overhead display panel similar to the MD-11&apos;s cockpit for easy transition for the pilots within Saudi Arabian Airlines, which operate the MD-11. { Saudia Calls for Honeywell Flat Panel Cockpit Displays for New MD-90s.

Retrieved 2008-12-08. } MD-90 production at Long Beach, California ended in 2000 with the last airplane being delivered to Saudi Arabian Airlines, and MD-90T production at Shanghai ended in 2000. With 116 MD-90 aircraft produced, the MD-90 production run was the smallest among the DC-9 family. { Orders and Deliveries search page, The Boeing Company. Retrieved 2008-04-22. } Following the MD-90 in the DC-9 family was the MD-95, which was renamed the Boeing 717-200 after McDonnell Douglas (successor to Douglas Aircraft Company) merged with Boeing in 1997. { Boeing Chronology, 1997-2001, Boeing } The main competitors of the MD-90 included the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737-800.
