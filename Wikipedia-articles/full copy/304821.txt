The heat wave led to health crises in several countries and combined with drought to create a crop shortfall in Southern Europe. More than 70,000 Europeans died as a result of the heat wave.

Because of the usually relatively mild summers, most people did not know how to react to very high temperatures (for instance, with respect to rehydration ), and most single-family homes and residential facilities built in the last 50 years were not equipped with air conditioning. Furthermore, while there were contingency plans for a variety of natural and man-made catastrophes, high temperatures had never been considered a major hazard. The catastrophe occurred in August, a month in which many people, including government ministers and physicians, are on holiday. Many bodies were not claimed for many weeks because relatives were on holiday. A refrigerated warehouse outside Paris was used by undertakers as they did not have enough space in their own facilities. On 3 September 2003, fifty-seven bodies still left unclaimed in the Paris area were buried. The high number of deaths can be explained by the conjunction of seemingly unrelated events. Most nights in France are cool, even in summer. As a consequence, houses (usually of stone, concrete or brick construction) do not warm too much during the daytime and radiate minimal heat at night, and air conditioning is usually unnecessary. During the heat wave, temperatures remained at record highs even at night, preventing the usual cooling cycle. Elderly persons living by themselves had never faced such extreme hotness before and did not know how to react or were too mentally or physically impaired by the heat to make the necessary adaptations themselves. Elderly persons with family support or those residing in nursing homes were more likely to have others who could make the adjustments for them. This led to statistically improbable survival rates with the weakest group having fewer deaths than more physically fit persons; most of the heat victims came from the group of elderly persons not requiring constant medical care or living alone without immediate family. That shortcomings of the nation&apos;s health system could allow such a death toll is a matter of controversy in France. The administration of President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin laid the blame onfamilies who had left their elderly behind without caring for them, the 35-hour workweek, which affected the amount of time doctors could work and family practitioner s vacationing in August. Many companies traditionally closed in August, so people had no choice about when to vacation. Family doctors were still in the habit of vacationing at the same time. It is not clear that more physicians would have helped as the main limitation was not the health system but locating old people needing assistance. The opposition, as well as many of the editorials of the local press, have blamed the administration. Many blamed Health Minister Jean-François Mattei for failing to return from his vacation when the heat wave became serious, and his aides for blocking emergency measures in public hospitals (such as the recalling of physicians). A particularly vocal critic was Dr.   Patrick Pelloux, head of the union of emergency physicians, who blamed the Raffarin administration for ignoring warnings from health and emergency professionals and trying to minimize the crisis. Mattei lost his ministerial post in a cabinet reshuffle on 31 March 2004. Not everyone blamed the government. &quot; The French family structure is more dislocated than elsewhere in Europe, and prevailing social attitudes hold that once older people are closed behind their apartment doors or in nursing homes, they are someone else&apos;s problem, &quot; said Stéphane Mantion, an official with the French Red Cross. &quot; These thousands of elderly victims didn&apos;t die from a heat wave as such, but from the isolation and insufficient assistance they lived with day in and out, and which almost any crisis situation could render fatal. &quot; { www.time.com } [ Portugal ] There were extensive forest fires in Portugal. Five percent of the countryside and ten percent of the forests (215,000  hectares ) were destroyed, an estimated [ 4000 km2 sqmi ]. Eighteen people died in the fires and there were an estimated 1866 to 2039 heat related deaths over all. { http://www.onsa.pt/conteu/onda_2003_relatorio.pdf } Temperatures reached as high as [ 48 °C °F ] in Amareleja.

The heat wave here broke no records, although 4 tropical weather designated days in mid-July, preceding the official wave, are not counted due to a cool day in between and the nature of the Netherlands specification/definition of a heat wave. The highest temperature recorded this heatwave was on 7 August, when in Arcen, in Limburg, a temperature of 37.8  °C was reached, 0.8  °C below the national record (since 1704). It happened only twice that a higher temperature was recorded. On 8 August a temperature of 37.7  °C was recorded, and 12 August saw a temperature of 37.2  °C.

[ February 2007 ] But some experts suspect that the highest temperatures occurred in the upper Rhine plain, which is known for very high temperatures. At some stations (private stations, for example Mannheim or Frankenthal ), temperatures over [ 41 °C °F ] were reported, but not recognized by official statistics. With only half the normal rainfall, rivers were at their lowest this century, [ February 2007 ] and shipping could not navigate the Elbe or Danube. Around 300 people —mostly elderly—died during the 2003 heatwave in Germany. [ Switzerland ] Melting glacier s in the Alps caused avalanches and flash floods in Switzerland.

However, Atlantic cyclones brought cool and wet weather for a short while at the end of July and very beginning of August before the temperatures started to increase substantially from 3 August onwards. Several weather records were broken in the United Kingdom, including the UK&apos;s highest recorded temperature [ 38.5 C F ] at Gravesend in Kent on 10 August. London also recorded [ 38.0 °C °F ]. Scotland also broke its highest temperature record with [ 32.9 °C °F ] recorded in Greycrook in the Scottish borders on 9 August.

August was by far the warmest, sunniest and driest month, with temperatures roughly 2°C above average. The highest temperature recorded was [ 30.3 °C °F ] at Belderrig, County Mayo on 8 August. { Met Éireann – Monthly Weather Bulletin (June 2003) } { Met Éireann – Monthly Weather Bulletin (July 2003) } { Met Éireann – Monthly Weather Bulletin (August 2003) } [ Effects on crops ] Crops which suffered most from drought were grown in Southern Europe. [ Wheat ] The following shortfalls in wheat harvest occurred as a result of the long drought. [ April 2007 ] The long drought occurred because of the increasing temperature change which affects the whole globe. France – 20% Italy – 13% United Kingdom – 12% Ukraine – 75% (Unknown if affected by heatwave or an early freeze that year.) Moldova – 80% Many other countries had shortfalls of 5–10%, and the EU total production was down by 10  million tonnes, or 10%. [ April 2010 ] [ Grapes ] The heat wave greatly accelerated the ripening of grapes; also, the heat dehydrates the grapes, making for more concentrated juice. By mid-August, the grapes in certain vineyard s had already reached their nominal sugar content, possibly resulting in 12°–12.5° wines (see alcoholic degree ). Because of that, and also of the impending change to rainy weather, the harvest was started much earlier than usual (e.g. in mid-August for areas that are normally harvested in September). It is predicted that the wines from 2003, although in scarce quantity, will have exceptional quality, especially in France. The heat wave made Hungary fare extremely well in the Vinalies 2003 International wine contest: a total of nine gold and nine silver medals were awarded to Hungarian winemakers.

A seasonal current of the Central Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS), was affected by the warm temperatures, resulting in modifications in its path and intensity. The AIS is important for the reproduction biology of important pelagic commercial fish species, so the heatwave may have influenced indirectly the stocks of these species. Further studies will be addressed in this direction.
