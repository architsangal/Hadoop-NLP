In classical music from Western culture, the tritone ( [ Tritone on C.mid Play ], tri - &quot; three &quot; and tone ) is traditionally defined as a musical interval composed of three whole tones. In a chromatic scale, each whole tone can be further divided into two semitone s. In this context, a tritone may also be defined as any interval spanning six semitones. Since a chromatic scale is formed by 12 pitches, it contains 12 distinct tritones, each of which starting from a different pitch. According to a widely used naming convention, six of them are classified as augmented fourths, and the other six as diminished fifths. In a diatonic scale there is only one tritone, classified as an augmented fourth. For instance, in the C major diatonic scale the only interval formed by three adjacent tones (F-G, G-A, and A-B) is that from F to B. In the above-mentioned naming convention, a fourth is an interval encompassing four staff position s, while a fifth encompasses five staff positions (see interval number for more details).The augmented fourth (A4) and diminished fifth (d5) are defined as the intervals produced by widening and narrowing by one chromatic semitone the perfect fourth and fifth, respectively. { Bruce Benward &amp; Marilyn Nadine Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I, seventh edition (Boston: McGraw-Hill), p.  54. ISBN 978-0-07-294262-0. } They both span six semitones, and they are the inverse of each other, meaning that their sum is exactly equal to one perfect octave (A4 + d5 = P8).In 12-tone equal temperament, the most commonly used tuning system, the A4 is equivalent to a d5, as both have the size of exactly half an octave. In most other tuning systems, they are not equivalent, and neither is equal to half an octave. The d5 is also called semidiapente. The tritone is often used as the main interval of dissonance in Western harmony, and is important in the study of musical harmony. &quot; Any tendency for a tonality to emerge may be avoided by introducing a note three whole tones distant from the key note of that tonality. &quot; [ Brindle Reginald Smith Reginald Smith Brindle Serial Composition Oxford University Press 1966 0-19-311906-4 http://books.google.com/books?id%3DgvNLXHpusw8C 66 ] [ Definitions ] A tritone (abbreviation: TT) is traditionally defined as a musical interval composed of three whole tones. As the symbol for whole tone is T, this definition may be also written as follows: TT = T+T+T Only if the three tones are of the same size (which is not the case for many tuning system s ) can this formula be simplified to: TT = 3T This definition, however, has two different interpretations (broad and strict). [ Broad interpretation (chromatic scale) ] If a chromatic scale is used, with its 12 notes it is possible to define 12 different tritones, each of which starting from a different note. Six of them are A4, and the other six are d5. Therefore, in this case both A4 and d5 are considered to be tritones. Since each whole tone, in a chromatic scale, can be divided into two semitone s : T = S+S then three tones are equal to six semitones. In this case, we can generalize the definition of tritone as follows: TT = T+T+T = S+S+S+S+S+S. This means that a tritone can be also defined as any musical interval spanning six semitones (indeed, both A4 and d5 are intervals spanning 6 semitones). Only when the semitones (and the tones formed by pairs of semitones) are equal in size can this formula be simplified to: TT = 3T = 6S. [ Strict interpretation (diatonic scale) ] In a diatonic scale, whole tones are regarded as incomposite interval s (that is, they do not divide into smaller intervals). Therefore, in this context the above mentioned &quot; decomposition &quot; of the tritone into six semitones is typically not allowed. If a diatonic scale is used, with its 7 notes it is possible to form only one sequence of three adjacent whole tones (T+T+T). This interval is an A4, and it is sometimes called the proper tritone. For instance, in the C major diatonic scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-...), the only tritone is from F to B. It is a tritone because F-G, G-A, and A-B are three adjacent whole tones. It is a fourth because the notes from F to B are four (F, G, A, B). It is augmented (i.e., widened) because most of the fourths found in the scale have smaller size (they are perfect fourth s ). According to this interpretation, the d5 is not a tritone. Indeed, in a diatonic scale, there&apos;s only one d5, and this interval does not meet the strict definition of tritone, as it is formed by one semitone, two whole tones, and another semitone: d5 = S+T+T+S. For instance, in the C major diatonic scale, the only d5 is from B to F. It is a fifth because the notes from B to F are five (B, C, D, E, F). It is diminished (i.e. narrowed) because most of the fifths found in the scale have larger size (they are perfect fifth s ). [ Alternative definition ] Some contemporary authors define a tritone as any interval spanning exactly half an octave, including both the A4 and d5 as tuned in 12-tone equal temperament. This is not consistent with the above mentioned traditional definition (TT = T+T+T). In this case, context may resolve the tritone to more an A4, a d5, or a &quot; neutral &quot; interval with no clear conventional classification. [ Size in different tuning systems ] In 12-tone equal temperament, the A4 is exactly half an octave (i.e., a ratio of &amp; radic;2 :1 or 600 cents; [ Tritone.mid play ] ). The inverse of 600 cents is 600 cents. Thus, in this tuning system, the A4 and its inverse (d5) are equivalent. The half-octave A4 is unique in being equal to its own inverse. In other meantone tuning systems, besides 12-tone equal temperament, A4 and d5 are distinct intervals because neither is exactly half an octave. In any meantone tuning near to [ 2 9 ] -comma meantone the A4 will be near to the ratio [ 7 5 ] and the d5 to [ 10 7 ], which is what these intervals are taken to be in septimal meantone temperament. In 31 equal temperament, for example, the A4, a [ 10 7 ], or tritone proper, is 617.49 cents, whereas a [ 7 5 ] is 582.51 cents. This is perceptually indistinguishable from septimal meantone temperament. Since they are the inverse of each other, by definition A4 and d5 always add up to exactly one perfect octave : A4 + d5 = P8. On the other hand, two A4 (proper tritones) add up to six whole tones. In equal temperament, this is equal to exactly one perfect octave: A4 + A4 = P8. In quarter-comma meantone temperament, this is a diesis (128/125) less than a perfect octave: A4 + A4 = P8 - diesis. In just intonation several different sizes can be chosen both for the A4 and the d5. For instance, in 5-limit tuning, the A4 is either 45/32 { Partch, Harry. (1974).

[ Dissonance and expressiveness ] Compared to other commonly occurring intervals like the major second or the minor third, the augmented fourth and the diminished fifth (both two valid enharmonic interpretations of the tritone) are considered awkward intervals to sing. Western composers have traditionally avoided using it explicitly in their melody lines, often preferring to use passing tones or extra note skipping instead of using a direct leap of an augmented fourth or diminished fifth in their melodies. However, as time went by, composers have gradually used the tritone more and more in their music, disregarding its awkwardness and exploiting its expressiveness. [ May 2008 ] [ The unstable character of the tritone sets it apart, as discussed in [28] [ Paul Hindemith. The Crafts of Musical Composition, Book I. Associated Music Publishers, New York, 1945]. It can be expressed as a ratio by compounding suitable superparticular ratios. Whether it is assigned the ratio 64/45 or 45/32, depending on the musical context, or indeed some other ratio, it is not superparticular, which is in keeping with its unique role in music. Haluska (2003), p.  286. ] [ Although this ratio [45/32] is composed of numbers which are multiples of 5 or under, they are excessively large for a 5-limit scale, and are sufficient justification, either in this form or as the tempered &quot; tritone, &quot; for the epithet &quot; diabolic, &quot; which has been used to characterize the interval. This is a case where, because of the largeness of the numbers, none but a temperament -perverted ear could possibly prefer 45/32 to a small-number interval of about the same width. Partch (1974), p.  115. ISBN 0-306-80106-X. ] [ In the Pythagorean ratio 81/64 both numbers are multiples of 3 or under, yet because of their excessive largeness the ear certainly prefers 5/4 for this approximate degree, even though it involves a prime number higher than 3. In the case of the 45/32, &apos;tritone&apos; our theorists have gone around their elbows to reach their thumbs, which could have been reached simply and directly and non-&apos;diabolically&apos; via number 7. ] [ Common uses ] [ Occurrences in diatonic scales ] The proper tritone (A4) occurs naturally between the fourth and seventh scale degrees of the major scale (for example, from F to B in the key of C major ). It is also present in the natural minor scale as the interval formed between the second and sixth scale degrees (for example, from D to A [ flat ] in the key of C minor ). The melodic minor scale, having two forms, presents a tritone in different locations when ascending and descending (when the scale ascends, the tritone appears between the third and sixth scale degrees and the fourth and seventh scale degrees, and when the scale descends, the tritone appears between the second and sixth scale degrees). Supertonic chords using the notes from the natural minor mode will thus contain a tritone, regardless of inversion. [ Occurrences in chords ] The dominant seventh chord contains a (d5) tritone within its tone construction: it occurs between the third and seventh above the root. In addition, augmented sixth chord s, some of which are enharmonic to dominant seventh chords, contain tritones spelled as augmented fourths (for example, the German sixth, from A to D [ sharp ] in the key of A minor ); the French sixth chord can be viewed as a superposition of two tritones a major second apart. The diminished chord also contains a tritone in its construction, deriving its name from the diminished fifth interval (i.e. a tritone). The half-diminished seventh chord contains the same tritone, while the fully diminished seventh chord is made up of two superposed tritones a minor third apart. Other chords built on these, such as ninth chord s, often include tritones (as diminished fifths). [ Resolution ] Tritone resolution inward. [ Tritone resolution inward.ogg Tritone resolution inward Tritone resolution inward to a major third. Ogg ] In all of the sonorities mentioned above, used in functional harmonic analysis, the tritone pushes towards resolution, generally resolving by step in contrary motion. The inversion of this, a diminished fifth resolving inward to a major third, is often loosely called a tritone as well in modern tonal theory, but functionally and notationally it can only resolve inwards as a kind of fifth and is therefore not reckoned a tritone in baroque and renaissance music theory. [ Other uses ] The tritone is also one of the defining features of the Locrian mode, being featured between the [ scale 1 ] and fifth scale degrees. The half-octave tritone interval is used in the musical/auditory illusion known as the tritone paradox. [ Historical uses ] The tritone is a restless interval, classed as a dissonance in Western music from the early Middle Ages through to the end of the common practice period. This interval was frequently avoided in medieval ecclesiastical singing because of its dissonant quality. The first explicit prohibition of it seems to occur with the development of Guido of Arezzo &apos;s hexachord al system, which made B [ flat ] a diatonic note, namely as the fourth degree of the hexachord on F. From then until the end of the Renaissance the tritone, nicknamed the diabolus in musica, was regarded as an unstable interval and rejected as a consonance by most theorists. [ Drabkin William Tritone Grove Music Online (subscription access) Oxford Music Online http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/28403 2008-07-21 ] The name diabolus in musica ( &quot; the Devil in music &quot; ) has been applied to the interval from at least the early 18th century. Johann Joseph Fux cites the phrase in his seminal 1725 work Gradus ad Parnassum, Georg Philipp Telemann in 1733 notes, &quot; mi against fa &quot;, which the ancients called &quot; Satan in music &quot;, and Johann Mattheson in 1739 writes that the &quot; older singers with solmization called this pleasant interval &apos;mi contra fa&apos; or &apos;the devil in music&apos; &quot;. [ Reinhold Hammerstein Diabolus in musica: Studien zur Ikonographie der Musik im Mittelalter Neue Heidelberger Studien zur Musikwissenschaft 6 1974 Francke Bern German 1390982 7...mi contra fa... welches die alten den Satan in der Music nenneten &quot; &quot;...alten Solmisatores dieses angenehme Intervall mi contra fa oder den Teufel in der Music genannt haben. ] Although the latter two of these authors cite the association with the devil as from the past, there are no known citations of this term from the Middle Ages, as is commonly asserted. { F. J. Smith, &quot; Some Aspects of the Tritone and the Semitritone in the Speculum Musicae: The Non-Emergence of the Diabolus in Music, &quot; Journal of Musicological Research 3 (1979), pp.  63-74, at 70. } However Denis Arnold, in the The New Oxford Companion to Music, suggests that the nickname was already applied early in the medieval music itself: It seems first to have been designated as a &quot; dangerous &quot; interval when Guido of Arezzo developed his system of hexachords and with the introduction of B flat as a diatonic note, at much the same time acquiring its nickname of &quot; Diabolus in Musica &quot; ( &quot; the devil in music &quot; ). { Arnold, Denis (1983) « Tritone » in The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J,Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-311316-3 } Because of that original symbolic association with the devil and its avoidance, this interval came to be heard in Western cultural convention as suggesting an &quot; evil &quot; connotative meaning in music. Today the interval continues to suggest an &quot; oppressive &quot;, &quot; scary &quot;, or &quot; evil &quot; sound. However, suggestions that singers were excommunicated or otherwise punished by the Church for invoking this interval are likely fanciful [ November 2011 ]. At any rate, avoidance of the interval for musical reasons has a long history, stretching back to the parallel organum of the Musica Enchiriadis. In all these expressions, including the commonly cited &quot; mi contra fa est diabolus in musica &quot;, the &quot; mi &quot; and &quot; fa &quot; refer to notes from two adjacent hexachord s. For instance, in the tritone B-F, B would be &quot; mi &quot;, that is the third scale degree in the &quot; hard &quot; hexachord beginning on G, while F would be &quot; fa &quot;, that is the fourth scale degree in the &quot; natural &quot; hexachord beginning on C. Later in history with the rise of the Baroque and Classical music era, that interval came to be perfectly accepted, but yet was used in a specific controlled way, notably through the principle of the tension/release mechanism of the tonal system. In that system (which is the fundamental musical grammar of Baroque and Classical music), the tritone is one of the defining intervals of the dominant-seventh chord and two tritones separated by a minor third give the fully diminished seventh chord its characteristic sound. In minor, the diminished triad (comprising two minor thirds which together add up to a tritone) appears on the second scale degree, and thus features prominently in the progression ii o -V-i. Often, the inversion ii o6 is used to move the tritone to the inner voices as this allows for stepwise motion in the bass to the dominant root. In three-part counterpoint, free use of the diminished triad in first inversion is permitted, as this eliminates the tritone relation to the bass.

The tritone was also exploited heavily in that period as an interval of modulation for its ability to evoke a strong reaction by moving quickly to distantly related key s. Later on, in twelve-tone music, serialism, and other 20th century compositional idioms it came to be considered as a neutral interval. [ Persichetti Vincent Vincent Persichetti Twentieth-century Harmony: Creative Aspects and Practice 1961 W. W. Norton New York 0-393-09539-8 398434 ] In some analyses of the works of 20th century composers, the tritone plays an important structural role; perhaps the most noted is the axis system, proposed by Ernő Lendvaï, in his analysis of the use of tonality in the music of Béla Bartók. [ Lendvaï Ernő Ernő Lendvaï Béla Bartók: An Analysis of his Music introd. by Alan Bush 1971 Kahn &amp; Averill London 0-900707-04-6 240301 1–16 ] Tritone relations are also important in the music of George Crumb. George Harrison uses tritones on the downbeats of the opening phrases of the Beatles songs &quot; The Inner Light &quot;, &quot; Blue Jay Way &quot; and &quot; Within You Without You &quot;, creating a prolonged sense of suspended resolution. { Dominic Pedler. The Songwriting Secrets of the Beatles. Music Sales Ltd. Omnibus Press. London, 2010 pp. 522–523 } { Tritone substitution : F } [ # ] { 7 may substitute for C7, and vice versa, because they both share E } [ natural ] { and B } [ flat ] { /A } [ sharp ] { and due to } { voice leading considerations. } [ Tritone substitution.mid Play ] Tritones also became important in the development of jazz tertian harmony, where triads and seventh chords are often expanded to become 9th, 11th, or 13th chords, and the tritone often occurs as a substitute for the naturally occurring interval of the perfect 11th. Since the perfect 11th (i.e. an octave plus perfect fourth) is typically perceived as a dissonance requiring a resolution to a major or minor 10th, chords that expand to the 11th or beyond typically raise the 11th a half step (thus giving us an augmented or sharp 11th, or an octave plus a tritone from the root of the chord) and present it in conjunction with the perfect 5th of the chord. Also in jazz harmony, the tritone is both part of the dominant chord and its substitute dominant (also known as the sub V chord). Because they share the same tritone, they are possible substitutes for one another. This is known as a tritone substitution. The tritone substitution is one of the most common chord and improvisation devices in jazz. [ In the theory of harmony it is known that a diminished interval needs to be resolved inwards, and an augmented interval outwards....and with the correct resolution of the truetritones this desire is totally satisfied. However, if one plays a justdiminished fifth that is perfectly in tune, for example, there is no wish to resolve it to a major third. Just the opposite--aurally one wants to enlarge it to a minor sixth. The opposite holds true for the justaugmented fourth.... These apparently contradictory aural experiences become understandable when the cents of both types of just tritones are compared with those of the true tritones and then read &apos;crossed-over&apos;. One then notices that the just augmented fourth of 590.224 cents is only 2 cents bigger than the true diminished fifth of 588.270 cents, and that both intervals lie below the middle of the octave of 600.000 cents. It is no wonder that, following the ear, we want to resolve both downwards. The ear only desires the tritone to be resolved upwards when it is bigger than the middle of the octave. Therefore the opposite is the case with the just diminished fifth of 609.776 cents.... ] [ See also ] List of meantone intervals List of musical intervals Hexatonic scale#Tritone scale Unequal fifths [ Footnotes ] [ External links ] [ http://www.cameron.edu/~lloydd/webdoc1.html Tritone paradox and Shepard Tones 20080106220501 ] BBC News Magazine article about the tritone Satan&apos;s all-time greatest hit: Will Hodgkinson on the devil&apos;s interval Tritone article by JazzPianoLessons.com Category:Intervals ca:Tríton cs:Tritón da:Tritonus de:Tritonus et:Tritoon es:Tritono eo:Diminuita kvinto fr:Triton (musique) ko:셋온음 hr:Tritonus is:Tónskratti it:Tritono he:טריטון (מוזיקה) lt:Tritonis nl:Tritonus ja:三全音 no:Tritonus pl:Tryton (muzyka) pt:Trítono ru:Тритон (интервал) sl:Tritonus fi:Tritonus sv:Tritonus uk:Тритон (інтервал) zh:增四度
