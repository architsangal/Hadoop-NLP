[ 1955 05 16 1909 11 27 ] { New York City, New York } { United States } { A Death in the Family, } { Let Us Now Praise Famous Men } James Rufus Agee ( [ icon ˈ eɪ dʒ iː ] [ AY jee ]; November 27, 1909 – May 16, 1955) was an American author, journalist, poet, screenwriter and film critic. In the 1940s, he was one of the most influential film critics in the U.S. His autobiographical novel, A Death in the Family ( 1957 ), won the author a posthumous 1958 Pulitzer Prize. [ Biography ] { Fort Sanders neighborhood of } { Knoxville, Tennessee is named after the author. Fort Sanders was Agee&apos;s childhood home and the setting for his novel &apos;&apos; } { A Death in the Family &apos;&apos;. } James Agee was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, at Highland Avenue and 15th Street (renamed James Agee Street in 1999) in what is now the Fort Sanders neighborhood to Hugh James Agee and Laura Whitman Tyler.

Chicago Tribune February 27, 1977 2010-12-04 ] When Agee was six, his father was killed in an automobile accident. From the age of seven, Agee and his younger sister, Emma, were educated in boarding school s. The most influential of these was located near his mother&apos;s summer cottage two miles from Sewanee, Tennessee. Saint Andrews School for Mountain Boys was run by Episcopal monks affiliated with the Order of the Holy Cross. It was there that Agee&apos;s lifelong friendship with Episcopal priest Father James Harold Flye and his wife began in 1919. As Agee&apos;s close friend and spiritual confidant, Flye received many of Agee&apos;s most revealing letters. Agee&apos;s mother married Father Erskind Wright in 1924, and the two moved to Rockland, Maine. { Agee Chronology } Agee went to Knoxville High School for the 1924–1925 school year, then traveled with Father Flye to Europe in the summer, when Agee was sixteen. On their return, Agee transferred to a boarding school in New Hampshire, entering the class of 1928 at Phillips Exeter Academy. Soon after, he began a correspondence with Dwight Macdonald. At Phillips Exeter, Agee was president of The Lantern Club and editor of the Monthly where his first short stories, plays, poetry and articles were published. Despite barely passing many of his high school courses, Agee was admitted to Harvard University &apos;s class of 1932. There Agee took classes taught by Robert Hillyer and I. A. Richards; his classmate in those was the future poet and critic Robert Fitzgerald, with whom he would eventually work at TIME. Agee was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Advocate and delivered the class ode at his commencement. Soon after graduation, he married Via Saunders on January 28, 1933; they divorced in 1938. Later that same year, he married Alma Mailman (they divorced in 1941). In 1941 Alma moved to Mexico with their year-old son Joel, to live with Communist politician and writer Bodo Uhse. In 1946 son Stefan (Uhse) was born, who later took his own life in New York in 1973. The family moved to Berlin in 1948. The marriage lasted until 1960, when Alma Agee and her sons went back to the USA. In 1982 Joel Agee published a memoir of his youth among the communist elite of the German Democratic Republic called Twelve Years: An American Boyhood in East Germany. A second memoir of his life in the 1960s is In the House of My Fear (2004) and translated German writers Heinrich von Kleist (Penthesilea), Elias Canetti (aphorisms), a lot of Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Hans Erich Nossak (The End - Hamburg 1943 2006) and others. James Agee began living in Greenwich Village with Mia Fritsch, whom he married in 1946. They had two daughters, Teresa and Andrea, and a son John. In 1951 in Santa Barbara, Agee, a hard drinker and chain-smoker, suffered the first two in a series of heart attack s. Four years later, on May 16, 1955, Agee was in New York City when he suffered a fatal second heart attack. Agee, 45, died in a taxi cab en route to a doctor&apos;s appointment, two days before the anniversary of his father&apos;s death. { James Agee (1909-1955) Chronology of his Life and Work } He was buried on a farm he owned at Hillsdale, New York, property still held by Agee descendants. [ Career ] After graduation, Agee moved to New York, where he wrote for Fortune and Time magazines, although he is better known for his later film criticism in The Nation. In 1934, he published his only volume of poetry, Permit Me Voyage, with a foreword by Archibald MacLeish. In the summer of 1936, during the Great Depression, Agee spent eight weeks on assignment for Fortune with photographer Walker Evans, living among sharecroppers in Alabama. While Fortune did not publish his article, Agee turned the material into a book entitled, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941). It sold only 600 copies before being remaindered. Agee left Fortune in 1939. In 1942, Agee became the film critic for Time; at one point, he also reviewed up to six books per week. Together, he and friend Whittaker Chambers ran &quot; the back of the book &quot; for Time. [ Chambers Whittaker http://www.whittakerchambers.org/ Witness Random House 1952 0-89526-571-0 478, 493, 504, 615 ] He left to become film critic for The Nation. In 1948, Agee quit both magazines to become a freelance writer. One of his assignments was a well-received article for Life Magazine about the great silent movie comedian s Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon. The article has been credited for reviving Keaton&apos;s career. As a freelancer in the 1950s, Agee continued to write magazine articles while working on movie scripts, often with photographer Helen Levitt. Agee was an ardent champion of Charlie Chaplin &apos;s then unpopular film Monsieur Verdoux (1947), since recognized as a film classic. He was also a great admirer of Laurence Olivier &apos;s Henry V and Hamlet, especially Henry V. He published three separate reviews of the movie, all of which have been printed in the collection Agee on Film. [ Screenwriting ] Agee&apos;s career as a movie scriptwriter was curtailed by his alcoholism. Nevertheless he is one of the credited screenwriters on two of the most respected films of the 1950s: The African Queen ( 1951 ) and The Night of the Hunter ( 1955 ). His contribution to Hunter is shrouded in controversy. Some critics have claimed the published script was written by the film&apos;s director Charles Laughton. Reports that Agee&apos;s screenplay for Hunter was incoherent have been proved false by the 2004 discovery of his first draft, which although 293 pages in length, is scene for scene the film which Laughton directed. While not yet published, the first draft has been read by scholars, most notably Professor Jeffrey Couchman of Columbia University. He credited Agee in the essay, &quot; Credit Where Credit Is Due. &quot; Also false were reports that Agee was fired from the film. Laughton renewed Agee&apos;s contract and directed him to cut the script in half, which Agee did. Later, apparently at Robert Mitchum&apos;s request, Agee visited the set to settle a dispute between the star and Laughton. Letters and documents located in the archive of Agee&apos;s agent Paul Kohner bear this out; they were documented by Laughton&apos;s biographer Simon Callow, whose BFI book about The Night of the Hunter set this part of the record straight. [ Legacy ] During his lifetime, Agee enjoyed only modest public recognition. Since his death, his literary reputation has grown. In 1957, his novel, A Death in the Family (based on the events surrounding his father&apos;s death), was published posthumously and in 1958 won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. In 2007, Dr. Michael Lofaro published a restored edition of the novel using Agee&apos;s original manuscripts. Agee&apos;s work had been heavily edited before its original publication by publisher David McDowell. { James Agee and Michael A. Lofaro, ed. A Death in the Family: A Restoration of the Author&apos;s Text. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2007. ISBN 1-57233-594-7 } Agee&apos;s reviews and screenplays have been collected in two volumes of Agee on Film. The issues related to The Night of the Hunter attracted controversy. Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, ignored on its original publication in 1941, has been placed among the greatest literary works of the 20th century by the New York School of Journalism and the New York Public Library. The composer Samuel Barber set sections of &quot; Descriptions of Elysium &quot; from Permit Me Voyage to music, creating a song of &quot; Sure On This Shining Night. &quot; In addition, he set prose from the &quot; Knoxville &quot; section of A Death in the Family in his work for soprano and orchestra entitled Knoxville: Summer of 1915. &quot; Sure On This Shining Night &quot; has also been set to music by composers Z. Randall Stroope and Morten Lauridsen. The 2012 documentary film &apos; Shining Night: A Portrait of Composer Morten Lauridsen &apos; includes Lauridsen&apos;s composition of &apos;Sure On This Shining Night&apos; in the soundtrack.
